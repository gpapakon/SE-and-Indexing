<ABSTRACT>
A package of shirred food casing sticks wherein 
the sticks are bundled together by a wrap disposed in 

tension transversely about the bundle and the opposite 
ends of the wrap are overlapped and releasably 

connected. The releasable connection attaches the 
outer surface 31 of the underlying wrapper end 26 to 

the inner surface 30 of the overlying wrapper end 38 
and the overlying end having an outer margin which is 

free and loose from the connection to provide a means 
for grasping and pulling overlying end free of the 

connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package of shirred food
casings and more particularly to a package including a hexagonal bundle
of shirred casings retained in an easy to open plastic bag.Small diameter sausages such as frankfurters or the like
usually are made using food casings of cellulose. Cellulose food casings
and the like customarily are manufactured in long continuous tubular
lengths. For handling convenience, these long tubular lengths are
gathered into pleats by shirring and are longitudinally compressed by
known techniques to obtain a shorter, relatively rigid tubular element
known in the industry as a shirred casing stick. The coherency of a
shirred stick is derived in part from the shirring operation which forms
the casing into generally conical pleats which nest one within another.During a stuffing operation the stick is loaded onto a
stuffing horn and a food emulsion is fed through the horn and into casing
which is drawn forward from the stick by the stuffing pressure. It is not
uncommon for a shirred stick 50 cm long to contain upwards of 50 
meters or more of casing so a large number of individual frankfurters are
made with each stick.Packaging and shipping of shirred sticks presents several
problems particularly for the type of casings used for frankfurters. These
casings generally have a wall thickness of only about 0.025 mm to about
0.05 mm and shirred sticks of this casing are relatively fragile in that the
nested pleats of casing formed by the shirring operation are easily
separated or pulled apart. If the pleats separate, the stick is said to
break or lose "coherency". The result is one or more rigid shirred
sections connected by loose unshirred sections. Sticks in this condition
are not easily loaded onto a stuffing horn and are not at all suitable for
automatic stuffing operations wherein the stick is loaded onto a stuffing
horn by mechanical means. Accordingly, the packaging for the shirred
sticks must be able to minimize stick breakage.Shirred sticks also are susceptible to damage if made wet.
Since stuffing machines frequently are hosed down with water after a
stuffing operation, any sticks in the area must be retained in packaging
which provides a barrier to water spray and is not itself damaged by
water contact.In commercial practice it generally is customary to package
sticks in tight bundles of fifty (50) sticks. Bundling sticks together
accomplishes several functions. For example, a tight bundle helps to
prevent bowing of individual sticks. Bowing is the result of a
