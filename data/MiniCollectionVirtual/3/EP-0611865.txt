<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates, among devices for closing windows of the "sliding pane" type with a jamb, those which include a safety system for guarding against incorrect operation. The device according to the invention is characterised essentially by the fact that it includes a lock 4 located on the sliding pane and a latch 5 located on the jamb and including an open housing 6 delimited by a projecting part 7, the lock including a body 8 in the form of a slideway 9 like a hollow 10, a slide 11 mounted so that it can move translationally inside the slideway, a hook 12 mounted integral with the slide and emerging from the body through a slot 13 made in this body, a rod 20 mounted in the body 8 and capable of assuming a position of rest 21 and a working position 22, elastic means for tensioning so as to hold and return the rod to its position of rest, and means 27 for causing the rod to pass from its position of rest into its working position when the lock 4 and the catch 5 come close to one another, the slide 11 including a limit stop 24 capable of coming into contact with a first end 25 of the rod when it is in its position of rest 21 and a notch 26 close to the limit stop capable of receiving the first end of the rod when it is in the working position 22.
