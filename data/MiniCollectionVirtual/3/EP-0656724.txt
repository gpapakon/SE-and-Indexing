<ABSTRACT>
A sensor system includes a sensor having a 
planar array of sensor elements, each of which 

produces an output responsive to an energy input. 
The sensed energy reaching the sensor elements is 

controlled by at least two, and preferably a 
plurality of, light valves. A controller selects 

one of the light valves at a time to transmit energy 
of a scene segment impinging upon the light valve. 

An optical fiber bundle includes an optical fiber 
cable for each light valve extending from the sensor 

to the respective light valve. Each optical fiber 
cable has an optical fiber for each element of the 

sensor array. Preferably, each light valve is 
divided into a plurality of pixels, arranged such 

that the optical fibers of each optical fiber cable 
map the energy impinging upon each pixel of one of 

the light valves to a corresponding respective 
planar sensor element of the sensor array. A lens 

focuses a scene onto the light valves, such that a 
segment of the scene is imaged onto each of the 

light valves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sensor systems for 
viewing scenes, and, more particularly, such a 
sensor system that achieves a high resolution over a 
large area, with no moving parts in the system. As used herein, a sensor system is a device 
that converts an image into a signal which may be 
further analyzed. The sensor system typically 
includes a sensor device and an optical system that 
images a scene onto the sensor device. The visible 
or non-visible energy radiated from a scene is 
imaged onto the sensor by the optical system. The 
sensor converts the energy of the imaged scene into 
electrical signals. These signals are displayed, 
stored, or processed by a computer to analyze the 
content of the scene. A television camera is one type of sensor 
system that converts visible light to an electrical 
signal. In other applications, lighter, smaller 
sensor systems, such as those employing a planar 
sensor arrav, are used. Such a planar array sensor 
has a large number of individual sensor elements 
that each receive energy and produce a responsive 
electrical output signal. The type of energy to 
which the sensor responds is determined by the 
detailed structure of the sensor element. Sensor 
elements are available for a wide range of visible 
light, infrared, and other wavelengths of energy. 
The sensor elements are provided in a large array, 
which in some current approaches is 256 x 256 
elements in size, but may be larger or smaller. 
Thus, the planar sensor array may have tens of 
thousands of individual sensor elements. An optical  
 
system is typically provided to focus a scene onto 
the planar sensor array. The resolution of a sensor system, including 
a planar sensor array coupled with an optical 
system, is measured by the angular size of an object 
that is subtended by a sensor element. The smaller 
the angle that may be resolved, the higher the 
resolution of the sensor. For any one sensor 
element, it is usually the case that the greater the 
resolution, the smaller the field of view of the 
sensor. To increase the field of view of the sensor 
system without a loss of resolution, a sensor system 
may be constructed to view a small angular scene. 
The sensor array is mounted on a gimballed support 
driven by a controllable motor. The gimbal is 
driven to scan across a larger scene, so that the 
sensor array views only a small portion of the scene 
at any moment. A complete, high resolution image of 
the entire scene can be constructed by storing the 
images taken as the sensor array is
