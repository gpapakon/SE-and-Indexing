<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a surface treatment device for 
performing a surface treatment such as plating by feeding a 

treating liquid to an internal peripheral surface of a 
cylindrical portion of a work wherein a jig to be connected to 

said work includes a seal member adapted to be inserted to an 
opened portion of said cylindrical portion of the work and that 

seal operating means are provided for imparting an outwardly 
inflating force to the seal member in order to seal the inner 

periphery of the cylindrical portion of the work. 
Alternatively, the seal member can also be attached directly to 

a tip end of a fluid passage constituting member such as an 
electrode providing seal operating means as well which assure 

an inflating force to be provided so that the seal member is 
maintained in pressure engagement within said periphery of the 

cylindrical portion of the work.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface treatment device for carrying out a 
surface treating method applied for a plating treatment, a pretreatment 
therefor, etc. in the plating of an inside periphery of a cylindrical portion 
of a works, such as a cylinder block of an engine, and especially for 
subjecting a surface to be treated to a high speed surface treatment while 
allowing a treating liquid to flow. A variety of techniques concerning surface treatment such as 
plating of a surface to be treated of a work or a degreasing 
treatment as a pretreatment therefor have been hitherto 
known (DE 39 37 763 C2, FR 2 685 924 A1). For example, a 
method is generally known in which a work is immersed in a 
treating liquid contained in a tank for performing plating, 
etc. This method, however, requires a long treatment time 
and is not efficient. Additionally, this method requires 
high costs for the treatment of a waste liquid, etc. Thus, a method is proposed in which a treating liquid is allowed to flow 
relative to a surface to be treated of a work with a view toward improving 
the treating efficiency and realizing a high speed treatment. For example, 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 1-52480 discloses a surface 
treatment device applied for the degreasing treatment in chrome plating of 
an inside surface of a cylinder of an engine, in which each of the openings 
at both ends of the engine cylinder is plugged with a plug through a sealing 
material. One of the plugs is provided with a treating liquid feed passage 
while the other plug is provided with a treating liquid return passage. The 
both passages are in fluid communication with the inside space of the 
cylinder. A tank for the treating liquid, a pump, valves, etc. are connected 
to a piping system including the above passages. In the thus constructed 
device, the treating liquid is recirculated with a pump through the treating 
liquid feed passage--inside of the cylinder--treating liquid return 
passage--tank. The flow of the treating liquid through the inside of the 
cylinder permits a high speed treatment of the inside the surface the 
cylinder.  
 While the above publication mainly describes a case in which the device 
is applied for a degreasing step, it is also effective to allow a plating 
liquid to flow relative to a surface to be treated of a work in a plating 
step. Especially when an inside peripheral surface of a cylindrical portion 
of a cylinder or the like is subjected to plating, a high speed plating 
treatment can be accomplished
