<ABSTRACT>
A minimally invasive intravascular medical device (10) for providing 
a radiation treatment in a body passageway such as a coronary vessel 

of the vascular system. The device (10) includes a flexible elongated 
member (11) having distal (14) and proximal (13) portions. The 

distal portion (14) is percutaneously insertable 
into a vessel and includes a distal end (15) that 

is directable through the vessel to the treatment site. A radiation 
source (12) is attached about the distal portion (14) for delivering a 

radiation treatment to the walls a vessel having a stent positioned 
thereagainst. The distal portion of the elongated member includes a 

wire coil (16) positioned about the tapered distal end (22) of 
a mandril wire (21). The combination of the wire coil (16) and the 

tapered distal end (22) of the mandril wire (21) provides 
variable flexibility to the distal portion (14) of 

the device. The distal portion (14) also has a predetermined curvature 
for directing the distal end (15) of the device (10) through the 

vessel. A safety wire is also extendable 
through the passageway of the wire coil 

to provide further flexibility to the distal portion. The radiation 
source is fixedly positioned about either the tapered distal end of 

the mandril wire or the safety wire in the passageway of the wire 
coil. An annular recess is included about the tapered distal end of 

the mandril wire to fixedly position a source of 
radioactive material therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to minimally invasive medical devices such as 
wire guides or catheters. In addition to balloon, angioplasty or laser ablation a coronary stent can 
be positioned in a treated vessel to maintain the patency of the vessel. However, one 
problem is that smooth muscle proliferates or intimal hyperplasia occurs in response 
to the presence of the stent in the vessel. As a result, restenosis of the vessel 
typically occurs within a period of six months. Another problem is that abrasion or dissection of the vessel wall may 
occur during a therapeutic procedure to reopen or enlarge the lumen of the vessel. 
As a result, thrombi formation and occlusion of the vessel lumen may also occur. These problems apply to parts of the vascular system other than 
coronary vessels, such as the occlusion of the femoral or iliac vessels. FR-A-2348715 describes a medical device as described in the preamble 
of claim 1. According to the invention there is provided a device as claimed in 
claim 1. Preferred features of the invention are set out in the dependent claims. The device can provide localized radiation treatment in a body 
passageway such as a coronary vessel in the vascular system. That decreases 
reproduction of intimal and smooth muscle cells to prevent or curtail intimal 
hyperplasia and smooth muscle proliferation. Advantageously, restenosis of the 
treated vessel is significantly minimized. The distal portion preferably has a distal 
end that is directable through the tortuous segments of coronary vessels. FIG. 1 depicts the minimally invasive medical device of the present 
invention; FIG. 2 depicts an enlarged view of the distal portion of the medical 
device of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 depicts an alternative enhancement to the minimally invasive 
medical device of FIG. 1; FIG. 4 depicts a second alternative enhancement to the minimally 
invasive medical device of FIG. 1; and FIG. 5  
 
depicts an enhancement to the distal portion of the 
medical device of FIG.1. Depicted in Fig.1 is preferred embodiment of an illustrative 
minimally invasive medical device 10, such as a wire guide, for 
providing a radiation treatment in part of a body such as a passageway 
thereof. This minimally invasive medical device has particular 
application as a percutaneously inserted intravascular device for 
providing a radiation treatment to the area of a coronary vessel 
having, for example, a stent positioned therein. Device 10 comprises 
flexible elongated member 11 and radiation source 12. Flexible 
elongated member
