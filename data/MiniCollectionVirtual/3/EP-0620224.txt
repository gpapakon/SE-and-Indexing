<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel triazolopyridazine
derivatives, their intermediate products, production of
the derivatives and pharmaceutical preparations containing
the derivatives. The triazolopyridazine derivatives
of the present invention have excellent antiallergic,
anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet activating
factor (hereinafter referred to as PAF) actions, and
are useful as, for example, antiasthmatics by controlling
or inhibiting bronchospasm and bronchoconstriction.As an effective agent for a variety of diseases,
various triazolopyridazine compounds have been studied.

of the following formula:

wherein R and R3 respectively represent a hydrogen atom
or a lower alkyl group (at least one of R and R3 is a 
lower alkyl group), R1 and R2, taken together with the
nitrogen atom, represent a heterocyclic ring selected

morpholino or piperidino; and R2 represents a hydrogen
atom or a lower alkyl, with the proviso that at least
one of R and R2 is a group other than hydrogen atom and
with the further proviso that when R is phenyl, R1 is
