<ABSTRACT>
The gear (54) is of the friction type and is fitted adjustably in a peripheral direction on the housing (10). Through a dividing wall (36) it is sepd. from the space accommodating the rolled-up shutter (22). A bearer bush (34) rotatably locating the winding shaft (20) and holding the gear (54) non-rotatably is rotatably located in a hole in the dividing wall (36) and is firmly clampable by clamp components (46) on the dividing wall (36) by a friction force overcoming a specific torque. The clamp components are formed by a flange formed on the bearer bush and a clamp plate (46), between which the dividing wall is axially tensionable. The bearer bush and/or the clamp plate are of plastic, e.g. polyamide.

A hanging element, in particular a roller shutter, with 
a casing (10) and a winding shaft (20) mounted therein, 

which shaft can be driven by a mechanism (54) which is 
connected therewith in a torque-transmitting manner and 

which is fixed in frictional contact and adjustably in 
peripheral direction on the casing (10) and is separated 

from the chamber containing the rolled-up hanging element 
(22) by a dividing wall (36), characterised in that a 

carrier bush (34), in which the winding shaft (20) is 
rotatably mounted and which retains the mechanism (54) in a 

manner precluding relative rotation, is rotatably mounted in 
a bore of the separating wall (36) and can be clamped on the 

dividing wall (36) by clamping members (44, 46) with a 
frictional force to be overcome by a given torque. 
A hanging element according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the clamping members (44, 46) are formed by a flange 

(44) integrally formed on the carrier bush (34) and by a 
clamping disc (46), between which the separating wall (36) 

can be axially clamped. 
A hanging element according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the clamping disc (46) can be tightened by screws 

(48) disposed inside the bore in the separating wall (36) 
and engaging into the carrier bush (34). 
A hanging element according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the clamping disc (46) is 

retained on the carrier bush (34) in a manner precluding 
relative rotation. 
A hanging element according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the carrier bush (34) and/or  

 
the clamping disc (46) consist of plastics material, for 

example polyamide. 
A hanging element according to any one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that on one side edge the 

separating wall (36) is hooked to the casing (10, 18, 66) 
and on the opposite side edge is screwed to the casing 

(screws 40). 
A hanging element according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that with one or more eccentrically 

arranged, axially extending projections (60) the carrier 
bush (34) engages releasably into bores or recesses of the 

mechanism (54). 
A hanging element according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the end wall (66) of the casing (10) is provided 

on the side of the mechanism (54) with an opening (68), 
through which the mechanism (54) can slide axially out of 

the casing (10), whereupon it can be released from the 
projections (60) of the carrier bush (34) but by way of 

its drive shaft (58) remains in rotationally fixed and 
radially load-bearing connection with the armoured shaft 

(20, 28). 
A hanging element according to Claim 8, characterised 
in that the opening (68) can be closed by a detachable 

cover.
