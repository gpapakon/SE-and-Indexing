<ABSTRACT>
A plunger (21) movable in response to an input 
shaft (9) is slidably fitted in a hollow valve body (7) 

having a negative pressure passage (17) and a 
compressed air inlet port (19) through a pair of seal 

members (20
a
 and 20
b
). Two valves 27 and 28 are 
associated with the plunger to successively introduce 

the air and compressed air into a working pressure 
chamber (4) of a pneumatic booster so as to output 

boosted thrust. The bore (9
a
) of the valve body has 
a uniform diameter, and the inner surface of the bore 

is provided with an annular groove (45) including the 
compressed air inlet port (19). When the plunger (21) 

is inserted into the valve body (7), the leading seal 
member (20
a
) is prevented from coming in contact with 
the compressed air inlet port (19) by the presence of 

the annular groove (45) . There is no difference in 
pressure bearing area between the two end portions of 

the plunger (21), which are forward and rearward of the 
compressed air inlet port (19), when compressed air is 

introduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic booster used in a 
brake system of a vehicle or the like. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a pneumatic booster designed to output increased 
thrust force by introducing compressed air. A conventional pneumatic booster of the type described above has a 
housing, a diaphragm dividing the inside of the housing into a negative 
pressure chamber and a working pressure chamber, and a hollow valve 
body that is supported by the diaphragm. The valve body is provided 
with a compressed air inlet port. In addition, a plunger is accommodated 
in the bore of the valve body so as to be axially slidable in association 
with an input shaft. When force is applied to the input shaft, the plunger is moved 
forwardly, causing compressed air to be supplied to the working pressure 
chamber by the action of a valve device provided between the valve body 
and the plunger. Consequently, force is applied to the diaphragm, and 
thus booster action is obtained. The plunger has a pair of seal members which are fitted thereon on 
the opposite sides of the compressed air inlet port in order to maintain 
airtightness between the plunger and the inner wall of the valve body. 
Accordingly, the conventional pneumatic booster suffers from the problem 
that when the plunger with the seal members fitted thereon is inserted into 
the bore of the valve body, the leading seal member may be damaged by 
the edge of the compressed air inlet port.  
 A booster of this kind is known from the Japanese Patent public 
disclosure No. 6 255 471. The object of the present invention is to provide a pneumatic 
booster which is free from the above-described problem of the prior art. To this end, in accordance with a first aspect of the present 
invention we provide a pneumatic booster including: 
a housing,  a diaphragm dividing the inside of said housing into a negative 
pressure chamber and a working pressure chamber,  a hollow valve body supported by said diaphragm, said valve body 
having a negative pressure passage and a compressed air inlet port, a plunger slidably fitted in a bore of said valve body through at 
least a pair of seal members so as to move in response to the movement of 
an input shaft, said seal members being axially spaced from each other 
and disposed on the opposite sides of said compressed air inlet port, and a valve operable in response to the movement of said plunger to 
introduce compressed air into said working pressure chamber from said 
compressed air inlet

A pneumatic booster including: 

a housing (1), 
a diaphragm (2) dividing the inside of said housing into a negative 
pressure chamber (3) and a working pressure chamber (4), 
a hollow valve body (7) supported by said diaphragm (2), said 
valve body having a negative pressure passage (17) and a compressed air 

inlet port (19), 
a plunger (21) slidably fitted in a bore (9a) of said valve body 
through at least a pair of seal members (20a,20b) so as to move in 

response to the movement of an input shaft (22), said seal members being 
axially spaced from each other and disposed on the opposite sides of said 

compressed air inlet port (19), and 
a valve (28) operable in response to the movement of said plunger 
to introduce compressed air into said working pressure chamber (4) from 

said compressed air inlet port (19) so as to produce a differential pressure 
between said working pressure chamber (4) and said negative pressure 

chamber (3), thereby outputting boosted thrust through said valve 
body, (7),
 
   characterised in that the bore of said valve body has a uniform 

diameter over at least a portion thereof where said plunger slides; and a 
groove (45) is provided in an inner surface of the bore of said valve body 

(7), said groove including at least said compressed air inlet port (19). 
A pneumatic booster including: 

a housing (1), 
a diaphragm (2) dividing the inside of said housing into a negative 
pressure chamber and a working pressure chamber (4),  

 
a hollow valve body (7) supported by said diaphragm (2), said 
valve body (7) having a negative pressure passage (17) and a compressed 

air inlet port (19), 
a plunger (21) slidably fitted in a bore (9a) of said valve body 
through at least a pair of seal members (20a,20b) so as to move in

said compressed air inlet port (19) so as to produce a differential pressure 
between said working pressure chamber (4) and said negative pressure 

chamber (3), thereby outputting boosted thrust through said valve 
body (7),
 
   characterised in that said valve body (7) is arranged such that at 

least a portion of the bore (9a) where said plunger slides is composed of a 
front bore portion (46) having a relatively small diameter and a rear bore 

portion (47) having a relatively large diameter so that the border between 
said small-diameter bore portion and said large-diameter bore portion lies 

slightly forwardly of said compressed air inlet port (19); and 
a sleeve (49) is fitted into said large-diameter bore portion (47), 
said sleeve having an inner diameter equal to the diameter of said small-diameter 

bore portion, said sleeve further having a through-hole (50)
