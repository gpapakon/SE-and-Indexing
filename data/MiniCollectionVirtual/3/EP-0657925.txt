<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to formation and structures
for interlevel dielectrics in integrated circuit fabrication.A high degree of planarization is essential in the
fabrication of integrated circuits with multiple levels of
interconnect. Application of spin-on glass1, followed by global
etch-back, is widely used in the industry to achieve the desired
level of surface planarity. However, spin-on glass ("SOG") and
SOG etch-back technique are inadequate in a variety of situations
where topologies with high aspect ratio and/or more topologies
are encountered due to lack of planarization and/or SOG cracks.
(Spin-on glass deposition is an example of a "sol-gel" process, which has been
used in the semiconductor industry for many years. The unprocessed spin-on glass
material (available in numerous formulations) is a fluid material (actually a gel).
After the liquid material is coated onto the face of a wafer, the wafer is rotated at
high speed to throw off the excess material. The surface tension and adhesion of
the material provides a flat (planarized) surface with a controlled thickness. The
liquid material is then baked, to drive off solvents and provide a stable solid
silicate glass. See generally. e.g., Dauksher et al., "Three 'low Dt' options for
planarizing the pre-metal dielectric on an advanced double poly BiCMOS process,"
139 J.ELECTROCHEM.SOC. 532-6 (1992).) US 5,110,763 discloses the deposition of an organic glass
layer over an underlying structure having regions of high and low
relief. The regions of high relief are associated with
underlying wiring. The organic glass layer is partially removed
by overetching so that the areas of high relief of the underlying
structure are exposed. The organic glass layer remains as bulks
in the areas of low relief. A layer of silicon dioxide is then
deposited. A layer of inorganic glass is then deposited. The
inorganic glass is etched overall to expose portions of the layer
of silicon dioxide. An interlevel dielectric layer is deposited.
Vias are etched through the interlevel dielectric, the silicon
dioxide layer and the underlying structure to the metal wiring.
A metal layer is deposited to make connection to the underlying
metal wiring. In most cases, successful planarization of severe topologies
is achieved by a single or double SOG deposition+etchback step
in the following sequence:
a) a layer of dielectric is applied between the underlying
surface and SOG.b) application of a layer of SOG and SOG cure; c) application of a second layer of SOG and SOG cure
