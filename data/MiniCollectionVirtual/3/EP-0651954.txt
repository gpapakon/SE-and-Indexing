<ABSTRACT>
Fastening device for a sport shoe, which has a base part (1) which can be fastened on the sport shoe and in which a cable roller (6) is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to a rotary body (17) which has a toothing (21) which interacts with a blocking device (24, 27) on the base part (1). The rotary body is furthermore loaded with an axial spring (16) and can assume a starting position (A), a central position (B) and a free-wheeling position (C) by axial mobility. The base part (1) has an intermediate ring (12) supported on it which is coupled to the rotary body (17) via a locking piece (19) and a further toothing (14), which consists of n segments each with a coil-shaped sliding flank and a locking flank, in such a manner that the spring-loaded locking piece (19), by axial movement of the rotary body (17) against the axial spring (16) into the central position (B), moves first towards the axial spring (16) along a locking flank and then along a sliding flank to the next locking flank, as a result of which the rotary body (17) rotates by a given angle and returns axially into the starting position (A).

Clamping device for a sports shoe, in particular a ski boot, which device comprises a base

part (1) which can be attached to the sports shoe, in which base part a cable roller (6) for a
cable (45) is disposed connected in a non-rotatable manner to all axially displaceable rotational

body (17), wherein the rotational body comprising a handle (22, 38) is axially loaded by means
of an axial spring (16) and can assume an initial position (A) by means of this axial

displaceability, in which initial position toothing (21) on the rotational body (17) cooperates
with a blocking device (24, 27) on the base part (1) in order to prevent rotation against the

traction direction of the cable (45), and call assume a free running position (C) when pressure
is exerted on the handle (22, 38) against the force of the axial spring (16), in which free-running

position the blocking device (24, 27) is released from the toothing (21) and the
rotational body (17) can rotate freely in both directions, 
characterised in that,
 by means of a
locking piece (19) and further toothing (14), which consists of n segments with respective

slide edges (114', 214', ..., n14') formed helically in the axial direction and of radial locking
edges (114'', 214'', ..., n14''), an intermediate ring (12) supported on the base part (1) is

coupled to the rotational body (17) in such a way that by means of axial movement of the
rotational body (17) against the axial resilient force (16) into a middle position (B) between

the initial position (A) and the free-running position (C) the spring-loaded locking piece (19),
which lies against a locking edge (114''), first moves against the axial resilient force (16) along

this locking edge and, when traction is exerted on the cable, consequently, during
simultaneous movement in the direction of the axial resilient force (16), moves along the slide

edge (114') as far as the next locking edge (214''), whereby the rotational body rotates by a
specific angle and axially returns to the initial position (A).
