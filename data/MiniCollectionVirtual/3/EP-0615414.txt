<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic latch includes a first member (301) having a protrusion and a second member (305) engaging the protrusion to prevent the first member (301) and the second member (305) from sliding relatively to one another. The second member includes a first magnet (230) to attract the first member (301) and a first solid non-magnetic member (319a) located inside a cavity of the first magnet (230) to enhance attraction between the first member (301) and the second member (305). The second member (305) can be provided with a backing plate (315a) to facilitate a magnetic flux path from the magnet to the magnet aperture. The second member (305) can also include a second magent to attract the first member (301) and a second solid non-magnetic member located between the first magnet (230) and the second magnet. A third solid non-magnetic member can be provided on the outer periphery of the magnets. This design provides a latch with stronger holding power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a magnetic
latch. More specifically, the invention is directed
to a magnetic latch which is stronger and more
environmentally resistant than conventional magnetic
latches.Magnetic latches use magnetic force to hold
two objects together. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,021,891

3,372,443 issued to Daddona on March 12, 1968, and
No. 3,618,174 issued to Schainholz on November 9, 
1971 disclose examples of conventional magnetic
latches. U.S. Patent No. 2,884,698 issued to WÃ¼rsch
on May 5, 1959 discloses a magnetic holding device
for holding two pieces of metal together.The latching strength of these conventional
latches limits their utility. The latching strength
of these latches may be increased by increasing the
size of the latch. However, as the size of the
latch increases, the usefulness of the latch in many
applications decreases due to the bulkiness of the
latch. In addition, larger latches are more
expensive to manufacture, thereby reducing the cost
effectiveness of larger latches.Another disadvantage of these conventional
magnetic latches is their unsuitability for use in
a harsh environment. Generally, these conventional
latches contain numerous cracks and crevices which
collect caustic materials which corrode the latch
parts and degrade its effectiveness. In a salt-air
environment, the crevices in these conventional
latches collect salt and other corrosive materials
which ultimately corrode the latch parts. Thus,
using these conventional latches to hold sails in
place would be ineffective. Similar problems occur
when using magnetic latches in a caustic chemical
environment, for example, when using magnetic
latches to seal protective clothing. Even the
environment of a washing machine will cause most
prior art magnetic latches to rust, limiting their
usefulness on garments. Many of the potential applications for
magnetic latches require that the latch be resistive
to lateral force. Therefore, magnetic attachment
devices which do not resist lateral force, such as
the device disclosed in the '698 patent cited above,
are unsuitable for such applications.A magnetic latch according to the preamble of claim 1 is
known from JP 58-105508.It is an object of the invention, therefore,
to provide a magnetic

<CLAIMS>
A magnetic latch including

a first member (100, 301) made of magnetically attractable
material,
a second member (200, 305) having a magnet (230) with a
central throughhole and positioned to attract the magnetically

attractable material of said first member, and
means for preventing relative lateral movement between
said first and second members (100, 301; 200, 305),
characterised
 in that
said second member includes a magnetically insulating,
solid non-magnetic member (240, 319a) arranged inside said

hole and covering substantially the entire inner surface
thereof for enhancing magnetic attraction, and
at least one of said first and second members including
a projection (110, 222, 315b) extending at least partially

through said hole and separated from said magnet by said
solid non-magnetic member (240, 319a).
The magnetic latch of claim 1 including means (110, 130,
