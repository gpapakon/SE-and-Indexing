<ABSTRACT>
A color filter for a liquid crystal display includes an optically transparent support (100), a transparent conductor layer 
(500) formed on the support (100) and a coloring layer (200) formed on the transparent conductor layer (500) having red, green 

and blue pixels disposed in a predetermined pattern, wherein this coloring layer (200) has a specific dielectric constant of at least 

2.0 under a measurement condition in which an A.C. voltage of 5 V and a frequency of 1 KHz to 100 KHz is applied, and each 
pixel of red, green and blue constituting the coloring layer has a specific dielectric constant within the range of ± 25 % of the 

mean value under the measurement condition described above. The coloring layer (200) is 0.4 to 1.0 µm thick. This color filter can 
provide a liquid crystal display wherein the electro-optical characteristics of the pixels substantially coincide with one another, a 

sufficient effective voltage can be applied, though it uses an electrode under-fitting structure (COI structure), and color regulation 
can be satisfactorily made.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to colour filters employed in colour liquid crystal display apparatuses.A known method of colouring liquid crystal display devices is the employment of a display in
which a colour filter layer (colour layer) is disposed within a cell which has a pair of transparent
electrodes disposed in parallel. The known general compositions of colour filters are of the types
illustrated in Figure 4 and Figure 5, for example.The colour filter illustrated in Figure 4 includes a colour layer 200 upon a supporting member 100
which is composed of a transparent glass substrate, a film or the like. The colour layer 200
consists of picture elements of three colours, red (R), green (G), and blue (B), 200a, 200b, and
200c, which form a specified pattern (such as mosaic type, triangular type, striped type, etc.)
that corresponds to the area of the driven picture elements. A black matrix layer 300 is formed
between the picture elements 200a, 200b, and 200c. Moreover, a protective layer 400
consisting of transparent resin or the like is formed upon the colour layer 200, while a
transparent conductive layer 500 consisting of for example indium tin oxide (ITO) is formed upon
the protective layer 400. Colour filters formed in such manner are commonly combined with
substrates possessing thin film transistor (TFT) elements in order to form liquid crystal displays
for colour displays.Figure 5 illustrates the structure of a colour filter that is employed in a liquid crystal display
apparatus that employs the super-twisted nematic (STN) mode or alternatively the driver mode
with metal-insulator-metal (MIM) elements. Such colour filter has a similar structure to the
aforementioned colour filter, in a structure of a supporting member 100, a colour layer 200, a
black matrix layer 300, and a protective layer 400. The transparent conductive layer (ITO layer)
500 possesses a pattern which corresponds to the picture elements 200a, 200b, and 200c
which form the colour layer 200.As the embodiments of colour filters described in the foregoing are formed of transparent
conductive layers 500 upon colour layers 200, such embodiments are known as upper-ITO mode
or alternatively ITO on Colour Filter (IOC) mode.It is rather difficult to manufacture at low cost large-sized colour filters that employ such IOC
mode, and more particularly the type of colour filter illustrated in Figure 5, and which exceed 10 
inches diagonally. This is because of problems with the formation of the patterns in the ITO layer
which is formed upon the
