<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic material, and especially to a silver halide 
photographic material having excellent anti-curling 
properties and light-piping preventing properties. Since a polyester film has excellent producibility, 
mechanical strength and dimensional stability, it 
has heretofore been considered to be substitutable for 
TAC. However, when the polyester film is used as a 
support of a photographic material of the most popular 
roll film, it strongly curls and the curl of the film 
strongly remains even after development. As a result, the 
handling of the curled film is difficult and troublesome 
after development. Therefore, despite of the above-mentioned 
excellent properties, the use of the polyester 
film in the field of photographic materials has heretofore 
been limited. For reducing the curling property of a polyester 
film, JP-A-51-16358 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means 
an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") 
discloses a method in which a polyester film is heat-treated  
 
at a temperature lower than its glass transition 
temperature by 5°C to 30°C. Some kinds of a polyester film have a higher 
refractive index than that of TAC or PET, which causes 
light fogging due to so-called light piping. This problem 
has been required to be solved. On the other hand, the use of photographic 
materials is widely diversified in recent years, and the 
technology for rapid feeding in a camera or the like 
during picture-taking, elevation of image magnification, 
and reduction of the size of picture-taking devices has 
advanced noticeably. With this advanced technology, the 
support of photographic materials must have high strength 
and high dimensional stability and be as thin as possible. In addition, with the great reduction of the size 
of picture-taking devices, the demand for reducing the 
size of film-housing cartridges has also become great. 
TAC supports cannot satisfy the demand due to lack of the 
mechanical strength. Reduction of the size of a cartridge involves two 
problems. The first problem is that the reduction of the 
thickness of the film to be in the cartridge is 
accompanied by lowering of the mechanical strength of the 
film itself.  The second problem is that the film in a small-sized 
cartridge with a small-sized spool is strongly 
curled during storage of the film. For instance, if the 
exposed film taken out of such a small-sized cartridge is 
developed in a mini-laboratory automatic developing 
machine, the film
