<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus
for locating incipient faults in electric power distribution
cables.As discussed at length in U. S. Patent No. 4,887,041
granted December 12, 1989 to Matthew S. Mashikian, Robert B.
Northrop, Rajeev Bansal and Chrysostomos L. Nikias and
entitled "Method and Instrumentation for the Detection,
Location and Characterization of Partial Discharges and
Faults in Electric Power Cables", insulated underground
power cables are extensively used to distribute electrical
energy. Power cables which are used at elevated voltages,
basically consist of a central conductor surrounded by a
thin concentric layer of a semi-conducting material which is
referred to as a conductor shield, a concentric layer of
insulating material such as oil impregnated paper,
polyethylene, or other polymer, and a second concentric
semi-conducting layer referred to as an insulation shield,
and a metal conductor applied in the form of thin
helically wound concentric cylindrical wires or flat strips
which provide a ground or neutral. This assembly may be
covered by a thin electrically insulating jacket. Power
cables designed to operate below three thousand volts and
communication cables may omit semi-conducting shields and
neutrals.As discussed in the aforementioned patent, such
insulated cables are intended to operate safely and
effectively over lifespans exceeding thirty years. However, 
because of manufacturing defects, installation errors, or
aging under adverse conditions, cables may develop incipient
faults which are evidenced by a "partial discharge" (PD) at
the point of the incipient fault. Because of a defect
developing within or adjacent to the insulation of a cable,
intermittent arcing (partial discharge) occurs within the
insulation. As used herein, the term "incipient fault"
refers to a fault within the cable which will not cause
immediate failure but which may lead to eventual failure,
and the term "partial discharge" refers to the intermittent
arcing which will occur at such a point particularly when a
large excitation voltage is applied to the line. The energy
involved in this partial discharge is extremely small, and,
depending upon the type of insulating material, localized
deterioration of the material occurs. Eventually, such
incipient faults will produce a complete breakdown of the
cable. Should this occur during a critical period, such as
during a period of peak demand, there can be considerable
customer inconvenience.The location of faults in power lines has been the
