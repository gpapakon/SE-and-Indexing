<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a method for repositioning the casting system in a moulding and conveying system, the deviation between the position of the bottom hole of a casting system and the position of the gate of a casting mould being determined and, after a pouring operation has been carried out, the position at the casting system being altered in accordance with this deviation if the said deviation exceeds a tolerance value. The deviation between the position of the casting system and that of the gate is determined during casting by a procedure in which a measuring zone (16) is defined in such a way in a video image (12) used to determine the liquid metal level in the gate for the purpose of controlling the said level that, if the casting system is correctly positioned above a gate, the ratio of the visible surface area (C) of the mould within the measuring zone to the visible surface area (D) of the liquid metal within the measuring zone corresponds to a specifiable factor. Deviations in the area ratios from the specifiable factor which are detected in renewed measurements are used as a measure of the deviation between the position of the casting system and the position of the gate.

Method of repositioning a pouring system in a
bale-pressing moulding and conveying system, the

deviation between the position of the bottom hole of a
pouring system and the position of the sprue of a

casting mould being determined during the pouring, and,
after pouring-off is effected, the position of the

pouring system being changed in accordance with this
deviation if the deviation exceeds a tolerance value,

characterized in that, in a video image (12) which
serves to determine the liquid-metal height in the sprue

for regulating the pouring level, a measuring zone (16)
is defined in such a way that, when a pouring system is

correctly positioned above a sprue, the area ratio

between the visible mould-bale surface (C) inside the
measuring zone and the visible liquid-metal surface (D)

inside the measuring zone corresponds to a
predeterminable factor, and by [sic]
 deviations of the
area ratios from the predeterminable factor, which

deviations are detected during renewed measurements, are
used as a measure of the deviation between pouring-system

position and sprue position, the width (a) of the
measuring zone (16) being narrower than the width (b) of

the pouring stream (15), in that the result is fed to a
control system, consisting of a histogram analysis (8)

for the measuring zone, an area evaluation (9), a
measured-value weighting (10) and a position calculation

(11) for the coordinate setpoint input to the
positioning system (5a), in which arrangement the

distribution of the mould-bale surface (C) and/or of the
liquid-metal surface (D) inside the measuring zone (16)

is checked by means of the histogram analysis (8) in
order to determine any contamination of the mould-bale

surface and/or of the liquid-metal surface, and, for the
positioning of the pouring system, it is not just the

individual measurement which is current at any instant
that is taken into account, but rather, with the use of

the measured-value weighting 110), both the current
measurement and a plurality of previous measurements 

with the same or different weighting are taken into
account.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the coordinates for the repositioning are

determined by means of correlations determined off-line
between deviations of the area ratio between mould-bale

surface (C) and liquid-metal surface (D) inside the
measuring zone (16) and a deviation between pouring-system

position and sprue position.
