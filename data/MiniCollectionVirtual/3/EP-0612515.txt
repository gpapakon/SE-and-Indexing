<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, the method for mixing a gas with at least one liquid, especially for obtaining an unchlorinated or weakly chlorinated solvent from a gaseous hydrofluoroalkane, is characterised in that it consists, starting from standard temperature and pressure conditions, in cooling the gas in the temperature and pressure conditions such that this gas liquifies, in mixing this liquified gas with the said liquid, and in returning the mixture to standard temperature.
