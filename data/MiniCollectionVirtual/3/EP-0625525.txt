<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of highly active 
catalysts for olefin polymerization, in which essentially 


a) organometallic compounds of the formula (RCH
2
)
4
M, in 
which R is an aryl, aralkyl, tertiary alkyl or 

trialkylsilyl radical, wherein the RCH
2
 group has no 
H bonded to an atom in the beta-position relative to 

M, and M represents Ti, Zr or Hf, are reacted with 
b) metal oxides from group IIa, IIIa, IVa or IVb having 
a partly hydroxylated surface or mixtures thereof, 
 
in a hydrocarbon as the reaction medium, characterized in 

that the by-products formed in the reaction are removed 
completely or partly from the resulting catalyst by 

washing them out, using for example a liquid, inert 
hydrocarbon such as that employed as the reaction medium, 

or by mechanical separation techniques, for example by 
filtration, centrifugation or decanting together with the 

reaction medium, or by evaporation, preferably under 
vacuum, or by a combination of these measures. 
Process for the preparation of catalysts according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that the organometallic 

compound of the formula (RCH
2
)
4
M is recrystallized from a 
liquid hydrocarbon before the reaction with the metal 

oxide. 
Process for the preparation of polyolefins by 
catalytic homo- or copolymerization of olefins, characterized 

in that catalysts which can be prepared according 
to one of Claims 1 or 2 are used in the polymerization. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that propylene, if appropriate with ethylene as a comonomer, 

is employed as the olefin.
