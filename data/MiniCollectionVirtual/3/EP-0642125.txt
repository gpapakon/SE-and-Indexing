<ABSTRACT>
Magneto-optical recording medium comprising a substrate and a recording 
multilayer, the recording multilayer having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and 

comprising layers of a first kind, which are principally comprised of Co, alternately 
stacked with layers of a second kind, which comprise metal other than Co, successive 

layers of the first kind being ferromagnetically coupled across interposed layers of the 
second kind, whereby at least one of the layers of the second kind which is bounded on 

both sides by layers of the first kind is substituted by a coupling structure comprising at 
least one layer of antiferromagnetic coupling material, across which coupling structure 

the immediately adjacent layers of the first kind are antiferromagnetically coupled. Such 
a magneto-optical recording medium is suitable for super-resolution data storage and 

retrieval, and for a direct overwrite procedure which does not involve magnetic field 
modulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magneto-optical recording medium comprising a
substrate and a recording multilayer, the recording multilayer having a magnetic easy axis
perpendicular to the multilayer and comprising layers of a first kind alternately stacked with
layers of a second kind, the layers of the first kind being substantially comprising Co and the
layers of the second kind comprising a metal other than Co, whereby successive layers of the
first kind are ferromagnetically coupled across interposed layers of the second kind, that at
least one of the layers of the second kind which is bounded on both sides by layers of the first
kind being substituted by a coupling structure comprising at least one layer of
antiferromagnetic coupling material, across which coupling structure the immediately adjacent
layers of the first kind are antiferromagnetically coupled.In a magneto-optical recording medium having a recording multilayer with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, individual data bits are represented by domains which are
magnetised in one of the two different orientations perpendicular to the multilayer. Such data
bits can be detected via magneto-optical effects, whereby the polarisation state of polarised
light incident on the multilayer (e.g. from a laser) is changed in a manner which depends on
the direction and magnitude of the magnetisation in that part of the multilayer impinged upon
by the light. Such changes in polarisation state can be monitored in the light reflected from the
multilayer (Kerr effect) or in the light transmitted through the multilayer (Faraday effect).The magnetised domains can be obtained by using a focused laser light beam to
locally heat the recording multilayer to a temperature near the Curie temperature of the
recording multilayer material. When the region of the recording multilayer thus heated is
allowed to cool in an external magnetic field, the magnetisation in that region will align and
lodge itself in the direction of that magnetic field. This procedure is referred to as
thermomagnetic writing. A common means of thermomagnetically writing information in a
recording multilayer is one whereby the recording medium is embodied in the form of a disc
which rotates about an axis perpendicular to its plane, the data bits being written in the
recording multilayer using a permanent external magnetic field and a radially moveable
focused laser light beam whose intensity is pulsed in accordance with the information to be 
written. Use of this means necessitates prior erasure of

Magneto-optical recording medium (1) comprising a substrate (11) and a
recording multilayer (3), the recording multilayer (3) having a magnetic easy axis

perpendicular to the multilayer (3) and comprising layers of a first kind (5) alternately stacked
with layers of a second kind (7), the layers of the first kind (5) substantially comprising Co

and the layers of the second kind (7) comprising a metal other than Co, whereby successive
layers of the first kind (5) are ferromagnetically coupled across interposed layers of the second

kind (7), at least one of the layers of the second kind (7) which is bounded on both sides by
layers of the first kind (5) being substituted by a coupling structure comprising at least one

layer (9) of antiferromagnetic coupling material, across which coupling structure the
immediately adjacent layers of the first kind kind (5) are antiferromagnetically coupled,

characterized in that the embodiment of that part P1 of the recording multilayer (3) at one side
of the coupling structure and of that part P2 of the recording multilayer (3) at the other side of

the coupling structure is such that a first magnetic switching field being applied under thermally weakened antiferromagnetic coupling, for switching
magnetisations in part P1 out of anti-parallel orientation with respect to corresponding

magnetisations in part P2 and into parallel orientation with respect thereto, is smaller than a
second magnetic switching field, for switching magnetisations in part P2 out of anti-parallel

orientation with respect to corresponding magnetisations in part P1 and into parallel
orientation with respect thereto.
Magneto-optical recording medium (1) according to claim 1, characterized in
that part P1 and part P2 of the recording medium (1) are thus embodied that a third magnetic

switching field, for switching magnetisations in part P1 out of parallel orientation with respect
to corresponding magnetisations in part P2 and into anti-parallel orientation with respect

thereto, is negative.
Magneto-optical recording medium (1) according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the Curie temperature of part P1 is larger than the Curie temperature of part P2. 
Magneto-optical recording medium (1) according to any of the preceeding
claims, characterized in that the antiferromagnetic coupling material is selected from the group

formed by V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and mixtures thereof.
Magneto-optical recording medium (1) according to claim 4, characterized in
that the coupling structure is a single layer (9) of antiferromagnetic coupling material selected

from the group formed by Rh, Ru, and mixtures thereof, which layer (9) has a thickness in the
range 0,5 nm - 1,2 nm.
Magneto-optical recording medium (1) according to any of the preceeding
claims, characterized in that the coupling structure contains at least one layer of ferromagnetic

material selected from the group formed by Fe, Ni, Co, and mixtures thereof.
Magneto-optical recording medium according to any of the preceeding claims,
characterized in that the layers of the second kind (7) contain a material selected from the

group formed by Ni, Pd, Pt, Au, and mixtures thereof.
A method of reading data bits from a magneto-optical recording medium as
claimed in any of the claims 1-7, characterized in that a focussed light beam is used to

sufficiently thermally weaken the antiferromagnetic coupling within a given data bit domain to
an extent whereby an external magnetic field can be, and is, subsequently used to force the

magnetisation within that data bit domain and at one given side of the coupling structure into a
certain orientation, without changing the orientation of the magnetisation within that data bit

domain and at the other side of the coupling structure, whereby the intensity of the light beam
is thus chosen that the said sufficient thermal weakening of the antiferromagnetic coupling

only occurs within an area of the focused light beam which is smaller than the Airy disc of the
light beam, the configuration of magnetisations in the given data bit domain being derived

from analysis of the magneto-optical Kerr effect observed in the light reflected therefrom.
A method of directly writing data bits into a magneto-optical recording medium
as claimed in any of the claims 1-7, characterized in that a first external magnetic field is

employed fo force all magnetisations in a given region of the recording multilayer and at a
first side of the coupling structure into a single orientation without disturbing the

magnetisations in that same region of the recording multilayer but at the other side of the 
coupling structure, and a second external magnetic field is subsequently used in conjunction

with a focused light beam to thermomagnetically write new data bits into that same
region of the recording multilayer, the direction of the second extemal magnetic field being

opposite to that of the first external magnetic field, whereby a first light intensity required to
reverse the magnetisation direction solely at the second side of the coupling structure in a

given data bit domain of the given region is lower than a second light intensity required to reverse the
magnetisation direction at the first side of the coupling structure in a given data bit domain of

that region, the intensity of the light beam being modulated in accordance with the information
content of the data bits to be written, whereby the value of the light intensity for each such data

bit is equal to either the first light intensity or the second light intensity.
