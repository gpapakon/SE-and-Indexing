<ABSTRACT>
A control system for a working apparatus such as a derailleur or 
self-contained 

change speed apparatus of a bicycle, operable by a pulling force and a 
restoring 

force. This control system comprises a first sleeve (120) shiftable in 
one direction by 

the pulling force, and in the other direction by the restoring force; 
a second 

sleeve (130) for transmitting a shift of the first sleeve (120) to a 
controlled member of the 

change speed apparatus to control the controlled member, the first 
sleeve (120) and 

the second sleeve (130) being interlocked to be shiftable relative to 
each other; a 

clutch pawl (180) switchable between a first position to transmit 
rotational drive of 

the bicycle to the second sleeve (130), and a second position to break 
drive transmission; 

and a clutch controller (160) for switching the clutch pawl (180) to 
the first position in 

response to a relative shift between the first sleeve (120) and the 
second sleeve (130).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control system for controlling a working
apparatus, particularly a change speed apparatus, for use on a bicycle, which
control system is reciprocally operable by a pulling force and a restoring force.As a known type of change speed apparatus for a bicycle, a self-contained
change speed apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,273,500, for example.
This change speed apparatus has a fixed shaft rotatably supporting a drive
member and a hub body, and a drive transmitting mechanism for transmitting
torque from the drive member to the hub body in varied speeds. The drive
transmitting mechanism includes four sun gears rotatably mounted on the fixed
shaft, a pair of planet gears meshed with each sun gear, a clutch mechanism for
transmitting torque from the drive member to a carrier of one pair of planet
gears, transmission pawls for transmitting torque from a ring gear meshed with
the other pair of planet gears to the hub body, and transmission pawls for
transmitting torque from a carrier supporting the other pair of planet gears to the
hub body.The fixed shaft further supports a shifter sleeve mounted thereon to be
rotatable in opposite directions. The shifter sleeve is rotatable in one direction
by a pulling force exerted through a control cable, and in the other direction by
a force of a return spring. The shifter sleeve defines control sections for engaging
and disengaging the clutch mechanism and for locking and unlocking the four
sun gears. Each sun gear has sun pawls engageable with projections formed on 
the fixed shaft. The control sections of the shifter sleeve cause the sun pawls to
engage the projections, thereby to lock the sun gears, or to mount the projections,
thereby to unlock and allow rotation of the sun gears. In this way, the self-contained
speed change apparatus transmits torque from the drive member to the hub
body in seven, a first to a seventh, speed stages.A relatively strong operating force is required to switch the sun pawls from a
lock position to an unlock position since the sun pawls must be disengaged
from the projections on the fixed shaft. A strong shifting force is required
particularly when a large driving load is applied during a run, for example, to
maintain the sun pawls rigidly engaged with the projections on the fixed shaft.
In conventional practice, therefore, a relatively strong return spring is used to
realize a smooth shifting operation based on the force of the return spring
against the rigid engagement between the sun pawls

A control system for a working apparatus of a bicycle, operable by a pulling
force and a restoring force, said control system comprises:


a first shift member (38, 120) shiftable in one direction by said pulling force
of a control cable (6), and in the other direction by said restoring force of a

return spring (32);
a second shift member (50, 130) for transmitting a shift of said first shift
member (38, 120) to a controlled member of said working apparatus to

control said controlled member, said first shift member (38, 120) and said
second shift member (50, 130) being interlocked to be shiftable relative to

each other;
characterized by
clutch means (36, 180) switchable between a first position to transmit
rotational drive of said bicycle as a restoring force to said second shift

member (50, 130), and a second position to break drive transmission; and
clutch control means (38a, 162) for switching said clutch means (36, 180) to
said first position in response to a relative shift between said first shift

member (38, 120) and said second shift member (50, 130).
A control system as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said clutch
means (36, 180) includes a clutch pawl (36, 180) engageable in said first

position with a drive member (1) of said bicycle to be rotatable together, and
disengageable therefrom in said second position, said clutch control means

(38a, 180) having a configuration to convert said relative shift between said
first shift member (38, 120) and said second shift member (50, 130) into a

shift for switching said clutch pawl (36, 180) to said first position. 
A control system as defined in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said working
apparatus is a self-contained change speed apparatus, said clutch means (36)

and said clutch control means (38a) being arranged outwardly of a drive
