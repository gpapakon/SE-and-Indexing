<ABSTRACT>
A rotary article storage and outfeed apparatus (10) 
stores a plurality of groups (31) of generally flat articles 

in a facewise stacked condition and delivers a supply of these 
articles to an infeed for a device wherein the articles are to 

be utilized. The apparatus (10) comprises an upper rotary 
carousel (40) rotatable about an upper axis (44) and a lower 

rotary carousel (42) located below the upper carousel (40) and 
rotatable about a lower axis (46) parallel to and offset from 

the upper axis. Each of the carousels (42,44) has a plurality 
of circumferentially spaced vertically oriented pockets 

(50,52), each pocket being dimensioned for receiving a group 
(31) of articles in a facewise stacked condition. A frame 

(60) mounts the upper and lower carousels (40,42) so that an 
upper end of the pockets (52) of the lower carousel (42) is 

spaced below a lower end of the pockets (50) of the upper 
carousel (40), and so that the upper and lower axes (46,44) 

are offset in such a way that one of the pockets (52) of the 

lower carousel (42) coaxially aligns with one of the pockets 
(50) of the upper carousel (40) at one position in the 

respective rotations thereof to define an article transfer 
position (62). An article transfer device (70) is provided 

for transferring a group (31) of articles between the pockets 
of the respective carousels (40,42) which are aligned and 

located in the transfer position (62).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to article storage and 
feeding apparatus for providing a supply of articles to article 
utilization equipment, and more particularly to a novel and 
improved rotary article storage and outfeed apparatus for storing 
a supply of articles such as collapsed or folded cartons or 
carton blanks and feeding the articles on demand to utilization 
equipment. Modern consumer products processing and filling 
equipment operates at relatively high rates of speed to attain 
economical production costs in the filling process. In order to 
maintain these relatively high speeds, the filling equipment must 
be provided with a reliable and continuous supply of cartons or 
packages to be filled. Specialized equipment sometimes called 
feeding or infeeding equipment has been devised to meet this 
need.  
 One particularly successful type of infeed device is 
a so-called carousel-type feeder, such as those described and 
claimed for use with can ends in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,722,741 and 
4,000,709. A similar carousel-type feeder for carton blanks is 
also described in U.S. Patent No. 4,592,462. All of the above-noted 
U.S. Patents are commonly owned herewith. Similar requirements and problems are encountered in 
processing relatively flat, thin articles such as collapsed or 
folded cartons or carton blanks or so-called out-serts, which are 
generally folded printed materials such as instructions, coupons, 
advertising materials or the like which are packaged with 
products, often on the exterior of the packaging, to be held by 
shrink wrap or the like. Hence, the name out-serts, rather than 
the more familiar inserts which would be physically inserted 
within the package or other container. The equipment of the 
above-referenced patents, as well as the present invention, can 
also be adapted to handle a wide variety of stackable products 
or parts, such as metal, plastic or paperboard lids, tubs, 
stampings or box flats. The use of such carousel feed units with carton blanks 
or out-serts require somewhat more careful handling than in the 
case of metal parts such as can ends. For example, it is 
important to avoid damage, bending or fraying of the edges of 
these paper or cardboard products. The handling often involves 
transfer from an outfeed or supply pocket or chamber of the 
carousel feeding apparatus to a receiving pocket or chamber or 
other intake device of a supply means for subsequent processing 
equipment. In U.S. Patent 5,096,371, which is commonly owned 
herewith, there is

<CLAIMS>
Article storage and outfeed apparatus for a 
plurality of groups of generally flat articles in face-wise 

stacked condition and for delivering a supply of said articles 
from said apparatus to an infeed or the like for a device 

wherein said articles are to be utilized, said apparatus 
comprising a lower group of vertically oriented, spaced pockets 

(52) movable about a fixed closed path; each of said pockets 
(52) being dimensioned for receiving a stack (31) of said 

articles in face-wise stacked condition and further comprising 
an article transfer means (70); characterised in that an 

upper group of vertically oriented, spaced pockets (50) is 
movable along a fixed closed path; 

each of said pockets (50) is also dimensioned for receiving a 
stack (31) of said articles in face-wise stacked condition; 

said upper and lower 
groups of pockets (50,52) are offset in such a way that the 

paths of movement of said upper and lower groups of pockets 
(50,52) overlap at least at one location to define a transfer 

position (62), such that one of said pockets of said lower 
group will be aligned coaxially with one of the pockets of 

said upper group at said transfer position (62), with the 
upper ends of the pockets (52) of said lower group being 

spaced below the lower ends of the pockets (50) of said upper 
group at said transfer position (62); and in that said 

article transfer means (70) is associated with said transfer 
position (62) for transferring a stack (31) of articles from 

said coaxially aligned pocket (50) of said lower group to said
