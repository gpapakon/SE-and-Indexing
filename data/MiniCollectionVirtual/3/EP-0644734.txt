<ABSTRACT>
Assembly for suspending objects such as paintings, pictures and the like on a rail, a panel edge or something of the kind, intended for being arranged in a substantially horizontal way, comprising a vertical wire (14), a hook (3), which comprises an upper hook-shaped portion (4, 5, 6) and allower hook-shaped portion (6, 7, 8), as well as an anchoring block (9), which is provided with a passage (12) for holding the wire (14) therein, in which the upper hook-shaped portion is formed to be able to be hooked to the rail, panel edge or the like and the lower hook-shaped portion comprises a hole (10) bounded all around for leading through the wire (14) and supporting means (7) for supporting the anchoring block such that the portion of the elongated member that is located in the receiving space is aligned with the portion of the elongated member located below there.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an assembly as described in the preamble 
of claim 1. Furthermore, the invention relates to a hook as described 
in the preamble of claim 6. An assembly for suspending objects such as prints 
is known among others from 
EP-A-0183325. In EP-A-0183325 a suspension system is disclosed, 
comprising an upper and a lower block-shaped hook, the 
upper block hook being substantially inverted U-shaped so 
as to be hooked with the thus formed channel or groove to 
an upright wall portion of a suspension rail or the upper 
edge of a panel. The block-shaped hook is further provided 
with a vertical passage for a wire, as well as with a 
further passage extending perpendicularly to that passage, 
which is provided with a screw thread and in which a 
socket screw can be screwed to secure the wire in its 
position in the passage. An assembly and a hook of the kind described in the preambles 
of claims 1 and 6 are known from DE-U-7917482. This known assembly 
comprises 
upper and lower, substantially C-shaped hooks, whereby 
the upper hook can be hooked to a suspension rail and the 
lower hook, which is connected to the upper hook by means 
of a wire, can be hooked to the object. The C-shaped hooks 
are provided with open grooves through which the wire can  
 
extend. At its lower end and at its upper end the wire is 
provided with anchoring blocks of a dimension such that 
they cannot move through the above mentioned grooves and 
can thus secure the wire relative to the respective hooks. 
In order to more or less fix the position of the anchoring 
blocks with respect to the C-shaped hooks, the legs of the 
C-shaped hooks which are provided with grooves are V-shaped 
so that the anchoring blocks can be accommodated 
therein in an inclined way. The cube-shaped anchoring 
blocks will here assume such a position that their lower 
and upper face, respectively, will end up being positioned 
at an angle of approximately 45° with the horizontal. At 
the position of exit from the block the wire, which extends 
through the blocks and is secured therein with the 
help of a screw, will undergo a change of direction of 45° 
and will rest there against the opening edge of the passage 
in the block. Here there is a danger that in the course 
of time the wire will be cut there, possibly resulting in 
failure of the wire, the further consequence being that 
the object falls down. It is an object of the invention to provide an assembly of 
the type named in the preamble, whereby the elongated 
member is at

<CLAIMS>
Assembly for suspending objects such as paintings, 
pictures and the like on a rail, a panel edge or the like, 

intended for being arranged in a substantially horizontal 
way, the assembly comprising an elongated member (14) 

intended to extend in a substantially vertical direction 
between the rail, the panel edge or the like and the 

object, a hook (3) comprising an upper hook-shaped portion 
(4, 5, 6) being formed so as to be hooked onto the rail, 

the panel edge or the like, the hook (3) further comprising 
a lower hook-shaped portion (6, 7, 8) being formed so 

as to support an anchoring block (9), the anchoring 
block (9) being provided with a receiving space (12) for 

holding the elongated member (14) therein, 
characterized 
in that
 the lower hook-shaped portion (6, 7, 8) of the 

hook (3) comprises a hole (10) being bounded all around 
for leading through the elongated member (14), and in that 

the lower hook-shaped portion (6, 7, 8) is specifically 
designed to support the anchoring block (9) such that the 

portion of the elongated member (14) which is located in 
the receiving space (12) is linearly aligned with the 

portion of the elongated member (14) which is located 
below the receiving space (12). 
Assembly according to claim 1, in which the lower hook-shaped 
portion (6, 7, 8) is substantially U-shaped and the 

support means are formed by the base (7) thereof. 
Assembly according to claim 2, in which the lower hook-shaped 
portion (6, 7, 8) is U-formed with right-angled 

corners, the anchoring block having a substantially 
straight parallelepiped form. 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, 
in which the anchoring block (9) is fittingly accomodated  

 
in the lower hook-shaped portion (6, 7, 8). 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, 
in which at least in the area adjacent the exit opening of 

the receiving space (12) the anchoring block (9) is complementarily 
formed to the area adjacent the hole (10) of 

the lower hook-shaped portion. 
Hook (3) for suspending objects such as paintings, 
pictures and the like on a rail, a panel edge or the like, 

intended for being arranged in a substantially horizontal 
way, the hook (3) comprising an upper hook-shaped portion 

(4, 5, 6) being formed so as to be hooked onto the rail, 
the panel edge or the like, the hook (3) further comprising 

a lower hook-shaped portion (6, 7, 8), 
characterized 
in that
 the lower hook-shaped portion (6, 7, 8) comprises 
a hole (10) being bounded all around and is substantially 

U-shaped while support means are formed by the base 
(7) thereof. 
Hook according to claim 6, in which the lower hook-shaped 
portion (6, 7, 8) is U-formed with right-angled 

corners.
