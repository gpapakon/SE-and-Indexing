<ABSTRACT>
A device for crushing and cooling material leaving a burning oven (4) has a crusher (6) arranged in the high temperature area, preferably immediately after the oven and before the cooler (1) in the path followed by the materials. The crusher (6) has several cantilevered roll-shaped crushing elements (7) which project from outside into the path of the materials and may be retracted for servicing purposes.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for crushing and cooling of material passing out of a firing oven (4)
where the crusher (6) is arranged preferably in the hot area directly behind the oven

in the material path in front of the cooler (1) and only protrudes into a part of the
cross section of the cooler inlet duct, whereas the other part is open for the cooling

air flow from the cooler (1) to the oven (4), characterized by a crusher equipped with
roller-type crushing elements (7) reaching into the material path (5) and being

withdrawable from the material path due to the overhung mounting on movable
bearing units (11).
Arrangement acc. to claim 1, characterized in that the bearing units (11) and the
corresponding crushing elements (7) can be moved individually in longitudinal

direction.
Arrangement acc. to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the inclination (16) of the
crushing elements (7) can be adjusted relative to the horizontal position, preferably

during operation.
Arrangement acc. to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the crushing elements
(7) can be fixed in different longitudial adjustments.
Arrangement acc. to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that when using a rotary
tube kiln (4), a larger number of crushing elements (7) is arranged on the that side of

the cooler inlet duct (5) where the oversized grains mainly accumulate.
Arrangement acc. to one of clams 1 to 5, characterized in that the speed of the
crushing elements (7) is mainly below 30 min
-1
.
Arrangement acc. to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the speed of the
crushing elements can be adjusted independently for each individual element, if

required.
Arrangement acc. to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the direction of
rotation of the crushing elements (7) is adjustable.
Arrangement acc. to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that one or more
crushing elements is / are adjustable in transverse direction
