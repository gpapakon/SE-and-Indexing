<ABSTRACT>
Each station is linked to the ring network (5) through station and ring interface units, the second of these units is equipped with a switch (37) for putting the station in communication with the ring (5) for transmitting signals which it receives in digital form, either from this ring, or from the station via the associated station interface unit. The data signal received from a station, timed by an oscillator of this station, is transcoded in the associated ring interface unit before being recoded into its original form at the rate fixed by an oscillator (12) which is common to the stations of the device and which is slaved to the oscillator of one of the stations regarded as master.
