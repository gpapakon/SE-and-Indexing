<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on a high-voltage switching device for a gas-insulated switching installation having a gas-filled metal housing and having a current path which is kept in said housing and has at least two series-connected switching points (2,3) whose moving contact pieces (5,8) are operated by a common drive (14) which is mounted on the metal housing. It is intended to produce a high-voltage switching device which occupies less space both when installed horizontally and when installed vertically. This is achieved in that the current path forms an angle ( alpha ), at least one of the at least two switching points (2,3) in each case being arranged on each limb of the angle ( alpha ). The centre section of the metal housing has a further opening (16) which is provided for the attachment of a resistor housing (17) which encloses a connection resistor (18) together with auxiliary switching points.

High-voltage switching device for metal-encapsulated
gas-insulated switchgear, having a gas-filled metal

housing which has a middle section, and having a conducting
path which is he
ld in said metal housing and has at
least two series-connected switching points (2,3) whose

movable contact pieces (5, 8) are actuated by a common
drive (14) mounted at a first opening (13) of the middle

section of the metal housing, the conducting path forming
an angle (α), and there being respectively arranged on

each leg of the angle (α) at least one of the at least
two switching points (2, 3), each of which is surrounded

by a tubular housing section attached to the middle
section, and the middle section having a second opening

(16), which is provided for attaching a resistance
housing (17) which surrounds a closing resistor (18),

which is operationally connected to the switching points
(2, 3) during closure, and auxiliary switching points

required for connecting and disconnecting said closing
resistor, characterized


in that the angle (α) is constructed as a right angle.
High-voltage switching device according to Claim
1, characterized


in that the longitudinal axes (6, 9) of the tubular
housing sections extend parallel to the axis of the

respective leg.
High-voltage switching device according to one of
Claims 1 or 2, characterized


in that the vertex of the angle (a) is situated inside
the middle section.
High-voltage switching device according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized


in that the middle section is constructed as a corner
housing (12) having connecting flanges by means of which

the tubular housing sections are connected in a pressure-tight
fashion.
