<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to communication receivers, and more 
particularly to intermediate frequency (IF) to baseband frequency signal converters for 
use in communication receivers. Recent advances in digital VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology 
have been employed in communication receivers to achieve increased processing power 
and decreased power consumption. As will be appreciated, high processing power, low 
power consumption receivers are necessary to efficiently and effectively implement 
many types of communication systems, such as cellular telephone systems. Conventional radio communication receivers and, specifically, the IF-to-baseband 
signal converters used therein employ analog-to-digital (A/D) converters to 
convert a received analog signal to a digital signal. Unfortunately, low-lost, low-power 
analog-to-digital signal conversion technology has benefited slowly from the advances 
in digital VLSI technology. This is the case, since mixed-signal CMOS and BiCMOS 
techniques do not allow for low-power analog signal conversion at low cost. Thus, the 
A/D converters and the associated analog I/Q (in-phase/quadrature) mixers which are 
employed in conventional communication receivers increase power consumption, 
complicate the design process (since analog designs are generally harder to test than 
digital designs), and increase production costs (since analog components must be tuned 
and/or matched). Thus, what is required is an all digital IF-to-baseband signal converter which 
does not employ analog-to-digital (A/D) converters or other associated analog circuitry. The present invention is directed to an intermediate frequency (IF) to baseband 
frequency signal converter for decoding an analog IF signal using phase information  
 
contained in the IF signal. The signal converter includes first means for generating an 
analog square wave signal from the IF signal, second means for generating a local 
phase reference signal, and third means, coupled to the first means and the second 
means, for determining at a particular sampling interval a phase difference between a 
phase of the analog square wave signal and a phase of the local phase reference signal, 
wherein the phase difference represents a symbol which the signal converter has 
decoded from the IF signal. Further features and advantages of the present invention, as well as the 
structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention, are described 
in detail below with reference to the
