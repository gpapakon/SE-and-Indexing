<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a suspension frame for a false 
ceiling comprising main profiles (1), that in cross-section 

substantially have the form of an inverted T or a 
twofold T, with a body (2) and at least at the bottom two 

laterally veering flanges (3) and cross-profiles (5,6,7) cooperating 
therewith. The body (2) of said 

cross-profiles (5,6,7) is extended at each extremity 
further than the flanges (3) pertaining thereto, and 

bent at an angle, while the main profile (1) comprises 
grooves (4) to lodge the extremities of the cross-profiles (5,6,7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a suspension frame
for a false ceiling comprising main profiles that in
cross-section have substantially the form of an inverted
T, or a twofold T, in other words, a profile with a body
and, in working position, at least at the bottom side
two laterally veering flanges and cross-profiles with
an analogous cross-section cooperating therewith.False ceilings that use main profiles that
intersect cross-profiles at an angle of 90° are known.
The voids between said profiles are finished off with
square, often rectangular panels. The originated pattern
is thus always orthogonal. The realisation of ceilings
differing from one of said orthogonal patterns is then,
for technical and economical reasons, not or very
difficultly feasible.A structure for a false ceiling that
exclusively allows the realisation of an orthogonal
structure is known from the U.S. patent 3,292,332. On
the other hand, a profile enabling to realise checkered
grids is known from the document AT 316081, but the
pattern can never deviate from the originally
established shape.The object of the invention is now to realise
a suspension frame for such ceilings that enables to
install cross-profiles at any angle in regard to the
main profiles, so as to be able to use rectangular,
gridded or trapezoidal shaped panels or combination
thereof in the finishing of the ceiling too.To render this possible according to the invention,
the body of said cross-profile is extended at each 
extremity further than the flanges pertaining thereto
and bent over an angle, while the main profile, in the
area where one or more cross-profiles intersect the main
profile at said angle, comprises grooves to lodge the
extremities of cross-profiles.In the most preferred embodiment, the angles
at which the extremities of the body of the cross-profile
are bent comprise 45°, respectively 135°.A particularity of the invention is that the
flanges pertaining to a cross-profile, which are placed
underneath in working position, are smaller that the
flanges pertaining to a main profile, in such a manner
that the intersection between two cross-profiles that
reach out towards each other at an angle of 45°, resp.
135° joins precisely the lateral edge of the flange of
a main profile.Characteristic of the invention is that the
relation between the width A of a main profile and the
width B of all cross-profiles comply to the equation
B=1/2A√2.Other details and advantages of the invention
will appear from the following description of a
suspension frame for a false

<CLAIMS>
Suspension frame for a false ceiling
comprising main profiles (1) that in cross-section have

substantially the form of an inverted T, or a twofold
T, in cross-section, in other words, a profile with a

body (2) and, in working position, at least at the bottom
side two laterally veering flanges (3) and cross-profiles (5,6,7)

with an analogous cross-section cooperating therewith,
characterised in that the body (2) of said cross-profiles

(5,6,7) is extended from each extremity further
than the flanges (3) pertaining thereto and bent at an

angle, while the main profiles (1), in the area where one
or more cross-profiles (5,6,7) intersect the main

profiles at said angle, comprises grooves (4) to lodge
the extremities of cross-profiles (5,6,7).
Suspension frame as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the core-axis of all cross-profiles

intersect each other in one point on the core-axis
of the main profile where they converge.
Suspension frame as claimed in claims 1 and
2, characterised in that the angles at which the

extremities of the body (2) of the cross-profiles
(5,6,7) are bent comprise 45°, resp. 135°.
Suspension frame as claimed in any one of
the claims 1, 2 and 3, characterised in that the flanges

(3) belonging to a cross-profile (5,6,7) which are
placed underneath in working position, are smaller than

the flanges (3) belonging to a main profile, in such a
manner that the intersection between two cross-profiles

which reach out towards each other at an angle of 45°,
join precisely the edge of the flange of the main

profile.
Suspension frame as claimed in claim 4,
characterised in that the relation between the width A

of a main profile and the width B of all cross-profiles
comply to the equation B = 1/2A√2.
