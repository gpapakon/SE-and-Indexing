<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a method and a circuit arrangement for forming 
intermediate frequency signals in the radio frequency part of digital mobile phones or 

corresponding radio telephone units, the method using several local signals (LO2, LO3) 
for forming the intermediate frequency signals (IF2, IF3), whose frequency is lower 

than the radio frequency. According to the invention, one of the intermediate 
frequency signals (IF3) is formed by dividing the local signal (LO2) used for forming the 

intermediate frequency signal (IF2), whose frequency is higher than the intermediate 
frequency signal (IF3), by a suitable integer (N=2, 3, 4,...) for forming a new local 

signal (LO3), whose frequency is decreased to a corresponding degree, and by mixing 
this local signal (LO3) with the preceding intermediate frequency signal (IF2) of higher 

frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to forming intermediate frequency signals, in 
particular for radio telephones. It is previously known that all local signals needed in the radio frequency part of a 
mobile phone are synthesised using separate frequency synthesisers. Consequently, 
if the radio frequency part of the mobile phone uses three local signals, they are 
formed separately using three synthesisers or some other stable frequency source 
such as a crystal oscillator or the like. Using three frequency sources is particularly 
problematic when the radio frequencies are high, in the frequency range of 1.5 ... 
2.0 GHz, for instance. Radio telephone systems using such frequencies include JDC 
1500 (1500 MHz) and DCS1800 (1800 MHz). Voltage controlled oscillators and 
phase-locked loops are generally used in frequency synthesisers, being expensive In a first aspect the present invention provides a method for forming intermediate 
frequency signals for a radio telephone, comprising dividing a first local oscillator 
signal used to form a first intermediate frequency signal, by an integer thereby 
forming a new local signal having a frequency lower than the first local oscillator 
signal, and in a second aspect of the present invention provides apparatus for 
forming intermediate frequency signals for a radio telephone, comprising a first 
frequency synthesisers for forming a first local oscillator signal and a second 
frequency synthesiser coupled to an output of the first frequency synthesiser to 
receive the first local oscillator signal, the second frequency synthesiser including 
dividing means to divide the frequency of the first local oscillator signal input 
thereto, thereby providing a second local oscillator signal. These have the advantage that a reduced number of oscillators need be 
implemented to provide the required number of local oscillator signals. 
Furthermore, because there are fewer oscillators, there is less space required and 
also less power used than for conventional systems.  An advantage of the method in accordance with the invention for forming 
intermediate frequency signals and of the applied circuit arrangement is that the 
frequency synthesis is facilitated in the radio frequency part of mobile phones and 
other similar devices as compared to the previously known one. Another advantage 
of the invention is, in particular, that the number of phase locked loops generally 
used in frequency synthesizers can be reduced. In a particular embodiment in accordance with the
