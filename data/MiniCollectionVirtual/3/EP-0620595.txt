<ABSTRACT>
Signal wirings (WR0 to WR5) are incorporated in a 
semiconductor integrated circuit device for propagating a 

multi-bit signal (A0 to A5) from an array of pads (P0 to 
P5) to input buffer circuits (IN0 to IN5), and either 

wiring gap or wiring width is changed for canceling 
difference in time constant due to the different wiring 

lengths so that the component bits of the multi-bit signal 
concurrently arrive at the input buffer circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated 
circuit device and, more particularly, to signal wirings 
incorporated in the semiconductor integrated circuit 
device. A typical example of the signal wirings incorporated 
in a semiconductor integrated circuit device is illustrated 
in Fig. 1 of the drawings. The prior art semiconductor 
integrated circuit device is a memory device, and is 
fabricated on a single semiconductor chip 1. The 
semiconductor chip 1 has an peripheral area 2 assigned to 
an array of signal input pads P0, P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5, 
and a multi-bit address signal A0, A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 is 
supplied from the outside to the signal input pads P0 to 
P5. The semiconductor chip 1 further has an internal area 
assigned to address buffer circuits IN0, IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 
and IN5, and signal wirings WR0, WR1, WR2, WR3, WR4 and WR5 
are patterned between the array of signal input pads P0 to 
P5 and the address input buffer circuits IN0 to IN5. A  
 
wiring area 4 is assigned to the signal wirings WR0 to WR5. 
Though not shown in Fig. 1, the address buffer circuits IN0 
to IN5 temporally store the multi-bit address signals A0 to 
A5, and distribute a multi-bit internal address signal to a 
row address decoder and a column address decoder for 
selecting accessed memory cells. The signal input pads P0 to P5 are arranged in the 
peripheral area 2 at intervals, and the interval is 
determined by the interval of signal input pins (not 
shown). In this instance, the interval of the two adjacent 
signal input pads is about 1 millimeter. In this instance, the wiring area 4 is contiguous to 
the peripheral area 2, and the internal area 3 is located 
on the right side of the wiring area 4. The signal wirings 
WR0 to WR5 are three times bent at right angles, and are 
equal in width and interval to one another. In this 
instance, the width W is 1.6 microns, and the interval is 
also 1.6 microns. The address buffer circuits IN0 to IN5 are laterally 
spaced apart from the signal input pad P5 by 5 millimeters, 
and the distance between the lateral path of the signal 
wiring WR0 and the address buffer circuit IN5 is about 1 
millimeter. As a result, the total signal path of the  
 
signal wiring WR0 is more than 10 millimeters, and the total 
path of the signal wiring WR5 is six-odd millimeters. 
Thus, the signal wirings WR0 to WR5 provide the signal 
paths different in length to one another to the address 
bits A0 to A5, and parasitic capacitances coupled therewith 
are, accordingly, different from
