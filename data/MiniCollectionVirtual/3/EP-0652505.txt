<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an input/display device which
is useful as an information terminal of a facsimile
apparatus, a copying machine, an electronic filing
apparatus, a word processor, a computer, or the like.Conventionally, an information apparatus which handles
image information, such as a facsimile apparatus, a copying
machine, an electronic filing apparatus, a word processor,
or a computer is assembled and used as an individual or
independent apparatus. In an information terminal of a
facsimile apparatus, a copying machine, an electronic filing
apparatus, a word processor, a computer, or the like,
functions of displaying and inputting an image are realized
by a display device and an input device which are
independently disposed, or a display screen and an input
screen are formed at different places (sites).As the recent advance of technology, an apparatus such
as a hand-written word processor into which a character
image written on a display screen with an accompanying pen
can be input has been practically used. An apparatus of this kind is known from WO 93/250036. That document discloses a
cordless electronic stylus and electronic ink-well used to generate digital position
information. The electronic stylus is used to write or draw on an electronic display
device including, for example, a liquid crystal screen or a cathode ray tube. The
apparatus comprises a combination of a scanner and screen for editing scanned
images. In such a prior art apparatus, however, when an image
is to be input at an information terminal of a facsimile
apparatus, a copying machine, an electronic filing
apparatus, a word processor, a computer, or the like, the
position where the input operation is conducted is fixed,
and a captured image cannot be processed or combined with
another image unless the captured image is output on a
display device located at another place (site), or on a
paper sheet or the like. This produces problems in that the
operation is cumbersome and requires a prolonged period, and
that the apparatus is difficult to operate for the user who
is not skilled in operation.In a hand-written word processor, the input operation
is conducted by directly writing or drawing a character or a
picture on a display screen with an accompanying pen. As
compared with the case where the writing or drawing
operation is conducted on a paper sheet, however, the
operability is poor. Moreover, such a word processor cannot
handle an image which has been printed or drawn on a paper
sheet. Also in the case where the input
