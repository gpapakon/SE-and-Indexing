<ABSTRACT>
A receptor material conditioning apparatus is described 
for conditioning a moving paper web (12) suitable for use 

in an electrostatographic printer. The apparatus 
comprises means (101) defining a paper web path through 

the apparatus. Heating means, such as a heated drum 
(55), reduce the moisture content of paper moving along 

the paper web path. Cooling means (65), positioned 
downstream of said heating means, cool the receptor 

material moving along the receptor material path. 
Sensing means such as an electrometer (74) determine the 

electrical condition of paper before it leaves the 
apparatus. By conditioning the paper web, a higher yield 

of toner transfer in the subsequent electrostatographic 
printer can be obtained. 

Optionally two electrometers are used to thereby detect the charge 
decay.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a paper receptor material 
conditioning apparatus, in particular to such an 
apparatus for conditioning a moving paper web prior to 
entry into an electrostatographic printer. An electrostatographic printing apparatus is intended for 
making a large number of prints and finds use, e.g., in 
the field wherein classical offset printing machines are 
applied for making thousands of prints in a single run. Electrostatographic printing operates according to the 
principles and embodiments of non-impact printing as 
described, e.g., in Principles of Non-Impact Printing by 
Jerome L Johnson - Palatino Press - Irvine CA, 92715 
USA. Electrostatographic printing includes 
electrographic printing in which an electrostatic charge 
is deposited image-wise on a dielectric recording member 
as well as electrophotographic printing in which an 
overall electrostatically charged photoconductive 
dielectric recording member is image-wise exposed to 
conductivity increasing radiation producing thereby a 
"direct" or "reversal" toner-developable charge pattern 
on said recording member. The toner image is transferred onto a printing stock 
material, usually paper in the form of a web whereon the 
toner image is fixed, whereupon the web is cut into  
 
sheets containing the desired print frame. 
As can be learned from the book "The Physics and 
Technology of Xerographic Processes" by E. M. Williams 
(1984), Chapter Ten, p. 204 et seq the transfer of 
developed toner images onto paper proceeds by means of 
electrical corona devices to generate the required 
electric field to attract the charged toner from the 
electrostatographic recording member to the paper. The 
transfer efficiency of toner onto the receptor paper is 
not only dictated by the contact of the paper with the 
toner-laden recording member and the deposited charge but 
also by the conductivity of the paper and particularly by 
its water content. Paper is not a simple insulating 
dielectric, so the electrical properties of plain paper 
have some influence on toner transfer. Experiments with a variety of paper types and thicknesses 
(i.e. weights) have established that heavier papers yield 
improvement in transfer efficiency. Paper types with 
high porosity, i.e. high permeability for gases loaded 
with ions by corona discharge do not allow an efficient 
toner transfer. Variation in gas permeability or 
porosity between different paper types is due to overall 
thickness, degree of filling with clays, sizings, and 
other paper treating
