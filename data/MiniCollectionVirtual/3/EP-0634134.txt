<ABSTRACT>
In a method for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of ECG 
signals, A/D-converted signals from a plurality of cardiac 

cycles are time-synchronized to form a signal ensemble, 
whereupon the concordance between the signals in the 

ensemble is determined in time intervals, comprising at 
least two samples, during at least a part of the cardiac 

cycles. A device for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of 
ECG-signals, comprises means (4, 5) for recording, A/D-converting 

and other processing of the ECG-signals. A 
synchronization unit is arranged to time-synchronize the 

signals from a plurality of cardiac cycles to form a signal 
ensemble, and a calculator unit (12) controlled by a window 

unit is arranged to determine the concordance between the 
signals in the ensemble in time intervals, comprising at 

least two samples, during at least a part of the cardiac 
cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for
enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of ECG signals according
to the preambles of claims 1 and 8 respectively.ECG signals recorded on the exterior of the body always
contain extensive noise originating from muscular activity,
digitalization of the recorded analog ECG-signal, the
recording instruments and influence from the power supply.
Using modern technology, however, the two latter sources of
noise can be largely eliminated. But noise from the muscular
activity of the patient and the digitalization procedure
often drowns out low-amplitude signal components in the ECG
signal.In an effort to reduce noise and, thus, improve the signal-to-noise
ratio for these low-amplitude signal components,
the ECG signals have hitherto been subjected to different
kinds of averaging procedures. Time-varying Wiener
filtration has also been attempted in order to enhance the
signal-to-noise ratio, see Weerd and Martens: "Theory and
Practice of A Posteriori Wiener Filtering of Average Evoked
Potentials", Biol. Cybern., 30, pp. 81-94, (1978), and Weerd
and Kap.: "A Posteriori TimeVarying Filtering of Averaged
Evoked Potentials", Biol. Cybern., 41, pp. 223-234, (1981).
This technic is based on the estimated signal and noise
effects determined for different frequencies. In this
process, some spectral leakage is unavoidable in the Fourier
transform procedure utilized. With low signal-to-noise
ratios, this method also results in consistently erroneous
estimation of the signal in the noise.The object of the present invention is to propose a new
method and provide a new device which makes possible
additional enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio which,
in its turn, makes possible estimation of low-amplitude
signal components in the ECG signal, such as so-called "late 
potentials", without use of Fourier transform with all its
disadvantages.This object is achieved with a method according to claim 1
and a device according to claim 8.In the present invention representative parts of ECG-signals
from a plurality of cardiac cycles are thus filtered in a
filter the characteristics of which are related to the
prevailing signal-to-noise ratio.Thus according to the invention, the signals from a
plurality of cardiac cycles are time-synchronized to form a
signal ensemble, and the correlation across the signal
ensemble is determined, although not the time correlation.
In this way the size of the resulting cross-covariance
matrix is reduced such that determination of the optimum
