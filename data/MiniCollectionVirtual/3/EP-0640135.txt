<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel immunoglobulin binding proteins.
processes for their production and recombinant DNA molecules coding
therefor.More specifically the present invention relates to synthetic
proteins containing repeated sequences derived from selected binding
regions of Protein L and to recombinant DNA molecules coding therefor.A multitude of Gram-positive bacteria species have been isolated
that express surface proteins with affinities for mammalian
immunoglobulins through interaction with their heavy chains. The best
known of these immunoglobulin binding proteins are type 1 Staphylococcus
Protein A and type 2 Streptococcus Protein G which have been shown to
interact principally through the C2-C3 interface on the Fc region of
human immunoglobulins. In addition, both have also been shown to
interact weakly to the Fab region, but again through the immunoglobulin
heavy chain.Recently, a novel protein from Peptococcus magnus, Protein L, has
been reported that was found to bind to human, rabbit, porcine, mouse
and rat immunoglobulins uniquely through interaction with their light
chains. In humans this interaction has been shown to occur exclusively
to the kappa chains. Since both kappa and lambda light chains are
shared between different classes. Protein L binds strongly to all human
classes, in particular to the multi-subunited IgM, and similarly is
expected to bind to all classes in species that show Protein L light
chain binding. Both peptococcus and peptostreptococcus have been reported to
produce Protein L, which binds to the Kappa light chain of human
immunoglobulins. It has been proposed that Protein L is a virulence
factor; non-virulent peptococci and peptostreptococci appear to neither
express Protein L nor have the structural gene for it (Kastern et al
1990).Protein L is of particular interest since it has been reported to bind
to the Kappa light chain which is present in all classes and sub classes
of immunoglobulins. As such it should prove to be a useful diagnostic
reagent for use in ELISA and RIA techniques.EP-A-0 255 497 describes the purification and attempted
characterisation of Protein L by standard protein purification
techniques. Subsequently, the authors of EP-A-0 255 497 have published
a number of scientific papers describing further investigations into the
nature and structure of Protein L, but to date, attempts fully to
characterize the protein have failed. Thus recently, in a paper
entitled "Protein L a Bacterial Immunoglobulin-Binding Protein and
Possible Virulence
