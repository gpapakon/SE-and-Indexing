<ABSTRACT>
A technique involving the standardization of 
the subject matter of an image and the compression of the 

image using features of the standardization can provide 
for a high compression ratio. This technique can be used 

to improve the quality of a restored image for a 
predetermined amount of storage space.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
digital image compression and decompression. In 
particular, the method is customized to be applied to a 
large library of similar digital images where the 
variety and location of image features are known in 
advance. In general, image compression seeks to reduce 
the storage requirements for an image. Decompression 
restores the image. Not all compression/decompression 
processes restore images to their original form. Those 
which do are called "lossless" methods. In general, 
lossless methods do not compress images as highly as do 
lossy methods which change the image and introduce some 
degradation in image quality. In applications where 
high-compression ratios are desired, lossy methods are 
used most frequently. Images can be compressed as they contain 
spatial correlation. This correlation implies that 
differences in neighboring pixel values are small 
compared to the dynamic range of the image. A basic 
rule-of-thumb is that more correlation implies a 
greater potential for higher compression ratios without 
loss of visual image fidelity. The vast majority of 
image compression methods have their foundations in 
broad statistical measures. Some methods are more 
sophisticated and vary the compression algorithm based 
upon local statistics (see M. Rabbani and J. P. Jones, 
"Digital Image Compression Techniques," vol., T77, SPIE 
Press, Bellingham, Washington, 1991). However, all of 
these techniques are applied to the entire image as  
 
there is no prior knowledge of image features and image 
position. The statistics account for correlations 
between neighboring pixels; they do not account for 
correlations between groups of pixels in corresponding 
locations of different images. Compression algorithms have been developed to 
handle motion sequences of images such a sequential 
frames of a motion picture (see Bernd Jahne, "Digital 
Image Processing: Concepts, Algorithms, and Scientific 
Applications", Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1991). Images 
taken close in time have a high degree of correlation 
between them, and the determination of the differences 
between the images as the movement of the image 
segments leads to large compression ratios. This type 
of image-to-image correlation works well for images 
which undergo incremental distortions. Other collections of images have image-to-image 
correlation, but not to the degree that motion 
sequences posses and do not compress well with motion 
algorithms. Consider a library of pictures of missing 
chi
