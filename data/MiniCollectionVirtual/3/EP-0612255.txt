<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an injection device (1) adapted to engage a deformable plastic ampoule (2) having a reservoir (3) and a neck portion (4), said device comprising: a body (5) having a continuous fluid conduit (6) therethrough, the fluid conduit comprising at one end a male frusto-conical extending member (8) forming a sealing surface with a corresponding parallel walled or frusto-conical female recess (10) on the neck portion (4) of said ampoule (2) when the ampoule and the device are cooperatively engaged. This device is simple to use and is suitable for self-injection by patients.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an injection device 
for medical or veterinary injection. It will be 
convenient to describe the invention in relation to 
injection devices for self injection by relatively 
unskilled operators to treat medical conditions although 
it will be appreciated that the invention has much wider 
application. Numerous medical conditions require treatment of a 
patient by self injection of drug, for example 
insulin-dependant diabetes is generally treated by self 
injection of insulin; male erectile impotence is often 
treated by way of intracavernosal injection of erectile 
impotence treating drugs. In both the above medical 
conditions self injection is generally by way of insulin 
syringes. These syringes are long and thin and usually 
have a fine gauge needle already attached to the syringe 
during manufacture. While such needles may be adequate 
for young dextrous hands which can manipulate this type of 
syringe, they can be cumbersome and very difficult to 
handle by older or infirm persons with limited 
coordination and who may also be afflicted with complaints 
such as arthritis which may further effect dexterity. 
Moreover, with the insulin type syringe, it is necessary 
for the user to have a relatively wide extension between 
the thumb and index finger to manipulate and actuate the 
syringe properly. This may cause a problem with older 
users who cannot easily extend their thumb or index finger 
across a broad extension to manipulate an insulin type 
syringe. Other risks are associaterd with injection of 
substances. First, particularly in cases of intravenous 
injection there exists the danger of injecting air and 
causing embolism. Secondly, there is a danger of drawing 
up physiological fluids or the drug just injected upon 
completion of injection or if the injecting pressure is 
released during injection. Furthermore there is nearly always a risk of  
 
contamination of the injection apparatus by handling of exposure to the environment. 
This risk is not only present where an unskilled operator is involved, but also where 
a skilled practitioner is acting in adverse conditions such as accident or emergency 
scenes or war zones. US-A-2828743 discloses a snap-on cartridge needle unit in which a hub or 
stopper engages with a rigid syringe body, for use with a non-deformable ampoule. 
EP-A-0356679 describes a corresponding device, incorporating a deformable 
ampoule. In each case, the needle-connecting assembly is secured to the ampoule 
on the outside of the

<CLAIMS>
An injection device comprising a deformable ampoule 
(2) having a neck portion (4) to which is attached a body 

(5) having a continuous fluid conduit (6) extending 
therethrough and a distal injection needle (7), and a one-way 

valve in the conduit (6), characterised in that the 
body (5) also includes an integral proximal hollow male 

frustoconical member (8) having an outer surface (9) in 
sealing engagement with an inner surface (10) of the 

amouple's neck portion (4), that the body (5) further 
comprises a proximal annular collar (11) separate from and 

surrounding the male frustoconical member (8) and having an 
inner surface (13) in engagement with an outer surface of 

the ampoule's neck portion (4), and that the body (5) also 
comprises a distal annular collar (17) separate from and 

surrounding the needle (7), for limiting the depth of 
insertion of the needle. 
The injection device of claim 1, wherein the proximal 
annular collar (11) comprises one or more barbed members 

(12) for engagement with the outer surface of the ampoule's 
neck portion (4). 
The injection device of claim 2, wherein the or each 
barbed member (12) has an inner surface (13) which slopes 

radially inwards towards the body (5). 
The injection device of claim 2, wherein the proximal 
annular collar (11) includes one or more cut-out portions 

adjacent to the or each barbed member (12). 
The injection device of any of claims 2 to 4, which 
comprises two barbed members (12), mounted opposite to each 

other on the proximal annular collar (11). 
The injection device of claim 1, wherein the outer 
surface of the ampoule neck portion (4) and the inner 

surface (13) of the proximal annular collar (11) comprise 
cooperative liner fittings.
