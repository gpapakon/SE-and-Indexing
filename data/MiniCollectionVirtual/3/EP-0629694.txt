<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of aqueous
compositions for carpet cleaning.Carpets produced from synthetic or natural fibres and
mixtures thereof are commonly used in residential and
commercial applications as a floor covering. Various types of
fibres can be used in making carpets such as polyamide and
wool.However, carpets irrespective of whether they are made
from natural or synthetic fibres are all prone to soiling and
staining when contacted with many household items. Beverages in
particular such as coffee, tea and soft drinks especially those
containing acidic dyes can cause unsightly, often dark stains
on carpets. In addition fibres may become soiled as a result of
dirt particles, grease, oils, foods, pet stains and other solid
materials which may be inorganic or organic coming into contact
with and adhering to the fibres of the carpet. Stains or soils are often not readily removed from the
carpets, especially if not treated immediately after the
spillage has occurred. Indeed, if the stain or soil has become
dry the difficulty of removing the stain or soil effectively is
significantly increased. As a result of soiling and staining
the carpets become unsightly, often malodorous and unhygienic.Carpets may often also be inhabited by microinsects such
as house lice and mites. The presence of microinsects is
considered unhygienic and thus it is desirable that such
insects can be exterminated and removed from the carpet.There are a number of carpet cleaning compositions
described in the art for removing stains and soils. For example
volatile solvent dry cleaning fluids. However, these
compositions are not effective on water-soluble stains or
soils. Aqueous compositions comprising synthetic detergents
have also been described, but are also not satisfactory,
especially on colour stains such as coffee, fruit juices and
beverages.Other aqueous compositions which have been disclosed in
the art are compositions comprising hydrogen peroxide having an
alkaline pH. However, these compositions are not stable. The pH
must be adjusted just prior to use. This is inconvenient both
to the manufacturer, who must supply the ingredients separately
and the consumer, who must regulate the pH of the composition
before applying it to the area to be treated.The present invention is the use of a stable aqueous
composition comprising hydrogen peroxide or sources thereof
having an acidic pH for the cleaning of carpets.An advantage of the present invention is that the
composition is stable and does not require pH
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The use of a stable aqueous composition comprising from 0,1% to 15%
of active oxygen and having a pH of from 1 to 6 for the

cleaning of carpets whereby said composition is stored for a long
period of time prior to use and applied to the area to be

treated by using a spraying device.
The use of a stable aqueous composition according to claim
1, wherein the pH is from 2 to 5.
The use of a stable aqueous composition according to any of
the preceding claims wherein the composition comprises

hydrogen peroxide and sources thereof as sources of active oxygen.
The use of a stable aqueous composition according to any of
the preceding claims wherein the composition comprises a mixture

of peracid precursors and hydrogen peroxide as source of active oxygen.
The use of a stable aqueous composition according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said composition further

comprises a surfactant or mixtures thereof.
The use of a stable aqueous composition according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said composition further

comprises a chelant.
The use of a stable aqueous composition according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said composition further

comprises a solvent.
The use of a stable aqueous composition according to any of
the preceding claims in carpet cleaning machines.
The use of a stable aqueous composition according to any of the
preceding claims, wherein said spray device is pump operated.
