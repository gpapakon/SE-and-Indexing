<ABSTRACT>
Narrow strips made of steel of high carbon content of between 0.30 and 1 %, which have good suitability for cold rolling. These strips originate from a splitting of a wide strip obtained by hot rolling a slab or ingot on a continuous line while hot, pickling the wide strip rolled when hot, and continuous cold rolling followed by a globulisation annealing. The invention also relates to a process for the manufacture of strips of this type.

<CLAIMS>
Process of manufacturing narrow strips
having a width of between 150 and 600 mm and made of steel

having a high carbon content of between 0.30 and 1% and in
particular between 0.65 and 0.70%, and having good

aptitude to cold-rolling, a process in which:

a slab or ingot is hot-rolled in order to
obtain a wide hot-rolled strip,
the hot-rolled wide strip is scaled,
the scaled and hot-rolled wide strip is cold-rolled
in order to reduce the thickness,
a spheroidizing annealing of the wide strip is
carried out
and the said wide strip is split in order to
obtain the said narrow strips.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised
in that between the spheroidizing annealing and the

splitting of the wide strip, there is carried out at least
one cold re-rolling of the said wide strip in order to

obtain the desired thickness and a re-crystallisation

annealing is carried out after each cold re-rolling.
Process of manufacturing narrow strips made
of steel having a carbon content of between 0.30 and 0.80%

according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
temperature at the end of the hot-rolling is higher than

the temperature of austenite-ferrite conversion AC
3
.
Process of manufacturing narrow strips made
of steel having a carbon content of between 0.80 and 1%

according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
temperature at the end of the hot-rolling is higher than

the temperature of austenite-cementite conversion AC
m
.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the scaling is a scaling with hydrochloric acid.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the scaling is a scaling with sulphuric acid.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the spheroidizing annealing is carried out whilst

maintaining the wide strip at a temperature of between 650
and 720째C for 2 to 30 hours, and preferably at a

temperature of between 680 and 700째C for 5 to 15 hours.
Process according to Claim 7, characterised
in that the rate of increase in temperature of the wide

strip in order to being it to its spheroidizing annealing
temperature is 60째C per hour.
Process according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the re-crystallisation annealing is carried out at

a temperature of between 650 and 720째C.
