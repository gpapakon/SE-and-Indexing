<ABSTRACT>
Switch circuits 21 and 22 are opened before switch circuits 31 and 32 or 41 and 
42 are opened so that any clock field through-noises inputted from the switch circuits 31 

and 32 are not inputted to a differential amplifier circuit 10, 20. Also switch circuits 11, 
12, 51 and 52 are closed immediately before a comparison operation is started by the 

switch circuit 21 and 22 so that the differential amplifier circuit remains balanced, 
thereby realising a high-speed comparator circuit which is unaffected by noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a comparator circuit for use in an analog-to-digital 
conversion circuit apparatus or the like. Hitherto, an A/D converter has been known for converting an analog signal 
having a video frequency band of approximately 6 MHz into a digital signal by the 
CMOS technique. There have been known, parallel A/D converters, including 
comparators which compare reference voltages of the number corresponding to the 
resolution of the A/D converter with analog input signals, and serial-parallel A/D 
converters which classify digital data into a higher rank and a lower rank for conversion: 
as a consequence of which the number of comparators is remarkably reduced in 
comparison with the parallel A/D converter. Among the converters of this type, in an 
A/D converter having the resolution of 8 bits or more, an analog/digital hybrid 
semiconductor integrated circuit device in which an A/D converter and a digital signal 
processing circuit are formed into one chip. Because they are largely affected by noises 
from a power source, there are mostly used as differential chopper type comparator 
circuits. These differential chopper type comparator circuits use differential amplifier 
circuits which are strong against the noises from the power source and remarkably 
reduce offset voltage. However this causes a problem in a CMOS differential amplifier 
circuit, for example, as shown in Fig. 2A. In Fig. 2A, analog switches 11, 12, 31, 32, 41, 42, 51 and 52 are controlled by 
control signals Φs1, Φs, Φcand Φs3, respectively, and the respective control signals are 
applied to the analog switches of comparator circuits shown Fig. 2A in accordance with 
timing charts shown in Fig. 2B.  In the case where the control signals are applied to an example of the 
conventional comparator circuit shown in Fig. 2A in accordance with the timing charts 
of Fig. 2B, the circuit operates in the following manner. Also assume that C1 and C1' 
are equal to each other, and C2 and C2' are equal to each other in capacitance. 
(1) When each of Φs, Φs1and Φs3 are at a "H" level and Φc is at a "L" 
level, one end of the capacitors C1 and C1' are applied with input voltages V1 and V3 
by the operation of the switches 31 and 32, respectively. Differential amplifier circuits 
10 and 20 have input and output terminals which are opposite in phase and short-circuited 
by the switch circuits 11 and 12 and by the switch circuits 51, 52, respectively. 
In the differential amplifier circuit 10, an input terminal 1 and an output
