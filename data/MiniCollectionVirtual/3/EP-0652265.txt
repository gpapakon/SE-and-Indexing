<ABSTRACT>
A powder coating composition contains acrylic resin (A) 
containing at least 40 percent by weight of a glycidyl-group-containing 

monomer and having a solubility parameter 
which is in the range of 11.0 to 11.6 and a glass transition 

temperature of at least 20°C, a surface modifier (B) consisting 
of a polymer having a solubility parameter which is 

in the range of 10.4 to 11.0, and polyvalent carboxylic acid 
(B). The surface modifier (B) is in a content of 0.1 to 4 

parts by weight with respect to a total content of 100 parts 
by weight of the acrylic resin (A) and the polyvalent carboxylic 

acid (C), while the components are so mixed with 
each other that the amount of carboxylic
 groups contained in 
the polyvalent carboxylic acid (C) is at an equivalence 

ratio of at least 0.5 to the amount of glycidyl groups 
contained in the acrylic resin (A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powder coating
composition which is employed for coating an automobile, a
building material or a metal product, and to a method of coating an
aluminum material with such a powder coating composition.
Description of the Background ArtAcrylic resin powder coating material is watched with
interest in view of an excellent appearance of a coating
film as formed, weather resistance, solvent resistance,
flexibility and the like. Powder coating material which is
applied to clear coating or the like is known as such an
acrylic resin powder coating material. For example, each of
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 53-15089 (1978), 58-4947
(1983) and 58-25388 (1983) discloses acrylic resin powder
coating material prepared from acrylic resin containing
glycidyl groups, which is heat-cured after coating.Such acrylic resin powder coating material is baked at
a temperature of 160 to 180°C after coating, while it is
desired that a coating film can be formed by baking the
coating material at a lower temperature of 130 to 160°C, for
example, in consideration of productivity and energy saving.
When conventional acrylic resin powder coating material is
baked at such a low temperature, however, the appearance of 
the coating film is deteriorated with reduction in weather
resistance and blocking resistance. While it may be possible
to add a curing catalyst to the coating material for
facilitating curing at a low temperature, storage stability
is deteriorated in this case.An object of the present invention is to provide a
powder coating composition, which can be baked at a low
temperature, enabling for providing a coating film which is
excellent in appearance, weather resistance and blocking
resistance.The powder coating composition according to the present
invention contains acrylic resin (A) containing 40 to 65
percent by weight of a glycidyl-group-containing monomer and
having a solubility parameter which is in the range of 11.0
to 11.6 and a glass transition temperature of at least 20°C,
a surface modifier (B) consisting of a polymer having a
solubility parameter which is in the range of 10.4 to 11.0,
and polyvalent carboxylic acid (C). These components are so
mixed with each other that the powder coating composition
contains 0.1 to 4 parts by weight of the surface modifier
(B) with respect to a total content of 100 parts by weight
of the acrylic resin (A) and the polyvalent carboxylic acid
(C) and the amount of the carboxyl groups contained in the
polyvalent carboxylic acid (C) is more
