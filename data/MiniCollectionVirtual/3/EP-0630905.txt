<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for 
preparing lactone intermediates to 2',2'-difluoronucleosides 

whereby reversion back to the lactone's open chain 
precursor is minimized and the desired erythro enantiomer 

can be selectively isolated from an enantiomeric mixture 
of erythro and threo lactones in crystalline form. Also 

provided is a process for producing 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoronucleosides 
in about a 1:1 α/β anomeric ratio, 

and processes for selectively isolating β-2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine, 
or an organic or inorganic acid addition 

salt thereof, from the 1:1 α/β mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides a novel separation process for
preparing 2',2'-difluoronucleosides or organic or inorganic acid
addition salts thereof.United States Patent No. 4,526,988 teaches
that 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoronucleosides are useful anti-viral
agents. European Patent Application 184,365
teaches the use of the same compounds as oncolytic
agents. The synthetic process disclosed in the publications
produces intermediates containing up to two
centers of chirality. One such intermediate having a
chiral center is a protected lactone consisting of
erythro and threo enantiomers of the formulae

wherein P is a protecting group. The publications teach
the erythro enantiomer is preferred since it provides a
carbohydrate which has the stereochemistry of naturally
occurring ribose. A carbohydrate which has the stereochemistry 
of naturally occurring ribose is preferred
since it provides final product nucleosides which
exhibit superior biological activity.United States Patent No. 4,526,988 teaches the
preparation of the above described erythro enantiomer by
first forming an alkyl 2,2-difluoro-3-hydroxy-3-(2,2-dialkyldioxolan-4-yl)propionate,
consisting of 3-R- and
3-S- hydroxy enantiomers, of the formulae

wherein R4 and R5 are independently C1-C3 alkyl, in a
ratio of about 3 parts 3-R- enantiomer to about 1 part
3-S- enantiomer. The publication discloses that the
3-R- hydroxy enantiomer has the proper stereochemistry
to provide the desired erythro enantiomer and that the
3-R- and 3-S- enantiomers can be separated by expensive,
laborious column chromatography procedures.The patent teaches that once the 3-R- hydroxy
enantiomer is isolated it is next hydrolyzed under very
mild conditions to form an unprotected lactone; namely, 
2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-D-erythro-pentofuranos-1-ulose,
which has the formula

The publication teaches that mild conditions useful for
forming the above compound include the use of hydrolysis
reagents such as mildly acidic ion exchange resins or
relatively strong acids, such as aqueous acetic acid or
chloroacetic acid, which have a pKa between about 2.8 to
about 5.0. Both types of hydrolysis reagents can cause
problems in the hydrolysis reaction. For example, the
use of ion exchange resin requires such large quantities
of water that, especially in larger scale reactions, the
lactone often reverts back to its open chain precursor
because of its sensitivity to water. The relatively
strong acids, on the other hand, are less preferred
hydrolysis reagents for converting the 3-R- hydroxy
enantiomer
