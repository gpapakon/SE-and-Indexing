<ABSTRACT>
A pipe handling machine (28) for moving well 
pipes (13) arranged essentially horizontally and 

essentially parallel to one another on a deck (12), and 
including a carriage which may contain an operator's 

control cabin and is mounted by tracks (30, 130) for 
movement tranversely of the pipes (13), with an arm 

projecting from the carriage and adapted to support a 
pipe (13) from one of its ends as a cantilever, and with 

the arm being power actuable upwardly and downwardly to 
raise and lower a pipe (13) and in its elevated position 

shift the pipe (13) laterally with the carriage. The arm 
may deliver the pipe (13) to or receive it from an 

inclined conveyor (29) leading to the rig floor (19). 
Preferably, two such machines (28, 31) are provided for 

shifting pipes (13) on two storage decks (12, 22) at 
different levels, and for delivering pipes (19) to or 

from an intermediate conveyor system (25, 128) extending 
between the two decks (12, 22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved apparatus for
moving well pipe to and from a pipe storage deck adjacent a
well drilling rig.It is conventional in drilling rigs to store pipe
when not in use on a supporting deck near the derrick, with
the pipes extending horizontally on the deck and parallel to
one another. When one of the pipes is to be added to a string
in the well, the pipe is usually lifted by a crane or other
hoisting equipment from the horizontal storage position to
a generally central position, and is then pulled upwardly a-long
a V-door ramp to the drilling location using auxiliary
hoisting equipment. When a length of pipe is removed from the
string, it is lowered by the auxiliary hoisting equipment and
the crane back to its horizontal position on the deck. These
handling methods normally employed involve considerable manual
manipulation of the pipes, with the expenditure of more
rig time than would be desired in the handling process, and
with substantial danger to the rig personnel. Inclined conveyors
have been proposed for mechanically advancing a length
of pipe upwardly from a storage deck to the drilling rig, or
downwardly from the rig to the deck, but problems still remain
in transporting the pipes between their horizontal storage
positions and the conveyor, or between different horizontally
extending positions on a storage deck or decks. In WO-A-88/01008 there is disclosed an apparatus
for moving pipes arranged essentially horizontally and
essentially parallel to one another on a deck, near a well,
comprising a pipe handling machine having a main body
mounted near an end of said pipes, a pipe supporting
structure connected to said main body and including holding
means for supporting a pipe, and elevating means for moving
said pipe supporting structure and a pipe supported thereby
upwardly and downwardly to raise the pipe from or lower it
onto the deck.The object of the present invention is to provide
an improved apparatus for moving well pipe sections between
different positions on a storage deck or within a storage
area, and between a horizontal position on such a deck and
an inclined position on a conveyor by which the pipe is to
be advanced to a drilling location; which apparatus can be
installed on a standard rig very easily and rapidly, and
without substantial alteration of the rig, which occupies a
minimum amount of space, does not interfere with other
operations performed on the rig, and structurally is very
simple and inexpensive, and which is effective to move a
length of pipe

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for moving pipes (13) arranged
essentially horizontally and essentially parallel to one

another on a deck (12), near a well, comprising:

a pipe handling machine (28) having:
a main body (53) mounted near an end of said pipes
(13),
a pipe supporting structure (68, 78, 81) connected
to said main body (53) and including holding means (78, 81)

for supporting a pipe (13), and
elevating means (70) for moving said pipe
supporting structure (68, 78, 81) and a pipe (13) supported

thereby upwardly and downwardly to raise the pipe (13) from
or lower it onto the deck (12),
characterized in that said main body comprises a
carriage (53), and that said holding means (78, 81) is

adapted to support a pipe (13) as a cantilever, holding the
pipe (13) near said one end thereof with the center of

gravity (CG2) of the pipe (13) being beyond said holding
means (78, 81), and that said apparatus includes carriage

shifting means (30, 130, 60, 61, 62, 63) for moving said
carriage (53) and said pipe supporting structure (68, 78,

81) and a pipe (13) supported thereby along a path
extending transversely of the pipe (13).
Apparatus as recited in claim 1, in which said
pipe supporting structure (68, 78, 81) includes an arm (68)

which projects from the main body (53) as a cantilever
