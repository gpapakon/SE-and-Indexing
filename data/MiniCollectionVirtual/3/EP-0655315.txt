<ABSTRACT>
By the invention it is intended to bring about a rapid build-up of the mould pressure for the compressed-air forming of an article made out of a thermoplastic sheet, without exceeding the predetermined value. This is achieved by installing a proportional valve, which feeds the forming air initially with the full cross-section and then, dependent on the forming pressure produced, constricts this cross-section shortly before reaching the forming pressure and closes it when the forming pressure is reached. The invention is represented characteristically by Figure 1.

Method of controlling the mould pressure for compressed air moulding of an article
from a heated thermoplastic foil strip (2), which in that case is deep drawn in mould (3, 4),

characterised in that a signal corresponding to the mould pressure preset in the control
acts on a proportional valve (1
2, 17), which is arranged in the feed of the mould air, so that
this initially frees the mould air in full cross-section, throttles this on approach to the preset

mould pressure and blocks this on reaching of the mould pressure.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the feed of the mould release air
to the mould halves (4) with the mould of the article to be produced (5) similarly takes

place by way of a proportional valve (18), to which a control signal of the control
corresponding to the preset mould release pressure is fed.
Device for carrying out the method according to claim 1 with a mould station with
two mould tables (1, 2), which are displaceable relative to one another, for reception of the

mould halves (3, 4), a transport device for intermittent transport of a foil strip (7) and ducts
(15, 16) for the feed of compressed air to the mould halves (3, 4), characterised in that a

proportional valve (12, 17), on which a control signal corresponding to the mould pressure
preset in the control acts, is incorporated in the duct (15) of the mould air.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that a proportional valve (18), on
which a control signal corresponding to the mould pressure preset in the control acts, is

arranged in the duct (16) of the mould release air.
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that a valve (19, 20), which has a
connection for vacuum at the inlet side, is incorporated in the ducts (15, 16) for mould air

and mould release air.
Device according to one of claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the proportional
valves (12, 17, 18) have an outlet (14) for the mould air.
