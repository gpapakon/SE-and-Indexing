<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is an EIB module, which consists of a universal, programmable bus connector and a terminal device with up to four input or output channels. A test button (T1) and a signal diode (D1) are assigned to each channel. Also, a logical switch (20) is provided, the bus control signal (BS) is present at one of its inputs, and the test signal (TS), which is triggered by the test button (T1) being pressed, is present at its other input (22). An actuator simulation signal (AS1) then appears at the output (23) e.g. of an output channel, and causes a relay (RL) to pick up, following which a supply voltage is present at an actuator clamp (A1). The switch (20) is an OR gate, which is connected so that the bus control signal (BS) which is present at the input (21) has priority over the test signal (TS). The signal diode (D1) is connected between the line (23) with the actuator simulation signal (AS1) and the internal power supply.

An EIB module, comprising a universal bus coupler 
(1) and a function-specific terminal device (2) with at 

least one output channel (A1,A2,A3,A4), characterised by the 
following features: 


each channel (A1 ... A4) is associated with a signal 
diode (D1 ... D4) and a test button (T1 ... T4), 


wherein the signal diode (D1 ... D4) indicates the 
switching signal of the EIBus (6) and the test button 

(T1 ... T4) emits an actuator simulation signal (AS1 
... AS4) to the associated actuator (Ar1 ... Ar4), 
a logic switch (20) is provided with two inputs (21,22) 
and one output (23), 
the bus switching signal (BS) is applied to one input 
(21), 
the test signal (TS) is applied to the other input 
(22), 
the actuator simulation signal (AS1) appears at the 
output (23).
