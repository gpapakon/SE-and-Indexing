<ABSTRACT>
A fastening arrangement for an auxiliary equipment item on an 
engine comprises at least one position compensating fastening 

arrangement. This includes a pair of conical bushes (22, 24) 
inserted in one another. The outer bush (22) is 

longitudinally slit and a fixing screw (26) runs through the 
inner bush (24) and may be applied axially against the 

latter. One of the two components (the fixing screw (26) or 
the pair of bushes (22, 24)) is fastened in a fastening hole 

(34) in the engine or in an element (20) attached to the 
latter, while the other component (the fixing screw or the 

pair of bushes) is fastened in a fastening hole (50) in a 
bush-shaped fastening element (48) of the auxiliary equipment 

item or in a supporting bracket for the auxiliary equipment 
item. Tightening results in the outer bush (22) being 

pressed axially by the inner bush (24) to abut against 
opposing components in order to create an immovable 

connection between the elements before they are locked firmly 
to one another. This prevents the auxiliary equipment item 

being subjected, during the final tightening of the fixing 
screw, to disadvantageous clamping forces owing to play (s‚ÇÅ) 

arising between the auxiliary equipment item and the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a positional error compensating 
fastening arrangement for fastening an auxiliary equipment 
item to an internal combustion engine. A fastening arrangement of 
this kind may for example be used for fastening a fuel 
injection pump to an internal combustion engine used for 
powering a vehicle. On internal combustion engines for the powering of vehicles 
it is often necessary to be able to removably fasten various 
kinds of auxiliary equipment items or units directly to the 
engine or to a mounting device firmly attached to the engine. 
The need to do so applies particularly to equipment items 
which are driven directly by the engine via some kind of 
transmission. A typical example of such auxiliary equipment 
items driven by vehicle engines is the fuel injection pump of 
a diesel engine. Such an injection pump is usually driven by 
the engine crankshaft via a chain transmission or gearwheel 
transmission. In such cases the injection pump is usually 
flange-mounted in a transmission housing at the forward end 
of the vehicle's engine, in which case the pump shaft is 
driven by, for example, a gearwheel which forms part of a 
gearwheel transmission. Diesel engines for heavier vehicles are often six-cylinder 
in-line engines or eight-cylinder vee-engines, which means 
that the engine's injection pump has six or eight regulating 
pistons, since each cylinder has its own injector which is 
supplied with shots of fuel from the injection pump. This 
results in the injection pump being relatively long, which 
means that it is not sufficient for only one end of the pump 
to be fastened to the engine, as is normal practice in, for  
 
example, four-cylinder diesel engines. The pump therefore 
also has to have a fastening at its other end. This is not 
only because it is desirable to avoid an excessively long 
unsupported length of injection pump but also because a 
relatively large power is required to drive an injection pump 
for six or eight cylinders, which means that large reaction 
forces have to be absorbed by the pump fastening. However, fastening the injection pump at both ends involves 
the disadvantage that the fastening holes in the 
engine/engine block and the respective mounting holes in the 
fastening element of the pump have to be very exactly 
positioned so that the pump can be fitted on or to the 
engine/engine block without risk of the pump fastening 
causing oblique stressing of the engine. For production 
engineering and other reasons, it is in fact not possible at 
reas

Positional error compensating fastening arrangement for fastening an auxiliary 
equipment item (2) to an internal combustion engine (18, 52) whereby the auxiliary 

equipment item or an element firmly attached to it (48, 54) constitutes a first fastening 
element and the engine (18, 52) or an element firmly attached to it (20) constitutes a second 

fastening element, 

comprising a pair of bushes comprising an outer and an inner conical bush (22, 
24) the conical surfaces of which engage with one another, the outer bush (22) of which has a cylindrical outer surface 

(32) and is slit along its length, and by a fixing screw (26) which runs through the inner 
bush (24) and may be applied axially to the inner bush (24), whereby the pair of bushes 

(22, 24) are fastened in a fastening hole (34,60) in one of the fastening elements (20, 54), while the 
fixing screw is fastened in a fastening hole (50,56) in the other fastening element (48, 52) 

the outer bush (22) being accommodated by its said outer surface for axial movement in the fastening hole (34,60) 
accommodating the bushes upon tightening of the fixing screw (26) resulting from the 

force exerted by the inner bush (24) which pushes the outer bush (22) slightly outwards 
from the fastening hole (34,60) accommodating the bushes until the end surface (64) of the 

outer bush (22) which faces away from the fastening hole (34,60) accommodating the 
bushes abuts against an adjacent surface (66) of the other fastening element (48, 52) accommodating the 

fixing screw thereby eliminating axial play (s

, s

) between the fastening elements before 
the fixing screw is further tightened and the outer bush (22) is expanded to be clamped in 

the fastening hole (34,60) accommodating the bushes, and 
the fixing screw (26) being accommodated with radial play (s2, s4) in either the other 
fastening element (48) or the inner bush (24) to compensate for radially incorrect 

positioned fastening holes in the fastening elements. 
Fastening arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised
 in that the inner bush (24) is 
screwably connected to the fixing screw (26), has a conical 

outside, is accommodated for axial movement in a

slit outer bush (22), which 
is inserted in the pertinent fastening hole (34) in a 

flange (20) assembled firmly to the engine, and that the 
inner bush (24) and the flange are provided with devices (42, 

38) which prevent rotation of the inner bush (24) in the 
fastening hole (34).  

 
Fastening arrangement according to claim 2,
characterised
 in that the rotation preventing 
devices consist of a recess (42) in the inner bush (24) and a 

locking pin (38) which engages with that recess, is anchored

and into the recess (42) in the inner bush. 
Fastening arrangement according to claim 2 or 3,
characterised
 in that the fixing screw (26) 

which is screwed into a threaded hole in the inner bush (24) 
has, at its end which points away from the fastening hole 

(34) which accommodates the pair of bushes, a head (44) 
whereby the fixing screw can be tightened against an end 

surface (46) of a bush-shaped fastening element (48) of the 
auxiliary equipment item (2) through which the fixing screw 

(26) runs with radial play (s

), and that tightening of the 
fixing screw against the end surface (46) of the fastening 

element (48) and the consequent force exerted by the inner 
bush (24) can push the outer bush (22) slightly outwards from 

the fastening hole (34) until the end surface of the outer 
bush (22) which faces away from the fastening hole abuts 

against an adjoining other end surface of the fastening 
element (48). 
Fastening arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised
 in that the pair of bushes (22, 24) 
include the inner bush (24) which is accommodated with radial 

play (s

(22), which is inserted in the 
pertinent fastening hole (60) for the auxiliary equipment 

item (2).  
 
Fastening arrangement according to claim 5,
characterised
 in that the fixing screw (26), 
which with radial play (s

be tightened to abut against the adjoining end surface (58) 

of the inner bush (24) which can thus be pushed into the 
surrounding outer bush (22), the end surface (64) of which 

pointing away from the screw head (44) can thus be moved to 
abut against an adjoining surface (66) of the engine, after 

which the outer bush (22) can, by expansion of its 
cylindrical outer surface (32), be clamped in a fastening hole (60) 

in a supporting bracket (54) pertaining to the auxiliary 
equipment item (2). 
Fastening arrangement according to any one of claims 1-4,
