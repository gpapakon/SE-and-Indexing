<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
fluid oscillators and more particularly to a low 
frequency hydrofluidic oscillator. Fluid oscillators utilizing fluidic amplifiers 
along with a piston housed in a fluid receiving chamber 
to provide output pulses or flows of fluid responsive to 
oscillation of the fluidic amplifier are known. For 
example, an hydrofluidic oscillator according to the preamble of claim 1 is shown in U.S. Patent No. 
3,124,999. Although the frequency of oscillation of the 
output signal can be changed such can only be 
accomplished by mechanically changing the length and 
mass of the piston or the spacing of the ports which are 
alternately covered and uncovered by movement of the 
piston. Other types of fluidic amplifier driven 
oscillators are controlled by mechanically opening or 
closing feedback passageways connected to the control 
ports of the fluidic amplifier. Such devices are shown 
in U.S. Patent No. 3,340,896.  
 Other types of structures are such as is shown 
in Re. 27,352 wherein tuned resonant devices such as 
tuned cavities control the frequency of the fluidic 
amplifier. Other pneumatic oscillators known to Applicant 
are those as shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,568,702 and U.S. 
Patent No. 3,682,042. In U.S. Patent No. 3,568,702, a 
pure fluidic oscillator is disclosed wherein the 
oscillator comprises three bistable fluid amplifiers 
with interconnecting R-C circuits and wherein the 
control signal pressure is applied to the oscillator 
through additional fluidic conditioning circuits which 
control the frequency range of the oscillator. In U.S. 
Patent No. 3,682,042, a motor suitable for driving 
reciprocatory stirrers or the like is directly driven by 
a bistable fluidic amplifier, the frequency of which is 
controlled by blocking a vent at the end of movement of 
a piston. Although each of the oscillators known to 
Applicant as above briefly described operate adequately 
for the purpose intended, none utilize a fluidic 
amplifier to drive a reciprocal valve to in turn provide 
an output fluid signal the frequency of which is 
adjustable and is in a low frequency range that is much 
lower than the natural frequency of the fluidic 
amplifier. An adjustable low frequency hydrofluidic 
oscillator as defined by the features of claim 1, the oscillator including a momentum exchange fluidic 
amplifier which drives a reciprocal valve means to 
provide discreet output fluid pulses. Reciprocation of 
the valve means is controlled by the simultaneous 
application of
