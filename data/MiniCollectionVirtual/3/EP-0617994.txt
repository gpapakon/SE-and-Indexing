<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and an apparatus for purifying gaseous fluids by separating out media present in these such as oils and dirt particles present in these. In order, on the one hand, to be able to clean without problem the separator surfaces (14, 16, 18, 20) and, on the other hand, to increase the separation efficiency, it is proposed that the gaseous fluid to be purified, before penetrating the separator surface (14, 16, 18, 20), is cooled and/or a gas or a liquid is sprayed into the fluid.
