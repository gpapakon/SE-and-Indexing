<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses synthetic peptides from 
autonomous parvoviruses, which are capable of inducing 

neutralizing antibodies against said viruses. 
These peptides correspond to antigenic sites located in 
the first 25 amino acids of the amino terminal end of the 

VP2 proteins of parvoviruses. When these peptides are 
coupled to carrier proteins or to other immunogenic 

complexes, they can be used in the formulation of 
vaccines appropriate to protect animals against the 

infection caused by said parvoviruses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chemically synthesized
viral peptides related to the major antigen (VP2) of the
autonomous parvovirus capsid and to assays and vaccines
using the said peptides. The said peptides can, for
instance, induce antibodies neutralizing for Canine
Parvovirus (CPV), mink enteritis virus (MEV) and Porcine
Parvovirus (PPV), whence they can be formulated in
vaccines and respectively confer total protection against
CPV, MEV and PPV in dogs, minks and pigs.Parvoviruses form a viral family having certain common
features (Cotmore et al., Adv. Virus Res. 33:91-174
(1987)). They are the smallest known DNA viruses. Their
genome is formed by a single stranded linear DNA molecule
having a length of some 5.0 kb enclosed within a proteic
capsid, being icosahedral in shape and having a size of
approximately 25 nm. Two large open reading frames (ORF)
are detected in the viral genome. The left ORF codes for
non-structural proteins involved in viral replication
whereas the right ORF codes for structural proteins
forming the viral capsid, which is constituted by VP1,
VP2 and VP3 proteins. The mRNA of both ORFs is
polyadenylated and 3'-coterminal. There are approximately
60 copies of VP2 in the viral capsid and approximately 10
copies of VP1 (Wobble et al., Biochemistry 23, 6565-6569,
1984) which may be arranged as either homo- or
heterodimers (Paradiso, J. Virol., 46, 94-102, 1983). The
VP2 protein contains all the antigenic determinants
involved in neutralizing the virus (López de Turiso et
al., J. Gen. Virol., 72, 2445-2456 (1991); Langeveld et
al., J. Virol., Vol. 67, No. 2, 765-772 (1993); López de 
Turiso et al., J. Virol., Vol. 66, No. 5, 2748-2753
(1991)).Autonomous parvoviruses are responsible for a large
number of diseases affecting human beings and animals of
interest alike and may indeed be fatal because of the
tendency of autonomous parvoviruses to replicate in
proliferating cerebellum, lymphoid tissue, intestinal
epithelium or foetal tissue cells. Among these autonomous
parvoviruses are CPV, MEV, PPV, bovine parvovirus (BPV),
goose parvovirus (GPV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV)
and B19 parvovirus which affects human beings.In this description the autonomous parvoviruses CPV and
PPV will be focussed on as an example. Some of the main
features of both parvoviruses are summarised hereinbelow.Within the genus of autonomous parvoviruses, CPV is a
member of the feline parvovirus subgroup. The other
members of this subgroup, very related each other, are
feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV)
