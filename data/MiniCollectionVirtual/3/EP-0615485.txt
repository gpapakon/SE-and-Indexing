<ABSTRACT>
A tool for the controlled tightening of bolts or other threaded objects comprises an arrangement that indicates when the turning moment attains a certain indication moment that is preset by displacing one of the ends of a spring (21), said end being displaced by rotating a screw (13) connected to the grip of the tool. The indication moment can be read off on a scale (31) on the tool's shaft (24), relative to a movable index (33) situated on a sleeve (30) which is actuated in relation to the grip by a thread (12) with a larger pitch than that of thread of the screw (13). The rotation of the grip (11) can be locked relative to the shaft (24) by a detachable handle (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
Tools for the controlled tightening of bolts and 
other threaded objects are often provided with an 
indication of when the turning moment has reached a 
predetermined value and include a spring whose force 
can be adjusted to a value corresponding to the 
intended indication moment, for instance by 
displacement of one of the ends of the spring when 
rotating the grip of the tool. Thereafter, the tool can 
be used to tighten several bolts with the same turning 
moment. For applications with particularly rigid safety 
regulations, for instance in aircraft industry, 
chemical or nuclear industry, there is a necessity to 
be able to adjust the spring force and the indication 
moment with a higher precision than what is normally 
possible with usual tools and to lock the tightening 
device of the spring so that the preset moment cannot 
change during work. The present invention relates to a 
tightening device for this purpose.  
 US-A-5 129 293 -corresponding to the preamble of claim 1-discloses 
a torque control 
mechanism for wrenches in which a pivot block has one 
end rockably engaging a force transmission member, an 
axially movable plunger has one end rockably opposing a 
second end of the pivot block, a ball screw carried by 
the plunger has a control ball element engaging the 
second end of the pivot block, a balance cam carried by 
the plunger provides seat for a coiled compression 
spring having its opposite end engaged by an 
antifriction device permitting the spring to turn for 
adjustment purposes, a rotatably adjustable transfer 
screw engages the antifriction device and is threaded 
through a stop adjusting nut mounted in the distal end 
portion of the tubular housing for the mechanism. The 
distal end portion of the transfer screw is secured in 
an end cap fixed within a distal end of a handle 
mounted on the housing. The components of the mechanism 
provide a continuous passage therethrough for 
respective adjustment wrenches to be applied from the 
handle end of the tool to respectively the ball screw, 
a ball screw lock screw, and to said balance cam. An embodiment of the tightening tool according 
to the present invention as defined in claim 1 will now be described with 
reference to figures 1 to 3. Figure 1 shows the exterior of a grip with a 
tightening device and the scales which are used when 
adjusting the indication moment. Figure 2 shows a length cross-section through the 
grip and the tightening device. Figure 3 shows the four units separately. The 
lower part of the tool is not

<CLAIMS>
A tightening device for springs in moment 
indicating tools comprising a shaft (24), a spring (21) 

situated in the shaft (24), an indication arrangement 
actuated by the force of the spring (21) that indicates 

when a turning moment on the tool attains a 
predetermined indication moment, a screw (13) for 

tightening the spring (21) by displacing one of its 
ends, a rotatable grip (11) connected with the screw 

(13) and at least one scale (31) for reading off the 
indication moment, the total indication moment being 

read on a longitudinal scale (31) in the direction of 
the shaft relative to a movable index (33), said 

longitudinal scale (31) being placed on the shaft (24) 
and said movable index (33) being actuated in relation 

to the grip (11) by a thread (12) in said grip,
characterized
 in that the displacement of 
said movable index (33) is considerably larger than the 

displacement of the end of the spring (21) and in that 
the thread (12) in the grip (11) is of the opposite 

direction in comparison to the thread of the screw (13) 
and has a considerably larger pitch. 
Tightening device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the movable index is positioned 

in the front end of a sleeve (30) that is concentrical 
with the grip (11) and that cooperates with the thread 

(12) of the grip with a threaded portion (34). 
Tightening device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the grip (11) can be prevented 

from rotating in relation to the shaft (24) by a 
locking mechanism situated in the grip, which locking 

mechanism can be actuated by a detachable handle (10).
