<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for effecting necrosis of a tissue lining of a mammalian body cavity, particularly a uterine endometrium, by introducing an applicator comprising a distendable bladder (5) connected to a catheter (10) into the uterus, distending the bladder by introducing a nontoxic fluid (25) under pressure, heating the fluid by means (44) located internal to the bladder to a temperature of 190  F to 215  F and preferably 210  F for period of four to twelve minutes and preferably six minutes and regulating said apparatus by means (30) located external to the uterus, thereby cauterizing substantially the entirety of the tissue lining, particularly the endometrium. An agitator (103) circulates the fluid within the distendable bladder to help keep the fluid at a uniform temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HEATED BALLOON MEDICAL APPARATUS WITH FLUID AGITATING MEANSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to an apparatus and a method for treating the tissue lining of a human body cavity, particularly the endometrium of the uterus. More specifically, the apparatus and method of the present invention provides improved treatment, e.g., cauterization of the endometrium of a mammalian uterus, without many of the disadvantages and dangerous features of known techniques.2. The Prior ArtThe following terms as used herein have the meaning given below:"Cauterization" means the application of heat to tissue in an amount sufficient to destroy the tissue. "Necrosis" means the death of cells in tissue. "Endometrium" is that portion of the inner lining of the uterus to which an embryo normally attaches and excludes the portions of the uterine inner lining forming the cervix, to which the embryo usually does not attach. Apparatus and methods for cauterization of the endometrium of a mammalian uterus, useful in steriliza.tion procedures and cancer treatments, are well known. T armal and cryogenic treatments have been utilized in such cauterization techniques and typically involve either the direct or indirect application of heat or cold to the tissue to be treated.For example, a laser hysteroscope has been used to cauterize the endometrial layer of the uterus. This laser 

treatment suffers from several disadvantages. It requires the application of an intense amount of thermal energy to a relatively small area of tissue even though such a large amount of heat may not be necessary to effectively cauterize the tissue. Further, this laser treatment requires the physician to continually reposition the laser used in the treatment within the uterus in order to treat the entire endometrium. Such internal manipulation of a laser hysteroscope within the uterus of a patient is both difficult, requiring a significant level of skill to perform, and potentially dangerous. Accidental puncture of the uterine or tissue wall may result from manipulation of the laser scope within the uterus or body cavity, and tissue layers beneath the endometrium may be burned if a laser's beam is left focused on one area of tissue for too long a period of time.A variety of alternatives to laser treatment in cauterizing the uterine endometrium are known. In U.S. Patent No. 3,924,628, Droegemueller et al. disclose a method and apparatus for necrosing tissue cells that utilizes an extendable bladder which is inserted in the
