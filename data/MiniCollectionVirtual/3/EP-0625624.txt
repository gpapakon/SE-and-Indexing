<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lock cylinder, in which the end faces of the tumbler pins (4) confronting one another in the opening position and the end faces of the associated counterpins (5) rest one on the other in a plane-parallel manner. It is thereby possible to fix the tolerance dimension (X) constructively, for example to set it at zero. It is consequently possible, furthermore, to design these pins with a larger diameter. As a result, the lock cylinder is burglar-proof, since the pins can be sheared off less easily or can no longer be sheared off at all. The cylinder plug (2) is provided on its outer surface (49), in the region of the tumbler pins (4), with a face extending parallel to its axis of rotation. Moreover, the different design of tumbler pins (4) and the possibility of their combined use afford an enormous increase in the lock combinations.

Method of setting lock combinations in cylinder locks, which are fitted 
with a cylinder case (1), in which is arranged a cylinder core (2) of circular 

cross-section with longitudinal profile in the key channel (27) for a 
flat key (8) with variable recesses at least on one wide face of the flat 

key (8) or the like, and with pin tumblers (4, 5) extending at right angles 
to the core longitudinal axis, which in each case are arranged in a row 

or in rows, and which comprise at least one core pin (4), opposite to 
which lie corresponding recesses in the flat key (8), where each core 

pin (4) is assigned a counter-pin (5), which is slidable against spring 
pressure, which in each case is slidable against spring pressure in a 

hole arranged in the cylinder case (1), where the core pins (4) and the 
counter-pins (5), in opening position, are arranged with in each case 

opposite surfaces on the locking plane of the lock, where the core pin 
and counter-pin (4, 5) are formed on the facing end surfaces (9, 10) in 

opening position of the cylinder lock, with surfaces (9, 10) lying flat on 
one another, perpendicular to a longitudinal centre axis (11) of the core 

pin (4) and of the counter-pin (5) which passes through the longitudinal 
axis of rotation, or that the core pin and counter pin (4, 5) are formed on 

the facing surfaces (9, 10) with, in opening position of the cylinder lock, 
convex-concave surfaces lying on one another to provide a form fit, and 

that the cylinder core (2) in the area of its hole accommodating the core 
pin (4) on its circumferential surface is provided with a straight surface 

(12) corresponding at least to the diameter of the core pin (4) running 
parallel to its longitudinal axis of rotation, 
characterized by
 the fact 
that the at least one core pin (4) is provided with at least one eccentric 

locking lug (14), which is set in each case to one of the variously 
possible positions for setting of the required lock permutation in 

peripheral direction of the core pin (4) and is secured in the position set 
to prevent rotation.
