A placement device operated by explosive powder forces, having a piston guide (2)
for a piston (1), which can be driven from a rear initial position into a front final

position by means of propellant gases of a propellant charge (5), having a cartridge
receiver (4) and having a housing part (6) which surrounds the piston guide (2) with

a radial spacing, wherein a channel which is connected to the cartridge receiver (4)
and which leads, via an opening (2c) in the piston guide (2), into the guide bore (2a)

for the piston (1), is provided between the piston guide (2) and the housing part (6),
which channel can be connected to the atmosphere by means of a closable passage

(3a), and a closable valve device (2b, 3b) is provided in the channel (7) for forming
a storage space which is closed in relation to the atmosphere and which comprises the

regions, on the sides in the direction of placement, of the channel (7) and of the guide
bore (2a), characterised in that the passage (3a) is disposed in a support (3) which

comprises the cartridge receiver (4), wherein the valve device (2b, 3b) can be closed
by an axial relative movement, opposite to the direction of placement, of the support

(3) in relation to the piston guide (2) which forms a closure part, and the passage (3a)
can be closed by an axial relative displacement, in the direction of placement, of the

support (3) in relation to the piston guide (2) which forms a closure part.
A placement device according to claim 1, characterised in that the channel (7) is
closed towards the cartridge receiver (4) by the piston (1) which is situated in its rear

initial position.
A placement device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the support (3)
and the housing part (6) are joined to form a unit which is axially displaceable in

relation to the piston guide (2).
