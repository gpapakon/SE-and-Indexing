<ABSTRACT>
A wireless data communication system is operable in a power 
saving mode wherein stations are synchronized to be in an awake state 

to receive synchronizing messages (TIM,PSYNC) and traffic indicator 
information and are changed to a doze state if they are not to receive 

data messages. In one embodiment all stations(20) communicate via a 
base station access point (16), which broadcasts synchronizing 

messages (TIM) at regular intervals identifying stations (20) that are to 
receive data messages. In another embodiment all stations (220) 

communicate directly with one another, one station assumes the role of 
a master station and broadcasts synchronizing messages (PSYNC), and 

stations (220) desiring to transmit data messages transmit traffic 
indicator messages (PTIM) to the appropriate destination stations (220), 

in a synchronized awake period just before the next synchronizing 
message (PSYNC) is expected to arrive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of operating a
wireless data communication system, and to wireless data
communication systems.A recent development in the field of local area networks (LANs)
has been the introduction of wireless communications in such networks.
Another development has been the introduction of portable, battery-operated
devices for use in such wireless networks.International Patent Application No. WO 92/19059 discloses a
wireless data communication system which includes a cable-based
network to which are attached controllers which maintain a portable
device in communication with the network for data transfer. The
portable unit transmits polling packets at regular intervals. Normally, a
response packet is received from the current controller. If no response
packet is received for a predetermined number of attempts the portable
unit initiates a procedure for registering with a new controller. The
portable unit is powered by a battery which supplies power to the unit's
transceiver and packet processor via a switch. Following transmission
of a polling packet, the portable unit remains fully active until a
response packet is received, or until the expiry of a predetermined time
period such as 10 milliseconds, and then operates the switch thereby
disabling battery current to the packet processor and transceiver for a
further predetermined time period, whereafter a new polling packet is
transmitted. This procedure effects a power-saving function. Initially,
the polling may be at a slow rate of about two second intervals, this rate
being doubled each time a response packet is received. When the
transmission rate is low, the polling rate is reduced, thereby reducing
requirements for battery current. The power saving function is thus
seen to be a complex procedure, involving the exchange of polling and
response packets for each individual station, which results in inefficient
use of the wireless communication medium. Furthermore, the two
seconds response time is inadequate for normal network operation at
current data rates. Thus, a 200 milliseconds interval is considered
appropriate to ensure uninterrupted communication under the typical
LLC (logical link control) layer protocols used in the majority of
contemporary LAN networks. These protocols typically utilize a time-out
timer having around 400 milliseconds duration, after which a 
transmitted packet is considered to have been lost. On expiry of such timer, the
protocols will attempt a recovery procedure by retransmitting the packet a limited
n

A method of operating a wireless data communication system
including a plurality of wireless stations (16, 20, 220), characterized by the steps of:

broadcasting synchronizing messages (TIM, PSYNC) from a selected one of said
stations (16,220-1); identifying which of a number of non-selected stations of the

plurality of stations (20,220-2 to 220-4) are to receive data messages by transmitting
traffic indicator information in association with said synchronizing messages from the selected station, wherein at least two non-selected

stations were identified in the identifying step; operating the non-selected stations
(20,220-2 to 220-4) in an awake state of relatively high power consumption during the

broadcast step and the identifying step; changing the operating state of non-selected
stations (20,220-2 to 220-4) that were not identified in the identifying step to a doze

state of relatively low power consumption after the broadcasting step and the
identifying step are performed; and maintaining all non-selected stations (20,220-2 to

220-4) that were identified in the identifying step in said awake state for at least a time
