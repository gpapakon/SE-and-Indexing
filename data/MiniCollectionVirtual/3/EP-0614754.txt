<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for producing coated thermoplastic articles,
preferably via coextrusion, wherein the coating layers contain selected bisbenzophenone
UV absorbers, and to the stabilized articles thus produced.The use of various types of UV absorbers in the stabilization of polymers is well known.
These stabilizers function by absorbing incident UV radiation and dispersing the absorbed
energy in a nondestructive manner. Concentration of the UV absorber near the surface of
the polymer to prevent penetration of UV light is, therefore, considered to be more
efficient and economical than dispersion of the UV absorber throughout the bulk of the
polymer.The protection of aromatic polycarbonates from UV light is a particular problem as the
polymer itself absorbs significant amounts of high energy light and is known to become
quickly yellow and hazy. Aside from their strength and toughness, polycarbonates derive
much of their value from their excellent optical properties, i.e. low color and high clarity.
Therefore, protection against UV radiation at the surface of a polymer like polycarbonate,
where most of the light would be absorbed, becomes vital.It is of course obvious that any color imparted to the polymer composition by the stabilizer
itself must be as little as possible.A number of methods have been developed to concentrate UV absorbers near or at the
surface of polymeric materials. These include surface impregnation (see U.S. Patent Nos.
3,309,220, 3,043,709, 4,861,664 and 4,937,026) and coating a plastic article with solutions
containing thermoplastic resins and UV absorbers (see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,668,588 and
4,353,965). Both techniques suffer from significant drawbacks including requiring
additional processing steps(i.e. applying, drying or curing), and encounter the difficulties
associated with the handling of large processed articles. An additional drawback, 
particularly relevant to polycarbonate sheet production, is the detrimental effect such post
addition treatment would have on the surface of the polymeric substrate.Coextrusion is a well recognized method of producing laminated thermoplastic materials
by simultaneously extruding various numbers of layers which form a single composite
material. U.S. Patent No. 4,540,623 describes coextruded materials of at least forty layers.
Other methods produce as few as two or three different layers.The resins employed in each layer may be the same or different e.g. polypropylene on
polyacrylate on polycarbonate or be different
