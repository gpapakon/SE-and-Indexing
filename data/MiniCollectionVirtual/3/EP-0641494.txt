<ABSTRACT>
A single quantum well II-VI laser diode without semiconductor cladding layers includes a pn junction formed by overlaying light-guiding layers (14, 16) of p-type and n-type ZnSe on an n-type GaAs substrate. A CdSe/ZnSe short-period strained-layer superlattice single quantum well active layer (12) is positioned between the guiding layers. An Au electrode (24) overlays the p-type guiding layer opposite the single quantum well active layer. The guiding layers have thicknesses which enable the substrate and Au electrode to confine the light beam generated by the device within the active layer and the guiding layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
Research undertaken by 3M in St. Paul, Minnesota, 
culminated in the demonstration of the world's first 
laser diodes fabricated from II-VI semiconductor 
materials. These devices emit coherent radiation at 
490 nm in the blue-green portion of the spectrum. They 
are disclosed generally in the Haase et al. article 
Short Wavelength II-VI Laser Diodes, Conference 
Proceedings for Gallium Arsenide and Related Compounds, 
1991 Institute of Physics Conference Series, No. 120, 
pp 9-16. There remains a continuing need for improved II-VI 
laser diode technology. For widespread commercial 
viability, the laser diodes must be relatively simple 
in construction and inexpensive to manufacture. The 
devices must also be capable of operation at relatively 
low voltages. Applied Physics Letters, 60 (1992), No. 17, Pages 2045-2047 
relates to blue and green diode lasers in ZnSe-based quantum 
wells. The investigated diodes comprise a multiple quantum 
well structure without cladding layers. The present invention as defined in claim 1 is a II-VI laser diode 
capable of efficiently generating high intensity beams 
of light at relatively low operating voltages. The 
device is relatively simple in construction and 
inexpensive to manufacture since it does not include 
semiconductor cladding layers for the primary purpose 
of confining the beam. In one embodiment, the laser diode includes a 
single crystal semiconductor substrate of a first 
conductivity type. A first guiding layer of II-VI 
semiconductor of the first conductivity type overlays 
the substrate. A single quantum well active layer of 
II-VI semiconductor overlays the first guiding layer. 
A second guiding layer of II-VI semiconductor of a 
second conductivity type overlays the active layer and 
forms a pn junction with the first guiding layer. A  
  
 
first electrode layer overlays the substrate opposite 
the first guiding layer, and a second electrode layer 
overlays the second guiding layer opposite the active 
layer. The first and second guiding layers have 
thicknesses enabling the substrate and second electrode 
to confine the beam of light within the active layer 
and the first and second guiding layers. In another embodiment, the substrate includes a 
GaAs substrate. The first and second guiding layers 
include ZnSe layers having combined thicknesses of 
about 3.5 µm. The active layer includes a CdSe/ZnSe 
short-period strained-layer superlattice layer. The 
second electrode is a Au electrode. Figure 1 is a cross sectional view (not to scale)
