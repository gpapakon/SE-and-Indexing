<ABSTRACT>
A fluid treatment apparatus and method for applying first and 
second fluids (e.g., etchant and water) to an article (e.g., 

circuit board) passing through the apparatus at a 
predetermined rate. The first fluid is impinged on a surface 

of the article (11) and thereafter collected within the 
apparatus' common housing (13). The second fluid is impinged 

onto the surface of the article and collected within the same 
housing but at a location separate from the collected first 

fluid so as to at least partially prevent mixing thereof. The 
preferred means for effecting fluid impingement comprises 

separate fluid injectors, each including at least two rows of 
fluid jet injectors (27) therein. The collected fluids are 

each returned to the respective impingement means (23, 41). 
Replenishment of the second fluid is accomplished using a pump 

which supplies the second fluid, while the apparatus also 
includes means (e.g., a drain) to effectively remove the 

second fluid at a rate similar to the supply rate for the 
second fluid. The first fluid is also maintained at an 

established level above the article's surface using suitable 
means (e.g., dual rollers) located relative (e.g., on opposite 

sides of) the first fluid impingement means. Similar level 
retention for the second fluid is also possible. Cascading of 

the collected second fluid is also defined, this occuring 
within the same housing chamber which serves to collect the 

first fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the treatment of articles with
fluids. More particularly, the invention relates to the
treatment of articles such as substrates adapted for
utilization in printed circuit boards or the like.In Serial Number (S.N.) 07/911,610, entitled "Fluid Treatment
Apparatus and Method" (inventors: S. L. Bard et al), there is
defined a fluid treatment apparatus and a method for treating
a substrate with a fluid wherein strategically positioned rows
of fluid jet injectors are used to assure that most of the
fluid from one of the rows passes in a direction substantially
opposite the direction of travel of the substrate being
treated to thereby overcome potential problems associated with
"fluid dragout" (passage of retained fluid from one station to
the next). The plenum housings having such fluid injectors of
this apparatus may be utilized in the present invention. This
application is thus incorporated herein by reference. S.N.
07/911,610 was filed on July 10, 1992.There are several types of fluid treatment apparatus known in
the art, including such apparatus for treating, e.g., etching,
printed circuit substrates. Examples of such apparatus are
described in U.S. Patents 4,270,317, 4,506,687, 4,985,111 and
5,076,885. In 4,270,317, to E. J. Kurie, there is defined an
apparatus for treating metal sheets passed continuously
through the apparatus wherein several successively positioned
treatment tanks or units are used. The primary purpose of
this apparatus is to rinse the metal sheets, using oppositely
positioned spray nozzles which are oriented at a predetermined 
angular relationship to the direction of sheet travel to
thereby maintain turbulent fluid flow against the sheet
during rinse. This apparatus is of substantially elongated
configuration, requiring use of significant space on the
manufacturing floor. In 4,506,687, to H. J. Rosch, there is
described an apparatus for etching and rinsing vertically
oriented printed circuit boards with the various treatment
stations located in successive, adjacent orientation,
resulting in an overall apparatus of substantially elongated
configuration. Like the apparatus in 4,270,317, this
apparatus also mandates use of significant space on the
manufacturing floor. U.S. Patent 4,985,111 to K. F. G.
Ketelhohn, like 4,506,687, is also concerned with the
treatment of printed circuit board substrates and utilizes
angularly dispositioned spray nozzles to impinge the
substrates at predetermined angles in order to prevent
puddling or the like at certain locations on
