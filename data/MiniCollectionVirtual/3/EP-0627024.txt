A washing process for institutional laundries in 
which different detergents are introduced into the liquor 

in the same wash cycle, but at different stages of the 
washing process, characterized in that detergents or 

bleaches which emit fluorescence radiation in different 
wavelength ranges on exposure to light are used, in that 

light is transported by optical fibers to measuring 
points in the wash liquor, the light emitted there is 

collected and is delivered by the same optical fiber or 
by a second optical fiber to a receiving and evaluation 

unit which detects the intensities of the fluorescence 
radiation in one or more of the different wavelength 

ranges and determines the concentration of the detergents 
or bleaches in the wash liquor via a calibration effected 

with the detergents or bleaches used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the concentration of a detergent is determined from 

the fluorescence radiation which is emitted from the 
optical brighteners present in the detergent. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the concentration of a detergent is determined 

from the fluorescence radiation emitted by alkyl benzenesulfonate 
present in the detergent. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, where the process is used in continuous 

or cycle-dependent batch washing machines, the 
concentration is measured at several measuring points, 

the optical fibers associated with the measuring points 
being connected by a reversing switch to a single light 

source and a single receiving and evaluation unit. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the detergent or bleach is introduced 

into/regenerated in the bleach, the introduction 
of the detergent or bleach being controlled by a control  

 
system which compares with the actual concentration 

determined with a pre-set concentration. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that rinsing is terminated when the actual concentration 

determined has fallen below a pre-set concentration.
