<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of recombinant DNA 
technology. The invention provides a process for the production 
of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is known to catalyze 
several chemical reactions of amino acids in microorganisms, 
plants and animals. SHMT enzymatic reactions include cleavage, 
condensation, transamination, and racemization reactions (Schirch, 
L., 1982, Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 53:83 and Schirch 
et al., 1968, J. Biol. Chem. 243:5651.) The natural biological 
roles of SHMT involve the transfer of one-carbon units to glycine 
or from serine and the retroaldol cleavage of 1-amino-2-hydroxy 
acids such as threonine and allo-threonine to generate an aldehyde 
and glycine. One of the sources of SHMT is Escherichia coli. The SHMT 
enzyme is the product of the E. coli glyA gene. 
Stauffer et al., 1981, Gene 14:63-72, describe the cloning of the 
glyA gene which encodes SHMT in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide 
sequence for the glyA gene has been determined and the amino acid 
sequence for the SHMT enzyme 
has been proposed by Plamann et al., 1983, Nucleic Acid Research 
11:2065-2075. The glyA gene has been overexpressed in E. coli 
host cells at a level 17-26 fold over the wild type and the 
overproduced enzyme has been isolated and purified (Shirch et al., 
1985, J. Bacteriol. 163(1):1-7). However, this level of SHMT 
production is not commercially practical for large scale enzymatic 
processes which employ high concentrations of SHMT. When producing SHMT at high levels, it would be advantageous 
to allow production of the SHMT enzyme in soluble and active form, 
attributes that would provide for ease in the purification of the 
protein. However, many proteins that are expressed at high levels 
in Escherichia coli are often produced in granular form. These 
proteins are inactive and must be taken through a costly and time 
consuming process which solubilizes and refolds the protein in  
 
proper conformation prior to use. The present invention provides 
a recombinant DNA process for preparing ultrahigh levels of 
Escherichia coli SHMT in Escherichia coli cells in soluble and 
active form. The present invention provides a process for preparing an 
ultrahigh amount of Escherichia coli SHMT in soluble and active 
form within an E. coli host cell, said method comprising: 
a) Transforming the E. coli host cell with a recombinant DNA 
expression vector comprising: 
i) a transcriptional activating sequence; ii) a translational
