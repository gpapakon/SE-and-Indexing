<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and 
global positioning inertial navigation systems (GPS/INS), and more particularly, to a 
method of providing range measurements that uses the SAR and GPS/INS systems to 
measure the velocity of radar wave propagation at the same time that the range time 
lapse to a designated map pixel is measured, thereby improving measurement accuracy. A synthetic aperture radar is able to provide a precise measurement of the round 
trip elapsed radar wave propagation time from an aircraft location to a target location. 
The accuracy of this range measurement is affected by the accuracy to which the 
velocity of radar wave propagation in the atmosphere is known. Atmospheric 
conditions affect the radar wave propagation velocity to 0.03 percent and more. Since 
the prime use of the synthetic aperture radar system is to penetrate cloudy weather 
under variable atmospheric conditions, the accuracy of the radar wave propagation 
velocity measurement is an important factor. In measuring range to the target using the 
synthetic aperture radar system the round trip propagation time (T) of the radar wave is 
measured and the range is calculated as CT/2, where C is the radar wave propagation 
velocity. The value of C can vary as a function of altitude, humidity, clouds, and other 
attributes of weather. At 50 nautical miles, error due to the atmosphere can be 100 feet 
or more. Therefore, in view of the above, it is an objective of the present invention to 
provide for a range measurement method for use with a synthetic aperture radar system 
that improves target location accuracy.  
 The present invention is a method that provides precise target location 
measurement using a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) jointly with a global positioning 
inertial navigation system (GPS/INS) located on a moving aircraft. The synthetic 
aperture radar provides a precise measurement of the round trip elapsed radar wave 
propagation time from the aircraft location to a selected pixel in a ground map that 
includes a portion of the target. The velocity of radar wave propagation is measured 
after two range tune lapses to the designated map pixel are measured. When combined 
with position and velocity information derived from the GPS/INS inertial navigation 
system, the radar wave propagation time is used to calculate the position of the target 
pixel in GPS/INS coordinates, thereby improving measurement accuracy. More particularly, the present invention is a method
