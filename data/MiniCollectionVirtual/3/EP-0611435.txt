<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for detecting whether the level of an electrical signal having a preselected polarity is above a preselected value, is powered by DC of the opposite polarity. This prevents current leakage within the detector (20) circuit from simulating the level of the electrical signal. Such a circuit is particularly suited for detecting the current level provided by a flame sensor in a combustion control system. The preferred embodiment has a capacitor (55) which is charged by the circuit and then discharged by the electrical signal. The time required to discharge the capacitor (55) to a preselected level indicates the level of the electrical signal. A second embodiment uses a comparator (42) in a feedback loop which allows sensing the level of a voltage outside of the voltage range defined by the comparator's (42) power supply.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a high reliability signal sensing circuit
particularly suited for use as an electronic flame sensing circuit forming a part of a
burner control apparatus. The invention is described with specific reference to such a
flame sensing use, but other applications for use of the invention undoubtedly exist as
well. Generally, a flame sensing circuit includes a sensor element physically located
close to the site of the flame so as to provide a sensor signal having a predetermined
level or operating state when a flame is present and some other level or operating state
when flame is not present. The signal supplied directly by the sensor may by its level
indicate the level of ultraviolet or infrared radiation produced by the flame when
present, or may directly sense presence of the hot flame gasses. Typically, there is a
processing or detector circuit which receives the sensor signal, which is usually in an
analog format, and converts it into a signal which has a form usable by the burner
control or other apparatus basing its operation on the sensor signal. The processing or
detector circuit may be located relatively close to the flame, and connected to the
flame sensor.One typical type of flame sensor is generally referred to as a flame rod,
and uses the inherent capability of the ionized particles created by a flame to conduct
current between conductors placed in the flame. In a preferred embodiment of such a
device, the two conductors are the flame rod conductor of relatively small area and
the burner itself of relatively large area. The difference in areas creates a rectifier
effect in the conduction of an AC voltage placed between the flame rod and the
burner. Because the burner is relatively larger than the flame rod, the rectifier
formed by them produces a negative DC voltage. There is no theoretical reason why
the burner cannot be physically smaller than the flame rod, but practical
considerations dictate the opposite, so that the flame current generated by a flame rod
may be considered for the discussion following as negative. However, the principles
of the invention is equally applicable for a positive sensor signal.It is important that such sensors and the circuits with which they
operate be extremely reliable in detecting presence of flame, since whenever flame is
not present it is of paramount importance that fuel flow to the burner be immediately
stopped, and in the case of a pilot flame, not be started. It is of course inconvenient
if the sensing circuit indicates absence
