<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst carriers for the polymerization of an olefin, such as ethylene, are formed by reacting, in a single reaction step, an organomagnesium compound, an alkoxy silane, and a chlorinating reagent. From these catalyst carriers, catalyst components are produced by reaction with titanium tetrachloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst carrier in the form of solid 
particle which has attractive properties as the carrier portion of a 
catalyst component for olefin polymerization. In general, it is 
desired that the carrier of a catalyst for olefin polymerization have 
a relatively large particle size and a relatively narrow particle size 
distribution which are characteristics that are particularly sought in 
catalysts for use in gas phase polymerizations. It is known to 
polymerize alpha olefins, such as ethylene, using a catalyst component 
comprising titanium on magnesium halide or magnesium alkoxide support, 
the component being obtained by either copulverization or by direct 
reaction with a liquid titanium compound containing halogen. Such a 
component is then used in the polymerization reaction with a 
trialkylaluminum cocatalyst, e.g., triisobutylaluminum. In U.S. Patent No. 5,063,188 
a catalyst component for ethylene 
polymerization (including copolymerization) is formed by first 
reacting an organomagnesium compound with an alkoxysilane to replace 
the organo groups on the organomagnesium compound with alkoxy to 
yield a product comprising magnesium alkoxide (e.g., magnesium 
ethoxide), followed by contacting the resulting product with 
chlorinating agent (e.g., silicon tetrachloride) and then liquid 
titanium halide. In such a procedure, the magnesium alkoxide product 
from the first step is produced in the form of a gel-like solid which 
is isolated and washed prior to the later reaction steps. It has been  
 
found that such a procedure, although producing a useful product, 
yields a catalyst component which has a somewhat smaller than desired 
particle size and a wider than desired particle size distribution than 
desired for some commercial embodiments. The inventors have studied and found that the particle size of the 
aforementioned catalyst component can be varied by changing the ratio 
of the reaction components which include silicon halide, alkoxy 
silicon compound, and organomagnesium and that the aforementioned 
problems regarding particle size and particle size distribution of the 
catalyst component resulting from the isolation of the magnesium 
alkoxide intermediate can be avoided if the process of U.S. Patent No. 
5,063,188 is modified by reacting the organomagnesium compound, alkoxy 
silane, and chlorinating reagent in a single step. The organomagnesium compound which can be used in the present 
invention is a dialkylmagnesium compound having from one to 
eight carbon
