<ABSTRACT>
A brake device comprises a stack of friction plates 
(6,7) compressible to have a braking effect between an 

armature (9) and a magnet structure 10, the structure 
including a permanent magnet (11) urging the armature towards 

the magnet structure to effect braking, and an electromagnet 
(12) energizable to augment the effect of the permanent 

magnet, or to oppose it either partially or completely so as 
to release the braking effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrically controllable 
brake device. In accordance with the invention, an electrically 
controllable brake device comprises braking means responsive 
to an electromagnet which can be selectively energized so as 
to produce a braking force dependent on the energization, and 
also to a permanent magnet. The permanent magnet provides a braking force which will 
persist in the event of failure of the supply energizing the 
electromagnet. The presence of the permanent magnet does not 
derogate from the control available by means of the 
electromagnet because this can be energized so as either to 
augment or to oppose the braking force due to the permanent 
magnet. By energizing the electromagnet to provide a 
magnetic flux equal and opposed to that of the permanent 
magnet, the brake device can be held in the released 
condition, from which an increasing brake force can be 
obtained by either increasing the electromagnet energization 
so that the brake force is due solely to the electromagnet, 
or by decreasing the energization, until this reaches zero, 
when only the permanent magnet is operative. From this 
condition, an immediate increase in brake force can be 
obtained by energizing the electromagnet with reversed 
polarity so as to add to the effect of the permanent magnet. The braking means can conveniently comprise interleaved 
friction plates, some held against rotation relative to a 
frame mounting member, and the others being arranged to 
rotate with a shaft to be braked. The stack of friction 
plates is received between a fixed magnet structure, 
including the permanent magnet and the electromagnet, and an 
armature which can be magnetically attracted to the magnet 
structure and which is movable along the shaft axis, as are  
 
the friction plates, so as to compress the plates together, 
to effect braking, or to allow them to separate, to release 
the brake device. A single friction plate could be employed 
in place of the plate stack. The invention will thus be seen to provide a brake 
device which can be effectively electrically controlled but 
which reliably applies a braking force in the event of power 
failure. The invention is further described below, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a sectional side view of an electrically 
controllable brake device embodying the invention; Figures 2 & 3 are respectively axially and edge views of 
a friction plate employed in the brake device of Figure 1;
