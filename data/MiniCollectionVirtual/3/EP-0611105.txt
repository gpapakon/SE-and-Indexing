<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a current source
which can be used in, for example, bipolar semiconductor
integrated circuits.Recently, the semiconductor integrated circuits
have been used in a variety of portable electronic
equipments. Most of the portable electronic equipments
have a battery for the power supply. The voltage
between the terminals of the battery decreases as it
repeatedly supplies its power. Even under this
voltage-changing power supply, use of a current source
which does not change its preset current has assured the
performances of many portable electronic apparatus.The current source of this kind, as disclosed
in the JP-A-60-191508, has a current mirror which is
formed of first to third transistors of the same
polarity and transistors of the opposite polarity, and
resistors. In this case, the base current of the third
transistor is set at a proper value in order to equalize
the collector-emitter voltages Vce of the first and
second transistors which are used for the reference to
the current setting, and also to make their collector
currents equal. Thus, the value of the current from
this current source is not affected by the voltage
change of the power supply, the temperature dependency 
of the current amplification factors hfe of the
transistors and the dispersion between production lots.The arrangement of such current source will be
described with reference to Fig.7. Referring to Fig.7,
there are shown NPN transistors 1, 2, 3 and 8. The
first transistor 1 has an emitter area equivalent to N
second transistors 2 connected in parallel. There are
also shown resistors 4 and 332, which are connected to
the emitters of the first and third transistors 1 and 3,
respectively. The collector current of the third
transistor 3 flows to an input end of a current mirror
530 which is formed of PNP transistors 531 through 535.
The collector current Ic531 of the transistor 531 flows
in the opposite direction to the collector of the first
transistor 1 of diode configuration as the first output
current. Similarly, the collector current Ic532 of the
transistor 532 flows to the collector of the second
transistor 2 as the second output current, and the
collector current Ic535 of the transistor 535 to the
collector of the transistor 8 of diode configuration, or
a load as the third output. There are also shown a
phase compensation capacitor 7 for negative feedback
stabilization, a resistor 333 through which a current
necessary for starting flows, and a power supply 9.The operation of this conventional
