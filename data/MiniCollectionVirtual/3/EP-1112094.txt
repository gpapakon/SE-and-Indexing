<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to medical implants, comprising a support that is coated with a polymer or a mixture of polymers, characterized in that the polymer mixture contains a polycyanacrylic acid ester or a polymethylene malonic acid ester. The invention also relates to the use of polymers made from cyanacrylates and/or methylene malonic acid esters for coating medical devices and implants for the prevention of cell proliferation.

<CLAIMS>
Stent which consists of a support coated with a
polymer or a polymer mixture, 
characterized in
that
 the polymer mixture contains a
polycyanoacrylic acid ester or a polymethylene

malonic acid ester.
Stent according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the support consists of metal or a polymer.
Stent according to either of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the coating contains
polymers of cyanoacrylate butyl ester.
Stent according to either of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 the coating consists of
polycyanoacrylic acid ester and at least one

further polymer.
Stent according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that

substances which influence the degradation of the
polymer are contained in the polymer coating.
Stent according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that

the coating contains calcium carbonate.
Stent according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that

at least one of these further polymers originates 
from one of the following substance groups:

proteins (in particular albumin, gelatin,
fibrinogen, fibrin, hirudin, heparin, collagen or

immunoglobulins) and their derivatives (in
particular crosslinked polypeptides, conjugates of

proteins with polyethylene glycols and other
polymers), pseudopolyamino acids, starch, or

starch derivatives, chitin, chitosan, pectin,
polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid,

polyhydroxybutyric acid, polyester,
polycarbonates, polyamides, polyphosphazenes,

polyvinyl alcohol, polyamino acids, poly-Îµ-caprolactone,
polyorthoester, polyurethanes,

polyurea, polyethylene terephthalate, and
polymethylene malonic acid ester.
Stent according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that

the applied polymer layer contains at least one
softener.
Stent according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that

the softener is a nonionic surfactant, in
particular nonylphenoxy polyethylene oxide,

octoxynol or poloxamers.
Sterile solution of a polymer mixture in a special
incubation vessel for the production of stents

according to one of Claims 1 to 9.
Use of polymers of cyanoacrylates and/or methylene
malonic acid esters for coating stents.
Process for the production of stents according to
Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the stent support
is immersed in a solution containing polymers of

cyanoacrylate and/or methylene malonic acid ester,
and is then withdrawn from this solution.
Process according to Claim 12, 
characterized in
that
, in addition to the polymers of cyanoacrylate 
and/or methylene malonic acid ester, the solution

contains further polymers.
