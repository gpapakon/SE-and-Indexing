<ABSTRACT>
Improved crop yields are obtained by determining total dissolved solids (TDS) in a representative sample of transplants to determine strike rate as a logarithmic function of TDS before transplanting. Juvenile plants with high strike rate readings are transplanted. A refractometer having a logarithmic scale showing low medium and high strike rates as a direct readout from a juice sample is used. A bioregulator can be used to induce high TDS levels prior to transplanting. Particular application is to transplanting strawberry runners.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to an improved crop and to a process for reducing
plant losses or enhancing plant recovery following stress related procedures,
including but not limited to transplanting or pruning procedures.The success of ventures involving commercial use of plants including fruiting
plants involves risks. Risks arise as a consequence of many variables. These
include inter alia, the weather, unexpected climatic variations, the quality of juvenile
plants and timing of artificially induced events, such as planting in relation to
anticipated seasonal events and so forth. Many of these variables cannot be
quantified and where, for example, planting takes place too late or too early and say,
anticipated seasonal changes do not occur as hoped, or adverse weather interferes
with events, the yield from a crop can be adversely effected. A venture can become
unprofitable.It is known that yield can be improved in mature plants by a process known
as pruning. While the yield of the pruned plant compared to the unpruned plant is
increased, the yield is not necessarily maximised because the yield depends on the
plant's recovery from pruning induced stress. Similarly, where juvenile plants are
transplanted, particularly where commercial numbers are concerned, plant losses
occur as some plants cannot recover from the transplanting procedure. Moreover,
recovery rates in a transplantation can be slow and this in turn can also effect
overall yield. These problems are exacerbated in the large scale commercial
environment as a 20% or even 10% reduction in yield from year to year can mean
the difference between profit and loss.At present, conditions considered appropriate to application of induced stress
such as pruning or transplanting are evaluated on a qualitative basis having regard
to, inter alia, season and visual appearance of plants. The applicant has found that
the latter test can be deceptive inasfar as assessing a plant's ability to withstand
artificially induced stresses, particularly those associated with transplanting. The Soviet patent specification SU-A-1561900 and European patent specification EP-A-0215399
describe methods by which healthy plants are identified for the purpose of
determining a plant's susceptibility to various kinds of stress. The applicants' discovery
has shown that the methods used in these prior patent specifications can be misleading
due to the applicants' discovery of a very narrow range during which a plant is prone
to switch from a high stress tolerance phase to a low stress
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for reducing plant loss or enhancing plant recovery after subjecting
a plant to artificially induced stress such as transplanting operations, pruning

operations or the like, the process comprising the steps of:-

(a) prior to subjecting the plant to the artificially induced stress, quantitatively
confirming that the plant is in a relatively high stress tolerance phase by determining

the plants energy reserves according to a measurable internal characteristic of said
plant, said measurable internal characteristic being in said

relatively high stress tolerance phase; and
(b) subsequently subjecting the plant to the artificially induced stress before said
plant centres 
a relatively low stress tolerance phase.
A process according to claim 1 when used as a culling process for eliminating
a high proportion of plants having relatively low stress tolerance from a plurality of

independent plant populations, each plant population comprising a plurality of plants
which are of the

same production lot from a specific source, the culling process comprising the steps
of:-


(a) selecting a representative sample of plants from each population;
(b) quantitatively ascertaining whether said representative sample of plants is in a
relatively low stress tolerance phase or a relatively high stress tolerance phase by

determining the plants' energy reserves according to the said measurable internal
characteristic of said plants in said sample, said measurable internal characteristic

being indicative of the plants' tolerance to stress; and
(c) subsequently culling those populations of plants that correspond to the
representative sample of plants which have been ascertained as being in a relatively

low stress tolerance phase.
A process according to claim 1 used repeatedly for preparing and selecting
plants suitable for being subjected to artificially induced stress such as transplanting

or pruning, the process including the steps of:-

(a) selecting a representative sample of plants from a plant population, the plants
of which are related to the same source;
(b) quantitatively ascertaining whether said plants in said representative sample are 
in a relatively high stress tolerance phase or a relatively low stress tolerance phase by

determining the plants' energy reserves according to a measurable internal
characteristic of said plants in said sample, said measurable internal characteristic

being indicative of said plants being in a relatively low or a relatively high stress
tolerance phase;
(c) where said plants in said sample are shown to be in a relatively low stress
tolerance phase, select all said plants in said population as being substantially stress

intolerant and set them aside as being unsuitable to be subjected to said artificially
induced stress, and
(d) where said population has been shown to be in a relatively
low stress tolerance phase then subject said population to a process adapted to

artificially induce a relatively high stress tolerance phase in said stress intolerant
population;
(e) subsequently select a further representative sample from said population that
has been subjected to said process adapted to artificially induce a relatively high stress

tolerance phase;
(f) quantitatively ascertain whether said plants in said further representative sample
have reached an induced relatively high stress tolerance phase according to a

measurable internal characteristic of said plants in said further representative sample,
said measurable internal characteristic being indicative of a plant being in a relatively

high or relatively low stress tolerance phase; and
(g) where said plants in said further sample are shown to be in a relatively high
stress tolerance phase select all said plants in said population as having been

successfully artificially induced into a relatively high stress tolerance phase as being
substantially stress tolerant and set them aside as being suitable to be subjected to said

artificially induced stress.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the measurable characteristic is a
measure of the total dissolved solids in a plant juice sample.
The culling process according to claim 2 wherein the measurable characteristic
is a measure of the total dissolved solids in a plant juice sample.
The process according to claim 3 wherein the measurable characteristic is a
measure of the total dissolved solids in a plant juice sample. 
The process according to claim 1 wherein said measurable characteristic
indicative of the plant being in said relatively high stress tolerance phase is determined

according to a predetermined logarithmic relationship between the measurable
characteristic and the plant's likelihood to recover from the stress.
The process according to claim 2 wherein the measurable internal
characteristics indicative of the plant's tolerance to stress is determined according to

a predetermined logarithmic relationship between the measurable characteristic and the
plant's likelihood to recover from stress and said plants culled in step (c) have been

ascertained as being in a relatively low stress tolerance phase as measured by the said
logarithmic relationship.
The process according to claim 3 wherein the stress tolerance phase of said
plants is determined by comparing the said measured internal characteristic with a

predetermined logarithmic relationship the measured internal characteristic
and the plant's likelihood to recover from stress.
The process according to claim 3 wherein step (e) comprises applying a
bio-regulator at periodic intervals until said plants read an induced relatively high

stress tolerance phase as measured by a predetermined logarithmic relationship
between the measured internal characteristic and the plant's likelihood to recover from

stress.
