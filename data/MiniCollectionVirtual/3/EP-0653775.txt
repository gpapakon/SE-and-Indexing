<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a microwave 
plasma processing apparatus suited for generating a 

plasma by using microwaves and a processing method. 
Microwaves propagated through a circular waveguide are 

tuned in the space thereof by a microwave tuning means 
that is installed to match the impedance, and are 

introduced in a uniform and most efficient state into 
a discharge block having a plasma-resistant inner 

surface that is enlarged in a tapered form through a 
microwave introduction window. Then, a processing gas 

controlled to a predetermined pressure by a gas 
feeding means and an evacuating means is turned into a 

plasma which is more uniform and is more dense by 
interaction of a microwave electric field that is 

efficiently introduced and a magnetic field produced 
by a solenoid coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microwave plasma processing apparatus
and a processing method according to the preambles of claims 1 and 11.More particularly, it relates to a microwave plasma processing apparatus and
a processing method which are well suited for generating a plasma by use
of microwaves and subjecting samples such as semiconductor device substrates,
etc., to a plasma processing such as an etching process, a film
forming process, etc.A conventional microwave plasma processing apparatus and method are
known from EP-A-0 478 283 which discloses a diaphragm having a microwave
matching function, positioned in a circular waveguide, whereupon the
matching is established by regulating the aperture of the diaphragm.From EP-A-0 115 970 it is known that slit plates in a circular waveguide
could be used to form a uniform plasma. Other microwave plasma processing
apparatus are known from EP-A-0 264 913, EP-A-0 460 690 and US-A-5,006,192.As a further conventional microwave plasma processing apparatus, the one
disclosed in, for example, Japanese patent laid-open no. 133322/1992 is
known. The apparatus is such that the waveguide has a nearly cylindrical 
shape, a discharge chamber connected to the waveguide via a gas-tight
microwave transmission window is formed into a discharge block made of
a hollow cylindrical electrically conductive material that is enlarged in a
taper in the direction in which the microwaves travel, and a plasma of a
high density is generated by the interaction of a magnetic field generated in
a discharge chamber by an air-core coil provided on the outside of the
discharge block and a microwave electric field introduced into the discharge
chamber via the waveguide, in order to enhance uniformity of the processing.The above-mentioned prior art, however, does not pay attention to the mode
of the microwaves introduced into the discharge chamber, the plasma
resistance of the inner wall of the discharge chamber, and change in the
process characteristics during continuous processing. That is, attention has
not been paid sufficiently to introduction of the lines of electric force of
microwaves propagated through the waveguide into the discharge chamber
and, besides, the uniformity of plasma and the plasma generation efficiently
are not satisfactory. According to the prior art, furthermore, the discharge
block is made of a non-magnetic electrically conductive material such as
aluminum. When the material to be is of Al or an Al alloy, a halogen
gas is used as the etching gas. When such a
