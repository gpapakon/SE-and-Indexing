of formula (I) according to Claim 1, which comprises 

the following stages:

and conversion to 

the potassium salt to give potassium (RS)-1-(3-nitrophenyl)ethanesulphonate, 
b) conversion of the potassium salt obtained in a) into 
a mixture of the A and B forms of benzylquininium 

1-(3-nitrophenyl)ethanesulphonate, separation of the 
A form and recovery of a mixture enriched in the B 

form, 
c) conversion of the benzylquininium salt, enriched in 
the B form, obtained in b) into potassium 1-(3-nitrophenyl)ethanesulphonate,

Process according to one of Claims 3 to 
10, for which, in stage c), the phenylglycinol salt is 

obtained by the action of (R)-(-)-phenylglycinol in the 
presence of an acid, in an aqueous medium, at a temperature 

of between 10°C and 30°C. 
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 
11, for which, in stage c), the conversion to an alkylammonium
