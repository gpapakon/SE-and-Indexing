<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printing machine having a roller platten (3) and a print head (4) which is assigned to the latter and has a support (5), which can be pressed against the roller platten (3), and a spring base (6), at least one compression spring (7) being connected between the spring base (6) and the support (5), at least the spring base (6) being mounted rotatably on a bearing pin (2) which is preferably parallel to the roller platten (3), and an interlock member (12) which is connected in terms of torque to the bearing pin (2) engaging in its interlock position in a catch receiver (20) of the spring base (6). To adjust the position of the print head (4), it is recommended that an azimuthally adjustable adjusting piece on which the interlock member (12) is mounted be attached to the free end of the bearing pin (2).
