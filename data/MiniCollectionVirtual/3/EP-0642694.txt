<ABSTRACT>
A drive belt (18) for use in a tape cartridge (10) including a drive belt wound around a drive roller (20), two guide rollers (22, 24), and a tape pack (17). The belt has a coating (42) on the face of the belt that contacts the rollers. The coating includes carbon black and aluminum oxide particles dispersed in a polymeric binder. The coating on the belt is electrically conductive and has a resistivity of less than 400 ohm-cm. The coated belt minimizes wear on the rollers, voltage buildup, and electrical discharge within the cartridge. This reduces the number of transient errors that occur when reading and writing the tape (16). The tape cartridge may also include a metal pin (36) that contacts the coated face of the belt, thereby providing improved tape tension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an improved belt for a belt-driven tape
cartridge such as that disclosed in US-A-44 66 564.In the cartridge of US-A-44 66 564, magnetic recording tape is driven
by a thin, continuous, flexible, pretensioned belt which in turn is driven by a
single reversible drive motor that provides rapid acceleration and deceleration of
the recording tape in either direction. In this known cartridge, the belt is wound
around, and therefore exerts pressure on, a belt drive roller, a pair of belt guide
rollers, and a tape pack formed by winding the magnetic tape on a pair of tape
hubs.The belt-driven tape cartridge according to US-A-44 66 564
includes a drive belt comprising a substrate with an inner
major surface for contacting the belt-guide rollers and an
outer major surface for contacting the tape windings on
the tape hubs. The outer surface of the substrate is
provided with discontinuities promoting the release of air
from between the belt and the underlying tape. The
discontinuities are formed through particles dispersed in
a polymeric binder coated on the outer surface of the
drive belt.JP-A-3093032 discloses some possible particle materials
for a belt-driven tape in order to improve its durability. Over the life of a cartridge, the belt can cause wear at the surface of the
drive roller and guide rollers. As the belt erodes the surface of the rollers, tiny
particles from the rollers are released into the cartridge. These particles can
interfere with the ability to read or write on the magnetic tape by creating
"transient errors." Transient errors are non-repeating errors, i.e. the error will not
always recur at the same spot when a given portion of magnetic tape passes the
tape head for a second time. Transient errors are more troublesome than
permanent errors because there is currently no known mechanism for compensating
for them.Transient errors may also be caused by electrostatic discharge within the
cartridge. Electrostatic discharge is caused by triboelectric effects which result
from rubbing two electrically insulating surfaces together. In a cartridge, the drive
belt rubs against the drive roller, guide rollers, and tape pack, which creates a
build-up of electricity. This build-up may continue until it reaches a high enough
potential, at which point the electricity is discharged. This electrical discharge
may cause noise in the electronic read amplifier circuit, producing an error in
reading or recording on the magnetic tape. Such a build-up of voltage within the
cartridge
