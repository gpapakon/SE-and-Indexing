<ABSTRACT>
In a digital transmission system comprising a transmitter (2) connected to 
a receiver (6) through a channel (4), this receiver comprises an equalizer (8) which 

includes an equalization filter (12) with output signals from which a sum weighted with 
weight factors is determined. The output signal of the equalizer is applied to a detector. 
According to the inventive idea a correction signal for correcting the 
coefficients 
w
 of the equalizer is derived from 

where 
k
 is 
the vector of a plurality of successive detected symbols, and e
k
 is a difference between 
the current input signal of the detector and a reconstructed ideal input signal of the 

detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a digital transmission system comprising a
transmitter coupled to a receiver through a channel, the receiver comprising an
equalizer for deriving a detection signal from an input signal of the receiver, a detector
for deriving the detected symbols from the detection signal, and the equalizer
comprising an equalization filter for deriving at least two equalization signals,
combining means for determining the detection signal which is a combination of
equalization signals weighted with weight factors, the equalizer also including adapting
means for adapting the weight factors in response to a correction signal belonging to a
specific weight factor which correction signal is derived from a first auxiliary signal
associated to the detection signal and from a second auxiliary signal associated to a
detected symbol.The invention likewise relates to a receiver for such a system.A system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from the journal
article "Techniques for Adaptive Equalization of Digital Communication Systems" by
R.W. Lucky in The Bell System Technical Journal, February 1966.Transmission systems of this type may be used, for example, for
transferring digital symbols through the public telephone network or for reconstructing
digital symbols coming from a magnetic tape or disc.When digital symbols are transmitted via a transmission medium or stored
on a recording medium, the symbols to be transmitted or recorded respectively, are
converted into analog pulses which are fed to the transmission medium or recording
medium respectively, further to be referenced by the term of channel.Generally, the analog pulses are provided not to overlap in time. If the
channel has a limited bandwidth, the pulses will start to overlap which will often lead to
the fact that a signal received at a specific instant does not only depend on a single data
symbol, but also on symbols adjacent in time. This effect is called intersymbol
interference.In addition to being caused by a limited bandwidth, intersymbol 
interference may also be caused by the use of a band limiting filter at the transmitter
end, which is used to give a desired shape to the frequency spectrum of the transmitted
or recorded analog pulses. In many cases the presence of intersymbol interference will
lead to an increased symbol error rate.A possibility of restricting the increase of the symbol error rate caused by
intersymbol interference is the use of an equalizer either adaptive or not. An adaptive
equalizer may comprise, for
