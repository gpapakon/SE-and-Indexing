<ABSTRACT>
A system of the present invention includes a deep draw 

package (100) enclosing a three dimensional item (200) such as for 
example a blood collection tube or the like, and an apparatus and 

method for making the same. The deep draw package (100) includes an 
upper film (106) and a lower film (104) each having a cavity (102A,102B) 

formed 
therein, with the films sealingly joined together along the 

periphery of the cavities to form an item containing 
compartment therein. A tab member (116) is provided along one edge of 

the films to facilitate opening of the package (100). The apparatus 
and method of the present invention include a number of sub-assemblies 

for providing an upper film (106) and a lower film (104), 
forming cavities (102) in the films, placing the item (200) in one of the 

cavities (102), sealing the films together along the periphery of the 
cavities to form a continuous web (112) and cutting the continuous 

web into strips having the desired number of packages (100) formed 
therein. The sub-assembly for forming the cavities (102) in the 

films (104,106) includes a female die member (46), a male die member 
(48) and a 

polymeric back-up plate (50) to relieve stress during the formation 
of the cavities (102) in the films (104,106).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to packages for 
three-dimensional items, including blood collection tubes, 
syringes, and the like, and more specifically relates to a deep 
draw package for hermetically enclosing or storing such three 
dimensional items. In addition, the present invention relates to 
an apparatus and method for making such packages. Individual packages for three dimensional items are well 
know in the art and are typically made or otherwise formed from 
foil or polymeric materials. However, several problems and 
limitations have been associated with the use of such packages 
including the use thereof for items which because of their size 
and outer dimensions require deep drawing which prior hereto 
required air compressors and pharmaceutical quality filtering 
systems. Also, such packages were prone to stress cracks at the 
corners and other contours which rendered such packages 
unacceptable for hermetically sealing medical items such as blood 
collection tubes. Thus, there has been a need for a deep draw package, as well 
as an apparatus and method for making the same, which would 
eliminate the problems and limitations associated with the prior 
packages discussed above, most significant of the problems being 
associated with deep drawing and hermetically sealing the 
package.  
 EP-A 23264 describes a method of making a filled deep draw package 
using a die assembly to form cavities in upper and lower films and sealing the 
films after placing an object in a cavity. The present invention provides a method of making a deep draw package 
comprising the steps of; 
providing an upper film and a lower film of poly-laminate material; providing a die assembly comprising a female member and male member 
for forming cavities in each film;  clamping said film between said female member and a back-up plate 
including a polymer material so that the elastomer properties of the material 
allows the proper amount of creep and displacement to relieve the stress in the 
films and to prevent stress cracks when said female member and male member 
are brought together to form a cavity in each film;  forming a cavity in each film by bringing said female and male members 
together;  placing an item in said cavity formed in one of said films;  bring said films in contact with one another so that said cavities define a 
compartment for enclosing said item; and sealing said films together to form a continuous web. A deep draw package particularly suited for use with three dimensional 
medical

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a deep draw package (100) comprising the steps of; 

providing an upper film (106) and a lower film (104) of poly-laminate 
material; 
providing a die assembly comprising a female member (46) and male 
member (48) for forming cavities (102) in each film; 
clamping said film between said female member (46) and a back-up plate 
(50) including a polymer material so that the elastomer properties of the 

material allows the proper amount of creep and displacement to relieve the 
stress in the films and to prevent stress cracks when said female member and 

male member are brought together to form a cavity in each film: 
forming a cavity (102) in each film by bringing said female and male 
members together; 
placing an item (200) in said cavity formed in one of said films; 
bringing said films in contact with one another so that said cavities define a 
compartment for enclosing said item; and 
sealing said films together to form a continuous web (112). 
The method of forming the deep draw package defined in Claim 1, further 
comprising the step of cutting said continuous web (112) into strips including 

one or more deep draw packages (100).  
 
The method of forming the deep draw package defined in Claim 1, further 
comprising the step of forming a tab member (116) along at least one edge of 

said films. 
An apparatus (20) for making a deep draw package (100), comprising: 

means (22) for providing an upper (104) and lower (102) film of poly-laminate 
material; 
a cavity forming member for forming a plurality of cavities (102) in each 
film, said cavity forming member being coupled to said means (22) for 

providing an upper and lower film, said cavity forming member including a 
female member (46) and male member (48); 
a holding member for holding each film, said holding member being 
coupled to said cavity forming member, said holding member including a 

back-up plate (50) having at least a layer of polymer material so that when 
said back-up plate and said female member (46) are clamped together with 

one of said films therebetween, the elastomer properties of the polymeric 
material allows the proper amount of creep and displacement to relieve the 

stress in the film and prevent stress cracks; 
means for placing at least one item (200) in one of said cavities (102) in 
either said upper film or said lower film, said means for placing at least one 

item in one of said cavities being coupled to said holding member; and; 
means (30) for sealing said films together with at least one of said cavities 
formed therein to define an individual item containing compartment. 
The apparatus defined in Claim 4, further comprising means (32) for cutting 
said continuous web (112) into individual strips having at least one deep draw
  
 

package therein. 
The apparatus defined in Claim 5, wherein said means for cutting said 
continuous web includes razors.
