<ABSTRACT>
A method determining the plutonium content of a material 
containing fluorine involves obtaining the mass ratio of 

plutonium in a compound comprising plutonium and 
fluorine, particularly plutonium tetrafluoride, to the 

total plutonium content. The method utilises a high 
resolution gamma ray spectrometry technique to obtain a 

count rate in a pair of gamma ray photopeaks. One of the 
photopeaks has an energy level of 414 keV, resulting from 

the decay of plutonium-239, and the other photopeak has 
an energy level of 583 keV, resulting from the decay of 

an excited sodium-22 nucleus following an (alpha,n) 
interaction with fluorine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the determination of the 
plutonium content in plutonium contaminated material 
containing fluorine, particularly fluorine in the form of 
plutonium tetrafluoride. Fluorine is used in the process for manufacturing 
plutonium metal so that many waste items made from this 
material may contain fluorine or fluorides. When 
disposing of these waste items they are deposited in 
large drums. It is important that the plutonium content 
of these drums is accurately measured so that the drums 
can be filled to a maximum amount without exceeding the 
fissile limit. If the capacity of the drums is 
efficiently utilised a reduction in overall disposal 
costs can be achieved. It has been found when using a total neutron 
counting technique for such measurements that the 
quantity of plutonium present can be overestimated due to 
the emission of interfering (alpha, n) reaction neutrons. 
The (alpha, n) neutron emission is particularly severe 
when the plutonium is in the form of plutonium 
tetrafluoride. The assessment of plutonium content using total 
neutron counting requires an accurate knowledge of the 
specific neutron emission rate. For plutonium contained 
in waste material the specific neutron rate is dependent 
on the isotopic composition, the chemical composition and 
the matrix composition. The isotopic composition defines 
the spontaneous fission neutron rate and also the alpha 
emission rate which then influences the (alpha, n) 
reaction rates due to the chemical and matrix 
compositions. The chemical composition affects the (alpha, n) 
neutron rate. For example, alpha interactions with 
fluorine produce many more neutrons than alpha reactions 
with oxygen. The presence of light elements, for example  
 
oxygen and fluorine, in the matrix also affects the 
(alpha, n) neutron rate, although to a lesser extent than 
their presence in the chemical composition. The use of a conventional neutron coincidence 
counting technique for plutonium assaying is not 
considered suitable where large quantities of plutonium 
tetrafluoride are present. This is because the 
coincidence circuitry of the measuring equipment is 
unable to cope with very high random pulse rates and 
measurement precision tends to be very poor. It is an object of this invention to provide a 
method of determining the plutonium content of plutonium 
contaminated material which overcomes the problem of 
overestimation caused by the presence of fluorine. According to the present invention there is provided 
a method of
