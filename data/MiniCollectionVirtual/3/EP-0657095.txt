A combine harvester having a chaff cutter (2) which is connected
downstream of a threshing and separating device and which is

displaceable on the straw hood (3) by way of a motion member (4) into an
operative position (A) and into an inoperative position (B), and wherein

the chaff cutter (2) and a discharge member (7) are in the form of a
structural unit and said structural unit is mounted slidably on guides

(5, 6) of the straw hood and is movable into its two positions (A, B) by
means of the motion member (4), preferably a pressure fluid cylinder,

characterised in that the structural unit comprising the chaff cutter
(2) and the discharge member (7) additionally has a chaff guide rake (8)

and the discharge member (7) of the chaff cutter (2) and/or the chaff
guide rake (8) which is arranged on the chaff cutter (2) are pivotable

in dependence on the sliding movement of the chaff cutter (2) by way of
coupling members (9 to 13) into the operative position (A) and into the

inoperative position (B).
A combine harvester according to claim 1 characterised in that
the control and pivoting member (9) in the form of a multi-arm lever is

mounted pivotably about the axis (19) provided stationarily on the
shaped rail member (6) of the chaff cutter housing (18), on one side of

the axis (19) it has a fork portion (20) for pivotal connection of the
piston rod (4b) of the pressure fluid cylinder (4) in a horizontal axis

(21), on the other side of the axis (19) it has a pivotal movement-limiting
and entrainment fork (23) co-operating with an abutment (22) on

the chaff cutter housing (18) in two pivotal positions, and it has a
lever-shaped extension (24) which extends in the longitudinal direction

of the pressure fluid cylinder (4).
A combine harvester according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that a first lever (10) is pivotably conn
ected by one
end at a horizontal pivot axis (25) to the lever-shaped extension (24)

of the control and pivoting member (9), the lever (10) being pivotably
connected by its other end by way of a horizontal axis (26) to a 

junction plate (13) mounted pivotably about a stationary horizontal axis
(27) on the chaff cutter housing (18),


a second lever (11) is pivotably connected by one end to the
junction plate (13) at a horizontal axis (28), said second lever at its

other end adjustably engaging the discharge member (7) of the chaff
cutter (2), and
a third lever (12) is pivotably mounted by one end to the junction
plate (13) at a horizontal axis (29), said third lever in its other end

having a shaft (30) which is mounted rotatably in the chaff cutter
housing (18) and to which the chaff guide rake (8) is motionally rigidly

secured.
A combine harvester according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the pivotable chaff guide plate (15) is secured to

the pivotable junction plate (13) and is pivotable therewith about the
horizontal axis (27).
A combine harvester according to one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the discharge member (7) is mounted pivotably

about the rotor axis of rotation (31) and its lever (11) moving it is
pivotably connected to a control lever (32) which is adjustably fixed to

a member (33) having an array of holes and secured to the discharge
member (7), for adjusting the magnitude of the angle of pivotal movement

of the discharge member (7).
A combine harvester according to one of claims 1 to 5
characterised in that the stationary axis (27) of the junction plate

(13) lies with the axes (26, 28, 29) of the three levers (10, 11, 12) at
the corner points of a quadrilateral, preferably a trapezium.
A combine harvester according to one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that the chaff guide rake (8) has a tube (37) with

prongs (38), the tube (37) is mounted rotatably through a limited angle
about a bar (39) fixed to the shaft (30) and the tube (37) with prongs 

(38) can be pivoted in towards the centre of the combine harvester about
the bar (39) by a control portion (40) secured to the chaff cutter

housing (18) and an abutment (41) mounted to the tube (37) upon upward
pivotal movement of the chaff guide rake (8).
A combine harvester according to one of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that a respective chaff guide rake (8) is arranged in

each of the two sides of the chaff cutter (2) and the two chaff guide
rakes (8) are secured to a common continuous shaft (30) and can be

pivoted in towards each other by a respective abutment (41) co-operating
with a control portion (40).
A combine harvester according to one of claims 1 to 8
characterised in that the coupling members formed by the junction plate

(13), the three levers (10, 11, 12) and the control and pivoting member
(9) are arranged at least at one side of the chaff cutter (2) and are

actuable by the pressure fluid cylinder (4).
