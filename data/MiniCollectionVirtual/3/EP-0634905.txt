<ABSTRACT>
The improved carpet cleaning machine (10), intended for use with "dry" carpet cleaning systems using dampened particles (17), can be used for carpet "brushing" for dirt removal and for later vacuuming to remove dirt-laden particles (17). The machine (10) has a concentrically-mounted cyclone separator (21a) and a conical screen filter (23a) in series. The separator (21a) has air (25) flowing through it downwardly along a vortical path (37) and then upward along another path (45). Such upward-flowing air impinges on the outer surface (47) of the screen filter (23a) and many particles (17) adhering to such filter (23a) are dislodged. One or more additional media (67, 87) may be used to remove very fine particles (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a machine for removing dirt-laden particles from a
carpet according to the preamble of claim 1.The three primary approaches used to clean commercial and residential carpets
are steam or hot water, foam and dry systems. Dry-type carpet cleaning
systems are further divided into two broad categories. One uses a dry or
substantially dry powder and the other uses granules, each of which is several
times larger than a powder grain. The granules are slightly moistened with
cleaning solvents for dirt removal. The inventive machine has utility for both
categories of dry systems but relates primarily to those using granules rather
than powder. Such machine also has utility in situations where only carpet 
vacuuming is performed. That is, its long-bristled brushes are higly effective in
removing loose sand and other soil not requiring the application of solvent-bearing
material.A machine according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in DE-A 708 415.
This document shows a machine for removing dirt-laden particles with a
tapered cyclone filter and a flat mesh filter at the top edge of the cyclone filter.
The air inlet tube is positioned at the middle of such cyclone filter. At the top of
the machine a fine filter is positioned through which the filtered air flows
outside. In this document nothing is said about machine-mounted brushes
dislodging particles from a carpet.Another carpet cleaning machine is disclosed in US-A 5,077,853. This carpet
cleaning machine shows two counter-rotating brushes for dislodging particles
from a carpet. Of the dry granular carpet cleaning systems, the best
known and most widely used is the HOST速 dry extraction
system offered by Racine Industries, Inc. of Racine,
Wisconsin. The HOST速 system applies granules to carpet
fibers using a machine as shown in Rench et al. U.S. Patent
Nos. 2,842,788 and 2,961,673. Such machine, sold under the
HOST速 trademark, is devoid of vacuum capability and has a
pair of spaced brushes counter-rotating at relatively low
speed (about 350 rpm) to stroke the cleaning granules into,
through and across the carpet and its fibers.The granules are referred to as "dry" and are
substantially so even though moistened with cleaning
solvents. When stroked as described, these granules
"scrub" dirt and soil from such fibers including oily and
non-oily soil. The carpet is cleaned by working the HOST速
machine across it in different directions. During the
cleaning process, granules migrate to the carpet backing
adjacent the base of the fiber. A few

<CLAIMS>
A machine (10) for removing dirt-laden particles (17) from a
carpet (11) and including (a) means for dislodging the particles

(17) from the carpet (11), (b) a machine mounted vacuum system
drawing the dislodged particles (17) into a moving stream of

air (25) flowing through an air-guiding channel (35), and (c)
first, second and third particle-removing media (21,23) in the

stream of air (25), the first medium (21) comprising a cone-shaped
separator (21a) and the third particle-removing medium

being disposed (67) in the stream of air (25) downstream of the
second medium (23), the machine (10) being characterized in

that:

the means for dislodging the particles from the carpet comprise
a pair of machine-mounted brushes (13,15),
the second medium (23) is a cone-shaped mesh filter (23a)
extending downwardly into the cone-shaped separator (21a),
wherein the air-entrained particles moving in the first
medium (21) impinge on the second medium (23) hereby

dislodging a portion of the particles adhered to the
second medium (23) thus purging the second medium (23).
The machine of claim 1 further

characterized in that:

the first medium (21) has a top edge (53);
the second medium (23) has a top edge (55); and
the top edges (53,55) of the first and second media (21,23) are
generally coplanar.
The machine (10) of claim 2 further

characterized in that

the third medium (67) is a generally flat filter mat (67c).
The machine (10) of claim 3 further

characterized in that

the filter mat (67c) is in a slide-out tray (71).
The machine (10) of claim 3 further

characterized in that

the filter mat (67c) is like a rippon and is fed from a dispenser (73).
The machine (10) of claim 2 further

characterized in that

the third filter medium (67) is an open cell foan filter (67a).
The machine (10) of claim 2 further

characterized in that

the third filter medium (67) is an automotive-type filter
(67b).
