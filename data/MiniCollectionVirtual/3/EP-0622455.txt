<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for detecting microorganisms in a 
plurality of sealable containers adapted to sustain 

microorganism growth includes a single light source (36) such as a 
laser with a two-dimensional laser deflector (48) directing an output 

beam component from the laser serially towards each of the 
containers (22). A sensor (28) is spread along an inner surface of the 

containers. The selective emission of a sensor is monitored to 
determine whether biological activity is present in a 

container. A disclosed embodiment includes the use of a 
high-frequency modulator and decay time sensors. Biological 

activity is determined by monitoring the decay time of the 
sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-invasive 
method and to an apparatus for detecting biological activities 
in a bodily fluid specimen sample, such as blood or sputum. 
Specimen samples and a culture medium are introduced into 
sealable containers, such as vials, and are then exposed to 
conditions enabling a variety of metabolic, physical, and 
chemical changes to take place in the presence of microorganisms 
within the sample. The presence of a biologically active agent, such as 
bacteria in a patient's body fluids, especially blood, is 
generally determined using culture vials. A small quantity of 
the bodily fluid is injected through an enclosing rubber septum 
into a sterile vial containing a culture medium. The vial is 
incubated at 37°C and monitored for microorganism growth. A technique used to detect the presence of 
microorganisms involves visual inspection. Generally, visual 
inspection involves monitoring the turbidity or eventual color 
changes of the liquid suspension of a bodily fluid and culture 
medium. Known sensors respond to changes in pH, oxygen 
concentration, or carbon dioxide concentration by changing their 
reflectivity, opacity, color or by changing their fluorescence 
intensity. The outputs from these sensors are generally based 
upon light intensity measurements. Light sources used to excite 
the sensors or the photodetectors used to monitor intensities 
exhibit aging effects over time. This means that errors may 
occur. Additionally, vial positioning is extremely important 
when intensity measurements are required. Even minor vial 
mis-positioning may affect detection measurements. Further, it  
 
is not always possible to make incubators completely light 
tight. Random light entering an incubator may cause dark 
currents, also affecting detection measurements. Disadvantages of intensity-based methods may be 
overcome by using modulated excitation light in combination with 
sensors that change their fluorescence decay time in response to 
changing pH, oxygen concentration, carbon dioxide concentration, 
or in response to other biological activities. Using this 
approach, intensity measurements are replaced with time 
measurements, so intensity changes do not influence the 
results. However, fluorescence decay time sensors require 
high-brightness short-wavelength light sources (550 nm or 
shorter) that are intensity-modulated at very high frequencies 
(typically above 100 MHz). Because such a light 
source/modulator combination is expensive, vials would have to 
be
