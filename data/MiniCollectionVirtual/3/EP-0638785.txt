<ABSTRACT>
Device for the flow measurement of a liquid which is flowing through a measuring tube which is arranged essentially horizontally and which liquid contains freely displaceable electrical charges. The device has a magnet arrangement for generating at least two magnetic field states, which penetrate the measuring tube and extend essentially mirror-symmetrically to a vertical plane containing the axis of the measuring tube, of which states the first penetrates a horizontal plane intersecting the measuring tube and having a course in the same direction essentially on both sides of the horizontal plane, and of which states the second, having an essentially opposing course on both sides of the horizontal plane, is zero in at least one point lying on the vertical plane and the horizontal plane. The device has a single pair of electrodes, fitted to the measuring tube on both sides of the vertical plane, for detecting charge displacements in the liquid, and has a circuit arrangement which corrects the voltage which is produced between the electrodes in the first magnetic field state and is predominantly only approximately proportional to the flow of the liquid, by means of the voltage produced between the electrodes in the second magnetic field state, to form an output signal essentially proportional to the flow of the liquid. The device is characterised in that the electrodes are located in a second horizontal plane which is offset from the first-named horizontal plane in such a manner that a unique relationship is produced between the voltages, on the one hand, and the flow of the liquid, on the other hand, the said relationship being a function of the flow of the liquid but not of the flow profile of the liquid.

Device for measuring the flow of a liquid containing freely
movable electrical charges and flowing through a substantially

horizontally arranged measuring tube (2), with a magnet
arrangement (4, 6) for producing at least two magnetic field

states (Fig. 4 and 5) penetrating through the measuring tube and
extending substantially symmetrically to a vertical plane (V)

containing the axis (8) of the measuring tube (2), of which the
first (Fig. 4) penetrates a first horizontal plane (H1) cutting

the measuring tube (2) with a course in substantially the same
direction on either side of the first horizontal plane (H1) and

of which the second (Fig. 5) with a course substantially in
opposite directions on either side of the first horizontal plane

(H1) is zero (Fig. 5) in at least one point located on the
vertical plane (V) and the first horizontal plane (H1), with a

single pair of electrodes (10, 12) arranged on the measuring
tube (2) on either side of the vertical plane (V) for detecting

charge transfers in the liquid, and with a circuit arrangement
which is designed to detect the voltage Ur, generally only

approximately proportional to the flow of the liquid, between
the electrodes (10, 12) in the first magnetic field state (Fig.

4) and the voltage Ug between the electrodes (10, 12) in the
second magnetic field state (Fig. 5) and to correct the voltage

Ur to an output signal substantially proportional to the flow of
the liquid on the basis of the two voltages Ur, Ug,

characterised in that the electrodes (10, 12) are located in a
second horizontal plane (H2) which is offset from the first

horizontal plane (H1) in such a way that there is a clear
connection, dependent on the flow of the liquid but not on the 

flow profile of the liquid, between the voltages Ug and Ur on
the one hand and the flow of the liquid on the other hand, and

in that the circuit arrangement is designed to determine a
correction factor a for correcting the voltage Ur, on the basis

of a respective value of the quotient Ug/Ur of the two voltages
Ug and Ur.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
circuit arrangement comprises a clock generator (18) which is

designed to control the magnet arrangement (4, 6) and a switch
(16), to the input of which the electrodes (10, 12) are

connected via an amplifier (14), wherein the switch (16)
controlled by the clock generator (18) is designed to supply the

voltage Ur in the first magnetic field state by means of a first
channel (24) and the voltage Ug in the second magnetic field

state by means of a second channel (26) to a quotient former
(30) for forming the voltage quotient Ug/Ur, and in that the

circuit arrangement also has a correction circuit (32)
electrically connected to the quotient former (30) for

determining the correction value a on the basis of the quotient
Ug/Ur, and a multiplier (28) for multiplication of the

correction value a by the voltage Ur.
