<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for producing a styrenic 
polymer having a syndiotactic configuration which comprises 

polymerizing a styrenic monomer containing hydrogen dissolved 
therein at a hydrogen partial pressure of at most 1 kg/cmÂ²G 

by the use of a polymerization catalyst comprising an (a) 
transition metal compound and a (b) coordination complex 

compound composed of a cation and an anion in which a 
plurality of radicals are bonded to a metal, or an 

aluminoxane and, when necessary, a (c) alkylating agent. The 
above process is capable of modifying the molecular weight of 

the objective SPS, lowering its molecular weight without 
expanding the molecular weight distribution, and decreasing 

the required quantity of the catalyst and the residual 
quantities of metals in the resultant SPS, whereby the 

production cost of the objective SPS is considerably 
curtailed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing
a styrenic polymer having a syndiotactic configuration. More
particularly, it pertains to a process for producing such a
styrenic polymer which is capable of modifying the molecular
weight of the polymer without altering its molecular weight
distribution and at the same time, of curtailing the
production cost of the polymer.In recent years, there has been proposed a process for
producing a styrenic polymer having a syndiotactic
configuration (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "SPS") by
polymerizing a styrenic monomer by means of a catalyst
comprising a transition metal compound as a primary
ingredient, especially a titanium compound and an
alkylaluminoxane (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No. 187708/1987).There has also been proposed a process for efficiently
producing such a styrenic polymer (SPS) by the use of a
catalyst comprising a coordination complex compound composed
of an anion in which a plurality of radicals are bonded to a
metal and a cation, while dispensing with an aluminoxane
which is expensive and is to be used in a large amount (refer
to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 415573/1990,
415574/1990, etc.). In addition, there has been proposed a process for
polymerizing a styrenic monomer by the use of the above-mentioned
catalyst comprising a transition metal compound and
an alkylaluminoxane, characterized in that hydrogen is made
to exist as a molecular weight modifier in the polymerizing
system for the purpose of modifying the molecular weight of
the styrenic polymer to be produced (refer to Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 179906/1988).However, in the case of employing a catalyst comprising
a coordination complex compound composed of an anion in which
a plurality of radicals are bonded to a metal and a cation in
place of an aluminoxane to compensate for the expensiveness
of an aluminoxane and a low yield of SPS due to the use
thereof, the polymerization temperature is made higher or a
large amount of an alkylaluminum as a molecular weight
modifier is added to the polymerization system.
Nevertheless, the aforesaid method suffers the disadvantages
that the yield of the SPS to be produced is still low and the
amounts of residual metals are unfavorably increased.As a result of intensive research and investigation made
by the present inventors under such circumstances, it has
been found that in the case of polymerizing a styrenic
monomer by the use of a transition metal compound and a
coordination
