<ABSTRACT>
A method of dynamically allocating bandwidth of 
channels to cells in a communications cellular 

network according to user demand. Disjoint groups 
of cells are formed so as to minimize interference 

within each group, and a particular channel is 
assigned to each of the groups. The bandwidth of 

each channel then dynamically allocated by time 
division to each of the cells in a group according 

to user demand in each of the cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for dynamically
allocating bandwidth to cells in a cellular network.Consider a wireless mobile local area network environment
supporting many low power, portable, personal computers or
communication devices. The portable personal computers are
assumed to support a host of communication services with
high data rate applications ranging from interactive data
with voice capability to multimedia. The geographical area
is divided into small cells for two major reasons. Firstly,
the power limitations of mobile terminals dictate the
maximum range of wireless communication. Secondly, smaller
cells allow greater spatial reuse of the communication
bandwidth than larger cells. Associated with each cell
there is one base station and time-varying population of
mobile stations. This structure, see FIG. 1, lends itself
to a cellular architecture in which mobile and base
stations communicate over a wireless channel. The base
stations communicate amongst themselves via by some stationary
high-speed backbone networks. As an example, consider
the environment of an industrial campus consisting of
several office buildings. The buildings are divided into
cells and cells are connected via some backbone network
such as a wired LAN. Portable terminals can operate both
indoor and outdoor with limited range (e.g, 50 meters) and
have wireless access to the base stations on the backbone
network. Each wireless channel in the network is shared by
many mobile stations. In addition, in areas where cells of
different base stations overlap, the wireless channel is
shared by two or more base stations. Thus, in order to 
enable reliable and efficient communications between the
mobile stations and the fixed backbone network, a multiaccess
protocol must be employed.In general, any multiaccess scheme for cellular networks can
be divided into the intercell tier and intracell tier. The
intercell tier ensures that transmissions of users from
different cells within each subnetwork (e.g, LAN, WAN) do not
interfere with each other. This tier of the multiaccess
scheme is essentially a coordination among the base stations.
The intracell tier ensures that within each cell of the
network, the transmissions of all users that are within the
same cell do not interfere with each other. This tier of the
multiaccess scheme is essentially a coordination among mobile
users that are within the same cell.A problem in such environments is as follows. A basic
constraint in every wireless communication system is that

<CLAIMS>
A method of allocating communications bandwidth to cells
in a cellular network comprising the steps of:


a. partitioning communications bandwidth into a
plurality of distinct channels;
b. forming a plurality of disjoint groups (201, 202) of said
cells, said plurality of groups being equal in

number to said plurality of distinct channels, by
collecting into each said group a plurality of said

cells selected so as to minimize interference
between cells within each said group, at least one

said group having some interference between cells
therein, no two of said groups having the same one of

said cells therein; and assigning a distinct channel
to each of said groups; characterized by
c. allocating bandwidth of each of said channels to
cells in each group to which each channel is

assigned, said bandwidth of each of said channels
being dynamically allocated according to user

demand in each cell of a group having said each
channel assigned thereto.
A method as recited in claim 1 wherein step (b) of claim
1 is performed by:

assigning one of said distinct channels to each said cell
one cell at a time, each successive cell being assigned

the channel that is least assigned to neighbors of said
each successive cell that already have been assigned a

channel forming one of said plurality of groups.
A method as recited in claim 1, wherein a superframe
having a plurality of time slots is defined for said

distinct channel assigned to each of said groups, and 
said bandwidth of said distinct channel is allocated in

a second tier of allocation to each cell of said at
least one group by dynamically allocating a number of

said time slots to said each cell in accordance with user
demand in said each cell.
An apparatus for allocating communications bandwidth to
cells in a cellular network, comprising:


a. means for forming disjoint groups of said cells to
minimize interference within each of said groups;
b. means for assigning a distinct channel of said
bandwidth to each of said groups; characterized by
c. means for allocating bandwidth of each of said
channels to cells in each group to which each

channel is assigned, said bandwidth of each of said
channels being dynamically assigned according to

user demand in each cell of a group having said each
channel assigned thereto.
