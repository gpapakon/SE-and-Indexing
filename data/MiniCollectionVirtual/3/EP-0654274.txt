<ABSTRACT>
The process comprises an initial step involving suction of 
air from the autoclave, an intermediate step of introducing 

water into the autoclave and heating said water until a 
reference pressure (P
r
), corresponding to the saturated-steam 
pressure at the sterilization temperature, is achieved 

therein, a sterilization step and a final step in which the 
autoclave is brought back to room pressure (P
a
), heating 
being prolonged until a maximum pressure (P
m
) higher than 
said reference pressure (P
r
) is obtained in the autoclave and 
during said sterilization step at least one bleeding 

operation being carried out for ejecting air mixed with steam 
from the autoclave in a manner adapted to bring pressure from 

said maximum pressure (P
m
) to said reference pressure (P
r
). 
The plant comprises a boiler shell (3) forming a chamber (4) 

adapted to hold the objects to be sterilized, means (5) for 
controlling temperature and pressure in said chamber (4), 

water admitting members (16), pumping members (20) connected 
to said chamber (4) for carrying out suction, and bleeding 

members (21) adapted to operate a controlled relief when said 
chamber (4) is under conditions of at least partial 

pressurization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sterilization process and plant
for a steam autoclave, to be used in particular in the dental
surgery field, as defined in the preamble of the appended
Claims 1 and 7.It is known that steam autoclaves comprise a sterilization
chamber for the objects to be sterilized or disinfected, into
which distilled water is introduced, which water will be
partially converted to steam at high temperatures and
pressures, depending on the provisions of the sterilization
or disinfection programmes.In the currently used sterilization programmes, for example
temperatures of about 134°C and pressures of about 205 KPa
are provided over a period of time of variable duration
depending on the nature and porosity of the charge. As far as
disinfection is concerned, temperatures close to 105°C are
sufficient. Tolerances of one or two centigrade degrees are
provided on the above temperature values.In autoclaves of this kind the sterilizing function is
performed by saturated steam carrying out a heat exchange
with the material in the sterilization chamber. The air
present in the sterilization chamber must be drawn out in
order to avoid the formation of air pockets or layers
preventing an efficient steam penetration and an appropriate
heat exchange between the saturated steam and the material to
be sterilized.In addition air, by its expansion, alters the correct
temperature-pressure ratio existing under saturated-steam
conditions, thereby giving rise to greater pressures.Practically, while in the presence of saturated steam alone,
pressures and temperatures are closely correlated with each
other and reflect well-known theoretical values, in the
presence of saturated steam mixed with air said theoretical
values are altered and the more the amount of air present is
high, the more the pressure is higher than the theoretical
saturated-steam pressure at a given temperature.For the above reasons, in the autoclaves an important air 
ejection from the boiler chamber is provided prior to the
sterilization step.This is done for example by employing repeated discharges
or bleedings of air mixed with steam to gradually reduce
the air concentration in the boiler chamber during a pre-conditioning
stage, before saturated steam conditions are
achieved, as disclosed in EP-A-0 492 056. Air evacuation is
made by venting the chamber until a saturated steam
condition is sensed.Another solution for carrying out an almost complete air
ejection consists in sucking air from the boiler chamber
filled with the material, by means of

A sterilization process for a steam autoclave,
comprising:


a pre-sterilization step including admission of a water dose
to said autoclave and heating of said water, which heating

leads to the achievement of a reference pressure (P
r
)
corresponding to the saturated-steam pressure at the desired

sterilization temperature,
a sterilization step carried out after said pre-sterilization
step and prolonged in time, and
a final step in which, once sterilization has occurred,
said autoclave is brought back to room pressure (P
a
), 
the process being characterized in that a suction step is carried out
prior to said pre-sterilization step for producing an initial vacuum in

said autoclave to evacuate a first amount of air from said
autoclave,

in that said heating is
prolonged until a maximum pressure (P
m
) higher than said
reference pressure (P
r
) is achieved,
and in that during said sterilization step at least one
bleeding is carried out which is adapted to eject from said

autoclave a residual amount of air mixed with steam so as to bring
