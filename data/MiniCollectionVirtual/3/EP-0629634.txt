A process for the preparation of a taurocholanic acid derivative
of formula (I):



in which A completes the 5β-cyclopentaneperhydrophenanthrene
structure of a cholanic acid and E is hydrogen or a methyl group, or one of

its salts, characterised in that

(a) a cholanic acid of formula (II):


in which A and E are as defined above, is treated with an acid chloride of
formula (III):



in which R is a hydrocarbon residue bonded to the carbonyl group by a
tertiary carbon, in the presence of a tertiary amine, optionally in a polar

aprotic organic solvent which is miscible or partially miscible with water;
and then
(b) the thus obtained intermediate mixed anhydride of formula
(IV): 



in which A, E and R are as defined above, is treated with at least an
equimolar amount of taurine relative to the cholanic acid of formula (II)

and the obtained product of formula (I) is isolated as such or in the form of
one of its salts.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that A
completes the structure of ursodeoxycholic acid.
A process according to claim 1, chatacterised in that A
completes the structure of chenodeoxycholic acid.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that R is a hydrocarbon residue bonded to the carbonyl by a tertiary

carbon and containing from 3 to 24 carbon atoms.
A process according to claim 4, characterised in that the
compound of formula (III) is selected from pivaloyl chloride, benzoyl

chloride, 2,2-dimethylvaleroyl chloride, 2-naphthoyl chloride, 1-naphthoyl
chloride, 1-methylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid chloride and cyclohex-1-enecarboxylic

acid chloride.
A process according to claim 5, characterised in that the
compound of formula (III) is selected from pivaloyl chloride and benzoyl

chloride.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the tertiary amine is selected from triethylamine, tributylamine, N-methylpiperidine,

pyridine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that the compound of formula (III) is used in an equimolar amount or in

slight excess relative to the cholanic acid of formula (II).
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that the reaction is carried out in a polar or apolar, aprotic organic

solvent which is miscible or partially miscible with water. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised
in that the taurine is added to the reaction mixture in a basic aqueous

solution.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised
in that the taurine is used in an excess relative to the cholanic acid of

formula (II).
Anhydrides of formula (IV):


in which A completes the 5β-cyclopentaneperhydrophenanthrene
structure of a cholanic acid, E is hydrogen or a methyl and R is a

hydrocarbon residue bonded to the carbonyl group by a tertiary carbon.
An anhydride according to claim 12, characterised in that R is a
hydrocarbon residue bonded to the carbonyl by a tertiary carbon and

containing from 3 to 24 carbon atoms.
An anhydride according to claim 12, characterised in that A
completes the structure of ursodeoxycholic acid and R is a tert-butyl or

phenyl group.
An anhydride according to claim 12, characterised in that A
completes the structure of chenodeoxycholic acid and R is a tert-butyl or

phenyl group.
The benzoic anhydride of 3α,7β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic
acid.
