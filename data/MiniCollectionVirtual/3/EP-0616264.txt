<ABSTRACT>
An image is fixed to a sheet of paper, in an image 
reproducing machine, in a fixing station (GF). This uses heat 

and pressure to fix the image. A pair of straightening rolls 
(58,57) downstream of the fixing station apply tension to the 

sheets in the direction of advance and forward them in a 
direction which inclines by a predetermined angle of correction 

with respect to the natural direction (21) with which the sheets 
leave the fixing station. The straightening rolls form a nip 

(62) therebetween and this may extend around a portion of the 
periphery of one of the rolls such that sheets passing 

therethrough are bent in an opposite direction to their natural 
direction of curl. 
There is a second nip (c) created by a third roller (66) in order to 

force the sheets to follow the surface of the first roller (58) for a 
determined angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
eliminating sheet curl and more particularly for eliminating 
sheet curl from sheets emerging from a hot fixing station in a 
copying machine or any similar image processing machine. It is well known, that in an electrophotographic 
copier the images to be reproduced are developed by means of 
particles of the toner and are then transferred to a sheet of 
paper. In order to fix the particles of toner to the paper, 
the sheets are passed through a fixing station, which works by 
heat and pressure, in which the particles of toner are softened 
and caused to penetrate into the paper, thereby fixing them 
stably to the paper. As a result of the effect of the heat and pressure, 
tensions are created within the thickness of the paper and the 
sheets of paper tend to curl. Subsequently, when deposited in a 
delivery tray, the sheets may retain this curl and in some cases 
a sheet may roll up on itself. A device which attempts to overcome this problem is 
known from the US Patent No. 4475896 in which a sheet emerging 
from the fixing assembly passes between a pair of curling 
rollers, one of which is a compliant roller having a soft, 
pliable material therearound and the other roller forming a nip 
with the compliant roller. Next, the sheet is advanced between 
two parallel spaced apart guides which are arranged to pivot at 
one edge closely adjacent the rollers. The guides are rotated 
upwardly or downwardly relative to a horizontal position to 
either increase or decrease the decurling action. Another decurler having cooperating roller sections, is known from GB-A-2 063 225. A device for eliminating sheet curl is placed 
downstream of a fixing station in a photocopier, laser printer 
or the like. The device is formed from a pair of rolls which 
receive the sheets therebetween and apply tension to them in the 
direction of advance. The rolls forward the sheets in a 
direction out of line with the direction with which they leave 
the fixing station. Using such an arrangement sheet curl is 
eliminated and sheets are made perfectly flat.  
 A pair of straightening rolls may be provided which 
define a nip which extends around one of the rolls. Sheets pass 
through this nip and are bent in an opposite direction to the 
natural direction of curl which they have on leaving the fixing 
station. The invention is defined in its various aspects in the 
appended claims to which reference should now be made. Embodiments of the invention will now be described in 
detail by way

<CLAIMS>
A device for eliminating the curl of sheets emerging 
from a fixing station (CF) for fixing images on said sheets by 

pressure and heat in an image reproduction machine, the fixing 
station comprising a flat heated fixing member (35) and an 

opposite pressure roller (42), said device comprising a pair of 
rotatable straightening rollers (57,58) disposed downstream of 

the fixing station and forming a first nip (62) therebetween, to 
apply a tension to the sheets, characterised in that said first 

nip extends by an angle (ϑ
1
) between 5° and 30° measured on the 
periphery of a first one (58) of said straightening rollers, and 

in that said device further comprises a pair of drawing rollers 
(63,64) arranged downstream
 of the straightening rollers in such 
a way as to hold the sheets adhering to the periphery of said 

first one (58) of said straightening rollers along both the 
first nip (62) and a second area of contact extending by a 

second angle (ϑ
2
) of 10° to 45° adjacent the first nip (62). 
whereby the sheet is held to adhere to the periphery of said 

first one (58) of said straightening rollers along both the 
first nip (62) and the arc (ϑ
2
). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said first angle (ϑ
1
) is of 15°. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said second angle (ϑ
2
) is of 30°. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said straightening rollers (57,58) are rotated with a peripheral 

speed approximately 5% greater than the speed at which the 
sheets emerge from the fixing station. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised by further comprising an extra roll (66) urged 

against the first one of said straightening rollers (58) at a 
second nip point (C) shifted with respect to the first nip (62) 

by said second angle (ϑ
2
) of 10° to 45°, whereby the sheet is 
held to adhere the periphery of said first one (58) of said 

straightening rollers along both the first nip (62) and the 
second angle (ϑ
2
).
