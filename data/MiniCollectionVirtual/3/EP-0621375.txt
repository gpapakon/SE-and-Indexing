<ABSTRACT>
An energy absorbing device (10, 80, 100) for 
use alongside a roadway to decelerate an impacting 

vehicle includes first and second elements. The first 
element (18, 82, 108) extends in an axial direction and 

includes a multitude of projecting elements (28, 86, 
110). The second element (26, 88, 102) is movable 

relative to the first element (18, 82, 108) in the 
axial direction, and the first and second elements (18, 

82, 108; 26, 88, 102) are sized to create an 
interference fit such that relative axial movement of 

the second element (28, 86, 110) applies a shear load 
to the first element (18, 82, 108) to progressively 

deform successive ones of the projecting elements (28, 
86, 110) . This progressive deformation of the 

projecting elements (28, 86, 110) retards relative 
axial movement between the first and second elements 

(18, 82, 108; 26, 88, 102).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an energy absorbing 
device suitable for use alongside a roadway to 
decelerate an impacting vehicle. Roadside energy absorbing devices have in the 
past used many approaches to create a retarding force 
tending to slow an impacting vehicle. Inertial 
barriers rely on the dispersion of a mass of material 
such as sand, as described for example in U.S. Patents 
Re. 29,544 and 4,934,661. Other prior art systems have 
used containers of a liquid such as water which is 
forced through one or more orifices in an impact to 
create a retarding force (U.S. Patent 3,672,657) . 
Another approach is described in U.S. Patent 4,352,484, 
in which a foam filled grid is forced through an 
adjacent foam filled grid in an impact. Other prior 
art devices have relied on the deformation of metallic 
elements by bending (U.S. Patents 4,711,481 and 
3,211,260) and on frictional forces generated between 
brake elements and a cable (U.S. Patent 5,022,782). In the last named of these systems, a cable 
is oriented along the axial direction, and an impacting 
vehicle forces a brake assembly to move along the 
cable. This brake assembly includes disc springs that 
press aluminum brake shoes against the cable to create 
a retarding force. This force is largely generated as  
 
a result of friction, though the aluminum is abraded 
during the process as well. EP 0586071, upon which the preamble of claim 1 is 
based, describes a crash barrier which includes a 
scissors linkage which moves from an extended to a 
collapsed position upon impact. Collapse of the 
linkage is resisted by energy absorbing elements. According to the present invention, an energy 
absorbing device includes first and second elements. 
The first element extends in an axial direction and 
comprises a multitude of projecting elements 
distributed on a portion of the first element 
extending axially between first and second positions. 
The second element is mounted to move relative to the 
first element in the axial direction, and the first 
and second elements are sized to create an 
interference fit therebetween such that relative axial 
movement of the second element between the first and 
second positions applies a shear load to the first 
element to progressively deform successive ones of the 
projecting elements. This progressive deformation of 
the projecting elements retards relative axial 
movement of the first and second elements to 
decelerate the impacting vehicle. The following is a description of some specific 
embodiments of

portion (52) towards the reaction portion (54), the linkage 

(56) causes first and second portions of the linkage to move 
away from one another; characterised by: 
the first and second elements (18, 82, 108; 26, 88, 102),
