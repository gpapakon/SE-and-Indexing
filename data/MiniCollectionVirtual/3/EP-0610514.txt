<ABSTRACT>
A charge injection assistant a trace of which is added to a functional layer such as a light-emitting layer of an electroluminescence 
device to improve the charge injection property of the device, and an organic electroluminescence device which contains 

this charge injection assistant, whose applied voltage is low, which operates with a high light-emission efficiency, and has a long 
service life. The assistant is used for organic electronic devices in which positive holes are injected into an organic functional layer 

for transferring positive holes from outside this functional layer, and is made of a stilbene derivative, a distyrylarylene derivative 
or a tristyrylarylene derivative. In the organic electroluminescence device containing the charge injection assistant described 

above, the ionization energy of this charge injection assistant is lower than that of the light emitting layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel charge injection
auxiliary material and an organic electroluminescence device
containing the same. More particularly, it pertains to a
charge injection auxiliary material capable of enhancing charge
injecting properties which is a derivative of stilbene,
distyrylarylene or tris(styrylarylene) and an organic
electroluminescence device having a lowered applied voltage, an
enhanced light emission efficiency and a prolonged service life
which contains the above-mentioned charge injection auxiliary
material.In recent years, it has been desired that an organic
electronic device such as electrophotographic photoreceptor,
organic electroluminescence device (herein-after sometimes
abbreviated to "organic EL device" ), organic transistor,
organic sensor and the like be capable of stably and efficiently
injecting electric charge from an electrode or charge
generating layer to a charge transporting layer. Examples of
such device capable of stably and efficiently injecting
electric charge include a device comprising a positive-hole
injecting layer having carbon black dispersed therein which
layer is interposed between a type-P photoconductor layer and a
supporting substrate (refer to Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-Open No.12848/1984) and a device improved in charge
injecting properties which comprises two divisional charge
transporting layers, whose layer on the side of a charge
generating layer is composed of a polymer layer having a
distyryl compound dispersed therein (refer to Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No.157660/1991). However, the above-mentioned
devices have been complicated in production because
of the necessity of adding a new layer to the device.In addition, there is disclosed an organic EL device
technology which enhances a positive-hole injecting efficiency
into an organic light-emitting layer by the use of a injecting
layer comprising an aromatic tertiary amine (refer to Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 295695/1988). Nevertheless
the above-disclosed device does not fully satisfy an electric
power conversion efficiency and light-emitting efficiency.
Thus, there is required an EL device capable of being driven by
a lower voltage in order to enhance the power conversion
efficiency and light-emitting efficiency of the device.There is also disclosed an organic EL device technology
which constitutes a light-emitting layer by mixing a
styrylamine derivative being a positive-hole transporting
material and also a light emitting material with an
