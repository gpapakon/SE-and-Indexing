Target for darts comprising

a frame with spokes (1) and bands (2) between which are located a number of
fields (3) in each of which is located a spring-loaded segment (4) capable of

axial movement,
and a contact plate (9) with contacts for the display of points scored in each
segment (4),
with at least one element (11, 31, 40) allocated to each segment (4) for making
contact with the contact plate (9) in the event of a scoring hit,
characterised in that

provided in the segments (4) and running transverse to their side walls (25) are
steel spindles (23, 24) which protrude beyond the side walls (25) of said

segments (4), and which are located in oblong holes of the spokes (1) and/or
bands (2) so as to permit a limited degree of movement.
Target for darts according to Claim 1, characterised in that the steel spindles
(23, 24) are connected to the segments (4) by an interference f
it preferably with
reinforcing raised or formed elements (26) being provided at the bearing points

of the steel spindles (23, 24) in the side walls (25) of the segments (4), said
steel spindles (23, 24) preferably protruding beyond the spokes (1) and/or

bands (2) only by an amount less than the tolerance of the segments (4) within
the fields (3).
Target for darts according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised by a contact frame
(27) connected to the steel spindles (23, 24), at which pins (11) for contacting

the contact plate (9) are arranged in preferably an integral single-piece 
construction, with snap connections (28, 29) preferably being provided at the

contact frame (27) for releasable latching with the steel spindles (23, 24).
Target for darts according to Claim 3, characterised by a rubber mat (10)
arranged between the pins (11) and the contact plate (9).
Target for darts according to Claim 3, characterised in that the contact frame
(27) is elastic, with raised, preferably cup-shaped, elements (30), which rest

against the contact plate (9), being provided preferably in the area of the steel
spindles (23, 24) at the rear of the contact frame (27), at the centre of which

raised elements (30) is located a raised contact point (31) for initiating the hit
score contact.
Target for darts according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the steel
spindles (23, 24) are fitted with spring elements (38) consisting of a first, spring

component (39) which, when in the rest position, is located under preload at
the contact plate (9) next to the contact point position (36), and a second

component (40) which, in the rest position, is located at a distance from the
contact position (36) and which, in the event of a hit score, initiates the

contact, this second component also being preferably elastic, and said spring
elements (38) furthermore being preferably axisymmetric.
Target for darts according to Claim 6, characterised in that the spring elements
(38) consist of rubber-like elastic bodies, preferably flexible plastics, with said

spring elements (38) preferably comprising two thickened sections (39, 40)
with an interposed section (41) in which the dimensions or diameter are

reduced.
Target for darts according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that
the segments (4) exhibit protrusions (33) pointing towards the rear, on each of

which is arranged an elastic contact cap (34) which initiates the hit score
contact. 
Target for darts according to Claim 8, characterised in that the contact cap (34)
exhibits a more protruding element (35) with which it is constantly supported

at the contact plate (9) adjacent to the contact position (36), and a less
protruding element (37) which, in the rest position, is separated from the

contact position (36) and which, in the event of a scoring hit, initiates the
contact.
