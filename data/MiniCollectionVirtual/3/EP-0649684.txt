<ABSTRACT>
Assembly for dispensing a liquid-to-pasty product, which includes a container (8) holding the product, a dispensing head (20) having a dispensing channel (21), the container (1) consisting of a material having a rigidity such that the dispensing of the product requires air uptake by the container, a pumping member having two valves, an inlet valve (33) and a dispensing valve (31), being provided for dispensing the product, the two-valve pumping member being of the type without air uptake: means being provided for establishing or preventing, at will, air uptake by the container (8). The dispensing head (20) possesses a plane bearing surface (20A) provided with a flexible diaphragm (30) defining a springy leaf (31) applied against the end of the plane part (20A) into which the dispensing channel (21) emerges.

the product, a dispensing head (20, 120; 220) having a
dispensing channel (21), the container (1, 101; 201) consisting

of a material having a rigidity such that the
dispensing of the product requires air uptake by the

container, a pumping member having two valves, an inlet
valve (33, 133, 233) and a dispensing valve (31; 231),

this being provided for dispensing the product, the two-valve
pumping member being of the type without air

uptake, means being provided for establishing or preventing,
at will, air uptake by the container (1, 101; 201),

characterized in that the dispensing head (20, 220)
possesses a bearing surface (20A; 220A) into which

emerges the terminal part, opening via an orifice onto
the outside, of the dispensing channel (21) passing

through the dispensing head (20; 220), which head bears,
in its upper part, a flexible diaphragm (30; 230) having

a bevelled profile defining a springy leaf (31; 231)
applied against that end of the plane part (20A; 220A)

into which the dispensing channel (21) emerges, covering
the said orifice of the dispensing channel.
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the bearing surface (20A) is plane and that its

plane is interrupted at the centre of the dispensing head
(20) by a hollowed region (50) extending down to a bottom

(20B) and forming a compression chamber (50) into which
the other end of the dispensing channel (21) emerges.
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the compression chamber (50) is bordered, on the

outside, by a dome (32) which the diaphragm (30) possesses
in line with the bottom (20B).
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that means are provided for establishing

or preventing, at will, communication between the dispensing
channel (21) and the container (1, 101; 201) and

are formed by the dispensing head (20, 120; 220) being
mounted so as to move with respect to the container, 

between two positions, a position for which the
dispensing channel (21) is in communication with the

container (1, 101) and a position for which the said
communication is closed.
Assembly according to Claims 3 and 4, characterized
in that the two positions of the dispensing head

(20, 120), relative to the container (1, 101), for which
positions the container is, or is not, in communication

with the atmosphere, are the same as those for which,
respectively, the dispensing channel (21) is, or is not,

in communication with the container (1, 101).
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the dispensing head (20, 120; 220)

is mounted so as to rotate with respect to the container
(1, 101; 201).
Assembly according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the container is a bottle (1, 101; 201) to which a

support (10, 110; 210) is fixed, the dispensing head
(20, 120; 220) being rendered axially integral with the

said support (10, 110; 210) and free to rotate with
respect to it.
Assembly according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the support (10, 110) possesses an internal cylindrical

outer skirt (13) housed in a sealed manner in the
annular space lying between an internal tubular part (23)

and an external tubular part (24) which the dispensing
head (20, 120) possesses.
Assembly according to Claims 6, 7 and 8, characterized
in that a port (18) passes through the wall of

the internal cylindrical outer skirt (13) of the support
(10, 110), the internal (23) and external (24) tubular

parts of the dispensing head (20, 120) being respectively
provided with a longitudinal slot (26) and with a passage

(27), these facing each other the passage (27) emerging
into the compression chamber (50) of the pumping member

and including the inlet valve (33), the internal
cylindrical inner skirt (13) of the support (10, 110) and

the internal tubular part [23) of the dispensing head
(20, 120) communicating with the container (1, 101), the 

longitudinal slot (26) and the passage (27) being placed
so as to face the port (18) in that position of the

dispensing head (20, 120) with respect to the support
(10, 110) for which communication between the compression

chamber (50) of the pumping member and the container
(1, 101), and therefore between the dispensing channel

(21) and the container (1, 101), is open.

by another axial groove (28) provided in the outer

surface of the outer tubular part (24) of the dispensing
head (20, 120) and emerging on the outside of the container

(1, 101).
Assembly according to Claim 1, in which the
dispensing head is mounted so as to rotate with respect

to the container, characterized in that the dispensing
head comprises a ferrule (222) mounted so as to rotate on

a support (210) fixed to the neck of the container, this
ferrule (222) making it possible to open or close an air-uptake

hole (53) in the container, and possessing, in its
central part, a valve-piston (233) interacting with a

pumping chamber (250) formed in a push-button (65) on top
