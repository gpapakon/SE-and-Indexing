<ABSTRACT>
This invention is intended to effect torque control of 
high accuracy by detecting the oil pressure at the time of 

the generation of a pulse which forms the basis of the 
generated torque for a torque wrench and using the data 

thus obtained to effect torque control. 
Oil pressure pulses generated in a pulse generating 
mechanism (3) by the rotation of an air motor (1) 

are transmitted to a hydraulic cylinder (4) by a piston (33), a 
rod (36) and a piston (35). In addition, a pressure sensor (5) 

installed in the hydraulic cylinder (34) detects the oil 
pressure pulses and its signal is used to switch a 

switching valve (7), whereupon a stopping switching valve (9) 
and a stopping differential pressure valve (8) are 

successively switched, stopping the feeding of air to the 
air motor (1) while cutting off the passage of electric 

current from a battery (61) to an electric control circuit (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
an oil pressure type pulse wrench including
an autoshut-off mechanism for
controlling the torque in the shaft of a torque wrench.A torque wrench using an air motor as a power source is
provided with a shut-off mechanism adapted to stop the
rotation of the motor when a bolt or nut has been seated by
a predetermined value of torque. The autoshut-off
mechanism which develops this function operates on the
principle of detecting the stoppage or reversal of rotation
of the rotor by means of an inertial body connected to the
rotor, the movement of said inertial body opening an air
feed valve to feed air to an air timer, then shutting off
the feeding of air to the air motor after the lapse of
given time after the start of seating.Further, Japanese Utility Model Application Disclosure
No. 40076/1991 discloses an autoshut-off device for a
torque wrench adapted to intermittently transmit the
rotational output from an air motor and including a pulse
generating mechanism which produces an oil pressure pulse
each time the torque is imparted to the main shaft, said 
autoshut-off device being characterized in that the oil
pressure in the high pressure producing side of said
mechanism acts on a relief valve, so that the latter is
opened when said oil pressure exceeds a set pressure by
the spring pressure of said relief valve, the then-prevailing
oil pressure being used to stop the rotation of
the air motor.In the two prior art examples described above, the
former, though capable of providing some degree of torque
accuracy, is not so designed as to monitor the produced
torque to actuate the autoshut-off device by said
generated torque; therefore, there has been a problem that
the torque accuracy is readily influenced by the
performance of the torque wrench itself or by the operating
conditions.In the latter, since an oil pressure pulse can be
generated only in a very short time, there is a drawback
that the oil pressure often fails to be transmitted to a
bolt or nut to serve as a tightening force. Further, since
the air motor will be stopped if the oil pressure in the
high pressure producing side becomes higher than the spring
pressure of the relief valve, only the lower limit of the
generated torque is monitored; there has been a problem
that a variation in the performance of machine parts, such
as springs, unstabilizes the operating accuracy.An oil pressure type pulse wrench including the features of the first
part of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0 502 748.This invention has been accomplised
