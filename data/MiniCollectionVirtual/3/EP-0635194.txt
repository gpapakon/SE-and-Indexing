<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a combined soil-working and sowing machine (1) in which the seed drill (5) is intended to rest, during transport, on the central part (34) of the chassis (6) of the machine for preparing the seed-bed (4) with the aid of at least one central limit stop (59). The combined machine (1) according to the invention is characterised in that, in transport, the seed drill (5) rests from above partially on the said chassis (6) by means of at least two lateral limit stops (61) respectively situated on either side of and beyond the central limit stop or stops (59), preferably at least substantially in the vicinity of each longitudinal end of the said chassis (6).

additionally partially on the said chassis (6) by means of at least two
lateral stops (61) located respectively on each side of and beyond the

central stop(s) (59), preferably at least approximately near each
longitudinal end of the said chassis (6).
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 1,
characterized in that it includes at least one adjusting device (374) for

adjusting the distribution of the weight of the seeder (5) between the central
stop(s) (59) and the lateral stops (61).

characterized in that the said adjusting device (374) includes a

continuous-adjustment device (375) of the type comprising screw (377) and
nut (376), for example. 
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to one or more of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the press roller (10) is connected to the

chassis (6) by means of connecting devices (11) and that each connecting
device (11) rests, during transport, on the respective lateral stop (61) of the

said chassis (6).
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 4,
characterized in that each connecting device (11) extends near to one

corresponding longitudinal end of the chassis (6).
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 4 or 5,
characterized in that the seeder (5) includes a frame (29) supporting the

hopper (25) of the said seeder (5) and connected to the chassis (6) by means
of a guide structure (42) which, during work, allows an upwards movement

of the chassis (6) with respect to the said frame (29).
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the guide structure (42) includes at least one rod (44)

extending directly or indirectly between the frame (29) and the chassis (6).
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 6 or 7,
characterized in that the frame (29) rests on each connecting device (11)

during work and during transport by means of a corresponding outer
connection (63; 163; 263) which has two contact surfaces (60, 64; 160, 164;

260, 264).
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 8,
characterized in that, in side view, each outer connection (63; 163; 263)

extends at least approximately vertically to the axis of rotation (10A) of the
press roller (10). 
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 8 or 9,
characterized in that each outer connection (163) includes a roller (167)

which reduces the friction forces between the frame (29) and the said
connecting device (11) as the chassis (6) moves heightwise with respect to

the seeder (5).
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 8 or 9,
characterized in that each outer connection (263) includes a cylindrical

articulation (268), the axis pivoting of which is at least approximately
parallel to the axis of rotation (10A) of the press roller (10), the connecting

devices (11) of the press roller (10) playing a part in guiding the seeder (5)
with respect to the chassis (6).
Combined soil-working and seeding machine according to Claim 11,
characterized in that each cylindrical articulation (268) consists of a journal
