<ABSTRACT>
The clamping device has a base (1) and a work carrier (2) which can be firmly clamped to the base (1) and on which orientation elements (5, 10, 27, 28) are arranged which interact in pairs and orientate the work carrier (2) in three coordinate axes perpendicular to one another and at the correct angle to the base (1). With their clamping force, several clamping members (4, 11) hold the work carrier (2) on the base (1) in the position secured by the orientation elements. Each clamping member has a chuck (4) at the base (1) and a clamping stem (11) at the work carrier (2). There are stop faces (27, 28) opposite one another as orientation elements for securing the position in a coordinate axis (Z) parallel to the line of action of the clamping force. In order to arrange the construction of the work carrier (2) to be as simple and inexpensive as possible, the same, on the side (9) facing the base (1) in the clamped state, has a continuously plane surface which in certain areas forms the stop faces (27) on this side and to which the orientation elements (10) on this side for securing the coordinate axes as well as the clamping stem (11) are fastened.

Device for the induced clamping of a workpiece on a 
workstation of a machine tool, with a support (1) to be fixed on 

the workstation of the machine tool and a workpiece carrier (2) 
able to be placed on the support and able to be clamped thereto, 

furthermore with alignment members (5, 10, 27, 28) on the 
support and on the workpiece carrier, which cooperate in pairs 

as alignment members and align the workpiece carrier along three 
coordinate axes (X, Y, Z) at right angles to each other and at 

the correct angle on the support, and With a chucking device (4, 
11), whereof the clamping force retains the workpiece carrier (2) 

on the support (1) in the position determined by the alignment 
members, whereby as pairs of alignment members for fixing the 

position along a coordinate axis (Z) parallel to the line of 
application of the clamping force, opposing stop faces (27, 28) 

are present on the support and on the workpiece carrier, whereas 
for fixing the position along the two other coordinate axes (X, 

Y) for each coordinate axis, two pairs of linear alignment 
members (5, 10) are provided separately, which each comprise a 

wedge-shaped centring rule (30) and a counterpart (40) with a 
matching centring slot (43), and the chucking device comprising 

several clamping members (4, 11), which each comprise a clamping 
journal (11) located on the workpiece carrier (2) and a chuck (4) 

located on the support (1), characterized in that on the side (9) 
facing the support (1) in the clamped state, the workpiece 

carrier (2) comprises a continuous flat surface, which in certain 
regions forms the stop faces (28) on this side and to which the 

linear alignment members (10) on this side for fixing the 
coordinate axes (X, Y, Z) as well as the clamping journals (11) 

of the clamping members (4, 11) are attached. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
workpiece carrier (2) is formed by a plate (7) with plane 

parallel side faces (8, 9). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the plate 
(7) comprises throughholes for the insertion of screws (21, 13) 

for fastening the linear alignment members (10) on this side and 
the clamping journals (11).  

 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
fastening screws (12, 13) have a radial clearance in the 

respective throughholes. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the stop 
faces associated with the support (1) are annular surfaces (27) 

offset from the surface of the support, which are respectively 
arranged concentrically with respect to a chuck 4 and directly 

adjoin its movement space for the clamping journals (11). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in that the 
surface area of each annular surface (27) is several times 

greater than that of the cross section of a clamping journal (11) 
at the point of its longitudinal extent subject to the greatest 

stress. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the support (1) comprises a plate-like 

housing (3) with a four-cornered base, in which four chucks (4) 
with a ball-locking mechanism are located and arranged centrally 

symmetrically in the four corners of the housing 3. 
Device according to Claims 5 and 7, characterized in that 
the chucks each comprise a clamping sleeve (14) provided with 

locking balls (19), which clamping sleeves project beyond the 
housing (3) and whereof the end faces form the stop faces (27) 

of the support (1). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the counterpart (10) of the pairs of linear 

alignment members, cooperating with the wedge-shaped centring 
rule (30), for the fixing of the coordinate axes (X, Y, Z)

Z-axis, but rigid at right angles to the Z-axis, in which part 

(42) the centring slot (43) is located. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in that the part 
(42) comprising the centring slot (43) is located in the centre 

of the counterpart (10) between two attachment bars (41) and is

Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the wedge-shaped centring rules (30) have 

a prismatic construction, are inserted in grooves (31) and
