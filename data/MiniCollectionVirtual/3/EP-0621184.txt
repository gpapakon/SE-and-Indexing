<ABSTRACT>
A stretch wrapping apparatus includes a dispenser for dispensing 
stretch wrap packaging material. The dispenser includes 

upstream and downstream prestretch rollers for engaging 
and stretching stretch wrap packaging material. The 

dispenser also includes an intermediate orienting roller 
position between the upstream and downstream prestretch rollers. 

The intermediate orienting roller abuts one of the 
upstream and downstream prestretch rollers, and is spaced 

from the other of the upstream and downstream prestretch 
rollers. Relative rotation is provided between the dispenser 

and the load to wrap the stretch wrap packaging material 
around the load.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to stretch wrapping apparatus
having prestretch rollers which stretch packaging material
before wrapping a load.Stretch wrapping is a packaging technique which dispenses
and wraps a web of stretch wrap packaging material in a
stretched condition around the load to cover and contain the
load.Early stretch wrapping techniques positioned the load
on a turntable and fastened the leading end of the web of
stretch wrap packaging material to the load or the turntable.
As the turntable rotated, the roll of stretch film was
restrained by a brake to stretch the packaging material in
the direction in which it was being dispensed as the packaging
material was wrapped around the load. A similar stretch
wrapping technique revolved a film web dispenser around a
stationary load to wrap the stretched film around the load. FR-A-2 606 365 deals with a stretch wrapping apparatus
according to the preamble of claims 1, said apparatus comprising
a frame assembly (wherein the load to be
wrapped is located), a support for the dispenser of the
film web, and two spindles (rotating with respect to the said
support) carrying two rollers which are connected together
by the mean of a pulley and a leather strap. The apparatus
is also constituted by a counter-roller, a roller to invert
the rotation and the means necessary to release the
apparatus and to stop the traction of the film. As the field of stretch wrapping developed, Lantech
invented a stretch wrapping apparatus which employed a film
web dispenser having two closely spaced rollers to stretch a
web of thermoplastic stretch film packaging material. Such
rollers are known as prestretch rollers. The downstream prestretch
roller has a faster surface speed than the upstream 
prestretch roller. This stretches the packaging material
between the upstream and downstream prestretch rollers in
the dispensing direction.These closely spaced prestretch rollers were driven by
the demand for film web by the load and were sometimes assisted
by an electrical motor. In one arrangement, the two
prestretch rollers included sprockets which were connected
by an endless chain to cause the downstream prestretch roller
to have a faster surface speed than the upstream roller
and thereby stretch the web of stretch film over its yield
point in the dispensing direction.It is preferable that a stretch wrapping apparatus with
prestretch rollers have the following features. The upstream
and downstream prestretch rollers should be closely spaced
during operation to prevent neckdown of the
