<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a primary uniform heater in the natural temperature 
preserving main body (100,200) and it is conducted to a room needed to be 

heated, where the temperature can disperse openly; the temperature is 
transferred by the heat-conductive fluid by a main pump (104,204), or further 

by a shunt pump; that is, fresh air enters into the primary uniform 
air-heater through an open filtered inlet, and enter the primary uniform 

heater of the natural temperature preserving main body (100,200) and then 
it is pumped through a transfering tube (102) to a detector in the room needed 

to be heated. If the conductive tube (102) is long enough to be buried in 
the natural temperature preserving main body (100,200), the primary uniform 

heater (101,201) can be omitted and the tube (102) is made of good conductive 
materials to actuate the function of a primary uniform heating power; a 

primary filter (106,206), such as active carbon filter, tester for harmful 
gas (1081), and air fresher, can be attached to the inlet and the outlet of 

the fresh air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an open-cycle system for supplying air to, and
regulating the temperature of, a region.Conventional room temperature regulating systems such as an air conditioner, for
example, use a refrigerant compressor as the main basis for reducing the temperature.
Conventional air-heaters use electric power or, alternatively, burn materials in order to
produce heat, thereby wasting a lot of energy in order to condition the temperature of a
room; they also produce a great deal of pollution from exhaust heat and materials. The
more recent conditioners, for example, ice-preserving types, use off-peak electrical power
to freeze water into ice, and then use the peak power to melt the ice through a
temperature-preserving tube in order to achieve the required temperature. This type of
ice-preserving air-conditioner, however, has many disadvantages, needing a substantial
amount of space for a bulky freezer and a well-insulated refrigerator as well as requiring
input energy. The present invention is able to use the surface and subsequent layers of
the earth's surface, and also ponds, lakes and rivers as a naturally-occurring body in order
to preserve temperature.As a result of providing the room to be air conditioned with air from the natural
body, the temperature and pressure of the air within the room will be similar to that of the
natural body. As a result, the positive pressure will reduce the dust that has settled on
doors and windows, while keeping the air free from pollution.In the event of a city being situated in a basin, the resultant positive pressure will
have the effect of dispersing the new uncontaminated air through convection.Tests have shown that, in winter and in summer, at depths of 10-50 metres, the
surface layers of the earth are seldom affected by the temperature on the earth's surface
due to its heat capacity being very large. Similarly, sea water, lakes and rivers on the
earth's surface are also able to preserve a constant temperature below a certain depth. In
the description of the invention, these parts of earth's surface will be referred to as a
"naturally-occurring body". Due to the fact that the naturally-occurring body has a large
heat capacity, its temperature is always lower than that of the air on the surface of the 
earth during the summer; the river water temperature is usually below 15°C. In winter
however, and in particular in areas of high latitude, where the earth's surface
temperature is often between -20°C and -30°C, the naturally-occurring body will
