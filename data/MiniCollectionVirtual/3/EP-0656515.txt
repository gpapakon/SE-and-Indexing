<ABSTRACT>
According to a method for controlling dryers in the ceramic industry, which are operated with an external and/or internal heating and are operated in conjunction with a tunnel furnace, and in which, by means of an empirical or mathematical model of the drying process, the state of drying-out of the chambers is approximately determined, the variation of the air condition values and/or of the convection capacity of the individual chambers is automatically selected or calculated as a function of the products, the available drying time and the available furnace waste heat, from the point of view of a minimum total energy or energy cost expenditure, and is started as a drying programme. This mode of operation achieves an automatic optimisation of the heat consumption in a targeted manner, using the prescribed boundary conditions, and, as a result, the costs of energy and personnel are reduced in a concern without large investment in terms of installation being necessary.

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling chamber dryers with a multiplicity of chambers used
in the ceramics industry, which are operated with an external and/or internal

heating system and in association with the heating system of a tunnel kiln, and

characterised by the following process steps:

measurement of the equilibrium temperature of the air in each chamber
shortly after the chamber has been loaded with green bricks,
calculation of the shortest drying time taking account of the maximum
drying speed of the green bricks,
commencement of the drying program for each individual chamber,
automatic selection or calculation of the drying program with consideration
for the measured equilibrium temperature, the calculated drying time and/or

the convection power of the individual chambers depending on the green
bricks, the available drying time and the available waste heat from the kiln

from the point of view of achieving a minimum overall energy/energy cost
expenditure.

approximate degree, by means of the empirical or physical mathematical

model of the drying process,
creation (under program control) of a drying program with optimised energy

expenditure for drying and/or the combined energy consumed by the tunnel

kiln and the dryer.
The method in accordance with Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that,

a specified production program is first used for predicting the variations in the
energy demand of the dryer and the variations in the heat output from the

tunnel kiln are predicted by means of a model of the tunnel kiln and that the

specified by the company.
The method in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that,
 
a raw material model is incorporated into the drying model in order to

determine the maximum drying speed and the dependence of this speed on
the temperature for a specified production geometry and for one or more

drying sections, in which the raw material model for a given raw material at
least includes the dependency of the drying speed on the geometry and/or on

the temperature in the first drying section.
The method in accordance Claim 4,
characterised in that,

the drying and the raw material models are used for deriving the variations in
the air status and convection values at the maximum drying speed permitted

for the raw material or the maximum drying speed which can be achieved by
the process.
The method in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that,

the variations in the air status and/or convection values in the individual
chambers for achieving the optimum energy characteristics are determined by

establishing the optimum extreme drying times, i.e. the shortest and longest
possible drying times under optimum energy conditions, preferably by means

of a linear interpolation of the air status and/or convection values. 
The method in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
,

the most favourable drying program is selected from a number of pre-optimised
drying programs.

characterised in that,

the green brick temperature is included in the process of determining the
energy curve with the most favourable energy characteristics.
The method in accordance with Claim 8,
characterised in that,

in order to determine the temperature of the green bricks, the chamber is
operated only with circulation and without any heat input for a long enough

time to establish the status of equilibrium, at which point the equilibrium
temperature of the air is measured and this value is used directly or with a

correction factor to take account of the fluctuations in the temperatures of the
green bricks and the temperature variations prior to charging.
The method in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that,
 
a conductivity measurement is taken as a secondary parameter for detecting

or checking the process of drying, in particular for detecting the end of the first
stage of drying, with this measurement involving a measurement of the current

between two metal carriers upon which green bricks are placed.

detecting or checking the process of drying, in particular for detecting the end
