<ABSTRACT>
A process for removal of manganese from water which includes the steps of (i) preparing a fluidised bed of particles (eg. magnetite) in a bioreactor capable of adsorbing a strongly adherent biofilm of microorganisms (e.g. pedomicrobium manganicum) metabolising manganese to provide an actively propagated biomass, and (ii) passing a stream of water through the fluidised bed where manganese is adsorbed by said biomass and is thus removed from the stream of water to provide a purified effluent of water exiting from the bioreactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a method and 
apparatus for removal of manganese from water and in 
particular potable or drinking water. The presence of manganese in drinking water 
constitutes a problem for many water authorities both in 
Australia (references 26 and 48 referred to hereinafter 
in the LIST OF REFERENCES) and overseas (4,62) as a cause 
of manganese-related "dirty water" in urban distribution 
systems. Manganese entering the distribution system 
accumulates as a black manganese oxide biofilm on pipe 
surfaces and causes consumer complaints when it sloughs 
off (4, 26, 48, 51, 52, 53, 62). In a chlorinated 
drinking water system the manganese oxide may be 
deposited chemically or may be accumulated by viable 
bacterial biofilms which develop in areas with 
insufficient chlorination (48, 51, 52, 53). The manganese-related "dirty water" is not 
associated with any known health risk but the water is 
aesthetically unacceptable and causes economic losses by 
irreversible staining of washing, equipment, manufactured 
goods and swimming pools. The problem is widespread in Australia with 
many cities and towns along the east coast from Cairns in 
North Queensland to Wyong and Woolongong in New South 
Wales experiencing problems. Many of these coastal towns 
rely on tourism as their major industry and are expected 
to maintain high standards for their tourist image. In 
1985, the most affected area was the Gold Coast in southeast 
Queensland where consumer complaints reached as high 
as 870 per week (48, 51, 53). Most water authorities aim through various 
water treatment strategies to reduce manganese in  
 
drinking water to the WHO and NHMRC recommended level of 
0.05 mg/l (41,62). The American Water Works Association 
goal level is 0.01 mg/l (4). A recent extensive study (48, 51, 52, 53) of 
the Gold Coast water distribution system has shown that 
manganese-related consumer complaints occur when 
manganese levels reach 0.02 mg/l and approaches 80 per 
week when levels rise to 0.05 mg/l. These consumer 
complaints are only an indication of the total number of 
consumers affected. Current water treatment methods for the removal 
of manganese and iron from raw water supplies are 
destratification and oxygenation of the raw water supply 
(46,61) and chemical oxidation at the treatment plant 
followed by filtration (61). The most commonly used 
oxidants are KMnO4, chlorine, chlorine dioxide and ozone 
(61). A survey of treatment plants by Green (24) 
indicates that the use of sand filters as a

A process for removal of manganese from water 
which includes the steps of: 


(i) preparing a fluidised bed of particles in 
a bioreactor, said particles being capable of adsorbing a 

strongly adherent biofilm of microorganisms capable of 
metabolising manganese to provide an actively propagating 

biomass; and 
(ii) passing a stream of water through the 
fluidised bed where manganese is adsorbed by said biomass 

and is thus removed from the stream of water to provide a 
purified effluent of water exiting from the bioreactor. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
particle size of the particles in the fluidised bed is of 

the range 50 µm to 1000 µm. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
microorganisms are strains of 
Pedomicrobium manganicum.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
microorganisms are supported on magnetite particles. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
biomass is maintained at a pH of 7.8 in step (ii). 
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
magnetite particles have a particle size of approximately 

200-300 µm diameter. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
water is passed through the bioreactor continuously and 

also through a mixing vessel whereby fresh influent is 
passed into said mixing vessel at approximately the same 

rate as effluent or treated water is passed out of the 
mixing vessel to a receptacle for treated water. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the 
mixing vessel is subject to aeration. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein a 
first recirculation pump is used to pump water from the 

bioreactor to the mixing vessel. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein a 
second recirculation pump is also used to pump water from  

 
the mixing vessel to the bioreactor. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a 
multiplicity of bioreactors in series are utilized in 

step (i) wherein water is passed from one bioreactor to 
provide an effluent low in manganese concentration. 
A process as claimed in claim 11, wherein a 
mixing vessel is used which is in liquid communication 

with each bioreactor in the series. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
purified effluent is passed out of the top of the 

bioreactor.
