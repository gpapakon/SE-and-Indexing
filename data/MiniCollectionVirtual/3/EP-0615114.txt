<ABSTRACT>
A combinational weighing machine has weigh hoppers for 
weighing articles, a dispersion feeder for dispersing articles 

to be weighed, supply troughs for supplying articles from the 
dispersion feeder to the weigh hoppers and a control unit for 

controlling overall operations of the machine inclusive of 
combining weight values outputted from the weigh hoppers and 

discharging articles from selected ones of these weigh 
hoppers. The weighing machine is placed inside a washing 

device which forms a closed chamber inside and covers the 
weighing machine from all its four sides as well as from 

above. Nozzles for emitting warm water and a cleaning liquid 
are provided inside this chamber such that the liquids are 

prevented from splashing the work areas around the machine. 
The washing device may be lifted and kept away from the 

weighing machine during a normal mode of operation of the 
latter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a weighing system comprising
a combinational weighing machine of a kind with a plurality of
article-supplying means and weigh hoppers, and a,
washing device.As disclosed in the JP-A-63-30725,
for example, combinational weighing machines are used for the
purpose of gathering several pieces of articles with
individually fluctuating weights such as candies, fruits and
vegetables such that their total weight will be equal to, or
very close to a specified target weight. Fig. 9 shows an
example of such a combinational weighing machine, indicated
generally by numeral 1 and having a conveyor 12 for dropping
articles to be weighed to the center of a dispersion feeder 2.
A plural number of supply troughs 3 are arranged around the
periphery of the dispersion feeder 2. Each supply trough 3
can be vibrated by a vibrator 3a associated with it so as to
deliver the articles received from the dispersion feeder 2 at
one of its ends to corresponding one of pool hoppers 4 at the 
other of its ends. Each pool hopper 4 is provided with a gate
5 and has a weigh hopper 6 associated with it situated below
it. Each weigh hopper 6 is provided with a weighing device 7
and a gate 8, and there is a collector chute 9 below the gates
8 of the weigh hoppers 6. Weight values of articles outputted
from the weigh hoppers 6 are variously combined to determine a
particular combination such that the sum of its weight values
is equal to, or satisfactorily close to a predetermined target
weight. As shown in Fig. 10, each gate 5 or 8 of the hopper 4
or 6 is adapted to be opened and closed by means of a pushing
member 10 which moves backward and forward and thereby serves
to push one end lla of a linking mechanism 11 for the gate 5
or 8.The inner surfaces of the supply troughs 3 and the hoppers 4
and 6 of the weighing machine 1, as shown in Fig. 9, must be
cleaned whenever vegetables, for example, of a different kind
are going to be weighed because otherwise the articles to
be weighed come into contact. It has been a customary
routine, therefore, to remove the supply troughs 3 and the
hoppers 4 and 6 from the weighing machine 1 and transport them
to a separately provided washing device to have them cleaned
therein. Since most combinational weighing machines use many
supply troughs and hoppers, it is a cumbersome process to
remove them and install them again. In view of the above, the JP-A-2-161324
(corresponding to EP-A-0 353 751), for example, discloses a cleaning device which does
not require the troughs or the

A weighing system comprising a combinational weighing machine (1) comprising a
plurality of weigh hoppers (4, 6) for weighing articles

therein, a feeder (2, 3) for supplying articles to said
weigh hoppers (4, 6), said combinational weighing machine

(1) being adapted to combine weight values outputted from
said weigh hoppers (4, 6), and a washing device (20) comprising

means (22, 23, 24, 50) for covering all four sides and top
of said combinational weighing machine (1) to thereby form a

washing chamber (21) and liquid-emitting nozzles (25) inside
said washing chamber (21).
A weighing system according to claim 1,
wherein said feeder (2, 3) comprises a dispersion feeder (2)

for dispersing articles to be weighed and supply troughs (3)
for supplying articles from said dispersion feeder to said

weigh hoppers and wherein control means (45) are provided
for controlling overall operations of said weighing machine

(1) inclusive of combining weight values outputted from said
weigh hoppers (4
, 6) and discharging articles from selected
ones of said weigh hoppers (4, 6).
A weighing system according to claim 1 or
2, wherein said washing chamber (21) has an opening (24a)

formed above said weighing machine (1). 
A weighing system according to any of
claims 1 to 3, wherein said combinational weighing machine (1) further comprises a chute (9) for collecting

articles dropped from said weigh hoppers (4,6), and said washing
device (20) further comprises an article receiver (29) for

receiving from said chute (9) articles collected thereby and
a liquid receiver (31) for receiving discharged liquid from

said chute (9), said article and liquid receivers (29,31)
being supported so as to be horizontally movable.
A weighing system according to any of
