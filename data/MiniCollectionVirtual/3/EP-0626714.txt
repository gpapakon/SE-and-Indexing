<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the costs of assembled printed 
circuit boards, a printed board fuse (1) has been developed, 

which functions with great reliability at low manufacturing 
costs. By coating a large area of a printed board with 

metal, for example, by plating, a well-defined thickness of 
a metal layer (9) may be achieved in which a fuse (3) has 

been separated. The well-defined thickness also allows well-defined 
geometry of the fuse cross-sectional area and fuse 

length to be achieved and therefore its resistance and 
interruption characteristics will also be very accurately 

defined. In case of a temperature rise, the metal layer (9) 
surrounding the fuse (3) will have a heat dissipating effect 

on the fuse, implying an essentially reduced risk of board 
fire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a 
device for protecting a printed board against overcurrents 
by mounting thereon a printed board fuse which will interrupt 
the current in case of overcurrents. From, for example, EP-A1 0 270 954 describing the closest prior art, there is previously 
known a chip-type fuse which may be used mounted on 
and connected to a printed circuit board/printed board. Said 
chip-type fuse comprises an insulating member, such as an 
insulating substrate having a pair of metallic electrodes of 
thin-film type disposed thereon, between which a current 
sensitive conductor is connected. Should an overcurrent pass 
through the fuse, the conductor will melt and the current 
will be interrupted. In order to prevent, in case of the 
conductor melting because of an overcurrent, a generated 
metal vapour from being set free and spreading and also to 
prevent arc discharge, the conductor is coated with a protective 
silicone resin film. Despite the small size of the 
fuse, the insulating member/substrate permits high current 
intensities. For increased sensitivity, the chip-type fuse 
may optionally be provided with trimmed portions which would 
more easily melt in case of an overcurrent. From FR-A 2 053 881 there is previously known a 
similar fuse for printed circuits/printed boards. It is made 
according to the technique for printed circuits or rather by 
means of a method for analogue circuits such as metal 
coating, electroplating or attachment of a metallic film. 
The fuse is characterized in that the conductive current 
sensitive circuit contains a plurality of spaced apart 
constricted areas adjacent extended conductive surfaces. In 
the case of a temperature rise in the constricted areas, the 
substrate will not be affected since the constricted areas 
are located adjacent the extended conductive surfaces, which  
 
are exposed to the air so that the heat may be dissipated. In order to reduce the costs of printed board 
assemblies, a printed board fuse has been developed which 
functions with great reliability at very low manufacturing 
costs. By coating a large area of a printed board with 
metal, for example electrolytically, a well-defined thickness 
of a metal layer may be achieved in which a fuse of, 
for example, square-wave type has been separated. The well-defined 
thickness also allows a well-defined geometry of the 
printed board fuse to be achieved. A prerequisite for a well 
functioning fuse, which works in a similar way on boards 
with different layouts,
