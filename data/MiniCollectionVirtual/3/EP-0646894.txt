<ABSTRACT>
A memory card includes a circuit substrate (14) 
having a generally planar surface (20) with at least one 

electrical component (22) mounted thereon. The component 
has a given height which projects a vertical distance from 

the substrate. A frame has an opening (32, 37) in one of 
a top or a bottom wall (33, 39) thereof for receiving the 

circuit substrate. A support structure on the frame 
supports the circuit substrate within the card. A cover 

(36) closes the opening and encloses the circuit substrate 
and the electrical component within the internal card space 

created by the frame and cover. The support structure 
includes a plurality of shelves (40, 42, 44) at different 

vertical locations within the frame to support the circuit 
substrate at different vertical levels to accommodate 

varying heights of electrical components mounted on one or 
both surfaces of the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of IC 
cards and, particularly, to a memory card which has a frame 
for supporting circuit substrates therewithin at different 
levels to accommodate different configurations of 
electrical components on the substrate. Generally, IC cards, such as memory cards, are 
data input devices which are electrically connected to an 
electronic apparatus or storage device, such as a word 
processor, personal computer or other electronic apparatus. 
The data or memory stored in the card is transferred to the 
electronic apparatus. Typically, the cards are portable 
instruments which are readily insertable and extractable 
from a connector apparatus used for removably coupling the 
card to a printed circuit board of the underlying 
electronic apparatus. A memory card conventionally includes a frame 
which is generally rectangular and may include an opening 
in either a top surface or a bottom surface thereof or, in 
most constructions, in both surfaces. The opening receives 
a circuit substrate, and a panel or cover closes the 
opening and encloses the circuit substrate within the 
frame. The circuit substrate of the memory card 
typically has a generally planar surface with at least one 
electrical component mounted thereon. The electrical 
component(s) may include semi-conductor devices, integrated 
circuits, batteries or the like. Such components extend or  
 
project vertically a given height off the substrate 
surface. Consequently, it has been common practice to 
design the frame of the memory card with support means for 
supporting the circuit substrate at particular vertical 
heights or levels within the frame to accommodate the 
different heights of electrical components. The substrates 
are "offset" toward the top cover or bottom cover to make 
"headroom" for the components. In other words, the circuit 
substrate must be supported within the frame so that the 
electrical components on the substrate do not project out 
of the frame or beyond the internal card space created by 
the cover or panel. This criteria further is complicated 
when different size electrical components are mounted on 
both sides of the circuit substrate. Therefore, it can be understood that different 
frames have to be manufactured with different "offsets" to 
receive and support circuit substrates having electrical 
components of varying heights mounted thereon, or circuit 
substrates which have components mounted on both sides of 
the substrate, notwithstanding the fact that the overall
