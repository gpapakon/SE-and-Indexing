<ABSTRACT>
A method for inhibiting corrosion in an aqueous 
medium is disclosed. The method comprises incorporating 

into the medium an amount of a water-soluble corrosion 
inhibitor sufficient to inhibit corrosion. The corrosion 

inhibitor comprises an N-ethoxy,2-substituted 
imidazoline, the N-ethoxy substituent having from one to 

about thirty ethoxy units and the 2-substituent being an 
unsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty chain of from about 

six to about thirty carbons. If the medium is sweet, the 
inhibitor further comprises a phosphate ester derived 

from a water-soluble oxyethylated, straight chain alcohol 
of from about two to about thirty carbons. Corrosion 

inhibitor compositions useful in such method are also 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to corrosion
inhibition and more particularly to inhibition of
corrosion in environmentally sensitive aqueous media.Corrosion of metal surfaces in aqueous media has
long been an intractable problem. This problem is
especially troublesome in deep sea operations such as
off-shore oil production, where corrosion inhibitors must
satisfy several criteria in order to be effective in the
demanding conditions encountered in such operations. A
number of corrosion inhibitors have been developed in
attempts to satisfy the demands imposed by such
activities. However, because it is difficult to meet
each of several independent corrosion inhibition
criteria, these efforts have met with varying, but not
totally satisfactory, success.Nevertheless, increasing environmental concerns have
introduced even further criteria for corrosion inhibitors
to satisfy. In particular, the corrosion inhibitor
should be compatible with the sensitive life forms
indigenous to the medium into which the inhibitor is
incorporated.For example, in North Sea operations, survival not
only of fish, but also, for instance, of algae and the
microorganism Skeletonema costatum is of concern. Thus, 
environmental constraints have been imposed on the types
of compositions used in the North Sea, thereby to protect
such organisms. However, commonly available commercial
inhibitors have been found to be too toxic to the
organism. More specifically, even a concentration of
less than one part per million by weight (ppm) of
conventional inhibitors has been found to retard growth
of Skeletonema costatum test populations by 50% in
96 hours. This may be written as EC50 < 1 ppm. Thus, a
corrosion inhibitor having an EC50 greater than 1 ppm is
desired.In addition, it is desired that the inhibitor meet
several other environmental criteria as well. For
example, the inhibitor should be sufficiently
biodegradable so that within 28 days after treatment, the
inhibitor has degraded at least 70% in terms of the
theoretical oxygen consumption required for complete
degradation (i.e.; the biochemical oxygen demand
BOD-28 â‰¥ 70%). Of course, it is more desirable that
complete degradation occur within 28 days. That is, the
goal is BOD-28 = 100%.Further, the water-solubility of the inhibitor
should be sufficient to avoid or to minimize
bio-accumulation that otherwise can result with fat
soluble inhibitors in lower life forms. The fat soluble
inhibitors may become more concentrated as they move up
the food chain. This may be quantified by measuring
