Method of echo processing between two
transmission pathways exhibiting coupling there-between,

comprising the determination of an echo
estimated on the basis of the signal received on one of

the pathways and of the estimated coupling between the
pathways, by self-adaptive digital transverse filtering

regulated by a predetermined clock frequency,
characterized in that, at each clock cycle (i) both a

calculation for adapting a coefficient of the filter
(h
t
(i)) and an elementary calculation of the
convolution between the signal received (x(t)) and the

impulse response represented by the coefficients of the
filter are performed.
