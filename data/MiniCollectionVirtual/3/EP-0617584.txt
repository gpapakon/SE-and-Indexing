<DESCRIPTION>
My invention relates to a chair like stool for floor work. According to the present innovation for floor work we intend any type 
of interior floor that a person has to carry out such as parquets laying, tiling, 
laying of floor linings, floor cleaning work, hydraulic work within the floor, 
decorative floor workings, etc. It is known that the above mentioned work types and similar the 
persons undertaking these operations, work with a curved back resulting in 
back-ache within a few hours of maintaining such a position. The operators prefer working on their knees however even in these 
conditions the knees after a little time start to hurt. It is also known that due to the laying of cobblestone, for example such 
as road porphyry, the operators, to avoid to these drawbacks, use a stool 
endowed with a long central peg about 20 to 30 cm long, on which they sit so 
as to facilitate their working position. This stool if suitable for the type of work, stating that one generally 
lays the porphyry on a sand stratum, is however unsuitable to be used for 
working on a floor that has a substantially rigid plane, because of the already 
precarious equilibrium that the single central shank provides, while being 
suitably adjusted as on contrary happens for use on sandy bottoms due to its 
sand-penetration. This stool with its single shank, however presents the drawback of  
 
being extract and repenetrated in the sand-earth every time the operator 
moves to a different position, therefore it certainly cannot be considered 
suitable or advantageous for use on rigid pavements as substantially found 
indoors. 
Some operators eventually sit on the floor during their work, but in this case, 
the operator self : 
is forced to raise himself every time he wants to move; ruins his trousers unless he uses a cushion that will result in the 
deterioration of and also implicates the major work of his continuous 
movement.  
A further important factor of lost of productivity derives from the fact that 
the operator often needs equipment for laying and work that he must place on 
the floor, equipment that obstacles the movement and causes loss of time due 
to the continuous search and movement of them. 
Chair like stool for floor work, in particular for ground garden working are well known.

part of Claim 1 originate, discloses a wheeled stool, having a rotating 
encased seat mounted by a free rotational vertical axis on a wheeled-legs
