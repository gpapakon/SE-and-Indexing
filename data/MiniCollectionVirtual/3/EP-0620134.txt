<ABSTRACT>
Glazing (34) intended to be adhesively bonded in an opening (38), in particular a motor vehicle glazing intended for adhesive bonding in a bodywork opening, is equipped at its periphery with a frame made of elastomer (35) obtained by high-pressure moulding and/or by extrusion. The frame has a U-shaped section whose inner part of the wings (40, 41) is equipped with lengthwise ribs. The adhesive for fitting (42), which is deposited inside the U does not adhere to its surface but, after curing, ensures a purely mechanical bonding. The part of the section comprising the U-shaped section is made of a thermoplastic polyolefin elastomer based on isotactic polypropylene and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber. The adhesive itself is based on one-component polyurethane polymerised by moisture.

<CLAIMS>
Pane for mounting by gluing onto the surrounding sheet 
of a window opening, in particular automobile pane, 

comprising a frame-shaped profile at its periphery, 
which profile possesses a U-section facing towards the 

sheeting of the window opening and is constituted of a 
polymer, the profile possessing two flanges provided, 

towards the interior of the U, with ribs serving for 
gripping the positioning adhesive cord which hardens in 

place in the U-shaped channel during the positioning of 
the pane and the bonding of the adhesive to the window 

opening, the profile and the adhesive not exhibiting any 
bond to one another so that the connection between the 

profile and the hardened adhesive is purely of a 
mechanical nature due to the shape, characterized in 

that the frame-shaped profile is at least partly, in the 
zone with a U-shaped section, based upon a thermoplastic 

polyolefin elastomer made of an isotactic polypropylene 
and an ethylene-propylene-diene rubber, and in that the 

positioning adhesive is based upon a single-component 
polyurethane system polymerizing with humidity. 
Pane according to claim 1, characterized in that the 

interior of the U-section of the frame-shaped profile 
has the shape of a Christmas tree. 
Pane according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the internal surface of the U of the frame-shaped 

profile which comes into contact with the positioning 
adhesive is provided, at least partly, with a film that 

contains humidity and/or hydroxyl ions. 
Pane according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
film that contains humidity and/or hydroxyl ions is  

 
constituted of a carbohydrate of high molecular weight 

and/or a polyvinyl alcohol. 
Pane according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
film that contains humidity and/or hydroxyl ions is 

based upon methyl cellulose. 
Pane according to one of claims 3 to 5, characterized in 
that the film that contains humidity and/or hydroxyl 

ions comprises, in addition, a hydrophilic or 
hygroscopic salt. 
Method of making a pane according to one of claims 3 to 
6, characterized in that the frame-shaped profile which 

has a U-section is deposited on the pane and in that, 
immediately after this deposition while the profile is 

still hot, the solution making possible the production 
of the film that contains humidity and/or hydroxyl ions 

is deposited.
