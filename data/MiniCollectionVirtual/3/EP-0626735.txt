<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tester device for a battery, the device
forming an integral part of the label encasing the battery.Batteries are generally stored for various periods of time before being put
into use. The batteries may be stored in shops, for example, by the seller and
frequently when purchased they are again stored by the buyer before being used.
On occasion, batteries stored for a long period before being used will lose some
of their charge. In view of this, therefore, it is desirable to have some means for
testing the battery before use in order to determine if the battery has sufficient
charge to operate the desired device.Battery testers have been developed and are available. Initially, the
testers developed were separate from the battery itself, but these testers could be
used to measure the strength remaining in the battery. More recently battery
testers that are either included in the battery package or assembled in the label
secured to the battery have been developed. Testers of this type are generally
used to indicate the capacity remaining in the battery.U.S. Patent No. 4,702,564 discloses a device for testing a battery,
particularly a small, portable battery, which device comprises a flexible,
transparent substrate on which is deposited a narrow band of a black light
absorbing material. A conductive material, which may taper outwardly in
opposite directions from a central point to a pair of outer terminals, is then
deposited on top of the substrate on the same side of the substrate as the
absorber layer or on the opposite side of the substrate to the absorber layer. A
layer of a cholesteric liquid crystal material is then deposited on the substrate
either on the opposite side from the black absorber layer or over the absorber
layer. The conductive material used in the device of this patent is an epoxy
cement-based conductor, preferably silver, printed or painted directly on the
substrate. An indicator scale is located along sections of the conductive
material. To test a dry cell battery, the terminal ends of the conductive material 
are placed in contact with the battery terminals, causing a current to flow which,
in turn, heats the conductive material. The heat generated is most intense at the
central point and radiates outwardly. The heat is transferred through the thin
substrate to the liquid crystal layer which results in a colour change in the liquid
crystal. The traverse of the colour change along the length of the indicator scale,
outwardly from the centre point, is

A testing device for a battery having first and second terminals, the
device comprising: a non-conductive film (2) having two openings (4, 6) being

so arranged that the first and second terminals of the battery are exposed
therethrough; a conductive circuit layer (10) disposed on the non-conductive

film (2), the circuit layer (10) covering the two openings (4, 6) in order to be
able to contact the terminals of the battery therethrough; and a thermally

sensitive material (16) disposed in responsive contact with the conductive circuit
layer (10) such that, heat produced by the flow of current through the conductive

circuit layer (10) on contact of the conductive circuit layer (10) with both of the
terminals results in an indication by the thermally sensitive material (16) of the
