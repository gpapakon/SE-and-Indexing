<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of dispersions stabilised by means of protective colloids using polyvinyl acetals containing sulphonate groups as protective colloid during preparation of the dispersions, optionally in combination with additional emulsifiers or further protective colloids. The dispersions have a pH-dependent viscosity and are suitable for the coating and bonding of substrates, as rheology modifiers and as binders (vehicles) for solid paints.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing dispersions stabilized with
protective colloid using sulfonato-containing

polyvinyl acetals as the protective colloid in the
preparation of the dispersions, if desired in combination

with additional emulsifiers or further protective

by weight relative to the monomers used and these
emulsifiers are anionic or nonionic emulsifiers.
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the protective colloids which can be

additionally used in combination with the
sulfonato-containing polyvinyl acetals are used in

amounts of up to 5% by weight relative to the
monomers used.

linear or branched alkyl chains, cycloaliphatic or

aromatic radicals which, if desired, may have been
additionally modified with hydroxyl groups, halogen

atoms or epoxy groups.
