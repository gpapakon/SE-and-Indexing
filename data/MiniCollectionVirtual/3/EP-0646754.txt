<ABSTRACT>
An improved vapor compression refrigeration system (10) that has 
an indicator (30) for 

detecting the presence of acid contamination in the refrigerant 
contained in the system (10). The 

indicator (30) is permanently or semipermanently installed so that 
continuous monitoring of the 

refrigerant for acid is possible. The indicator (30) is located in a 
portion of the system where the 

refrigerant is always in a gaseous state. In a preferred embodiment, 
the indicator is located in 

a bypass line between the suction (23) and the discharge (22) 
of the system compressor (11). The indicator (30) 

preferably shows the presence of acid by a color change, visible 
from a point external to the indicator (30), in an indicator bed (31) 

in the indicator. The color change may be either permanent or 
the indicator bed (30) may return to its original color when the acid 

contamination is no longer present in the refrigerant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to closed loop vapor compression 
refrigeration systems. In particular, the invention relates to such a system that has an installed 
indicator to show the presence of acid contamination in the refrigerant contained in the 
system. Vapor compression refrigeration systems are used both to cool and heat enclosed 
spaces. Typical examples of such systems are refrigerators and air conditioning, including heat 
pump, systems. The refrigerant in a vapor compression refrigeration system may contain acid 
contaminants. When a refrigerant is subjected to excessive temperatures, such as in an 
overheating compressor, it may decompose chemically. Commonly, one or more types of acid 
are found among the decomposition products, regardless of the type of refrigerant. The 
decomposition products of oil, varnish, insulation, gaskets and adhesives may also include 
acids. Not only can acids damage system components, their presence in the refrigerant can 
indicate component failure or imminent failure. To assure efficient system operation as well as to detect and prevent damage, it is 
desirable to have a capability to determine the presence of acid contamination and, if present, 
remove the acid from the system. U.S. Patent 4,923,806, issued 8 May 1990 to Klowdowski, describes and claims an 
invention having the same assignee as the present invention. The '806 patent describes a 
refrigerant testing apparatus that includes a testing tube that is capable of detecting the 
presence and concentration of inorganic acid as well as water vapor in a stream of refrigerant 
vapor passing through the tube. The '806 testing apparatus also includes a testing tube holder 
having provisions to place the testing tube in flow communication with the refrigerant in a 
refrigeration system. The testing apparatus, marketed by the assignee as the TOTALTEST® 
refrigerant testing system, has enjoyed wide acceptance and commercial success. Another patent, U.S. Patent 5,071,768, issued 10 December 1991 to Klowdowski 
describes and claims an invention having the same assignee as the present invention. The '768 
patent describes another refrigerant testing tube having a different configuration than the '806  
 
tube and that is not only capable of detecting the presence and concentration of both water 
vapor and inorganic acid in a refrigerant vapor stream but also can detect the presence of 
other refrigerant contaminants as well. Both of the patents cited above describe apparatus that are separate from a 
refrige

<CLAIMS>
An improved vapor compression refrigeration system (10, 10') of the type in which 
a compressor (11), having a suction (23) and a discharge (22), circulates refrigerant through a 

closed loop and in which there is a portion of said closed loop where, during operation, said 
refrigerant is in a gaseous state, the improvement comprising: 

   an indicator (30, 30') for detecting the presence of acid contamination in said refrigerant 
located in a bypass line between said suction and said discharge. 
The refrigeration system of claim 1 in which said indicator contains an indicating 
bed (31) that changes color if there is acid present in said refrigerant. 
The refrigeration system of claim 1 in which said indicator has means (37) for 
viewing said indicating bed from a point external to said indicator. 
The refrigeration system of claim 3 in which said indicator has a casing (34) and 
said viewing means comprises a transparent wall portion in said casing. 
The refrigeration system of claim 2 in which the change in color of said indicator 
bed occurs only when there is acid present in the refrigerant passing through said indicator bed 

and the color of said indicator bed returns to its original color when there no longer acid 
present in the refrigerant. 
The refrigeration system of claim 5 in which said indicator bed comprises metacresol 
purple blue in a glycerol film deposited on a silica sand base. 
The refrigeration system of claim 2 in which the color to which said indicator bed 
changes in the presence of acid is permanent and remains even if there is no longer acid 

present in the refrigerant. 
The refrigeration system of claim 7 in which said indicator bed comprises 
bromophenol blue sodium salt in a glycerol file deposited on a silica sand base. 
The refrigeration system of claim 1 in which said indicator further comprises an 
indicator bed that is in downstream refrigerant flow relationship with a flow restrictor (52). 
The refrigeration system of claim 12 in which said indicator further comprises a 
filter (41) that is in upstream refrigerant flow relationship with said flow restrictor.
