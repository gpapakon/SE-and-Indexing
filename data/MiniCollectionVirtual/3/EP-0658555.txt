<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pyridazinone 
derivatives or pharmacologically acceptable salts 
thereof which exhibit an inhibitory activity against 
platelet aggregation and are thus useful for the 
treatment of circulatory disorders such as cerebral 
infarction or myocardial infarction. In recent years, thrombosis has been considered 
to be a major cause for circulatory disorders such as 
cerebral infarction or myocardial infarction. For the 
prevention and treatment of such disorders, a treatment 
has been widely spread in the clinical field, using 
plate aggregation inhibitors which lower the function of 
platelet. However, the history is relatively new and it 
has been expected to develop excellent drugs of this 
category. It is shown in Japanese Patent Application 
KOKAI (Laid-Open) Nos. 63-301870and 2-256668, 
EP-A-0275997 and 0376079, and 
US-A-4,978,665 and 5,011,839 that pyridazinone 
derivatives show a strongly antagonistic activity 
against SRS-A (slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis).  
 
However, these prior publications are silent on a 
platelet aggregation inhibiting activity. Compounds 
shown in JP-A-5-112454 
and International Patent Application KOKAI No. 
WO91/16314 are already known as platelet aggregation 
inhibitors. Under the circumstances, the present inventors 
have synthesized novel pyridazinone derivatives and made 
extensive investigations on their pharmacological activity. 
As a result, it has been found that pyridazinone 
derivatives represented by general formula (I): 
 
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group 
; each of X1 and X2 independently represents a 
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 
to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms, a cyano group, a nitro group or a group shown  
 
by - CO-NR2R3 (wherein each of R2 and R3 independently 
represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms); Y 
represents a halogen atom; Z represents an alkoxy group 
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; ℓ represents 0 or an integer 
of 1 to 3; A represents CH or N; m represents 0 or an 
integer of 1 or 2; and n represents an integer of 1 to 
8, and the pyridazinone derivatives as defined in claim 4 
exhibit an excellent platelet aggregation inhibiting 
action. The present invention has thus been accomplished. A first aspect of the present invention is 
thus to provide the pyridazinone derivatives of general 
formula (I) and the pyridazinone derivatives as defined in 
claim 4. A second aspect of the present invention is to 
provide
