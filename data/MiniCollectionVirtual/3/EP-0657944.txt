<ABSTRACT>
A gate controlled lateral bipolar junction transistor (GCLBJT) device for 
an integrated circuit and a method of fabrication thereof are provided. 

The GCLBJT resembles a merged field effect transistor and lateral 
bipolar transistor, i.e. a lateral bipolar transistor having base, emitter 

and collector terminals and a fourth terminal for controlling a gate 
electrode overlying an active base region. The device is operable as 

an electronically configurable lateral transistor. Advantageously a 
heavily doped buried layer provides a base electrode having a base 

contact which surrounds and encloses the collector. The surface 
region between emitter and collector is characterised by lightly doped 

regions adjacent and contiguous with the heavily doped emitter and 
collector, which effectively reduce the base width of the bipolar 

transistor and improve operation for analogue applications. A 
threshold adjust implant in the surface of the base region under the 

gate electrode allows for control of threshold voltage of the surface 
MOS channel. Performance parameters of the bipolar transistor may 

be adjusted via a signal to the fourth i.e., gate, terminal, to control 
inversion under the gate, thereby controlling the path of carriers 

between the emitter and collector. Transistor performance 
characteristics such as common-emitter current gain, unity-gain 

frequency, and the low frequency noise properties are all variable 
quantities which can be specified electronically, i.e. they are 

programmable by a signal applied to the gate. Concurrent use of field 
effect and bipolar injection phenomenon within the same device yield 

the salient device characteristics. Applications include mixer and 
modulation circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device for an integrated 
circuit and to a method of fabrication therefor. In designing integrated circuits using known technologies, circuit 
designers have access to limited set of transistors. That is, the design 
parameter space avail-able is defined by the choice of field effect 
transistors (FETs) and bipolar transistors offered by the technology. In VLSI and ULSI technology using silicon semi-conductor substrates, 
complementary metal oxide semi-conductor (CMOS) transistors, or 
MOSFETs are typically used. The integration of CMOS transistors with 
bipolar transistors to provide Bipolar-CMOS (BiCMOS) VLSI integrated 
circuits is now well established. BiCMOS circuits provide advantages 
such as high speed, high drive, mixed voltage performance with 
analogue-digital capabilities, which are beneficial in applications such 
as telecommunications. However, there is considerable challenge in 
optimising the performance of both CMOS and bipolar devices 
fabricated with progressively reduced dimensions. In order to fabricate 
an integrated circuit combining both bipolar transistors and field effect 
transistors on the same chip, compromises must be made during both 
design and fabrication to optimise performance of both bipolar and 
field effect transistors, without inordinately increasing the number of 
processing steps. The design stage is critical to the device characteristics both in defining 
both the physical structure of the device and the integrated circuit 
layout. Device parameters for both bipolar transistors and FETs, are 
primarily set during design, i.e. by the device structure, including critical  
 
dimensions, e.g. base width of a bipolar transistors, and 
correspondingly, a channel length of a FET. The latter dimensions 
influence characteristics such as base transport time, base resistance, 
and parasitic capacitances, resistances, etc. Furthermore a design 
must accommodate acceptable variances in fabrication processes and 
materials to obtain a manufacturable process with high yield. Several device structures are known which combine elements of both 
bipolar and field effect type devices in a single device, and seek to 
provide improved characteristics relative to individual FET and bipolar 
devices. For example, Pao in U.S. Patent 4,344,081 discloses a 
combined DMOS FET and vertical bipolar transistor. The device 
comprises a bipolar transistor structure with a gate electrode to provide 
a bipolar device having a much lower ON resistance
