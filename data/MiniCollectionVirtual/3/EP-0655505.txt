<ABSTRACT>
A process for lysing Mycobacteria to liberate 
nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA comprises heating the 

Mycobacteria in an aqueous solution to lyse the 
Mycobacteria and release the nucleic acids, with the 

aqueous solution containing a chelating agent such as 
EDTA or EGTA in an amount effective to inhibit 

degradation of the released nucleic acids. Examples of 
Mycobacteria which can be lysed include 
Mycobacterium 
fortuitum
 and 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
. After lysis, 
the nucleic acid is preferably then amplified and 

detected. Kits useful for carrying out the present 
invention are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of lysing
mycobacteria with heat, and methods of detecting
mycobacteria employing the same.Mycobacteria are a large, diverse, and widely
distributed family of aerobic, nonsporulating, nonmotile
bacilli that have a high cell-wall lipid content and a slow
growth rate. Some mycobacteria are harmless, while others
such as M. tuberculosis are significant pathogens.
Mycobacterial species are differentiated by their growth
rate, pigment production, animal virulence, and biochemical
reactivity.Many detection methods for determining the
presence of pathogenic Mycobacteriaceae rely on the lysis
of the organisms and amplification of nucleic acids
therein. MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PROBES, vol.5, no.5,

1, January 1993, pages 61-65, include examples wherein
Mycobacteria are lysed by heating in an aqueous solution
which comprises EDTA.EP-A-0 547 789 describes a one-step process for
lysing Mycobacteria which comprises exposing the bacteria
to an effective amount of heat.Currently available lysis procedures
are expensive, laborious, time consuming and may require
caustic reagents, specialized equipment, or both. This
contrasts with lysis protocols for other types of cells,
which generally do not require as stringent conditions for
lysis. A first aspect of the present invention is a
process for lysing Mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium
fortuitum and M. tuberculosis to liberate nucleic acid
therefrom. The process comprises heating the
Mycobacteria in an aqueous solution for a time and to a
temperature effective to lyse the Mycobacteria, with
nucleic acids being liberated or released from the
Mycobacteria upon lysis. The aqueous solution contains
the chelating agent (e.g., EDTA, EGTA) in an amount of less than
about 10 mM, said amount being effective to inhibit degradation of
the nucleic acids
released from the Mycobacteria upon lysis thereof. The process for
lysing Mycobacteria may be followed by amplifying and/or
detecting the nucleic acid released.A particular embodiment of the foregoing method
comprises combining a biological sample suspected of
containing Mycobacteria with an aqueous solution
containing the chelating agent EGTA to form a lysis solution,
then heating the lysis solution for a time and to a
temperature effective to lyse Mycobacteria present
therein.
