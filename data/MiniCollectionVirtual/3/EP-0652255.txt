<ABSTRACT>
A curable organopolysiloxane composition is disclosed, 
comprising (A) 100 parts by weight of an organopolysiloxane 

having at least two monovalent aliphatic unsaturated 
hydrocarbon groups bonded to the silicon atoms per molecule, 

(B) an organopolyhydrogensiloxane having at least three 
hydrogen atoms bonded to the silicon atoms per molecule in such 

an amount that the number of the hydrogen atoms bonded to the 
silicon atoms falls within a range of from 0.25 to 8 per 

monovalent aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbon group in component 
(A), (C) a catalyst selected from the group consisting of 

platinum and platinum compounds in an amount of from 0.1 to 
500 ppm in terms of metallic platinum based on the weight of 

the component (A), and (D) from 1 to 650 parts by weight of an 
oil-absorbing filler which has been prepared by impregnating 

(a) a porous filler with from 1% by weight based on the porous 
filler up to a saturation amount of (b) a volatile organic 

compound which is incompatible or partly compatible with 
component (A) and compatible with an organic oily substance. 

The composition exhibits satisfactory adhesion to a substrate 
in such adhesion operation as an FIPG system without requiring 

wiping of organic oily contaminants on the substrate, such as 
hydrocarbon oils, e.g., a rust preventing oil and an engine 

oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an organopolysiloxane 
composition and more particularly a curable organopolysiloxane 
composition containing an oil-absorbing filler having been 
subjected to a specific treatment and thereby exhibiting good 
adhesion to a substrate with its surface contaminated with 
organic oily substances, such as hydrocarbon oils including a 
rust preventing oil and an engine oil, and therefore 
particularly useful as a sealing compound for forming a gasket 
in place. As the demand for heat resistance of materials to be 
used in automobile engines increases, gaskets made of silicone 
rubber have been broadly used for sealing of an engine and its 
surroundings. In particular, formed-in-place gaskets 
(hereinafter referred to as "FIPG") made from a curable liquid 
silicone rubber have been replacing conventional cut-to-size 
gaskets for ease of inventory control of gaskets, ease of 
process control in production of engines, and high reliability 
of sealing performance. The advantages of the FIPG system in 
workability, heat resistance, and the like are now highly 
estimated. Since the engine parts to be sealed are often 
contaminated with organic oily substances such as hydrocarbon  
 
oils, animal or vegetable oils, and synthetic oils as in the 
case that a rust preventing oil is applied or that the parts 
are dipped in an engine oil for smooth assembly, the oily 
contaminants must be wiped off the surface with a cloth, etc. 
before FIPG sealing. However, since the organic oily 
substances, such as hydrocarbon oils, are not completely 
removed, the parts cannot be sealed completely. For example, 
should an oil pan with its surface contaminated be sealed by an 
FIPG system, cases are sometimes met with in which such a 
troubles as leakage of an engine oil occurs in use. Further, 
while an FIPG sealing compound is automatically coated by means 
of a robot, the above-described wiping operation with a cloth 
is manually conducted, which has been a bar to automation of a 
series of operations. In order to settle these problems, WO 88/500178 
(unexamined published international patent application) 
discloses an adhesive comprising a room temperature-curable 
organopolysiloxane composition and an oxime(alkoxy)silylalkylurea 
compound as a fixing agent. Further, JP-A-5-98160 
(unexamined published Japanese patent application) discloses an 
adhesive composition for adhesion to an oil-contaminated 
surface which comprises the same condensation reaction type 
organopolysiloxane composition as used in
