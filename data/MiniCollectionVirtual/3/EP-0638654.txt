<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns bronze-based sintered 
contact components for use as slide components such as 

clutches and brakes and is intended to provide a sintered 
component comprising hard particles admixed with, and 

finely and uniformly distributed in, a Cu-Sn alloy matrix 
to provide improved friction coefficient, and in which the 

dispersed hard particles are inhibited from coming off the 
Cu-Sn alloy matrix during contact movement so that the 

sintered component is possessed of good friction contact 
characteristics and improved mechanical properties. A 

sintered contact component comprises Sn, an iron-based 
intermetallic compound as a hard particle ingredient and a 

solid lubricating ingredient, which have been passed 
through the process of mechanical alloying, mechanical 

grinding or pelletizing, the Sn, iron-based intermetallic 
compound, and solid lubricating ingredient being uniformly 

dispersed in a Cu matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bronze-based
sintered contact component and a method of making the same.
The component is applicable for use in the art of contact
components, such as friction devices of clutches and brakes
for use under dry conditions or clutches for use under wet
conditions incorporated in automatic transmissions, because
it has exceptional resistance to wear and fusion, can
stably retain a comparatively high coefficient of friction,
is very unlikely to attack counterpart material, and
further has high strength, high toughness, and high
hardness.Recently, for use as materials for friction
clutches and brakes to be used under dry conditions,
bronze-based sintered alloys have been developed which can
replace asbestos-based friction materials. For example,
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 58-126948
describes a "dry sintered friction material" which
comprises a bronze-based sintered alloy and hard
particulate matter added thereto to provide higher 
coefficient of friction.However, such sintered material has no reaction
layer between the hard particulate matter dispersed in the
alloy and the matrix, but involves gaps therebetween. As
such, during friction contact under high-speed, high-load
contact conditions, hard particles may come off the matrix,
and this makes it impracticable to expect any high friction
coefficient to be stably exhibited. Another problem is
that fusion may occur relative to counterpart material
starting from the point at which such particle fall-off has
occurred. Further, the sintered material involves
problems, such as bite of come-off particles and attack
against counterpart material. Additionally, in the aspect
of mechanical characteristics, the sintered material as an
abrasion material involves the problem that aforesaid gaps
will deteriorate the mechanical characteristics of the
material, such as strength, toughness and hardness.
Another problem is that the dispersed hard particles are
diametrically large-sized on the order of 30 to 80 µm,
which fact, as a source of fracture, will induce
deterioration in strength and toughness.The present inventors succeeded in uniformly
dispersing various kinds of hard particles in a Cu-Sn based
alloy powder or mixed powder as a matrix by mechanically
alloying the former with the latter. As a result, they 
filed a Japanese patent application on a sintered friction
material having both friction contact characteristics and
mechanical characteristics under dry conditions, serially
numbered as Japanese Patent Application
