<ABSTRACT>
A recording apparatus (DR) for recording digital 
data (Sa and Sv) comprised of a plurality of recording blocks 

(Br) on a recording medium includes a grouping circuit (5) 
which makes a group of the digital data (Sa and Sv) according 

to a predetermined time-based interval (St). A sequence 
number generator (6) divides the group into "N" sequences. "N" 

is an integer. A data block generator (4) divides the input 
data (Sa and Sv) in each sequence into a plurality of data 

blocks (Db). A sequence number generator (5) generates a 
sequence number (Ss) for each data blocks (Db) associated with 

each recording blocks (Br). An ID block generator (23 and 24) 
generates an ID information of each data block (Br) based on 

the sequence number (Ss). A recording block generator (8 and 
9) generates the recording block (Br) based on the ID 

information and the data block (Db; Sa and Sv).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital signal
recording apparatus and, more particularity, to a digital
signal recording apparatus for recording digital audio and
video signals.Consumer-use digital Video Cassette Recorders for
recording audio aid video signals as digital signals are now
commercially available. The consumer digital Video Cassette
Recorder (VCR) market, however, has been constrained by the
various methods applying video compression (band width
compression) technologies to the video signal that have been
proposed as a means for reducing cassette size. EP-A-0 460 764 discloses a digital signal recording apparatus for recording digital
data in data blocks on a recording medium. This known apparatus comprises, for
a normal recording mode wherein data are recorded from an original data input
means, a data block generating means for forming data blocks from the original
data, a sequence number generating means for generating a sequence number and
an ID block generating means for inserting the sequence number in the ID block
and adding the ID block to each data block.A corresponding recording medium provided as a magnetic tape is disclosed in DE-A-41
17 059. In Fig. 5A, an example of the on-tape positioning
of the video signals and audio signals recorded by a digital
VCR is shown. The audio and video signals for one frame are
recorded to ten tracks Tr0 to Tr9 on tape. It is to be noted
that the audio and video signals are recorded to specific and
different segments Sa and Sv of each track.As shown in Fig. 5B, each track Tr further comprises
a plurality of recording blocks Br (Fig. 6) in the audio and
video signal segments Sa and Sv. Each audio signal segment
Sa is comprised of a predetermined number of audio data 
recording blocks Ba and parity recording blocks Bp.
Similarly, each video segment Sv is comprised of a
predetermined number of video data recording blocks Bv and
parity recording blocks Bp.The audio data recording block Ba, the video data
recording block Bv, and the parity recording block Bp has
principally the same construction of the recording block Br,
as best shown in Fig. 6. The audio or video signals are
divided into a plurality of small data blocks Db which is
recorded in one recording block Br. Each data block Db is
complemented by a synchronization signal Ds for bit
synchronization, ID information indicating the location of the
recording data block in the frame, and parity data Dp for
error correction. In parity recording blocks Bp, only parity
data is recorded in its data

for a normal recording mode wherein data are recorded from an original data input
means (1, 2), a data block generating means (4) for forming data blocks (db) from

said original data, a sequence number generating means (6) for generating a
sequence number (Ss), and an ID block generating means (23, 24) for inserting

said sequence number (Ss) in said ID block and adding said ID block to each data
block (Db);

characterized in that

associated ID blocks including corresponding sequence numbers are recorded from

a reproduced data input means (11), a data block extracting means (12a) is
provided for extracting data blocks (Db') from the reproduced data, a sequence

number extracting means (12b) is provided for extracting a sequence number (Ss')

in Claim 1, wherein said sequence number (Ss) is one frame of a television

signal. 
A digital signal recording apparatus (DR) as claimed
in Claim 2, wherein said sequence number (Ss) is determined as to be

synchronized to the color frame cycle of a composite
television signal.
