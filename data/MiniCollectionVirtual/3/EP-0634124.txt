A mattress comprising a core formed from a foam material
and/or latex, said core comprising air passages (8,9) and

seven zones (1-7) of different hardness which different
degrees of hardness are defined by a differnt number and/or

by different diameters of said air passages (8,9) in
each zone, whereby each zone (1-7) extends over the full

width of the mattres, 
characterized in that
 - when the
overall length is 200 cm - the length of a head zone (1) is

about 19 cm, of a neck zone (2) is about 16 cm, of a
shoulder zone (3) is about 25 cm, of a hip zone (4) is

about 15 cm, of a pelvis zone (5) is about 34 cm, of a
thigh zone (6) is about 41 cm, and of a lower leg/foot zone

(7) is about 50 cm, whereby each of said neck and pelvis
zones (2,5) has the second highest degree of hardness and

each of said head and lower leg/foot zones (1,7) has the
second lowest degree of hardness.
A mattress according to claim 1, wherein said air passages
(8,9) are oriented vertical and/or horizontal.
A mattress according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said shoulder
zone (3) has the lowest degree of hardness.
A mattress according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said hip
zone (4) has the highest degree of hardness.
A mattress according to one of the claims 2 to 4, wherein
the diameter of the vertical passages (8) is between 7 and

18 mm.
A mattress according to claim 5, wherein the space between
said vertical passages (8) is between 25 mm and 32 mm. 
A mattress according to one of the claims 2 to 4, wherein
the diameter of the horizontal passages (9) is between

15 mm and 30 mm.
A mattress according to claim 7, wherein the space between
the horizontal passages (9) is between 9,5 cm and 16 cm.
A mattress according to claim 7 or 8, wherein said horizontal
passages (9) are arranged in a common horizontal plane.
