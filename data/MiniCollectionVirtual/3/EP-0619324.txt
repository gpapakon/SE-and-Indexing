<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
combination of recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibody
technologies for developing novel biologics and, more
particularly, for example, to the production of non-immunogenic
(in humans) immunoglobulins specific for the
GPIIb/IIIa antigen and their uses invitro and invivo.Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death
and disability in developed countries. Atherosclerosis, or
narrowing and hardening of the arteries, is a major
contributor to cardiovascular disease. Arterial thrombosis,
the formation of a blood clot or thrombus, commonly occurs in
arteries effected by atherosclerosis, especially when a
rupture occurs in a plaque that has built up on the vessel
wall. The formation of a thrombus in a coronary artery can
cause an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) if the
blockage is sustained, or unstable angina if the blockage is
transient. A thrombus in a cerebral artery can cause a
stroke or a transient ischemic attack. An arterial thrombus
is composed of an aggregate of platelets together with the
protein fibrin.The glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa is found on the surface
of platelets and plays a key role in their aggregation and 
hence the formation of thrombi (see, generally, Phillips et
al., Blood, 71, 831 (1988), which is incorporated herein by
reference). The GPIIb/IIIa complex is composed of one
molecule of GPIIb (M.W. = 140 kDa), which itself consists of
a large (M.W. = 125 kDa) chain and a small (M.W. = 25 kDa)
chain linked by one or more disulfide bonds and one molecule
of GPIIIa (M.W. = 105 kDa), which is a single polypeptide
chain. Ca2+ ions are required to maintain the heterodimeric
structure of GPIIb/IIIa, which is a member of the integrin
family of adhesion molecules. When platelets are activated
by a physiological agonist such as thrombin, adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) or epinephrine, the structure or
environment of the GPIIb/IIIa molecules on the surface of the
platelets is altered so they can bind the serum protein
fibrinogen. The fibrinogen cross-links the platelets so they
form aggregates. GPIIb/IIIa is also a receptor for the
adhesive proteins fibronectin, von Willebrand factor and
vitronectin, and therefore contributes to the adhesion and
spreading of platelets on the subendothelium of injured blood
vessels.A number of monoclonal antibodies have been developed
that bind to GPIIb/IIIa and block its ability to bind
fibrinogen. These antibodies include mouse monoclonal
antibody 10E5 (Coller et al., J. Clin. Invest., 72, 325
(1983)), mouse
