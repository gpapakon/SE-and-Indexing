<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for the separation into phases of a sample of
liquid, including colloidal suspensions, having a
plurality of phases of differing densities, and
especially for the separation of one phase of the liquid
sample from the remainder of the liquid in a manner that
minimizes contamination of the phases and contamination
of a phase of the liquid with the liquid per se. The
invention is particularly useful in the separation of
blood into components thereof, especially for purposes of
testing and analysis of blood components, while
minimizing contamination of a separated phase by the
whole blood.Diagnostic tests frequently require separation of a
patient's whole blood sample into components, especially
cellular portions from non-cellular portions e.g. serum
or plasma from cells. For instance, plasma is obtained
from anticoagulated blood and still contains all of the
coagulation proteins, whereas serum is obtained from
clotted blood with the proteins being retained with the
clot and red blood cells. Samples of whole blood are
typically collected by venipuncture through a special
cannula or needle attached to a syringe or an evacuated
collection tube. The sample of blood in the form that is
to be separated into components is typically drawn, using
a needle, through a penetrable self-sealing elastomeric
closure or other stopper into an evacuated tube.
Separation is then accomplished e.g. by rotation of the
tube in a conventional centrifuge e.g. a swinging bucket
or a fixed angle centrifuge, as the different components
of the whole blood have different densities, as described
in US-A-4 152 269. An apparatus and method of separating blood phases
by rotation of a tube about its longitudinal axis i.e.
axial rotation are described in US-A-4 828 716 (EP-A-285
076). The blood sample is introduced to the tube through
a cap assembly that consists of a piercable closure and a
separator that has a one-way valve. The tube is then
rotated about its longitudinal axis; the heavier cellular
phase lines the tube wall and thereby separates from the
lighter non-cellular (plasma or serum) phase.In Figure 3 of that document there is a telescoping
tube assembly with the separator being in one end of the
inner of the tubes, so that it is movement of that tube
that moves the separator down the outer tube once
separation has been achieved.The axially-located non-cellular phase passes
through the separator. An optical sensor is utilized to
detect when the cellular phase begins passing into the
separato

<CLAIMS>
A method of partitioning a pre-selected phase
of a sample of liquid having a plurality of phases of

differing densities, comprising the steps of:

(a) passing said sample of liquid through a first end of
a tube (10, 30) and into a first chamber (20, 35) of said

tube, said first chamber (20, 35) being located at the
first end (31) of said tube and being separated from a

second chamber (21) located at a second opposed end (32)
of the tube by a separation device (19, 36), said second

chamber being free of the liquid, said separation device
being slidable in relation to the tube and having a flow-restriction

orifice therein to permit fluid flow
communication between the first and second chambers under

the influence of force;
(b) ordering the phases of the sample within the tube
using axial centrifugation; and
(c) while the phases are ordered, reducing the volume of
the first chamber (20, 35) by applying force to the

separation device to cause movement of the separation
device (19) within the tube, such that one phase of the

liquid in the first chamber flows through the flow
restriction orifice as the volume of the first chamber is

reduced and into the second chamber (21), said phase in
the second chamber being removable therefrom through the

second end of the tube,

   characterized in that

(d) the tube (10, 30) is a linear unitary tube having
both of said ends;
(e) the separation device (19, 36) slidably engages the
inner wall of the tube in a fluid tight manner;
(f) passing a probe through the second end of the tube
to apply force to the separation device (19, 36) to cause 

its said movement; and
(g) withdrawing the probe from the tube while
maintaining axial centrifugation.
A method according to claim 1 in which the
second chamber (21) when the sample is introduced into

the tube is an incipient chamber.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2
wherein the probe is introduced through an end plug

(39) at the second end (32).
A method according to any one of the preceding
claims in which the flow-restriction orifice permits flow

of liquid from the first chamber to the second chamber
during step (c) but restricts flow of liquid at other

times.
A method according to claim 4 in which the
flow-restriction orifice is a single continuous channel.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4
in which the flow-restriction orifice is a channel which

substantially encircles the longitudinal axis of the
tube.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6
in which the flow-restriction orifice subtends at least

180 degrees around the axis.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 7
in which the flow-restriction orifice subtends at least

270 degrees around the axis.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8
in which serum or plasma is separated.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8
in which the sample of liquid has at least two phases of

differing density and optical characteristics.
