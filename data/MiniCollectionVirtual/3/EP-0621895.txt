<ABSTRACT>
The discovery of a new form of 12-lipoxygenase RNA and protein in human adrenal, mononuclear, vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells is disclosed. Activation of this 12-LO pathway mediates angiotensin II and glucose induced vascular and renal actions. A rationale for the development of pharmaceutical or molecular methods to inhibit this newly discovered lipoxygenase pathway is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INHIBITION OF THE FORMATION OR ACTIVITY OF HUMAN LEUKOCYTE 12-LIPOXYGENASE PATHWAYThis application is a continuation of United States application, Serial No. 07/936,660, filed 28 August 1992.This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DK 39721 ROl awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.FIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to a new form of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) RNA and protein in human adrenal, vascular smooth muscle, endothelial and mononuclear cells. The invention also relates to the mediation of angiotensin II (All) and glucose induced vascular and renal actions by activation of this 12-LO pathway.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONEnhanced atherosclerotic cardiovascular and renal disease continue to be major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes ellitus and hypertension. All activity and elevated glucose are known to play a role in increased propensity to these disorders.Applicant has found that All can increase the activity of a 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) pathway of arachidonic acid. The 12-LO pathway can produce active products including 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetra- enoic acid (12-HPETE) and more stable 12 hydroxyeico- satetraenoic acid (12-HETE) . In addition, some 12-LO enzymes can also metabolize linoleic acid to produce additional active lipids called hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODES) .The LO products may play a key role in the development of vascular and renal disease. 12-HETE and 12-HPETE have been shown to be important 

mediators of All induced effects on inhibition of renin release from kidney (1) stimulation of aldosterone synthesis from rat and human adrenal cells (2,3) and increase in blood pressure in rats (4) . Furthermore, 12-HETE and 12-HPETE can lead to vascular smooth muscle cell migration at concentrations as low as 10-14M (5) , and both products can inhibit the synthesis of the vasoprotective eicosanoid prostacyclin (6,7) . The linoleic acid metabolities including 13 and 9 HODE have been recently found to be capable of producing mitogenic effects in certain cell types including the liver and fibroblasts (8,9) and can mediate epidermal growth factor induced proliferative actions (9) . Recent studies in several species have shown the presence of two forms of 12-LO (10,11). One type has been cloned from porcine leukocytes (10) , which shares 85% sequence homology to a human tracheal 15-LO enzyme (12) . Another type of 12-LO found almost exclusively in human platelets is only 65%

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS :
1. Isolated and purified 12-LO expressed by human vascular smooth muscle cells or human adrenal cells or mononuclear cells or endothelial cells, said isolated and purified 12-LO being distinct from that found in human platelets and distinct from human 15-LO.
2. A method for treating human vascular disease which comprises inhibiting the expression of the human 12-LO as defined by claim 1 to mediate angiotensin II and glucose induced vascular and renal actions.
3. A method as defined by claim 2 in which said mediation is accomplished by administration of a 12-LO inhibitorâ€”e.g. , baicalein.
4. Isolated and purified human 12-LO RNA from human vascular smooth muscle cells or adrenal cells or mononuclear cells or endothelial cells, said isolated and purified 12-LO being distinct from that found in human platelets.
5. Human leukocyte 12-LO.
6. An isolated purified or substantially purified nucleotide sequence which consists essentially of SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
7. A method which comprises regulating the protein and RNA expression of the human 12-LO defined by claim 1 by culturing said cells iji vitro in a medium in which the concentration of angiotensin II is controlled.
8. A method as defined by claim 7 in which the concentration of angiotensin II is increased to upregulate expression of 12-LO protein and RNA or decreased to down regulate expression of 12-LO protein and RNA.
9. A method for mediating angiotensin II and glucose induced vascular and renal action by controlled activation of the expression of 12-LO 


expressed by human vascular smooth muscle or adrenal or endothelial or mononuclear cells.
10. A method as defined by claim 9 in which said activation is controlled by regulating the level of ambient glucose concentration bathing said cells.
