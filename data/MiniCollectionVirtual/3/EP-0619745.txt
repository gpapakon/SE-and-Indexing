<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bi-directional cannula according 
to the preamble of Claim 1. Such a cannula is known from 
US-A-4 114 618. In patients experiencing cardiopulmonary 
failure, a need exists to perfuse blood 
systemically. A femoral arterial cannula is 
typically used to infuse oxygenated blood into the 
body at the groin. To supply an adequate amount of 
oxygenated blood, the outer diameter of the cannula 
often occludes the inner diameter of the blood 
vessel as oxygenated blood is delivered through the 
lumen within the cannula. Blood exits the cannula 
from an opening at the distal end which typically 
directs blood toward the heart of the patient. For 
patients undergoing long-term cardiopulmonary 
assistance, the problem of ischemia in the lower 
extremity arises since the cannula blocks blood flow 
to the lower leg. A need exists to supply adequate 
blood flow to the lower leg tissues. Prior attempts to obviate ischemia caused by 
arterial cannula occlusion have been awkward and 
inadequate. For example, the insertion of an 
arterial cannula in the aorta to avoid blockage has 
been suggested. Admittedly, the large diameter of 
the aorta permits the insertion of a large cannula  
 
without resulting in distal occlusion. However, 
such abdominal or thoracic surgery is invasive and 
more dangerous than the insertion of a cannula in a 
femoral artery. These dangers limit invasive 
techniques to only the most critically ill patients. A second cannula can also be used to deliver 
blood to the lower leg when the femoral artery has 
been occluded by the systemic cannula. For example, 
a Y connector and tube could be inserted proximal to 
the occluding cannula and the distal end of the tube 
fitted with a catheter which is inserted into the 
femoral artery distal to the cannula. This also 
requires extra hardware and another cannulation. A longstanding need exists for a bidirectional 
femoral arterial cannula which will deliver blood in 
both directions to maintain an adequate flow to the 
heart as well as in the direction of the lower 
extremity. The femoral arterial cannula of the 
invention achieves this bidirectional flow by means 
of a small diverting hole in the side of the 
cannula. The bi-directional cannula of the invention comprises a first 
tube including a proximal end, a distal tip with an 
opening, a side hole in the tube, at least one barb on the 
tube exterior for positioning the side hole 
away from the wall of the blood vessel, 
the bi-directional cannula being characterized by
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A bi-directional cannula comprising a first tube (112) 
including: 


(i) a proximal end (111); 
(ii) a distal tip (110) with an opening; 
(iii) a side hole (38) in the tube; 
(iv) at least one barb (36) on the tube exterior for 
positioning the side hole (38) away from the wall 

of the blood vessel;
 
   characterized by:
 
a diverter (43) in the inside of the tube 

adjacent to the side hole (38), said side hole being, 
thus, a diverting side hole (38) for diverting fluid 

flow such that fluid flowing in the first tube 
(112) exits the distal tip opening (110) in a 

first direction and exits the diverting side hole 
(38) in a second direction opposite of the first 

direction. 
A cannula according to Claim 1, wherein the first tube 
(112) is radiopaque. 
A cannula according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the 
first tube (112) further comprises a first barb (36) and 

a second barb (36) which are positioned adjacent the 
diverting side hole (38). 
A cannula according to Claim 3, wherein the diverting 
side hole (38) is positioned in the depression (43) in 

the first tube (112) exterior between the first and 
second barbs (36). 
A cannula according to any one of the preceding claims, 
further comprising a hub assembly (115) connected to the 

proximal end (111) of the first tube (112), said hub 
assembly (115) including a transparent flexible hub  

 
region (114, 116 and 22) such that when the diverting 

side hole (38) enters the blood vessel, blood flows into 
the hub region (114, 116
, 22) and provides a visual 
indication of the proper placement of the diverting side 

hole (38). 
A cannula according to Claim 5, further comprising a 
dilator assembly (30) which is positioned inside of the 

first tube (112), including: 

(i) a second tube (31) having a distal end (28) with 
a first diameter which occludes the first tube 

distal tip opening (110) and a proximal end (47) 
with a second diameter which is less than the 

first diameter, and 
(ii) a dilator hub (32 and 34) which is connected to 
the hub assembly (115) and the proximal end of 

the second tube (31) such that a hollow passage 
is formed between the first tube (112) and second 

tube (31) which allows blood entering the 
diverting side hole (38) to flow into the hub 

assembly (115). 
A cannula according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the barb (36) further comprises: 


a) a distal facing portion (39) with a 
shallow slope which facilitates insertion 

of the cannula into a blood vessel; and 
b) a proximal facing portion (41) with a 
steep slope which may abut the inner wall 

of the blood vessel and prevent 
inadvertent extraction of the diverting 

side hole (38) outside of the vessel.
