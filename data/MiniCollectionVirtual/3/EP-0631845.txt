<ABSTRACT>
An aerosol cleaning apparatus for cleaning a substrate (220) 
includes an aerosol producing means (100) having a nozzle head. 

The nozzle head is positioned at a selected proximity and 
orientation to the substrate (220) which is held by a rotatable 

holder. The aerosol spray dislodges particles from the 
substrate (220) and the rotation of the substrate (220) further assists 

in the removal of the loosened particles. A method of 
aerosol cleaning includes rotating a substrate (220) at a 

preselected speed and spraying an aerosol jet in 
conjunction with the rotation to help in the removal of 

particles from the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of cleaning of 
substrates and in particular in the area of aerosol jet 
cleaning usable in the manufacture of microelectronic 
components and assemblies. Removal of unwanted foreign materials, process 
residues, particles, and the like (hereinafter be referred 
to as contaminant particles or CPs) from the surface of 
substrates is extremely important for yield and reliability 
of components in the manufacture of microelectronic 
products. The term substrate as used herein includes 
semiconductor wafers, ceramic substrates, printed circuit 
boards, display panels, displays, disks and other 
assemblies. Contaminant particles in microelectronics 
manufacturing has been recognized as originating from 
ambient including tools, operators and processes which are 
used in the manufacturing process. In spite of the use of 
manufacturing rcoms equipped with filters (HEPA filters) 
and blowers to remove airborne particles, use of clean room 
garments and processes using clean chemicals and equipment 
designed for low particulate generation, it has heretofore 
not been possible to eliminate the build up of a certain 
amount cf CPs on substrates during processing, handling and 
storage. It is therefore a general practice to clean the 
substrates at certain process intervals to reduce the 
amount of CPs. Wet cleaning is most widely used, and 
employs de-ionized water or an alcohol (IPA- iso propyl 
alcohol) for rinsing/ spraying the substrates multiple 
times to dislodge (overcome adhesion) the particles. A 
first step in the removal of CPs is to overcome their  
 
adhesion to the surface of a substrate. The adhesion of CPs to the substrate can vary 
depending on the CP size and the nature of the the adhesion 
forces involved, i.e whether the force is chemical or 
physical in origin ( M.B. Ranade, in Aerosol Science and 
Technology, 7, (1987) p161-176). Chemical forces involve 
interaction / exchange of valence or core electrons between 
the CP and the substrate. Physical adhesion forces, most 
common in the adhesion of CPs to substrates in 
microelectronics, are usually of either van der Wall type 
exchange or electrostatic forces. These forces can be 
substantial, and their strength can be several times that 
of gravitational forces. When the adhesion forces are 
predominantly electrostatic in nature, selected chemical 
solutions are often used to neutralize surface charges and 
thus diminish the electrostatic adhesion. Chemically bound 
CPs have higher adhesion energies,
