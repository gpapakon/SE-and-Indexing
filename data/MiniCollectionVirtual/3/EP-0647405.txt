<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
positioning a rolled-up end (S) of a fusiform croissant 

dough piece (1) at a predetermined location of the dough 
piece when it is being conveyed by a conveyor (3). The 

rolled-up end (S) is sensed by a sensor (64) while the 
dough piece (1) is rotated on the conveyor (3) by means 

of an engaging device (6). Since the end is positioned 
at a predetermined location of the dough piece, for 

example at the underside of it, croissants of a uniform 
shape can be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for adjusting or
determining the position of a rolled-up end of a croissant dough piece, so that
the dough piece is conveyed with the rolled-up end always at a certain position.So far as the inventors of the present invention are aware, no such
apparatus or method has previously been proposed.Previously, a croissant dough piece has been produced by
randomly rolling up the dough sheet to obtain a fusiform dough body.
In that croissant producing method, the position of the rolled-up end
of the croissant dough piece is not determined. Thus the resultant
croissants take on irregular appearances. This is a problem that must
be resolved when they are mass-produced, to produce products of a
uniform shape. FR-A-1,110,420 discloses such a dough rolling device.It is the object of the present invention to provide a method and
apparatus for positioning, at a predetermined position, the outer rolled-up end
of a croissant dough piece based on novel means that have not been developed
in the conventional art, to thereby obtain products of a uniform shape.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
method of adjusting the position of the outer rolled-up end of a croissant dough
piece as defined in claim 1.According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided
apparatus for adjusting the position of a rolled-up end of a croissant-dough
piece in a croissant dough-piece bending apparatus, as defined in claim 6. Reference will now be made to the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
Fig. 1 is an overall plan view of a croissant dough-piece
bending machine in which the method embodying the
present invention is used;Fig. 2 is an overall side view of the machine of Fig.
1;Fig. 3 is a front sectional view of the center aligning
apparatus;Fig. 4 is a partial side view of the apparatus of Fig.
3;Fig. 5 is a side view of the rolled-up end sensing
portion of the apparatus; andFig. 6 is another embodiment of the portion of Fig. 5.An embodiment of the present invention will now
be described in connection with a croissant-dough bending
machine. The machine comprises an upstream conveyor 2 to
convey rolled-up croissant dough pieces 1, and a downstream
conveyor 3 located downstream of and below the upstream
conveyor 2.A pair of concave rollers 4, 4' are located adjacent
the upstream conveyor 2, and between the upstream conveyor
2 and the downstream conveyor 3. The concave rollers 4, 4'
are positioned side by side with their axes positioned
horizo

<CLAIMS>
A method of adjusting the position of a rolled-up end of a croissant-dough
piece in a croissant dough-piece bending apparatus, comprising the steps

of conveying a rolled-up croissant dough piece (1) by a conveyor (3), adjusting
the rolled-up end (S) by engaging an engaging device (6, 14) provided on the

conveyor (3) with the dough piece to roll the dough piece, sensing the rolled-up
end (S) of the dough piece (1) by a sensor (64) while the dough piece is being

rolled, the sensor (64) being adapted to provide signals, and disengaging the
engaging device (6, 14) from the dough piece based on a signal from the

sensor (64).
A method according to claim 1, wherein the engaging device includes
a pair of rollers (6) that converge towards each other in the downstream

direction of the conveyor (3).
A method according to claim 1, wherein the engaging device includes
an engaging plate (14) that is configured, when it is positioned to engage a

dough piece (1), so as to hug or closely cooperate with the dough piece.
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, which includes raising the
engaging device (6, 14) out of contact with the dough piece in response to

detection by the sensor (64) of the rolled-up end (S), to release the dough piece
for movement along the conveyor (3).
A method according to any preceding claim, which includes disengaging
the engaging device (6, 14) from the dough piece (1) in response to detection

by the sensor (64) of the rolled-up end (S), after sensing by a further sensor
(63) of a subsequent dough piece approaching the engaging device.
Apparatus for adjusting the position of a rolled-up end of a croissant-dough
piece in a croissant dough-piece bending apparatus, comprising a

conveyor (3) for conveying a rolled-up croissant dough piece (1), adjusting
means for adjus
ting the rolled-up end (S) by engaging and disengaging an 
engaging device (6, 14) provided on the conveyor (3) with and from the dough

piece, a sensor (64) for sensing the rolled-up end (S) of the dough piece (1)
while the dough piece is being rolled, and for providing a corresponding signal

which is operable to disengage the engaging device (6, 14) from the dough
piece.
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the engaging device includes
a pair of rollers (6) that converge towards each other in the downstream

direction of the conveyor (3).
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the engaging device includes
an engaging plate (14) that is configured, when it is positioned to engage a

dough piece (1), so as to hug or closely cooperate with the dough piece.
Apparatus according to claim 6, 7 or 8, including means to raise the
engaging device (6, 14) out of contact with the dough piece in response to

detection by the sensor (64) of the rolled-up end (S), to release the dough piece
for movement along the conveyor (3).
Apparatus according to any of claims 6 to 9, wherein the engaging
device (6, 14) is arranged to be disengaged from the dough piece (1) in

response to detection by the sensor (64) of the rolled-up end (S), after sensing
by a further sensor (63) of a subsequent dough piece approaching the engaging

device.
