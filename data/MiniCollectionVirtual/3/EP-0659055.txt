<ABSTRACT>
A process for determining the glucose concentration in a biological matrix (10) includes at least two detection measurements during which the biological matrix (10) is irradiated with light which acts as a primary light, light propagates in the biological matrix (10) along a light propagation path and the light intensity of secondary light leaving the biological matrix is measured. The process also includes an evaluation step, during which the glucose concentration is derived from the intensity measurement values detected during the measurement steps by means of an evaluation algorithm and a calibrating operation. In order to obtain good test accuracy with simple means, at least one detection measurement is a local resolution measurement of light scattered many times, during which a defined irradiation site (12) of the biological matrix (10) is irradiated with primary light (15), the intensity of the secondary light (17) leaving the biological matrix (10) at a defined detection site (14) is measured and the detection site (14) is positioned with respect to the irradiation site in such a way that the intensity of the light scattered many times at scattering centres in the biological matrix (10) and detected at the detection site is characteristic of the glucose concentration.
