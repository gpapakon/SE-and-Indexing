<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to transmission by packets on a carrier frequency, with spreading-unspreading of the data. So as to reduce the risks of overlap between packets sent by different senders, each packet to be sent (X1-X6, X1'-X6') is designed according to the frequency and/or code spreading characteristics of a common standard packet, consisting of successive segments (X1 to X6, X1' to X6') which are all orthogonal to each other and the first of which includes a header intended for identification. On reception, the header, when it is found, triggers the processing of the corresponding packet with unspreading on the basis of the spreading characteristics of the standard packet as they are known to the sender. Application to packet transmission.
