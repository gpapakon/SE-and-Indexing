<ABSTRACT>
In a device for coupling and uncoupling machine parts (1, 2), for example feed-bar parts, use is made of a clamping set which allows the driving power employed to be significantly lower. In the device, this is achieved by means of clamping elements which first of all lock the parts in place and then clamp them. For this purpose, use is made essentially of a clamping segment (11) which can be latched into a part to be coupled by means of the hook projection (20), after which a wedging piece (14) is moved transversely to the clamping segment (11) and to a pressure piece (13) supported against the housing.

<CLAIMS>
Device for coupling and uncoupling or for locking 
and unlocking removable/exchangeable parts, such as 

tools, gripper rail sections and suchlike machine parts, 
on machine parts fixed to the machine or not to be 

exchanged, in particular for use in presses, having 
coupling areas and a power-operated clamping element 

incorporated in one coupling area, characterized by a 
centrally arranged clamping sleeve (7) in a first machine 

part (1), which clamping sleeve (7) extends in the 
clamping direction and can be shifted into a second 

machine part (2) by means of a servomotor (5), a locking 
bush (8) moved along with the clamping sleeve (7) at 

least over part of the travel of the latter, and one or 
even more clamping segments (11) in the second machine 

part (2), which clamping segments (11) can be displaced 
by the clamping sleeve (7) and during its movement first 

of all from an unlocking position into a locking position 
in operative engagement with the locking bush (8) and by 

one or more wedge pieces (14), which, after the locking 
position is reached, come into operative engagement with 

the clamping sleeve (7) and can be displaced radially by 
the latter and which in the process are supported on the 

one hand on the second machine part (2) or a housing part 
(10) allocated to the latter and on the other hand on the 

clamping segment (11) and displace the latter into the 
locking bush (8) in the direction of the coupling plane 

(28) when the locking position is reached. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the locking bush (8) is secured against rotation and 

has a central aperture (17) in which the clamping sleeve  
 

(7) is mounted in a longitudinally movable manner like a 
splined shaft, and in that the clamping sleeve (7) has an 

encircling peripheral groove (18) and the locking bush 
(8) is provided with at least one spring-mounted dog (19) 

for engaging in the peripheral groove (18), the dog/dogs 
(19) disengaging from the peripheral groove (18) during 

the shifting movement of the clamping sleeve (7) as a 
result of a restraint of movement of the locking bush 

(8). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the locking bush (8) is provided with a collar-like 

shoulder (21) behind which the clamping segments (11) can 
be restrained by projecting hook extensions (20) which 

can be interlocked by radial displacement movement (23) 
after the restraint of movement of the locking bush (8), 

the shoulder (21) and hook extensions (20) being provided 
with interacting wedge surfaces (22) which come into 

operative engagement through the radial displacement 
movement (23). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the clamping sleeve (7) is provided with a wedge 

surface (26) or has a frustoconical extension with which 
wedge pieces (14) can be displaced radially outwards 

(arrow 25), and in that the wedge pieces (14) are supported 
via a wedge surface (24) on wedge surfaces (24) of 

thrust pieces (13) and on wedge surfaces (32) on the 
clamping segments (11), the thrust pieces (13) being 

secured to the second machine part (2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by a 
resetting ring (15) spring-loaded for release and having 

a bearing surface (27) which is constantly in contact 
with a bearing surface (27) on the clamping segments (11) 

and loads the latter for unlocking.
