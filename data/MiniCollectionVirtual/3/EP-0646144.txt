<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyurethane foam prepared in the presence of a foam 
stabilizing additive that comprises a hydrocarbon oil and a polyester polyol which is a solid at 
room temperature. Coating, adhesive and sealing compositions which are to be applied to vertical or 
non-horizontal surfaces desirably have certain limited flow properties. Advantageously, such 
compositions should remain essentially in the area to which they have been applied until they 
have had sufficient time to harden and acquire there final shape. This is especially important 
for compositions which contain one or more liquid components or reactants. Exemplary of 
such are polyurethane sealant foam compositions comprising a liquid polyisocyanate and a 
liquid polyahl component. The polyisocyanate and polyahl should be sufficiently mobile to 
permit their intimate mixing and yet once mixed the reacting mass should not be so mobile 
that it can flow away from the region to which it has just been applied. To this end, a 
thixotropic agent is usually present in the composition. A thixotropic agent is a substance 
which can impart to a composition a liquid state when such composition is shaken or stirred 
and a gel like state to the composition when not physically agitated. Frequently employed thixotropic agents include finely divided particles or solids 
such as fumed silica, polyurethane scrap powder or organic polymers such as polyureas 
obtainable from aliphatic or aromatic polyamines and aliphatic or aromatic polyisocyanates. 
French patent 2,447,955 discloses a multipurpose thixotropic mastic coating composition 
containing volcanic slag, polyurethane scrap powder and a polyester resin. Japanese patent 57-195,765 
discloses thixotropic polyurethane compositions obtainable by mixing an isocyanate-terminated 
prepolymer with an aromatic carboxylic acid ester in the presence of carbon black. 
U.S. Patent 4,438,235 discloses the use of tertiary alkanolamines as thickening additive for 
polyols having a molecular weight of from 100 to 2000. Japanese patent 63-015876 discloses a 
urethane sealant composition which comprises an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer, 
thixotropic fatty acids, filler and plasticizer. U.S. Patent 4,801,623 discloses the preparation of a 
thixotropic agent for storage stable polyurethane systems from a uretedione group-containing 
polyisocyanate with a polyfunctional carboxylic acid and a high molecular weight alcohol.
