<ABSTRACT>
The invention realizes an improvement in the extraction groups for dyes in powder form in automatic weighing plants, each extraction group comprising at least an extraction screw (4), in front of which a dye discharge door (21) is placed, applied to the dye holding hopper (3) and provided with a perforated surface (22) through which the dye in powder form conveyed by the rotation of the screw (4) comes out, said discharge door being closed by a lid (23) connected to the end of a rod (20) which passes inside the hollow shaft (5) of the screw (4). A scraping element (1) which adheres to the perforated surface (22) and which is placed between the discharge door (21) and the lid (23) carries out the fine pulverization of the outcoming dye through the sliding against the perforated surface (22), said sliding being caused by the relative motion between said scraping element (1) and said perforated surface (22) of said discharge door (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns the realization of an improvement in 
the extraction groups for dyes in powder form in automatic 
weighing plants. It is known that the preparation of dye works mixtures for 
obtaining a specific color starting'from the basic colors 
can be realized by means of dosing and weighing plants 
operating in automatic mode. For example, an automatic dosing and weighing plant for the 
preparation of dye works mixtures is known, which is the 
object of the Italian patent n. 1210567 (EP-A2,3-287 708) by the same inventor. 
It consists of a plurality of hoppers containing the 
dyes, placed side by side, each being provided with a dye 
extraction group. Each extraction group consists of an 
extraction screw placed inside the hopper, in front of 
which there is a discharge door provided with a perforated 
surface through which the dye in powder form comes out 
after being conveyed by the screw rotation. The dye which 
flows out of the discharge door is collected in a container 
placed on a scale which automatically stops the screw when 
the preselected weight is reached and then places the 
container under another extraction group which is a part of 
a container with a different dye. A limit presented by this kind of dosing plants is the low 
weighing precision, which in general cannot be better than 
Â±1/10 gram, even if the extraction of the dye from the 
discharge door is obtained by running the extraction screw 
at a low speed. This low precision is due to the fact that when the dye 
comes out of the perforated surface of the discharge door, 
it is not in powdery form, but is clotted in grains of 
different sizes, thus allowing neither a homogeneous dosing 
nor a high weighing precision. Moreover, the realization of  
 
a low extraction speed in order to obtain enough precise 
weighings, namely within the tolerance value of plus or 
minus one tenth of gram, is expensive when large amounts of 
dye are to be weighed, because that causes an increase in 
the preparation time. The purpose of the present invention is to overcome the 
above mentioned disadvantages by realizing an improvement 
in the extraction groups for dyes in powder form in automatic 
weighing plants, the main purpose of which being a 
significantly higher weighing accuracy. Another purpose of the invention is to obtain a high weighing 
precision even with high extraction speeds and thus 
with high screw rotation speeds. The above mentioned purposes are reached by the realization 
of an improvement in the extraction groups for

Extraction group for dyes in 
powder form in an automatic dosing plant, 

comprising: 

at least an extraction screw (4) placed inside a dye 
holding hopper (3), externally wrapping a hollow shaft (5) 

protruding from one side of the hopper (3) and provided at 
the protruding end with a clutch (6) to be connected to a 

rotation group of the screw (4); 
a dye discharge door (21) placed in the front part of the 
screw (4) and applied to the dye holding hopper (3), provided 

with a perforated surface (22) through which the dye in 
powder form comes out, after being conveyed by the rotation 

of the screw (4); 
a lid (23) for closing the discharge door (21), placed in 
front of the perforated s
urface (22) of the discharge door 
(21) itself and connected with the end of a rod (20) passing 

inside the hollow shaft (5) of the screw (4) from which 
it coaxially protrudes in correspondence of the clutch (6) 

of said hollow shaft (5), 
 
characterized in that a scraping element (1) is 

disposed adherently to the perforated surface (22) of the 
discharge door (21) and placed between said perforated surface 

(22) and the lid (23), whereby said scraping element (1) 
realizes the fine pulverization of the dye coming out of 

the door by sliding against the perforated surface (22) of 
the door, said sliding being caused by the relative motion 

between said scraping element (1) and said perforated 
surface (22) of said discharge door (21). 
Group according to claim 1), characterized 
in that the scraping element (1) is sliding keyed, by means 

of a coupling joint (60), to the rod (20), which is coaxial 
to the hollow shaft (5), and which is made to rotate by the 

rotation of said rod (20) through the interposition of said  
 

coupling joint (60). 
Group according to the claim 2), characterized 
in that the coupling joint (60) is composed of a 

clutch (63) provided with an axial hole (69) in which the 
rod (20) is connected, and of an end pin (62) through which 

said joint (60) is made integral inside the hollow shaft 
(5) of the screw (4) by means of the interposition of a 

bearing (66), said clutch (63) presenting a hollow (67) in 
its middle part, which involves a portion of the axial hole 

(69), the bottom surface of said hollow (67) being a plane 
(65) which contrasts against a pin (64) fixed radially 

passing in the rod (20), said pin (64) transmitting the 
rotation of said rod (20) to the clutch (63) by contrast 

against the plane (65) of the coupling (63) itself. 
Group according to claim 3), characterized 
in that the scraping element (1) consists of a couple of 

wings (50) lined-up with one another and radially fixed to 
the periphery of a disc (51), said disc (51) being fixed by 

means of screws (52) coaxial to a flange (61), which in 
turn is fixed to the pin (62) of the coupling joint (60).
