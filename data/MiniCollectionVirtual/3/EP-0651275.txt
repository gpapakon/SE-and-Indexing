<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical scanning
system which forms an optical image on an object and scans
the object by sweeping the optical image over the object.There is known a laser printer including an optical
scanning system wherein an image-forming lens is provided
with a non-reflective coating for preventing a ghost beam
from being reflected therefrom and thereby preventing a
ghost image from being formed on an object by the ghost
beam reflected by a mirror surface of a polygon mirror.In addition, U.S. Patents Nos. 5,191,463; 4,745,416 and
4,586,892 disclose ways of reducing the formation of a ghost
image on an image surface.In the above-mentioned conventional optical scanning
system, since the non-reflective coating must be provided
on the image-forming lens to prevent the ghost image from
being formed, more steps are needed for producing the lens.
In addition, the ghost-image preventing techniques
disclosed by the abovementioned patents suffer from
problems which are explained in detail below.U.S. Patent No. 4,586,782 discloses an optical
scanning system in which the optical axis of an image-forming
lens is inclined with respect to a deflection plane
defined by a light beam incident on a polygon mirror and
the light beam deflected toward the lens by the polygon 
mirror. The centre line of the mirror surfaces of the polygon
mirror parallel to the top and bottom edge lines of the mirror
surfaces is aligned with, and is contained by, the deflection
plane. However, the width or thickness, W, of the mirror
surfaces of the polygon mirror cannot be reduced below about
3mm because, if their width W is smaller than 3mm, the mirror
surfaces cannot be formed with satisfactory accuracy and
accordingly the amount of distortion of an optical image formed
on an object becomes excessive. Therefore, the angle of
inclination of the optical axis of the image-forming lens
cannot be reduced below a certain lower limit, and similarly
the amount of distortion of the optical image cannot be reduced
below a certain lower limit.JP-A-62,237,419 discloses an optical scanning system for a
laser printer comprisingk a polyhedral mirror acting as a light
deflector having a plurality of reflecting surfaces for
deflecting a light beam in a deflection plane defined by the
light beam incident on the mirror and the light beam deflected
by the mirror; and a light converging device comprising a first
lens and a second, cylindrical lens and which receives said 
light beam deflected by said mirror and forms an optical
image.
