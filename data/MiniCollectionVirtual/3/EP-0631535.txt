<ABSTRACT>
An articulated arm transfer device (10) employs a rhomboidal link structure defined by two separated pairs of forearms (12, 13, 14, 15) pivotally joined at the elbows and at the wrists. Each wrist supports a holding means (25, 25') and the elbows are driven in mirror-image semicircular paths by a pair of upper arms (17, 18) which are superimposed alternately under each pair of forearms as the upper arms are rotated about mutually adjacent shoulder joints. The motion is such that at any time one holding means (25, 25') is moving rapidly between an extended position and a park position while the other holding means (25, 25') is slowly traveling a negligible distance between a park position and a retracted position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The apparatus of the present invention relates generally to
material transfer devices. The material transferred might
include, but not be limited to, semiconductor wafers, such as
Silicon and Gallium Arsenide, semiconductor packaging substrates,
such as High Density Interconnects, semiconductor manufacturing
process imaging plates, such as masks or reticles, and large area
display panels, such as Active Matrix LCD substrates.The transfer of delicate silicon wafers or the like between
a plurality of work stations or locations in the manufacture of
semiconductor devices presents unique handling problems. The
silicon wafers are very delicate and have highly polished
surfaces. When the wafers are abruptly moved, they tend to
slide. This sliding action can cause the silicon wafers to
abrade or alternatively can cause damage to their edges if they
collide.There are numerous devices described in the prior art for
transferring silicon wafers. For example:U.S. Patent No. 3,823,836 discloses an apparatus which
includes a supply carrier with a plurality of ledges to hold the
silicon wafers and a withdrawal device having a vacuum chuck.
The vacuum chuck is attached to an elevator which raises and
lowers the chuck. A horizontal transfer arm coupled to the
vacuum chuck is used to transfer the silicon wafer from the
supply carrier to a desired work station.U.S. Patent No. 3,730,595 discloses a wafer transfer
handling apparatus having an indexable carrier for transferring
wafers to and from work stations. Wafers enter and leave the
wafer carrier on an air slide with the aid of a wafer ejector
acceptor arm having directional air jets. The wafer ejector 
acceptor arm controls the driving of the wafers into or out of
the carrier from or onto the air slide, which moves the wafers
to or from a work station.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,062,463, 3,874,525 and 4,208,159 also
disclose wafer transfer devices which include either pneumatic
components or gripping devices for handling the wafers.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,666,366 and 4,909,701 disclose wafer
transfer handling apparatus having an articulated arm assembly
which extends and retracts in a "froglike" motion to transfer an
object such as a wafer between a plurality of locations. Two
articulated arms are operatively coupled such that when one arm
is driven by a motor the articulated arms extend and retract in
a "froglike" or "frogkick" type of motion. A platform is coupled
to the arms and has the object to be transferred disposed
thereon.However, the articulated arm assembly of such

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for transferring objects (A, B), the
apparatus including:


two upper arms (17, 18) rotatably connected to a
support (19),
two pairs of forearms (12, 13 and 14, 15), each pair
of forearms being rotatably connected to opposite outer ends

of the two upper arms,
a first object holding means (25) connected to a first
pair of forearms (12, 13),
a second object holding means (25') connected to a
second pair of the forearms (14, 15), and
means (40) for moving the holding means (25, 25') in a
vertical direction.
Apparatus as in Claim 1, further comprising a mechanical
coupling (20, 21) between the two upper arms (17, 18) for

rotating the two upper arms (17, 18) together in opposite
directions of rotation.
Apparatus as in Claim 1, further comprising means
connected to the support (19) for moving the support in a

direction substantially parallel to a first axis of a first
one of the upper arms.
