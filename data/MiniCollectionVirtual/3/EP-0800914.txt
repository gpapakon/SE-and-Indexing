<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated
film, in particular, one which can be torn easily by
hand and which is superior in the moistureproof
property and, thus, is adapted to apply advantageously
for packaging foods, drugs and others, as well as to a
packaging material comprising a layer composed of this
laminated film, especially easily hand-tearable one.Usually, packaging film for use in sealed
packages of food products, drugs and so on are composed
of double- or more multilayers including at least a
heat-sealable layer and an outer coverage layer. The
heat-sealable layer has a role for providing a tight
sealing of the package and is made of, for example,
polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP). The outer
coverage layer should have a heat resistance for
standing against the heat upon the heat sealing and a
shock resistance required for protecting the packaging
(film) and the contents of the package against physical
attack from outside and is in general made of, for
example, polyester, polyamide (Ny), polypropylene (PP)
or cellophane, solely or in combination (composite) of
two or more of them.For the outer layer of the packaging film, a 
film of polyester, polyamide or polypropylene is
emplyed, which is usually biaxially stretched for
further increasing the heat resistance and shock
resistance.In using a cellophane film, so-called "moistureproof
cellophane" in which one or both surfaces are
treated by a moistening-protective coating by, for
example, vinylidene chloride thin film, is often chosen,
since ordinary cellophane has an excessive hygroscopic
nature and its material properties will considerably
change when moistened.It is required for a material for the outer
layer of a packaging sheet to have, in addition to the
superior heat resistance and shock resistance mentioned
above, a moisture-barriering property on storage and
transport thereof so as to block up intrusion of
external moisture into the package to prevent any
moistening of the article to be packaged. An "easy
hand-tearability", namely, a property for opening the
package by tearing the packaging sheet easily by hand
for taking out the packaged article is also an important
feature required for a packaging film.In conventional multilayer packaging films,
however, none has been found to have better resistances
to heat and shock together with a moisture-barriering
property and an easy hand-tearability.Thus, for the laminated films of the stand of
technique in which the outer layer is constituted of
cellophane, there may be enumerated
