<CLAIMS>
A membrane, preferably a suturable membrane for guided tissue
regeneration, biocompatible slow-resorbing, comprising a crosslinked collagen

with a crosslinking agent, characterised in that said membrane comprises either a
collagen crosslinked from a coagulated native collagen after coagulation of a gel

of collagen by a coagulating agent, or is present in the form of a mixed membrane
comprising a sponge of a collagen or atelocollagen-glycosaminoglycan mixture on

which a gel of collagen has been deposited before crosslinking the whole, or
comprising a sponge of a collagen and chondroïtine-4-sulfate mixture which has

been compressed under a pressure of 150 bars.
Membrane according to claim 1, characterized in that it is a native
collagen, particularly of type I or type III.
Membrane according to claim 1, characterized in that it is atelocollagen.
Membrane according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the collagen or
atelocollagen is mixed with a glycosaminoglycan.
Membrane according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the degree of
crosslinking is such as to increase the denaturation temperature of the crosslinked

collagen by at least 15°C, preferably at least 20°C, compared with native collagen.
Membrane according to claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the crosslinking
agent is diphenylphosphorylazide.
Membrane according to claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the mixed
membrane contains a sponge realized from a mixture of native collagen and of a

glycosaminoglycan, in particular chondroitin-4-sulfate, on which has been
deposited a native collagen.
Membrane according to claims 7, characterized in that the sponge is a
compressed sponge, in particular under a pressure of 150 bars, before the gel is

run. 
Membrane according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the
proportion of glycosaminoglycan relative to the collagen or atelocollagen is

comprised between 18 and 25%.
Membrane according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that
glycosaminoglycan is a structural glycosaminoglycan, in particular hyaluronic

acid, chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, dermatan-sulfate, heparan-sulfate,
keratan-sulfate, heparin and its derivatives, in particular heparins with a

low molecular weight of between about 2000 and about 10,000.
Membrane according to any one of the claims 1 to 10, characterized in that
the mixture of collagen or atelocollagen and of glycosaminoglycan is in the form

of an aqueous solution of glycosaminoglycan containing from 0,5 to 4% by weight
of glycosaminoglycan and of an aqueous solution of collagen or atelocollagen

having a concentration of between 0,5 and 2% by weight of collagen or
atelocollagen, which are advantageously brought to a pH close to neutrality and in

particular to a pH of between 6.5 and 8.
Process of manufacture of a mixed membrane, preferably a suturable
membrane for guided tissue regeneration, biocopmatible slow-resorbing,

comprising a crosslinked collagen, characterized in that it is first prepared a
sponge of mixed collagen or atelocollagen-glycosaminglycan, on which is then

run a collagen gel, and the whole is crosslinked with a crosslinking agent, in
particular diphenylphosporylazide.
Process according to claim 12, characterized in that the collagen sponge
comprises a mixture of native collagen and of a glycosaminoglycan, in particular

chondroitin-4-sulfate.
Process of claim 12 or 13, characterized in that a sponge of a collagen and
chondroitin-4-sulfate mixture is prepared, compressed under a pressure of 150

bars, before running the gel of collagen.
Use of crosslinked collagen with a crosslinking agent, for the manufacture
of a membrane, preferably a suturable membrane for guided tissue regeneration, 

biocompatible slow-resorbing, characterised in that said membrane comprises
either a collagen crosslinked from a coagulated native collagen after coagulation

of a gel of collagen by a coagulating agent, or is present in the form of a mixed
membrane comprising a sponge of a mixture of collagen or atelocollagen-glycosaminoglycan

on which a collagen gel has been run before crosslinking the
whole, or comprising a sponge of a mixture of collagen and of chondroitin-4-sulfate

which has been compressed under a pressure of 150 bars.
Use according to claim 15, characterized in that said membrane is as
defined in any one of claims 2 to 11.
Use of claim 15 or 16, characterized in that said membrane is used as a
material for guided tissue regeneration in dental surgery, for example for filling

periodontal pockets, raising maxillo-mandibular ridges or for regenerating bone
around an implant.
