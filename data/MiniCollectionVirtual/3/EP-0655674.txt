<ABSTRACT>
Data input apparatus (100) operative to store and 
to transfer written information includes a pen (104) and 

a board (102), which has a sensing mechanism (101), a 
memory device (106) and a communication link (112). When 

the pen (104) imprints symbols to the board (102), the 
symbols are not concurrently electronically displayed. 

But the symbols are detected by the sensing mechanism 
(101), stored in the memory device (106), and can later 

be transferred to an electronic device (150) through the 
communication link (112).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data input
apparatus, for example an electronic board for storing
and transferring information.One constantly has to deal with different types of
forms. For example, a government employee has to fill
out administration forms, an applicant has to fill out
application forms, and a warehouse owner has to fill out
inventory forms. The information in the forms usually
has to be filed or stored in a computer by an operator
for later use. Many people have designed different
devices to streamline such processes.In one prior art design, a user writes directly on
an electronic device with a screen. The written
information is concurrently shown on the screen, and is
also stored in the electronic device. This approach
could be quite expensive due to the cost of the screen.
Moreover, the device with a screen may be quite fragile,
and may not be suitable to be used in a hostile
environment.In another prior art design, a user writes on an
electronic pad with a computer connected to the pad.
The computer shows and stores the written information.
This approach could again be quite expensive.Thus prior methods either require a user to fill
out a form and an operator to input the information into
a storage device, or solve the problems in an expensive
manner with pads and screens. United States Patent No. 5,243,149 teaches a combined
digitiser note pad and scanner that also accepts and records
audio prompts. An original document can be stored in memory
via the scanner, and the stored document can be
electronically annotated with the digitiser pad.Another similar device is disclosed in DE-A-3,113,105.
This teaches a portable device for recognising characters
written on a form which subsequently stores these recognised
characters in a computer memory. The device includes a
pressure sensitive plate that registers the presence, and
traces the movement of, a writing implement such as a pen.
The memory stores the standard characters of that which is
recognised by the device. It does not store an individuals
handwriting.The present invention seeks to provide improved data
input apparatus.According to an aspect of the present invention, there
is provided data input apparatus as specified in claim 1.According to another aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a method of inputting a device into a
device as specified in claim 15. The invention can provide in some embodiments a
low-cost electronic board, which can solve problems of
recording and transferring information even in a hostile
en

<CLAIMS>
Data input apparatus comprising:

a stylus (104) for defining symbols;
a board (102) on which symbols can be formed by means
of stylus, the symbols not being concurrently displayed

electronically;
a stylus locating mechanism (101) coupled to the board
(102) for locating the movement of the stylus when forming

the symbols;
transfer means coupled to the stylus locating mechanism
and to the memory device operable to transfer to the memory

device all symbols and pen strokes detected by the stylus
locating mechanism; and
a memory device (106) coupled to the board (102) for
storing the detected symbols for later transfer.
Data input apparatus as recited in claim 1, comprising
a communication link (112) for transferring the symbols

stored in the memory (106).
Data input apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
the apparatus is operable with a plurality of different

formats of paper or other mechanism, the stylus locating
mechanism being able to locate the formed symbols from each

of said different formats of paper or other mechanisms.
Data input apparatus as recited in claim 1, 2 or 3,
comprising a holding mechanism (114) operative to hold one

or more pieces of paper (200) or other mechanism onto the
board (102).
Data input apparatus as recited in claim 4, comprising
a sensor (116) operative to produce a signal when the holding

mechanism (110) is activated.
Data input apparatus as recited in claim 3, 4 or 5, 
wherein the or each paper or other mechanism is a standard

form (200) with an identifier (202, 204, 206); the apparatus
comprising an identifier mechanism (118,120) for storing the

identifier (202, 204, 206) in the memory device (106).
Data input apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the
identifier mechanism is operable to store different

identifiers for different formats of paper or other
mechanism, each identifier being associated with its

respective detected symbols and pen strokes such that data
related to a plurality of different formats of paper or other

mechanism can be stored in the memory device (106) identified
by its respecti
ve identifier (202 - 206).
Data input apparatus as recited in any preceding claim,
comprising a functionality indicator (142) alerting a user

to check the functionality of the apparatus (100).
Data input apparatus as recited in any preceding claim,
comprising an automatic power activation mechanism (104, 101)

operative to activate the apparatus (100) when the stylus
locating mechanism detects the tip of the stylus (104).
Data input apparatus as recited in any preceding claim,
comprising an activity indicator (146) operative to provide

an indication when symbols are provided on the board (102)
and stored in the memory device (106).
Data input apparatus as recited in any preceding claim,
wherein the communication link (112) is an infrared, radio

frequency or microwave communication port.
Data input apparatus as recited in any preceding claim,
wherein the apparatus includes a visual display and the

identifier mechanism (118,120) is a switch which when
