<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel trisazo dye,
a process for producing the same and an aqueous ink
composition containing the same dye. More
particularly, it relates to a trisazo dye which is superior
in safety to the human body.Heretofore, there have been proposed various polyazo
dyes for writing or ink-jet printing onto materials to be
recorded such as papers, or for dyeing fibers or papers. A
number of polyazo dyes are substantive, so that a dyeing
process using the polyazo dyes is simple, as well as
fastness of the polyazo dyes is comparatively good. The
polyazo dyes having such an advantage are widely used in
the art.However, the polyazo dye has a problem to be solved.
The first problem is chemical properties. Excellent
chemical properties (e.g., stable solubility, stability
with time of dyed density, light-resistance, etc.) are
particularly required for the dye which is used as ink for
writing implements. The second problem is safety. Safety 
of chemical substances is a great concern in recent years,
so that dyes having excellent safety which have no harmful
effect on the human body are required.As the dyes having improved dyeability and fastness,
for example, there have widely been used black trisazo dye
or polyazo dye derived from benzidine or its derivatives
(e.g., C.I. Direct Black 19, C.I. Direct Black 154, C.I.
Direct Black 168, etc.) for the above applications.
However, these dyes are inferior in safety to the human
body because the results of AMES test of the dyes shows
false positive or positive.On the other hand, as the polyazo black dyes having
improved safety to the human body, there have been used a
food pigment (e.g., Food Black 2, etc.), a recording
solution using the same as a recording agent, a 4,4'-diaminodiphenylamine-2-sulfonic
acid based trisazo dye
instead of a benzidine based one, a stilbenic tetrakisazo
dye free of amino group in its molecule. However, an
aqueous ink composition using these dyes provides poor
water resistance and poor light-resistance in the
handwriting and is inferior in dyeability and fastness.A water-soluble dye is usually separated from an
aqueous phase by means such as acid separation, salting-out
and the like. However, since inorganic salts are included
in the course of such separation means, it is difficult to 
obtain a highly pure dye and various problems due to
impurities may be arisen. For example, when a low-purity
dye is used as aqueous ink for writing implements,
continuous replenishing of ink to the penpoint may be
interfered. Also,
