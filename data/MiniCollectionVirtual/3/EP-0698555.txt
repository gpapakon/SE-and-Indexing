<ABSTRACT>
A carton score line breaker for breaking four end 
closure panels of a carton (12) includes, at a breaking 

station at which the carton (12) dwells, two oppositely 
disposed pairs of breaking elements (18,20,30,32) for 

breaking, in turn, the two oppositely disposed pairs of 
panels inwardly. Both pairs of elements (18,20,30,32) are 

continuously rotating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method of and
apparatus for forming an end closure of a rectangular
tubular carton, especially, but not exclusively, for
breaking plastics-coated, four-sided, paperboard carton end
closure panels along score lines formed between the four end
panels and the four side panels of the carton, and, more
particularly, to such apparatus having breaking elements
operative on at least two of the four sides during a dwell
occurring during indexing of the carton.Known carton end closure formers (within which term
we include various apparatus for pre-breaking, folding
and/or tucking of carton bottom closure panels) can be
divided into two groups, namely a first group in which the
cartons dwell at forming stations at which the formers act
upon the panels and a second group in which the cartons
advance while the formers act upon the panels.GB-A-1,001,596; US-A-2,410,587; US-A-4,215,522; US-A
-4,337,059; US-A-4,738,077 and US-A-5,167,607 disclose
formers of the first group and all operating with an
oscillatory motion. Packaging machines including those
formers are suitable only for a relatively low production
rate of cartons.GB-A-1,036,320; US-A-3,166,994; US-A-3,398,659; US-A
-3,943,834; US-A-3,999,469; US-A-4,519,181; US-A-4,589,862
and WO-A-82/03834 disclose formers of the second group. At
least one forming element of each former rotates continually
unidirectionally in GB-A-1,036,320; US-A-3,166,994; US-A
-3,398,659; US-A-4,589,862 and WO-A-82/03834, in each of
which the cartons are received over mandrels arranged in a
ring and serving to carry the cartons past the former while
the forming element(s) act(s) upon the end panels. Although
packaging machines having such continually rotating forming
elements and such a ring of indexing mandrels are suitable
for a relatively high rate of carton production, the
positioning of the former between dwell stations limits the
number of mandrels which can be provided in the ring and thus 
limits the carton production rate of the ring.In GB-A-1,036,320; US-A-3,166,994 and WO-A-82/03834, the
mandrels radiate from an axis in the form of a spider which
indexes round the axis, dwelling at various work stations
which are distributed around the axis and at which the
carton end closure panels are acted upon in various ways.US-A-2272255 discloses a packet-forming machine having
an intermittently rotated spider provided with a plurality of
horizontally disposed mandrels about which blanks of carton-forming
material are wrapped to produce the packet.

A method of forming an end closure of one end of a
rectangular tubular carton (12), comprising mounting said

carton (12) around an indexable mandrel (14) with four end
panels (52-66) extending beyond an end of said mandrel (14),

indexing said mandrel (14) and thus said carton (12) to a
forming station at which said mandrel (14) and thus said

carton (12) dwell, continually rotating unidirectionally
each forming element (18,20) of a first pair of oppositely

disposed forming elements (18,20) at said station to contact
and urge inwardly two dwelling, oppositely disposed, end

panels (52,54) at said one end, and operating a second pair
of oppositely disposed forming elements (30,32) at said

station to contact and urge inwardly another two dwelling,
oppositely disposed, end panels (56,58) at said one end,

characterised in that each forming element (30,32) of said
second pair of oppositely disposed forming elements

(30,32) is continually rotated unidirectionally.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the forming
elements (18,20) of said first pair, while acting upon

said carton (12), continually turn about respective axes
(22,24) substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of

said carton (12), characterized in that the forming elements
(30,32) of said second pair, while acting upon said carton

(12), continually turn about respective axes (26,28)
substantially perpendicular to the first-mentioned

respective axes (22,24) and said longitudinal axis.
A method according to claim 2 and followed by
turning through a right-angle a unit comprised of the pairs

of oppositely disposed forming elements (18,20,30,32).
Apparatus for use in forming an end closure of one end
of a rectangular tubular carton (12), comprising an

indexable mandrel (14) around which said carton is mountable
so that four end panels (52-66) extend beyond an end of said

mandrel (14), driving means for indexing said mandrel (14)
and thus said carton (12), a forming station at which said

mandrel (14) and said carton (12) dwell and which
includes a pair of oppositely disposed forming elements 

(18,20) operable to contact and urge inwardly two dwelling,
oppositely disposed, end panels (52,54) at said one end,

and other driving means (38-50) which serves to rotate each
forming element (18,20) of said pair continually and

unidirectionally, said forming station further comprising
a second pair of oppositely disposed forming elements

(30,32) operable to contact and urge inwardly another two

continually and unidirectionally.
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said
forming elements (18,20) of said first pair are arranged

to rotate about respective axes (22,24) substantially
perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of said mandrel (14)

arranged to rotate about respective axes (26,28)
substantially perpendicular to the first-mentioned

respective axes (22,24) and to said longitudinal axis.
Apparatus according to claim 5, wherein a unit

said drive unit (38) and one (40) of said plurality of

pinion gears (40-50).
Apparatus according to claim 7 as appended to claim
6, wherein said shaft (36) is split, and a coupling (36b)
