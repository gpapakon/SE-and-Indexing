<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a textile double knitwear with two outer knitwear webs (1, 1') and with a spacing structure located between them, which is characterised in that it has a right/right knitting structure, in that the fibre materials for the knitwear webs and for the spacing structure consist of polyester, and in that it contains monofilaments (3) and textured multifilament yarns (4) next to one another as spacer threads. Furthermore, the production and use of this double knitwear are described.

A textile spacer knit having two outer lengths of 
knit web (1, 1') and an in-between spacer structure and 

also a purl structure, characterized in that the fiber 
materials for the lengths of knit web (1, 1') and for the 

spacer structure consist of polyester and in that as 
spacer threads (3, 4, 5) it contains both monofils (3) 

and texturized multifilament yarns (4). 
The textile spacer knit of claim 1, characterized 
in that 30 to 70 % by weight, preferably 40 to 60 % by 

weight, of the spacer threads (3) are monofilaments. 
The textile spacer knit of at least one of claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the monofilaments (3) have 

a linear density of 20 to 150 dtex, preferably of 50 to 
110 dtex. 
The textile spacer knit of at least one of claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the texturized multifilament 

yarns (4) are air or false twist texturized and have 
a yarn linear density of 50 to 350 dtex and a filament 

linear density of 1 to 5 dtex. 
The textile spacer knit of claim 1, characterized 
in that the polyester is polyethylene terephthalate. 
The textile spacer knit of at least one of claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that th
e perpendicular distance 
between the lengths of knit web (1, 1') is 2 to 50 mm, 

preferably 2 to 12 mm. 
The textile spacer knit of at least one of claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that its basis weight is 200 to 

1400 g/m
2
. 
The textile spacer knit of at least one of claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the monofilaments (3) and  

 
the texturized yarns (4) of the spacer structure are 

interlaced side by side in every row. 
The textile spacer structure of at least one of 
claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the monofilaments 

(3) and the texturized yarns (4) of the spacer structure 
alternate. 
A process for producing the spacer knit of claim 
1 by producing, on the two needle bars of a warp-knitting 

machine, a double-length warp knit where the spacer 
threads (3, 4, 5) pass alternatingly forward and backward 

between the two lengths of knit web (1, 1') and are 
interlooped in each web so that each of the webs has a 

purl structure, characterized in that the guide needles 
for the spacer threads are fed with partly monofilaments 

(3), partly texturized multifilament yarns (4) and in 
that all the processed fiber materials consist of 

polyester. 
The process of claim 10, characterized in that 
the laying is effected in such a way that 30 to 70 % by 

weight, preferably 40 to 60 % by weight, of the spacer 
threads are monofilaments (3). 
The process of at least one of claims 10 and 11, 
characterized in that the laying is effected in such a 

way that spacer threads composed of monofilaments (3) and 
texturized multifilaments (4) form rows extending side by 

side in the longitudinal direction. 
The process of at least one of claims 10 to 12, 
characterized in that the laying is effected in such a 

way that spacer threads composed of monofilaments (3) and 
texturized multifilaments (4) alternate viewed in the 

longitudinal direction. 
The process of at least one of claims 10 to 13, 
characterized in that the laying is effected in such a 

way that spacer threads composed of monofilaments (3) and 
texturized multifilaments (4) alternate between the 

chains of loops extending in the longitudinal direction. 
The use of the textile spacer knit of claim 1 for 
padding, upholstering and lining.
