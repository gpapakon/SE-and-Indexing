<ABSTRACT>
A catheter and introducer needle assembly with a compact needle shield is provided. The introducer needle includes an enlarged diameter portion. The needle shield is disposed inside the catheter hub. The needle shield includes a transverse barrier to prevent unwanted distal movement of the needle once the needle has been withdrawn into the needle shield. The needle shield also includes a small diameter proximal opening to limit proximal movement of the needle out of the needle shield.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPACT NEEDLE POINT SHIELDBackground of the InventionThe subject invention relates to a catheter and introducer needle assembly that includes a needle shield that will safely shield the sharp distal tip of the introducer needle after the needle has been used to insert the catheter into a patientCatheters, particularly intravascular (IV) catheters, are used for infusing fluid, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient or withdrawing blood from a patient Peripheral IV catheters tend to be relatively short, and are on the order of about one and one-half inches in length The most common type of IV catheter is an over the needle peripheral IV catheter As its name implies, an over the needle catheter is mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip The catheter and the introducer needle are assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from the patient's skinThe catheter and introducer needle assembly is inserted at a shallow angle through the patient's skin into a peripheral blood vessel, i e a smaller blood vessel that is not connected directly to the heart but is one of the branches of the central blood vessels that is directly connected to the heart In order to verify proper placement of the assembly in the blood vessel, the clinician confirms that there is flashback of blood in the needle and in a flashback chamber located at the proximal end of the needle, which is typically formed as part of the needle hub Once proper placement is confirmed, the clinician applies pressure to the blood vessel by pressing down on the patient's skin over the distal tip of the introducer needle and the catheter This finger pressure occludes further blood flow through the introducer needle The clinician withdraws the introducer needle, leaving the catheter in place, and attaches a fluid handling device to the catheter hub Once the introducer 

needle is withdrawn from the catheter, it is a "blood contaminated sharp" and must be properly handledIn recent years, there has been great concern over the contamination of clinicians with a patient's blood and a recognition that "blood contaminated sharps" must be immediately disposed This concern has arisen because of the advent of currently incurable and fatal diseases, such as Acquired Immunosuppressive Deficiency Syndrome ("AIDS"), which can be transmitted by the exchange of body fluids from an infected

I Claim
1 A catheter and introducer needle assembly, comprising a catheter having a proximal end and distal end, a catheter hub in fluid communication with the catheter and having a proximal end and a distal end connected to the proximal end of the catheter, an introducer needle disposed in the catheter and having a proximal end and a distal end and defining an enlarged diameter portion, and a needle shield having a proximal end and a distal end disposed within the catheter hub with an interference fit, the needle shield defining a mam chamber with the introducer needle extending therethrough wherein the needle shield has a means for engaging the enlarged diameter portion of the introducer needle to prevent unwanted proximal movement of the introducer needle and wherein the needle shield includes a means for engaging the introducer needle to prevent unwanted distal movement of the introducer needle
2 A catheter and introducer needle assembly, comprising a catheter having a proximal end and distal end, a catheter hub in fluid communication with the catheter and having a proximal end and a distal end connected to the proximal end of the catheter, an introducer needle disposed in the catheter and having a proximal end and a distal end and defining an enlarged diameter portion, a needle shield having a proximal end and a distal end disposed within the catheter hub with an interference fit, the needle shield defining a main chamber with the introducer needle extending therethrough wherein the needle shield has a proximal opening that has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the enlarged diameter portion of the introducer needle and wherein the needle shield includes a transverse barrier adjacent to a distal opening in the needle shield, and a telescoping member having a proximal end and a distal end slidably disposed in the needle shield through the proximal opening wherein the

telescoping member has an enlarged diameter portion adjacent to tne distal end and a reduced diameter portion adjacent to the proximal end.
3. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 2 wherein the reduced diameter portion is crimped.
