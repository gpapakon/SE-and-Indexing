<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for, heat treatment, which prevents 
metallic contamination of the object of heat treatment due 

to a metallic manifold, and which reliably maintains a 
hermetic separation state between a moving mechanism 

storage chamber and a reaction chamber even when the 
pressure inside the former is remarkably lower than the 

pressure inside the latter. An exhaust port (7) is disposed 
in the quartz reaction chamber (1) so as to evacuate the 

inside of this chamber (1), and a sealing flange of a double 
structure is formed of a quartz flange (9) and a metallic 

flange (10). When the reaction chamber is under a sealed 
state, the metallic flange (1) is not exposed to the reaction 

chamber (1). Further, the sealing flange and a moving body 
(12) are engaged with each other by springs (3). When 

the sealing flange (10) is placed in the sealing position, 
the springs energized by the moving body press the sealing 

flange against the internal pressure of the reaction chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a load locking thermal 
treatment apparatus comprising a reaction chamber, a heating system 
around said reaction chamber, a transfer system for moving a boat 
supporting workpieces into and out from said reaction chamber and a 
transfer system containing chamber insulating said transfer system from 
the atmosphere, 
a seal flange driven by a mobile section of said transfer 
system and separating the transfer system containing chamber from the 
reaction chamber; said seal flange being a double structure comprising of a 
flange section made of a high purity material such as quartz and the like 
and a flange section made of a metal material, such that the quartz 
flange and the reaction chamber are sealed through a sealant when the 
metal flange is positioned at the limit of its movement. There are several types of vertical heat treatment apparatus in 
the art. JP-A-63-161 612 discloses a vertical heat treatment apparatus in 
which a sealing flange comprising of a metallic plate and a SiC plate 
mounted thereon is lifted directly by an arm member of the transfer system 
for moving a boat supporting wafers in and out of a reation chamber and 
the reaction chamber is sealed by a sealing material provided on the SiC 
plate. US-A-5 048 800 discloses a vertical heat treatment apparatus in 
which a sealing flange of a single structure is lifted directly by a 
shaft of a transfer system and a reaction chamber is hermetically sealed by a sealing 
material provided on the sealing flange. US-A-5,127,365 discloses a vertical heat treatment apparatus in 
which a sealing flange of a single structure is lifted directly by a 
shaft of a transfer system and a reaction chamber is sealed directly by 
the sealing flange.  
 Figs.1a, 1b and Figs.2a, 2b show a conventional 
longitudinal type thermal treatment apparatus and a conventional 
load locking thermal treatment apparatus respectively. A heater 2 is located around a reaction chamber 1 made 
of a high-purity material such as quartz and the like, and an open 
end of the reaction chamber 1 is sealed by a seal flange moved by a 
transfer system(not shown). A mobile section and the seal flange 
moved by the transfer system are connected by a spring member, so 
that it makes the sealing condition between the seal flange and the 
reaction chamber better. Because the pressure inside the reaction 
chamber during a process is about the same as an outer pressure, 
the spring member is required at least such resiliency that the 
spring member
