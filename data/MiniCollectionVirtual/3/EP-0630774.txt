<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to resin panels and more
particularly to resin panels requiring structural
reinforcement to increase resistance to deformation.It is known to make outer panels of a vehicle body from
a resin material by injection molding techniques. Such
outer resin panels often require structural
reinforcement to increase resistance to deformation by
a force applied to an exterior surface of the panel.
For example, an outer resin panel of a vehicle door
assembly requires reinforcement in the upper region of
the panel where the panel is curved toward the top edge
bordering the windowsill. Such reinforcement is
required in order to meet squeeze test specifications
to which the door panels are subjected.In the past, such structural reinforcement to
increase the strength and stiffness of the top region
of the door outer resin panel was provided by bonding
a separate piece to the inner surface of the outer
panel between the front and rear edges thereof to form 
a hollow truss section. This is shown in Figure 1 which illustrates a cross-section
of the upper region of such a door panel wherein a separate piece 2 is
bonded to the inner surface of an outer door panel 4 for creating a truss section
6. As can be seen, this creates a double thickness in the region of the bonds 8.
This has the undesirable result that sink marks occur at the outer surface of the
outer panel that correspond to the bonded surface. The sink marks damage the
quality of appearance of the exterior surface of the outer panel. Moreover, the
bonding of a separate reinforcement part to the outer panel results in higher
manufacturing costs due to the additional expenses required for the tooling
required to make the separate part and for bonding the two parts together.
Furthermore, the overall weight of the outer panel is increased due to the double
wall thickness in the region of the bond.Another construction that has been considered to solve the requirement
for structural reinforcement in the area of the curved upper region of an outer
door resin panel is shown in Figure 2 wherein ribs 10 and 12 are molded as
integral parts to the inner surface of outer door panel 4. While such ribs increase
the stiffness of the panel in its upper curved region, such integrally molded ribs
also create sink marks in the exterior surface opposite the location of the ribs,
damaging the quality of appearance of the exterior surface of the panel.EP-A-0,545,693 and the article in Kunststoffe, Vol. 81, No. 3, March
1991, pages 192-198 each disclose

<CLAIMS>
A structurally reinforced vehicle door panel, comprising:

an injection molded resin outer panel (14) having an exterior surface and
an integrally molded hollow reinforcement truss (42)

extending across said panel in a central region between top and
bottom edges of said panel for increasing resistance to impact deformation while

simultaneously exhibiting an outward bulge in said exterior surface which
constitutes an integrally molded rub strip.
The panel as defined in Claim 1, wherein said truss is formed in a
region of said panel where a character line (50, 52) is intended on an exterior

surface of said panel so that any imperfection in the exterior surface due to
formation of said integrally molded hollow reinforcement truss blends in with

the intended character line.
The panel as defined in Claim 1, further comprising an integrally
molded rib (48) extending inwardly from said integrally molded hollow truss.
