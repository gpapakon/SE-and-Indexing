<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR REGULATINGIL-6 PRODUCTION IN VIVOTechnical fieldThe invention relates to methods and compositions used for the regulation of cytokines in vivo , more specifically, to the reduction of abnormally elevated levels of interleukin 6 by compositions comprised of DHEA congeners.BackgroundInterleukin 6 ("IL-6") is a pleiotropic cytokine that is produced by a variety of cells and acts on a wide range of tissues, exerting growth-inducing, growth-inhibitory and differentiation-inducing effects, depending on the nature of the target cells. It is believed that IL-6 regulates immune responses, acute phase reactions and hematopoiesis, and that it may play a central role in host defense mechanisms.Due to its pleiotropic effects, IL-6 was previously identified as Î²2-interferon (IFN-02) B-cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2) , 26 kDa protein, hybridoma/plasmacytoma growth factor (HPGF or IL-HP1) , hepatocyte stimulating factor (HSF) and monocyte granulocyte inducer type 2 (MGI-2) . However, molecular cloning studies have shown the common identity of the polypeptide chains of all of these factors.IL-6 is believed to be involved in induction of B-cell differentiation, induction of acute phase proteins in liver cells, growth promotion of myeloma/plasmacytoma/hybridoma cells, induction of IL-2 

and IL-2 receptor expression, proliferation and differentiation in T cells, inhibition of cell growth of certain myeloid leukemic cell lines and induction of their differentiation to macrophages, enhancement of IL- 3 induced multi-potential colony cell formation in hematopoietic stem cells and induction of the maturation of megakaryocytes as a thrombopoietic factor, induction of mesangial cell growth, induction of neural differentiation of PC12 cells and induction of keratinocyte growth.Disregulation or overproduction of IL-6 is thought to be linked to a variety of pathologic states, including polyclonal B-cell abnormalities and autoantibody production (for example, cardiac myxoma, rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman's disease, AIDS, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)); proliferative diseases (mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, psoriasis) ; acute infectious neural diseases (viral meningitis, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis meningitis, bacterial meningitis, herpes simplex meningitis) ; and malignancies (plasmacytoma and myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia, and renal cell carcinoma) . Abnormally high levels of IL-6 in serum and in urine has also been observed in individuals after
