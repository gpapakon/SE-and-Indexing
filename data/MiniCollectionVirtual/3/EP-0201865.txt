<ABSTRACT>
In a color cathode ray tube, a panel (3) having a single 
faceplate (3-1) is coupled to a plurality of necks (5-1 to 5-12) 

through a plurality of funnels (4-1 to 4-12), respectively. A 
plurality of electron gun assemblies (6-1 to 6-12) are received 

in necks (5-1 to 5-12) and a plurality of deflection units (7-1 to 
7-12) are mounted around the funnels (4-1 to 4-12), respective­

ly. A screen (2) is formed on an inner surface of faceplate (3-1) 
and has a plurality of continuous segment regions (16-1 to 

16-12) each of which is scanned with the electron beams 
emitted from the corresponding electron gun assembly (6-1 to 

6-12) and deflected by the corresponding deflection unit (7-1 
to 7-12). A shadow-mask (10) is so supported in the panel (3) 

as to face the faceplate (3-1). The electron gun assemblies (6-1 
to 6-12) adjacent each other so arranged as to have a relative 

distance GS between the central axis thereof:
 

GS = m·SG [(n - 1) Ph + d]/Ph

 
where SG is a relative distance on the deflection plane, be­

tween the electron beams emitted from each of said electron 
gun assembly, d is a distance between predetermined effec­

tive apertures of the shadow mask through which the prede­
termined electron beams pass, the predetermined electron 

beams landing on endmost adjacent effective phosphor ele­
ments in each two adjacent ones of said segment regions, and 

m and n are integers, respectively.
