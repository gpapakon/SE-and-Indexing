<ABSTRACT>
To eliminate the "pi-line" artefact after processing a silver 
halide industrial photographic X-ray material is disclosed comprising 

on at least one side of a support, at least one gelatino silver 
halide emulsion layer and a total amount of silver halide, corresponding 

to from 6 to 20 g of silver nitrate per square meter and per 
side, and at least one non-sensitive protective antistress coating, 

wherein said photographic material comprises at least one vinyl 
sulphone compound as a hardening agent and at least one polyoxyalkylene 

compound as a surfactant in at least one of its hydrophilic 
layers. A method of image forming in said silver halide photographic 

material is described wherein after exposure to direct X-rays said 
material is subjected in an automatic processing machine to the 

steps of developing in a developer comprising as a surfactant at 
least one anionic alkylphenoxy and/or alkoxy polyalkyleneoxy phosphate 

ester, sulphate ester, alkyl carboxylic, sulphonic or phosphonic 
acid and/or a salt thereof, fixing in a fixer which may comprise 

at least one alpha-ketocarboxylic acid, rinsing and drying.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic industrial 
X-ray film and a method of forming an image in said industrial X-ray 
film by the processing of said exposed film in automatic processing 
machines. For industrial radiography a normal processing cycle is characterised 
by the following steps: transport of the film through the 
developer at 28°C, transport through the fixer at 26°C, transport 
through a rinsing bath and transport through the drying station. If 
an automatic processing machine is used film transport is made 
possible by the racks each of which is provided with a lot of 
rollers immersed in the different processing baths. Due to the 
normal use of this automatic processing machine the said different 
processing baths become inevitably polluted by e.g. dust being 
carried into the processor by the film to be processed itself. 
Another possibility consists in the generation of very small metallic 
silver particles in the developer, due to the development 
process. Inevitably quite a lot of manipulations like an arrest in 
development, the start of the circulation of processing and regeneration 
liquids make the generated solid particles become deposited 
onto the rollers of the racks. When a film is introduced into the processor as first film of a 
whole series of films, its first contact with the first stained 
roller releases the deposit from the said roller or disturbs the 
deposited layer. As a consequence after one rotation of the said 
roller the unevenly distributed dirt or stain comes into contact 
again with the transported film surface so that it may be deposited 
onto said surface. This phenomenon is recurrently repeated, not only 
at the first roller, but also at the further rollers that are 
mounted onto the racks. The result of this process is that one or more visibly appearing 
disturbing lines may be observed at the surface of the processed 
film. This artefact is called "pi-line" as it is recurrently depicted 
at a distance corresponding to the circumference of the rollers. 
As the processing is further continuing the artefact may disappear.  
 The gravity of the said artefact is strongly dependant on the 
maintenance of the processor and on the silver content of the film. 
Strongly polluted processors may show many "pi-lines" at one or more 
successive film sheets when the said processors are started up. The "pi-line" phenomenon, in some references also called "pie 
line", has already been described in "Radiographic Artefacts" by 
Richard J. Sweeney, Ed.
