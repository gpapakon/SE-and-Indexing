<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for controlling the temperature of 
an object, in particular a semiconductor wafer support 

structure (62) in a wafer processing chamber. A gas gap 
(64) is created between the two adjacent objects (62, 70) 

of different temperatures. The pressure in the gap (64) is 
adjusted to control the thermal conductivity of the gas 

between the two structures. To have a large heat flow 
between the two objects (62, 70) so that their temperatures 

can be closely matched, the pressure is increased. To 
maintain the temperature of the object (62) sought to be 

controlled regardless of the temperature of the adjacent 
item (heat source/sink) the pressure is reduced to a strong 

vacuum (acting as insulation) so that very little heat flow 
occurs through the gas gap (64). Localized control acts 

together with a local heat sink to precisely control the 
temperature of a semiconductor support structure 

pedestal/cathode (62) to maintain the uniformity of the 
temperature of the wafer during processing to prevent wafer 

surface process anomalies due to variations and gradients 
in temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to controlling the
temperature of an object, e.g., a cathode or wafer pedestal in
a silicon wafer processing chamber, by varying the thermal
conductivity of a gas in a narrow gap between the object and a
heat source/sink.When processing silicon wafers, a good product
requires surface uniformity. Achieving surface uniformity,
whether in deposition or removal processes is very much
dependent on and proportional to the silicon wafer temperature
and any thermal gradients that it experiences during
processing operations, such as etching and deposition.
Changes in the temperature of the wafer cause changes in the
rate of activity at the wafer's surface. When a wafer's
temperature varies outside desired process temperature ranges,
the deposition or etching of surface layers can lead to
anomalies in the surface condition and unacceptable roughness.To avoid exceeding process temperature limits and
help maintain temperature uniformity, cooling and/or heating
fluids are often circulated through the process chamber
members adjacent to/or in contact with the wafer being
processed to add or remove energy to help maintain the process
temperature within its limits.In these systems, a change in temperature of an etch
cathode requires that the temperature of all the circulating
liquid in the heat exchanger, fluid lines, and cathode be
changed. While large energy input can dramatically change 
local temperatures, resistance to such changes can be hampered
by the fact that the temperature of all the fluid must change
before the localized temperature increase due to localized
energy input can be overcome. The rate at which the
temperature of the entire system can change is governed by the
rate at which energy can be input/withdrawn from the entire
system by the heater/refrigerator unit.An example of an existing temperature control system
is shown in Figure 1. A thermal reservoir 27 containing a
thermal transfer fluid (often a chemically treated water) is
heated or cooled by a heating/refrigerating unit 28 which is
controlled within process limits by a controller 29 to
maintain the temperature sensed by a temperature sensor 22 at
the discharge of a circulating pump 21. The thermal transfer
fluid is circulated through the wafer processing chambers 25,
26 by means of thermal fluid lines 23. The wafers 30 in the
wafer processing chambers 25, 26 rest on support pedestals
having a cooling fluid 31 passing through them. In one
configuration (which minimizes the cooling fluid flow rate,
pump size, and piping
