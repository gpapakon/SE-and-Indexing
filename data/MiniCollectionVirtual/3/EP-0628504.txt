<ABSTRACT>
A bridge plate (1) slides in its own plane to all sides on eye forming lugs (14), on which it is lockable in position. Each lug can rest at its underside on a plate cross-member (15), to which it is clamped by a bolt (21), whose head bears against it via a washer (19). The hole (17) in the lug for the bolt can be large enough to allow the plate to slide in relation to it. At least one of the clamping components can have protrusions pressing into an adjacent one so as to distort it permanently.

Transfer bridge for platforms, having a bridge 
plate which is pivotable at the platform end about a 

horizontal axis, and an extension member which is disposed 
so as to be retractable and extendable or respectively 

inwardly pivotable and outwardly pivotable on the free end 
of the bridge plate for support on the platform to be 

loaded or unloaded, the bridge plate being provided with 
one or more lugs on its end facing the platform to form a 

pivotal location, the eyelet of said lugs surrounding a 
pin, which forms the horizontal axis and is mounted on the 

platform, characterised in that the bridge plate (1) is 
displaceable in all directions on the lugs (14) in the 

plane determined by the bridge plate (1) and is fixedly 
securable on the lug (14) after displacement. 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the lug (14) lies with its underside on a cross-piece 

member (15) of the bridge plate (1) and is clampable in 
position between said bridge plate and the widened portion 

of a screw bolt (21), which traverses the cross-piece 
member (15) and the lug (14). 
Bridge according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the head of the screw bolt (21) acts on the lug (14) via a 

disc (19). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the lug (14) has such a large-dimensioned aperture (17) for 

the screw bolt (21) that the bridge plate (1) is 
displaceable relative to the lug (14). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
at least one element (14), which participates in clamping, 

is provided with small projection members (25), which  
 

extend into the adjacent element when the screw bolt (21) 
is tightened and permanently deform said adjacent element. 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
an opening (22) is situated in the cover plate (2) of the 

bridge plate (1) above the head of the screw bolt (21), via 
which opening the screw-connection is operable. 
Bridge according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the size of the opening (22) corresponds to that of the 

screw bolt (21) or its head. 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the pin or the pins (6) are retained by sleeves (7), which 

engage in windows (8) of a bridge enclosure (9) surrounding 
the bridge plate (1) and are welded there. 
Bridge according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the lugs (14) are disposed with minimal clearance between 

the cross-piece member (15) and the cover plate of the 
bridge plate (1). 
Bridge according to claims 1, 2, 3 and 9, 
characterised in that the lugs (14) have at their upper 

side an indentation (18), in which the head of the screw 
bolt (21) or the disc (19) is disposed. 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the eyelet of the lugs (14) protrudes into a window (8) of 

a bridge enclosure (9), which surrounds the bridge plate 
(1), and is welded there. 
Bridge according to claim 8, characterised in that 
a pin (6) is associated with each lug (14), and the ends of 

said pin are disposed in the sleeves (7).
