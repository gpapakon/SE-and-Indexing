<ABSTRACT>
An orthopaedic splinting/casting material comprises a high molecular weight polyester in combination with a cellulosic filler, the material is mouldable at a temperature in the range of 55 to 70  C and has a self-adherent characteristic at such temperature, its weight is in the range 0.75 to 4.0 kg/m2, its density in the range 900 to 1200 kg/m3, and its modulus, at ambient temperature, not less than 350 mPa. Preferably the polyester is a polyhexamethylene adipate or a polyepsilon-caprolactone. The cellulosic filler may be one or a combination of ground almond shell, ground olive stones and wood flour. Preferably the polyester is in powder form, in which case the polyester and the filler are both generally of the same or closely similar grain size distribution. If desired a fabric layer, e.g. a lightweight polyester fabric, may be incorporated at or adjacent at least one surface of the polyester/filler material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ORTHOPAEDIC SPLINTING/CASTING MATERIALTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention is concerned with orthopaedic splinting/casting materials.BACKGROUND ARTThere are described in GB-A-1 366 091 various formable orthopaedic cast materials in the form of a bandage, web, film, tape or sheet for use in the treatment of both human and animal bodies, in particular in the case of broken limbs and sprains. In the case of each of the various materials there described it is proposed to use high molecular weight poly-epsilon- caprolactone, either as a component of a blend or as a sole polymeric constituent. Poly-epsilon-caprolactone had the advantage of being easily and rapidly applicable to the affected body part when heated to a moulding temperature, while forming a rigid, non-irritating, strong, durable, water-resistant, close-fitting splint or cast when at temperatures below the softening temperature, which splint or cast was nevertheless easily removable when no longer required without risk of injury or irritation to the patient and indeed without serious damage to the material itself, which could therefore be sterilised and re-used, if desired. Because the splint or cast could be custom-made from sheet or the like, furthermore, it was not necessary to stock different sizes or styles of splint or cast. Moreover, splints or casts made from poly-epsilon-caprolactone are relatively light in weight and do not have the disadvantages of being bulky, as was the case with previously used plaster of Paris, for example. Moreover, the softening 

 temperature of poly-epsilon-caprolactone is in the range 55 to 70°C, which, especially bearing in mind the low thermal conductivity of the material, would not cause discomfort to the patient whose body part is brought into contact with the thus softened material.Problems have, however, been perceived in the use of poly-epsilon-caprolactone and various proposals have been made for modifying it, and in particular for blending it with other polymeric materials, in order to achieve physical characteristics which are considered to be desired: see e.g. US-A-4,144,223, GB-A-2 015 004 and WO 83/02898.It is of course well known that the physical characteristics of a polymer can be significantly varied by the use of fillers, which also of course in general render the cost of the material cheaper. Thus, in GB-A-1 366 091 it is proposed that up to 25% by weight filler can be used. Moreover, the proposed fillers in this case include magnesium or calcium carbonate, finely divided silica, clay, asbestos
