<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve a rotor for electrical machines, especially for machines having a high rotation speed, having a rotor core and having a rotor casing which comprises a binding which supports the rotor core radially and is made of fibre-reinforced plastic, in such a manner that the rotor casing essentially rests on the rotor core over the complete area and with an essentially uniform surface load, it is proposed that the rotor core have an outer envelope surface with a small coning angle, on which the rotor casing is supported with an inner casing surface having the same coning angle, and that the rotor casing have a protective layer between the inner casing surface and the binding.
