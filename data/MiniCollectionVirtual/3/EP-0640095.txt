<ABSTRACT>
A process for the manufacture of vancomycin which does not require preparation of a phosphate intermediate. The process consists of passing a vancomycin broth through a suitable adsorbent, followed by passing the vancomycin through a second adsorbent, producing a purified vancomycin. Purified vancomycin is then crystallized from the solution by adding a base solution that imparts a pH of above about 9.0 to about 9.5 to the purified vancomycin. The crystallized vancomycin is separated from the solution, dissolved in solution and recrystallized by adding a base solution which imparts a pH of above about 9.0 to about 9.5 to the dissolved solution. The recrystallized vancomycin is dissolved and titrated with hydrochloric acid. Vancomycin .HCl is then precipitated from the solution using an organic solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
the manufacture of vancomycin.Vancomycin is used to treat infections of
methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Vancomycin is
produced by cultivating the bacteria S. orientalis in a
nutrient culture media.The vancomycin broth is filtered and added to
a column that contains an adsorption resin that
decolorizes and desalts the vancomycin. The resin is
washed, and the vancomycin eluted with a solvent of low
pH, followed by decolorization with carbon.The vancomycin eluate is then further purified
using a single recrystallization step at low pH. The
crystallized vancomycin is combined with a strong acid
such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), and precipitated in an
organic solvent such as acetone to form vancomycin路HCl.
This process for the manufacture and purification of
vancomycin路HCl is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,067,099
to McCormick et al.In another example of a prior art process for
the manufacture of vancomycin路HCl, a solvent of 0.1%
phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in a solution of 10% isopropyl
alcohol (IPA) is used to elute purified vancomycin from
the adsorption column. The vancomycin eluant is then
concentrated using reverse osmosis or vacuum
evaporation. An aqueous solution that contains
approximately 60 g/l of potassium phosphate (KH2PO4) is
added to the concentrated vancomycin solution. The
KH2PO4 causes the vancomycin to crystallize from the
solution. The resultant slurry is centrifuged to remove
the excess liquid. The vancomycin crystals obtained 
from centrifugation of the slurry are reslurried in
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to a pH of approximately 4.5
followed by treatment with KH2PO4 to a pH of
approximately 2.0. Vancomycin again crystallizes from
the solution. The resulting slurry is centrifuged to
separate the crystals from the liquid. The resultant
solid is dissolved in water and the mixture is eluted in
an ion exchange column to prepare vancomycin
hydrochloride.EP-A- 0323150, to Catt et al. discloses another method to
precipitate vancomycin in a base solution with a pH of
about 7.8 to about 9.0. At pH's above about 9.0, the
base crystallization disclosed in Catt et al. is
unsatisfactory because reduced yields and discolored
products result; pH's of 8.0 to 8.5 are preferred.The present invention is directed to a process
for the manufacture of vancomycin using base crystallization
at a pH above 9.0 to about 9.5. Vancomycin is
concentrated and purified by elution with a solvent in a
column with a suitable adsorbent therein followed by
elution through a second
