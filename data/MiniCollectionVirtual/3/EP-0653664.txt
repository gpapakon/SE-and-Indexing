<ABSTRACT>
In regard to a panel (1) in which a short-circuit 
ring (8) is formed of Al or an Al alloy of a gate wiring line or 

a source wiring line, the present invention is related to a 
method for removing the short-circuit ring after a process 

of inspecting defects of the panel, and provides a method 
for manufacturing a liquid crystal display panel by cutting 

a glass substrate outside the short-circuit ring made of Al, 
and thereafter removing the short-circuit ring by grinding 

the short-circuit ring while spraying on the substrate a 
water having a low resistance including something like 

carbon dioxide gas. 
According to the manufacturing method, since 
the low-resistance material of Al of the gate wiring line 

can be used as the short-circuit ring as it is, the material 
of Al can be commonly used as a current supply wiring line (6) 

in subjecting the material of Al to an anodic oxidation 

process. Therefore, it is not required to form a film of 
any metal other than Al and pattern the same, which can 

simplify or reduce the number of processes. 
Furthermore, since the material of Al is 
trimmed off by grinding, the Al material is not clawed in 

cutting the material of Al, which allows the cutting to be 
achieved without causing any short circuit between adjacent 

wiring lines nor slipping the tooth in scribing a scratch 
marking line by means of a scriber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
separating a short-circuit ring which connects gate wiring
lines or drain wiring lines of an array substrate in a
manufacturing process of forming a liquid crystal display
TFT array substrate into a panel.A liquid crystal display has been regarded as
a very important display device for use in an information
terminal of office automation, and accordingly there has
been a rapid promotion of developing high-definition large-size
liquid crystal display screens on the order of ten
inches. Under the above-mentioned circumstances, there has
been taken a lot of efforts in producing defect-free liquid
crystal display panels employing active elements, in
particular, a thin film transistor (referred to as a TFT
hereinafter).However, since the TFT element is a field-effect
transistor, a defective TFT is possibly produced due 
to electrostatic charges generated in the manufacturing
process. Therefore, sufficient care or consideration is
required.For the above-mentioned reasons, a short-circuit
ring made of a Cr material, a Ta material, or an ITO
material has been formed around the TFT array substrate, and
after filling liquid crystals for the formation of a display
panel, the above-mentioned short-circuit ring has been
removed (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. SHO 63-180935).In a removing process, a scratch marking line
is formed on a glass substrate by means of a scriber or the
like, and thereafter the short-circuit ring has been
separated by cutting.Since the aforementioned Cr material, Ta
material, and ITO material are hard materials, they can be
easily cut off.In more detail, when the gate wiring line or
a source and drain wiring lines are made of a soft material
such as Al, only the material of the short-circuit ring
formed in the peripheral portion is changed into a material
such as Cr so that the short-circuit ring can be easily cut
off. However, in the current situation that large-size
TFT array panels are produced, the gate scanning
electrode is required to have a reduced resistance, and
therefore a material including Al has been increasingly used
as a gate wiring metal.In order to reduce the defect, there has been
put in practice a system for forming an insulating film by
subjecting the gate electrode made of Al, Ta, or the like to
an anodic oxidation process.It is to be noted that only the short-circuit
ring is formed of a material of Cr, Ta, or the like
different from the material of Al.Thus, when the short-circuit ring is formed
of a material
