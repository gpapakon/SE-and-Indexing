<ABSTRACT>
The elastic sealing ring (1) for the sealing between the 
edge of an opening (8) in an outer wall (7) and a part 

(12) of a door (9) penetrating in said opening (8) has a 
ring-shaped body (2) and a fastening flange (4) provided 

on an end thereof protruding outwards as seen from the 
radial direction made of a hard material for the 

fastening onto the outer wall (7) and an elastic, 
deformable lip (3) protruding inwards as seen from this 

radial direction which forms the actual sealing and is 
designed to fit up against the penetrating part (12) of 

the door (9), whereby this lip (3) is made of a 
thermoplastic elastomer with rubber-like qualities, which 

forms a whole with the hard material of the fastening 
flange (4) as a result of injection moulding onto or 

together with the hard material in one mould.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an elastic sealing ring for
washing and drying machines and similar machines, for the
sealing between the edge of an opening in an outer wall
and a part of a door penetrating in said opening, whereby
said sealing ring has a ring-shaped body and a fastening
flange provided on the end thereof protruding outwards as
seen from the radial direction for the fastening onto the
outer wall and an elastic, deformable lip protruding
inwards as seen from this radial direction which forms
the actual sealing and is designed to fit up against the
penetrating part of the door.Washing machines usually have a drum which is mounted
such that it can revolve in a tub. The whole is
surrounded by a housing in which the tub is fixed by
means of springs and/or rubber blocks. In an outer wall
of this housing, namely the front panel in what is called
a front loader, a filling opening is provided which is
closed by means of a door, which is usually equipped with
a tub-shaped glass part. The sealing ring not only
provides a sealing between this door and the outer wall,
but also closes off the opening between said outer wall
and the drum with its body, and therefore is fixed to the
frame on the inside of the housing.Consequently, this sealing ring must not only provide a
sealing, but must also be able to absorb vibrations both
during the start-up with an unbalanced load as during 
different rotational speeds, it must be resistant to
detergents and oils and to temperatures up to 120Â°C, it
must be sufficiently non-abrasive and must have enough
flexural strength and must reassume its original shape as
much as possible after having been pressed together for
a certain time.A sealing ring according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0 266 239.In order to meet these requirements as well as possible,
the known sealing rings of good quality are made of
natural or synthetic rubber.However, rubber is a relatively costly product, so that
such a sealing ring is relatively expensive. Moreover,
this sealing ring is relatively heavy. Its fastening
onto the outer wall does not only require a special shape
of the edge of the opening in the outer wall, since it is
stretched over an edge of said outer wall with its
outwardly protruding flange, moreover a straining ring
must be used for reasons of safety, which makes the
mounting of the sealing ring more difficult.
Furthermore, the shape of the outwardly protruding
fastening flange is relatively complex.Further, rubber is a material which cannot be recycled in
an

<CLAIMS>
Elastic sealing ring (1) for washing and drying
machines and similar machines, for the sealing between

the edge of an opening (8) in an outer wall (7) and a
part (12) of a door (9) penetrating in said opening (8),

whereby said sealing ring (1) has a ring-shaped body (2)
and a fastening flange (4) provided on an end thereof

protruding outwards as seen from the radial direction for
the fastening onto the outer wall (7) and an elastic,

deformable lip (3) protruding inwards as seen from this
radial direction which forms the actual sealing and is

designed to fit up against the penetrating part (12) of
the door (9), characterized in that the outwardly

protruding fastening flange (4) is made of a hard
material, whereas the elastic, deformable, inwardly

protruding lip (3) is made of a thermoplastic elastomer
with rubber-like qualities, which forms a whole with the

hard material of the fastening flange (4) as a result of
injection moulding onto or together with the hard

material in one mould.
Elastic sealing ring (1) according to the above claim,
characterized in that the hard material of which the

fastening flange (4) is made is a thermoplastic elastomer
with the qualities of hard plastic which is made together

with the rest of the sealing ring (1) in a mould by means
of injection moulding.
Elastic sealing ring (1) according to claim 1,
characterized in that the hard material of which the

fastening flange (4) is made is plastic which is made 
together with the rest of the sealing ring (1) in the

mould by means of injection moulding.
Elastic sealing ring (1) according to claim 1,
characterized in that the hard material of which the

fastening flange (4) is made is metal.
Elastic sealing ring (1) according to any of the above
claims, characterized in that also the body (2) of the

ring is made of thermoplastic elastomer.
Washing or drying machine or the like which has an
outer wall (7) which is provided with an opening (8), a

door (9) with a part (12) which, in closed position, has
penetrated in the opening (8), and a sealing ring (1)

which provides the sealing between the edge of the
opening (8) and the penetrated part (12) of the door (9)

and which is characterized in that the sealing ring (1)
is a ring according to any of the previous claims, in

that the fastening flange (4)) of hard material is fixed
around the opening (8) to the outer wall (7) so that the

elastic, deformable lip (3) is situated in or opposite
the opening (8).
Machine according to the above claim, characterized in
that the fastening flange (4) of hard material which is

fastened against the outer wall (7) forms an angle with
the body (2) which is different from the angle in the

case where the sealing ring (1) is not mounted so that
the lip (3), which forms an angle with this fastening

flange (4), also forms another angle with the body (2)
after the mounting of the sealing ring (1) than before

the mounting, and is put under an elastic strain in
relation to the body (2) after the mounting. 
Machine according to claim 7, characterized in that
the fastening flange (4) of hard material shows local

interruptions on the perimeter of the sealing ring (1).
