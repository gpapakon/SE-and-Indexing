<ABSTRACT>
An electrical adaptor is arranged to receive an electrical plug of one standard type and to be inserted into sockets of other standard types. There are a plurality of pins which may be selectively extended from the adaptor to conform with various standard sockets. The adaptor is provided with external earth contacts, for instance for co-operation with European socket earth contacts, and has a sprung cover which conceals the earth contacts and may be retracted for use.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRICAL ADAPTORThe present invention relates to electrical adaptors which allow an electrical appliance connected to a conventional plug according to one standard to be connected to an electrical supply outlet of a type according to a different standard.It is known, for instance in GB-B-2097202, now assigned to the present applicant, to provide such an adaptor. However, the adaptor described in that document has a complex arrangement of connectors within the adaptor for providing earth connections. Also, the connections for European style sockets "wiping earth" contacts are provided on the outer surface of the adaptor which gives an unsightly appearance.In general terms the present invention provides an adaptor as described above having a simplified earthing arrangement and in which all of the connections need only be exposed when required for use. In particular, the present invention provides an electrical adaptor comprising a plurality of socket contacts arranged to receive an electrical plug, a plurality of pins adapted to be selectively extended through an end surface of said adaptor in a plurality of configurations, each of said pin configurations being suitable for insertion into and connection with a respective standard electrical socket, and means within the adaptor arranged to make appropriate live and neutral connections between a plug inserted into said socket contacts and the pins when in position for insertion into an electrical socket; the adaptor further comprising external earth contacts on a side surface of the adaptor arranged to make earth contact with an electrical socket, a cover arranged to conceal said earth contacts when in a first position and to expose said earth contacts when in aSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 second position and resilient biasing means arranged to urge said cover into said first position.In order that the present invention may be better understood a preferred embodiment thereof will be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:Figures la and lb show two perspective views of the preferred embodiment;Figure 2 shows the rear end of the adaptor with a selector plate removed;Figure 3 illustrates one of the pins incorporated in the preferred embodiment;Figure 4 is a view corresponding to Figure 2 but with the selector plate in position;Figure 5 shows' a perspective view corresponding to Figure lb with- a cowling of the adaptor retracted;Figure 6 is a sectional view through the preferred embodiment; andFigure 7 shows the earthing

CLAIMS :
1. An electrical adaptor comprising a plurality of socket contacts arranged to receive an electrical plug, a plurality of pins adapted to be selectively extended through an end surface of said adaptor in a plurality of configurations, each of said pin configurations being suitable for insertion into and connection with a respective standard electrical socket, and means within the adaptor arranged to make appropriate live and neutral connections between a plug inserted into said socket contacts and the pins when in position for insertion into an electrical socket; the adaptor further comprising external earth contacts on a side surface of the adaptor arranged to make earth contact with an electrical socket, a cover arranged to conceal said earth contacts when in a first position and to expose said earth contacts when in a second position and resilient biasing means arranged to urge said cover into said first position.
2. An electrical adaptor according to claim 1 having first and second substantially parallel, flat end surfaces, said plurality of pins being extendible through said first end surface and said plurality of socket contacts being arranged behind apertures in said second end surface whereby to receive pins of an electrical plug inserted through said apertures.
3. An electrical adaptor according to claim 2 in which said first end surface has a smaller area that said second end surface and the adaptor has a tapered shape when said cover is in said first position.
SUBSTITUTESHEET 


 4. An electrical adaptor according to claim 1, 2 or 3 in which said resilient biasing means is a helical spring. "
5. An electrical adaptor according to any of claims 1-4 in which one of said plurality of pin configurations is arranged to co-operate with a standard European-style socket.
6. An electrical adaptor according to claim 5 in which said external earth contacts are arranged to coÂ¬ operate with earth contacts in a standard European-sytle socket.
7. An electrical adaptor according to any of claim 1-6 in which one of said plurality of pin configurations is arranged to co-operate with a standard North American socket.
8. An electrical adaptor according to any preceding claim arranged to receive a UK standard 13 amp 3 pin plug.
