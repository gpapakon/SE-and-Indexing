<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a synchronisation method for an automation system (1) constructed redundantly from at least two partial systems (2, 2'). According to the invention, the sequences of machine commands (MP) for the partial systems (2, 2') contain run-time queries. Upon reaching the run-time queries, the actual run-time since the last synchronisation of the partial systems (2, 2') is determined, but a synchronisation is only then carried out if the actual run-time exceeds a preselectable synchronisation pattern. The run-time queries are in this case inserted always into the series of machine commands (MP) if the accumulated run-time expected value of the machine commands (MP) since the last run-time query exceeds a preselectable limiting time.

<CLAIMS>
A synchronisation method for a redundant automation 
system (1) constructed from at least two sub-systems 

(2, 2'), the sub-systems (2, 2') being 
interconnected via communication means (9), and 

having the following features: 

identical sequences of machine instructions (MP) 
for the sub-systems (2, 2') are executed in 

parallel in the sub-systems (2, 2'), the sequences 
of machine instructions (MP) containing run-time 

queries; 
when one of the sub-systems (2, 2') reaches a run-time 
query, the actual run-time of that sub-system 

(e.g. 2) since the last synchronisation of the sub-systems 
(2, 2') is determined; 
a synchronisation routine is invoked in that sub-system 
(2) if the run-time of that sub-system (2) 

exceeds a preselectable synchronisation reference 
pattern 
Synchronisation method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that when one of the sub-systems 

(e.g. 2) reaches a run-time query, the run-time 
query is only executed when the other sub-system 

(e.g. 2') reaches the corresponding run-time query 
in its sequence of machine instructions (MP). 
Synchronisation method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the sequences of machine 

instructions (MP) are produced from an application 
program (AP), 


the run-times of the machine instructions being 
summed to obtain a run-time expected value when the 

sequences of machine instructions (MP) are 
generated, and  

 
a run-time query being inserted into the sequence 
of machine instructions (MP) and the run-time 

expected value is reset at the latest when the run-time 
expected value exceeds a preselectable time 

limit. 
Synchronisation method according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that a run-time query is always 

inserted into the sequence of machine instructions 
(MP) prior to branch instructions. 
Synchronisation method according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that a run-time query is always 

inserted into the sequence of machine instructions 
(MP) prior to conditional branch instructions. 
Synchronisation method according to Claim 3, 4 or 
5, characterised in that the time limit is less, in 

particular considerably less, than the 
synchronisation reference pattern. 
Generation method for generating a sequence of 
machine instructions (MP) from an application 

program (AP) for the sub-systems (2, 2') of a 
redundant automation system (1) constructed from at 

least two sub-systems (2, 2'), 

the run-times of the machine instructions 
being summed to obtain a run-time expected 

value when the sequences of machine 
instructions (MP) are generated, and 
a run-time query being inserted into the 
sequence of machine instructions (MP) and the 

run-time expected value is reset at the latest 
when the run-time expected value exceeds a 

preselectable time limit. 
Generation method according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that a run-time query is always 

inserted into the sequence of machine instructions 
(MP) prior to branch instructions. 
Generation method according to Claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that a run-time query is always 

inserted into the sequence of machine instructions 
(MP) prior to conditional branch instructions. 
Generation method according to Claim 7, 8 or 9, 
characterised in that the time limit is less, in 

particular considerably less, than a 
synchronisation reference pattern for synchronising 

the sub-systems.
