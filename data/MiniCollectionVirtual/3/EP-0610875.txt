<ABSTRACT>
A method for transmitting facsimile documents from a facsimile store-and-forward 
service computer (50) to a networked computer system (20). The networked 

computer system includes a central server computer (22) and one or more 
computers (34) coupled to the central server computer. According to a first 

embodiment of the present invention, the central server computer is programmed to 
determine whether the facsimile store-and-forward service computer has received a 

facsimile document for a particular user of the networked computer system. If so, the 
central server causes the facsimile store-and-forward service computer to transmit the 

facsimile documents to the central server computer. Upon receipt, the central server 
computer opens a file that is associated with the particular user and stores the 

facsimile document in the file. According to a second embodiment of the present 
invention, the facsimile store-and-forward service computer is programmed to 

transmit any received facsimile documents to the central server computer upon 
receipt. The service computer inserts a code into a header block that is transmitted 

with the facsimile document to indicate to the central server computer who is the 
intended recipient of the facsimile document. After receiving the header block, the 

central server computer reads the code and identifies the intended recipient, opens a 
file associated with the intended recipient, stores the received facsimile document in 

the file and notifies the intended recipient that a facsimile document has been received.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communication systems in general and in 
particular to facsimile and data communication systems. In the past ten years, the two devices that have probably had the greatest 
impact on the way modem business is conducted are the personal computer and the 
facsimile (fax) machine. Facsimile machines have revolutionized the speed at which 
replicas of documents can be transmitted from one place to another. With a facsimile 
machine, copies of documents can be sent all over the world almost instantaneously, 
without the delay, cost, or uncertainty that accompanies sending original documents 
through the mail. Similarly, personal computers have also changed the modem business 
environment. With a personal computer, large numbers of documents can be stored, 
retrieved, edited and printed with virtually the touch of a button. A facsimile-compatible 
modem, together with appropriate software, allows a user to combine the 
benefits of both computer and facsimile technology in a single machine. With a 
facsimile-compatible modem and software to control it, it is possible to send and 
receive facsimile documents to and from a computer. While facsimile-compatible 
modems generally work well, there are situations where it is either too costly or 
impractical for every computer user who wishes to have the ability to send and receive 
fax messages on a computer to buy a facsimile-compatible modem and the required 
telephone line services. One way of making computer-based faxing more affordable is  
 
to share the modem, software, and required telephone line services via a computer 
network. In the past few years, networked computer systems, so-called local area 
networks (LANs), have become the predominant way of connecting more than one 
computer together. A typical LAN system includes a central server computer, and a& 
plurality of satellite computers that are coupled to the central server computer and to 
each other, by electrical or fiber optic cables. Local area networks allow the plurality 
of satellite computers to share software programs and data as well as computer 
hardware such as printers, disk drives or facsimile-compatible modems. As described above, it is possible for a networked computer system to be 
equipped with a single facsimile-compatible modem so that each user of the network 
can send and receive facsimile documents directly from their computer. Facsimile-compatible 
modems are typically coupled to the central server computer and have a 
single telephone line
