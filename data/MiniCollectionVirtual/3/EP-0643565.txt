<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve noise damping in a cleaning device with a suction turbine for providing vacuum extraction, with an electric motor powering said turbine and forming a structural unit therewith, with a housing (1) containing the turbine and a sound-insulated device securing the turbine and the electric motor to the cleaning device, it is proposed that the securing device be a sleeve (5) of a duroplastic elastomer with a Shore hardness of between 30 and 60, it surround the turbine housing (1) and bear against the surface of the outer wall (6) of the housing (1) at least in regions, the turbine be fitted in the cleaning device with its axis of rotation running vertically and the sleeve pass below the turbine-motor unit and freely suspend it on the cleaning device.

Cleaning device having a suction turbine for generating a 
current of suction air, an electric motor driving the 

suction turbine and forming a structural unit with the 
suction turbine, a housing (1) accommodating the turbine 

and a holder soundproofing and securing the turbine and 
the electric motor on the cleaning device, the turbine 

being arranged with the axis of rotation of the turbine 
extending in the vertical direction in the cleaning 

device, characterized in that the holder is a sleeve (5) 
made of a duroplastic elastomer with a Shore hardness of 

between 30 and 60, in that it surrounds the turbine 
housing (1) and lies at least area-wise with surface-to-surface 

contact against the outer wall (6) of the housing 
(1), and in that the sleeve (5) engages below and carries 

the structural unit comprised of turbine and motor 
suspended freely on the cleaning device. 
Cleaning device as defined in claim 1, characterized in 
that the turbine housing (1) has a circular-cylindrical 

vertical outer wall (6) against which the sleeve (5) 
rests with full surface-to-surface contact. 
Cleaning device as defined in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the sleeve (5) has an inwardly projecting step 

(10) on which the turbine housing (1) rests.  
 
Cleaning device as defined in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the turbine housing (1) and 

the sleeve (5) have projections and recesses (13) which 
engage positively with one another and prevent turning of 

the turbine housing (1) relative to the sleeve (5) about 
a vertical axis. 
Cleaning device as defined in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the sleeve (5) has a 

supporting flange (15) protruding outwardly at the top 
rim. 
Cleaning device as defined in claim 5, characterized in 
that an annular groove (16) open downwardly is arranged 

in the supporting flange (15). 
Cleaning device as defined in one of claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the inwardly projecting step (10) 

and/or the supporting flange (15) and/or the outer wall 
(14) of the sleeve (5) carry vertical reinforcement fins 

(11, 18, 20) extending radially. 
Cleaning device as defined in claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the supporting flange (15) has recesses or 

projections (17) engaging positively with projections or 
recesses on the cleaning device and preventing turning of 

the sleeve (5) relative to the cleaning device about a 
vertical axis. 
Cleaning device as defined in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the inner diameter of the 

sleeve (5) is smaller than its outer diameter immediately 
above the turbine housing (1).  

 
Cleaning device as defined in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the sleeve (5) rests with 

its bottom end at least area-wise with surface-to-surface 
contact against the outer wall of a housing (2) 

accommodating the electric motor.
