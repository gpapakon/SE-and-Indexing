<ABSTRACT>
To allow data to be exchanged between a printing 
drum and a stencil printing device main body in a 

highly adaptable manner with regard to the increase in 
the kinds of data to be transmitted without requiring 

any change in mechanical structures, light emitting 
devices (43,65) and light receiving devices (45,63) are 

arranged in mutually opposing parts of the printing 
drum (7) and the main body frame (1) for require optical 

communication between them. Other modes of wireless 
communication may be used in place of the optical 

communication. This invention is particularly useful 
when the printing drum (7) is detachably mounted on a 

main body frame (1) of the stencil printing device, and 
the main control unit is required to adapt itself to 

different printing drums.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary stencil 
printing device, and in particular to a rotary stencil 
printing device including a printing drum detachably 
mounted on a stencil printing device main body, and a 
printing drum adapted to be used in such a stencil 
printing drum. According to well known stencil printing devices, 
printing ink is supplied to the interior of a printing 
drum, and printing paper is pressed, by a press roller, 
onto a stencil master plate wrapped around the outer 
circumferential surface of the printing drum to achieve 
a desired stencil printing. Some of such stencil 
printing devices are provided with a printing drum 
which is detachable from the stencil printing device 
main body so that stencil printing of different colors 
can be achieved by changing the printing drum as 
required. Such a stencil printing device is disclosed 
in Japanese patent publication (kokoku) No. 62-28758. According to such a stencil printing device, 
because an ink supply system, including an ink supply 
pump, an ink level sensor and so on, is provided inside 
the printing drum, and is controlled by a control unit 
consisting of a microcomputer or the like provided in 
the stencil printing device main body, it is necessary 
to exchange data between the printing drum and the 
stencil printing device main body. Conventionally, two halves of a multi-pin 
connector were provided in the printing drum and the 
stencil printing device main body, respectively, so 
that the two halves may be connected to each other by 
the mounting of the printing drum onto the stencil  
 
printing device main body, and the data transmission 
between the printing drum and the stencil printing 
device main body may be achieved electrically via the 
connector and the wiring associated with the connector. However, according to such a conventional mode of 
data transmission, as the kinds of data to be 
transmitted between the printing drum and the stencil 
printing device main body increases primarily due to 
the diversification of the kinds of the printing drums, 
the numbers of pins and wires associated with the 
connector have to be increased accordingly, and this 
limits the adaptability of the stencil printing device 
to the increase in the kinds of data to be transmitted. In view of such problems of the prior art, a 
primary object of the present invention is to provide 
an improved rotary stencil printing device equipped 
with a printing drum detachably mounted on a stencil 
printing device main body which allows
