<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel compounds that 
exhibit unusually low electrical resistivity at room 

temperature. More specifically, it has been discovered 
that the incorporation of at least 1 to 15 atomic percent 

of gallium and/or at least 1 to 15 atomic percent gold 
into stoichiometric copper germanide (Cu₃Ge) compound 

results in a room temperature resistivity comparable to 
elemental copper, but with superior chemical and 

electronic stability upon exposure to air or oxygen at 
high temperatures. Furthermore, the compounds of the 

present invention have none of the problems associated 
with the diffusion of copper into elemental and compound 

semiconductors which oftentimes lead to the degradation of 
the semiconductor device characteristics. Additionally, 

the present invention relates to a method of preparing the 
novel compounds mentioned previously hereinabove.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to pending U.S. application 
Serial No. 818,027 filed on January 7, 1992 to the same 
assignee. This application is also related to U.S. 
application Serial No. 876,669 filed on April 30, 1992 to 
the same assignee. The present invention relates to novel metal alloy 
compounds that exhibit room temperature electrical 
resistivity comparable to that of elemental copper. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to highly 
oxidation resistant compounds having low resistivity at 
room temperature comprising a body of stoichiometric 
copper germanide (Cu₃Ge) containing about 1 to 15 atomic 
percent gallium and/or gold. Furthermore, the present 
invention relates to a method of preparing the highly 
oxidation resistant compounds. The continued miniaturization of integrated circuits has 
brought about an increasing need to reduce the resistance 
in interconnect and contact metallurgy. In recent years, 
much effort has been focused on the use of metal silicides 
to fulfill this need. However, as semiconductor device 
dimensions become even smaller, both horizontally and 
vertically, silicides lose their attractiveness. The 
intrinsic resistivity of the silicides is high compared to 
metals, while the formation of self-aligned silicides 
consumes silicon in proportion to the thickness of the  
 
silicide that is formed. This consumption usually leads 
to junction leakage which is intolerable. Copper, because of its low resistivity, has been used for 
interconnect and contact application in VLSI and related 
technologies. However, copper exhibits a high diffusivity 
in silicon and is generally believed to be detrimental to 
the performance of silicon due to Cu-induced recombination 
centers which can reduce the minority carrier lifetime. 
One possible solution to this problem is the use of copper 
silicide. However, copper silicide reacts readily with 
oxygen upon exposure to air or oxygen resulting in 
degradation of its electrical transport properties. 
Another possible solution to this problem is to alloy the 
copper with other metals. However, this typically results 
in an increase in the resistivity of the alloyed material. 
Thus, research is ongoing in an attempt to provide a 
material for semiconductor devices that has low 
resistivity and is highly stable when exposed to air or 
oxygen for use in interconnect and contact applications. One such material for use in semiconductor devices is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,198,999 to Baker et al.
