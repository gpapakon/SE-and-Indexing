<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a composite bearing structure 
which can withstand high speed rotation. The composite 

bearing structure comprises first, second and third 
bearing means. The first bearing means, which is adapted 

to support radial impact force being applied to a rotator 
during rotation, is formed by an inner ring (1) and an 

outer ring (2) of silicon nitride ceramic sintered bodies. 
The second bearing means, which is adapted to support an 

axial load being applied to the rotator while maintaining 
a prescribed clearance between the same and the rotator, 

is formed by two permanent magnets (12, 13) being thrust-directionally 
opposite to each other. The third bearing 

means, which is adapted to maintain radial rotational 
accuracy of the rotator, is formed by a radial dynamic 

pressure producing groove (5) being provided on a 
cylindrical surface of the inner ring (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bearing structure 
in general, and more specifically, it relates to a 
composite bearing structure for supporting a rotator which 
has a prescribed load and rotates at a high speed. In general, a member forming a rotary part which is 
provided in a laser printer, a facsimile, a bar code 
reader or the like must be capable of withstanding high 
speed rotation. With increase in the printing speed, for 
example, a rotator of a polygon mirror which is provided 
in a laser printer must rotate at a speed of at least 
20000 r.p.m. In a sliding portion of such a rotator, a 
ball bearing is generally applied to a bearing, for 
example. So far as such a conventional ball bearing is 
employed, however, the rotator can merely withstand a 
rotating speed of about 16000 r.p.m. at the maximum, due 
to problems of burning, wear and the like. JP-A-2 173 610 (1990) 
proposes an air bearing (dynamic pressure gas bearing) of 
ceramics such as SiC or Si3N4, which is employed for a 
rotary sliding portion in order to drive a polygon mirror  
 
of a laser printer at a high speed. Upon rotation of a 
rotator which is supported by such an air bearing, air is 
forcibly introduced into at least a clearance between a 
radial bearing member or a thrust bearing member and the 
rotator through a groove. Thus, the air pressure in the 
clearance is so increased that the rotator rotates at a 
high speed through the air bearing which is provided 
between the members. In order to implement such high 
speed rotation, rotational accuracy is maintained during 
high speed rotation through the air bearing, which is also 
adapted to support a thrust-directional load being applied 
to the rotator. The radial bearing member and the 
rotator, which are formed by ceramics, can withstand 
sliding between the members in a low speed region upon 
starting or stopping of the rotator. When a conventional radial bearing member of ceramics 
such as Si3N4 or the like is employed at a high rotating 
speed exceeding 5000 r.p.m., however, an impactive knock 
wear phenomenon results from contact between the bearing 
members. Namely, such radial impact force being applied 
to the rotator during high speed rotation causes sliding 
between the members in a high speed region, and it is 
difficult for a conventional ceramic sintered body to 
withstand such high speed sliding. When the radial or 
thrust bearing member is formed by an air bearing member  
 
which is prepared from a ceramic sintered body, therefore, 
it is difficult
