<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with
methods for preparing 2-n-Butyl-4-chloro-1-[(2'-(2-triphenylmethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-1H-imidazole-5-methanol.The successful development of orally active
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, e.g.,
captopril, enalapril, etc., for the treatment of
hypertension and congestive heart failure has generated
great interest in designing new pharmacological blockers
of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). As angiotensin
II (AII) is the primary effector molecule of the RAS
(Peach, J. J., Renin-Angiotensin System:Biochemistry and
Mechanism of Action, Physiol. Rev., 1977, 57:313-370), a
receptor antagonist of All would provide a direct
approach to block the system. A number of peptide
analogs of All have been reported to have All receptor
antagonist properties; however, they also retain partial 
agonist properties and lack oral activities (Corvol, P.,
New Therapeutic Prospects of Renin-Angiotensin System
Inhibition, Clin. Exp. Hypertens.-Theory & Practice,
1989, All (Suppl. 2), 463-470). More recently,
following the disclosure of a few nonpeptide All
antagonist leads (U.S. 4,355,040), several series of All
antagonists have been synthesized at E. I. du Pont
de Nemours and Company. Many of these compounds are
orally active with potent activities (Wong, P. C.,
et al., Functional Studies of Nonpeptide Angiotensin II
Receptor Subtype-Specific Ligands:DuP753 (AII-1) and
DP123177 (AII-2), J. Pharm. and Exp. Ther., 1990, 255
(2), pp 584 to 592 and references therein). These novel
compounds were disclosed in European Patent Application
0 324 377 published July 19, 1989.Many of the All receptor antagonists have the
biphenyl structure as a portion of the molecule.
Synthetic methods for the preparations of biphenyls were
reviewed recently (Bringmann, G., et al., Angew. Chem.
Int. Ed. Engl., 29, 1990, 977 to 991). Also Duncia,
et al. (U.S. 4,820,843 and J. Org. Chem., 1991, 56,
2395-2400) described alternate preparations of
biphenyls. The preparation, properties, and uses of
boronic acids and derivatives were summarized in Metal-Organic
Compounds, Advances in Chemistry Series, #23,
American Chemical Society, 1959. The ortho-lithiation
of 2-substituted 5-phenyl-tetrazoles was disclosed in
U.S. 5,039,814.The invention relates to a process for preparing
