<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for continuously mixing powdery or fine-grained building materials with water and for transporting the wet mixture. The device has an elongated, horizontally orientated continuous mixer (10), which can be attached to a silo (14) for building materials, and an elongated mixture pump (20) having an inlet chamber (50), which can be attached to a mixture outlet (18) of the continuous mixer (10), and a pumping zone (58), in which arrangement there passes through both the continuous mixer (10) and the mixture pump (20) in their longitudinal extent (48) in each case a motor-actuated drive shaft, each bearing transporting and/or mixing tools. According to the invention, the mixture pump (20) is orientated in its longitudinal extent (48) transversely to the longitudinal extent (40) of the continuous mixer (10) with pumping zone (58) tilted down at an angle, the angle of tilt being less than 45 DEG  relative to the horizontal (26), and the inlet chamber (50), through which the relevant drive shaft (48) passes, of the mixture pump (20) having a base (68) correspondingly tilted towards the pumping zone (58).

A device for the continuous mixing of pulverulent or 
fine-grain building materials with water and for conveying 

the mixture, with an elongate, horizontally positioned 
continuous mixer (10), which can be mounted on a frame (22) 

erectable on a substantially horizontal substrate (24) and 
which comprises a charging zone (32) connectable to a 

building material supply container (14), a metering zone 
(34) and a mixing zone (36), which can be additionally acted 

upon by water (46), and an elongate mixture pump (20) which 
comprises an inlet chamber (50) connectable to a mixture 

outlet (18) of the continuous mixer (10) and comprises a 
pump zone (58), the continuous mixer (10) and the mixture 

pump (20) each being penetrated in their longitudinal 
extension by a motor-actuated drive shaft (62) supporting 

conveying and/or mixing tools (64), characterised in that 
the mixture pump (20) is arranged on the frame with its 

longitudinal extension (axis 48) transversely to the 
longitudinal extension (axis 40) of the continuous mixer 

(10) and beneath the continuous mixer (10) with a downwardly 
inclined pump zone (58), the angle of inclination relative 

to the horizontal (26) being less than 45° and the inlet 
chamber (50) of the mixture pump (20) which is penetrated by 

the respective drive shaft (48) comprising a floor (68) 
which is correspondingly inclined relative to the pump zone 

(58). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the angle of inclination of the mixture pump (20) in its 

longitudinal extension (48) relative to the horizontal (26) 
is between 50° and 20°. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the inlet chamber (50) of the mixture pump (20) 

comprises a buffer zone (52) on the continuous mixer side 
outside the drive shaft (62) and a compression zone (54) on  

 
the pump zone side, which is penetrated by the drive shaft 

(62). 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the compression zone (54) is formed by a pipe attachment 

(54), which points downwards at an angle, communicates with 
the inlet chamber (50) and opens into the pump zone (58). 
A device according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the buffer zone (52) occupies more than 25% and less 

than 80%, preferably approximately 50% of the overall volume 
of the inlet chamber (50). 
A device according to one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the compression zone (54) occupies 

less than 20% but more than 5% of the overall volume of the 
inlet chamber (50). 
A device according to one of claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that, in the region of the buffer zone 

(52), the inlet chamber (50) comprises a preferably oval 
cylindrical attachment with an inlet aperture (70) opening 

towards the top, and the outlet opening (72) of the mixture 
outlet (18) of the continuous mixer (10), which opens 

towards the bottom into the inlet aperture (70), extends in 
the longitudinal extension of the mixture pump over at least 

60% and in the transverse direction over 30 to 60% of the 
inlet aperture (70). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the mixture pump (20) is either 

pivotable about a substantially vertical axis (74) or is 
horizontally displaceable (guide 80) relative to the mixture 

outlet (18) of the continuous mixer (10). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the projection of the structural unit  

 
consisting of the mixture pump (20) and the continuous mixer 

(10) to the horizontal substrate (26) is located within the 
base (24) of the frame (22). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the structural unit consisting of the 

continuous mixer (10) and the mixture pump (20) can be 
connected and secured by means of a connecting flange (12) 

located in the inlet zone (32) of the continuous mixer (10) 
to an outlet flange of the storage container (14) preferably 

constructed as a ready-mixed mortar silo. 
A device according to claim 10, characterised in that a 
frame housing (16) for receiving drive and/or control 

aggregates (82) is arranged on the underside of the 
continuous mixer (10), and the mixture pump (20) is 

articulatedly connected (74) to or displaceably guided (78,
