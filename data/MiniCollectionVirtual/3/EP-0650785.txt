<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 10 
and method for positioning and pressing surgical needle 

blanks. The apparatus includes a needle blank transferring 
system 14 which transfers needle blanks between a gripping 

position 20 and a pressing position 16. A side press 
system 74, 76 presses a portion of the needle blank when 

the blank is in the pressing position, and a gripping 
member 12 is provided to hold the needle blank at least 

during the transfer and press operations of the apparatus. 
The method according to the present invention includes 

inserting a needle blank into a needle blank gripping 
member at a gripping position, transferring the needle 

blank between the gripping position and a pressing 
position, and pressing a side portion of a body portion of 

the needle blank with pressing dies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
side pressing surgical needles. More particularly, the
present invention relates to an apparatus for sequentially
positioning and side pressing curved surgical needles.The production of needles involves many processes
and different types of machinery in order to prepare quality
needles from raw stock. These varying processes and machinery
become more critical in the preparation of surgical needles
where the environment of intended use is in humans or animals.
Some of the processes involved in the production of surgical
grade needles include, inter alia: straightening spooled wire stock;
cutting needle blanks from the wire stock; providing a bore
for receiving suture thread at the other end of the blank;
tapering or grinding points on one end of the blank; flat
pressing a portion of the needle blank to facilitate easier
grasping by surgical instrumentation; and curving the blanks
where curved surgical needles are desired. To further
facilitate grasping of the needle blank by surgical 
instrumentation and to facilitate insertion into humans or
animals, a body portion of the curved needle blank may be side
pressed.Conventional needle blank processing is, in large
part, a labor intensive operation requiring highly skilled
labor. Generally, extreme care must be taken to ensure that
only the intended working of the needle blank is performed and
the other parts of the needle blank remain undisturbed. For
example, conventional flat pressing techniques create the flat
edges on the body portion of the needle blank by pressing the
needle blank between a pair of opposing needle dies having the
desired length and width characteristics. Typically, the
needle blanks are manually placed on a lower die and
compressed between the dies to impart the flat surfaces. The
flat pressed blanks are then manually removed from the dies
and deposited into a storage receptacle for distribution to
another production machine.As noted above, to facilitate grasping of the needle
and insertion into body tissue, after flat pressing and
curving, the needle blank is then side pressed to obtain a
substantially rectangular cross-section in the needle body.
As with the above flat press process, conventional side
pressing techniques require manual insertion of the blank
between a pair of dies which are caused to impact and compress
the sides of a body portion of the needle blank opposite to
those surfaces which were flat pressed to form the substantial
rectangular cross-section in the needle

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10) for positioning and pressing
at least one surgical needle blank (48) having a body

portion, which comprises:

means (14) for transferring the at least one
needle blank between a gripping position (20) and a

pressing position;
a gripping assembly (12) attached to said needle
blank transferring means;
means (50, 52, 53) for moving the needle blank
from said gripping position which is in a first level to said

pressing position which is in a second level;
means (54) for moving the needle blank from a
first level to a second level between said gripping

position and said pressing positions; and
means (16) for side pressing at least the body
portion of the needle blank when the needle blank is in the

pressing position.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
said needle blank transferring means (14) is adapted to

transfer the needle blank to a release position after the
needle blank is side pressed.
The apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein said needle blank transferring means comprises:


means (54) at a position intermediate the
gripping and the pressing positions for moving the needle

blank between said first level and said second level.
The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein
said first level is associated with said gripping position

and said second level is associated with said pressing
position. 
The apparatus according to claim 3 or 4,
wherein said means (54) for moving the needle blank between

said first level and said second level comprises a
rotatable arm (56) having said needle gripping assembly

attached thereto at a radial distance from an axis of
rotation of said arm.
The apparatus according to any of the
preceding claims, wherein said gripping assembly (12)

comprises:

a housing (22);
at least two gripping fingers (34) at least
partially positioned within said housing, each said at

least two gripping fingers having a biasing end portion and
a gripping end portion (34a) which is movable between open

and closed positions; and
means (30) for engaging said biasing end portion
of said at least two gripping fingers to move said gripping

end portion between said open and closed positions.
The apparatus according to claim 6, wherein
said biasing end portion of said at least two gripping

fingers is adapted to bias said gripping end portion toward
said open position.
The apparatus according to any of the
preceding claims, wherein said gripping assembly further

comprises a needle stop member (42).
A method for pressing surgical needle
blanks, comprising the steps of:
