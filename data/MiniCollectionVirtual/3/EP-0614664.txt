<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an animal cell adhesion inhibitory composition which comprises a 4-oxo-3-quino-linecarboxylic
acid or 4-oxo-3-naphthyridinecarboxylic acid derivative possessing cell adhesion inhibitory activity, a
novel 4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid derivative and a method of production thereof.The present invention is generally directed to the regulation or inhibition of cell adhesion to provide a therapeutic
agent for various diseases.Factors associated with animal cell adhesion to extracellular substrates include fibronectin, vitronectin, osteopontin,
collagen, thrombospondin, fibrinogen and the von Willebrand factor. These proteins contain the tripeptide -Arg-Gly-Asp-
as a cell recognition site. This tripeptide is recognized by at least one protein belonging to the category of receptor
integrin, a hetero-dimer protein consisting of two membrane-bound subunits [E. Ruoslahti and M.D. Pierschbacher, Science,
238, 491 (1987)].Structurally related integrin receptors which recognize the amino add sequence -Arg-Gly-Asp- are known to be
expressed in platelet extracellular surface glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa, endothelial cells, leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes
and granulocyte. Any compound having the amino acid sequence -Arg-Gly-Asp- competitively binds to cell adhesion
factor adherent site to inhibit the binding of the cell adhesion factor. Such cell adhesion inhibitors include H-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-OH.Upon vascular vessel damage, platelets are activated by vascular endothelial collagen etc., resulting in fibrinogen
binding thereto, i.e., platelet aggregation, leading to thrombosis. The platelet-fibrinogen interaction is mediated by
GPIIb/IIIa, an important aspect of platelet aggregation. Cell adhesion inhibitors are capable of inhibiting platelet aggregation
caused by platelet aggregation inducers, such as thrombin, epinephrine, ADP and collagen.Also, cell adhesion inhibitors are expected to serve as drugs to suppress cancerous cell metastasis (inhibition of
adhesive fixation at metastetic site).Conventional cell adhesion inhibitors include linear or cyclic peptides containing the amino acid sequence -Arg-Gly-Asp-
[e.g., Journal of Biochemistry, 262, 17294 (1987); Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.
174797/1990].On the other hand, some quinolonecarboxylic acid compounds are commercially available as useful antimicrobial
agents, but their cell adhesion inhibitory action is unknown.Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 251667/1986 describes that a benzoheterocyclic compound
