<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a laser with medium to high power, especially a solid-state laser having a pumping source (16), an active material (18), especially a laser rod, and two mirrors (26, 30) which form the laser resonator. A mechanically and thermally stable laser can be produced with low expenditure by arranging the pumping source (16), the laser rod (18), the cooling system and the mirrors (26, 30) in a monolithic housing block (12).

<CLAIMS>
A solid state laser comprising a pump source (16) 
having an active material (18) and at least an additional 

optical component (26, 30) forming at least a laser 
resonator, said pump source (16), said active material (18) 

and said additional components (26, 30) being disposed in a 
monolithic housing block (12), a space for said pump source 

and a space for receiving said active material being formed 
by a cavity of said monolithic housing block (12) in which 

a cooling system in the form of a cooling circuit is 
contained which is provided for cooling said active 

material (18), said pump source (16) and said additional 
components (26, 30) of said laser. 
The laser according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said housing block (12) is made of fiber-reinforced 

synthetic material. 
The laser according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said housing block (12) is made of glass, glass ceramics, 

ceramics or metal having an electrically insulating and 
non-corrosive surface. 
The laser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said optical components (26, 

30) are connected to each other by means of axial, 
mechanical stiffening elements (32). 
The laser according to claim 4, characterized in that 
said active material (18) is connected to said stiffening 

elements (32).  
 
The laser according to claims 4 or 5, characterized in 
that said stiffening elements (32) are held in said housing 

block (12) with mechanical dampening. 
The laser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that terminals of a cooling system 

and electrical terminals for said laser components are 
merged on one side of the housing block, and that said 

terminals are formed as plug-in terminals to be connected 
to a support means. 
The laser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that further optical and 

mechanical components for beam generation and/or beam 
guiding are disposed in the housing block. 
The laser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a measuring and positioning 

system for compensating mechanical or thermal deformations 
is provided which acts on the support means of at least one 

component of the laser resonator. 
The laser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a wall is removeably fixed to 

the housing block and that all components of the resonator 
are individually and radially disposed in the housing block 

in a manner enabling assembly and disassembly.
