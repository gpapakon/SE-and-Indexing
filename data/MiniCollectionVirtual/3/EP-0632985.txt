<ABSTRACT>
A bottom structure (2) of a bed (1) having a bottom formed so as to 
be bendable by a series of paralleled strips (5) mutually sequentially 

connected such that the strips (5) are shorter in width on the side away 
from the sequentially connected side. In this way the bottom structure 

(2) of the bed (2) allows a portion of a bed bottom (2) to be bent in a 
large curvature, thus is provided a bed (1) which is comfortable and 

highly adaptable for patients of various body sizes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bottom structure of a
bed which allows the bottom to be bent upward, forming a large
curvature such that it does not cause a patient to feel any
discomforting pressure. The present invention also relates to a bottom
structure of a bed which allows a patient to experience minimum
physical discomfort irrespective of his body size when the bottom
structure of a bed is bent, forming a large curvature in the leg
portion corresponding to the leg or knee position of the patient or
forming a large curvature in the waist portion of the patient.In many recent beds, e.g. as shown in DE-A-3912442, the
bottom structure is divided into a back portion, waist portion, leg
portion etc. to allow the back portion and/or the leg portion to be
raised by a drive. In these beds the bottom structure can be bent
upward to alter the position of the back portion or knee portion,
using various mechanisms.Thereby in DE 3912442 the bottom structure comprises a
number of longitudinal members extending in the longitudinal direction
of the bottom structure. Said longitudinal members which are interconnected
by traverses can be bent for forming a desired curvature in
the bottom structure.FR-A-2624711 discloses a bottom structure comprising hollow
strips having a rectangular cross section and being interconnected by
two parallel belts.The present invention provides a bottom structure of a bed
as defined in claim 1. Figure 1 is a side illustration showing an essential region
of a bed having a bottom structure with a leg portion according to the
present invention.Figure 2 is an enlarged side view showing a cross section
of the leg portion shown in the figure 1.Figure 3 is an enlarged side view showing a cross section
of the bottom of another embodiment. Figure 4 is a side illustration showing an essential region of a bed having a bottom
structure with a back portion of the present invention.Figure 5 is an enlarged side view showing a cross section of the back portion shown in
Figure 4.Figure 6 is an enlarged side view showing a cross section of the back portion of another
embodiment.Figure 7 is an illustration showing a bottom structure of a bed where the bottom is
covered with a flexible sheet.Figure 8 is an illustration showing a bottom structure of a bed where a flexible sheet is
laid on the upper side of the bottom structure.Figure 9 is an illustration showing a bottom structure of a bed where a mattress (or other
material) is caught in the bottom structure.The bottom structure of a bed according to

<CLAIMS>
A bottom structure of a bed (1, 11) comprising a base (2,
12) formed so as to be bendable and comprising a series of parallel

hollow strips (5, 13) mutually sequentially connected and extending
perpendicular to the longitudinal length of the bottom structure and

over the width of said bottom structure the connections of the strips
being located on the upper or lower side of the base and extending

over the whole length of said strips, said strips (5, 13) being formed
by thermoplastic molding and being shorter in width, measured

longitudinally of the bottom structure, on the side away from the
connected side than on the connected side.
A bottom structure of a bed according to claim 1 wherein a
series of strips (5) are connected on the under side and form a part

of the bottom structure which is bent forming a large curvature below
the plane extending through the ends of the bottom structure and a

series of strips (13) are connected on the upper side and form a part
of the bottom structure which is to be bent forming a large curvature

above the plane of the bottom structure.
A bottom structure of a bed according claim 1 or 2, wherein
said parallel strips (5, 13) are substantially trapezoidal in shape in

cross section.
A bottom structure of a bed according to any preceding
claim wherein a gap (7, 17) is formed between the parallel strips (5,

13) at the interconnected shorter side forming an angle of about
16 degrees.
A bottom structure of a bed according to any preceding
claim wherein said parallel strips (5) are formed in trapezoidal

shapes only at about the lower halves of the strips.
A bottom structure of a bed according to any preceding
claim further comprising a leg portion raising mechanism (16).
A bottom structure of a bed according to any preceding
claim further comprising a back portion raising mechanism (15).
A bottom structure of a bed according to any preceding
claim wherein said bottom (12) can be bent upward to an angle of about

80 degrees. 
A bottom structure of a bed according to any preceding
claim further comprising a flexible sheet (21) covering the entire

bottom structure (12) at the side away from the connected side.
