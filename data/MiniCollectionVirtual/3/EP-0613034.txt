means (6, 15, 44, 45) including an AF motor control circuit 
(15, 45) for driving and controlling an AF motor (16, M1) and 

thereby moving the focussing lens along the optical axis of 
the lens application (3) and comprises a focus position detection 

means (19, 48). The focus position detection means 
(19, 48) is set to a predetermined value every time when the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a control device for a camera operating in a
manual and in an auto focussing mode. The camera
also comprises 
an image magnification
control device, wherein a photographic lens
for the camera, including single lens reflex cameras and
video still cameras, is driven and controlled by a zoom
drive means so as to automatically control an image
magnification of the photographic lens to a
predetermined magnification.A desireable feature for a power zoom camera is
to be able to maintain a constant image magnification of
an object as the distance between the object and the
camera varies. For instance, when taking a series of
continuous photographs of, for instance, a baseball
player running to catch a ball, the photographer may
wish that the baseball player occupies the same area of
the film frame as the player moves. This can be
accomplished by varying the focal length of the lens when the 
player moves. Unfortunately, an individual can not
change the magnification value (by changing the focal
length of the lens) fast enough and accurately enough to
achieve the desired result.Over the years camera manufacturers have developed
power zoom lenses for lens shutter cameras. This enables
a photographer to quickly and smoothly change the focal
length of the camera lens. Lens shutter cameras
typically employ a triangulation technique to
determine the distance of an object to be photographed
from the camera. In the triangulation technique,
infrared or ultrasonic rays are
emitted by the camera. They are reflected from the
object to be photographed and returned to the camera.
By utilizing the triangulation technique, the distance,
"a" of the object can be determined.The magnification value of a lens shutter camera
is determined by the equation m=f/a, where "m" equals
the magnification value, "f" equals the focal length of
the lens and "a" equals the distance of the object from
the camera. If a constant image size is to be
maintained, the lens shutter camera must merely
determine the distance of the object from the camera
and change the focal length of the lens according to
the above equation, so that the magnification value 
"m", remains constant. This is easily accomplished
with a power zoom. auto-focus, lens shutter camera.Many individuals prefer using interchangeable lens
cameras, such as SLR cameras, because a plurality of
different lenses can be easily attached to the camera
body. It would be desirable to enable an
interchangeable lens camera to maintain
a constant image size as the object
