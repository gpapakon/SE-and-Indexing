<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a gas injection system for a household appliance, of the type including a support (1) for an injector fed with gas via a gas supply tube (2), this system being capable of operating with at least two gases. According to the invention, the support (1) includes a calibrated hole (10) for allowing direct operation with a first gas. When it is necessary to operate the system with the other gas, it is sufficient to place a piece (4) on the support (1), which piece (4) comprises a second hole (40) located in axial extension of the calibrated hole (10), this second hole (40) being itself calibrated to allow the system to operate with this gas. The present invention is applicable for any kind of household appliance using gas as fuel.

Gas injection system for a household appliance
capable of running on at least two gases, the system

being of the type comprising a support (1) for a
removable injector (4) for a first gas, supplied with

gas via a gas inlet pipe (2), and being characterized
in that the said support (1) has a hole (10) which is

calibrated to run directly with a gas other than the
first gas when the removable injector (4) has been

removed.
Gas injection system for a household appliance
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the support

(1) also has a counterbore (11) axially in line with
the calibrated hole (10).
Gas injection system for a household appliance
according to either one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the removable injector is formed
of a removable part (4) surmounting, when fitted, the

support (1) and having a second hole (40) placed
axially in line with the calibrated hole (10), this

second hole being smaller in size than the calibrated
hole and being itself calibrated to run with the first

gas.
Gas injection system for a household appliance
according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the hole (10) in the said support
(1) is calibrated to run directly on natural gas.
Gas injection system for a household appliance
according to Claim 3 or Claim 4 when the latter is 

dependent on Claim 3, characterized in that the second
hole (40) is calibrated so that the system can run on

butane.
