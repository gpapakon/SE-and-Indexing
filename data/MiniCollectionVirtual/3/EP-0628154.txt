<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a conventional grand piano according to the
precharacterized portion of claim 1, a lower lid for a grand piano
according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 16, a
lower lid assembly according to the precharacterizing portion
of claim 21 and a method of projecting sounds from within a
grand piano according to the precharacterizing portion of
claim 24.Such a conventional grand piano, lower lid, lower lid assembly and
method are known from US-A-4 211 142.The primary sound radiating component of a grand
piano is its soundboard. The soundboard is
horizontally oriented within the piano's case. The
bottom of a conventional grand piano is open, so that
sound can radiate downward from the soundboard
directly to the surface on which the piano rests.A conventional grand piano has a hinged cover (to
be referred to herein as a "top lid") which can be
raised into an open position. When the top lid is
propped in its open position, sound radiating upward
from the soundboard is reflected by the top lid
toward the front side of the piano (the curved side
of the piano, which is on the right side of a pianist
facing the keyboard).US-A-4,211,142, issued to Conklin,
discloses attachment of a large bottom panel below
the soundboard of a grand piano to reflect sound
propagating downward from the soundboard toward the
rear side of the piano. Conklin's panel reflects
sound in the opposite direction than the top lid of
the piano to which it is attached. Conklin suggests
that the bottom panel can be convex so at to reflect
sound toward the ends of the piano (toward the
keyboard and away from the keyboard) as well as
toward the rear side of the piano. Conklin's bottom
panel has hinges 22 along one edge, and Conklin 
teaches that the hinges can be attached to the piano case, or to brackets
connected to the piano case, to enable the panel's free edge to be raised by a
cable or chain 25 slightly above floor level during transportation of the piano.US-A-2,138,669, issued to Tower, discloses a tone deflector for a grand piano,
which consists of a set of slanting vanes 13 fixedly mounted to the piano case
under the soundboard. Tower teaches that some or all of the vanes can be
mounted in orientations for deflecting sound toward the piano's rear side, and
that some or all of the vanes can be mounted in orientations for deflecting
sound toward the piano's front side. However, Tower's vanes are small, and
would not have sufficient surface area to project sound efficiently outward from
the soundboard. The
