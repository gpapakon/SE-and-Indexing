METHOD AND KIT FOR DIAGNOSING AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSISField of the InventionThis invention relates to the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Background of the InventionAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. (Charcot 1877; Mulder et al. 1969; Appel et al. 1986; Rowland 1984) Its major effect is the compromise of both upper and lower otoneurons, and while it spares the intellect, it produces irreversibly progressive weakness and paralysis, culminating in respiratory failure and death. Numerous studies attempting to implicate viruses, toxins (especially excitotoxins) , and loss of trophic influences in ALS have provided, at best, weak circumstantial evidence. (Rowland 1984; Williams et al. 1991) While a genetic etiology has been described for ALS, familial ALS accounts for less than 10% of diagnosed cases. (Siddique et al. 1991; Mulder et al. 1986)Autoimmunity has more recently been implicated in the causation of sporadic cases of ALS. Clinical studies supporting such a potential role for autoimmunity include both an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders in ALS patients 1877) and an increased incidence of paraproteinemias. Younger et al. 1990; Meininger et al. 1990) Numerous reports have documented the presence of 

circulating or deposited immune complexes in ALS patients. (Oldstone et al. 1976; Palo et al. 1978) Post-mortem microscopic analysis of ALS tissues reveals the presence of IgG within upper and lower motoneurons, and the presence of inflammatory foci of T-cells and reactive microglia within the spinal cord ventral horn. (Engelhardt et al. 1990) Direct investigations have failed, however, to confirm the role of humoral autoimmunity in tissue culture (Horwich et al. 1974; Touzeau et al. 1986), and have failed to confirm reactivity of IgG against various antigens using immunoblot techniques. (Hauser et al. 1986; Ordonez et al. 1989) Further, they have not defined the presence of antibodies against "novel growth factors" (e.g., glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) , thought by some to be decreased in ALS (Chaput et al. 1988; Ingvar-Marden et al. 1986), and have failed to demonstrate sensitivity and specificity of anti-ganglioside and neurofilament antibodies reported in some patients with ALS. (Endo et al. 1984; Pestronk et al. 1989; Stefansson et al. 1985)An alternative approach providing evidence for autoimmunity in ALS has been the development in guinea pigs of two distinct models of immune-mediated otoneuron
