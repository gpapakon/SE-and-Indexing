A recombinant polypeptide comprising an active part derived from a
polypeptide having a therapeutic activity, genetically coupled to an

albumin or a variant of albumin, wherein the variant of albumin
conserves a high plasma half-life, 
characterised in that
 the
polypeptide having a therapeutic activity is chosen from among

hormones, interferons, interleukins, erythropoietin, G-CSF
and insulin.
A polypeptide according to Claim 2 
characterised in that
 the
polypeptide having a therapeutic activity is a polypeptide of human

origin.
A polypeptide according to Claim I or 2 
characterised in that
 the
active part has a structure chosen from


(a) an entire peptide structure or
(b) a fragment of (a) or a structure derived from (a) by structural
modification (mutation, substitution, and/or deletion of one or

more residues) and conservation of therapeutic activity.
A polypeptide according to one of Claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that

the albumin or albumin variant has a structure chosen from:

(a) mature albumin;
(b) albumin; and
(c) a structure derived from (a) or (b) by structural modification
(mutation, substitution, addition and/or deletion of one or more

residues) and conserving a high plasma half-life.
A polypeptide according to one of Claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that

the polypeptide comprises an N-terminal methionine.
A polypeptide according to one of Claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that

the polypeptide comprises a linker peptide.
A polypeptide according to one of Claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that

the polypeptide comprises a secretion signal.
A polypeptide according to Claim 8 
characterised in that
 the
secretion signal is the natural secretion signal of the biologically

active polypeptide.
A polypeptide according to one of Claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that

the active part is coupled to the N-terminus of the albumin.
A polypeptide according to one of Claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that

the active part is coupled to the C-terminus of the albumin.
A polypeptide according to one of Claims 1 to 10 
characterised in
that
 the active part is represented several times.
Nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide according to one of
Claims 1 to 11.
A nucleotide sequence according to Claim 12 
characterised in that
 it
comprises a sequence encoding a "leader" sequence permitting the

secretion of the expressed polypeptide.
An expression cassette comprising a nucleotide sequence according
to one of Claims 12 and 13 under the control of a transcription

initiation region and optionally a transcription termination region.
A self-replicating plasmid comprising an expression cassette
according to Claim 14. 
A recombinant eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell in which has been
inserted a nucleotide sequence according to Claim 12 or 13 or an

expression cassette according to Claim 14 or a plasmid according to
Claim 15.
A recombinant cell according to Claim 16 
characterised in that
 it is a
yeast, animal, fungal or bacterial cell.
A recombinant cell according to Claim 17 
characterised in that
 it is a
yeast cell.
A recombinant cell according to Claim 18 
characterised in that
 it is a
cell from the genus 
Saccharomyces
 or 
Kluyveromyces.
A process for preparing a polypeptide as defined in one of Claims 1
to 11 
characterised in that
 one cultivates a recombinant cell
according to one of Claims 16 to 19 under conditions for expression

and one recovers the polypeptide product.
A pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more polypeptides
according to Claims 1 to 11 or prepared by a process according to

Claim 20.
A pharmaceutical composition comprising a nucleotide sequence
according to one of Claims 12 to 14 usable in gene therapy.
