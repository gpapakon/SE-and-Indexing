<ABSTRACT>
Two rotors (3,4) and one stator (2) are arranged coaxially. The stator (2)
comprises a coil unit (6) which produces, by the supply of a first alternating

current, the same number of rotating magnetic fields as the number of magnetic
poles of said first rotor (3), and, by the supply of a second alternating current,

the same number of rotating magnetic fields as the number of magnetic poles of
said second rotor (4). A composite current of said first and second alternating

currents is supplied to said coil unit (6), and a circuit (15) is provided for
compensating torque fluctuation due to non-uniformity of the magnetic field

accompanying the relative rotation of the two said rotors (3, 4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the structure of a motor/generator.Tokkai Hei 8-340663 published by the Japanese Patent Office in 1996
and related European application EP 0 725 474 A disclose a motor/generator comprising two rotors and one stator coaxially
arranged in three layers wherein one of the rotors is driven as a motor and the
other is driven as a generator.In this motor/generator, two sets of coils are installed in the stator for
providing a magnetic field for respective rotors, and two sets of inverters, i.e.,
current controllers, are provided for controlling respective sets of coils.However, in the case of this motor/generator, since two sets of coils and
inverters are required, current losses such as copper losses or switching losses
are large.It is therefore an object of this invention to reduce current losses of a
motor/generator having the construction described in the prior art.In order to achieve the above object, this invention provides a motor /generator
comprising a first rotor comprising plural magnetic poles and supported free to 
rotate, a second rotor comprising plural magnetic poles and supported free to
rotate coaxially with the first rotor, a stator fixed co-axially with the first rotor,
and a coil unit comprising plural coils disposed at equal angular intervals on
the stator, wherein the coil unit forms plural rotating magnetic fields of equal
number to the number of magnetic poles of the first rotor according to a first
alternating current and forms plural rotating magnetic fields of equal number
to the number of magnetic poles of the second rotor according to a second
alternating current.The motor/generator further comprises an electrical circuit for supplying a
composite electrical current comprising the first alternating current and the
second alternating current to the coil unit, and a circuit for compensating a
torque fluctuation produced in either of the two rotors due to the non-uniformity
of the magnetic field accompanying the relative rotation of the first rotor and
second rotor.The details as well as other features and advantages of this invention are
set forth in the remainder of the specification and are shown in the accompanying
drawings.Fig. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a motor/generator according
to this invention.Fig. 2 is similar to Fig. 1, but showing a second embodiment of this
invention.Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of a control circuit according to this invention. Fig. 4 is a schematic cross-sectional view of an inverter according to this
invention.
