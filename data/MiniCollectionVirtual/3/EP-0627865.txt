<ABSTRACT>
To implement different interface conditions in the ISDN subscriber line area or respectively in ISDN subscriber terminals, special integrated circuits, so-called Telecom ICs, are used. To avoid competitive bus situations when at least two modules of these Telecom ICs wish to reserve access at the same time, controllers are needed for controlling and securing the information transmission. A method for reserving time slots by means of a simple circuit arrangement is specified according to the invention. A request for reservation is signalled by a time slot reserving unit (ZRE). A collision detection unit (KEE) checks whether other modules may wish to access the bus and allocates a time slot to the module having the highest priority if an allocation status memory (BZS) has first detected a free time slot. The method can be generally used in serial data transmission and competitive bus situations by means of a very economical circuit.
