<ABSTRACT>
Recessed WC basin provided on the opposing sides with a plurality 
of holes or hollow spaces (26) perimetrally arranged for housing 

plugs which lock a net (32) from recyclable thermoplastic 
material. 
Window (50) and end pipe union (34) are offset relatively to the 
vertical axis of cabinet (12). 
The window (50) is circumscribed by a frame (44) provided with one or 
two branches (46) developed towards the inside to support float 

ball (52). 
A one-piece drain (54) is provided with a tubular element (56) 
suitable to fit in pipe union (34), integral with a flexible 

strip (60) which develops up to window (50) to allow an easy 
introduction or removal of said drain (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recessed WS basin. More in 
particular, this invention relates to a basin for washing WC 
bowls. The basin subject matter of this invention has been designed and 
constructed to achieve the following objects: 
easy assembly, which makes the production process reliable; easy and correct installation; easy maintenance: in fact, all the compoments are "use-error-proof"-designed, 
thanks to special technical devices which allow 
to reinsert the replacement detail in the correct position; perfect hydraulic tightness between the elements which 
constitute the waste apparatus; more efficient and quicker downflow of waste water, to ensure a 
perfect washing of the WC bowl. As is known, bowls are usually installed in bath-rooms, which are 
connected to above standing wall-fastened water basins. When required, the water contained in the basin is discharged in 
said bowl.  WC basins are usually made from plastic, metal and ceramic 
material, and may be applied either outside or inside the wall. Externally applied basins have a removable lid, which gives 
access to the inside, to perform operations of installation, 
maintenance or replacement of the various components, such as, 
for instance, float ball, valve, gaskets and so on. Internally applied, i.e. recessed basins, are housed in a special 
hollow space or directly cemented in the thickness of the wall, 
above the bowl. This second type of basin is very common and ofted preferred, 
especially in small bath-rooms, as it does not take up room and 
it allows to put the bowl very near the wall. The utilization of 
recessed basins allows also to obtain an aesthetical advantage, 
as only a panel of limited size is fastened to the wall to cover 
the opening and the inspection hollow space necessary for 
maintenance. The panel may be provided with a button which causes 
the delivery of the water downflow. However, the known recessed basins have severe drawbacks, both  
 
during the installation stage and in the stage of maintenance or 
replacement of the components contained in the inside. A first drawback takes place during the stage of installation of 
the basin into the recess provided in the wall and concerns the 
fact that the net utilized to facilitate the anchoring of the 
plastering, is caused to be integral with the opposing surfaces 
by simple glueing. This connection of the net is quite precarious 
and tends to detach, partly or fully, so that the net has to be 
re-fixed to the basin walls, to allow the anchoring of the 
plasterin

WC recessed basin comprising a cabinet (12) having a 
substantially parallelepipedal shape and a limited depth, 

provided in its lower part with a pipe union (34) and flanges 
(16, 22) placed on the tops and provided with holes (18, 24) for 

the connection to masonry, as well as an opening or window (50) 
on the front surface (12''), characterized in that said pipe union 

(34) and window (50) are offset relatively to the vertical axis 
of said basin. 
WC basin acording to claim 1, characterized in that pipe union 
(34) is integral with basin (12), being obtained in the moulding 

stage. 
WC basin according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in 
that basin (12) is provided on one or both the front and the back 

surfaces, with a plurality of dead holes or hollow spaces (26) 
where stems (28) of plugs are pressure fitted which fasten a 

portion of the tightly-meshed net (32). 
WS basin according to any of the above claims, characterized 
in that it is provided on the front surface (12'') and near the 

 
pipe union (34) with two or more coupled prints (38), which are 

more marked towards the inside and which constitute the guide for 
the self-centering of a drain (54). 
WC basin according to any of the above claims, characterized 
in that drain (54) is integrally obtained and is constituted by a 

tubular element (46) to which a flexible strip (40) is connected 
wich reaches with its top end the height of window (50) when said 

drain is placed in its final seat in the union drain (34). 
WS basin according to any of the above claims, characterized 
in that the upper end of a flexible strip (60) is provided with a 

means which allows the connection to frame (44), constituted by a 
snap-element which fits into a special elastic seat. 
WS basin according to any of the above claims, characterized 
in that opening (50) is perimetrally circumscribed by a frame 

(44) which is connected by at least a branch (46) to the back 
wall (48) to form a support for the float ball group (52). 
WC basin according to any of the above claims, characterized 
in that it is provided, on both the front and back surfaces, with 

 
two or more prints (40) whose ends are connected to one another 

within the basin and to one another by a special stiffening 
depression.
