<ABSTRACT>
The present invention pertains to easy-open/reclosure devices (20) 
for containers, and more particularly to easy-open/reclosure devices 

that are intended to be applied to the top lid (12) of a beverage 
container (10) having a flat top. In particular the easy-open/reclosure 

device will form a concave trough-shaped pouring spout by deformation of 
an essentially flat pouring lip (32) upon application to the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to easy-open/reclosure 
devices for containers, and more particularly to easy-open/reclosure 
devices that are intended to be applied 
to the top lid of a beverage container having a flat 
top. In particular the easy-open/reclosure device will 
form a concave trough-shaped 
pouring spout by deformation of an essentially 
flat pouring lip upon application to the container. For the user's convenience, most beverage containers 
are provided with some type of easy-opening feature, 
examples of which include a pre-scored pull tab in the 
container's lid or an adhesive tape covering a pre-cut 
dispensing aperture. These types of easy-open beverage 
containers are generally acceptable if the container's 
contents are entirely consumed or dispensed shortly 
after opening. However, in instances where the 
container's contents are only partially consumed and 
stored, these containers are objectionable and 
inconvenient because they cannot be reclosed. The 
absence of a reclosing feature not only makes it 
difficult to keep the container's contents fresh and 
foreign matter such as dirt and dust from entering the 
container, but also makes it very difficult and awkward  
 
Recent attempts to provide an easy-open beverage 
container with reclosing means have only achieved 
partial success. One such attempt is generally shown in 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,164,303 and 4,232,797, both to 
Waterbury. Waterbury discloses several embodiments of 
an articulated closure element that is hingedly 
attached to the top lid of a container having a 
peripheral rim. The closure element has a depending 
plug or bead on its undersurface that is shaped 
complementarily to a pre-cut dispensing aperture in the 
container's lid. After the container is initially 
opened and a portion of its contents dispensed, the 
container may be reclosed by returning the closure 
element to its original position such that the 
depending plug or bead enters the dispensing aperture. Although Waterbury's articulated closure element does 
allow a beverage container to be reclosed after it is 
initially opened, consumers nevertheless find this 
general type of reclosable container to be 
objectionable. Specifically, when a portion of the 
beverage is dispensed, some of the beverage inevitably 
becomes trapped between the container's dispensing 
aperture and upstanding rim or runs down its side walls 
if there is no rim. After the container is returned to 
its upright position, this residual tends to spread out 
over the container's

<CLAIMS>
An easy-open/reclosure device (20) for application 
to the top lid (12) of a container (10) having 

along its peripheral edge (16) an essentially flat 
top surface, said top lid (12) having a pre-cut or 

pre-scored dispensing aperture (18) therein, said 
device (20) comprising: 


a) a base portion (22) having a dispensing aperture 
(28) therethrough and a bottom surface; 
b) a flange (30) depending downwardly from said 
bottom surface of said base portion (22) and 

encircling said base dispensing aperture (28), 
said flange (30) having inner and outer surfaces 

and a bottom edge, said flange being shaped 
complementary to said pre-cut or pre-scored 

dispensing aperture (18) in said top lid (12), 
whereby said flange (30) enters said pre-cut 

dispensing aperture (18) or breaks through said 
pre-scored aperture (18) when said device (20) 

is applied to said top lid (12); 
c) a moveable portion (24) having a bottom surface 
and open and closed positions, said bottom 

surface having a plug member (34) having an 
outer surface and being shaped complementary 

to said base dispensing aperture (28) whereby said 
plug member (34) will readily enter and snugly 

engage said base aperture (28) when said 
moveable portion (24) is in its said closed 

position; and 
d) a deformable pouring lip/drain surface (32) 
extending outwardly from said base portion (22)  

 
and initially, in its relaxed state, lying 

substantially in the same plane as said base portion (22): 
 
said device (20) being characterized in that
 
said deformable pouring lip/drain surface (32) has 

a downwardly depending deformation rim (42, 44, 46, 
48), said deformation rim coming into intimate 

contact with said flat top surface of said top lid 
12) and thereby bends said deformable pouring 

lip/drain surface (32) into an upwardly-inclined, 
trough-shaped configuration when said device (20) 

is applied to said top lid (12) of said container 
10). 
The easy-open/reclosure device (20) recited 
in claim 1 whereby said moveable portion (24) is 

hingedly attached to said base portion (22). 
The easy-open/reclosure device (20) recited in any 
of the preceding claims wherein said outer surface 

of said depending flange (30) includes means for 
tightly securing said device (20) to said top lid 

12) of said container (10). 
The easy-open/reclosure device (20) recited in 
Claim 3 wherein said means for tightly securing 

comprises a snap bead projecting outwardly from 
said outer surface of said flange (30) or a step 

(31) projecting inwardly from said outer surface of 
said flange (30). 
The easy-open/reclosure device (20) recited in any 
of the preceding claims wherein said outer surface 

of said plug member (34) and said inner surface of 
said depending flange (30) include cooperating 

means for securing said plug member (34) within 
said base dispensing aperture (28).  

 
The easy-open/reclosure device (20) recited in 
Claim 5 wherein said cooperating means for securing 

comprises a step projecting outwardly from said 
outer surface of said plug (34) and a step 

projecting inwardly from said inner surface of said 
depending flange (30), or a snap bead projecting 

outwardly from said outer surface of said plug (34) 
and a groove in said inner surface of said 

depending flange (30). 
The easy-open/reclosure device (20) recited in any 
of the preceding claims wherein said deformation 

rim (42, 44, 46, 48) comprises two parts following 
the contour of said pouring lip/drain surface (32) 

essentially to the extend to which said pouring 
lip/drain surface (32) overlaps with said top lid 

(12). 
The easy-open/reclosure device (20) recited in any 
of the preceding claims wherein said deformation 

rim (42, 44, 46, 48) has a height perpendicular to 
said pouring lip/drain surface (32) which is 

increasing in proportion to the distance from said 
dispensing aperture (28).
