An infeed plate of an axial separator consisting of a region (46), with a plate (54), disposed
upstream relative to the transverse direction and a region (50), with a ramp (58), disposed

downstream relative to the transverse direction, wherein the ramp (58) runs more steeply than the
plate (54), characterized in that a conically extending section (52), whose inclination is smaller

than that of the ramp (58), adjoins the inclined plate (54) in the direction of flow in the region
(46) lying upstream.
An infeed plate of an axial separator consisting of a region (46), with a plate (54), disposed
upstream relative to the transverse direction and a region (50), with a ramp (58), disposed

downstream relative to the transverse direction, wherein the ramp (58) runs more steeply that the
plate (54), characterized in that the ramp (58) in the region (50) lying downstream ends in a rim

(66) which projects partially over a guide plate (60) following the ramp (58) in the direction of
flow.
An infeed plate according to clams 1 and 2.
An infeed plate according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the ramp
(58) curves.
An infeed plate according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the ramp
(58) is provided with or is attached to a convergent side plate (64).
An infeed plate according to claim 5, characterized in that an obliquely extending ramp (62)
extends between the side plate (64) and the ramp (58).
An infeed plate according to claim 6, characterized in that the obliquely extending ramp (62) is of
semi-cylindrical form.
An infeed plate according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the region
(46) lying upstream is provided with a convergent side plate (56). 
An axial separator with a rotor housing (38) and a rotor (39) rotatably mounted therein for
separating harvested material in a combine harvester, characterized by an infeed plate according

to one or more of claims 1 to 8 disposed in the intake region of the rotor (39).
An axial separator according to claim 9, characterized in that a feed drum (20) extending
transversely relative to the flow direction is mounted ahead of the infeed plate.
