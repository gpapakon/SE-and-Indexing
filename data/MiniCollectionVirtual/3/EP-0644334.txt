<ABSTRACT>
An air impeller comprising a fan (12) situated within the 
air duct and driven by a switched-reluctance motor, air impelled 

by the fan passing through the rotor ()2) of the motor. Air 
guides (20) may be interposed between the motor armature and the 

fan. The fan may be a centrifugal fan. The impeller is 
applicable to vacuum cleaners, air-cushion-supported lawn mowers, 

leaf blowers, air conditions, hand driers, hair driers, hot-air 
heaters and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to air impellers, in particular 
electrically driven air impellers, and to devices incorporating 
such air impellers, for example vacuum cleaners, air-cushion-supported 
lawnmowers, leaf blowers, air conditioners, hand 
driers, hair driers, hot-air heaters and the like. Such impellers comprise an electric motor driving a fan to 
provide the air flow. The motor is normally of the induction 
type and requires cooling. This is generally provided by a 
separate flow of cooling air generated by an additional fan 
mounted on the armature shaft, or it may be provided by part or 
all of the air flow generated by the main fan being caused to 
pass over the outside of the motor. The present invention, which is defined in the appended 
claims, depends on the use of a motor of the switched-reluctance 
type. The armature of such a motor has salient poles without any 
windings and so presents a large "window" through which air can 
flow. Such motors can run at high speeds, which makes them 
particularly suitable for driving centrifugal fans. Preferably the motor is positioned upstream of the fan, so 
that it is not subjected to the heat generated by the fan and is, 
therefore, more efficiently cooled. The motor armature itself produces a pumping action and this 
may be further increased by appropriate shaping of the pole 
pieces. Air guides may be positioned downstream of the rotor to 
redirect the flow of air as it leaves the armature. The invention will be further described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which  Figure 1 is a diagrammatic end view of a motor to be used 
in the present invention. Figure 2 is an axial section through an air impeller 
according to the invention. Figure 3 is a longitudinal section through a wheeled 
domestic vacuum cleaner incorporating the invention. Referring first to Figure 1 which is a much simplified end 
view of the motor, the motor comprises a stator 1, the windings 
and pole structure of which are not shown in the figure, and a 
rotor or armature 2. The motor is of the switched-reluctance 
type, designed to run at 40 000 rpm and areas 3 between the rotor 
poles, shown shaded, are not occupied by windings, and so present 
a large area allowing for the free passage of air through the 
motor. The pole pieces are of a slightly oblique section, so as 
to exert a pumping action as they rotate. Figure 2 is an axial section through an air impeller 
designed to form part of a domestic vacuum cleaner. The impeller 
comprises an

<CLAIMS>
An air impeller comprising a fan situated within an air duct 
and driven by an electric motor, characterised in that the motor 

is a switched-reluctance motor and at least the armature of the 
motor lies within the duct so that air impelled by the fan passes 

through the armature.
