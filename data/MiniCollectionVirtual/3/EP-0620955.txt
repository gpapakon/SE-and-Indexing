<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns programmable gain 
amplifiers. More particularly, the invention concerns 
programmable gain amplifiers having impedance selection 
networks allowing programmability. A conventional programmable gain amplifier (PGA) 
configuration is shown in Fig. 1. Such a PGA is shown in 
"Flexible PGA Designs Require Few Components," by A. Kaniel, 
EDN Electrical Design News, Volume 32, No. 2, 22 January 
1987, Newton, Massachusetts, U.S., pages 181-187. In such a 
PGA, an amplifier 10 receives an input signal at an input 11 
and provides an output signal, determined by the gain of the 
amplifier, at its output 12. The gain of amplifier 10 is 
determined by the impedance in the feedback path to the 
feedback input 13 is determined by an impedance selector 14 
located in the feedback path between the output 12 and the 
feedback 13. By varying the impedance in the feedback path 
using the impedance selector 14, the gain of the PGA may be 
varied. The impedance selector may be, for instance, a 
variable resistor, or, as is often used in integrated 
circuits, a switch and resistor network. A conventional programmable gain amplifier using a switch 
and resistor network as the impedance selector 14 is shown in 
Fig. 2. In such a PGA, switches (S1-S4) introduce errors 
in the signal path, due to both thermal voltage noise and 
voltage errors  
 
caused by amplifier input bias currents flowing 
through the switches. The input bias current flowing 
through the switches causes voltage variations due to 
a changing switch resistance with respect to the 
common-mode voltage. This non-linear resistance 
variation results in non-linear voltages biasing the 
input. One way to decrease such errors in conventional 
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) PGA's 
is to increase the width of the CMOS switches, thus 
decreasing resistance. In an integrated circuit, 
however, an increase in the width of a switch results 
in an increased die area as well as additional 
capacitance. For low noise circuitry, the necessary 
safe area size for the switch can become a significant 
problem. As an alternative, a second switch may be used to 
offset variation in voltage caused by the first 
switch. This solution, however, increases both the 
noise caused by the switch and the die area of the 
integrated circuit. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a programmable gain amplifier 
that reduces errors associated with the switches. A programmable gain amplifier in accordance with
