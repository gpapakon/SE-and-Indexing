<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for manufacturing a composite yarn formed by combining continuous glass filaments with continuous filaments of a thermoplastic organic material. According to the invention, the thermoplastic filaments, in the form of a web (sheet) (10), are intermingled with a bundle (2) or web of glass filaments after they have been heated to a temperature above their conversion temperature, stretched and then cooled.

A method of producing a composite thread 
(6) formed by the association of continuous glass 

filaments (2, 23) emanating from a spinneret (1) 
and continuous filaments of thermoplastic organic 

material (5, 10) emanating from at least one 
spinning head (7), characterised in that the 

thermoplastic filaments (5, 10) are, in the form 
of a sheet (10), blended with a bundle (2) or 

sheet (23) of glass filaments and in that, prior 
to their penetrating the bundle (2) or sheet (23) 

of glass filaments, the thermoplastic filaments 
(10) are heated to a temperature higher than their 

transformation temperature, and are then drawn out 
and cooled. 
A method according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the thermoplastic filaments 

(5, 10) and the glass filaments (2, 23) are mixed 
at identical speeds over the outer surface of a 

roller (19). 
A method according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the thermoplastic filaments 

are projected in the form of a sheet (10) onto a 
bundle (2) or sheet (23) of glass filaments.  

 
An apparatus for producing a composite 
thread formed by the association of continuous 

glass filaments (2, 23) and continuous filaments 
of thermoplastic organic material (5, 10) 

comprising on the one hand at least one spinneret 
(1) which is supplied with glass and the underside 

of which is provided with a multiplicity of 
orifices and which is associated with a coating 

device (4), and on the other hand at least one 
spinning head (7) which is supplied with molten 

thermoplastic material and the underside of which 
is provided with a multiplicity of orifices, and 

means (3, 20), common to the spinneret (1) and the 
spinning head (7), allowing the assembly and 

drawing of the composite thread (6), characterised 
in that the thermoplastic spinneret (7) is 

associated with at least one drawing apparatus 
(11) of the drum type and heating and cooling 

means and means allowing thermoplastic filaments 
(5, 10) to be blended with glass filaments (2,23). 
An apparatus according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the drawing apparatus (11) 

has at least three groups of drums (12, 13, 14, 
15, 16, 17) ensuring an increasing speed of the 

thermoplastic filaments (5, 10).  
 
An apparatus according to claim 4 or 5,
 
characterised in that the heating means are 

electrical and are situated at least in the first 
drum (12) of the drawing apparatus (11). 
An apparatus according to claims 4 to 6,
 
characterised in that heating means, particularly 

of the infra-red type, are placed in the path of 
the thermoplastic filaments, at least at the level 

of the first drum (12). 
An apparatus according to claims 4 to 7,
 
characterised in that coo
ling is performed by 
circulation of cold fluid at least in the final 

drum (17) of the drawing apparatus (11). 
An apparatus according to claims 4 to 8,
 
characterised in that the means allowing 

thermoplastic filaments to be blended with glass 
filaments is composed of a guide roller (18) and a 

presser roller (19). 
An apparatus according to claims 4 to 8,
 
characterised in that the means allowing the 

thermoplastic filaments to be blended with glass 
filaments is a venturi device (22).
