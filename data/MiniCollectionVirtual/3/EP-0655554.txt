<ABSTRACT>
Method for correcting jerks (uneven) in a fuel-injected internal combustion engine (1) of the type incorporating an electronic engine management system (7) which, on the basis of predetermined strategies and on the basis of values taken by the characteristic parameters (N,Pcoll,Rp) of the operation of the engine (1) determines the values of the control parameters (Av,Ti) which control the operation of the engine, by means of which at least one control parameter (Av) is corrected in response to fluctuations in the engine torque, using the following steps:   - estimating the instantaneous value of the fluctuations in the engine torque by filtering the rotational speed (N) of the driveshaft; - determining the correction (CorrAv) to be applied to the said control parameter (Av) by application of a variable multiplying gain (G) to the said instantaneous value of the fluctuations in the torque, characterised in that the step for estimating the instanteous value of the fluctuations in the engine torque includes the following operations:   - calculating the mean rotational speed (N) by filtering the instantaneous rotational speed (N); - calculating the difference between the instantaneous rotational speed (N) and the mean rotational speed (N); - calculating the mean difference (N-N) between the instantaneous rotational speed (N) and the mean rotational speed (N) by filtering the difference (N-N) between the instantaneous rotational speed (N) and the mean rotational speed (N); - calculating the difference between, on the one hand, the mean difference (N-N) between the instantaneous rotational speed (N) and the mean rotational speed (N) and, on the other hand, the difference (N-N) between the instantaneous rotational speed (N) and the mean rotational speed (N).

A method for correcting torque bumping of a fuel injection internal
combustion engine (1) of the type comprising an electronic engine control system (7)

determining, on the basis of predetermined strategies and from values assumed by the
characteristic parameters (N, Pcoll, Rp) of the operation of the engine (1), the values

of the control parameters (Av, Ti) which control the operation of the engine, by
means of which at least one control parameter (Av) is corrected in response to the

oscillations of the engine torque, comprising the following stages:

estimation of the instantaneous value of the oscillations of the engine
torque by filtering of the speed of rotation (N) of the engine shaft,
determination of the correction (CorrAv) to be applied to the control
parameter (Av) by applying a variable multiplier gain (G) to this instantaneous value

of the torque oscillations,

characterised in that the stage of estimation of the instantaneous value of the engine
torque oscillations comprises the following operations:


calculation of a mean speed of rotation (
N
) by filtering of the
instantaneous speed of rotation (N),
calculation of the difference between the instantaneous speed of
rotation (N) and the mean speed of rotation (
N
),
calculation of the mean difference (
N-
N
) between the instantaneous
speed of rotation (N) and the mean speed of rotation (
N
) by filtering of the difference
(N-
N
) between the instantaneous speed of rotation (N) and the mean speed of
rotation (
N
),
calculation of the difference between, on the one hand, the mean
difference (
N-
N
) between the instantaneous speed of rotation (N) and the mean speed
of rotation (
N
) and, on the other hand, the difference (N-
N
) between the
instantaneous speed of rotation (N) and the mean speed of rotation (
N
).
A method for correcting torque bumping as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the filtering operations are carried out by first order low-pass

filters (71, 73), with unitary gain and a variable time constant (t). 
A method for correcting torque bumping as claimed in claim 2,
characterised in that the time constant (t) of the filters (71, 73) is adjusted as a

function of the values assumed by at least one characteristic parameter (N, Rp) of the
operation of the engine (1).
A method for correcting torque bumping as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the value of the gain (G) is adjusted as a function

of the values assumed by at least one characteristic parameter (N, Rp, Pcoll) of the
operation of the engine (1).
A method for correcting torque bumping as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the control parameter corrected in response to the

oscillations of the engine torque is the sparking advance (Av).
