<ABSTRACT>
Engineering thermoplastics which are thermoformable at relatively low temperatures are prepared from blends of selected proportions of polycarbonate or polyarylate resins and polyetherimide with siloxane-polyetherimide copolymer resins. The thermoplastics of the invention exhibit flame retardancy to a degree acceptable for their use in the fabrication of aircraft components, such as interior compartment panels. Preferred blends include as a major proportion of the polycarbonate resin component, selected polyester-carbonate resins containing chain units which are residues of isophthalic and terephthalic acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to thermoplastic molding 
compositions and more particularly to thermoformable 
compositions which are blends of polycarbonate and 
polyimide resins. Many applications, especially those in the 
transportation field, require that engineering 
thermoplastics be flame retardant. Polyetherimides, 
polycarbonates, siloxane polyetherimide copolymers, 
organopolysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymers and 
combinations thereof have been used as base resins for 
molding aircraft and automobile components as well as 
for insulation for wiring. In addition to possessing 
advantageous physical and chemical properties, they 
exhibit good flame retardant properties. See, for 
example, U.S. Patents 4,673,708, 4,629,759, 4,548,997, 
4,468,506, 4,387,193, 4,390,665, 4,268,429 and 
3,334,154. The engineering thermoplastics that are in current 
use vary in their flue retardant properties, 
durability and thermoformability. Many do not meet the 
current standards for the flame resistance of 
construction materials used for the interior of 
transport category aircraft. Such standards are 
embodied in the 1986 amendments to Part 25 - 
Airworthiness Standards - Transport Category Airplanes 
of Title 14, U. S. Code of Federal Regulations. (See,  
 
51 Federal Register 26206, July 21, 1986 and 51 Federal 
Register 28322, August 7, 1986). The flammability 
standards are based on heat calorimetry tests developed 
at Ohio State University. Such tests are described in 
the above-cited amendments to 14 C.F.R. Part 25. Other 
engineering thermoplastics that do meet the above-identified 
standards cannot be thermoformed in all 
circumstances, for example, in the construction of 
certain laminate panels, when the temperature range 
required for thermoforming exceeds the range for 
polymeric resin degradation. In EP-A-0 519 657 
ternary 
blends of a polyetherimide, a siloxane polyetherimide 
copolymer and a polycarbonate or co-polyester carbonate 
are described as thermoplastically moldable to 
fabricate articles possessing the physical and chemical 
resistance properties important for applications as 
aircraft cabin interior components, automobile parts, 
insulation for wiring and the like. In particular, 
this ternary blend results in an unexpected improvement 
in flame resisting performance and ductility. Further, 
certain ternary blends described meet or exceed the 
rigorous flammability standards that have been 
established for aircraft interior components. However, 
the exemplified blends (which do not include
