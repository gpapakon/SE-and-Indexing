<ABSTRACT>
In a crank mechanism for a windscreen wiper drive for a motor vehicle which consists of a lever (10) and a shackle connected thereto via an articulated joint (11) in which said shackle is articulated eccentrically on a driven gear wheel, especially a worm wheel (4) of the drive, and the lever (10) is or can be connected integrally in rotation to a wiper spindle (12), the shackle (8) and the lever (10) are articulatedly interconnected according to the invention via a bayonet-like joint (13) so that the crank mechanism can be dismantled without the need for tools. The fitting position which permits the connection of the shackle (8) and the lever (10) differs from any possible rotation position which these two components may assume during operation.

A crank mechanism of a driving assembly of a screen wiper for 
an automotive vehicle, comprising a lever (10) and a tongue 

(8) connected to the lever by way of a swivel joint (11), 
with the tongue (8) being eccentrically (7) hinged to an 

actuated gear wheel, in particular, a worm gear wheel (4), 
and the lever (10) being connected or connectible in a non-rotating 

way to a wiper shaft (12),
 
characterized in that the tongue (8) and the lever (10) are 

pivotally interconnected by a bayonet-type connection (13), 
with the tongue (8) and the lever (10), in the assembled 

position, taking a mutual rotary position which is different 
from each rotary position during operation. 
A crank mechanism as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the tongue (8) and the lever (10), in 

the coupled mounting condition, are approximately in extended 
relationship with respect to one another. 
A crank mechanism as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterized in that provided on one of the connecting ends 

(14) of the lever (10) is a connecting pin (15) of an out-of-round 
cross-section projecting in a direction transverse to 

the plane of movement of the lever, and in that the tongue 
(8) on the associated connecting end (18) comprises at least 

one introduction slot (16) for the connecting pin (15), which 
is laterally open at the edge, with the connecting pin on the 

inner end thereof passing to a slot extension limited by a 
circular arc and forming a bearing bore (21), or vice versa, 

and in that an imaginary envelope of the connecting pin (15)  
 

has a diameter (23) corresponding to the diameter of the 
bearing bore (21). 
A crank mechanism as claimed in claim 3,
 
characterized in that the lever (10) on the other end (24) 

thereof comprises a sleeve (25), in particular, provided with 
a blind bore (26) for accommodating the inner end of the 

wiper shaft. 
A crank mechanism as claimed in claim 4,
 
characterized in that a cambered support member (27) 

supportable inwardly on a housing lid of the driving assembly 
is provided on lever (10) approximately opposite the sleeve 

(25). 
A crank mechanism as claimed in at least one of claims 3 to 
5,
 
characterized in that the tongue (8) at its end (18) 

connected to the lever (10) is of a bifurcated configuration, 
with the associated lever end (14) gripping between the fork 

spikes of the tongue (8), and in that provided on each fork 
spike is an introduction slot (16) open at the edge. 
A crank mechanism as claimed in at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that provided on the end of the tongue (8) 

facing the wiper shaft is a cambered supporting member (28) 
inwardly supportable on a housing lid of the driving 

assembly.  
 
A crank mechanism as claimed in at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that provided on the end (29) of the tongue 

(8) facing away from the lever is a bearing pin (31) 
protruding in a direction transverse to the plane of movement 

of the tongue for engagement with a bearing bore on the 
toothed gear wheel, preferably a worm gear wheel (4). 
A crank mechanism as claimed in at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that the lever (10) and the tongue (8) are 

made of plastic material, in particular, by injection 

moulding.
