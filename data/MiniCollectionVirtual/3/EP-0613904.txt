<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polypeptide having potent 
smooth muscle relaxing activity with excellent stability and 
long duration and to use of the same. The polypeptide of the 
present invention is useful as an active ingredient of drugs, 
particularly for prevention and treatment of asthma. Among a number of polypeptides having smooth muscle 
relaxing activity which have been so far discovered, 
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (hereinafter abbreviated as 
VIP) is a peptide hormone composed of 28 amino acid residues 
which was isolated from a side fraction in the course of 
extraction and purification of secretin from the porcine 
duodenum in 1970 (see S.I. Said and V. Mutt, Eur. J. 
Biochem., vol. 28, pp. 199-204 (1972)). The amino acid 
sequence of VIP was elucidated in 1974 (see V. Mutt and S.I. 
Said, Eur. J. Biochem., vol. 42, pp. 581-589 (1974)), and 
because of its structural similarity to secretin, glucagon, 
etc. VIP has been recognized as a peptide hormone belonging 
to the glucagon-secretin family. VIP occurs widely in the nervous system as well as in 
the gastrointestinal tract and exhibits a variety of 
biological activities, such as potent vasodilator activity, 
hypotensive activity, smooth muscle relaxing activity, 
intestinal juice secretion accelerating activity, pancreatic  
 
juice and bile secretion accelerating activity, gastric juice 
secretion inhibitory activity, glycogenolysis activity, 
various pituitary hormones secretion accelerating activity, 
blood flow regulating activity on the genital organs, 
bronchodilator activity, and so forth. Of these various activities of VIP, smooth muscle 
relaxing activity on the bronchus and the trabeculae of the 
corpus cavernosum penis is attracting particular attention 
with the expectation of application to the treatment of 
bronchial asthma or impotence. Production of VIP either by extraction and 
purification from animal organs or through chemical synthesis 
is accompanied by problems of stable supply, production 
efficiency, purity, production cost, and the like. Further, 
VIP is physicochemically labile and also tends to be degraded 
by enzymes present in the living body. It has therefore been 
considered difficult to put VIP alone to practical use as a 
drug. In order to overcome these problems, active study has 
been directed to development of VIP analogues having 
biological activities equal to or higher than VIP or having 
higher stability than VIP and processes for chemically 
synthesizing such analogues. The chemical
