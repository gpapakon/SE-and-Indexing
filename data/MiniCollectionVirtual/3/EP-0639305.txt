<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a rotor position 
detecting apparatus for a brushless motor, and particularly to 
a rotor position detecting apparatus for a compressor which is 
embodied by a brushless motor. In a refrigerator, an air conditioner or similar 
appliance, a compressor, which is used for changing the state 
of a fluid, for example refrigerant, is generally embodied by 
an A.C. induction motor. Furthermore, the compressor used in 
the appliance is tightly closed with housings welded together 
in order to prevent a decrease in the pressure therein. Within 
the housing, a motor is connected to a piston (in a 
reciprocating compressor). A connector, which is mounted in the 
body of the housing, has several terminals electrically 
connected to each of the phase windings of the motor. When the 
phase voltages are applied to the terminals, the axis of the 
motor starts to rotate, thereby causing the piston connected 
to the axis to reciprocate within a cylinder. In the manner 
described above, refrigerant is drawn into the cylinder and is 
then compressed. The closed compressor is required to normally 
operate under the temperature condition of a maximum 130Â°C and 
several tens of Psi, and to endure oil and refrigerant.  
 Compared with an A.C. motor, a brushless motor has a low 
noise level and low power consumption, and may be operated at 
continuously varying rotating rate. Considering the 
advantages, a closed compressor embodied by a brushless motor 
has been continuously developed. The brushless motor is 
activated by D.C. currents, out of phase from each other, 
flowing into each of the phase windings. Accordingly, a means 
for detecting the polarity of the rotor is essential to the 
brushless motor. A pair of light emitting and receiving 
elements are typically used for detecting the polarity of the 
rotor. However, there is a problem in that it is impossible to 
place the elements in the housing of the closed compressor, 
which operates under the condition of high temperature and high 
pressure, because the elements are normally made of 
semiconducting material. Furthermore, there is another problem 
in that the compressor seal is easily damaged because the 
signal wires of the elements are drawn out of the housing. 
Considering these problems, there has been developed a system 
using a winding induced voltage, instead of detecting by the 
elements. However, the system has a problem in that a means for 
detecting the winding induced voltage, a filter means and a 
means for starting
