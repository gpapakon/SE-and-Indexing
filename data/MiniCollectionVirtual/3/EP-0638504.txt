<ABSTRACT>
A modularly combined rubber sheet cooling device, which, 
after the mixing process, takes the warm plastic rubber 

mass in an almost continuous wide band from the mixing 
roller, leads it through a fluid bath which is provided 

with an anti-sticking means, then, by means of a forced 
air cooling, delivers a dried, cooled and no longer sticky 

band of rubber and which, by means of a forward and backward 
movement of the conveyor belt (1) and detainers, delivers 

an upright stack of rubber or delivers, optionally, cut-to-size, 
dried, cooled, no longer sticky rubber plates in 

upright stacks, the cutting device (11) and the stacking device 
being preferably mechanically separated from each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for stacking a sheet of 
rubber comprising a cutting device for cutting the rubber 
sheet, said stacking device containing a conveyor belt 
with frame for the rubber sheet, the conveyor belt with 
frame being movable backwards and forwards. Such a device is known from WO-90/12749. Generally a device for stacking a sheet of rubber is 
frequently found in the rubber processing industry. At the 
end of the mixing process which takes place in often large 
mixers in which rubber polymers, filling materials and ten 
or so different chemicals are kneaded and mixed, just 
mixed or newly-made rubber mixtures are formed in such a 
device into a rubber sheet with the help of high-speed 
rotors, the mixtures leaving the mixer under high pressure 
and high temperatures as an unmanageable, formless, hot, 
plastic rubber mass. For a long time now the formless mass has been formed by 
rolling the latter by means of a rolling device, as a 
result of which a wide band is formed, characterized by a 
standard width, thickness and temperature and which is 
still very sticky. The device which is also known under 
the name of "batch-off" device is also used for reducing 
the high delivery temperature of 120° to 150° C to a 
manageable temperature of 25° to 40° C and for applying an 
anti-sticking means to the surface of the rolled rubber 
sheet. At the end of the cooling path where the rubber sheet 
reaches a much lower temperature of 25° to 40° C and is no 
longer sticky, the rubber sheet can be delivered by means 
of a stacking device to stacking frames or lifting platforms,  
 
the rubber sheet on the stack having one initial 
end and one far end suitable for further processing on 
calenders, spraying machine and other devices. In the rubber processing industry which is directed 
towards making so-called technical rubber articles, the 
continuous band of rubber, which is supplied by the rubber 
sheet cooling device is cut into easily handled rubber 
plates in order to simplify further processing by a separate 
cutting device for the rubber sheet. The apparatus known from WO-90/12749 can in an economical 
way stack continuous bands of rubber in a zigzag folded 
condition as well as rubber plates. This apparatus comprises 
a skid, an endless supply belt having an upper run 
and a discharge end adjacent the skid and an endless 
transport belt below the supply belt wherein the transport 
belt is horizontally reciprocable with respect to the 
skid. A web is supplied by the supply belt to the
