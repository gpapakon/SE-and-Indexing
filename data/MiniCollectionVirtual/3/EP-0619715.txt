<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates 
generally to kettle-type barbecue grills and, 
more particularly, to ash catchers that can be 
attached to such grills.  
 Kettle-type grills are very widely 
used today. Presently, one of the most 
popular grills is being marketed by the 
Assignee of the present invention. This 
barbecue kettle consists of a generally semi-hemispherical 
bottom bowl that has a circular 
open top with a cooking grid slightly below 
the upper rim of the bowl. A generally semi-hemispherical 
top cover can be placed on the 
bottom bowl. Also, the bowl is supported on a 
tripod leg arrangement. This kettle 
configuration is a registered trademark of the 
Assignee of the present invention. Barbecue kettles that are designed 
for burning charcoal as a fuel also have a 
second grid for supporting the charcoal below 
the cooking surface. Both the bowl and cover 
have vent openings to provide the necessary 
oxygen for combustion of the charcoal while 
the cover is closed. One type of barbecue kettle that has 
received very favorable acceptance by 
consumers is disclosed in U.S. Reissue Patent 
No. 33,091, owned by the Assignee of the 
present invention, which is sold under the 
trademark ONE-TOUCHÂ®. During operation, the charcoal on 
the second grid burns, turns to ash, and falls  
 
to the bottom of the bowl. Also, grease or 
cooking fat, pieces of the food being cooked, 
chunks of hot coal and other things might fall 
to the bottom of the bowl. Openings are 
commonly located at the bottom of the bowl to 
let this material exit. A successful 
apparatus for scraping and disposing of this 
ash and debris from the bottom of the kettle 
and for controlling the air intake into the 
bottom of the kettle is disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,416,248, also owned by the 
Assignee of the present invention. US-A-4763640 relates to an ash catcher 
removably mountable below a barbecue kettle 
wherein a guide is provided for ashes 
discharged from an ash discharger opening in 
the kettle. US-A-4374489 relates to a device 
removably attachable to the underside of a 
cooking grill including a smoking column 
which generates smoke to flavour food being 
grilled. It is an accepted practice to have a 
small curved plate or bowl spaced below the 
bottom of the kettle to catch the ash and 
debris that falls through the openings in the 
bottom. However, if there is any breeze or if 
the kettle is nudged or moved, it is possible 
for some ash and debris to not fall onto the 
plate or to fall out of the plate. This can 
pose
</DESCRIPTION>
