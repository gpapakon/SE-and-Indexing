<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plastic film improved
in its antistatic property so as to be less affected by the
change of humidity. It can be used for a magnetic tape, a
floppy disk, a flexible board, a substrate for a membrane
switch and a recording sheet for a printer. Since a film
transparent sufficiently can be made, it can be used for an
OHP film, a liquid crystal display apparatus, a touch panel
and a stained glass. In addition, it can also be used for a
photographic light-sensitive material because the excellent
degree of clearness of the plastic film does not adversely
affect the photographic characteristics of the photographic
light-sensitive material. Because of commonly strong static charge build-up,
plastic films have been hitherto often limited in their use
other than the use taking advantage of such properties. For
example, light-sensitive photographic materials commonly make
use of plastic film as a support having electrical insulation
properties. Such materials belong to what is called composite
materials, comprised of a support and a light-sensitive
photographic material layer. Hence the light-sensitive
photographic materials tend to be statically charged when,
during their manufacture and use, they come into contact with
the surface of a material of the same or different kind or
they are separated therefrom. Most static charges accumulated
as a result of static charging cause various difficulties. The
most important difficulty is what is called static marks,
which are spots or branch-type or feather-type lines occurring
during the photographic processing of the light sensitive
photographic materials whose light-sensitive silver halide
emulsion layers have been sensitized as a result of the
discharge of static electricity accumulated before the
photographic processing. When, for example, this phenomenon
occurs in medical or industrial X-ray films, it leads to a
very dangerous determination. This phenomenon becomes known
only when the photographic films have been processed, and is
one of very difficult problems. These accumulated static
charges may also cause troubles such that dust adheres to a 
plastic film surface and no uniform coating on the film
surface can be carried out.Such troubles caused by static charging may also occur in
many cases besides the foregoing. For example, in the course
of manufacture, the troubles may be caused by contact friction
between photographic films and rollers and by separation of
emulsion sides from support sides in the course of winding-up
or
