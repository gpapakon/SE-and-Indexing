<ABSTRACT>
Door frames, window frames, baseboards, corner mouldings, etc. are trimmed with solid wood, e.g. oak, trim pieces (34). The trim pieces are fitted over splines (32) which are screwed to the wall. A jig enables the splines to be located accurately in position. The spline includes no beads, snaps, or other features that would require the oak trim section to flex; instead, the trim is secured by the friction arising from the fit of the spline into a groove (60) cut into the rear face of the trim section. In a variation, a pair of parallel grooves are provided, together with a corresponding pair of splines, which are mounted on a web.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wood trim, of the kind used to trim the edges of door frames and window frames, 
wainscotting, and also baseboards and skirting boards, in houses and other buildings. In the conventional manner of applying such trim, for instance around a door frame in a house, the carpenter 
cuts the lengths of trim, mitres the corners, and then nails the lengths of trim in place; then he drives the nail heads 
below the surface of the trim; he applies filler or stopper into the indentations; and leaves the filler to set. He returns 
later, and smooths down the filler. After that he applies stain, varnish, etc as required. A good deal of care and attention is required of the carpenter when fitting conventional door trim. The door 
trim is very visible and noticeable, and if the job is done casually or carelessly the results can be most displeasing to 
the householder. One problem with conventional trim is that finishing coatings cannot be applied to the trim until after the trim 
has been nailed up, and the nail-holes have been filled and smoothed. Especially when the trim is being applied to a 
new house the atmosphere is likely to be dusty, and dust can spoil the quality of the finish. Only a conscientious 
carpenter, working with a great care and attention, can be left with the job of applying and finishing the trim, especially 
if the trim is of the kind in which the decorative grain of the wood is to be displayed. If the trim is to be painted, rather than left with the natural grain visible, the amount of attention needed to fill 
the nail holes, etc can be reduced. Consequently, it has been unusual for builders to provide wood trim in which the 
natural grain is left showing: the builder has far rather preferred to cover the trim over with paint, since the quality of 
craftsmanship needed to do that is rather lower. The invention is aimed at providing a means for attaching wood-trim around a door frame, etc, which is far 
simpler for the carpenter than the above, and in which nothing (such as nail heads) mars the presentation-surface of 
the trim. It is an aim of the invention that the trim may be pre-finished, in-factory if desired, and applied to the wall 
in its finished form. The invention provides a wood trim assembly, which is suitable for attaching solid wood door and window trim, 
wainscotting, baseboard trim, or the like to a wall as claimed in claim 1. The assembly includes lengths of solid wood trim, and lengths of 
spline. Each length of wood trim is of constant cross-section

the trim being assembled to the spline; 
the fit of the spline (32) to the groove (60) in the trim (36) is such that, 
upon assembly of the trim to the spline, the spline being 

fixed firmly to the wall, the trim is assemblable over 
the spline by means of a manual pounding action, whereby  

 
the trim, after assembly, remains firmly held in place by 

means of its frictional grip on the spline, and whereby 
the use of nails or glue to hold the trim is avoided; 
the spline (32) is formed with a pair of opposed, outwardly-facing, 
side surfaces; 
the groove (60) is formed with a complementary pair of opposed, 
inwardly-facing, side surfaces; 
the spline (32) is formed with a top surface (62), being a surface of 
the spline which lies between the side surfaces, and 

which, when the spline is fixed to the wall, faces away 
from the wall; 
the groove (60) is formed with a bottom surface, being a surface of 
the groove which lies between the side surfaces of the 

groove, 
the groove (60) and spline (32) are so dimensioned and arranged that, 
upon assembly of the groove to the spline, the side 

surfaces of the spline fit together, and lie in close 
operational gripping engagement with the side surfaces of 

the groove; 
the groove (60) and spline (32) are so dimensioned and arranged that, 
upon assembly of the groove to the spline, the top 

surface (62) of the spline and the bottom surface of the 
groove lie substantially clear of each other; 
 
the form of the spline (32) and of the groove (60) in the trim are such 

that, when the spline is fixed to the wall, and the trim 
is assembled on the spline, the said opposed side 

surfaces of the groove and of the trim lie at a 
substantial angle with respect to the plane of the wall. 
Assembly of claim 1, wherein the fit of the groove (60) to 
the spline (32), after assembly, across the width of the 

groove, is between zero clearance and 1/4 mm clearance. 
Assembly of claim 1, wherein the cross-sectional 
shape of the trim (36), with the groove (60) therein, is 

characterised as chunky and rigid. 
Assembly of claim 1, wherein the spline (32) is a plastic 
extrusion, and the cross-sectional shape of the spline 

includes resilient fingers which, upon assembly of the 
trim to the spline, engage, and press resiliently 

against, the sides of the groove. 
Wood trim kit, comprising a combination of the 
assembly of claim 1, together with a jig (40), the jig being 

suitable for assisting in the placement of the spline (32) in 
the desired location upon the wall, wherein: 


the jig (40) includes a spline holder (43), in which is formed a jig-groove 
(47), the jig-groove being complementary in cross-sectional 

size and shape to the spline; 
the jig (40) is provided with through-holes, which are so 
positioned and arranged that screws can pass therethrough 

and through a spline positioned in the jig-groove, the 
through-holes being large enough that the heads of the 

screws can pass therethrough. 
Assembly of claim 1, wherein:  
 


the assembly includes a pair of the said grooves (82,83) and a 
complementary pair of the said spline (78,79), the splines and 

grooves being arranged in spaced-apart, parallel, side-by-side 
relationship; 
and the splines are linked by a web means (80), which is effective 
to hold the splines precisely in the said relationship. 
Assembly of claim 1, wherein the shape of the crosssection 
of the solid wood trim includes a cut-out (87) which 

is suitable for receiving electrical wiring passing along 
the length of the trim. 
Assembly of claim 1, wherein the groove (60) and the 
spline (32) are plain-sided, in that the sides of the grooves 

and splines include no protrusions or beads or re-entrant 
aspects, and in that the fit of the trim to the spline is 

such that the wood of the trim is not, in substance, 
required to flex resiliently, upon engagement. 
Assembly of claim 1, wherein the distance apart of the 
side surfaces of the spline (32) is, in substance, not more 

than the distance apart of the side surfaces of the 
groove (60), whereby the fit of the spline to the groove, when 

assembled, at a particular cross-sectional location 
thereof, is not an interference fit.

side surfaces; 
the groove (60) is formed with a complementary pair of opposed, 
inwardly-facing, side surfaces;
