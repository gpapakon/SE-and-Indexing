<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling a circuit simulator for examining the 
electromagnetic behaviour of an electrical conductor pattern is based on reducing the 

equivalent circuit model of the pattern. The pattern is first represented by a collection of 
geometrical elements, whose size is determined by the scale of the geometrical details 

that is well below the minimum wavelength contemplated. Selection of a set of those 
elements that lie approximately at a distance of one wavelength from one another and 

expressing the field values of the non-selected elements in terms of the field values for 
the selected elements permits correlating a low rank admittance matrix and the matrices 

of the Maxwell equations. Typically, an effective reduction of four orders of magnitude 
in the number of equivalent circuit components is obtained without losing model 

accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of controlling a circuit simulator used for
simulating an electromagnetic behaviour of an electrically conductive pattern that is provided
with input terminals for receiving input signals and output terminals for supplying output
signals, the method comprising the steps of:
creating a geometric model of a surface of the pattern, the geometric model including a
collection of contiguous geometrical elements;forming a respective set of matrix equations, representing Maxwell's equations and involving
field values associated with each respective one of the geometrical elements;associating values of matrix coefficients in the equations to further coefficients of an
admittance matrix representative of an equivalent circuit model for the pattern;operating on the equivalent circuit model by the simulator.Computer supported circuit simulation has become an indispensable tool in
electronic circuitry design to save on time and costs. An aspect of circuitry behaviour that can
be modeled is related to electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). EMC is concerned with the
circuit's susceptibility to irradiation, crosstalk and emission of radiation. A device is
susceptible to irradiation when an incoming electromagnetic field induces currents in the
circuit's conductors. Crosstalk occurs when a current in a particular conductor of the circuit
gives rise to an inductively or capacitively induced current in another conductor of the circuit.
Emission of electromagnetic radiation takes place when a current in a conductive portion of
the circuit produces an electromagnetic field that may be picked up by another circuit or
system.In the design of electronic systems, the electromagnetic field concept is
replaced by an electric circuit concept. This implies that the electromagnetic field in the
electronic system is locally specified in terms of currents and voltages that comply with
Kirchhoff's laws. These currents and voltages can be thought of as originating in a
dynamically equivalent circuit made up of lumped components such as resistors, capacitors
and inductances. Such an equivalent circuit model is created below for a conductor pattern.
The actual pattern of conductors of e.g., printed circuit boards (PCBs), antennae, ICs, multichip
modules (MCMs), leadframes, etc, is translated into a model of virtual equivalent
electrical circuit in terms of virtual parts (resistors, capacitors, inductances and voltage
sources) that are interconnected via nodes. This equivalent model is thereupon supplied to
