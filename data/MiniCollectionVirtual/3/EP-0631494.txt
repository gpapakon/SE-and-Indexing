 DESCRIPTION DEVICE FOR ASSISTING CHILDBIRTHTECHNICAL FIELDField of the Invention. This invention relates in general to obstetric devices, and more particular to devices useful in removing the baby during vaginal deliv¬ ery. BACKGROUND ARTToday's state of the art obstetrics utilizes various procedures to assist in instances of difficult vaginal deliveries. These procedures basically fall into three categories: version, Caesarian and forceps assisted deliv¬ ery. In the case of severe cephalo-pelvic disproportion, placenta previa, vaso previa, and other contraindications to vaginal delivery, the "C-Section", whether classic or low transverse, remains the mainstay procedure. However, it has long been recognized that to the extent that C- Section deliveries can be successfully avoided, statistical maternal and fetal benefits will be realized. Even the non-difficult vaginal delivery can benefit from non-trau¬ matic assists.Many problems may develop during delivery which require assistance from the attending obstetrician to successfully remove the baby from the birth canal. One such problem results from the presenting part of the baby, usually its head, descending too slowly. This is particu¬ larly true in the case of the pri igravida mother. Even with a completely dilated and effaced cervix, and an adequate pelvis, a fetus might refuse to descend beyond station "+1", especially when the mother is suffering from contraction exhaustion. This can remain a problem even with an assist from administration of oxytocin (Pitoσin) . This problem is frequently exacerbated by anesthesia, particu¬ larly in the instance of epidural anesthesia which fre- quently produces induced non-beneficial partial atony of the engaged and dedicated muscles. Such partial atony frequently results in non-beneficial, and sometimes hazard- 

ous, prolongation of labor. Station "+l" is considered idpelvis and in the usual case is considered too high for a forceps assisted delivery. The risks to the fetus with forceps application at this level are extreme. Forceps cannot be safely used until the presenting part is at least at station "+211, and preferably between stations "+2" and "+3" which is the floor of the perineum.Modern obstetrics has not developed an alternative to the use of forceps when an assisted natural delivery is indicated, such as when the fetus is consistently exhibit¬ ing late decelerations of heartbeat following contractions or is exhibiting nonvariability of the baseline heartbeat rate. Obstetrical forceps are typically,

CLAIMS I Claim:
1. An apparatus for assisting delivery of a fetus, comprising: an elongated member having a tubular passageway formed therethrough, said member having a first end and a second end; collar means, connected to the first end of said elongated member, for encircling the neck of the fetus so that the first end of said elongated member surrounds the fetus' head; and insertion means for inserting said collar means over the fetal head and wherein said insertion means includes at least one elongated member which is capable of transmitting a force.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said collar means further comprises: pocket means for receiving said insertion means and transmitting the force of said insertion means to said collar.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said elongated member of said insertion means comprises: a first member; and a second member overlaying said first member and cooperating with said first member so that said second member can be extended relative to said first member.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein said.first member contains graduation means for determining the relative movement of said first member relative to said second member; and said second member comprises a first end and a second end, wherein said first end has a tapered surface and said second end has a projection formed thereon. 5. The apparatus of claim 2, further comprising: an access ring connected to the second end of said elongated member. 


 6. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said insertion means includes: a flexible member, said flexible member having defined thereon graduations so that the relative movement of said flexible member can be determined.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein said flexible member is constructed of plastic.
8. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said insertion means is a plurality of flexible wands, each of said wands having a first end and a second end.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein said wands comprise: a first member; and a second member overlaying said first member and cooperating with said first member so that said second member can be extended relative to said first member.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, further comprising: handle means for holding said wands at the first end of said wands, and wherein said handle means includes a tubular structure with a plurality of slots to receive said first ends of said wands.
11. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein said insertion means comprises a one-piece die cut insertion wand, and wherein said one-piece die cut insertion wand is folded so that said folded wand forms a tubular member which sur¬ rounds said collar means.
12. A method of assisting the delivery of an infant during birth, the method comprising the steps of: a) positioning an apparatus over the fetal skull, said apparatus including: an elongated member having a first and second end; collar means, connected to the first end of said elongated member, for encircling the fetal neck so that the first end of said elongated member surrounds the infant's head and wherein said collar means contains a plurality of openings; and, at least one insertion member placed within said openings; b) guiding said collar means over the fetal head 


by applying force to said insertion member until said collar means is posterior to the infant's head; c) adjusting said collar means so that said collar means fits loosely about the fetal neck, but is restricted so as not to easily slip over the fetal head; d) pulling said device at said second end so that said collar means exerts an equalized and evenly distribut¬ ed resistance to pulling sufficient to initiate axial gripping by said device of the fetal head; and e) delivering the child by vaginal birth.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the step of adjust¬ ing said collar includes the steps of: manipulating said insertion means until the correct position is obtained; and removing said insertion means.
14. The method of claim 13 wherein said insertion member includes: a first and second portion having a first end and a second end, the second end having a shoulder engaged in the pocket, and wherein said first and second member are overlaid so that said first and second portion may be telescoped relative to the other, and wherein the step of removing said insertion means includes the steps of: pushing on the first portion while holding onto the second portion so that the shoulder becomes disengaged with the pocket; and withdrawing the first portion and second portion from said apparatus.
