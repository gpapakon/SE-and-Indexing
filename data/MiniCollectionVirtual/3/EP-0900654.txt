<ABSTRACT>
In the present invention, the thermal efficiency
and concentration of a thermal head (5) on a transfer

film (2) over the surface of a transfer drum (9) are
improved, thereby improving the reproducibility of

gradation in printing, which enables highly minute
transfer images to be printed on the transfer film (2).

This makes it possible to form a highly minute image on
an image-transferred member (12). To do this, a

cushion layer (9d) made of elastomer and a rigid layer
(9e) with a surface finish (Rz) of less than 2.0 µm on

a surface of the cushion layer (9d) are provided on a
surface of the drum base (9c) of the transfer drum (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for forming transfer images in which an image
printed by a thermal head and an ink ribbon on a image-reception
layer formed on a transfer film in contact
with the surface of a transfer drum is transferred
together with the image-reception layer by the heating
and pressurizing of the heat roller to an image-transferred
member to form an image and to a transfer
drum used in the apparatus, and more particularly to a
transfer image forming method and apparatus capable of
improving the thermal efficiency of a thermal head for
a transfer film over the surface of the transfer drum
and the reproducibility of gradation in printing and to
a transfer drum used in the apparatus.In general, a transfer image forming apparatus is
an image forming apparatus that forms an image using
dye or pigment as coloring material on an image-transferred
member through a heating process or a
heating and pressurizing process. Among such image
forming apparatuses, one is based on an indirect
transferring method in which an image using dye or
pigment as coloring material is temporarily formed by
causing the thermal head to thermally transfer the ink
layer of an ink ribbon on the image-reception layer
formed in a peelable manner on the transfer film
serving as an intermediate recording medium, and 
thereafter the transfer film is heated and pressed
against the image-transferred member with the heat
roller so that the transfer image formed on the image-reception
layer may be transferred together with the
image-reception layer to the image-transferred member.In one transfer image forming apparatus of this
type, a buffer mechanism for removing the difference
between the distance in the direction of the
circumference of the rotating heat roller and the
moving distance of the image-transferred member has
been provided in a transfer mechanism, as in the
transfer image forming apparatus disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application No. 6-318003.In another transfer image forming apparatus, there
has been provided a burr removing mechanism that
removes burrs in such a manner that burrs or foil
fringes are prevented from appearing outside the image-reception
layer on the image-transferred member when
the image-reception layer on the transfer film is
peeled and transferred from the substrate layer to the
image-transferred member in transferring the image-reception
layer on which the transfer image of the
transfer film has been printed to the image-transferred
member by heating and pressurization.
