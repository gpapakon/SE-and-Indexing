<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing a desired 
substance by culturing a transformant in a medium until the desired 

substance is accumulated in the culture and then recovering the 
desired substance, said transformant being obtained by transforming an 

acetic acid-resistant microorganism of the genus 
Escherichia
 with a 
recombinant plasmid carrying a gene involved in production of the 

desired substance. The present process enables cells to be cultured 
easily at high density while the desired substance can be efficiently 

produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention replates to a process for
efficiently producing a desired substance.In the case of the production of a desired substance
by E. coli, the culture of cells at high density is a
useful means from the standpoint of the effective running
of a fermentor and the efficient recovery of a product,
as well as for an improvement in the yield of the
product. In the case of E.coli, however, high-density
culture has been difficult because the growth of the
cells is inhibited in a medium with significant
accumulation of acetic acid resulting from the metabolism
of nutrient substances.To solve this problem, there are known a dialysis
culture method [Journal of General Microbiology, 103, 345
(1977)] and a membrane cell recycle culture method
[Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 36, 330 (1990)] of
removing acetic acid from a culture system by dialysis or
filtration of a liquid medium. Reports have also been
made of a culture method of decreasing the formation of
acetic acid by the supply of pure oxygen for maintaining
a high concentration of dissolved oxygen in a liquid
medium [Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, 53, 2115
(1989)] and a method of decreasing the accumulation of
acetic acid by maintaining glucose at a low concentration
in a liquid medium [Journal of Fermentation and
Bioengineering, 74, 196 (1992)]. However, these methods
cannot be said industrially advantageous because of the
need for a special apparatus and the problem of complex
maintenance and control of such apparatus.Although a report has been made of a method for
decreasing the ability of a microorganism to produce
acetic acid by conferring sodium fluoroacetate resistance
on the microorganism so that the enzyme activities in the 
pathway of acetic acid biosynthesis are lowered or
deleted (Japanese Patent Publication No. 502065/90,
European Patent Publication No. 316229), there exist
disadvantages such as accumulation of pyruvic acid and
lactic acid [Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 38, 1318
(1991)].Some microorganisms belonging to the genera
Acetobacter and Gluconobacter are known to be acetic
acid-resistant [J. Bacteriology, 172, 2096-2104 (1990)].
Reports have also been made about acetic acid-resistant
microorganisms belonging to the genus Escherichia
[Applied Biochem. Biotechnol., 34/35, 185-204 (1992);
Applied Biochem. Biotechnol., 39/40, 667-685 (1993)].
However, these reported microorganisms have obtained
their resistance through transformation, not by nature.
None of these reports disclose the use of acetic
