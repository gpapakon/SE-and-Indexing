<ABSTRACT>
A low-power transmitter (1) is responsive to a command from 
a base station to power-amplify and output transmission signals. 

If the commanded power level is high to be realized solely by the 
low-power transmitter, the output of the low-power transmitter 

(1) is boosted by a booster (2). The booster (2) executes a boost 
such that the power level and waveform of the transmission signals 

will be coincident with or substantially coincident with the 
level and waveform of a given reference burst wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a booster and method for 
boosting the output of a low-power burst transmitter and also to 
a burst transmission apparatus using such a booster. When using a low-power transmitter, it is preferred to 
provide a booster on the output side of the transmitter. More 
particularly, a low-power transmitter having its output insufficient 
to provide the required output must be boosted up to that 
required output. If the low-power transmitter is of a continuous 
transmission type, its transmission output may be boosted according 
to such a principle as described in U.S.S.N.07/455156 filed 
on December 22, 1989 or Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 3-76430. Fig. 6A shows a continuous transmission apparatus comprising 
a low-power transmitter 100 and a booster 200 connected to the 
later part of the transmitter. The low-power transmitter 100 
comprises a power amplifier (PA) 110, an automatic power controller 
(APC) 120 and a control circuit 130. The booster 200 comprises 
a PA 210 and an APC 220. The PA 110 of the low-power transmitter 100 receives a 
transmission signal through a transmission signal input terminal 
100a and then power-amplifies the transmission signal. The amplified  
 
transmission signal is outputted from an antenna connection 
terminal 140. If the use of the booster 200 is not required, that 
is, if the output transmission level of the low-power transmitter 
100 satisfies the required level, the antenna connection terminal 
140 is connected to an antenna to transmit the output of the PA 
110 out of the antenna. However, if there is a possibility potential 
of not satisfy the required transmission output level in the 
low-power transmitter 100, the antenna connection terminal 140 is 
then connected to a transmission signal input terminal 250 of the 
booster 200 as shown. In such a connection, a transmission signal 
outputted from the antenna connection terminal 140 is received by 
the PA 210 of the booster 200 through the transmission signal 
input terminal 250. The PA 210 then power-amplifies this transmission 
signal. The amplified transmission signal is fed from an 
antenna connection terminal 270 to an antenna (not shown). The power amplification of the PA 110 or 210 is controlled 
directly by the APC 120 or 220. More particularly, each of the 
APC 120 or 220 is adapted to sense the output power level of the 
corresponding PA 110 or 210 to feedback control the amplification 
factor of the PA 110 or 210 on the sensed level. Thus, the output 
power level of
