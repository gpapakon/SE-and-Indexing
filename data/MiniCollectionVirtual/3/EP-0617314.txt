<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical circuit 
system (for example, an optical circuit, optical LSI, 
optical circuit substrate, backplane optical circuit) 
which can produce an optical signal for propagation along 
an optical circuit composed mainly of an optical 
waveguide and optical fiber, more particularly which can 
produce an optical signal with a small fluctuation in 
intensity by a plurality of electrical elements without 
the use of separate electro-optic conversion elements and 
to components of the same (for example, optical tabs, 
optical switches, optical couplers, waveguide optical 
amplifiers, waveguide optical lasers, and optical 
couplers). The optical circuit system and components according 
to the present invention are suitable for use in optical 
information fields such as optical communications and 
optical interconnection. Optical circuits, as is well known in the art, play 
an important role in various optical information 
processing systems such as optical exchanges in optical 
communication. We have proposed various systems regarding 
optical circuits for optical interconnections wherein we 
form optical circuits by coupling IC's, multichip 
modules, boards, etc. by optical waveguides in optical 
circuits using optical waveguides and optical fibers and 
transmit signals over the same. According to these 
proposals, the optical circuit is primarily formed by 
optical waveguides. In an optical circuit comprised 
primarily of optical waveguides, however, there is the 
problem of attenuation of the intensity of the signal 
light along with the propagation and transmission of 
light.  Further, proposals have been made of various systems 
for generating optical signals from electrical signals. 
For example, proposal has been made of the method of 
guiding non-signal light generated at a light source 
through an optical waveguide and generating signal light 
having intensity modulation by a voltage-controlled type 
optical branching filter formed by an electro-optic 
material etc. In these methods, however, when generating 
a plurality of signal lights from a single waveguide, 
there is the problem of a difficulty in obtaining signal 
light with a fixed intensity. On the other hand, as an element for amplifying the 
attenuating signal light, in the field of optical 
communications, study has been made of optical 
amplification fibers using optical fibers. While these 
are effective as elements for amplifying the signal light 
propagated through an optical fiber, there is the
