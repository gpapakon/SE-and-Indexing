An arrangement for refilling a container (1) consisting of the refillable 
container (1) for fluid products with a closeable product outlet opening (3) and 

a closeable refill opening (4) positioned preferably beneath the product outlet 
opening (3) with a first coupling element (8) fixedly arranged therein and 

further consisting of a refill pack (2) with a second coupling element (16) - 
designed for adaptor-like connection to the first coupling element (8) - at its 

outlet opening (15) and an assembly (13,21,26) for opening the outlet 
opening (17) of the refill pack (2) closed before the refilling process during 

insertion of the second coupling element (16) into the first coupling element 
(8), characterized in that, as the assembly (13,21,26) for opening the outlet 

opening (17) of the second coupling element (16) closed before the refilling 
process enters the outlet opening (17), the tubular second coupling element 

(16) is designed to penetrate into the tubular first coupling element (8) with 
formation of a ventilation gap (31) between the outer wall of the second 

coupling element (16) and the inner wall of the first coupling element (8) and 
in that a dispenser is fixedly integrated in the product outlet opening (3). 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
assembly is in the form of a spike (13,26) arranged inside the tubular first 

coupling element (8) and the outlet opening (17) at the second coupling 
element (16) is closed by a foil, a sealing disc (27) or the like before the 

refilling process. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
assembly is in the form of a punch (21) projecting from the tubular first 

coupling element (8) which is designed for insertion into the tubular second 
coupling element (16), a closure plug (25) adapted for insertion into the refill 

pack (2) by pressure being sealingly inserted into the second coupling 
element (16). 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that the second 
coupling element (16) consists of a first tubular section (22) arranged on the  

 
refill pack (2), a tapered transition section (23) and a second tubular section 

(24) of relatively small diameter, the closure plug (25) being in the form of a 
ball with a diameter substantially corresponding to the relatively small 

diameter of the second tubular section (24). 
An arrangement as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first coupling element (8) is in the form of an adaptor 

provided around its outer periphery with detent elements (11) which cooperate 
with corresponding detent elements (12) at the refill opening (4). 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the 
adaptor is formed by a slightly downwardly tapering tube with additional 

lateral outlet openings (10). 
An arrangement as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first and second coupling elements (8,16) are 

provided inside and outside with corresponding detent means (14,18).
