<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for maintaining
stability of sterile sodium hypochlorite solutions. Sodium
hypochlorite (NaOCl) is one of the essential ingredients used in the
preparation of Tc-99m labelled erythrocytes. For this application,
NaOCl is commonly prepared by dilution of reagent grade NaOCl (5.25%
W/V), with normal saline to achieve a concentration of 0.1%. It has
been observed that NaOCl solutions diluted in this manner are
relatively unstable, and as a precaution are prepared as close as
possible to the time of use.Studies have been conducted on the stability of bulk, non-sterile
sodium hypochlorite, most notably those of Fabian et al, Stability of
Sodium Hypochlorite, Am. J. Hosp. Pharm., 1982, 39:1016-17; and Morris
et al, The Stability of Diluted Hypochlorite Solution, Aust. J. Hosp.
Pharm.., 10(3):1016-117, 1980. These studies indicated that dilute
NaOCl solutions were somewhat stable for periods ranging from one to
two years. However, the data presented showed wide differences in the
degree of stability achieved for NaOCl, without any apparent reason
for the differing results.Many other studies have been carried out in attempts to prepare
stable NaOCl solutions by the inclusion of stabilizers or other
additives. In every case known, the addition of stabilizers or
additives resulted in even more rapid degradation of the NaOCl
solution.Therefore, there remains a need for a reliable and predictable
means to maintain the stability of NaOCl solutions over an extended
period of time.One object of the present invention is to provide a means for
preparing sterile solutions of dilute NaOCl and maintaining the
stability thereof for periods of at least one year. The system of the present invention is set forth in the Claims.This system is capable of maintaining the stability of NaOCl
solutions for periods of at least one year. In particular, the present
invention provides a system which
avoids the addition of all chemical additives, and
carefully controls pH and exposure to light.An initial study was carried out in order to determine the causes
for reduction in stability of NaOCl solutions. This study indicated
that the stability of NaOCl solutions is effected by the type of
container and closure used, concentration, storage temperature and
exposure to light.In particular, solutions containing 0.1% to 5.0% NaOCl in basic
normal saline were tested for stability. FIve different concentrations
of NaOCl were tested; 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0%. Each of the
five concentrations was
