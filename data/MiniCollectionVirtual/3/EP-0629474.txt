<ABSTRACT>
A spring tensioning apparatus for tensioning a helical spring 10 for all spring diameters, pitches and lengths, in particular of MacPherson strut units (telescopic legs), possesses a threaded spindle 4 between two guide bars 7, 8 for guiding a spring holder 2a, 2b which is lifted and lowered by the thread 4a of the rotating threaded spindle 4. For secure holding of the helical spring 10 in the spring holders 1a, 1b; 2a, 2b, the latter possess clamping claws 13, 14 with which the circumference of the helical spring 10 is embraced widely over at least 180 DEG  and which can be adjusted in accordance with the spring pitch 10b. The helical spring 10 is secured against jumping out of the tensioning apparatus by a safety chain 17 between the free ends of the spring holders 1a, 1b; 2a, 2b.

a base plate (3) on the one hand, and a top plate (5) on the other hand, two 
spring holders (1a, 1b; 2a, 2b) axially aligned with each other, and a screw 

spindle (4) arranged between the two guide rods (7, 8), by means of which the 
interspacing of the spring holders (1a, 1b; 2a, 2b) is adjustable with respect to 

each other, wherein at least one of the spring holders (2a, 2b) is carried for 
displacement on the guide rods (7, 8) by means of a guide plate (6), and the 

spring holders (1a, 1b; 2a, 2b) surround the circumference of the helical springs 
(10) inserted between them at least over 180Â°, and at least one of the spring 

holders (1a, 1b; 2a, 2b) adjusts to the spring lead (10b), 
characterized in that
