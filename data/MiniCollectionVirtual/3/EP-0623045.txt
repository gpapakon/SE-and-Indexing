<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved method and container (10) for filtering a body fluid. The method comprises the steps of isolating a volume of solution in a first chamber (14) of a container (10); collecting a body fluid in a second chamber (16); passing the body fluid through a filter; and rinsing the filter with an isolated volume of solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
collection and filtration of body fluids. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to the 
leukodepletion of red blood cells. In a variety of therapies, such as transfusion and 
transplants, body fluids, especially blood components, 
such as red blood cells, platelets, plasma, and bone 
marrow, are infused from one or more individuals into a 
patient. Three principal indications for the transfusion 
of a blood component exist: 1) deficiency in oxygen-carrying 
red blood cells; 2) deficiency in hematologic 
factors related to blood clotting, including platelets 
or protein coagulation factors; and 3) deficiency in 
plasma volume. Patients requiring a transfusion do not receive 
whole blood, but, rather receive the specific component 
required to overcome the clinical deficiency. For 
example, patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation 
therapy require primarily platelets and to a lesser 
degree red blood cells. Bone marrow or other organ 
transplant and dialysis patients generally require only 
red blood cells. Some blood components, such as leukocytes, are 
generally unwanted because they are not relevant to the 
therapeutic effects of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, 
platelets, or plasma. Leukocytes also have been 
implicated as increasing the risks associated with blood 
transfusions for their role in alloimmunization to HLA  
 
antigens and post transfusion infection by acting as 
virus carrying cells. Thus, a filtering process is used 
to remove leukocytes in approximately 10% of the 
transfused blood components, although this percent may 
increase in the future. This process is called 
leukodepletion. In collecting blood, commonly an anticoagulant is 
added to the whole blood collected from the donor. Whole 
blood can be separated into its components. The 
separated components can be placed in storage containers. 
For example, red blood cells are collected and stored in 
containers that include a storage solution such as AdsolÂ® 
available from Baxter Healthcare of Deerfield, Illinois. As previously stated, it may be desirable to remove 
the leukocytes from, for example, red cells before they 
are transfused. A typical leukodepletion filtering 
process comprises passing the blood component that is 
housed in a container through a filter designed to 
capture leukocytes without damaging the blood components. 
To improve recovery of the blood component, a storage 
solution is used to rinse any remaining blood components 
through the filter.

<CLAIMS>
A method for filtering a body fluid comprising the steps of: 

isolating a volume of rinse solution in a first chamber (14) of a 
container (10); 
collecting a body fluid in a second chamber (16) of the container 
(10); 
passing the body fluid from the second chamber (16) through a 

filter while the rinse solution remains isolated in the first chamber (14); 
and 
opening the first chamber (16) to the second chamber (14) and 
passing the rinse solution through the second chamber and the filter so as 

to rinse the filter. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein the container (10) is a clampable 
bag and external separating means is used to clamp the bag to isolate the 

rinse solution. 
The method of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the body fluid is a blood 
component. 
A method according to Claim 3, wherein the filter is a leukocyte 
filter. 
The method of Claim 4 wherein the blood component is red blood 
cells. 
The method of Claim 5 wherein the rinse solution is a red blood 
cell storage solution.  

 
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the bag (10) has an 
internal seal extending across a portion of the bag so as partially to define 

the first chamber (14). 
Apparatus for the leukofiltration of a blood component comprising: 

a container (10) for collecting a blood component to be filtered 
including first and second walls defining an interior therebetween, 

separating means (13) separating the container into first and second 
chambers (14,16), the first chamber (14) isolating a volume of rinse 

solution from the second chamber (16) containing a blood component and 
actuable to open the first chamber to the second container; and 
a leukocyte filter for filtering leukocytes from the blood component. 
The apparatus of Claim 8 wherein the container (10) is a bag and 
the separating means is a clamp. 
The apparatus of Claim 8 or 9 further including an internal seal 
extending across a portion of the container for partially defining said 

chambers (14,16).
