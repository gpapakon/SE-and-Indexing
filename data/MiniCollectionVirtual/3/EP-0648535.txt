<ABSTRACT>
A body made up of substantially continuous high 
strength substrate having open pores which have active 

material embedded therein. The body is made of material 
which can be ceramics, glass, glass-ceramic, cermet, 

metal, oxides, and combinations of these. The active 
material can be molecular sieve, activated carbon, and 

combinations these. A method for producing a pore-impregnated 
body which involves providing the substrate 

having the open pores, providing a slurry of active 
material dispersed in a medium, contacting the substrate 

with the slurry at subatmospheric pressure to 
substantially fill the open pores of the substrate with 

the active material, followed by drying.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing a body made up of
a continuous high strength porous substrate having active
material embedded in its pores.
The body is especially suited for use
as a device for use in catalyst and hydrocarbon adsorption
applications.The conventional ceramic monolithic catalyst consists
of a ceramic substrate with a coating of high surface area
material upon which a catalyst metal is deposited. In
particular, the ceramic substrate is normally prepared by
sintering a mold of clay or other ceramic material at a
high temperature to impart density and strength. This
procedure normally results in a very small surface area,
and consequently the ceramic must be coated with another
material having a higher surface area, as well as specific
chemical characteristics on which to actually deposit the
catalyst. This procedure of depositing a high surface area
"washcoat" on the low surface area ceramic wall is
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,742,437 and
3,824,196.Catalyst substrates of this kind suffer from several
disadvantages. In service, the substrates are exposed to a
flow of gases which often contain dusts or particulate
matter, which can cause the high surface area coating to
flake off the underlying ceramic substrate. This 
phenomenon can also occur where the substrate is exposed
to thermal cycling because the washcoat and the underlying
ceramic material often have different thermal expansion
coefficients.Both zeolites and activated carbon have found use in
hydrocarbon adsorption applications such as in automotive
exhaust conversion, especially hydrocarbons which are
emitted during the cold start period of automotive engine
operation. Emission standards for these hydrocarbons are
becoming ever more stringent. In these applications
zeolites and activated carbon are used in conjunction with
three-way catalysts.These materials are often provided in the form of
extruded bodies such as honeycombs. These materials do not
form good bonds by themselves and require the use of
binders to provide strength to extruded honeycombs. The
binders can be inorganic or organic.With carbon bodies, organic binders are typically
used and these binders can block the adsorption sites
because they are not burned out, thus reducing their
effectiveness as adsorbers. Also with organic binders, the
strength of the body is still relatively low, and if
heated above the decomposition or degradation temperature
of the binder, the strength is lost.Zeolite bodies are advantageously used in higher
tempe

A method for producing a pore-impregnated body
comprising a continuous high

strength substrate having open pores and being made of
material selected from the group consisting of ceramics,

glass, glass-ceramics, cermet, metal, oxides, and
combinations thereof, and active material embedded in the

open pores, wherein said active material is selected from
the group consisting of molecular sieve, activated carbon,

and combinations thereof,
comprising:


contacting said substrate with a slurry of active
material dispersed in a medium at subatmospheric pressure

to fill the open pores of the substrate with
the active material; and
drying substrate to remove slurry medium therefrom.
A method of claim 1 wherein the dried pore-filled
substrate is re-contacted with slurry and re-dried.
A method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said contacting is
done by the steps of:


i) introducing said substrate and said slurry into a
chamber at atmospheric pressure, and evacuating the major

portion of the air from said chamber to create
subatmospheric pressure therein;
ii) immersing said substrate in said slurry at the
subatmospheric pressure to allow a portion of the slurry

to enter the open pores of the substrate; and
iii) introducing air back into said chamber to force
at least some of the active material into the pores.
A method of claim 3 wherein the absolute air
pressure in the partially evacuated chamber is no greater

than about 200 millibar (150 mm Hg).
A method of claim 3 wherein the substrate from step
iii is resubjected to subatmospheric pressure to ensure

firm placement of active material in said pores.
Method of any one of claims 1-5 wherein the active
material is a hydrocarbon adsorbing agent, or a three-way

catalyst, or a NO

 conversion catalyst. 
A method of claim 1 wherein said substrate material is
selected from the group consisting of cordierite, mullite,

and combinations thereof.
A method of claim 1 wherein the wall porosity of
said substrate is at least about 45% by volume.
A method of claim 1 wherein the substrate has
an average wall po
re size of about 15 to 30 Âµm (micrometers) in
diameter.
A method of claim 1 wherein said molecular
sieve is selected from the group consisting of zeolite,

carbon molecular sieve, metallophosphates,
aluminophosphates, silicoaluminophosphates, and

combinations thereof, or from the group consisting of
faujasite, pentasil, mordenite, beta, or ultra stable Y,

ZSM type, and combinations thereof.
A method of claim 1 wherein the active material is
activated carbon and ZSM-5 zeolite.

structure.
