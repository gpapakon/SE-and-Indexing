<ABSTRACT>
The traction and support cable for conveyors is composed of a cable chain. A cable chain is composed of a plurality of cable chain sections, each cable chain section being composed of one cable section (1) having connecting pieces (3, 4) which are arranged at both ends. The cable chain sections are connected to one another at points of articulation. The cable is driven by means of a driving wheel (7) which forms an assembly together with a supporting and driving plate (8). The drive wheel (7) has recesses (9) for the positive accommodation between the cable chain sections of extended articulation-type connections which take the form of roller-like supporting elements. In order to ensure that a conveyor equipped in this manner operates perfectly, the length of the cable chain sections can be adjusted and the recesses in the driving plates are of such shape that compensation is automatically made for any differences in length which may exist.
