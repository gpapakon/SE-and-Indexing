<ABSTRACT>
A connection member for tubular profiles, used for example 
when making a connection between two tube ends (17, 18), or 

when mounting a component into the end of a tube. The 
connection member (10) is made of an elastic material, for 

,example plastic. It comprises at least one substantially 
cylindric dowel (12, 13) which is insertable into the end of 

the tubular profile and at least one peripherally outwards 
from the envelope surface of the dowel protruding flange 

(11) for axial positioning of the connection member in the 
tube end. A slot (15) extends in same plane as the 

longitudinal axis (16) of the dowel, from its surface and 
radially into the area of said longitudinal axis (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method for joining
together two tube ends by means of a connection member which
is made of an elastic material, for example plastic, and
comprising at least one substantially cylindric dowel which
is insertable into the end of the tubular profile and at
least one peripherally outwards from the envelope surface of
the dowel protruding flange for axial positioning of the
connection member in the tube end.Welding is frequently used, when a permanent connection is
to be made between two metal tube ends. Welding is a method
which requires relatively great investments in machine
equipment. In general, a welded joint must be grinded and
treated with a corrosion preventing agent. The welding can
cause material weakness in areas adjacent the welding.Adhesive bonding with connection members can also be used to
achieve a permanent connection between two meta pipe ends.
However, this method is demanding with reference the gap
between the inside surfaces of the tube ends and the outside
surfaces of the connection member, which gap should not be
larger than some hundreds of a millimetre. Therefore,
adhesive bonding while jointing for example two aluminium
tube ends, generally implies that the surfaces in the area
of connection must be machined with bigger exactness than
the usual production tolerances.Production engineering is mostly aimed at restriction of
weight and optimizing the durability of a product, for 
better ise of the material. At the same time, it is
desirable that production is simplified and costs are
reduced.Bonding of tubes which have been bent to a certain radius
has been especially difficult to accomplish, since the
deflection causes a certain uncontrollable ovality in the
transection of the tube. This ovality is difficult to
correct, whithout ending up with a joint area which has a
different section from the rest of the tube.In DE-C-846.644 there is disclosed an adhesive joining cf
for example tube members by using a connection member having
a stepped configuration adapted to fit with a
correspondingly stepped interior surface of the tube members
to be connected.DE-B-1.037.342 discloses a plug for connecting framwork
profiles. The plug is inserted in holes in the profiles to
be connected and is provided with a longitudinal slot which
makes the plug compressible and thus provide a firm
connection. This plug is not intended for the connection of
tube profiles.EP-A-7,065 discloses a connection member made of an elastic
material, comprising a cylindrical dowel which

<CLAIMS>
A method for joining together two tube ends (17,18) by
means of a connection member (10) which is made of an

elastic material, for example plastic, and comprising at
least one substantially cylindrical dowel (12,13) which is

insertable into the end of the tubular profile and at least
one peripherally outwards from the envelope surface of the

dowel protruding flange (11) for axial positioning of the
connection member in the tube end,
characterized in,
compressing the connection member (10), so that its external
dimensions are smaller than the inner diameter of the tube

ends (17,18), which is accomplished by the fact that said connection (10)
member is provided with a slot (15) extending in the same plane

as the longitudinal axis (16) of the dowel, from its peripheral surface
and radially beyond the area of said longitudinal axis,
inserting the connection member (10) into one of the tube ends (17,18),
subsequently releasing of the compression of the connection

member (10), and
sliding the other tube end onto the connection member (10).
A method according to claim 1,
characterized in,

applying adhesive into the respective tube ends (17,18)
before inserting the connection member (10).
A method according to claim 1 or 2, for joining the two
ends of a tubular profile (17,18) which has been bent into

a ring shape,
characterized in,

the orientation of the connection member (10), so that the
slot (15) extends substantially perpendicular to the ring

plane.
