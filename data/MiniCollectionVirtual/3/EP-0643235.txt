<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a destruction-free and reengageable overload protection for machines prone to jamming, such as double toggle-lever crushers or single-jaw crushers, in the form of a coupling in which two coupling parts (16, 18) are fixed relative to one another up to a limit of frictional engagement by way of coupling bodies (30), whereas, when the limit of frictional engagement is exceeded, they no longer remain fixed and the coupling is disengaged. The coupling elements are expediently rolling elements and can take the form of balls.
