<ABSTRACT>
In order to increase the modulus properties of a 
rubber compound it is desirable to achieve control of 

the cure morphology within a rubber matrix. The 
placement of curatives in a rubber matrix can be 

controlled by incorporating the curatives into a 
carrier and mixing the carrier with a rubber compound. 

In a preferred embodiment, the carrier can be made 
having the morphology of a short fiber, and the 

curatives can be oriented like a short fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of reinforcing
or increasing the modulus of an elastomeric matrix,
and an elastomeric matrix made by the method.The main benefit of including short fibers in an
elastomeric matrix is the large increase in low strain
moduli demonstrated by the elastomer. This increase
in modulus can be achieved using low levels of fibers.
This is due to the rheological differences between an
elastomer reinforced using short fibers, as compared
to such properties in an elastomer matrix that is
reinforced with spherical or particulate type fillers.
The expected improvement in modulus can be calculated
using the Semi-empirical Guth-Gold equation,
h = ho(1 + 0.67fc + 1.62f2c2),
where h is the viscosity of the composite, ho is the
matrix viscosity, f is the aspect ratio (l/d) and c is
the volume concentration. From this equation, it can
be seen that increasing aspect ratio (at constant
concentration) is the main factor of short fiber
reinforcement in an elastomeric matrix, regardless of
the type of material used.One of the disadvantages of using short fiber
reinforcement is that the short fibers are a foreign
material in an elastomer matrix, and there is not
perfect adhesion between the short fibers and the
matrix. Consequently, over a long period of time, as
the elastomer works, the short fibers separate from 
the elastomer in which they are embedded, because the
fibers do not flex in the matrix in the same way as the
elastomer molecules. When the fibers become separated
from the elastomer, their presence becomes detrimental to
the properties of the elastomer.FR-A- 2.139.409 discloses the addition of curing
agents and other additives in granular form to an
elastomeric material. The object is to avoid dust, odor
and mixing problems encountered with such additives in
powdery form. US-A- 2.933.464 discloses free-flowing
pellets of uniform composition composed of aggregates of
a powdered rubber vulcanization accelerator; such pellets
do not stick, fall through the mixing rolls.It is an object of this invention to provide a
method of reinforcing an elastomer that does not rely on
the presence of short fibers or other reinforcing
material. It is also an object of the invention to
provide a modulus gradient in an elastomer around fiber
type materials in order to minimize the difference in
modulus between the fiber and an elastomeric matrix, in
order to minimize the separation of fiber reinforcement
from its elastomeric matrix.There is provided a method of forming domains 
in an elastomer matrix,
