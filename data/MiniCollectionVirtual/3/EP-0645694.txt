<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for managing palettes in 
collaborative systems. This includes one or more host 

computers connected to one or more remote computers, wherein 
an image displayed on the host computer is substantially 

simultaneously displayed on the remote computer. The 
invention recognizes when a change is made to a system palette 

on the host computer, and communicates those changes to the 
remote computer. A system palette on the remote computer may 

be updated to reflect the logical palette, and the changes made 
therein, depending upon whether the collaborative system is 

active or idle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
computer networking, and in particular, to a method and
apparatus for managing display palettes in
collaborative systems.Many computer programs use as many colors as are
available from the computer's video subsystem to allow
the programs to have as much visual impact as possible.
This is fine when displaying a computer program on one
system, because the computer program has full control
over the system, but special techniques must be
developed to allow the computer program to be displayed
identically when shown simultaneously on many
computers.In PCT Publication WO 91/09378 Options Unlimited
Research Corporation, there is described a full-duplex
video communication system, but there is no disclosure
of management of the different colour requirements of
different terminals.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide an improved method of and system for
managing display palettes in a collaborative system.According to a first aspect of the present
invention there is provided a method of sharing images
between a host computer and a remote computer in a
collaborative system comprising one or more host
computers connected to one or more remote computers, 
wherein an image displayed on the host computer is
substantially simultaneously displayed on the remote
computer, the method being characterized by managing
palettes used in forming the image, comprising the
steps of: recognizing when a change is made to a system
palette on the host computer; communicating the system
palette to the remote computer; creating a logical
palette on the remote computer to reflect the system
palette on the host computer; and selectively updating
a system palette on the remote computer to reflect the
logical palette.According to a second aspect of the present
invention there is provided an image - sharing computer
system, comprising a host computer connected to one or
more remote computers and arranged to display an image
on the host computer and the remote computer
substantially simultaneously; and characterized by palette management
means, in the host computer and in the remote computer,
comprising means for selectively intercepting the image
and functions which alter the image on the host
computer; means for selectively communicating the
intercepted image and functions to the remote computer;
means, for receiving the intercepted image and
functions from the host computer; and means, for
selectively displaying the intercepted image on the
remote computer and for

<CLAIMS>
A method of sharing images between a host
computer and a remote computer in a collaborative

system comprising one or more host computers (10)
connected to one or more remote computers, wherein an

image displayed on the host computer (10) is
substantially simultaneously displayed on the remote

computer (10), the method being characterized by
managing palettes used in forming the image, comprising

the steps of:

   recognizing when a change is made to a system
palette (26) on the host computer (10); communicating

the system palette (26) to the remote computer (10);
creating a logical palette (28) on the remote computer

(10) to reflect the system palette (26) on the host
computer (10); and selectively updating a system

palette (26) on the remote computer (10) to reflect the
logical palette (28).
A method according to claim 1, characterized
in that the updating step comprises the step of

replacing the system palette (26) on the remote
computer (10) with the logical palette (28) from the

host computer (10) when the collaborative system is
active on the remote computer (10).
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the updating step comprises the

step of selectively replacing the system palette (26) 
on the remote computer (10) with the logical palette

(28) from the host computer ( 10) when the
collaborative system is idle on the remote computer

(10).
A method according to any one of the previous
claims, characterized by the steps of: intercepting an

image displayed on the host computer (10); intercepting
functions that alter the image on the host computer

(10); selectively communicating the intercepted image
and intercepted functions to the remote computer (10);

selectively displaying the intercepted image on the
remote computer (10); and altering the intercepted

image according to the intercepted functions.
A method according to any one of the previous
claims, characterized by the steps of: translating a

first device dependent image suitable for display on
the host computer (10) into a device independent image

using the system palette (26) on the host computer
(10); transmitting the device independent image to the

remote computer (10); translating the device
independent image into a second device dependent image

suitable for display on the remote computer (10) using
the logical palette (28) on the remote computer (10);

and displaying the second device dependent image. 
An image - sharing computer system, comprising
a host computer (10) connected to one or more remote

computers (10) and arranged to display an image on the
host computer (10) and the remote computer (10)

substantially simultaneously characterized by palette management
means (16,30-48), in the host computer (10) and in the

remote computer, comprising means (34) for selectively
intercepting the image and functions which alter the

image on the host computer (10); means (16,48) for
selectively communicating the intercepted image and

functions to the remote computer (10) ; means (44), for
receiving the intercepted image and functions from the

host computer (10); and means (46), for selectively
displaying the intercepted image on the remote computer

(10) and for altering the intercepted image according
to the intercepted functions.
An apparatus according to claim 6,
characterized by the means for selectively

intercepting the image incorporating means (12,38) for
displaying the image on the host computer (10).
An apparatus according to claim 6 or claim 7,
characterized by the means (34) for selectively

intercepting the image incorporating means (30,36) for
performing functions on the host computer to alter the

image. 
An apparatus according to any one of claims 6

to 8, characterized by means (38), for translating a
first device dependent image suitable for display on

the host computer (10) into a device independent image
using a first palette stored on the host computer (10);

means (16,48) for transmitting the device independent
image to the remote computer (10); means (42), for

translating the device independent image into a second
device dependent image suitable for display on the

remote computer (10) using a second palette stored on
the remote computer (10); and means (12,46), for

displaying the second device dependent image.
