<ABSTRACT>
Forming rollers (1, 1) having a tooth tip concave 
portion (2a) at the tip of a tooth tip portion (2), a tooth 

bottom convex portion (3a) at a bottom of a tooth bottom 
portion (3) and louver cutter (4) at an oblique line portion 

between the tooth tip portion (2) and the tooth bottom portion 
(3). A radius of an arc-shaped portion of the tooth tip 

concave portion (2a) at front side of rotational direction is 
set to be larger than a radius of an arc-shaped portion of the 

tooth tip concave portion (2a) at a rear side of the 
rotational direction. A radius of an apex portion (2b) of the 

tooth tip portion (2) at the front side is set to be smaller 
than a radius of an apex portion (2c) of the tooth tip portion 

(2) at the rear side and louver cutter (4) at the oblique line 
portion is formed to have a predetermined interval from the 

apex portions (2b), (2c) of tooth tip portion (2). Therefore, 
flat folded portions having substantially the same curvature 

at both shoulder portions thereof horizontal are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to forming rollers according 
to the preamble of claim 1 Conventionally, the corrugated fins utilized for heat 
exchangers have a folded portion with an arc-shape. The 
corrugated fin having the arc-shaped folded portion was 
decreased contact area with a flat tube disposed so as to 
contact both side of the folded portion when assembled. 
Consequently, heat transmission efficiency between the 
corrugated fin and the flat tube is decreased and the 
resistance to air flowing between the corrugated fin is 
increased. To solve the above problems, a corrugated fin having 
a folded portion, which is shaped flat, is suggested in 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) 55-110892. The 
corrugated fin having a flat folded portion is formed by a 
pair of forming rollers, with one being shown in an enlarged 
view in Fig. 4. Forming roller 20 has concave portion 21 at  
 
the tip of the tooth and convex portion 22 at the bottom of 
the tooth. The corrugated fin is machined by making fin 
material pass through an engaged and rotated pair of forming 
rollers 20. Concave portion 21, shapes an arc having a 
predetermined radius r. Louver cutters 23 are entirely formed 
on the oblique lines between concave portions 21 and convex 
portions 22. When a corrugated fin is formed by a pair of forming 
rollers 20, 20, the formed corrugated fin has flat folded 
portion 26 slants as shown in Fig. 7. Each curvature, at both 
ends of the folded fin, is different on the left and right 
sides, so that enough contact area between the corrugated fin 
25 and a tube can not be secured. As shown in Fig. 5, the pair of forming rollers 20, 
20 engage together and rotate together in the direction of the 
arrow. Fin material W is machined (or formed, processed) by 
passing through the pair of rollers 20, 20. Fin material W 
pinched between concave portion 21 of tooth tip and convex 
portion 22 of tooth bottom is push up at "a" in Fig. 5 by 
convex portion on 22, so that a strong tension is caused at 
fin material W. Therefore, the portion "a" of fin material W 
receives a strong burnish operation (operation to strongly rub 
surface). At this time at "b" portion, louvers have been 
completely cut on fin by louver cutter 23. At "c" portion, 
fin material W is still on louver cutter 23 and louvers have 
not been completely cut yet. Next as shown in Fig. 6 at "d", louvers are  
 
completely cut and fin material W is drawn, so that the 
tension is released and burnish operation by convex portion 22 
is
