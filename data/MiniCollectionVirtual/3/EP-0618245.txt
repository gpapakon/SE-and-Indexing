<ABSTRACT>
Polyol-epoxide addition products obtained by reacting   (A) an aliphatic polyol having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of from 200 to 20,000 g/mol and (B) an epoxide compound containing at least two epoxide groups per molecule and having an epoxide equivalent weight of from 100 to 2,000 g/mol, where the ratio between the number of equivalents of OH groups and the number of equivalents of EP groups is from 1:3.6 to 1:10, preferably from 1:4 to 1:9, particularly preferably from 1:4.5 to 1:8, and the epoxide equivalent weight of the addition product is between 150 g/mol and at least 8,000 g/mol, preferably between 250 g/mol and 1,000 g/mol. These addition products are used as nonionic emulsifiers in water-dilutable liquid epoxy resins.

<CLAIMS>
The use of polyol/epoxy adducts obtainable by
reaction of


(A) an aliphatic polyol having an average
molecular weight (Mw) of 200 to

20,000 g/mole

and
(B) an epoxy compound having at least two epoxy
groups per molecule and an epoxy equivalent

weight of 100 to 2000 g/mole,

the equivalent ratio of the OH groups to the EP groups
being 1:3.6 to 1:10 and the epoxy equivalent weight of

the adduct being between 150 g/mole and 8000 g/mole, as
emulsifiers for epoxy resins.
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
component (B) has been selected from diglycidyl ethers

of polyhydric phenols.
The use as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
component (B) has been selected from diglycidyl ethers

of bisphenol A and bisphenol F.
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
component (A) used is a polyalkylene glycol.
The use as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
component (A) used is a polyethylene glycol.
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
polyol/epoxy adducts are obtainable by reaction of the

polyols (A) with the epoxy compounds (B) in the
presence of catalysts at 50 to 200Â°C. 
A water-dilutable epoxy/liquid resin system,
comprising an epoxy liquid resin and water and

obtainable by the use as claimed in claim 1 of
polyol/epoxy adducts obtainable by reaction of


(A) an aliphatic polyol having an average
molecular weight (Mw) of 200 to 20,000 g/mole

and
(B) an epoxy compound having at least two epoxy
groups per molecule and an epoxy equivalent

weight of 100 to 2000 g/mole,

the equivalent ratio of the OH groups to the EP groups
being 1:3.6 to 1:10 and the epoxy equivalent weight of

the adduct being between 150 g/mole and 8000 g/mole.
