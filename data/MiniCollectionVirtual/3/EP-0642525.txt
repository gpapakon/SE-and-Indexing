<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new acyl derivatives 
of nucleosides and nucleoside analogues which have anti-viral 
properties and to pharmaceutical compounds 
containing these novel compounds. A large number of serious diseases, such as 
AIDS, hepatitis B, herpes and gynaecological cancer, as a 
late result of papilloma warts, are caused by viral 
infections. Viruses are small infectious agents which are 
incapable of independent replication and thus are 
dependent on a host cell to replicate. The genetic 
material of the virus is either RNA or DNA. When infecting an organism, the virus attaches 
to a specific host cell. The virus penetrates the 
cytoplasmic membrane after attachment and the viral 
genome is released from the virus particle. The viral 
genome is usually transported to the cell nucleus where 
new viral genomes are replicated. New viral protein is 
synthesized in the cytoplasm and new particles are formed 
either close to the cytoplasmic or nuclear membrane. Some viruses have genomic material which is 
directly (DNA virus) or indirectly (Reverse transcription 
of RNS, retrovirus)  
 
incorporated in the host cell genomes. Extracellular viruses are neutralized by circulating antibodies 
and the cellular immune apparatus may attack and remove infected 
cells. Viruses within the infected cells escape immune 
surveillance if viral antigens are not exposed on the surface of 
the cells. The immune attack on infected organs contributes to disease by a 
mechanism commonly called virus induced immuno-pathology. The mechanisms underlying some of the more important viral 
diseases differ. When suffering from a HIV infection, the patient's T helper 
cells are invaded and destroyed. This leads to a 
immunodeficiency condition, which makes the patient very 
succeptible even to infections which normally are conquered by 
the immune system without any harmful effects for the patient. The Hepatitis B virus invades the liver cells, and the patient 
may become very ill when the immune system tries to rid the body 
of these infected cells. If the infection is not conquered by 
the immune system at an early stage, the result will be chronic 
hepatitis. The patient will thus be infectious throughout his 
life. For a group of patients the chronic hepatitis will develop 
into cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. In herpes simplex infections, the virus enters the epidermal 
cells originally. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) travels up to a nerve 
center where it lies latent to break out at intervals. Although 
not life
