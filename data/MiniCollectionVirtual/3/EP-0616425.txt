<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed audio amplifier arrangement comprises a first amplifier 
stage (2) for influencing the signal strength of the received audio signal for at least part 

of the frequency spectrum of an audio signal received through an input (1). An output 
amplifier stage (3) amplifies the signal influenced by the first amplifier stage. Detection 

means present in the output amplifier stage (3) detect overloads of the output amplifier 
stage (3). A control circuit causes, in response to the detection signal, an adjustment to 

be made of the influence caused by the first amplifier stage if the overload signalled by 
the detection signal transgresses a certain limit. This limit depends on the magnitude of 

the adjustment already carried out, so that the degree of overload corresponding to the 
limit increases when the extent of the adjustment increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an audio amplifier arrangement having an audio
signal input for receiving an audio signal, comprising a first amplifier stage for
influencing the signal strength of the received audio signal for at least part of the
frequency spectrum of the audio signal, an output amplifier stage for amplifying the
signal influenced by the first amplifier stage, the output amplifier stage comprising
detection means for detecting an overload of the output amplifier stage, and the audio
amplifier arrangement comprising a control means for adjusting the influence of the first
amplifier stage on the received audio signal in response to a signal from the detection
means in the case where the degree of overload indicated by the signal from the
detection means exceeds a limit laid down by a certain limit criterion in order to reduce
the signal strength of the influenced audio signal.An arrangement of said type is known, for example, from Laboratory note
A-106 "Digital controlled stereo audioprocessor TDA730X manual" SGS-THOMPSON;
November 1989. In prior-art arrangement the output amplifier stage produces a
detection pulse with each overload. In reaction to each detection pulse the adjustment
(reduction) of the gain factor of the first amplifier stage is enhanced by a step of 2 dB.
In this manner there is avoided that distortion occurs on reproduction of the sound
represented by the audio signal. If for a certain period of time thereafter no detection
pulses are produced any longer, the adjustment is cancelled in steps.The arrangement has the drawback that in the case where the user sets the
volume to such a high level that the control means intervene by reducing the gain
factor, a change of the volume setting by the user has hardly perceivable consequences.
To the listener it seems as if the arrangement does not react to a change of the volume
setting.It is an object of the invention to provide an arrangement in which the
overload of the output amplifier stage is largely reduced, but in which a change of the
volume setting by the user does have a clearly perceivable effect.According to the invention, this object is achieved in an arrangement as 
defined in the opening paragraph which is further characterized in that the limit laid
down by the limit criterion depends on the adjustment already realised by the control
means, so that the degree of overload corresponding to the limit increases when the
adjustment increases.As the limit laid down by the limit criterion depends on the adjustment in

when the adjustment increases.
Audio amplifier arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the
control means (5) comprise means for increasing the adjustment in steps after an

uninterrupted series of a specific number of overloads has been detected in which series the
time intervals between the successive overloads do not exceed a first length of time, means

overload within a time interval having a second length of time, while said number of

overloads to be detected for an increase of the adjustment increases with the extent of the

Audio amplifier arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the
adjustment realised by the control means (5) is an adjustment of the bass setting or a

reduction of a volume setting, in which the control means (5) comprise selection means for
selecting according to a specific selection criterion and in response to the current

adjustment, a reduction of the bass setting and/or reduction of the volume setting to modify
the adjustment of the setting.
Audio amplifier arrangement as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the
control means (5) comprise a memory for storing a series of first and second codes, the

selection means selecting a code in this series having a position that depends on the current
adjustment and making a selection determined by the selected code.
