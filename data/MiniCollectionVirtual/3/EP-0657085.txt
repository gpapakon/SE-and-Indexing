<ABSTRACT>
A sound receiving and sound reproduction apparatus includes a microphone and loudspeaker. The microphone has a cylindrical transducer housing with a centre section and two end sections. The centre section has elliptical and faces that converge mirror-symmetrically downwardly and towards the front of the microphone. The end sections are solid blocks that are spaced from the centre section and have similarly oriented end faces. In the loudspeaker, there are three components, a centre unit with centre and end sections spaced slightly along a common axis and two end components spaced to opposite ends of the centre unit. In each case, the speakers radiate through elliptical gaps that converge upwardly to a centre plane of the loudspeaker unit. Periodic chambers are connected to each of the units of the loudspeaker.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sound receiving and sound reproduction 
apparatus. One aspect of the invention relates to a microphone comprising a 
cylindrical transducer housing with a lateral axis and having a centre section and two 
end sections, the centre section having non-parallel, elliptical end faces oriented mirror-symmetrically 
with respect to a plane perpendicular to the lateral axis, the end sections 
having inner end faces confronting and parallel to respective ones of the centre section 
end faces, and microphone transducers mounted to receive sound from beween the 
respective end sections and the centre section. Another aspect of the invention relates to a loudspeaker comprising: 
a cylindrical, hollow housing with a lateral axis and having a 
centre section and two end sections, the centre section having non-parallel end faces 
oriented mirror-symmetrically with respect to a plane perpendicular to the axis, the end 
sections having inner end faces confronting and parallel to respective ones of the 
centre section end faces: and four speaker transducers mounted in the housing, with two centre 
transducers in the centre section radiating towards respective ones of the end sections, 
and one end transducer in each of the end sections radiating towards the centre 
section, each transducer being sealed to the housing. A microphone and a loudspeaker of these types are disclosed in 
EP-A-0 256 688 (CA-A-1 282 711, granted 9 April 1991 to Raymond Wehner, the 
applicant in this application). CA-A-1 060 350, granted 14 August 1979, and EP-A-0 256 688, 
describe microphone and loudspeaker systems that are directed to the recording and 
open-air reproduction of sound fields so that the reproduced sound field includes the 
directional and range information from the originally recorded field for detection by the 
human hearing system. Microphones in these systems are intended to be analogs of 
the human hearing system, detecting the range and direction sound information that 
would be detected by the human hearing system. The loudspeaker aspect of the 
system exemplifies the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of wave movement.  
 The loudspeakers are intended to invert the detection process and to 
generate a sound field containing the direction and range information originally 
available. The present invention is concerned with certain improvements in the 
earlier systems. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a 
microphone of the above described type that is characterized in
