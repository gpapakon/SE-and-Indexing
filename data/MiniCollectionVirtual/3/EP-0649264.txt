<ABSTRACT>
A video signal processing circuit includes: a decoder (43, 44) for decoding 
a composite color difference signal modulated such that two color difference 

signals are inverted in polarity at every horizontal period to provide a red color 
difference signal (R-Y) and a blue color difference signal (B-Y); a first filter (45) 

composed of 2N (
N
 is a positive integer) delay circuits (46-1 etc) each for 
sequentially delaying the red color difference signal (R-Y) by one horizontal 

period 1H, 2N+1 multiplyers (47a-1 etc) each for multiplying a delayed color 
difference signal by a respective predetermined coefficient, and a circuit (48) for 

adding outputs of the multipliers; and a second filter (50) composed of 2N delay 
circuits (51-1 etc) each for sequentially delaying the blue color difference signal 

(B-Y) by 1H, 2N+1 multipliers (52a-1 etc) each for multiplying a delayed blue 
color difference signal by a respective predetermined coefficient, and a circuit (53) 

for adding outputs of the multiplying circuits. A total sum of coefficients of odd-numbered 
multipliers and a total sum of coefficients of even-numbered multipliers 

of the first filter (45) are made equal, and a total sum of coefficients of odd-numbered 
multipliers and a total sum of coefficients of even-numbered multipliers 

of the second filter (50) are made equal to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video signal processing apparatus or circuits.
Embodiments of the invention may for example be used with a video tape recorder
(VTR) in which a chroma signal of a PAL video signal is averaged, i.e. the hue of a
picture is matched.FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows an example of a previously
proposed video signal processing apparatus for use with a VTR in which a chroma
signal of a PAL video signal is averaged, i.e. the hue of a picture is matched.As shown in FIG. 1, the video signal processing apparatus comprises a Y/C
separating circuit 2 for separating a composite video signal, such as a PAL video
signal or the like, supplied thereto through an input terminal 1 from a signal source
(not shown) to provide a luminance signal Y and a chroma signal C, a luminance
signal processing circuit 3 for processing the luminance signal Y supplied thereto from
the Y/C separating circuit 2, an averaging circuit 5 for averaging the chroma signal
C supplied thereto from the Y/C separating circuit 2 to provide red and blue color
difference signals R-Y and B-Y and a decoder 9 for decoding the red and blue color
difference signals R-Y and B-Y supplied thereto from the averaging circuit 5. The averaging circuit 5 is composed of adding circuits 6, 8
and a 1H delay circuit 7 having a delay time of 1H (H represents one
horizontal period). The adding circuit 6 subtracts the 1H-preceding
chroma signal C delayed by the 1H delay circuit 7 from the chroma
signal C supplied thereto from the Y/C separating circuit 2 to
provide a chroma signal C for an averaged red color difference
signal R-Y. The adding circuit 8 adds the chroma signal C supplied
thereto from the Y/C separating circuit 2 and the 1H-preceding
chroma signal C delayed by the 1H delay circuit 7 to provide a
chroma signal C for an averaged blue color difference signal B-Y.The decoder 9 comprises an automatic phase control (APC)
circuit 10 for extracting a burst signal from the chroma signal C
supplied thereto from the Y/C separating circuit 2 based on a burst
flag BF representing the position of a burst signal supplied thereto
through an input terminal 10B from other circuit, such as a VTR (not
shown) or the like to generate a subcarrier RC of the red color
difference signal R-Y and a subcarrier BC of the blue color
difference signal B-Y, a chroma decoder 11 for decoding the chroma
signal C for the red color difference signal R-Y supplied thereto
from the averaging circuit 5 based on the subcarrier RC supplied
thereto from the APC circuit
