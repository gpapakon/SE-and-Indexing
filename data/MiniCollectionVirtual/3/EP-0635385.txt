<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heating and air-conditioning system (1) in a motor vehicle, in particular a lorry, which system is arranged behind or under the dashboard and the control part (3) of which, which is connected to it, projects into an opening (4) provided in the dashboard or in a part (2) of the latter serving as a cover for the system (1). In order to be able to compensate for tolerance differences caused by manufacture and installation both of the heating and air-conditioning system (1) and also of the dashboard or the part (2) thereof, according to the invention it is provided that the control part (3) is mounted, by means of special spring elements (5), at a distance from the heating and air-conditioning system (1) such that it can move in a floating manner to a limited extent in three planes in such a manner that regardless of the tolerance-affected installation position of the heating and air-conditioning system (1), when assembling the dashboard or the part (2) thereof the control part fixes itself in position, in a precisely corresponding manner, in the opening (4) provided there.

<CLAIMS>
Heating/air-conditioning system (1) in a motor vehicle, particularly in a 
truck, which system (1) is located behind or under the instrument panel and 

whose operating element (3) connected with said system (1) protrudes into 
an orifice (4) provided in said instrument panel or in a portion (2) of it, 

which portion (2) serves as a cover for said system (1), characterised in 
that the operating element (3) is mounted in three planes by several spring 

elements (5) in a restrictedly movable and floating manner on and at a 
distance from the heating/air-conditioning system (1) in such a way that, 

irrespective of the tolerance-affected installation position of the heating/air-conditioning 
system (1) in the vehicle
, said operating element (3) during 
assembly of the instrument panel or a of portion (2) of it, fixes itself exactly 

in the orifice (4) provided there, the spring elements (5) being attached, on 
the one hand, to said operating element (3) and, on the other hand, to the 

heating/air-conditioning system (1) and ensuring the operating element's 
(3) movability in all directions with that part between these clamping points 

which is free and also maintaining the distance between operating element 
(3) and heating/air-conditioning system (1) during assembly. 
Heating/air-conditioning system according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the orifice (4) in the instrument panel or in the respective portion (2) of it 

has such a shape and size that the operating element (3) fits into it with 
little play and leaves virtually no edge. 
Heating/air-conditioning system according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
a front panel (9) can be added to the operating element (3) which panel (9) 

can be attached to said operating element (3) from the front and fixed in 
position. 
Heating/air-conditioning system according to Claim 1, characterised in that, 
if a circumferential gap at an equal distance is to be maintained between the 

operating element (3) and the orifice in the instrument panel or in the 
respective portion (2) of it, which orifice has a larger cross section, the 

operating element (3) is equipped with positioning organs (12) which are 
firmly attached to said operating element (3) and which during assembly of 

the instrument panel or the respective portion of it (2) can be engaged with  
 

positioning organs (13) provided on said instrument panel/respective 
portion. 
Heating/air-conditioning system according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the positioning organs (12) on the one component are designed as 

protruding, at least partially conical positioning pins and that the positioning 
organs (13) on the other component are designed as bores, into which the 

positioning pins can penetrate. 
Heating/air-conditioning system according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
a front panel (9) can be added to the operating element (3) which panel (9) 

can be inserted from the front into the orifice (4) in the instrument panel or 
in the respective portion (2) of it, in which orifice said front panel (9) dips 

into the remaining gap around the operating element (3) and is fixed in 
position via the operating element (3). 
Heating/air-conditioning system according to one of the foregoing Claims, 
characterised in that the operating element (3) is, under initial tension, 

pressed against the inside of the instrument panel or the respective portion 
(2) of it via spring elements (5) attached to the instrument panel or the 

respective portion (2) of it when the latter is in attached position and is 
fastened to it from the outside of said instrument panel or said respective 

portion (2) of it by means of screws. 
Heating/air-conditioning system according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the operating element (3) has a base (14) with a rectangular cross section, 

to the two long sides of which base an approximately U-shaped bow spring 
(5; 5/1, 5/2) can be fixed in position by clipping it into place in suitable 

provisions (15), the two legs of the U (5/1, (5/2) of which bow extend 
beyond the bottom of the operating element (3) by identical length which 

roughly equals the height of said operating element (3) and in the free part 
which determines the movability of the operating element (3) have an 

undulating form and are at their free end attached to the heating/air-conditioning 
system (1).
