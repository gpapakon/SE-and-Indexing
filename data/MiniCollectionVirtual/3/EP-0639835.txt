<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic random access memory device causes sense 
amplifier circuits (34a/34b/34c/34d) to serve as a cache 

memory for sequentially delivering data bits in the sense 
amplifier circuits, and a row address buffer unit (36a) is 

controlled independently of the sense amplifier circuits 
(34a/34b/34c/34d) so as to change the row address signal 

without canceling the data bits in the sense amplifier 
circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dynamic random access
memory device and, more particularly, to a dynamic random
access memory device having sense amplifiers serving as a
cache memory for high speed sequential access such as, for
example, a page mode access.A dynamic random access memory device according to the
preamble part of claim 1 is known from US-A-5,127,739.A typical example of the dynamic random access memory
device is illustrated in figure 1 of the drawings, and
comprises an array of latch circuits 100 to 10n, an array
of AND gates 110 to 11n, a row address decoder unit 12 for
selectively driving word lines 13, a memory cell array 14
associated with a plurality of bit line pairs 15 and a
sense amplifier unit 16 for developing potential
differences on the bit line pairs 15. Though not shown in
the drawings, a plurality of dynamic random access memory
cells are incorporated in the memory cell arrays, and the
word lines 13 and the bit line pairs 15 are selectively
coupled to the plurality of dynamic random access memory
cells. The prior art dynamic random access further comprises
a column address buffer circuit 17, a column address
decoder unit 18 coupled to the column address buffer
circuit 17, a column selector unit 19 for selectively
coupling the plurality of bit line pairs 15 to a data bus
20 under the control of the column address decoder unit 18
and an input/output circuit 21 coupled between the data bus
20 and an input/output data pin 22, and a write-in data bit
and a read-out data bit are transferred from and to the
input/output data pin 22.The prior art dynamic random access memory device
further comprises a timing controller 23 for producing
various internal timing signals in response to external
control signals. A row address strobe signal RAS and a
column address strobe signal are two of those external
control signals, and a row address latch signal RL and a
column address latch signal CL are produced from the row
address strobe signal RAS and the column address strobe
signal CAS.The prior art dynamic random access memory device thus
arranged behaves in a data access mode as follows. A row
address signal indicative of a row address is supplied to
address pins ADD0 to ADDn, and is stored in the latch 
circuits 100 to 10n in response to the row address latch
signal RL. The AND gates 110 to 11n are enabled with the
row address latch signal RL, and transfers the internal row
address bits X0 to Xn to the row address decoder unit 12.The row address decoder unit 12 is responsive to the
internal
