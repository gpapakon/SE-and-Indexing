<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition useful for prophylactic 
or therapeutic treatment of ophthalmological diseases, 

comprising 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an essential 

component. The pharmaceutical composition of the present 
invention is useful for treating various types of 

ophthalmological diseasses, particularly cataract and retinal 
diseases caused by aging and diabetes mellitus, and also both 

congenital and inherent cataracts due to drugs, external 
wound, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical 
composition useful for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment 
of ophthalmological diseases and, more particularly, it 
relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises 
3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof as an essential component. An increase in lipid peroxides in the eyeball due to 
aging or diabetes mellitus is believed to be a direct cause 
for ophthalmological diseases, particularly for cataract and 
retinal diseases (Free Radical no Rinsho, 2, 179-183(1987); 
Saishin Igaku, 33, 726-729(1978)). It has been also presumed 
that an increase in the lipid peroxide content in the eyeball 
may participate in the occurrence of both congenital cataract 
and acquired cataract due to drugs or trauma and, moreover, 
retinopathy of prematurity (Free Radical no Rinsho, 2, 
179-183(1987); Ganka Kiyo, 29, 119-127(1978)). Thus, in such 
diseases, it has been known that concentrations of 
glutathione, ascorbic acid, etc., which are biological radical 
scavengers (in vivo), are lowered, whereby peroxidation of 
lipids proceeds in the tissues, which causes an increase in 
the concentration of lipid peroxide.  Additionally, lipid peroxide in blood easily moves 
into the eyeball and, as a result thereof, the concentration 
of lipid peroxide in the eyeball further increases. The lipid 
peroxides accumulated in the eyeball injure the crystalline 
lens and the retina by oxidation, which is one of the major 
factors of causing the cataract and the retinal diseases. Therefore, it is expected that supplementation of 
exogenous radical scavenger to the eyeballs with deficiency in 
biological radical scavenger for the purpose of inhibiting 
lipid peroxidation may prevent the occurrence or the progress 
of the ophthalmological diseases such as cataract and retinal 
diseases. In clinics, the above-mentioned glutathione has 
been used as a remedy for cataract. However, some problems 
like that glutathione exhibits poor permeability through 
membranes have been reported, and there has been a demand for 
new drugs. The present inventors formerly found using actual 
pathological models that certain types of pyrazolone 
derivatives exhibited a potent inhibitory action against lipid 
peroxidation and showed a protective action to cerebral 
ischemic diseases and myocardinal ischemic disorders mainly 
caused by the peroxidation of lipids due to active oxygens 
(Japanese Patent Publication [Examined] Hei-5/35127). Paying
