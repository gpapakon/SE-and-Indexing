<ABSTRACT>
Bucket (1) comprising a strainer (8) and a mop, the bucket being provided with a corresponding handle (2) and having approximately half its base in the form a double slope towards the two sides to carry sand, earth and suchlike matter into one place, and having in at least an intermediate and extreme area a number of pairs of symmetrical orifices (6, 6') provided with nonreturn ramps [sprinkler pipes] (7, 7') that unidirectionally collect all the dust, waste, fluff and the like deposited at the bottom of the bucket; which bucket (1) is fitted, above said area, with a strainer (8) of which one side is connected to a partition so that its upper part forms a closed surface which retains floating matter in said area of the bucket, while its lower part has orifices to allow the liquid to move between the two areas of the bucket, said lower part comprising, in the face beneath the strainer, ribs (12, 13) designed to prevent used water from flowing out and being recycled when the liquid is stirred up by the mop.
