<ABSTRACT>
Heat-generating plant including a heat generator (1) which has especially a desulphurisation/denitrification zone (1-b) employing an absorbent, a means for removing dust (6) from the combustion fumes, a chimney for removing the effluents originating from the means (6), a means for regenerating the spent absorbent (17) and a means for filtering regenerated absorbent (22). According to the invention the absorbent employed is a calcium-containing product; the plant additionally comprises means (9) for preparing a solution intended for the regeneration and the sulphur-containing product originating from the said filtering means (22) is a fertilising product. The invention also relates to the process used by the said plant.
