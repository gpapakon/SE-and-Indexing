<DESCRIPTION>
 SEPARATION METHODTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a method of separating a particulate solid catalyst from a chemical reac- tion mixture which further comprises at least one other solid component, either during the reaction or after the reaction.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSeparation of a precipitate from a liquid is a well known process which can be carried out by decantation, filtration or centrifugation. However, if a reaction mixture contains two or more different solid components, there is no universal method of separating the solid components from each other. Filtration followed by mechanical separation of the solid components by sorting the particles is out of the question for most practical purposes. In some cases solid components can be separated from each other by mechanical processes like floatation. Other methods are physicochemical methods like extraction or partition, which utilize a difference in solubility of the components e.g. in water, in aqueous acid, in aqueous base or in organic solvents. A pre¬ requisite of the applicability of these methods is that con¬ ditions can be found under which the components to be separ¬ ated are stable.In an industrial process involving the use of a catalyst, the price of the catalyst is often a very important parameter in the overall economy of the process. Therefore, it is an advantage of major importance if the catalyst can be reused without significant loss of catalytic activity. When the catalyst is present in a reaction mixture together with another solid component which is either formed during the reaction, such as a by-product or the desired product, or present during the whole process, e.g. a solid starting 

material added in excess, the isolation and reuse of the catalyst is hampered.In such cases the catalyst can sometimes be iso¬ lated by extracting the other soli (s) with organic solvents and/or with acids or bases which will dissolve the soli (s) except for the catalyst. However, the activity of catalysts, including enzymes, is very sensitive to the presence of so- called catalyst poisons. Catalyst poisons exert their activi¬ ty e.g. by binding very strongly to the catalyst or by de- composing it. Thus, strong acids and bases often have an adverse effect on the activity of catalysts and particularly enzymes generally suffer irreversible damage on exposure to high concentrations of acids or bases. This imposes certain limitations on the use of acids and bases in the work up of reaction mixtures from enzymatic reactions when

CLAIMS
1. A method of separating a particulate solid cata¬ lyst from a reaction mixture which further comprises another particulate solid component and a liquid, characterized in
5 that one of the particulate solid components is given an apparent particle size which is outside the apparent particle size range of the other solid component(s) whereupon the re¬ action mixture is filtered or centrifuged using equipment which will retain the component(s) having the larger par- 10 tides and let the remainder of the mixture pass through.
2. A method according to claim l, characterized in that the solid component(s) to be separated from the catalyst has (have) an apparent particle size smaller than the lower limit of the apparent particle size range of the catalyst.
153. A method according to claim 1 or 2, character¬ ized in that the ratio between the apparent diameter of the larger particles and the apparent diameter of the smaller particles is at least 2.
4. A method according to claim 2 or 3, character- 20 ized in that the apparent particle diameter of the catalyst is in the range of from 25 to 10,000 μm, preferably from 50 to 750 μm, more preferred from 50 to 300 μm.
5. A method according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the solid catalyst is an immobilized
25 enzyme.
6. A method according to claim 5, characterized in that the immobilized enzyme is a protease, a metalloprotease, a serine protease, thermolysin, an amidase, an esterase or an acylase. 


 7. A method according to claim 5, characterized in that the immobilized enzyme is able to deacylate the 6-amino group of penicillin G or the 6-amino group of ampicillin.
8. A method according to any one of the claims 1 to 54, characterized in that the solid catalyst is an immobilized whole cell or cell homogenate preparation.
9. A method according to any one of the claims 2 to 8, characterized in that a solid product produced in a pro¬ cess in which the starting material(s) is (are) fully dis-
10 solved in the reaction mixture is separated continuously from the catalyst during the reaction by leading the filtrate from the filter which retains the catalyst only to a filter which retains the solid product synthesized and recirculating the filtrate from this filter to the catalyst.
1510. A method according to any one of the preceding claims for separating an immobilized enzyme used for catalyz¬ ing acylation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid, 7-amino- cephalosporanic acid, 7-amino-7-methoxycephalosporanic acid, 7-amino-3-methoxy-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid, 7-aminodes-

catalyzing acylation of L-phenylalanine methyl ester or D,L- phenylalanine methyl ester with a N-protected L-aspartic acid from the solid acylation product obtained when the reaction is conducted at such conditions that the product formed or a part thereof precipitates from the reaction mixture.
