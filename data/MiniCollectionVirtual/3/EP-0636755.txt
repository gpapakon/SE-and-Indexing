<CLAIMS>
A floor tile (1) comprising spacers (4) formed on the 
side faces, a plurality of spacers (4) being provided on 

each side face, which spacers (4) are constructed as 
substantially uprightly extending projections, the upper 

ends of the spacers (4) ending at a distance from the 
upper surface (2) of the floor tile (1), characterised 

in that the width of the spacers (4) decreases from 
bottom to top. 
A floor tile according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the edge between the upper surface (2) and the side 

faces (3) is bevelled or rounded (5). 
A floor tile according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the transitio
n between the spacers 
(4) and the side faces (3) is rounded or chamfered. 
A floor tile according to any one of the preceding 
claims with anti-slip bumps on its upper surface, 

characterised in that the longitudinal axes of the bumps 
(7) extend at an angle to all the side edges of the 

upper surface (2).
