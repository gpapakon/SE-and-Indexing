<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for flanging cylindrical bodies (14) by rolling, having a plurality of flanging rollers (10) which are rotatably mounted in a holder (22), roll on the cylindrical shell to be formed of the body (14) and form the flange geometry by virtue of their shape. In order to avoid penetration of burr or material of the body (14) between a boundary ring and the flanging rollers (10) and to ensure that the flanging diameter is uniform, the proposal is to provide at least one boundary element (17), which projects inwards beyond the cylindrical envelope surface (25) around the longitudinal axis (23) of the device, said envelope surface (25) being formed by those parts (15) of the flanging rollers (10) which shape the flange geometry.

<CLAIMS>
Device for roll-flanging at least in the rim region of
cylindrical bodies (14), with a plurality of flanging rollers

(10) which are rotatably mounted in a receptacle (22) and
roll on the cylindrical surface of the body (14) which is to

be shaped and by their contour form the flange geometry, and a
delimiting tool arrangement which determines the external

diameter of the flange (B) and which - viewed from the
longitudinal axis (23) of the receptacle (22) - is disposed

outside the flanging rollers (10), characterised in that the
delimiting tool arrangement has a tubular delimiting body

which is made in one piece and which with parts of its inner
surface facing the common longitudinal axis (23) of the device

and the cylindrical body (14) projects inwards between
adjacent flanging rollers (10) over the cylindrical envelope

surface (25) formed around the said longitudinal axis (23) by
the parts (15) of the flanging rollers (10) which shape the

flange geometry.
Device for roll-flanging at least in the rim region of
cylindrical bodies (14), with a plurality of flanging rollers

(10) which are rotatably mounted in a receptacle (22) and
roll on the cylindrical surface of the body (14) which is to

be shaped and by their contour form the flange geometry, and a
delimiting tool arrangement which determines the external

diameter of the flange (B) and which - viewed from the
longitudinal axis (23) of the receptacle (22) - is disposed

outside the flanging rollers (10), characterised in that the
delimiting tool arrangement has a plurality of delimiting

bodies (17) which, at least when the maximum flange diameter
is reached, are disposed between adjacent flanging rollers

(10) and which with their surface facing the common
longitudinal axis (23) of the device and the cylindrical body

(14) projects inwards over the cylindrical envelope surface
(25) formed around the said longitudinal axis (23) by the 

parts (15) of the flanging rollers (10) which shape the flange
geometry.
Device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the delimiting bodies (17) are of stationary or rotatable

construction.
Device as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the delimiting bodies (17) are cylindrical.
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised
in that between each pair of adjacent flanging rollers (10)

there is provided at least one delimiting body (17).
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 5, characterised
in that the delimiting bodies (17) are rotatably mounted

rollers.
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 6, characterised
in that the longitudinal axes (18) of the delimiting rollers

(17) lie on a circle (19).
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 7,
characterised in that the delimiting rollers (17) are disposed,

preferably in guide pieces (20) or by an eccentric mounting,
so as to be displaceable in the sense of altering the distance

of their longitudinal axes (18) from the central longitudinal
axis (23) of the device.
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 8, characterised
in that the rollers (10, 17) can be driven, preferably in such

a way that the relative speed between the working surface of
the delimiting rollers (17) and the edge of the flange (B) is

zero in order to avoid damage.
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 9, characterised 
in that the delimiting bodies, preferably the delimiting

rollers (17) are disposed in such a way that their working
surfaces are at right angles to the inclination of the flange

(B).
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 10,
characterised in that the flanging rollers (10) and delimiting

rollers (17) are mounted in a common receptacle (22) which is
rotatable about a central axis (23) which coincides with the

axis of the cylindrical body (14).
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 11,
characterised in that the flanging rollers (10) are disposed,

preferably in guide pieces (20) or by an eccentric mounting,
so as to be displaceable in the sense of altering the distance

of their axes of rotation (11) from the central longitudinal
axis (23).
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 12,
characterised in that the delimiting bodies (17) are

preferably shaped so that they can effect an additional
shaping of the flange.
