<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for determining an analyte in a sample liquid by binding the analyte to a receptor R1 which is capable of specific binding to the analyte and which is immobilised on a particulate support material located in the sample liquid, which is characterised in that the sample liquid additionally contains a soluble receptor R2 which is capable of specific binding to the analyte and which has at least two binding sites for the analyte. The invention furthermore relates to a reagent for carrying out the abovementioned method.

Method for the determination of an analyte in a
sample liquid by binding the analyte to a receptor

R
1
 which is capable of specific binding to the
analyte via R
1a
 and R
1b
 to at least two different
epitopes on the analyte and is immobilized on a

particulate carrier material located in the sample
liquid and detecting the agglutination caused by

binding of the analyte and the receptor R
1
 by
nephelometric and turbidimetric methods,

wherein

the sample liquid additionally contains a soluble
receptor R
2
 which is capable of specific binding to
the analyte and has at least two binding sites for

the analyte.
Method as claimed in claim 1,

wherein

the sample liquid in addition contains a non-ionic
polymer from the group comprising dextran with a

molecular weight of at least 500 kD, polyvinylpyrrolidone
with a molecular weight of at least

10 kD and polyethylene glycol with a molecular
weight of at least 6 kD.
Method as claimed in claim 1,

wherein

the particulate carrier material is selected from
latex particles, metal sols and liposomes. 
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3,
wherein

the soluble receptor R
2
 is chosen in such a way
that the binding of R
2
 to the analyte does not
interfere with the binding of the immobilized

receptor R
1
 to the analyte.
Reagent for carrying out a method for the
determination of a bindable analyte in a sample

liquid and detecting the agglutination caused by
the binding of the analyte and a receptor R
1
 by
nephelometric or turbidimetric methods,

wherein

it contains at least one receptor R
1
 which is
capable of specific binding to the analyte and via

R
1a
 and R
1b
 to at least two different epitopes on
the analyte and is immobilized on a particulate

carrier material, and in addition contains a
receptor R
2
 which is capable of specific binding to
the analyte, is soluble in the sample liquid and

has at least two binding sites for the analyte.
Reagent as claimed in claim 5,

wherein

it in addition contains a non-ionic polymer from
the group comprising dextran with a molecular

weight of at least 500 kD, polyvinylpyrrolidone
with a molecular weight of at least 10 kD and

polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of at
least 6 kD. 
Reagent as claimed in claim 5 or 6,

wherein

the carrier material is selected from the group
comprising latex particles, metal sols and

lipoaomes.
Use of the combination of a receptor R
1
 which is
immobilized on a particulate carrier material via

R
1a
 and R
1b
 and which is capable of specific binding
to at least two different epitopes on the analyte

and a soluble receptor R
2
 provided with at least
two binding sites, wherein

R
1
 and R
2
 are both capable of specific binding to
an analyte, in order to avoid or/and reduce the

hook effect as an interference in the determination
of an analyte by immumoprecipitation and detection

of the agglutination caused by binding of the
analyte and the receptor R
1
 by nephelometric and
turbidimetric methods.
