<CLAIMS>
Automatic control gear having planetary gearings (2, 3), 
having clutches (18, 19) and multiple-disc-type brakes 

(16, 17), of which at least one brake (16) comprises a 
single disc as a lining disc (4) between two opposing 

discs (5, 6) and the brake (16) is operated by means of a 
brake piston (9), characterized in that a separate 

spring-like device (7) is clamped between the two discs 
(5, 6) enclosing the lining disc (4) and presses said two 

discs (5, 6) towards the closing device of the brake 
piston (9) onto stops (8). 
Automatic control gear according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the lining disc is the inner disc 

(4) and the two discs enclosing said disc between them 
are the outer discs (5, 6). 
Automatic control gear according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the spring-like device takes the 

form of a cup spring (7). 
Automatic control gear according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a stop is formed by a snap ring 

(8). 
Automatic control gear according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the brake piston (9) takes the form 

of an annular body. 
Automatic control gear according to claim 5, 
characterized in that the brake piston (9) takes the form 

of a sheet-metal ring. 
Automatic control gear according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the brake piston (9) is provided 

with at least one seal (11).  
 
Automatic control gear according to claim 7, 
characterized in that the seal (11) has an upper and a 

lower sealing lip (12, 13). 
Automatic control gear according to one of claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that the inner part (10) of the brake 

piston (9) is of a spring-elastic construction. 
Automatic control gear according to claim 9, 
characterized in that the inner part (10) of the brake 

piston (9) is constructed in the manner of a cup spring. 
Automatic control gear according to one of claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that the brake piston (9) is guided 

in a cylinder (14) of the housing, the cylinder (14) 
being connected to a bore (15) for the supply of pressure 

medium.
