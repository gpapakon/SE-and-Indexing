<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are devices for influencing and/or controlling relative motion between members, such as vibration damping or absorbing devices, clutches and brakes. The devices comprise a magnet (18) on one member (14) and a field cooled superconductor (15) on the other member (10). The devices utilize the interaction of the magnetic field of the magnet as it moves through the pinned flux in the superconductor (15) to either influence or control relative motion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement of two members in which
momentum is transferred
from one member to the other member as the members move relative
to one another according to the preamble of claim 1.The document US-A-4,886,778 discloses a superconducting rotating
assembly which includes a floating, unsupported and stable
rotor. The rotor includes a magnetic pole at each of its extremities,
each pole resting in a bearing. The polar axis of each
pole is colinear with the rotating axis of the rotor. A temperature
bath is provided for maintaining the bearings at or below
their critical superconducting temperature, and a motive
mechanism provides for rotation of the rotor. Each magnet pole
is thereby levitated and adapted to rotate in a stable, non-contacting
position by the field and pinning effects generated
by the associated bearing. In the conventional apparatus, the
arrangement of the bearing is such that no change in the polarity
of flux occurs under rotation of the rotor. This is important
as it avoids the imposition of displacement torques on the
rotating magnets which would tend to cause the rotor to become
unstable.The document US-A-5,071,831
showing all of the features of the preamble of claim 1
discloses superconductive gears and
clutches which exhibit no contact and which incorporate high-Tc
superconducting ceramic compositions. The devices can have two
discs of selected proportion, coupled to each other by a controllable
magnetic field so as to transmit the desired torque
in a given application, wherein the discs are composed of superconductive
material. Such devices are useful in ultra-high
speed rotational apparatus. Many types of prior-art devices exist for controlling or
influencing relative motion between two or more bodies. For
example, vibration damping systems, brakes and clutches are
well known and generally utilize mechanical type of apparatus
that are subject to wear, noise, vibration and friction heating
problems. These problems can often lead to seizure or other
failure of the apparatus. For example, springs 
or shock absorbers utilized in conventional vibrational
control systems tend to wear out with repeated usage
over time. Brake pads and mechanical clutches
ultimately wear out, and have to be periodically
replaced. In additional, mechanical systems often
require lubricants which fail in severe environments
such as those commonly encountered in outer space.
Failure of conventional liquid lubricants in outer
space is usually due to the vacuum conditions that
cause the

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement of two members in which momentum is
transferred from one member to the other member and the

members move relative to one another, comprising:

magnet means (4, 7, 11, 53) affixed to one (1, 12, 52) of
the members and having a magnetic field profile; and
a superconductor (5, 15, 57) which is affixed to the other
member (2, 12, 58) and which has been field cooled in the

presence of a magnetic field, thereby pinning the magnetic
flux profile;

wherein, as the one member is moved past the other member,
the magnetic field profile of the magnet means (4, 7, 11,

53) will move through the pinned magnetic flux profile, so
as to cause momentum to be transferred between the members,

characterized in that
the magnetic field profile of the magnet means (4, 7, 11,
53) is of non-uniform field strength in that it changes

along a direction corresponding to the relative movement of
the two members.
The arrangement of Claim 1, wherein the superconductor
has been field cooled in the presence of the magnetic

field profile of the magnet means (4, 7, 11, 53)
affixed to the first member (1, 12, 52).
The arrangement of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the
superconductor (5, 15, 57) is a type II

superconductor.
The arrangement of Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
superconductor (5, 15, 57) comprises a copper oxide.
The arrangement of Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
superconductor (5, 15, 57) comprises a 123 high

temperature superconductor.
The arrangement of any one of the Claims 1 to 5, wherein
the superconductor (5, 15, 57) is field cooled in the

presence of a magnetic field having a checkerboard
pattern.
The arrangement of any one of the Claims 1 to 6, wherein
one member comprises a clutch plate (65) and the other

member comprises a clutch pad (66).
