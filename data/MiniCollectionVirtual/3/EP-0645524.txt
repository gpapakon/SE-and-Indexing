<ABSTRACT>
Valve stem seal intended to be pushed onto a valve stem guide (8) held in the cylinder head (12) of an internal combustion engine, comprising a reinforcing tube (26) which is connected at one end to a first sealing lip (30) of annular design made of flexible material and, at the other end, ends in a radially outward-projecting first flange (18) which can be supported on the cylinder head (12). The reinforcing tube (26) is connected to a second sealing lip (34) made of flexible material which projects beyond the first flange in the axial direction and the second sealing lip (34) is at a radial distance from the valve stem guide (8) and can be brought into engagement with the annular surface of the cylinder head which surrounds the valve stem guide.

A seal arrangement with a valve stem seal for 
pushing onto a valve stem guide (8) held in the cylinder 

head (12) on an internal combustion engine, comprising a 
reinforcing tube (26) which is connected at one end to a 

first sealing lip (30) of annular design made of flexible 
material and ends at the other end in a radially outward-projecting 

first flange (18) which can be supported on the 
cylinder head (12), the reinforcing tube (26) being 

connected to a second sealing lip (34) made of flexible 
material which projects beyond the first flange (18) in the 

axial direction, the second sealing lip (34) being at a 
radial distance from the valve stem guide (8) and being 

capable of being brought into engagement with an annular 
surface of the cylinder head (12) surrounding the valve stem 

guide (8), an additional sealing element (28) of annular 
design being provided at at least one location of the 

reinforcing tube (26) between the first and the second 
sealing lips (30, 34), the sealing element (28) being 

capable of being brought into engagement with a radially 
outward-facing boundary surface of the valve stem guide (8), 

and the first and the second sealing lips (30, 34) and the 
sealing element (28) being designed to merge integrally into 

one another, characterized in that the sealing element (28) 
ends in a hollow-conically tapered surface at the end facing 

the flange (18) and in that the hollow-conically tapered 
surface has an inside diameter which is widened in the 

direction of the first flange (18). 
A seal arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the end of the valve stem guide (8) 

which faces the valve stem seal in the push-on direction is 
designed with a conical taper.  

 
A seal arrangement according to either of claims 
1 and 2, characterize
d in that the sealing element (28) is 
bounded on the inside by at least one radially inward-projecting 

sealing bead (36) of annular design and in that 
the sealing bead (36) can be brought into engagement with 

the radially outward-facing boundary surface of the valve 
stem guide (8). 
A sealing arrangement according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the reinforcing tube 

(26) is provided with a radially inward-projecting second 
flange at the end facing away from the first flange (18) and 

in that the first sealing lip (30) is fixed by its base to 
the inward-facing end of the profile of the second flange 

(18).
