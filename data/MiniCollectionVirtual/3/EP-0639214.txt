Method for processing lignite for use in combined gas/steam cycles in an indirectly 
heated drying oven of a steam generation plant, wherein the energy for the drying oven is 

provided by saturated steam from a waste heat boiler coupled to the combined gas/steam 
cycle, 


characterized in that
, 
the drying oven (1) is operated in direct connection with a pressurized vortex furnace (4), 
a gas turbine (12), a steam turbine (5), an air-heated steam reheater (13) and a waste heat 

boiler (17), that the energy carried by the exhaust vapors, which are cleaned of dust and at 
medium pressure, is used to evaporate a portion of the feedwater flow and that the gas 

turbine (12) is operated using waste gases from the pressurized vortex furnace (4), that 
steam reheating is carried out using compressed combustion air which cools in the process 

and the condensate from the exhaust vapors which form in the closed energy system is 
treated and used to supply water to the cyclic process. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the vapor condensate yielded is, 
without further processing, used as service water in the processing of ash/ash retention 

substance to be utilized as building materials. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the dry coal obtained in the closed 
energy system is burned in the pressurized vortex furnace (4) of the steam boiler (4) with 

excess air in the range 2
