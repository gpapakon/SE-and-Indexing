<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer image-receiving sheet comprising 
a substrate sheet, a dye-receptive layer provided on one 

surface of the substrate sheet and a dye-unreceptive 
layer provided on the other surface of the substrate 

sheet, the dye-unreceptive layer comprising a composition 
composed mainly of at least one thermoplastic resin 

having at least one reactive functional group and an 
isocyanate compound or a chelate compound. 
A thermal transfer image-receiving sheet comprising 
a substrate sheet (1), a dye-receptive layer (2) provided on one 

surface of the substrate sheet and a dye-unreceptive 

layer (3) provided on the other surface of the substrate 
sheet, the dye-unreceptive layer comprising a release 

agent which is the same as that contained in the dye-receptive 
layer or does not migrate to other places, for 

example, comprises an amino-modified silicone and an 
epoxy-modified silicone or a product of a reaction of 

both of them, or an addition-polymerizable silicone or a 
cured product obtained by a reaction thereof. 
A thermal transfer image-receiving sheet 
comprising a substrate sheet, a dye-receptive layer 

provided on one surface of the substrate sheet and a 
lubricious back surface layer provided on the other 

surface of the substrate sheet, the lubricious back 
surface layer being composed mainly of a binder and a 

nylon filler.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal transfer
image-receiving sheet which is receptive to a dye
transferred from a thermal transfer sheet by heating,
which thermal transfer image-receiving sheet can be
widely utilized in the field of various color printers
including video printers.In recent years, a system where video images, TV
images and still images, such as computer graphics, are
directly printed as a full color image has advanced,
which has led to a rapid expansion of the market thereof.Among others, a system which has attracted
attention is such that a sublimable dye as a recording
material is put on an image-receiving sheet and heated by
means of a thermal head in response to recording signals
to transfer the dye onto the image-receiving sheet,
thereby forming a recorded image.In this recording system, since a dye is used as
the colorant, the sharpness is very high and, at the same
time, the transparency is excellent, so that it is
possible to provide an image having excellent
reproduction and gradation of intermediate colors
equivalent to those of an image formed by the
conventional full color offset printing and gravure
printing. In this case, the formed image has a high
quality comparable to photographic images.Printers in current use in the above thermal
transfer system are mainly of such a type that a thermal
transfer image-receiving sheet is automatically carried
to a thermal transfer section within a printer and, after
printing, automatically delivered from the printer.
Further, in order to carry out overlap printing of three
colors or four colors, it is a common practice to provide
a detection mark on the thermal transfer image-receiving
sheet in its image-unreceptive surface, that is, the back 
surface, located opposite to the image-receiving surface
for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of a shear
in the printing position of each color.Not only the construction of the thermal transfer
sheet but also the construction of the image-receiving
sheet on which an image is to be formed is important to
the practice of the above thermal transfer method with a
high efficiency. In particular, the properties of the
image-unreceptive surface (back surface) located opposite
to the image-receptive surface of the thermal transfer
image-receiving sheet are important for smoothly carrying
out automatic feed and delivery of the thermal transfer
image-receiving sheet.For example, when the image-receiving sheets with
an image being formed thereon are put on top of another
for storage, the dye on
