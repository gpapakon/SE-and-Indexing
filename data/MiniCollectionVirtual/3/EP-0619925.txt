<DESCRIPTION>
 INTEGRATOR HAVING SWITCHED HYSTERESIS FOR PROXIMITY SWITCHESThis invention relates to a combined integrator and level detector circuit with switched hysteresis and temperature compensation, which is suitable for implementation in an integrated circuit. This configuration is usable in sensors and in particular, inductive proximity switches.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided proximity switch including an integrator arranged to provide a supplementary current source which is responsive to an output from a sensing circuit of the proximity switch to provide switched hysteresis.According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided an integrator with switched hysteresis for inductive proximity switches comprising a reference current source connected between a reference voltage supply rail and a first side of a current mirror, a second side of the current mirror being connected to a proximity switch rectifier, the first side of the current mirror further being connected with a capacitor and also to one input of a two input comparator, the other input of the comparator being held at a threshold level, wherein a fixed hysteresis current source is provided in parallel with the reference current source, the fixed hysteresis current source producing a switchable current which is a fixed proportion of th current of the reference current source, the fixed hysteresis current source being switched on (off) when a target is detected and off (on) when no target is detected.The reference current source may be provided by a current mirror comprising two transistors having a predetermined area ratio.The hysteresis current source may be provided by a second output of the reference current mirror comprising a third transistor having an n:l area ratio wi h a first of the two t ansistors, wl.arein n is any number.Emitter resistors may be provided on an input side and/or a output side of the current mirrors, which permits large current ratios to be achieved without the cost of larger transistor area ratios. This also allows the temperature coefficient to be 

 preset in magnitude and direction to offset the intrinsic temperature coefficient of the sensor disclosed in co-pending GB 9127570.1.The comparator may have a first output used to drive an output from the sensor.The comparator may further have a second output which controls a switch which is used to switch the detection hysteresis current on or off.The comparator may have a third output which modifies the comparator threshold to
