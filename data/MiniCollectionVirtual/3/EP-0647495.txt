the tack welded portions being done thereafter. In the welding deformation reducing method according to the present 
invention used when one-side strap joint welding is carried out, when not less than three welding electrodes are used, 

when Qi is welding heat input of each electrode which is determined on the basis of amperage, voltage and speed and 
Li the distance between a first electrode and each electrode, and when a maximum value H of the height of a tacked 

bead is set to be not more than a half of the thickness of the steel plates to be welded, the welding conditions are 
determined so that a value of a parameter 


P (P = 1/H ΣQi/(Li + k))

In order to carry out tack welding using a tab plate as well, P is set not higher than a predetermined level, and the 

height Ht of tack welded bead of a tab plate not more than a half of the thickness of the steel plates to be welded, the 
welding conditions being determined so that Ptab obtained by substituting the resultant values for H has a value not 

less than a predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of reducing
welding distortion in one side welding for joining plates.
More particularly, the present invention provides a method of
reducing welding distortion in one side welding for joining
plates, by which welding distortion is reduced when welding
is executed under optimal welding conditions in multi-electrode
welding.According to the prior art, the following one side
welding methods for joining plates are provided. As shown in
Fig. 2, steel plates 1, 1' to be welded are butted against
each other, and a tack-welded bead, the height of which is
the same as the wall thickness of the plates to be welded, is
provided in a groove, especially in a groove of the end
portion of welding. Alternatively, a tab, the thickness of
which is the same as the wall thickness of the plates to be
welded, is tack-welded at the end portion of welding so that
the height of the bead can be the same as the wall thickness.
In this way, the steel plates 1, 1' to be welded are
sufficiently bound before the start of welding so as to
reduce welding distortion. Alternatively, the following
method is provided, in which the plates to be welded are
heated by means of gas burners in the process of welding, so
that the thermal history is controlled for reducing welding
distortion. However, according to the conventional methods
in which a high restraining force is applied to the steel
plates to be welded using the tack-welded bead or tab, a
heavy burden is imposed for preparation before the start of
welding, and further it is necessary to repair the plates
after the completion of welding, which causes a problem from
the viewpoint of enhancing the efficiency of welding. Also,
the method of controlling the thermal history using gas 
burners is disadvantageous in that the welding apparatus
becomes large and it is difficult to enhance the welding
efficiency.According to the prior art for reducing welding
distortion in one side welding for joining plates, it is a
primary object to prevent the occurrence of end cracks which
occur at the end of a welded bead in the process of welding.
Ando et al. disclosed that these end cracks were caused by
welding distortion in the process of welding (Magazine of
Welding Society Vol. 30(1970), NO. 8, P792). After that,
various investigations were made to investigate the
distribution of stress caused in the process of welding (Sato
et al.: Theses of Japanese Ship Building Society, Vol. 136
(1974), P441, and Fujita et al.: Theses of Japanese Ship
Building Society,
