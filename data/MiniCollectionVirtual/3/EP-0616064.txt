cam parts for knitting, tucking and stitch transfer, characterised in that the 
beginning or the end of a new yarn (13, 120) used in a knitted blank, in particular 

an intarsia panel, to be secured is worked into loops or stitches in the region of the 
edge of the knitted panel with needles of both needle beds, wherein, in successive 

carriage strokes, after crossover of both shanks of at least one loop (19, 131) or 
stitch formed on a first needle bed, this loop or stitch is transferred over the 

crossover yarn section (18, 135) to a needle of a second needle bed. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that, after the loop (19) or stitch 
transferred to the second needle bed, a second loop (21) or second stitch is 

additionally transferred over another crossover yarn section (20). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that, after the transfer of the loop 
(131) or stitch to the second needle bed crossing over a yarn section, a loop (133) 

or stitch formed on an adjacent needle in the first needle bed is provided with an 
additional stitch (139) or loop and this double formation is then transferred to an 

adjacent needle (115) of the second needle bed again over a crossover yarn 
section.
