<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dispensing valve
used in fluid dispensing systems for dispensing fluid from a
container containing fluid or for providing an in-line
connection.Various types of dispensing valves or control valves,
such as fluid dispensing valves, have been used in the past
in connection with the fluid dispensing systems for
dispensing and controlling fluid flow.One use of dispensing valves is with collapsible
containers or flexible bags for dispensing fluid from the
containers. A fitment is typically provided in the opening
of the container for allowing attachment of the dispensing
valve to the container, yet other uses of dispensing valves
include in-line connections wherein the valve interconnects
two fluid passageways.With respect to the dispensing valve industry, a major
concern is minimizing the cost to manufacture the dispensing
valves. Another concern is to find a way to easily open the
fluid passageway to dispense fluid or close the fluid
passageway as desired and not spill any fluid. Yet another
concern is to vent the container as fluid is being withdrawn.Us-A-5031662 discloses a quick connect assembly for
beverage dispensation which includes a receptor valve
assembly and insert valve assembly. The insert valve
assembly includes a sleeve but this is not receivable within
a hollow insert in the receptor valve assembly. In use, the
insert valve assembly and receptor valve assembly are brought
axially together and tightened by a nut on the receptor valve
assembly.US-A-4421146 discloses a quick connect assembly for
beverage dispensation which can be removably connected to a
spout on a container. US-A-3625251 discloses a quick-connect valve hydraulic
coupling in which telescoping components are engaged and
disengaged by rotating them with respect to each other.While the above noted and other dispensing valves
provided in the art have some extent met the need in the art
for dispensing fluid, it is clear that there has existed and
still is an unfilled need in the art for an improved, cost
effective and reliable dispensing valve. The present
invention provides an improved dispensing valve.The present invention relates to a dispensing valve
having a receptor valve assembly and an insert valve
assembly, both defining a fluid passage therein.Thus viewed from one aspect the present invention
provides a valve assembly, comprising:
a receptor valve assembly defining a normally closed
fluid passage;an insert valve assembly defining a normally closed
fluid passage;the insert and receptor
