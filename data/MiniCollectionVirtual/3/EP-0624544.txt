<ABSTRACT>
A platform (1) is equipped with a chair (3), which chair is 
displaceable 

along a mast (2), and to which chair platform components (1-1,1-2) can 
be affixed, whereby, force indication means (9) are incorporated 

between the chair (3) and the platform components (1-1,1-2) so that an 
indication 

can be provided concerning the differences in the mechanical 
loading of the platform components located at opposite sides of 

the chair. 
A simple embodiment arises through the application of a beam (8) 
which is freely-spanned with respect to the chair (3) and which is 

connected in a hinged manner with the platform components (1-1,1-2), 
within which beam force indication means (9) are incorporated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The current invention pertains to a platform equipped with a
chair, which chair is displaceable along a mast, to each side of
which platform a platform component can be affixed, via two
fixing points located above each other and embodied in a hinged
manner, whereas a beam which is freely spanned with respect to
the chair is fixed between the corresponding lowest hinged fixing
points of the platform components and force indication means are
fitted at least between one of the platform components and the
chair.Such platforms, also referred to as scaffold-lifts, are
generally known from NL-A-8603300. Known lift-scaffolds,
scaffoldings and working platforms, which are mobile and which
can be assembled in situ from modular sections or parts, are
often placed adjacent to or against buildings or walls as an aid
to building, repair or maintenance duties. Under such
circumstances, a load with personnel is placed on the platform,
which load and personnel are subsequently displaced on the
platform alongside the mast.
In operation of the known platforms circumstances are imaginable
in which such forces exist that danger to material or persons
cannot be ruled out.In order to mitigate said danger, the platform according to
NL-A-8603300 is provided with indication means fitted at least
between one of the platform components and the chair.The advantage thereof is that said force indication means
provide an indication of the forces arising between the platform
component and the chair, which, in their turn, exert a torque or
bending force on the mast. The indication provides the
possibility of warning when a mechanical overloading or imbalance
occurs in the platform as a result of an excessive loading of one
side of the mast, which overloading or imbalance could lead to
dangerous situations.A disadvantage of the known platform resides in the fact that
the force indication means due to their rather complicated and 
expensive embodiment do not garantee a precise and stable
operation over extended periods of use. The aim of the present
invention is to obviate the mentioned disadvantages and to
provide a platform with simple and reliable force indication
means. In order to achieve this, the platform according to the
present invention is characterized in that the beam is equiped
with a block with a boring within which boring a blocking pin
protruding from the chair is fixed, whereas the force indication
means are positioned between the block and a part fixed to the
beam. In this manner a very reliable and inexpensive

<CLAIMS>
Platform equiped with a chair (3), which chair (3) is
displaceable along a mast (2) to each side of which chair (3)

a platform component (1-1, 1-2) can be affixed via two fixing
points (7-2, 7-4; 7-1, 7-3) located above each other and

embodied in a hinged manner, whereas a beam (8) which is
freely-spanned with respect to the chair (3) is fixed between

the corresponding lowest hinged fixing points (7-3, 7-4) for
the platform components and force indication means (9) are

fitted at least between one of the platform components and
the chair, characterised in that the beam (8) is provided

with a block (10), which is movable with respect to the beam,
with a boring (11) within which boring a blocking pin (12)

protruding from the chair (3) is fixed, whereas the force
indication means (9) are positioned between the block (10)

and a part fixed to the beam (8).
Platform according to claim 1, characterised in that
elastic means (13) are provided between the block (10) and

the force indication means (9) in order to pre-tense the
force indication means.
Platform according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that the beam (8) is equiped with striking means (14,15)

which limit the degree of movement of the beam (8) with
respect to the block (10).
