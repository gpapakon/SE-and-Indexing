<ABSTRACT>
The device serves to couple a cable (10) of a lifting device to a precast concrete unit (2). It has a rotatably mounted receptacle (1) for the cable (10). The receptacle (1) is supported with a tie rod (6) on the surface (2') of the precast unit. A curved section located on the receptacle (1) as well as deflection surfaces (11, 11') are provided for guiding and deflecting the cable so that the cable (10) is guided away from the surface (2') of the precast unit towards the lifting device. This configuration ensures that the parts of the device which are encased in concrete are relieved of transverse forces which occur during lifting of the load.

Arrangement for connecting a cable of a lifting device to 
a finished part, especially a precast concrete part, with a 

holder for the cable, which holder is supported and mounted to 
rotate on the surface of the finished part by a tie-rod, 

characterised in that the holder (1) is constructed to rest on 
the finished part surface (2) and a section (7) located on the 

holder (1) is arranged for the guidance of the cable (10), which 
section is provided at least approximately parallel to the 

surface (2') of the finished part (2) and directly beside the 
latter. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the holder (1) is constructed as a plate and the section (7) for 

the guidance of the cable (10) is curved. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that at right angles to its flat bottom surface 

(4), the holder (1) comprises a bore (5) for receiving the tie-rod 
(6). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the cable guidance section (7) is provided 

centrally with respect to the bore (5) on the periphery of the 
plate (1) and is constructed at least approximately over an angle 

of 180Â° on the approximately semi-circular or semi-oval plate. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that offset with respect to the axis (5') of the 

bore (5), means (11, 11') are provided for deflecting the cable 
(10) from the direction parallel to the surface (2') of the 

finished part (2) upwards in the outer pulling direction. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that at the two end regions (7a) of the cable 

guidance section (7), the plate (1) comprises deflection surfaces  
 

(11, 11') so that the cable (10) is guided away from the finished 
part surface (2') upwards in the direction of the lifting device. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the upwardly directed deflection surfaces 

(11, 11') are provided at the ends of a cross-piece (9) lying 
above the cable guidance section (7). 
Arrangement according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
the cross-piece (9) is located on the upper side of the plate (1) 

and is constructed in one piece with the latter and projects 
beyond the opposing end regions (7a) of the cable guidance 

section (7) and that furthermore provided respectively on the 
under side of the two projecting parts of the cross-piece (9) are 

the upwardly curved deflection surfaces (11, 11') as well as 
boundary surfaces (15, 15') preceding the latter and ensuring the 

guidance of the cable. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the centres (24) of the deflection surfaces 

(11, 11') leading upwards are offset with respect to the axis 
(5') of the bore (5). 
Arrangement according to Claim 9, characterised in that 
the closure edges (16, 16') of the deflection surfaces (11, 11') 

lie parallel to the diameter (7'), which defines the semi-circle 
of the cable guidance section (7). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the cable guidance section (7) is 

constructed as a tunnel-like recess (17) in the plate (1) so that 
the cable (10) is held in the recess (17) in a form-locking 

manner. 
Arrangement according to Claim 11, characterised in that 
the tunnel-like recess (17) is guided to the bottom surface (4) 

of the plate-like holder (1) and at the lower end is constructed  
 

as a support surface (18). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that a preferably thin-walled cover (12) is 

provided between the plate (1) and the finished part surface 
(2'). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that at an angle with respect to the bore (5), 

the plate (1) comprises an additional bore (13) for receiving a 
locking pin (14). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that for one and the same threaded sleeve (19), 

tie-rods of different diameter can be used, in which case tie-rods 
with a smaller diameter are provided with corresponding 

adjusting pieces (23) and the adjusting pieces comprise an 
annular recess (22) for a locking pin (14).
