A rolling mandrel monitoring system for cold 
pilger rolling mills with a coil (17) located on the 

outlet side after the rolling mill and concentrically 
surrounding the rolled tube (5) for detecting the 

longitudinal movement of a coil core (15) fastened 
within the tube (5) on a rod (6) extending between the 

mandrel (2) and coil (17) coaxially to the tube (5) and 
means for processing the detected movement of the core 

(15) in the coil (17) to produce a signal by means of 
which the rolling mill can be shut down,
 
characterised in that the rod is connected, passing 

concentrically through the mandrel (2), to the mandrel 
rod (3) holding the mandrel (2) and is designed as a 

tension rod (6) in the region of the mandrel (2), which 
tension rod can be pre-tensioned against the outlet-side 

end face of the mandrel (2) with the interposition 
of an energy accumulator (14). 
A rolling mandrel monitoring system according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that the tension rod (6) is 

provided with a predetermined breaking point (7). 
A rolling mandrel monitoring system according to 
Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the initial 

tension of the energy accumulator (14) is adjustable. 
A rolling mandrel monitoring system according to 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the energy 

accumulator (14) is a pressure spring which is located 
in a sleeve (12) surrounding the rod, the position of 

which sleeve can be fixed relative to the rod by 
turning the sleeve (12) on a threaded section (11) of 

the rod.  
 
A rolling mandrel monitoring system according to 
Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the tension rod 

(6) is guided non-rotationally in a bush (8) which can 
be screwed on the end face into the outlet-side end of 

the mandrel (2), the free end face of which bush forms 
the abutment for the pressure spring (14) and the 

sleeve (12). 
A rolling mandrel monitoring system according to 
Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the tension rod 

(6) is provided with a collar (18) on the side of the 
predetermined breaking point (7) remote from the 

mandrel rod (3), the diameter of which is greater than 
the internal diameter of the bush (8) guiding the 

tension rod (6). 
A rolling mandrel monitoring system according to 
Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the tension rod 

(6) is designed to be square or hexagonal in cross-section 
over the predominant part of its length. 
A rolling mandrel monitoring system according to 
Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the position of 

the core (15) is adjustable in the longitudinal 
direction of the rod.
