<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical tensioner for a nut-bolt assembly has two input elements (2, 3) engaging with one another and engageable by an actuating tool so that the input elements (2, 3) are turnable relative to one another in opposite directions, one of the input elements (2) being engageable with a bolt (1) so that when the input elements (2, 3) are turned relative to one another the one engaging element (2) pulls the bolt (1) in an axial direction, an output element (5) engageable with a nut (0) so as to turn the nut (0), and a transmission (6, 8, 9) connecting the other input element (3) with the output element (5) so that when the other input element (3) is turned the output element (5) turns through the transmission (6, 8, 9) and thereby turns the nut (0). The transmission (6, 8, 9) is formed so that the output element (5) is turnable with a speed which is substantially greater than a speed of turning of said other input element (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to mechanical
tensioners.
In particular, the invention relates to a mechanical tensioner for
tensioning a nut and bolt
assembly and which does not remain on, but is removed from, an assembly once the
nut is tightened.In industry tensioners are known which use hydraulics to
elongate a bolt. Such tensioners basically include a hydraulic jack
that reacts on a sleeve around the nut and that is connected
to a stud portion which extends through the nut. An oval
opening in the sleeve allows an operator to turn the nut down
once the stud is elongated by means of a pin which connects
with holes in the side of the nut. There is also a known system
which, instead of having an oval opening in the sleeve, has
a gear mechanism that is turned, once the elongation of
the stud has been achieved, so as to exert a greater force when
the nut is turned. The one feature which all these tensioners
have in common is that they do not turn the nut down strongly
enough so as to avoid stud relaxation when the tensioner is
taken off. Another known tensioner
is disclosed in DE-A-2635678.
This tensioner incorporates a first and a second element, the first
element being hydraulically engageable so as to move in axial direction
of the bolt, the second element being engageable with the nut and the
first and second elements engaging with each other so that when the
first element is moved axially, the second element pulls the nut
and thereby the bolt in axial direction and turns the nut in
dependence on the friction torque between the nut and the surface
against which the nut is to be tightened. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a mechanical tensioner which avoids the
disadvantages of the prior art.In keeping with this object and with others which will
become apparent hereinafter, the present
invention resides in a mechanical tensioner as claimed in the
ensuing claim 1. A mechanical tensioner designed in accordance
with the present invention avoids the disadvantages of
the prior art. A significantly higher degree of tensioning
can be achieved, and bolt relaxation after the
tensioner is taken off is eliminated. At the same time, the tensioner can
be operated with a regular hydraulic torque tool.Preferred embodiments of
the invention are set forth in the
appended dependent claims. The invention, both as to
its construction and its method of operation, together with
additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best
understood from the following description of specific
embodiments
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mechanical tensioner for a nut-bolt assembly
(0,1), comprising a first and a second input element (2,3)

engaging with one another so as to move axially relative to one another
when being turned relative to one

another, wherein each input element (2,3) is engageable
by an actuating tool and wherein the first input element (2)

is engageable with the bolt (1) of the nut-bolt assembly,
so that when said input

elements are turned relative to one another the first input
element (2) does not turn but moves axially relative to the

second input element (3) so as to pull the bolt (1) in an
axial direction, and wherein the mechanical tensioner

further comprises an output element (5) engageable with the
nut (0) of the nut-bolt assembly to enable turning of said nut, and a transmission

(6-9) connecting the second input element (3) with said
output element (5) so that, when the second input element

(3) is turned, said output element (5) turns through said
transmission and thereby turns the nut (0), said

transmission (6-9) being formed so that said output element
(5) is turnable with a speed which is substantially greater

than a speed of turning of said second input element (3) and
including means (11) for providing for slip between the

output element (5) and the second input element (3) in
dependence on the transmitted torque.
A mechanical tensioner as defined in claim 1,
characterised in that said transmission is formed as a

planetary transmission.
A mechanical tensioner according to claim 1,
characterised in that said transmission includes a ring gear

(6) outwardly engaging said second input element (3), a
plurality of intermediate gears (8) inwardly engaging said

ring gear (6), and a sun gear (9) inwardly engaging said
intermediate gears (8) and also engaging said output element

(5).
A mechanical tensioner according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that said slip means

include means for periodically interrupting and establishing 
a connection between said second input element (3) and said

output element (5).
A mechanical tensioner according to claim 3 or
claim 4 when dependent upon claim 3, characterised in that

said slip means includes spring means (11) biasing said
output element (5) axially toward said sun gear (9) so that

when, during operation, a force of the spring means (11) is
overcome, engaging elements (9b) of the sun gear slip over

engaging elements (5a) of said output element (5) and do not
transmit turning from said sun gear (9) to said output

element (5).
