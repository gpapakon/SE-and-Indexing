<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for conducting in situ tests on a subsurface earth formation (11) of interest which is traversed by a wellbore (10). A wireline formation testing instrument (13) is positioned at formation depth by winding or unwinding cable (12) from hoist (20), and a sampling probe (18) thereof is extended into fluid communication with the formation (11) and isolated from wellbore pressure. The sampling and measuring instrument (13) is comprised of a hydraulic power system (14), a fluid sample storage section (15) and a sampling mechanism section (16). Utilizing a hydraulically energized double-acting bidirectional piston pump and by valve controlled selection of pumping direction, testing fluid such as completion fluid may be pumped into the formation through the sampling probe either from fluid reservoirs of the instrument or from the wellbore. After reversing the operating and control valving of the pump and instrument, the piston pump is utilized to extract formation fluid from the formation (11) and pump it to sample tanks of the instrument (13), pump it to the wellbore (10) or subject it to controlled pressure for real time formation testing and for formation characterization.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for subsurface formation
testing, and more particularly concerns methods and apparatus for providing real time
simultaneous measurements of the response to changes in pressure, volume and/or
temperature of fluid samples from subsurface earth formations traversed by a wellbore for
conducting in situ tests for determination of factors influencing potential formation
productivity and for acquiring connate fluid samples in sample tanks under conditions of
controlled pressure for subsequent laboratory analyses. Such in situ tests include
determination of fluid bubble point pressure at formation depth and under formation
conditions and determination of fluid compressibility and use of the same for reservoir
characterization by means of bubble point pressure and fluid compressibility profile plots.The sampling of fluids contained in subsurface earth formations provides a method
of testing formation zones of possible interest by recovering a sample of any formation fluids
present for later analysis in a laboratory environment while causing a minimum of damage
to the tested formations. The formation sample is essentially a point test of the possible
productivity of subsurface earth formations. Additionally, a continuous record of the
sequence of events during the test is made at the surface. From this record, valuable
formation pressure and permeability data as well as data determinative of fluid
compressibility and relative viscosity can be obtained for formation reservoir analysis.Early formation fluid sampling instruments such as the one described in U.S. Patent
No. 2,674,313 were not fully successful as a commercial service because they were limited
to a single test on each trip into the borehole. Later instruments were suitable for multiple
testing; however, the success of these testers depended to some extent on the characteristics
of the particular formations to be tested. For example, where earth formations were
unconsolidated, a different sampling apparatus was required than in the case of consolidated
formations.Down-hole multi-tester instruments have been developed with extensible sampling
probes for engaging the borehole wall at the formation of interest for withdrawing fluid 
samples therefrom and measuring pressure. In downhole instruments of this nature it is
typical to provide an internal draw-down piston which is reciprocated hydraulically or
electrically to increase the internal volume of a fluid receiving chamber within the instrument
