Removable fixing device (1) for a coil spring (5), said device 
comprising a fixing element (D, 3) formed in the prolongation of a body (C, 2), 

said body (2) being composed of a wire winding of a spring wire of contiguous 
convolutions whose outer diameter (Da
2
) is larger than the inner diameter (D
i
) 
of said coil spring, said fixing element (3) conforming to the same wire as said 

body, said device being intended to be screwed to an end of said coil spring (5)
 
   characterized in that
 
   the diameter of the spring wire (d
1
) constituting said device is 
greater than the diameter of the spring wire (d) constituting the coil spring. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the diameter of the 
spring wire (d
1
) constituting said device is between 110% and 130% of the 
diameter of the spring wire (d) constituting the coil spring. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the diameter of the 
spring wire (d
1
) constituting said device is substantially equal to 120% of the 
diameter of the spring wire (d) constituting the coil spring. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
it further comprises a lead-in portion (A), disposed at its end opposite that 

equipped with the fixing element (D), said lead-in portion being made up of at 
least one turn whose outer diameter (Da
1
) is less than the inner diameter (D
i
) of 
the coil (5). 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that it further comprises 
a transition portion (B) made up of at least two convolutions formed as a cone 

passing from the diameter (Da
1
) of the lead-in portion (A) to the diameter (Da
2
) 
of the body portion (C). 
Fixing device according to one of the preceding claims characterized 
in that it is manufactured of Class II DIN 17223/1 spring steel. 
Fixing device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that it is manufactured of Class C DIN 17223/1 spring steel.  

 
Fixing device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that it is manufactured of stainless spring steel DIN 17224. 
Coil spring (5) comprising at lest one fixing device (1) according to 
one of the preceding claims. 
Spring (5) according to claim 9, characterized in that its winding ratio 
(Dm/d) is between 4 and 12. 
Spring according to one of the claims 9 or 10, characterized in that 
its winding ratio (Dm/d) is substantially equal to 8.
