<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal device with little 
temperature-dependence of drive characteristics, such 

as response speed, and with good storage stability, 
can be produced by using a liquid crystal composition, 

successively assuming SmA (smectic A) phase and SmC* 
(chiral smectic) phase on temperature decrease. The 

layer spacing composition has a temperature-dependence 
of layer spacing 
d
 in smectic phase such that the 

layer spacing 
d
 increases, is constant or decreases on 
temperature decrease in SmA phase temperature range, 

assumes a first transition point where the layer 
spacing 
d
 abruptly decreases on temperature decrease 
in vicinity of transition temperature from SmA phase 

to SmC* phase, and assumes a second transition point 
where the layer spacing 
d
 commences to increase on 
further temperature decrease below the first 

transition point in SmC* temperature range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal composition, and a liquid crystal device and a
liquid crystal apparatus using the composition. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a
liquid crystal composition having improved
temperature-dependence of response speed and improved
drive characteristics, a liquid crystal device using
the composition and utilized for liquid crystal
display device, liquid crystal-optical shutter, etc.,
and a liquid crystal apparatus including the liquid
crystal device.Hitherto, a type of liquid crystal device,
particularly a ferroelectric liquid crystal device,
having bistability has been proposed by Clark and
Lagerwall (U.S. Patent No. 4,367,924, Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application (JP-A) 56-107216, etc.).A ferroelectric liquid crystal generally has
chiral smectic C phase (SmC*) or H phase (SmH*) in a
specific temperature range and, in the SmC* or SmH*
phase of a non-helical structure, shows a property of
assuming either one of a first optically stable state
and a second optically stable state responding to an
electric field applied thereto and maintaining such a 
state in the absence of an electric field, namely
bistability.In addition to the bistability, the
ferroelectric liquid crystal has an excellent
characteristic of a high-speed responsiveness. This
is because a switching between alignment states is
induced by a direct interaction between a spontaneous
polarization inherently owned by the ferroelectric
liquid crystal and an applied electric field. The
response speed is faster by 3 - 4 digits than that of
a TN-liquid crystal of which the switching between
alignment states is inclined by an interaction between
a dielectric anisotropy and an applied electric field.
Accordingly, a ferroelectric liquid crystal device is
expected to be widely utilized in a high speed and
memory type display device, and particularly to
provide a large-area, high resolution display because
of its function.In a liquid crystal device utilizing
birefringence of a liquid crystal, the transmittance
under right angle cross nicols is given by the
following equation:
I/I0 = sin24a·sin2(Δnd/λ) ,
wherein
I0:incident light intensity,I:transmitted light intensity,a:apparent tilt angle as defined
hereinafter, Δn:refractive index anisotropy,d:thickness of the liquid crystal layer,λ:wavelength of the incident light.
The apparent tilt angle a in the above-mentioned non-helical
structure is recognized as a half of an angle
between the average molecular axis directions of
liquid crystal
