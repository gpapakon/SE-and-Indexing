<ABSTRACT>
An anonymous trading system (Fig. 1) identifies the best bids and offers (QuoteSubmit, Fig. 3) from those counterparties (WS A1a1) with which each party (WS A1b1, WS A1b2, ... WS A2a2) is currently eligible to deal, while maintaining the anonymity of the potential counterparty and the confidentiality of any specific credit limitations imposed by the anonymous potential counterparty. To that end, each bid or offer (QuoteSubmit, Fig. 3) for a particular type of financial instrument is prescreened by the system for compatibility with limited credit information (for example, a one bit flag indicating whether a predetermined limit has already been exceeded) and an anonymous "Dealable" price (24, 26) is calculated for each of the traders (WS A1b, ... WS A2a) dealing with that particular financial instrument.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an electronic brokerage 
system having a communication network connecting traders dealing in 
financial instruments, and more particularly to a computerized system for 
distributing anonymous price quotes on a selective basis in accordance with 
previously established credit limits. European patent applications EP-A-0 399 850, 
EP-A-0 407 026, and EP-A-0 411 748 disclose an automated matching system for 
anonymous trading of foreign currencies (or other financial instruments) in 
which a single host computer maintains a central data base consisting of all 
the trading instruments available for trade, credit information, and the 
various bids and offers that are present throughout the system. The host 
computer uses the information in its central data base to match active bids 
and offers (as well as executing any transitory "hit bid" and "take offer" 
transactions) based on matching criteria which include the gross 
counterparty credit limit between counterparties to a potential matching 
transaction, price, and available quantity. To that end, each client site 
establishes and may subsequently vary or reset a credit limit for each 
possible counterparty, which is used by the host computer to establish the 
gross counterparty credit limit for each possible pair of parties and which is 
equal to the minimum of the remaining credit (initial credit limit less any 
applicable transactions that have already been executed) from the first party 
to the second party and from the second party to the first party. The host 
computer blocks completion of an otherwise eligible matching transaction 
between a given pair of potential counterparties when the transaction has 
an associated value in excess of the applicable gross credit limit. In that 
system, the various client site computers (keystations) merely maintain and 
display a restricted subset of the information available at the central  
 
computer, such as a predetermined number of the best bids and 
offers, and communicate credit and other transaction oriented 
information to the host computer for execution. However, in an 
attempt to preserve the anonymity of the parties, the client 
sites do not have access to any credit limits set by their 
possible counterparties, or even to the identification of any 
other party to a particular transaction until after a transaction 
has been completed. European patent application EP-A-0 512 702, which was 
published on 11.11.92 after the priority date of the present 
invention

<CLAIMS>
A computerized trading system for trading of financial instruments 
between traders trading at a plurality of trading floors, said system 

comprising 

a communication network for transmitting electronic messages, 
a plurality of trader terminals (WS) each associated with a respective one of 
said trading floors (MAN) and connected to the communication 

network, for 

generating electronic price quotation messages (QuoteSubmit) 
including bid and/or offer prices (46,48), and 
communicating selected bid and offer price information (24,26, 
18,20) based on price quotation messages (QuoteSubmit, 

QuoteAvailable, MarketView) originating from other said trading 
floors and received over the communication network, 
credit limit administration processing means (MAN, ARB) connected 
to the communication network, for automatically determining whether 

a predetermined level of credit is currently respectively available 
(CreditUpdate) from each trading floor to each of the other trading 

floors, and 
dealable price distribution processing means (MD) connected to said 
communication network and responsive to said price quotation 

messages (QuoteAvailable) as well as to said credit limit 
administration processing means (MAN, ARB) for automatically 

transmitting dealable price messages (MarketView) to the terminals 
(WS A1b1, WS A1b2) of at least one particular trading floor (MAN 

A1b), said dealable price messages (MarketView) being derived only 
from price quotation messages (QuoteSubmit) from those trading 

floors (MAN A1a) for which said credit limit administration processing 
means (ARB A, MAN A1a, MAN A1b) has determined that said 

predetermined level of credit is currently available on a bilateral basis  
 

both from and to said particular trading floor (MAN A1b). 
The trading system of claim 1, wherein said selected price information 
communicated by the terminal at said particular trading floor 

comprises dealable price information (24, 26) derived from said dealable 
price messages (MarketView). 
The trading system of claim 2, wherein said dealable price information 
(24,26) comprises the best price for a predetermined quantity ($5m) 

available from any of said trading floors (MAN) with which bilateral credit 
currently exists. 
The trading system of claim 3, wherein said dealable price information 
(24,26) is the best price for said predetermined quantity ($5m) available as 

a single quote from a single one of said trading floors (MAN) with which 
bilateral credit currently exists. 
The trading system of claim 3, wherein said dealable price information 
(24,26) is determined from the best prices for said predetermined quantity 

($5m) available on a composite price based on a plurality of quotes from one 
or more of said trading floors (MAN) with which bilateral credit currently 

exists. 
The trading system of claim 3, wherein said dealable price information 
further comprises the best price (24,26) for any quantity (28) available from 

at least one of said trading floors with which bilateral credit currently exists. 
The trading system of claim 6, wherein 

trades are possible for a small quantity (28) less than said predetermined 
quantity, and 
said terminal (WS) displays a price (24,26) applicable only to a small, 
but otherwise dealable, quantity (28) when said predetermined  

 
quantity is not available to the associated trading floor. 
The trading system of claim 1, wherein said dealable price information 
is communicated in the form of a visible display. 
The trading system of claim 1, wherein said dealable price information 
is communicated to at least one of the traders in the form of vocalized text. 
The trading system of claim 1, further comprising 

a plurality of access nodes (MAN) connected to the communication network, 
including a first access node (MAN A1a) associated only with a first 

trading floor and a second access node (MAN A2a) associated only 
with a second trading floor, for maintaining a record of all trades 

executed on behalf of an associated trading floor, and 
one or more distribution nodes (MD) connected to the communication 
network, 
 
wherein 


said access nodes (MAN) collectively comprise said credit limit administration 
processing means, 
said distribution nodes (MD) collectively comprise said dealable price 
distribution processing means, 
said access nodes transmit over the communication network to said 
distribution nodes credit update messages (CreditUpdate) which 

indicate whether said predetermined level of credit is currently 
available from one trading floor to another trading floor without 

indicating the extent of any credit currently remaining above said 
predetermined level, 
said dealable price distribution processing means maintains at each of said 
distribution nodes an ordered list (110) of at least those of said price 

quotation messages (QuoteSubmit) which are not yet withdrawn or 
reserved and a preauthorization matrix (PM) whose individual  

 
entries collectively indicate whether or not said predetermined level 

of credit is available on a bilateral basis between each of its respective 
trading floors and each of said plurality of trading floors, 
said dealable price information (108) is transmitted from each said 

distribution node to one or more of said access nodes for eventual 
transmission to associated ones of said terminals (WS), 
each said access node (MAN) is located on the premises of a respective 
trading floor (TF) and contains only credit information originating with 

said respective trading floor, 
said credit limit administration processing means transmits an electronic 
credit update message (CreditUpdate) to said distribution nodes (MD) 

whenever a predetermined minimum level of credit becomes available 
or is no longer available to a particular said trading floor, and 
said credit update message does not specify the amount of credit available. 
The trading system of claim 10, wherein those quotes which are for 
a price not worse than a particular said dealable price and which originate 

from a trading floor which has bilateral credit available with the trading floor 
associated with said particular dealable price are identified as "dealable 

quotes". 
The trading system of claim 11, wherein the record of executed trades 
maintained by each access node is used to automatically recover or rollback 

pending transactions which have been identified by another node as 
potential trades but which have not yet been fully executed or canceled. 
The trading system of claim 10, wherein 

said price quotation message (QuoteSubmit) includes designation of the 
trading floor (TF) from which the quotation originates, 
said trading floor designation (TF) is used by said each distribution node 
(MD) in deriving said dealable price messages (MarketView), and 
said dealable price message does not include any designation of the trader  
 

or trading floor from which the quotation originates, when received by 
any said market access node (MAN) or trader terminal (WS). 
The trading system of claim 10, wherein said current credit limit is 
derived from a predetermined maximum trade volume and the actual 

cumulative trade volume between said associated trading floor and one other 
trading floor dealing in a plurality of types of financial instruments. 
The trading system of claim 14, wherein said current credit limit is a 
combined limit applicable to a plurality of related trading floors. 
The trading system of claim 1, wherein said dealable price distribution 
processing means is responsive to unilateral credit update messages received
