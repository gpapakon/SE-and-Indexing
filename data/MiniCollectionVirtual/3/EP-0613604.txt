<ABSTRACT>
An inbuilding communication system is described for providing telephone communication between sets of portable telephone (58) located in different areas (13-15, 17-19) of a building (12 or 16), wherein each set of portable telephones is assigned a substantially identical set of frequencies. The various areas (13-15, 17-19) are separated by building structure which attenuates radio signals. Each area is provided with a set of at least two antennas (54-56, 64-66, 74-76, 94-96, 104, 106, 108, 114, 116, 118) the number and position of each antenna being chosen such that the radio signals transmitted from such antennas are attenuated below a predetermined level from passing through the attenuating structure. A selection circuit (52) is provided for selecting one antenna in each set for transmitting a selected radio signal, such antenna being selected to that which requires the lowest signal intensity for transmitting to the portable telephone in that area corresponding to a particular frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INBUILDING TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMThis invention relates to telephone communication systems, and more particularly, to a telephone communication system which allows the use of a plurality of portable telephones in a building.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe use of a portable telephone in a building allows the user a degree of mobility not available from using a telephone which is attached to a telephone jack using a cable. As a result, there is a high demand for portable telephones. Prior art portable telephones have a transceiver and an antenna for transmitting radio signals to and receiving radio signals from a base unit. The base unit is typically coupled to a wireline telephone central office. The base unit also has a transceiver and an antenna for transmitting and receiving radio signals. The radio signal provides the means for communicating between the portable telephone and the base unit, and subsequently to other telephones through the telephone central office.Even though there is a high demand for portable telephones, there is presently a limit on the number of portable telephones which can be utilized in a building. One of the limitations to the number of portable telephones is that the radio signal frequency spectrum assigned to portable telephones by regulatory agencies is limited. Effort has been made to better utilize this frequency spectrum.As an example, the frequency spectrum is divided into frequency channels having as narrow a band width as practical. Typically, each portable telephone is assigned one of these channels. Thus, the number of portable telephones is limited by the number of assignable channels. 

 One way to increase the number of portable telephones is to assign more than one portable telephone to the same frequency channel. However, one of the problems of such assignment is that there could be unacceptable interference between the portable telephones using the same channel. Interference occurs when the radio signal transmitted by one portable telephone affects the quality of the signal used by another portable telephone. Interference is especially significant when the intensity of the interfering signal is strong and is of substantially the same frequency as the signal which is interfered with.One way to reduce interference is by separating the portable telephones using the same frequency channel by a physical structure, such as the flooring separating one floor from another, which attenuates radio signals. If the radio signal passing through the structure is
