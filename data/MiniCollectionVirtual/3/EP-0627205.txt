Ankle brace, comprising a U-shaped sleeve joint (20)
with a web (22) of a flexible material proceeding

underneth the foot, in which the brace (10) is comprised
of a joint sleeve (20) with an outer ankle

splint (21) and an inner ankle splint (121), in which
case two ankle splints (21,121) are interconnected by

means of a web (22) proceeding underneath the heel
of the foot and, at the rear, while leaving the heel

and the Achilles heel tendon attachment uncovered,
by means of a wide strap (23) as well as on the front

side within its upper area, by means of at least one
strap band (25;25') variable in its length, and pos-sess

anatomically adapted and configures depressions,
and of a metatarsal portion (30) proceeding transversally

underneath the sole of the foot proximally to
the small condyles of the metatarsal bones I - V,

which, laterally and medially, engage around the edges
of the foot and form the connection for two cross

strap bands (40,140) and a transverse Strap band (50),
as well as being connected via the transverse strap

band (50),

characterized in that

a. the metatarsal portion (30), on the side of the
sole of the foot, is connected by a highly flexible

web (35) acting as a joint with the web
(22) of the joint sleeve (20);
b. the metatarsal portion (30), medially and laterally,
is configured in a tab-like fashion, in

which case these shaped tabs (31,131) engage
around the foot edges laterally and medially

and form the connection for the two non-extensibly
constructed cross strap bands (40,140) and

the transverse strap band (50) as well as being
inter connected via the transverse strap bands; 
c. wherein one (140) of the two cross strap bands
(40;140) is carried from the medial tab (131)

across the proximal back of the foot to the outer
ankle splint (21) and is secured to the same and

the other cross strap band (40) is carried from
the lateral tab (31) to the inner ankle splint

(121) and is secured to the same;
d. the ankle brace being particularly suitable for
the early functional treatment of fresh fibular

ligament ruptures and of severe tarsal distorsions .
Ankle brace according to Claim 1,

characterized in that

the highly flexible web (35) possesses a width of
approximately 5 cm.
Ankle brace according to either Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that

the axis of rotation of the joint formed by the highly
flexible web (35) proceeds from dorsomedial to anterolateral

and, with the foot longitudinal axis, forms
an angle of approximately 10Â° according to the anatomy

of the lower ankle of the foot.
Ankle brace according to any of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that

the joint sleeve (20) and the metatarsal portion
(30) are comprised of thermoplastic material.
Ankle brace according to any of Claims 1 to 4,

charecterized in that,

the parts comprised of thermoplastic material, on
the side of the skin, are provided with a coating

maintaining contact with the skin. 
Ankle brace according to any of Claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that

the strap band (23) interconnecting the two ankle splints
(21,121) within the rear region possesses a transverse

elasticity.
Ankle brace according to any of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that

the strap band (23) possesses a width of approximately
12 cm.
Ankle brace according to any of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that

the two ankle splints (21,121), on their front side,
are interconnected by means of two strap bands (25,

25'), which are constructed in the form of transversally
proceeding Velcro tapes (125,125') and which,

at one end, are hinged onto the outer ankle splint
(21) and are carried from there to the inner ankle

splint (121) and are here drawn through eyelets
(126,126') fixed to the inner ankle splint (121),

are then drawn sideways and subsequently closed
with the aid of Velcro fasteners.
Ankle brace according to any of Claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that

the cross strap bands (40,140) fastened to the tabs
(31,131) of the metatarsal portion (30) are constructed

in the form of Velcro tapes (40a,140a),
while to the madial and lateral tab (131,31) of the

metatarsal portion (30), one Velcro tape (40a; 140a)
each is rotatably hinged, while a Velcro tape (140a)

proceeds from the medial tab (131) to the outer
ankle splint (21), upon whose outside a rotatable

eyelet (42) is attached, through which the Velcro 
tape (140a) is drawn and Velcro-sealed, whereas the

other Velcro tape (40a) is carried from the lateral
tab (31) to the inner ankle splint (121), upon whose

outside a rotatable eye let (142) is mounted, through
which the Velcro tape (40a) is drawn and Velcro-sealed.
Ankle brace according to any of Claims 1 to 9,

characterized in that

the web (35) of the metatarsal portion (30) constituting
the joint possesses an increased rigidity on

the medial side.
