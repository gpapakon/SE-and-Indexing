<ABSTRACT>
A device for manipulating objects with at least one gripping unit or the like, which is connected via at least one arm to a drive mechanism and a drive motor, is provided with at least one hollow shaft (13) in the arm, the rotary motion of this shaft being transmissible to a subsequent shaft. The hollow shaft (13) engages by means of crenellations (34) into recesses (41) of a coupling unit (15), the coupling unit (15) having a helical toothing (17) at its other end.

Device for the manipulation of articles (11), 
having a gripper (8) which is connected via at least 

one arm (3, 5, 7) to a gear (2) and drive motor (2a, 
2b, 2c), at least one hollow shaft (13) with 

crenellations (34) engaging in receiving means (41) in 
a coupling piece (15), which is in alignment with the 

hollow shaft (13), and the coupling piece (15), 
provided with inserts (36), engaging in valleys (35) 

between the crenellations (34) for transmitting the 
rotary movement to a subsequent shaft in the arm (3, 

5, 7), an inclined toothing (17) being mounted on the 
other end of the coupling piece (15), characterised in 

that each crenellation (34) comprises a shank portion 
(37), the lateral faces of oppositely situated 

crenellations (34) pointing towards the valleys (35) 
and being respectively disposed in a common, 

axis-parallel plane, and in that each insert (36) 
comprises supporting faces (45) extending towards the 

receiving means (41), the supporting faces (45) of 
oppositely situated inserts (36) also lying in an 

axis-parallel plane (E).  
 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a peak (38) communicates with the shank portion 

(37) so as to form two inclined faces (47), and in 
that an inclined face (42) respectively communicates 

upwardly with the supporting face (45). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the inclined faces (42) of two adjacent inserts 

(36) lie in a plane which extends at an angle to the 

axis (B) of the coupling piece (15). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the inclined faces (42) of one insert (36) form a 

triangular cover face (43), the peaks (44) of 
oppositely situated inserts being disposed radially 

opposite one another. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the lateral faces are 

covered with balls (39). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that a rounded receiving base 

(46) communicates with the supporting faces (45).  
 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the crenellations (34) are 

formed from a connection piece (18) which sits in the 
hollow shaft (13) with a connection sleeve (30). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 
to 7, characterised in that the rotary movement of the 

hollow shaft (13) is transmittable via a conical wheel 
(16) to a conical wheel (19) of a subsequent hollow 

shaft (22), which conical wheel (19) tensions at least 
one ball bearing (14, 21) on the hollow shaft (13, 

22), a securing ring (50) being secured by means of 
screws (51) on one end face (52) of the hollow shaft 

(13, 22) and pressing with a shoulder (53) on one 
portion (54) of the conical wheel (16, 19), and one 

screw head (60) of the screw (51) being sunk in a head 
depression (63) of the securing ring (50) and abutting 

against a depression base (62) with a lower pressure 
face (61), depression base (62) and/or lower pressure 

face (61) having an inclined, preferably conically 
rounded configuration.
