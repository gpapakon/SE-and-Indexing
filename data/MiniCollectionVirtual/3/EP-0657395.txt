<ABSTRACT>
Process for the production of sized glass filaments consisting in coating the glass filaments with a size capable of polymerizing thermally, consisting of a solution whose solvent content is lower than 5 % by weight and viscosity lower than 400 cP, the said solution including a thermally polymerisable and/or crosslinkable base structure, the said structure including at least 60 % by weight of one or more components of molecular mass lower than 750, containing at least one acrylic and/or methacrylic and/or vinyl ether and/or N-vinylamide and/or N-vinyllactam functional group, the proportion of polyfunctional component(s) within the said components being at least 45 % by weight of the said components, so as to obtain glass filaments coated with an unpolymerised size capable of polymerising thermally. The invention also relates to the sized glass filaments obtained and the composites produced from the said filaments.

Process for the manufacture and treatment of sized
glass threads according to which a multiplicity of thin

streams of molten glass, flowing from a multiplicity of
orifices arranged at the base of one or more dies, are drawn

in the form of one or more sheets of continuous filaments,
then the filaments are gathered into one or more threads

which are collected on a moving support, characterised in
that a heat-polymerisable size is deposited on the surface

of the filaments in the course of the drawing operation and
before the filaments are gathered into threads, the size

being constituted by a solution of which the solvent content
is less than 5% by weight and the viscosity is less than or

equal to 400 cP, the solution comprising a base structure
which can be polymerised and/or cross-linked thermally, the

structure comprising at least 60% by weight of one or more
constituents that have a molecular mass lower than 750 and

that have at least one acrylic and/or methacrylic and/or
vinyl ether and/or N-vinylamide and/or N-vinyllactam

function, the proportion of polyfunctional constituent(s) in
the constituents being at least 45% by weight of the

constituents, in order to obtain glass threads coated with a
heat-polymerisable non-polymerised size.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
base structure represents more than 70% by weight of the

size deposited on the filaments and, advantageously, between
80 and 100% by weight of the size.
Process according to either claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that the base structure which can be

polymerised and/or cross-linked thermally comprises at least
one constituent having a molecular mass higher than 750. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the size deposited on the filaments

comprises at least one film-forming agent, the proportion of
film-forming agent(s) in the size not exceeding 10% by

weight.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the size deposited on the filaments

comprises at least one coupling agent, the proportion of
coupling agent(s) in the size not exceeding 15% by weight.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the size deposited on the filaments

comprises at least one lubricating textile agent, the
proportion of lubricating textile agent(s) in the size not

exceeding 8% by weight.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the threads are collected in the form

of rolls on a rotating support.
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that the
roll obtained comprises less than 5% by weight of size.
Process according to claim 8, characterised in that the
angle of cross-over of the threads of the roll is at least

1.5Â°.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the size deposited on the filaments

comprises from 0.5 to 4% by weight of organic peroxide(s). 
Process according to claim 10, characterised in that
the size deposited on the filaments comprises at least one

stabilising agent, the proportion of stabilising agent(s)
not exceeding 3% by weight.
Process according to either claim 10 or claim 11,
characterised in that the threads obtained are subje
cted to
the action of a thermal treatment after the collecting

operation in order to cause the size to polymerise.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the collected sized threads are

brought into contact with an organic material to be
reinforced, before subjecting the whole to a thermal

treatment aimed at polymerising or gelling the whole and at
obtaining a composite.
Glass threads as collected according to the process
defined in claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the

filaments of which they are composed are uniformly coated
with the non-polymerised size.
Glass threads obtained according to the process defined
in claim 12, characterised in that the filaments of which

they are composed are uniformly coated with the polymerised
size.
Glass threads according to claim 15, characterised in
that their loss on ignition is less than 5%.
Composite of organic material reinforced by glass
threads, characterised in that it contains glass threads as

defined in claims 15 and 16. 
Composite as obtained according to the process of claim
13, characterised in that it is formed from glass threads as

defined in claim 14.
