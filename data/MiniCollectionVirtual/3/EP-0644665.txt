<ABSTRACT>
The first circuit section 10A requiring protection of
its withstand voltage and the second circuit section requiring

no protection of its withstand voltage are provided in a
separated structure. The output terminal of the first circuit

section 10A and the input terminal of the second circuit
section 10B are provided as external terminals. Where

intrinsic safety is not required, the two external terminals
are directly connected outside the LSl. On the other hand,

intrinsic safety is required, in place of the first circuit
section 10A, an excess voltage suppressing circuit is connected

to the front stage of the second circuit section 10B.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a large scale
integrated circuit (LSI) which satisfies the condition of
intrinsic safety- explosion proof (hereinafter referred to
simply "intrinsic safety") in the field of industrial
instrumentation, control, etc. and performs communication
between terminals in such a manner that signals are superposed
while power is directly supplied to the terminals connected to
a transmission line. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an LSI for signal transmission for preferable use in
the communication standard "field bus" which is now being
standardized by the organization such as the IEC (International
Electrotechnical Commission).Fig. 5 is a view for explaining the gist of the system
proposed previously
JP-A-5-41709, hereinafter referred to as "proposed
system").In Fig. 5, symbol D denotes a dangerous zone where
explosive gas exists or there is danger of its presence; and
symbol S denotes a safe zone where there is not such danger.
In the intrinsic safety structure, in order to suppress the
voltage and current flowing into the dangerous zone, a Zener 
barrier (hereinafter referred to as "barrier") is arranged at
the boundary between the zones D and S.Terminals 7 connected in parallel to a transmission
line 5 composed of a pair of electrical wires are also
connected to the other terminal (master) 6 through the barrier
3. To both ends of the transmission line 5, terminators 4 each
composed of a resistor and a capacitor for D. C. cutting are
connected. To the terminals 7, D.C. power is supplied from a
bus power source 1 which is a constant power source through the
barrier 3 and the transmission line 5. Inductors 2 are
provided to separate this D.C. component and the A.C. component
of the signal generated when the terminals communicate with
each other. The terminal (master) 6 and the terminals 7
transmit a signal superposed on the D.C. current supplied from
the bus power source 1.Fig. 6 shows an example of the terminal used in the
proposed system (JP-A-5-41709).In Fig. 6, reference numerals 11 and 14 denote
operational amplifiers (OPEAMPs); 12 a voltage reference (IC
circuit for developing an accurate constant voltage; 13 a
resistor; and 15 and 16 denote tri-state gates. Symbol TXEN
denotes a control signal which is at a high level (H) during
transmission and a low level (L) during non-transmission, and
symbol TXD denotes a data signal. In Fig. 6, the voltage at point P1 is always stabilized
into e.g. 4.0 V by a 2 V voltage reference 12 and an
operational amplifier 11 using
