<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a dielectric optical fiber cable 
which is capable of being remotely detected while buried. Specifically, this 

invention incorporates magnetic materials into existing superabsorbent 
tapes which are commonly used to provide water-blocking capabilities in 

nearly all optical fiber cables. One embodiment of the present invention 
includes a tape which has been treated with a blend of neodymium iron 

boron and superabsorbent powders.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dielectric optical fiber cables which are
magnetically locatable.The two basic types of optical fiber cables presently used in the
industry are metallic cables and dielectric (or non-metallic) cables. At
present, it is believed that slightly less than one-third of telecommunication
systems use dielectric fiber optic cable. However, approximately half of
those using metallic cables have indicated through surveys that they would
use dielectric cables instead if there existed a reliable and cost-effective
method to locate the dielectric cable after it has been buried.Presently, there are basically two general types of technologies
involved in the detection of buried fiber optic cable, magnetic and metallic.
In general, the existing magnetic locators consist of either 1) magnetic
elements designed or embedded into the cable, or 2) a magnetic-field
emitting product which is buried alongside the length of the cable. The
residual magnetization generated by the past magnetic hysteresis of the
cable may then be detected by a magnetic locator. However, the
distribution pattern of the magnetic field often varies according to the cable
and its particular position along the cable and thus, it is difficult to detect
the correct cable when other magnetic members are located nearby.Alternatively, existing metallic fiber optic cable locators generally
use a detection method based on the electromagnetic field produced by the
application of an alternating current to the metallic sheathed cable.
However, the electric and/or magnetic field generated by the application of
an AC electric signal to the cable is often not strong enough to allow a
determination of the precise location of the cable. Such low levels of field
strength are particularly ineffective in locating cables buried deep under the
ground or sea bed.Commonly, to facilitate detecting a dielectric cable, a copper
ground wire is positioned just above the cable. However, the exposed
nature of this ground wire makes it very vulnerable to lightning strikes. 
Furthermore, when a cable's armor or detection wire is severed by lightning
or some other cause, it becomes impossible to apply an electric signal along
the cable, thus creating great difficulty in locating and retrieving the cable
for repair.Other existing detection methods include incorporating a non-conductive
tape which has been covered with a magnetic powder such as
strontium or barium ferrite or compounding and extruding these magnetic
powders in polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride
