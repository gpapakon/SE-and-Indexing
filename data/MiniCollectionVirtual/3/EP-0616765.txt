<ABSTRACT>
A hinge device is used in an aquarium tank (1) including 
a tank body (2) and a lid member (4) mounted on the tank body 

and having a front lid (3) pivotably attached thereto. The hinge 
device includes bottomed holes (14) formed in the opposite side 

surfaces (9a) of the lid member (4), a pair of pin members (15) 
each including an abutment portion (19), a shaft portion (17) 

and a resilient portion (18) between the abutment portion and 
the shaft portion, and bearing holes (16) formed the on opposite 

side walls (3a) of the front lid (3). The front lid (3) is 
pivotably attached to the lid member (4), with the abutment 

portion (19) abutted against the bottom of said bottomed 
hole (14) and the shaft portion (17) thrust into the bearing 

hole (16) by the resilient force of the resilient portion (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hinge device in an 
aquarium tank for raising tropical fish etc., particularly 
an aquarium tank comprising a tank body and a lid member mounted 
on the tank body and provided with an openable and closable 
front lid. An aquarium tank good in appearance and having a filter 
device, an illuminator, etc. which are easy to mount is disclosed 
in U. K. Patent No. 2,239,402, for example. The prior art 
aquarium tank comprises a tank body and a lid member mounted 
on the tank body. The tank body comprises a main frame made 
of synthetic resin or the like and open on the front, portions 
of the opposite sides and top, and a transparent frame made 
of glass, synthetic resin or the like, having a U-shaped 
sectional profile and mounted in the main frame so that the 
open front and side portions of the main frame are closed 
watertightly. The lid member is made of synthetic resin in 
the form of a shallow dish, has an openable and closable front 
lid for use in feeding tropical fish etc. and a rear casing 
in which an illuminator etc. are stored, and is provided on 
the back surface thereof with a receptacle for a heater etc. 
The front lid has a pair of bosses projecting toward each other 
and inserted into shaft holes formed in the framework of the 
lid member and is thus pivotally attached to the framework of 
the lid member. In this simply constructed hinge device, where 
the bosses have a short length, they are liable to disengage 
from the shaft holes, allowing the front lid to detach from  
 
the framework of the lid member. Where the bosses have a large 
length, it is necessary to widen the distance between the bosses 
by deforming the front lid when the bosses are inserted into the 
shaft holes. Such large length of the bosses does not pose 
a serious problem if the aquarium tank is of a small size. In 
the case of a large-sized aquarium tank, however, the front 
lid is difficult to deform and, if the front lid should be made 
of a deformable material, a strength problem arises. The front lid and the framework of the lid member can be 
pivotably attached by screwing from the outside. However, this 
method poses a problem of workability and detracts from the 
appearance of the aquarium tank. The front lid can also be pivotably attached to the 
framework of the lid member by inserting a coil spring and a 
pin shaft into a bearing hole and fitting the pin shaft loosely 
in a shaft hole utilizing the biasing force of the coil spring. 
In this case, since the coil spring and

<CLAIMS>
A hinge device in an aquarium tank (1) comprising a 
tank body (2) and a lid member (4) mounted on the tank body 

and having a front lid (3) pivotably attached thereto, said 
hinge device being characterised in that it comprises bottomed 

hole means (14) formed in opposite side surfaces (9a) of the 

lid member (4), a pair of pin members (15) each including an 
abutment portion (19), a shaft portion (17) and a resilient 

portion (18) between said abutment portion and said shaft 
portion, and bearing hole means (16) formed on opposite side 

walls (3a) of the front lid, that the front lid (3) is pivotably 
attached to the lid member (4) with said abutment portion (19) 

abutted against the bottom of said bottomed hole means (14) 
and said shaft portion (17) thrust into said bearing hole means 

(16) by a resilient force of said resilient portion (18).
