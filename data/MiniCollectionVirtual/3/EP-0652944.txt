<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel variant of
peroxidase, and a bleaching agent or detergent composition
comprising the peroxidase variant.The use of bleaching agents in washing procedures and
as constituents of detergent compositions is well known in the
art. Thus, bleaching agents are incorporated in or sold as
constituents of a major part of the commercially available
detergent compositions. Important conventional bleaching agents
incorporated in detergent compositions are compounds which act
as precursors of hydrogen peroxide formed in the course of the
washing procedure. Perborates and percarbonates are the most
important examples of compounds which are employed as bleaching
agents and which exert a bleaching effect in this fashion. The
detailed mechanism of bleaching by means of these bleaching
agents is not known at present, but it is generally assumed
that the hydrogen peroxide formed during washing converts coloured
substances (responsible for stains on fabric) into non-coloured
materials by oxidation and that some oxidation of the
coloured substances may also take place due to their direct
interaction with perborate or percarbonate.One drawback of these commonly used bleaching agents
is that they are not particularly efficient at the lower temperatures
at which coloured fabrics are usually washed. Their
efficiency may be enhanced by the use of activators (e.g.
organic acid anhydrides, esters or imides) which give rise to
the formation of peracids.Apart from being employed for bleaching stains on
fabric, such conventional bleaching agents have also been
suggested for preventing surplus dyes from coloured fabrics
which leach from the fabrics when these are washed from being
deposited on other fabrics present in the same wash (this 
phenomenon is commonly known as dye transfer). The problem of dye
transfer, of course, is most noticeable when white or light-coloured
fabrics are washed together with fabrics of a darker colour from which
dye is leached during washing.It has been found that peroxidases utilizing hydrogen peroxide as
their substrate are able to enhance the bleaching effect of hydrogen
peroxide during washing. The use of peroxidase for bleaching stains on
fabrics is described in WO 89/09813. It was also found that coloured
substances leached from dyed fabrics could be bleached by means of
peroxidases. The use of peroxidase for inhibiting the transfer of dye
from a dyed fabric to another fabric during washing is described in WO
91/05839.EP 0505311 discloses a DNA sequence (shown
