<ABSTRACT>
In a punching tool having a punch body (23), a punch driver (33) integral 
with the punch body, a punch head (45) disposed over the punch driver and struck 

by a striker (59), a punch guide (15) for guiding the punch body, a stripper plate 
(17) disposed under the punch guide, and a stripping spring (51) interposed 

between the punch guide (15) and the punch driver (33), the punching die further 
includes a first damping member (39) interposed between the punch guide (15) and 

the punch driver (33) so as to be elastically deformable within a predetermined 
deflection value. Owing to the presence of the first damping member (39), it is 

possible to reduce noise generated when the punch body (23) is returned upward 
by a strong urging force of the stripping spring (51) after work has been punched, 

thus preventing overall noise generated during punching processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a punching tool, and more specifically 
to a punching tool which can reduce punching noise generated during punching 
processing. Work mounted on a lower die can be punched by moving an upper tool 
up and down relative to the lower die. During this punching processing, punching 
noise is inevitably generated. To reduce the generated punching noise, 
conventionally a damping member made for example of urethane or the like has 
been disposed on a stripper plate provided at the lower portion of a punch guide for 
constituting a part of the upper tool. According to another proposal, the cutting 
edge of the punch body is formed with a shear angle to reduce the punching noise. In the conventional method of disposing a damping member made for 
example of urethane or the like on the stripper plate provided at the lower portion 
of the punch guide, there exists a problem in that the work surface is easily 
scratched because needle-shaped chips generated during punching processing 
adhere to the damping member. In addition, the life time of such a damping 
member is short and in addition it is rather difficult to mount or bond the damping 
member on the punch guide. On the other hand, in the conventional method of 
forming the cutting edge of the punch body with a shear angle, it has been difficult 
to reduce noise down to a sufficiently low level. The publication "Tooling and Production" Vol. 50, No. 7, October 
1984, Solon US pages 74-75, suggests the general use of a damping ring for 
reducing stamping noise and US-A-5 176 057 discloses a punching tool as recited 
in the preamble of claim 1, in which there is a collision between the flange region 
of the punch guide and the driver end. The primary object of the present invention is to provide a punching 
tool as recited in the preamble of claim 1 which can reduce the noise generated by 
collision of a punch guide with the lower portion of a punch driver, whenever a 
punch body is returned by an urging force of a stripping spring after the work has 
been punched. The above-mentioned object is achieved by the combination of the 
technical features of claim 1.  
 Further, it is preferable that the punching tool further comprises a 
second elastically deformable damping member (47) interposed between the punch 
driver (33) and the punch head (45). Further, it is preferable that a cutting edge of the punch body (23) is 
formed with a shear angle (25). Further, it is preferable that a driver end (31) fixed to a lower portion of 
the

A punching tool having a punch body (23), a punch driver (33) 
connected to the punch body (23), a punch head (45) disposed over the punch 

driver (33) and struck by a striker (59), a punch guide (15) for guiding the punch 
body (23), a stripper plate (17) disposed under the punch guide, and a stripping 

spring (51) interposed between the punch guide (15) and an upper portion of the 
punch driver (33), wherein the punch driver (33) is provided with a driver end (31) 

fixed to a lower portion of the punch driver (33), wherein the driver end (31) is 
disposed beneath a flanged region (15F) of the punch guide, which flanged region 

is positioned between the upper portion and the lower portion of the punch driver 
(33)
, characterised in that a first damping member (39) is interposed between the 
flanged region (15F) of the punch guide (15) and the driver end (31) of the punch 

driver (33) so as to be elastically deformable within a predetermined 
degree of deflection or deformation, and the stripping spring being disposed 

between the flanged region (15F) and the upper portion of the punch guide (33). 
A punching tool as claimed in claim 1, in which a lower portion of the 
flanged region (15F) has an annular recess (40) which accommodates the first 

damping member (39). 
A punching tool as claimed in claim 2 in which the first damping 
member (39) has a depth greater than the depth of the recess (40) by an amount (Î´) 

which represents the predetermined value or degree of deflection or deformation. 
A punching tool as claimed in claim 3, in which the first damping 
member (39) has a width less than the width of the recess (40). 
A punching tool as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising 
a second elastically deformable damping member (47) interposed between the 

upper portion of the punch driver (33) and the punch head (45). 
A punching tool as claimed in claim 5, in which the second elastically 
deformable damping member (47) allows movement of the punch driver (33) 

relative to the punch head (45) within a predetermined degree 
corresponding to deformation of the second damping member (47). 
A punching tool as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein a cutting 
edge of the punch body (23) is formed with a shear angle (25).
