<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing undesired sub-micrometer particulates 
from a chosen substrate (
16
) comprising the steps 
of: (a) placing the substrate containing the undesired particulates 

in a cleaning chamber (
12
) provided with megasonic 
energy-producing means (
20
); (b) introducing a liquefied 
gas (
22
), such as liquid carbon dioxide, into the 
cleaning chamber and contacting the substrate containing 

the undesired particulates with the liquid carbon dioxide 
at a temperature below its critical temperature; and (c) 

exposing the liquid carbon dioxide to the megasonic energy-producing 
means for a period of time sufficient to remove 

the undesired particulates from the substrate. The substrate 
containing the undesired particulates may optionally 

be contacted with carbon dioxide in the dense phase prior 
to and/or after the treatment with megasonic energy to aid 

in removal of the undesired particulates. Further, spent 
liquid carbon dioxide may be treated to regenerate fresh 

liquid carbon dioxide which is recycled to the cleaning 
chamber. Other gases besides carbon dioxide which may be 

used include nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, and xenon. 
Further, gas mixtures and gas mixtures with suitable modifiers 

may be employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of megasonic 
energy (>110 to 2,000 Kilohertz) to clean substrates, and, 
more particularly, to a process employing liquefied gas, 
such as liquid carbon dioxide, in combination with megasonic 
energy to enhance the cleaning of a wide variety of 
substrates, including complex materials and hardware. Ultrasonic cleaning has been utilized by industry for 
a number of years. In the conventional processes, the sonicating 
media are either organic solvents, or water and 
aqueous solutions, and ultrasonic energy (about 20 to 100 
Kilohertz) is applied to the media to promote cavitation, 
i.e., the formation of bubbles and their subsequent collapse. 
Although adequate for the sonication cleaning, both 
types of solvents have disadvantages. Many substrates require 
a rigorous drying process following exposure to an 
aqueous medium, and this is often a time-consuming thermal 
excursion. The use of organic solvents as sonicating media 
presents the problem of chemical disposal and is subject to 
strict regulatory controls. An additional disadvantage relates 
to handling of the removed contaminant(s), whether  
 
organic or particulate. When the contaminant is a hazardous 
material, such as a radioactive particle, once in solution 
or suspension, the volume of the hazardous waste is 
substantially increased, and this presents an additional 
pretreatment/disposal problem. In these conventional ultrasonic cleaning processes, 
sonic horns are often used to produce the sonic energy. In 
other processes, a cavitation nozzle may be used. Liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) is an inexpensive, nontoxic 
substance. The cleaning process utilizing liquid CO2 is 
relatively simple, and contaminants taken up in liquid CO2 
are easily removed therefrom, such as by decompression of 
the liquid or by filtration or by a combination of the two. 
Other suitable liquefiable gases may be used. Another type of cleaning process, utilizing phase 
shifting of dense phase gases, has been disclosed and 
claimed in U.S. Patent No. 5,013,366, issued to D.P. Jackson 
et al and assigned to the same assignee as the present 
application. The latter process employs a dense phase gas 
at or above the critical pressure. The phase of the dense 
phase gas is then shifted between the liquid state and the 
supercritical state by varying the temperature of the dense 
fluid in a series of steps between temperatures above and 
below the critical temperature of the dense fluid, while 
maintaining the pressure above the
