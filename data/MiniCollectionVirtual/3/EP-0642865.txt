<ABSTRACT>
In a device for the edge trimming of longitudinally advancing rolling mill products (3), having rotating trimming shears (7, 8) and rotating scrap or cutoff-edge parting shears, between which a cutoff-edge guide is arranged, in particular such a cutoff-edge guide in which trimming shears and scrap or cutoff-edge parting shears can be combined in the running direction of the rolling strip (3) to form a compact unit, an improved mode of operation and automatic cutting-free of the cutoff edges, which is necessary in particular in the event of malfunctions, without damage to the rolling strip are made possible when a transverse-dividing device (20) adapted to the cutoff-edge width is allocated to the trimming shears (7, 8).

<CLAIMS>
Device for trimming the longitudinal edges of a moving rolled strip, with rotating
trimming shears and rotating waste or edge strip cross-cutting shears, between which an

edge strip guide is arranged, especially such in which trimming shears and waste or edge
strip cross-cutting shears are combined into a compact subassembly in the running

direction of the rolled strip, characterised in that a transverse cutting equipment (20)
adapted to the width of the edge strip is arranged upstream of the trimming shears (7, 8).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the transverse cutting equipment
(20) is fastened to the trimming shears housing (18).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the transverse cutting
equipment is constructed as shears (20).
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the lower knife (22) of the shears
(20) is fixed and the upper knife (24) is movable forward and back.
Device according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a strip
clamping unit (5) is connected upstream of the trimming shears (7, 8).
Device according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that two
constructionally identical compact subassemblies (6) form an exchangeable trimming

shears pivotable relative to the region of running through of the rolled strip (3).
