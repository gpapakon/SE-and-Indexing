<ABSTRACT>
A sealed, lead-acid cell tray assembly for powering 
a vehicle characterized by the ability to provide vastly 

superior cycle life under regimes requiring relatively 
deep depths of discharge is disclosed. The cell tray 

assembly comprises a tray base (12), upstanding tray side 
walls (14) connected to the base, the base and the side walls 

being dimensionally configured to provide a cell 
enclosure area (16) having the ability to accept at least six 

sealed lead-acid cells in a horizontal position, cell-receiving 
members (18) positioned above the base and attached 

to the upstanding side walls (14) which divide at least part 
of the cell enclosure area into cell compartments capable 

of accepting at least one sealed lead-acid cell in a 
horizontal position and tray covers which limit access to 

the cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lead-acid cells and
batteries and, more particularly, to a cell tray assembly
for sealed, maintenance-free, lead-acid cells used in
motive power applications.The advantages that are provided by sealed lead-acid
cells and batteries in comparison to conventional,
flooded lead-acid batteries are substantial and varied.
Sealed lead-acid technology thus offers substantial
benefits by eliminating maintenance (e.g., cell
watering), expense (e.g., acid purchases), environmental
(e.g., expensive waste treatment systems and air-borne
acid mist) and safety (e.g., acid burns) concerns.It is thus not surprising that sealed lead-acid
cells and batteries are widely used in commerce today for
various applications that have widely differing
requirements. In stationary battery applications, the
sealed lead-acid batteries provide stand-by power in the
event of a power failure. For this type of application,
such stationary batteries are maintained at a full state-of-charge
and in a ready-to-use condition, typically by
floating at a constant preset voltage. Stationary
batteries are used for stand-by or operational power in a
wide variety of applications, including, by way of
illustration, telecommunications, utilities, for
emergency lighting in commercial buildings, as stand-by
power for cable television systems, and in
uninterruptible power supplies.Uninterruptible power supplies are systems that
back-up computers and communications networks. Sealed
lead-acid batteries may comprise the power source. The
uninterruptible power source allows for the orderly shutdown 
of computers when there is a sudden interruption in
the primary cycle source, such as during a power outage,
and provides back-up power for communications networks.
The uninterruptible power supply also will accommodate
short, or intermittent, losses in power. When there is a
power interruption, the batteries in the uninterruptible
power system can be subject to rapid discharge.Numerous stationary power applications require
anywhere from 6 to 120 cells or even more. Accordingly,
floor space, and sometimes even the height, required for
the batteries can present problems. To attempt to
minimize the floor space required, it is conventional to
position the batteries in various kinds of racks or
cabinets. Typically, the battery cabinets that are now
being used position the batteries only in a vertical
orientation. However, to lessen the floor space required
and to accommodate specific applications, sealed lead-acid
batteries have been
