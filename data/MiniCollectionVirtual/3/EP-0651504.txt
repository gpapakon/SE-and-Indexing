Mounting for quartz-oscillator discs, having a base
plate, having two current feed-through pins, which are

fastened in an insulated manner in the base plate and
respectively exhibit a flag having a receiving section

for holding the marginal region of the quartz-oscillator
disc, and having a central contact pin connected in an

electrically conductive manner to the base plate, which,
on its top side, exhibits a receiving groove in which the

rim of the quartz-oscillator disc engages, characterized
in that the receiving groove (25) is configured within

the base plate (20), and in that each receiving section
(7a, b) is configured such that it acts only at one

fastening point (31, 32) upon the quartz-oscillator disc
(2).
Mounting according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the fastening points (31, 32) are disposed such that they

form with the fastening point (30) located in the
receiving groove (25) an approximately equilateral

triangle.
Mounting according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the quartz-oscillator disc (2) is secured on the

mounting (1), at the three fastening points (30 - 32)
approximately evenly distributed over the periphery of

the quartz-oscillator disc (2), by means of an
electrically conductive adhesive (33).
Mounting according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the flags (6a, b) exhibit in their

receiving sections (7a, b), for the engagement of the
marginal region of the quartz-oscillator disc (2), a 

respective slot (8a, b) of sufficient length that the
lower section (9a, b) of the slot (8a, b) remains free

whenever the quartz-oscillator disc (2) is inserted.
Mounting according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the groove (25) is wider than the

thickness of the quartz-oscillator disc (2), and in that
the quartz-oscillator disc (2) is embedded in the

receiving groove (25) in an electrically conductive
adhesive (33).
Mounting according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the receiving groove (25) is

configured as a double groove (26a, b), the second groove
(26b) being configured narrower than the first groove

(26a) and within the first groove (26a).
Mounting according to Claim 6, characterized in that
the width of the second groove (26b) corresponds to the

thickness of the quartz-oscillator disc (2).
Mounting according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in
that the depth of the first groove (26a) is matched to

the thickness of the applied adhesive (33) such that this
does not project relative to the top side (24) of the

base plate (20).
Mounting according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the quartz-oscillator disc (2) is

secured at the respective upper slot section (13a, b) to
the flags (6a, b) by means of an adhesive (33).
Mounting according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the flags (6a, b) exhibit in the

lower flag section (10a, b) a form-out (40).
Mounting according to Claim 10, characterized in
that the lower form-out (40) extends away from the

quartz-oscillator disc (2).
Mounting according to one of Claims 10 or 11,
characterized in that the slot (8a, b) extends into the

form-out (40).
