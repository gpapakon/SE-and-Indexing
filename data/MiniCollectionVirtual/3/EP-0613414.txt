<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing pencils, the polymer binder is first melted in a lead extruder (19) for producing the leads. A powdery mixture of additives such as dyes, parting agents and adhesives is then added by a feeding extruder (2) to the polymer melt. After the components are intensively mixed in the lead extruder (1), a lead profile (13) is extruded and cooled in a first cooling section (3) until it is no longer plastic when it enters the casing injection head (3), but not yet completely cooled off. Appropriate materials for forming the pencil casing are supplied over casing extruders (4) and (5). In an ulterior second cooling section (8), the pencil profile is completely cooled and after running through a take-off station (11) it is cut in a sawing station (12).

<CLAIMS>
Method of manufacturing pencils with a firm lead and at 
least one casing, with which polymers are used as binding 

agents and the lead material and the casing material are 
extruded, characterized in that,
 
for manufacturing the lead, the polymeric binding agent 

is first of all melted,
 
in that then a powdered mixture of additives, which are 

known per se, such as colouring substances, lubricants and 
adhesives and possibly fillers, are added to the polymeric 

molten mass, the melting of the binding agent and the 
intermixing with the powdered additives being carried out 

in an extruder,
 
in that, after intensive intermixing of the polymeric 

molten mass with the additives, the lead material is 
extruded to form a lead profile,
 
in that the lead profile obtained is then cooled down only 

to the extent that the lead profile is just no longer 
plastic,
 
in that the casing material for forming the pencil profile 

is extruded on to the lead profile which has been cooled 
down but which is not yet cold, and
 
in that the pencil profile is then completely cooled down. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
temperature of the polymeric molten mass is continuously 

increased until the addition of the powdered mixture of 
additives, is reduced after the addition of the additives 

and is then increased again up to the extrusion 
temperature, the temperature only being reduced to the 

extent that the binding agent is still in molten form.  
 
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the mixture is subjected to at least one mixing 

and kneading cycle after the addition of the additives. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
mixture is subjected to at least two successive mixing and 

kneading cycles, each successive mixing and kneading cycle 
being carried out at a higher temperature than the 

preceding mixing and kneading cycle. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that a degasification is carried out during the 

addition of the additives. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that a degasification is carried out after the last 

mixing and kneading cycle. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that two casings are simultaneously extruded on to the 

lead profile, the outer casing of which takes the form of 
a thin layer of colour. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the pencil profile is calibrated immediately after 

the extrusion of the casing material. 
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in that the 
pencil profile is cooled down during calibration. 
Equipment for carrying out the method according to Claim 1 
having a lead extruder and at least one casing extruder 

connected to a casing extrusion head, characterized in 
that
 
the lead extruder (1) has a first charging station (18) 

and a second charging station (19), at least one melting 
and conveying section (20, 21) being located between the 

first and the second charging stations (18, 19) and at  
 

least one mixing and kneading section (24, 25, 26) being 
located after the second charging station (19),
 
in that a first cooling section (3) is provided between 

the lead extruder (1) and the casing extrusion head (16) 
and a second cooling section (8) is provided after the 

casing extrusion bead (6). 
Equipment according to Claim 10, characterized in that the 
second charging station (19) is connected to a charging 

extruder (2). 
Equipment according to Claim 10 or 11, characterized in 
that a first degasifying station (22) is integrated into 

the second charging station. 
Equipment according to one of Claims 10 to 12, 
characterized in that a second degasifying station (23) is 

located after the first degasifying station (22) and after 
the mixing and kneading section (24 to 26) of which there 

is at least one. 
Equipment according to one of Claims 10 to 13, 
characterized in that a calibrating station (7) is located 

after the casing extrusion head. 
Equipment according to Claim 14, characterized in that the 
calibrating station (7) forms at least a part of the 

second cooling section (8).
