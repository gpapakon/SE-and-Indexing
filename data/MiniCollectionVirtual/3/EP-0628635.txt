<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a process for the generation of male sterility in 
plants comprising the steps of (a) transforming a plant cell with antisense DNA 

sequences that selectively inhibit the expression of essential metabolic 
compounds and (b) regenerating plants from said plant cells. 
Cells impaired in the biosynthesis of basic metabolic compounds undergo 
starvation and eventually die. Such pathways include amino acid biosynthesis, 

nucleic acid biosynthesis and other biosynthetic pathways such as citric acid 
cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid metabolism, vitamin biosynthesis 

that will render the cell inactive due to nutrient depletion, if one or more enzyme 
involved in this pathway would become inactive by using antisense constructs.

<DESCRIPTION>
Male sterility is a property that is highly recognized in plant breeding. Male 
sterility enables the combination of traits from two parental lines, with the 
ultimate goal to supress negative traits from either parent with the genes from 
the other parent, and to superimpose positive traits carried by both parents. 
This results in a vigour that equals or exceeds either parental line. Several 
natural sources, e.g. cytoplasmic sterility or systems based on nuclear male 
sterility are already being used for many years. In crops were natural sources of 
male sterility are not available or not suitable, e.g. in tomato, hand emasculation 
and manual hybridization is still being carried out. Chemical companies recognize the importance of hybridization and developed 
chemical hybridizing agents that affect the pollenviability (and as a consequence 
the fertility) of the plants on which the treatment is applied (see Mabbet, 1992). In recent years, several molecular biological approaches have led to alternative 
ways for introduction of male sterility in crop plants. Mariani et al. (1990) 
introduced a RNAse that leads to tapetum ablation and results in transgenic 
plants that are male sterile. Recently, Worall et al. (1992) published a system where the premature 
dissolution of the microsporocyte callose wall causes male sterility in transgenic 
tobacco. Mol et al. (1991) found that an antisense chalcone synthase gene 
expressed in the flower, could result in the absence of pigmentation of the 
anthers and the loss of fertile pollen. Ylstra and van Tunen (1992) reported that 
depletion of flavonols in tapetal cells by antisense Chalcone synthase leads to a 
reduction in pollen viability.  Natural mutants deficient of chalcone synthase have been described already in 
mais (Coe et al. 1981) and produce white disfuntional pollen. Restoration to 
fertility could be partially obtained by pollination on wild type stigmas or by 
addition of micromolar quantities of kaemperol to the pollen germination medium 
(Mo et al. 1992). Utilization of these characteristics lead to a system for male 
sterility and conditional male fertility when kaempferol is supplied (Van Tunen et 
al. 1992). The exact role of flavonoides in the flower fysiology is still unknown. The International Patent Application WO 90/08830 is directed to methods for 
the production of male sterile plants by the expression of either a gene encoding 
a protein inhibitor, or a so-called killer gene. The expression of the genes in the 
male flowers leads to
