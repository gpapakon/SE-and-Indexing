<ABSTRACT>
An NMR probe is designed to generate both a homogeneous RF 
field over the sample volume and, alternatively, a "radial" field 

comprising two orthogonal gradient fields generated simultaneously in the 
transverse plane or a linear gradient field. The homogeneous field is 

generated by means of a known homogeneous coil construction, such as a 
Helmholtz coil or modified Helmholtz coil (700, 800). The radial field 

can be generated by means of an inverted Helmholtz coil (806), either 
modified or unmodified, and the linear field can be generated by a Golay 

type coil (706), which coils (706, 806) are positioned coaxially with the 
homogeneous coil (700, 800). The two coils (700, 706 and 800, 806) are 

connected in parallel to the RF signal generator (718, 814) and switching 
can be accomplished either by means of an active switch (716, 812) or by 

detuning one of the coil resonant circuits when the other coil is in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy and NMR imaging and, in particular, to NMR spectrometer
probes which include means for producing B1 magnetic field gradients.All atomic nuclei with an odd atomic mass or an odd atomic number
possess a nuclear magnetic moment. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
is a phenomenon exhibited by this select group of atomic nuclei (termed
"NMR active" nuclei), and is based upon the interaction of the nucleus
with an applied, external magnetic field. The magnetic properties of a
nucleus are conveniently discussed in terms of two quantities: the
gyromagnetic ratio (γ); and the nuclear spin (I). When an NMR active
nucleus is placed in a magnetic field, its nuclear magnetic energy levels
are split into (2I + 1) non-degenerate energy levels, which are separated
from each other by an energy difference that is directly proportional to the
strength of the applied magnetic field. This splitting is called the
"Zeeman" splitting and is equal to γhHo/2π, where h is Plank's constant
and Ho is the strength of the magnetic field. The frequency corresponding
to the energy of the Zeeman splitting (ωo=γHo) is called the "Larmor 
frequency" and is proportional to the field strength of the magnetic field.
Typical NMR active nuclei include 1H (protons), 13C, 19F, and 31P. For
these four nuclei I = 1 /2, and each nucleus has two nuclear magnetic
energy levels.When a bulk sample containing NMR active nuclei is placed within
a magnetic field, the nuclear spins distribute themselves amongst the
nuclear magnetic energy levels in accordance with Boltzmann's statistics.
This results in a population imbalance between the energy levels and a net
nuclear magnetization. It is this net nuclear magnetization that is studied
by NMR techniques.At equilibrium, the net nuclear magnetization is aligned parallel to
the external magnetic field and is static. A second magnetic field
perpendicular to the first and rotating at, or near, the Larmor frequency
can be applied to induce a coherent motion of the net nuclear
magnetization. Since, at conventional field strengths, the Larmor
frequency is in the megahertz frequency range, this second field is called a
"radio frequency" or RF field. The coherent motion of the nuclear
magnetization about the RF field is called a "nutation." In order to
conveniently deal with this nutation, a reference frame is used which
rotates about the z-axis at the Larmor frequency. In this "rotating frame"
the RF field, which is rotating in the stationary
