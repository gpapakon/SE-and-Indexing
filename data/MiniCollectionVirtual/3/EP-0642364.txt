<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for 
separating fluorochemicals from whole blood. More 
particularly, this invention relates to extracorporeal 
separation methods that remove a fluorochemical enriched 
fraction from fluorochemical-containing whole blood by 
means of a centrifugal apheresis device. The methods 
of this invention are useful in a variety of medical 
applications that use fluorochemical blood substitutes, 
particularly where extracorporeal removal of the fluorochemical 
from blood is desired as an alternative to 
natural excretion. Fluorochemicals, and especially perfluorochemicals, 
are known to be chemically and pharmaceutically inert 
and to be capable of dissolving and transporting large  
 
amounts of oxygen. Because of these properties, fluorochemical 
emulsions have been proposed as intravenously 
acceptable oxygen transport agents, and as "artificial 
blood" or "red blood cell substitutes" for human and 
animal patients. Fluorochemical emulsions thus have 
potential application in for example, emergency treatment, 
elective, emergency and trauma surgery, myocardial 
infarct treatment, coronary balloon angioplasty, stroke 
treatment, intraperitoneal oxygenation, and surgery 
involving hemodilution. Fluorochemical emulsions also 
have potential use as contrast agents for various 
imaging modalities such as nuclear magnetic resonance, 
ultrasound and x-ray. See European Patent Publication 
231 091 and PCT publication W089/10118. In addition, 
fluorochemical emulsions have been proposed as vehicles 
for supplying oxygen to the lungs in the field of liquid 
breathing. Fluorochemical emulsions thus have potential 
application in for example, the treatment of respiratory 
distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, ventilator distress, 
pneumonia, edema and other pulmonary complications. In 
liquid breathing applications, fluorochemical is also 
transported to the bloodstream. If not artificially removed from the patient's 
blood, fluorochemicals are cleared into the cells of the 
reticuloendothelial system (RES) over two to six day 
period, depending upon the dosage. See, e.g., K. 
Yokoyma et al., "Preparation of Perfluorodecalin  
 
Emulsion, An Approach to the Red cells Substitute," Fed. 
Proc., (34), pp. 1478-83 (1975). However, natural 
elimination, via the RES, may result in retention of 
some of the fluorochemical in the patient's organs. See 
J. Lutz, "Effect of Perfluorochemicals on Host Defense, 
Especially on the Reticuloendothelial System," 
Int'lAnesthesiologyClinics, (23), 63-93

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for extracorporeally removing 
fluorochemical from fluorochemical-containing whole blood 

of a patient comprising means (10, 16) for withdrawing the 
fluorochemical-containing whole blood from the patient, a 

centrifugal apheresis device (54, 80) for receiving the 
withdrawn blood for passage therethrough and for the 

removal of the fluorochemical, said device (54, 80) for 
centrifugally separating at a therapeutically acceptable 

spin rate said withdrawn blood into a fluorochemical-enriched 
fraction and a whole blood-enriched fraction, and, 

means (74, 78, 90, 92) for removing the whole blood-enriched 
fraction from the centrifuge device, characterized 

in that the withdrawal means (10, 16) withdraw a 
therapeutically acceptable extracorporeal volume of the 

fluorochemical-containing whole blood from the patient, in 
that the centrifugal apheresis device (54, 80) is a low 

volume device operating at therapeutically acceptable flow 
rates, and in that the apparatus includes means (24, 72, 

94) for removing the fluorochemical-enriched fraction in 
the centrifuge device to prevent build-up of fluorochemical 

in the device and means for either collecting the whole 
blood-enriched fraction or returning the whole blood-enriched 

fraction to the patient. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein both 
said means (24, 72, 74, 78, 90, 92, 94) for removing the 

fluorochemical-enriched fraction and whole blood-enriched  
 

fraction operate continuously during one uninterrupted 
cycle. 
Apparatus as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 
2, wherein the capacity of the centrifugal apheresis device 

(54, 80) is in the range of 70 to 200 ml. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
wherein the centrifugal apheresis device (54, 80) operates 

at a blood flow rate in the range of 40 to 120 ml/min. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
wherein the centrifugal apheresis device (54, 80) operates 

at a spin rate of 750 to 4000 Hertz. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
wherein the centrifugal apheresis device is a spinning 

cylinder device (54, 80). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the centrifugal apheresis device is a centrifuge 

belt device. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
wherein the centrifugal apheresis device is adapted to 

separate natural components of blood into component-enriched 
fractions by spinning the withdrawn whole blood at 

accelerated speeds.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
wherein the centrifugal apheresis device (54, 80) is 

adapted to reduce the fluorocrit of the whole blood-enriched 
fraction to a therapeutically acceptable level. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 9, wherein the 
fluorocrit is reduced to below about 5%. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
wherein means (26) is provided for treating the 

fluorochemical-containing whole blood with an anticoagulant 
prior to centrifuging.
