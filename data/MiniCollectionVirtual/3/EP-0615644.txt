<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a security system to protect
items of electrical and electronic equipment, particularly
computer equipment.Large organisations such as hospitals, colleges and
large companies make increasing use of high value computer and
other equipment. Unfortunately, this growth is accompanied by
a growth in theft and misuse of such equipment, especially as
the equipment is increasingly of a portable nature and in many
organisations security is difficult to maintain because of the
open nature of the premises. Although initially a record is
made of who the equipment is issued to and where it should be
located, this record quickly becomes out of date as the
equipment is borrowed and moved to other locations within the
organisation. A danger is that the equipment may become lost
within the organisation and unavailable when required for use.I have now devised a security system which enables the
location of electrical and electronic equipment to be monitored
on a real-time basis.In accordance with this invention, there is provided a
security system for electrical and electronic equipment,
comprising a group of first security units installed or for
installing in respective items of equipment to be protected,
each first security unit storing an identity code unique to the
associated item of equipment and being coupled to or for
coupling to a mains power input to the item of equipment, a
group of second security units installed or for installing at
respective mains power outlet sockets of premises in which the
equipment is to be used, each second security unit storing an
identity code unique to the associated mains power outlet
socket and coupled or for coupling to the mains, and a central
computer powered or for powering from the mains and including
a communications interface coupled or for coupling to the
mains, the central computer being arranged to poll the security
units of one said group by signalling over the mains, the
polled security unit signalling an acknowledgement back to the
central computer over the mains and causing the associated
security unit of the other group to signal its identity code
back to the central computer over the mains. For example in use of this system, the central computer
polls the items of equipment held in its database, the security
unit of the addressed item returning an acknowledgement: when
this acknowledgement passes through the associated mains
socket, the security unit of that socket detects that
acknowledgement and responds by transmitting its identity

<CLAIMS>
A security system for electrical and electronic
equipment, comprising a group of first security units installed

or for installing in respective items of equipment to be
protected, each first security unit storing an identity code

unique to the associated item of equipment and being coupled
to or for coupling to a mains power input to the item of

equipment, a group of second security units installed or for
installing at respective mains power outlet sockets of premises

in which the equipment is to be used, each second security unit
storing an identity code unique to the associated mains power

outlet socket and coupled or for coupling to the mains, and a
central computer powered or for powering from the mains and

including a communications interface coupled or for coupling
to the mains, the central computer being arranged to poll the

security units of one said group by signalling over the mains,
the polled security unit signalling an acknowledgement back to

the central computer over the mains and causing the associated
security unit of the other group to signal its identity code

back to the central computer over the mains.
A security system as claimed in claim 1, in which the
central computer is arranged to poll the items of equipment

held in its database, the security unit of the addresses item
of equipment being arranged to return an acknowledgement, and

the security unit of the associated mains socket being arranged
to detect that acknowledgement to signal its identity code.
A security system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, arranged
to employ mains signalling at a frequency or frequencies within

the range 500 Hz to 1 MHz.
