<ABSTRACT>
The workpiece (1) which has an axis of revolution (aa') is fastened into a rotary arbor (11) forming part of a tailstock (10) which can move in terms of translation on the bed of the grinding machine along a longitudinal axis (X) parallel to the axis of revolution (aa'). A support (16) integral with the bed and in the immediate vicinity of which a grinding wheel (18) is located, provides lateral support to part of the workpiece (1). The grinding of the workpiece (1) by the grinding wheel (18) over an arbitrary length which can exceed 1000 times its diameter, is obtained by moving the headstock (10) along the bed by this length in the direction of the longitudinal axis (X).

A grinding machine for machining parts, especially of
hard metal generated by rotation, exhibiting a high length-to-diameter

ratio comprising:

a framework and a headstock (10) arranged thereon
including a part-carrying arbor (11), said arbor driving a

part to be machined (1) in rotation around its axis of
revolution (aa'), a slider (17) supporting a grinder (18)

turning around an axis of rotation,
a support (16) secured on said framework and serving as
bearing for a portion of the part to be machined (1) lying

outside said arbor (11),

characterized in that it includes
means (13, 14, 15) for displacing said headstock (10)
on the framework along a longitudinal axis (X) parallel to

said axis of revolution (aa'), said grinder (18) being
arranged proximate said support (16) and in contact with

said part in a manner to bring the diameter through
abrasion thereof to the desired diameter over a length

equal to the displacement of the headstock, and
another grinder (21) working on the part (1) simultaneously
with the grinder (18) and arranged substantially

opposite the grinder (18).
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that
the grinder (18) is for rough grinding and the other

grinder (21) is for finish grinding, the part (1) being
machined in this order by the two grinders.
A machine according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in
that the axis of rotation of the grinder (18) is inclined

relative to the longitudinal axis (X).
A machine according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said slider (17) is movable in

translation on said framework along a transversal axis (Y),
and in that the displacements of the headstock and of the

slider are brought about by means of a digital control
arrangement (20) programmed so that the diameter of said

part to be machined (1) varies according to a predetermined
law.
A machine according to claim 4, characterized in that
said transversal axis (Y) is perpendicular to said

longitudinal axis (X).
A machine according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the other grinder (21) is arranged on

another slider (22).
A machine according to claim 6, characterized in that
said other slider (22) is movable in translation on said

framework along said transversal axis (Y), and in that the
displacement of the other slider is brought about by means

of said digital control arrangement (20).
