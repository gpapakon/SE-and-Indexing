<ABSTRACT>
A telephone system comprises: a telephone exchange with a central unit which is adapted for processing at least speech signals and call signals; a number of cordless handsets; at least one transmitter/receiver for communication between the exchange and the handsets; and a speech buffer present in each handset. The central unit is adapted for generating a call signal, the content of which depends on the nature of the connection to be made, which call signal is added to the speech signal; a handset is adapted for storing in the speech buffer and reading therefrom the content of that call signal; and acoustic and/or optical warning means are energized subject to that content.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a telephone system comprising:
a telephone exchange with a central unit which is
adapted for processing at least speech signals and call
signals;a number of cordless handsets;at least one transmitter/receiver for communication
between the exchange and the handsets; anda speech buffer present in each handset.Such a telephone system is known. Known telephone
systems of this type are based on internationally established
norms such as CT3 and DECT. The nature of such systems is
such that when an attempt is made to realize a connection
there is no absolute guarantee that the connection can be
made. The system architecture can further be such that more
portable handsets are incorporated in the system than there
are connecting channels in the system. This limitation of
possibilities affects the communication speed in respect of
signalling messages or calls between the fixed part and the
portable part of the cordless line. As the maximum capacity
of the system is approached, this communication speed will
decrease.Since the command signal for alerting the portable
handset with respect to an incoming call is transferred over
this fixed signalling path, it will be apparent that it is
not possible to use this path for transferring bell-on and
bell-off signals to a handset which could be used to follow a
specific ringing pattern generated by the telephone exchange
to which the handset is linked. Making use of this path would
result in a varying cadence depending on the specific
operational state of the system.The invention has for its object to resolve the said
problem. To this end the invention provides the insight that
the call command must be transmitted to the portable handset 
via the path with a fixed delay. In this respect the
telephone system according to the invention has the feature
that the central unit is adapted for generating a call
signal, the content of which depends on the nature of the
connection to be made, which call signal is added to the
speech signal;
a handset is adapted for storing in the speech buffer
and reading therefrom the content of that call signal; andacoustic and/or optical warning means are energized
subject to that content.The fixed part of the cordless line determines whether
the bell must be on or off by monitoring the analog line
connection from the telephone exchange. This information is
entered as command into the speech buffer of the portable
handset. This is possible since these buffers are not used
during the constructing of the connection.It will
