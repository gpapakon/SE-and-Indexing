<ABSTRACT>
In order to stabilize single- or double-curvature single-layer lattices of rods and nodal joints, prior art methods call for the lattices to be reinforced by a network of tensioned ropes. A prior art lattice of this kind contains pairs of ropes which have to cross the joints off-centre since they have to be passed under a central screw fastener of the joints of the corresponding lattice. Such pairs of ropes increase the cost of the reinforcing network, however. In addition, the reinforcing network suspended beneath the lattice results in relatively high-projecting joints. The invention resolves these problems by virtue of the fact that the joints (11) are made up of flat hollow cylinders which each have two pairs of bores (19, 20) located diametrically opposite each other so that the axes of the bores intersect the longitudinal axis (21) of each joint (11). Passing through each pair of bores (19, 20) are the ropes (12, 13) of the reinforcing network. Locking screws (22) in the joint (11) secure the ropes (12, 13) in the joint (11). The rods (10) of the lattice are bolted on to the joint (11) between the bores (19, 20) through which the ropes (12, 13) pass.
