<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of generating tomographic images of an investigated area, through which X-rays are put from multiple radiation source positions, to generate separate individual images. For each individual image, image values, which correspond to the absorption in its image points, are stored. Tomographic images are generated, and in them tomographic image values are derived from the image values of the image points of the individual images, which are assigned geometrically to a tomographic image point. Contrast reversal and pseudo-resolution effects may occur. These are removed by deriving the tomographic image values by means of a weighted summation, in which the weighting with which the image values of the individual images go into the summation becomes smaller as the distance of the radiation source position from a central radiation source position when the relevant individual image was generated becomes greater.

<CLAIMS>
A method of generating slice mages of an examination zone which is
irradiated by X-rays from a plurality of radiation source positions in order to generate

separate single images, for each single image there being stored image values which
correspond to the absorption in its image points, slice images being generated in that

slice image values are derived from the image values of the image points of the single
images which are geometrically associated with a slice image point, 
characterized in that

the slice image values are derived by a weighted summing operation where the weight
with which to the image values of the single images enter the summing operation is

smaller as the distance between the radiation source position and a central radiation
source position was greater upon generation of the relevant single image.
A device for carrying out the method claimed in Claim 1, comprising at
least one X-ray source for irradiating an examination zone from a plurality of radiation

source positions which are situated in one plane, an image converter for converting the
single images picked up in the radiation source positions into image values, and an

image storage device for storing the image values of the single images, an image
processing unit for generating slice images from the image values of the single images,


characterized in that
 the image processing unit comprises an arithmetic unit which, in
order to generate slice images, multiplies the image values by a weighting factor which

is dependent on the radiation source position upon generation of the associated single
image and which sums the image values, thus weighted, of the image points

geometrically associated with a slice image point.
A device as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the image
processing unit comprises a memory in which several, different sets of weighting factors

are stored, there being provided selection means for the preferably interactive selection
of a set of weighting factors.
