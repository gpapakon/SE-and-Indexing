<ABSTRACT>
A method of identifying peptides of an antigen of interest which are capable of recognition by or induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, comprises the steps of: ascertaining a "motif" of peptides which bind to a chosen HLA class I allele; providing peptides having this motif which are present in the known sequence of the antigen of interest; screening the peptides using an HLA assembly assay; and screening the resulting peptides for recognition by or induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The above peptides have been identified by this method, and the peptides and vaccines containing them are also claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Human leucocyte antigens (HLA) play a pivotal
role in cellular immune responses. They present
peptides derived from various proteins to T
lymphocytes: HLA class I molecules present peptides
derived from intracellular, cytoplasmic, antigens to
(CD8 positive) HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T cells
[1], whereas HLA class II molecules present peptides
derived from exogenous antigens to (CD4 positive)
regulatory T lymphocytes [2].The precise definition of such peptide
epitopes is of interest for understanding variation in
immune responses between individuals, for identifying
the pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune disorders and
for designing subunit vaccines. Recently, by eluting
peptides from purified class I molecules, Rammensee and
colleagues [3] and others [4] showed that particular
HLA class I types, bind short peptides of 8-10 amino
acids in length. Furthermore, they found conserved
amino acids at certain positions in the peptides bound
to particular class I molecules which are
characteristic of the individual HLA, and thereby
defined "motifs" for the type of peptide that binds to
a given HLA type. This suggests a means of identifying
epitopes within previously known protein antigens by
selecting short peptide sequences from that antigen
that fit the peptide "motif" for a given HLA. However,
it is likely that only a small proportion of peptides
fitting such a motif are actually epitopes [5].We have recently developed a novel assay [6], 
termed an HLA assembly assay, which provides a means of testing
whether particular peptides will bind at high affinity to a particular HLA
class I molecule, such as HLA-A2. Peptides which act as epitopes would
be expected to bind to their particular class I molecule with high affinity,
and we found that known HLA-A2 epitopes did so [6]. This suggested to
us that combining the techniques of Rammensee et al. to identify
conserved residue(s) in peptides binding a particular HLA class I with the
HLA assembly assay to screen such peptides for high-affinity binding,
would provide a rapid and novel approach to identifying peptides presented
by HLA class I molecules that should include most or all HLA class I
restricted T cell epitopes in that antigen. Then cytotoxic T cell assays may
be undertaken using lymphocytes from individuals exposed to the micro-organism
to identify which of the binding peptides are recognised as
cytoxic T cell epitopes.We have developed a method of identifying peptides of an
antigen of interest which are capable of recognition by or induction of
cytot
