<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to transfected primary and secondary somatic cells of vertebrate origin, particularly mammalian origin, transfected with exogenous genetic material (DNA) which encodes a desired (e.g., a therapeutic) product or is itself a desired (e.g., therapeutic) product, methods by which primary and secondary cells are transfected to include exogenous genetic material, including DNA targeting by homologous recombination, methods of producing clonal cell strains or heterogenous cell strains, methods of gene therapy in which the transfected primary or secondary cells are used, and methods of producing antibodies using the transfected primary or secondary cells. The present invention includes primary and secondary somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, glial cells, neural cells, formed elements of the blood, muscle cells, other somatic cells which can be cultured and somatic cell precursors, which have been transfected with exogenous DNA which is stably integrated into their genomes or is expressed in the cells episomally. The exogenous DNA either encodes a product, such as a translational product (e.g., a protein) or a transcriptional product (e.g., a ribozyme or an anti-sense nucleic acid sequence) which is a therapeutic product or is itself a therapeutic product (e.g., DNA which binds to a cellular regulatory protein or alters gene expression).

<DESCRIPTION>
Efforts to develop human gene therapies have their 
roots in the 1950s, when early successes with kidney 
transplantation led to speculation that it might be 
possible to transplant cells from a normal individual into 
a patient suffering from a genetic disease. Soon after 
the discovery of the enzymatic defects in Gaucher's and 
Niemann-Pick disease, scientists considered organ and bone 
marrow transplantation and enzyme supplementation to treat 
rare genetic disorders (Brady, R., NEJM275:312 (1966)). 
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, several investigators 
speculated that it also might be possible to introduce 
genes into a patient's own cells, and the cloning of the 
first human genes only a few years later intensified work 
in the field. Until recently, almost all of the theoretical and 
experimental work on human gene therapy was centered on 
extremely rare genetic diseases, and gene therapy has come 
to mean, to many in the field, the modification of a 
patient's genes to treat a genetic disease. However, gene 
therapy has far wider applications than simply treatment 
of a genetic disease. Gene therapy is perhaps more 
appropriately described as medical intervention in which 
cells, either from the individual to be treated or another 
appropriate source, are modified genetically to treat or 
cure any condition, regardless of etiology, that will be 
ameliorated by the long-term delivery of a therapeutic 
protein. Gene therapy can therefore be thought of as an 
invivo protein production and delivery system, and almost 
all diseases that are currently treated by the  
 
administration of proteins are candidates for treatment 
using gene therapy. Gene therapy can be divided into two areas: germ cell 
and somatic cell gene therapy. Germ cell gene therapy 
refers to the modification of sperm cells, egg cells, 
zygotes, or early stage embryos. On the basis of both 
ethical and practical criteria, germ cell gene therapy is 
inappropriate for human use. In contrast to germ cell 
gene therapy, somatic cell gene therapy would affect only 
the person under treatment (somatic cells are cells that 
are not capable of developing into whole individuals and 
include all of the body's cells with the exception of the 
germ cells). As such, somatic cell gene therapy is a 
reasonable approach to the treatment and cure of certain 
disorders in human beings. In a somatic cell gene therapy system, somatic cells 
(e.g., fibroblasts, hepatocytes, or endothelial cells) are 
removed from the patient, cultured invitro,
