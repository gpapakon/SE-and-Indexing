<ABSTRACT>
Birds, especially, pigeons dislike the presence of a 
magnetic field because each bird has a biological instinctive 

ability of sensing the presence of the magnetic field. In 
order to utilize this biological instinctive sensing ability 

for the purpose of preventing birds from crowding at the upper 
part of a building, a plurality of magnetic members are 

disposed on an arm(s) turnably held at the uppermost end of a 
support column. When a bird perches on the arm, the latter is 

turned by the action of his own dead weight, resulting in the 
bird amazingly flying away from the arm. It is effective that 

a rotary wind blade having two magnetic members immovably 
secured to the opposite sides thereof is disposed at the 

uppermost end of each support column so as to largely affect 
the magnetic field induced by the magnetic members disposed on 

the arm and the magnetic members disposed on the rotary wind 
blade. Magnetic members may be disposed on a wire-shaped 

member tightly spanned between adjacent support columns, a 
bird threatening unit, a plurality of wires suspending from 

the upper end of an opening portion located above the veranda 
of a building or a similar member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus
for inhibitively preventing birds such as pigeons or the like
from crowding at the upper part of a building such as a veranda
or the like. More particularly, the present invention relates
to improvement of an apparatus of the foregoing type.In recent years, the number of birds such as pigeons,
crows, sparrows, gray starlings or the like living in a city
increases but droppings and infectious bacilli discharged from
birds become a serious problem from the viewpoint of
environmental sanitary. In view of the foregoing fact,
various proposals have been made with respect to an apparatus
for inhibitively preventing birds such as pigeons or the like
from crowding inside of a veranda or a similar location on a
building by utilizing, e.g., needles, supersonic sound,
rapacious bird eye-like convexly marks or the like. In
addition, another proposals have been made with respect to an
apparatus of the foregoing type in significant consideration
of the fact that each bird dislikes the presence of a high
intensity of magnetic field because the biological instinctive
ability of each bird for sensing the magnetic field (effective
for determining the direction of his flying or maintaining an
instinct of returning to his home position by himself) is
adversely disturbed by the magnetic field. In this
connection, it is recommendable that reference is made to an
official gazette of, e.g., Japanese Utilization Model
Publication NO. 4-10789
(Application No. 63-42278)
which discloses a typical apparatus of
the aforementioned type.However, this conventional apparatus has the following
problem. Specifically, a plurality of semispherical magnets 
arranged along a tension wire in the substantially equally
spaced relationship as seen in the horizontal direction
exhibit a function of preventing pigeons from crowding on the
tension wire to some extent but some pigeons are not sensitive
to the magnetic field, causing them to perch still on the
tension wire between adjacent magnets. For this reason, the
foregoing proposed apparatus is not satisfactorily acceptable
for any user.In addition, a proposal has been made by an applicant
common to the present invention with respect to an apparatus
for inhibitively preventing birds from crowding at the upper
part of a building wherein the apparatus is constructed such
that a pair of support columns are caused to stand upright
from the handrail of a veranda, a wire is tightly spanned
between both the support columns, and a plurality of

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for preventing birds from
crowding at the uppermost part of a building, comprising;


a support column (1) standing upright from the upper part of
said building,
an arm (2) turnably disposed at the uppermost end of said
support column (1) to turn about an intersection (3)

in the upward/downward direction
and/or in the leftward/rightward direction, said support

column (1) normally intersecting said arm (2) at a right angle,
said intersection (3)

being positionally coincident with the uppermost end of said
support column (1), and
two magnetic members (4a, 4b) disposed at the opposite ends of
said arm (2).
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein two or more
arms (2A, 2B) are arranged one above another to build a two-staged

structure, a three-staged structure or the like.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
two or more arms (2D, 2E) are arranged in the equally spaced

relationship as seen in the circumferential direction while
defining a certain angle between adjacent arms, and two

magnetic members (4a, 4b) are disposed at the opposite ends of each of
said arms.
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claim 1 to claim 3,
wherein each of said support column and/or said arm(s) is

prepared in the form of a coil spring (1c, 2c).
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claim 1 to claim 4,
wherein each arm is made of a metallic material.
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claim 1 to claim 4,
wherein each arm is made of a non-metallic material such as
