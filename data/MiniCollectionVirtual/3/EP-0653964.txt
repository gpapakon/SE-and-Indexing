<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for the continuous inspection of containers while they are being conveyed, in particular for the analysis of the air in the container by analytical instruments. The aim of the invention is to simplify inspection by making the tme-consuming insertion and removal of sampling tubes unnecessary and enabling samples to be taken at high speeds from the interior of such containers. This aim is achieved by virtue of the fact that the air to be examined is driven out of the container and collected near the mouth of the container, and then fed to an analytical device.

Method for taking air samples from containers (2) and feeding them to an analytical 
device; comprising an injection nozzle (4) positioned in the area of a container 

opening and transferring pressure impulses of a pressure medium into the containers 
(2), by this absorbing the expelled air, by means of which the containers are 

conducted on a conveyor past a stationary analytical device, with which part of 
the air contained in each of the containers (2) passing the device can be extracted 

without contact and fed to the analytical device, and one or several pressure impulses 
of a pressure medium are transmitted to each container (2) for expelling 

the container air; and the air expelled by this is fed to the analytical device, 
characterised 
in that
 the expelled air is kept in readiness in a collection chamber 
(body 6) above the container opening and sucked out of this chamber for analysis. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the stationary analytical device 
becomes effective by absorption. 
Device for taking air samples from containers (2) and feeding them to an analytical 
device with a suction pipe (7) leading to the analytical device and ending in a 

suction device placed in the area of the containers and with a conveyor conducting 
the containers past the suction device, 
characterised in that
 an injection 
nozzle (4) reacting to pressure impulses of a pressure medium is positioned in the 

area of the passing container opening and placed in such a position to the suction 
device that the air expelled by the applied pressure impulses is absorbed and fed 

to the analytical device, and the suction device consists of an air cell container 
(body 6) which has a connection with the suction pipe (7) leading to the analytical 

device. 
Device according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the suction device is formed 
by a tubular body (6) providing escape openings (10) on its wall.  

 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 3 or 4, 
characterised in that
 
one or several injection nozzles (4) are positioned asymmetrically about the container 

axis and the transport direction of the containers (2) and the suction device 
is arranged above the escape cross-section of the container opening.
