<ABSTRACT>
The concentration of carbon monoxide in a gaseous medium is reduced by selective catalytic oxidation in the presence of gaseous oxygen by passing the gaseous medium through a quantity of a catalyst capable of oxidizing carbon monoxide in an exothermic reaction at temperatures within a given temperature range. The temperatures encountered in the catalyst are controlled in such a manner that the exothermic reaction takes place first above a threshold temperature below which the catalyst would be rapidly inactivated at the relatively high carbon monoxide concentrations present in the gaseous medium as it enters an inlet portion of the catalyst quantity, and subsequently in an outlet portion of the catalyst quantity at less than the threshold temperature to further reduce the carbon monoxide concentration to a desired minimum level below that achievable at temperatures above the threshold temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment
of gases in general, and more particularly to a
method of and an apparatus for removing carbon
monoxide from gaseous media.There are already known various methods of and
apparatus constructions for removing carbon monoxide
from gaseous media, among them such capable of
removing carbon monoxide by oxidation in the
presence of gaseous oxygen from gaseous media that
additionally contain other oxidizable or otherwise
reactable substances, such as hydrogen, using
catalysts that selectively or preferentially promote
the desired conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon
dioxide.One such approach is disclosed in an article
authored by M. L. Brown et al titled "Purifying
Hydrogen by . . . Selective Oxidation of Carbon
Monoxide", appearing in Volume 50, No. 10 of
Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, pp. 841-844
(1960). As discussed there in the context of
ammonia synthesis, certain catalysts, such as
alumina-supported platinum, are capable of
selectively promoting the oxidizing reaction of
carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide with only small or
negligible losses of hydrogen contained in the
gaseous medium being treated to water formation, so
long as the temperature at which the reaction takes 
place is above a threshold temperature. However,
it is also disclosed in this article that there is a
relatively high limiting value below which the
carbon monoxide concentration cannot be reduced when
the oxidation reaction is conducted at such
relatively high temperatures in a single stage.
This limitation is primarily if not exclusively
attributable to a reverse shift reaction in which
carbon dioxide reacts with hydrogen to form carbon
monoxide and water. On the other hand, this article
also mentions that, when it was attempted to conduct
the selective oxidation reaction on the incoming
gaseous medium, which has a relatively high carbon
monoxide concentration, at temperatures below the
threshold temperature, the catalyst very rapidly
became ineffective and did not become effective
again merely as a result of a subsequent raising of
the reaction temperature to above the threshold
temperature; rather, it was necessary first to purge
the catalyst using a gaseous medium substantially
devoid of carbon monoxide at temperatures above the
threshold temperature, followed by conducting the
selective oxidation reaction at such elevated
temperatures. Thus, this article indicates that it
is impossible or at least not feasible to treat the
incoming gaseous medium at temperatures below the
