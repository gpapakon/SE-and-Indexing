<ABSTRACT>
A drill/driver (eg. an electric drill) with a screwdriver attachment, and a method 
of controlling the drill/driver, are described. A control circuit (30) controls the 

speed of rotation of the motor (38, 39) through a time delay circuit (42) and a 
triac (41). The control circuit (30) uses the time delay information and 

information inputted from a rotational speed sensor (43) to monitor the current 
in the motor or a parameter related at least in part to current in the motor. 

When a change corresponding to an increase in the rate of change of current in 
the motor is detected, the control circuit (30) stops the motor to provide an 

automatic torque control feature for a screwdriving operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
power screwdrivers and power drills with a
screwdriving facility, and which are referred to as
"drill/drivers" herein, respectively to a method of controlling
such a drill/driver.The efficient and economic use of power tools depends
upon the correct selection of the conditions under which the
tool is to be operated. For example, in a power drill, the
speed of rotation of the drill bit depends upon the drill
size and the material of the workpiece upon which the drill
is to be used. In the case of screwdriving, the rotational
speed of the screwdriver is determined in accordance with
the screw size. It is also important to be able to stop the
tool when the screw has been screwed home fully to avoid
overloading the tool driving motor or damage the workpiece.It has been proposed to employ electronic means to
determine, in accordance with information fed to the means
by a user, the rotational speed of the motor driving the
tool holder of the power tool, such means also maintaining
the set speed at a constant value and monitoring the
conditions under which the power tool is operating. In
particular, the means may monitor the torque exerted by the
tool and operate to de-energise the power tool motor in the
event that the torque exceeds a safe value, but the prior
proposals have not been totally effective.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
provide a power tool with a more effective torque sensing
and control arrangement. The present invention is based upon the
results of observations of the current which passes through
the motor of the power tool during operation, and
specifically of the current passing through the motor of a
drill/driver as herein defined as it operates to screw a
screw into a workpiece. In this respect reference is made
to Figure 4 of the accompanying drawings, which is a graph
showing changes in motor current (vertical axis) against
time (longitudinal axis) that take place during a screw
driving operation. The contour of the graph is
substantially the same for all permitted screw sizes but the
actual current values will depend on the screw size. During
period T1, there is a gradual increase in motor current as
the screw penetrates the surface of and starts to enter a
workpiece, there being a gradual increase in the resistance
to rotation offered to the screw. There then follows a time
period T2 during which the current flow is substantially
constant as the screw thread enters and is driven further
into the workpiece. At the end of time period
