<ABSTRACT>
A coordinate input apparatus has an effective area in a 
vibration transmission member for inputting a vibration from 

a vibration generator and a computing unit that computes the 
coordinates of the position of the vibration generator on 

the basis of the delay time between the vibration generation 
and the detection of the vibrations by a vibration sensor. 

A vibration proof material is disposed in the periphery of 

the vibration transmission member to prevent the inputted 
vibrations from being reflected at the acoustic impedance 

boundary of the vibration transmission member. The 
vibration proof material is disposed so that the spacing 

between the edge of the effective area and the edge of the 
vibration proof material facing the effective area edge 

becomes larger with increasing distance along the effective 
area edge from the vibration sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coordinate input
apparatus for detecting the coordinates of an input point on
the basis of the transmission time of a vibration on a
vibration transmitting plate or the like.Hitherto, a coordinate input apparatus has been known
in which vibrations are input by a vibration pen having a
piezoelectric element installed therein to a vibration
transmitting plate, and the coordinates of the input point
are detected by a plurality of sensors disposed on the
vibration transmitting plate.In such a coordinate input apparatus, as shown in Fig.
7, a vibration proof material is mounted in the periphery of
a vibration transmitting plate 8 to prevent detection
accuracy from decreasing due to interference of unwanted
vibrations (reflected wave) from an end surface of the
vibration transmitting plate 8.However, a reflected wave occurs in a secondary manner 
even in an acoustic impedance discontinuous boundary formed
in the mounting interfacial boundary of the vibration proof
material, ie vibration absorbing material, itself that is mounted to prevent unwanted
vibrations (reflected wave) from the end surface of the
vibration transmitting plate 8. It is assumed that a
rectangular region where coordinates can be input
effectively within the vibration transmitting plate is an
effective area. Particularly, as shown in Fig. 8, when a
vibration sensor is mounted spaced a fixed distance from the
vibration proof material, the effect of the reflected wave
of the vibration input by a vibration pen from an area R
near the side in proximity to the vibration sensor from
among the four sides of the effective area and in the
farthest corner from the vibration sensor is large. This
large effect is caused by the boundary of the vibration
proof material and occurs because the angle of reflection α
shown in the figure is largest. As is well known the
reflectance increases as the angle of reflection increases.To maintain the angle of reflection α at a
predetermined angle or less, it is necessary to increase the
distance between the effective area and the boundary of the
vibration proof material and to enlarge the vibration
transmitting plate. That is, in the construction in which a
conventional vibration sensor is mounted spaced a
predetermined distance from the vibration proof material, 
the effective area, the vibration proof material, the
vibration sensor, and the vibration transmitting plate are
disposed and their dimensions are determined so that the
angle of reflection becomes a predetermined angle or
