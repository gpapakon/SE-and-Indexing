<ABSTRACT>
It is necessary for the electrical cables assembled to form cable looms in aircraft to be held at an exactly defined separation, without being damaged. A spacer (1) for cables, especially electrical cable looms (2, 2') in aircraft is characterised in that the spacer (1) essentially consists of at least a first spacer element (4) and a second spacer element (5) which in each case have a cable holder (6, 6') and a locking part (9, 10) fastened on the latter, and can be joined by snap-in fastening, in that the cable holder (6, 6') essentially consists of at least one retention bridge (7, 7'), on the ends of which positioning bodies (8, 8'), matched to correspond to the outer shape of the cable loom (2, 2'), are provided and in that the snap-in fastening is designed so as to allow the first and second spacer elements (4, 5) to be twisted in opposite senses about the common longitudinal axis (20). The advantage is that the cables which lie parallel and/or crossing over in a plane can be held at an exactly defined separation, without the electrical cables assembled to form cable looms being damaged and crushed.

<CLAIMS>
Spacer (1) for cables, particularly for bundles of 
electrical cables (2, 2') in aircraft, to which the bundles of 

cables (2, 2') are connected at least with a cable binder (3, 
3') passed through the spacer (1), wherein the spacer (1) 

consists essentially of at least a first spacer element (4) 
and a second spacer element (5) which in engaged form create a 

defined spacing, the first and second spacer elements (4, 5) 
each comprising a cable receptacle (6, 6') with a locking part 

(9, 10) fixed thereon, and wherein the locking parts (9, 10) 
can be connected to one another by way of a positive locking 

connection, the cable receptacle (6, 6') consists of at least 
one retaining bridge (7, 7') which in the inserted state butts 

against the outer contour of the bundle of cables (2, 2') and 
around which, together with the bundle of cables (2, 2'), is 

placed a cable binder (3, 3'), the longitudinal axis of which 
is almost parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bundle of 

cables, abutment pieces (8a to 8d, 8a' to 8d') which are 
adapted to the outer contour of the bundle of cables (2, 2') 

being provided on the ends of the retaining bridge, 
characterised in that the locking part (9) of the first spacer 

element (4) is constructed as a lug receptacle (13) for 
receiving an engaging lug (12) and the locking part (10) of 

the second spacer element (5) is provided with a cylindrical 
engaging lug (12) which consists of at least two lug parts 

(12a, 12b) with integrally moulded engaging catches, and the 
lug receptacle (13) is provided with a shoulder (13a) on which 

the catches of the lug parts (12a, 12b) rest in the engaged 
state and thus form a connection in the longitudinal direction 

which does not allow any movement in the direction of the 
longitudinal axis (20) but enables the first and second spacer 

elements (4, 5) to be turned in opposite directions to one 
another about the common longitudinal axis (20) without 

restriction.  
 
Spacer according to Claim 1, characterised in that at 
least one extension piece (11) can be inserted between the 

first and second spacer elements (4, 5). 
Spacer according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the spacer elements (4, 5) have angle markings (19). 
Spacer (1) for cables, particularly for bundles of 
electrical cables (2, 2') in aircraft, to which the bundles of 

cables (2, 2') are connected at least with a cable binder (3, 
3') passed through the spacer (1), wherein the spacer (1) 

consists essentially of at least a first spacer element (14) 
and a second spacer element (14') which in engaged form create 

a defined spacing, the first and second spacer elements (14, 
14') each comprising a cable receptacle (6, 6') with a locking 

part (21, 21') fixed thereon, and wherein the locking parts 
(21, 21') can be connected to one another by way of a positive 

locking connection, the cable receptacle (6, 6') consists of 
at least one retaining bridge (7, 7') which in the inserted 

state butts against the outer contour of the bundle of cables 
(2, 2') and around which, together with the bundle of cables 

(2, 2'), is placed a cable binder (3, 3'), the longitudinal 
axis of which is almost parallel to the longitudinal axis of 

the bundle of cables, abutment pieces (8, 8') which are 
adapted to the outer contour of the bundle of cables (2, 2') 

being provided on the ends of the retaining bridge, 
characterised in that the spacer elements (14, 14') each have 

an identical locking part (21, 21'), wherein the locking part 
(21, 21') is provided with an engaging pin (15), on the end of 

which is disposed a pin head (15a), and with a slot (16) which 
comprises a pin receptacle (17) adapted in diameter to the pin 

head (15a) and at least two engagement positions (18a, 18b) 
which within a range up to 90° enable the first and second 

spacer elements (14, 14') to be turned in opposite directions 
to one another about the common longitudinal axis (20), the 

longitudinal axis of the engaging pin (15) and the  
 

longitudinal axis of the pin receptacle (17) of the slot (16) 
lying diametrically opposite one another. 
Spacer according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
engagement positions (18a, 18b) and the pin receptacle (17) 

lie on a circular line, wherein the centre point of the circle 
simultaneously forms the axis (20) of the spacer element (14, 

14') and the engagement positions (18a, 18b) are disposed 
symmetrically with respect to the pin receptacle (17). 
Spacer according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
engagement positions (18a, 18b) are disposed in a range of 

approximately 45° starting from the pin receptacle (17), the 
pin receptacle (17) being rotated by approximately 22.5° with 

respect to an axis (22) lying parallel to the bundle of cables 
to be received. 
Spacer according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that a fixing element (24) can be inserted between the 

first spacer element (4) and the second spacer element (5). 
Spacer according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the second spacer element (5) can be 

fixed by means of the engaging lug (12) on a component (25), 
for example sheet metal.
