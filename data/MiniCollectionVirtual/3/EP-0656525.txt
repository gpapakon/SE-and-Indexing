<ABSTRACT>
A vibrating gyroscope 10 includes a vibrator 12 which 
has a regular triangular prism-shaped vibrating body 14 and 

piezoelectric elements 16a, 16b and 16c formed on side faces 
of the vibrating body 14. The piezoelectric elements 16a, 

16b and 16c having approximately same temperature 
characteristics are used. An oscillation circuit 26 is 

connected between the piezoelectric elements 16a, 16b and 
the piezoelectric element 16c. The piezoelectric elements 

16a and 16b are connected to a differential amplifying 
circuit 28, and the differential amplifying circuit 28 is 

connected to a detecting circuit 30. An output signal of the 
piezoelectric element 16c for feedback is half-wave 

rectified by a half-wave rectification circuit 32, and 
smoothed by a smoothing circuit 34. An output signal of the 

smoothing circuit 34 is supplied to an automatic gain 
control circuit 36, and a gain of the detecting circuit 30 

is controlled according to the input signal of the automatic 
gain control circuit 36.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibrating gyroscope, 
and particularly to a vibrating gyroscope for detecting a 
rotational angular velocity by utilizing a bending vibration 
of a prism-shaped vibrating body. 
Description of the Prior Art Fig. 4 is an illustrative view showing an example of a 
conventional vibrating gyroscope such as disclosed in US-A-5 111 083. A vibrating gyroscope 1 
includes a vibrator 2. The vibrator 2 includes a vibrating 
body 3 having, for example, a regular triangular prism 
shape. Piezoelectric elements 4a, 4b and 4c are formed 
respectively on side faces of the vibrating body 3. An 
oscillation circuit 5 is connected between the piezoelectric 
elements 4a, 4b and the piezoelectric element 4c. The 
piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b are used for driving to 
generate a bending vibration to the vibrating body 3, and 
for detecting to obtain a signal corresponding to a 
rotational angular velocity. The piezoelectric element 4c is 
used for feedback to the oscillation circuit 5, when the  
 
vibrating body 3 is driven. The piezoelectric elements 4a 
and 4b are connected to a differential amplifying circuit 6. 
An output signal of the differential amplifying circuit 6 is 
detected by a detecting circuit 7. In the vibrating gyroscope 1, the vibrating body 3 
bends and vibrates in a direction perpendicular to the face 
of the piezoelectric element 4c by a signal of the 
oscillation circuit 5. At this time, input signals to the 
differential amplifying circuit 6 are the same signal, and 
an output signal is not obtained from the differential 
amplifying circuit 6. When the vibrating body 3 rotates on 
its axis, a vibrating direction of the vibrating body 3 
changes by a Coriolis force. Thus, a difference is produced 
between the output signals of the piezoelectric elements 4a 
and 4b, and the difference of the output signals is obtained 
from the differential amplifying circuit 6. The output 
signal of the differential amplifying circuit 6 is detected 
by a detecting circuit 7. Since an output signal of the 
detecting circuit 7 corresponds to a rotational angular 
velocity, a rotational angular velocity supplied to the 
vibrating gyroscope 1 can be detected by measuring the 
output signal of the detecting circuit 7. However, in the conventional vibrating gyroscope, there 
is a case that the output signals of the piezoelectric 
elements change due to a variation of circumferential  
 
temperature. When the output signals change, a rotational 
angular velocity can not be detected
