<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to therapeutic reagents and peptides,
radiodiagnostic reagents and peptides, and methods for producing labeled
radiodiagnostic and radiotherapeutic agents. Specifically, the invention relates
to peptide derivatives and analogues of somatostatin, and embodiments of such
peptides labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m), as well as methods and kits
for making, radiolabeling and using such peptides to image sites in a
mammalian body. The invention also relates to peptide derivatives and
analogues of somatostatin labeled with rhenium-186 (186Re) and rhenium-188
(188Re), and methods and kits for making, radiolabeling and using such peptides
therapeutically in a mammalian body.Somatostatin is a tetradecapeptide that is endogenously produced by the
hypothalamus and pancreas in humans and other mammals. The peptide has
the formula:

[Single letter abbreviations for amino acids can be found in G. Zubay,
Biochemistry (2d ed.), 1988, (MacMillan Publishing: New York), p.33]. This
peptide exerts a wide variety of biological effects in vivo. It is known to act
physiologically on the central nervous system, the hypothalamus, the pancreas,
and the gastrointestinal tract.Somatostatin inhibits the release of insulin and glucagon from the
pancreas, inhibits growth hormone release from the hypothalamus, and reduces
gastric secretions. Thus, somatostatin has clinical and therapeutic applications
for the alleviation of a number of ailments and diseases, both in humans and 
other animals. Native somatostatin is of limited utility, however, due to its short half-life
in vivo, where it is rapidly degraded by peptidases. For this reason, somatostatin
analogues having improved in vivo stability have been developed in the prior art.Freidinger, U.S. Patent No. 4,235,886 disclose cyclic hexapeptide somatostatin
