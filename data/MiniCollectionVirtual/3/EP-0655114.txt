<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydraulic control 
system of an automatic transmission for automotive 
vehicle, particularly to a hydraulic control system of 
automatic transmission wherein line pressure is 
controlled variably to improve the power train 
efficiency and the response of shifting time during gear 
shifting. A conventional vehicle automatic transmission has 
a torque converter and a multiple stage transmission 
gear mechanism connected with the torque converter, 
which includes hydraulically actuated friction members 
for selecting one of the gear stages of the transmission 
gear mechanism in accordance with vehicle operating 
conditions. The hydraulic control system pressurized by a 
hydraulic pump provides the hydraulic pressure required 
to operate the friction members and control valves. A commonly used automatic transmission of a vehicle 
has a hydraulic torque converter which generally 
includes a pump impeller connected with an engine output 
shaft to be driven thereby, a turbine runner with an 
output shaft member, and a stator disposed between the 
pump impeller and the turbine runner, so that the fluid 
is circulated by the engine driven pump impeller through  
 
the turbine runner with the aid of the stator which 
functions to deflect the fluid from the turbine runner 
to a direction where the fluid flow does not disturb the 
rotation of the pump impeller when the fluid flows into 
the pump impeller. The automatic shift is made by operating the 
friction members such as clutches or a kick down brake 
at each shift change. Also, a manual valve of which 
ports are converted by selecting a position of a 
selector lever, is designed to be supplied with fluid 
from a hydraulic pump and to supply the fluid to a shift 
control valve. In case of a 4-speed automatic 
transmission, the shift control valve has an operated 
port made by an electronic control system. An example of a hydraulic pressure control system 
of an automatic transmission for a vehicle will be 
described with reference to Fig. 8 which shows a 
conventional hydraulic control system comprising a 
torque converter 1 attached to the engine through the 
engine flexible plate, and rotating at engine speed for 
transmitting power of the engine to an input shaft of 
the transmission gear mechanism, a damper clutch control 
valve 2 for controlling the application and release of 
a damper clutch to increase the power train efficiency 
inside the torque converter 1, a regulator valve 5 for 
regulating the output hydraulic pressure
