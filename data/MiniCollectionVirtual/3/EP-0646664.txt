<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for the sharing of a first machine between at least two machines which, in the production line for a product, must be adjacent to the first machine approximately in a parting plane, comprising means for displacing the single machine, with:   - on the one hand, each machine, between which the single machine (2) is shared, which has one fraction (5a) of a means (5) for guiding in translational movement and, - on the other hand, the shared machine (2) which carries a complementary fraction (5b) of the guide means (5).   It is characterised in that:   - the means (3) for displacing the single machine (2) comprise means (4) for supporting the said single machine, and - the guide means are designed to act only when the complementary fractions (5a, 5b) are in proximity to one another.
