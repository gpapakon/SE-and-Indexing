<ABSTRACT>
An airbrush (10) which comprises a handle (12) and a front body (14) is 
provided. The handle (12) and the front body (14) together define a tubular 

cavity through which air may travel. The air brush (10) defines a 
longitudinal axis. The front body (14) is rotationally connected to the 

handle (12) in such a way that the tubular cavity is in communication 
through the handle (12) and the front body (14) as the front body (14) is rotate 

about the longitudinal axis of the airbrush (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a novel airbrush which can be 
selectively gravity and siphon fed. Airbrushes have generally been available in two basic forms, 
gravity fed and siphon fed, Further, within these forms, a 
plethora of sizes of airbrushes are also available. A gravity fed airbrush generally has a receptacle or cup in 
which relatively small amounts of paint can be placed. The 
receptacle can generally be located anywhere above the point at 
which paint exits the airbrush and works by paint dripping into the 
airbrush. A siphon fed airbrush generally has a larger receptacle 
or paint jar attached below the paint exit point and generally has 
a tube connecting the paint jar with the airbrush. The passage of 
air over the end of the tube causes a negative pressure in the 
tube, which coupled with the positive pressure in the paint jar, 
causes the paint to be literally sucked, or siphoned, from the 
paint jar into the airbrush. Gravity fed and siphoning airbrushes are generally used for 
different tasks. If a paint job requires a great deal of paint, 
the user generally must use a siphon fed airbrush as it allows for 
more paint to be available. If greater painting precision is 
desired, the user will generally choose a gravity fed airbrush as 
the lighter weight paint receptacle and the availability of all of  
 
the air to push paint, rather than sucking paint, allows more 
precise movements and accuracy. As a result of these limited uses 
of each type of airbrush, the user must buy both types of 
airbrushes if he wishes to do large and small jobs. In addition, 
if the user has need of different sizes of airbrushes, he must then 
buy the different sizes in both gravity and siphoning types. The 
result is a large collection of different size and type airbrushes 
which must be prepared and then cleaned. I have invented a novel type of airbrush that allows the use 
of one airbrush as both a gravity fed and siphon fed airbrush. In 
this way, only half as many airbrushes need be bought, prepared, 
used and cleaned to make a complete set. Further, if the user is 
doing a large job and then wishes to work with greater accuracy, 
the airbrush of the present invention may be easily converted from 
a siphoning airbrush to a gravity fed airbrush and vice versa. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
an airbrush that can be selectively fed paint through a siphon or 
by gravity. It is a further object of the present invention to allow a 
wide variety of painting options with half
