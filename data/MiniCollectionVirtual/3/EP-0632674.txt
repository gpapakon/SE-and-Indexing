<ABSTRACT>
A diaphragm for use with an electro-acoustic 
transducer includes a diaphragm portion (1), an edge portion (2) and a 

supporting portion (3). The diaphragm portion (1) is molded by a 
synthetic resin material, such as polypropylene or the like. 

The edge portion (2) is molded integrally with the supporting 
portion by a thermoplastic synthetic resin material and provided 

at the outer peripheral side of the diaphragm portion. The edge 
portion (2) is molded integrally with the diaphragm portion (1) by 

dichromatic molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a diaphragm for use
with an electro-acoustic transducer
and, more particularly, to a method of producing a diaphragm for use with an
electro-acoustic transducer
by using synthetic resin materials.As background to the invention a known method of producing a diaphragm
for use with an electro-acoustic transducer will be described below with reference to
Figures 1a to 1d and Figures 2a to 2c of the accompanying drawings. The above-mentioned
diaphragm for use with an electro-acoustic transducer will be referred to
hereinafter simply as "diaphragm".Initially, a member 31 of substantially truncated cone
configuration shown in FIGURE 1a is produced. The substantially
truncated cone-shaped member 31 is produced by some suitable
methods, such as sheet-making of paper and pulp, pressing of
polymer film under heating or injection-molding of olefin
thermoplastic resin. The substantially truncated cone-shaped
member 31 is cut out at its portion shown by a one-dot chain
line in FIGURE 1a to provide an outer diameter portion 32 and a
bottom portion 33. As a result, the member 31 is manufactured
as a cone-shaped diaphragm member 34 shown in FIGURE 1b. A member 37 of substantially saucer configuration
shown in FIGURE 1c is produced by heating and molding a
material, such as cotton cloth, rubber, polyurethan foam,
elastomer or the like. The substantially saucer-shaped member
37 is cut out at its positions of diameters A and B shown by
one-dot chain lines in FIGURE 1c to provide an outer peripheral
portion and an inner peripheral portion.As a consequence, the substantially saucer-shaped
member 37 is manufactured as an annular-shaped edge member 38
shown in FIGURE 1d. The edge member 38 includes an edge portion
38a of substantially U-shaped cross section. To join the
diaphragm member 34 and the edge member 38 thus formed, the
diaphragm member 34 is coated at its outer surface portion of
the outer peripheral side with an adhesive 35 as shown in FIGURE
2a. Then, the edge member 38 is positioned on a mold 41 by
engaging the edge portion 38a of the edge member 38 with a
protrusion 41a of the mold 41 of the molds 40 and 41. Under
this condition, an opening portion 34a of the diaphragm member
34 is fitted onto a columnar portion 41b by downwardly inserting
the diaphragm member 34 into the mold 41. The diaphragm member
34 is positioned on the mold 41. Subsequently, the mold is
closed by lowering the mold 40 of the molds 40, 41 in FIGURE 2b,
and the diaphragm 34 and the edge

<CLAIMS>
A method of molding a diaphragm for use with an electro-acoustic
transducer, said diaphragm having a diaphragm portion (1) and an edge portion (2) joined by

mutually overlying portions (1a, 2b) at an outer peripheral side of the diaphragm
portion (1), the method comprising:


a first step of molding in a first cavity (8) a first one of the diaphragm portion (1)
and the edge portion (2); and
a second step of molding in a second cavity (10) the second one of the diaphragm
portion (1) and the edge portion (2) to the first one of said molded diaphragm portion

(1) and edge portion (2) to join said mutually overlying portions (1a, 2b) of the diaphragm
portion (1) and the edge portion (2) at said outer peripheral side of the diaphragm

portion (1);

   characterised in that

the method is performed using a mold (5, 6, 7) having a movable mold
member (7) which is movable from a first position, where the movable mold member

(7) closes off the second cavity (10) and overlaps the first cavity (8) to define the part of the
first cavity (8) which molds the overlying portion (1a; 2b) of the first one of the

diaphragm portion (1) and the edge portion (2), to a second position, where the
movable mold member (7) defines the part of the second cavity (10) which molds the

overlying portion (2b; 1a) of the second one of the diaphragm portion (1) and the
edge portion (2), and
the first molding step is performed with the movable mold member (7) in its
first position and the second molding step is performed with the movable mold

member in its second position.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the second molding step is
performed before the molding material injected into the first cavity (8) in the first

molding step has solidified completely.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a supporting portion (3) 
for supporting said edge portion is molded together with the edge portion (2) by the

one of the first or second molding steps in which the edge portion (2) is molded.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the supporting portion is a
gasket (3).
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
first one of the diaphragm portion (1) and the edge portion (2) is the diaphragm

portion (1) and the second one of the diaphragm portion (1) and the edge portion (2) is
the edge portion (2).
