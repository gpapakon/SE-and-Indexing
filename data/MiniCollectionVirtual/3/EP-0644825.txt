<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the manufacture of a length of closed film product from a length of flexible, flat film (12) is arranged on a support frame which supports a film forming collar (10) that is connected to a tubular member (24) for receipt of the formed tubular film. A heat sealer (26) engages overlapping elongate edges of the film are provided along the tubular member and a vacuum transport assembly is positioned on each side of the tubular member for moving and transporting the tubular film along the tubular member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved mechanism for 
transporting flexible film which is formed from a flat 
sheet into a tubular form. More specifically, the 
invention relates to the apparatus for transporting the 
formed tube of film when the edges of the tube are 
overlapped and are being sealed by a heating mechanism 
for example. In US-A-5,085,036, there is disclosed a mechanism 
which is used to form a flat sheet of flexible film into 
a tubular shape and for transporting that tubular shape 
along a cylindrical tube as the overlapping edges of the 
film are sealed or adhered one to the other. The 
mechanism is especially useful in the food packaging 
industry wherein the tubular flexible film, upon being 
formed and sealed, is filled with a food product in a 
continuous operation. Other package making machines are 
described in US-A-4,043,098 and US-A-4,974,396. From US-A-5,085,036, it is known to provide 
apparatus for the manufacture of a length of closed, 
film product from a length of a flexible, flat film 
comprising, in combination: 
(a) a support frame; (b) a film forming collar having an inlet side for 
receipt of a length of flat, flexible film and for 
folding the film into a tubular shape with opposite 
elongate edges of the film overlapping, said collar 
also having a discharge end; (c) a tubular member supported by the frame for 
receiving the tubular shaped film with overlapping 
edges from the discharge end of the collar; (d) means for adhering the overlapping elongate edges 
positioned along the tubular member by engaging the  
 
seam defined by the overlapping edges as the film 
traverses the tubular member; and (e) a transport means for transporting the tubular film 
along the tubular member, said transport means 
including at least one continuously moving means in 
opposed relation to the tubular member and moveable 
along a length of the member to thereby attach to 
the film and transport the film coincident with 
operation of the means for adhering, said moving 
means comprising rollers and an endless belt, said 
endless belt being fitted over the rollers and 
positioned in opposed relation to the pathway of 
the film along the tubular member. In US-A-5,085,036, the formed film is transported 
along a tubular mandrel by means of an endless belt or 
endless series of belts which frictionally engage the 
film and transport it along the tubular member as 
another endless belt which is heated, heat seals the 
overlapping edges of the film. The described apparatus 
is extremely

Apparatus for the manufacture of a length of closed, 
film product from a length of a flexible, flat film 

comprising, in combination: 

(a) a support frame; 
(b) a film forming collar (10) having an inlet side 
(20) for receipt of a length of flat, flexible film 

(12) and for folding the film into a tubular shape 
with opposite elongate edges (16,18) of the film 

overlapping, said collar also having a discharge 
end (22); 
(c) a tubular member (24) supported by the frame for 
receiving the tubular shaped film (12) with 

overlapping edges from the discharge end of the 
collar; 
(d) means (26) for adhering the overlapping elongate 
edges positioned along the tubular member by 

engaging the seam defined by the overlapping edges 
as the film traverses the tubular member; and 
(e) a transport means (36,38) for transporting the 
tubular film along the tubular member, said 

transport means including at least one continuously 
moving means (46,54,56) in opposed relation to the 

tubular member and moveable along a length of the 
member to thereby attach to the film and transport 

the film coincident with operation of the means for 
adhering, said moving means comprising rollers 

(42,44) and an endless belt (40), said endless belt 
being fitted over the rollers and positioned in 

opposed relation to the pathway of the film along 
the tubular member, characterised in that said 

transport means (36,38) is a vacuum transport means 
(36,38) and said at least one continuous moving 

means (46,54,56) is a continuous moving suction 
means, said suction means comprising a suction 

manifold (54) extending along the tubular member,  
 

said rollers (42,44) being positioned at the 
opposite ends of the manifold, and said endless 

belt (40) having a series of spaced apertures (46) 
therethrough and slidable over the manifold, said 

belt being positioned between the manifold and the 
tubular member, and said manifold having a vacuum 

passage in communication therewith, and in that one 
of said rollers defines a drive sprocket which 

engages the said apertures of the belt in 
sequential order as the belt passes over the drive 

sprocket to thereby drive the belt along the 
manifold while vacuum is effected through said 

apertures opposed to the manifold to simultaneously 
hold the film against the belt whereby the film is 

transported along the tubular member. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the vacuum 
transport means (36,38) comprise a first and second 

transport assemblies on opposite sides of the tubular 
member (24). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
means for adhering (26) includes heating means 

positioned in opposed relation to the tubular member 
(24), and wherein the tubular member includes a 

longitudinal rib (34) projecting from the tubular member 
and aligned with the seam and the means for adhering. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the manifold (54) includes an elongate slot 

vacuum passage (56) along a partial run of the belt (40) 
opposed to the tube (24). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the heating means (26) comprise an endless band 

synchronized to move substantially simultaneously at the 
speed of the endless vacuum advance belt (40).
