<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic brake servo comprises a casing (10) enclosing a piston (20) composed of a boss (34) and skirt (32). The casing (10) defines a front chamber (16) permanently connected to a vacuum source and a rear chamber (18) selectively connected to the front chamber (16) or to the atmosphere by means of a valve member (60, 62) actuated by a control rod (54) capable of coming to rest, through the front face of a plunger (44), on the rear surface of a reaction disc (48) integral with a thrust rod (52). A return spring (84) for the control rod (54) is disposed between the piston (34) and the plunger (44), the valve member (60, 62) including a shutter co-operating with a first circular valve seat (44a) on the piston (20), the shutter (60, 62) including a flexible membrane (60) of a generally truncated cone shape, sealingly fitted by its outer peripheral edge to the piston (20). According to the invention, the flexible membrane (60) is sealingly connected by its inner peripheral edge to a rigid tubular part (62) sealingly sliding in a rear tubular part (22) of the piston (20).

Pneumatic brake-booster comprising a casing (10) 
inside which there is a piston (20) formed from a hub 

(34) and from a skirt (32) and which defines a front 
chamber (16) permanently connected to a vacuum source and 

a back chamber (18) selectively connected to the front 
chamber (16) or to the atmosphere by a valve means (60, 

62) actuated by a control rod (54) capable of pressing, 
by means of the front face of a plunger (44) on the back 

face of a reaction disk (48) securely fastened to a 
thrust rod (52), a return spring (84) for the control rod 

(54) being arranged between the piston (34) and the 
plunger (44), the valve means (60, 62) comprising a 

shutter interacting with a first circular valve seat 
(44a) formed on the plunger (44) and a second circular 

valve seat (20a) formed on the piston (20), the shutter 
(60, 62) comprising a flexible membrane (60) fixed in a 

leaktight manner by its outer peripheral edge to the 
piston (20), characterized in that the flexible membrane 

(60) is connected in a leaktight manner by its internal 
peripheral edge to a rigid tubular part (62) sliding in 

a leaktight manner in a back tubular part (22) of the 
piston (20). 
Booster according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the external diameter of the rigid tubular part (62) 

of the shutter (60, 62) is substantially equal to the 
diameter of a first shutter element (80) interacting with 

the first circular valve seat (44a) formed on the plunger 
(44). 
Booster according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the plunger (44) is formed with a front tubular part 

(78) interacting by sliding in a leaktight manner with 
the piston (20). 
Booster according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the tubular front part (78) of the plunger (44) 

slides in a leaktight manner in the piston (20), the 
external diameter of the tubular front part (78) of the 

plunger (44) being substantially equal to the diameter of  
 

a first shutter element (80) interacting with the first 
circular valve seat (44a) formed on the plunger (44). 
Booster according to Claims 2 and 4, characterized 
in that the external diameter of the tubular 

front part (78) of the plunger (44) is substantially 
equal to the external diameter of the rigid tubular part 

(62) of the shutter (60, 62). 
Booster according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the tubular front part (78) of the plunger (44) 

slides in a leaktight manner around the hub (34) of the 
piston (20), the internal diameter of the tubular front 

part (78) of the plunger (44) being substantially equal 
to the diameter of a first shutter element (80) interacting 

with the first circular valve seat (44a) formed on 
the plunger (44). 
Booster according to Claims 2 and 6, characterized 
in that the internal diameter of the tubular front 

part (78) of the plunger (44) is substantially equal to 
the external diameter of the rigid tubular part (62) of 

the shutter (60, 62). 
Booster according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the plunger (44) comprises a front part (42) on 

which the front face of the plunger (44) is formed, 
interacting with the back face of the reaction disk (48), 

and a tubular front part (76) on which the first circular 
valve seat (44a) is formed, the front part (42) and the 

tubular part (76) of the plunger (44) being capable of 
moving axially with respect to one another. 
Booster according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the plunger comprises an annular part (74, 74') on
