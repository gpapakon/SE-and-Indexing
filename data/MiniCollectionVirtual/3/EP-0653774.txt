<ABSTRACT>
In an electron microscope for observing an image of 
a sample (8) using secondary electrons emitted from the 

sample by two-dimensionally scanning an electron beam 
(2) on the sample, a low magnification and wide view 

image of the sample is formed on one frame memory by 
dividing the frame memory for storing one picture of 

image into 16 areas and by storing the continuous image 
data of the surface of the sample obtained by moving 

said sample into each of said 16 divided areas of the 
frame memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanning
electron microscope and an image forming method
therewith.In the scanning electron microscope, the user can
observe an enlarged image at an optional location on the
sample on the monitor. Since the enlarged image is a
part of the sample, it requires a lot of time to select
the target field of view. When the sample is small, the
entire sample can be observed at a time by setting the
magnification ratio to the minimum magnification factor.
However, to search for the field of view, the field of
view is moved by stage movement through observation at
the minimum magnification factor.As a means for decreasing the minimum magnification
factor apparently, there is a method for displaying an
image at a very low magnification factor by stage
movement and connection on the frame memory as described
in Japanese Patent Publication No.4-74824 (1992). The
method comprises dividing the surface of a measuring
sample into a plurality of sections, scanning the
surfaces with an electron beam, recording the image data
for each section in each frame memory for one picture,
reducing each of the plural images recorded in the frame
memory, connecting the reduced images with each other to 
form and display a picture of very low magnification and
wide view image.Since very low magnification and wide view images
beyond the electron beam scanning width can be
displayed, such a prior art is effective in confirming
the position of the target section on the screen.
However, since image data is recorded in the frame
memory of divided sections and the images are reduced
and connected, to obtain very low magnification and wide
view images, the frame scanning time for the number of
divisions and the time for image reduction and
connection are required in addition to the stage moving
time, accordingly a very long period of time is
necessary. For example, in the case where the surface of
a sample is divided into 16 sections and the frame
memories of 16 in number are used, the time necessary to
form very low magnification factor images can be
expressed by the following formula.
[Forming time of very low magnification and wide view
image] = [15 times stage moving time] + [16 times frame
scanning time] + [16 times image reducing time] +
[connecting time].A memory for frames for the number of divisions is
necessary in addition to the very low magnification
factor image frame memory. In the example described
above, the necessary memory capacity is 17 frames
including very low magnification and wide
