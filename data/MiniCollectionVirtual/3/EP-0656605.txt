<ABSTRACT>
In a distance measuring device for calculating 
the distance from the arrival time of the Lamb wave, 

the thickness of the propagation plate and the frequency 
of the Lamb wave are optimized in relation to the 

material of the propagation plate in order not to 
deteriorate the precision of distance detection even 

in case an approximate wave velocity is used in the 
calculation. The plate thickness and the frequency 

are so selected, in relation to the plate material, 
as to minimize a function G(f, d) defined by:



G(f, d) = Vg·Vp/{f(Vg - Vp)} 



 
wherein 


f:
frequency 
 
Vg:
 
group velocity of Lamb wave 
 
Vp:
phase velocity of Lamb wave 
d:
plate thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coordinate
input device, and more particularly a device for
detecting the Lamb wave entered from a vibration source
into a vibration transmitting plate by means of plural
sensors provided on the vibration transmitting plate,
and measuring the distances from the vibration source
and the sensors based on the transmission time of the
Lamb wave entered by the vibration source into said
vibration transmitting plate.There is already known a method of calculating
the distance between two points utilizing ultrasonic
wave, and, as a specific application of such method,
there is also known a coordinate input apparatus as
disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 4,931,965. Such
apparatus is composed of a vibration transmitting plate
capable of transmitting the vibration and constituting
a coordinate input plane, a coordinate input pen capable
of generating vibration and constituting a coordinate
input instrument, plural sensors mounted on the
vibration transmitting plate for detecting the vibration,
and a circuit for signal processing and coordinate 
calculation.The apparatus is used for outputting the
coordinate of the position designated by the coordinate
input pen, to an information processing apparatus such
as a personal computer. The algorithm for calculating
the distance in the apparatus is constructed such that
the distances from the vibration source to the sensors
are at first determined on the basis of the arrival delay
time of the vibration wave and the velocity thereof, and
then the coordinate position is calculated in geometrical
manner. The above-mentioned conventional apparatus
utilizes a Lamb wave as the wave transmitting in the
vibration transmitting plate, and the distance L between
the vibration source and the sensor is determined by
the following equation:
L = Vp•Tp + N•λp
wherein:
Vp:phase velocityTp:phase delay timeλp:wavelength
and an integer N is determined by:
N = INT{(Vg•Tg - Vp•Tp)/λp + 0.5}
wherein:
Vg:group velocityTg:group delay time
which will be explained in detail in the embodiment
later.The precision of distance measurement depends
on the accuracy of detection of the phase delay time Tp 
and the group delay time Tg, but it also depends on
the preciseness of the constants employed in the
calculation, i.e. group velocity Vg, phase velocity
Vp and wavelength λp.The velocity of Lamb wave is known to be
generally dependent on the plate thickness d and the
frequency f of the Lamb wave. In the mass production
of the distance measuring device utilizing the Lamb
wa
