<ABSTRACT>
A resealable access site (10) is provided for allowing a cannula
(18) multiple accesses to an internal cavity (35) defined by a container

(12). The access site (10) includes a first conduit (28) defining a
passageway (29) forming a fluid path to the cavity within the container.

Sealingly attached to the conduit (28) is a housing (26) with a lower
portion (26a) and a lower flange (68) attached to a lower end of the lower

portion and extending radially inward from the lower portion. A septum
(24) is disposed and compressed within the lower portion, with the septum

defining an opening (46) extending upward through at least a portion of
the septum. The opening (46) is sized for insertion of the cannula (18)

through the septum (24) with the septum sealing about the exterior of the
cannula. The septum (24) is maintained in the housing by the support

provided by the opposing flange (68) and conduit (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a resealable access site for a fluid conveying conduit and more particularly relates to a resealable fluid access port for a fluid filled container such as a container containing fluid such as blood, medication or nutritional fluids which is to be provided to a patient.Frequently fluids are provided to a patient by establishing a connection between the patient and a container housing the fluids. For example, medication may be provided by establishing a connection between the venous system of the patient and a container housing the medication. The medication may be supplied singularly or in solution with another fluid such as a saline or dextrose solution. The connection between the container and patient is typically established with an intravenous ("I.V.") administration "set." One method of providing the needed medication is to place the medication in an I.V. solution container before the container is supplied to a health care provider. Additional methods may include providing a portion of the solution to the provider, and injecting a supplemental medication into the container just before or during administration of the container contents to the patient.Nutrition may also be provided to a patient by establishing a connection between a container containing nutritional fluid and a patient. The connection may be to a patient's venous or digestive system. During the "feeding" of a patient, supplemental fluids may need to be added to the container.The medical solution or nutritional containers are typically formed with at least one port which provides or defines a passageway to the fluid contained within the container. To prevent leakage of fluid through the port, the container must include some manner or means for sealing the port. Should the function of the port be such that it is intended for a single insertion of a piercing member, forming a part of the administration set, to establish a fluid connection between the container and the set, the sealing member may take the form of a membrane stretched across the passageway. The piercing member may be referred to as a "spike". These types of ports are typically referred to as administration or "admin" ports.It is also frequently necessary to establish intermittent access to the container fluid for the removal or addition of fluids such as medication or nutritional supplements to the container contents. The intermittent addition/removal port is sometimes referred to as the "med" port or site. In this instance, the

<CLAIMS>
An access site (10) for allowing a cannula (18) multiple accesses to a fluid passageway (29), the site comprising;

a first flexible conduit (28) having a lower portion (28a) defining the passageway (29), a lower end of the lower portion forming a ring shaped land area (64);
a housing (26) including a lower portion having an upward extending inner surface (40), a radially extending flange (68) attached to a lower end (26a) of the lower portion and extending inward from the lower portion, the housing (26) also including an upper portion (26b), the lower portion of the first conduit (28) being sealingly attached to the upper portion (26b) of the housing (26) ; and
a septum (24; 90, 110) compressingly disposed within the lower portion of the housing (26), the septum (24, 90, 110) defining an opening (46, 106) extending upward through at least a portion of the septum, the opening (46, 106) sized for sealed insertion of the cannula (18) through the septum, the septum (24, 90, 110) having an upper surface (48) with an upper outer circumferential edge portion (66) and a lower surface (50) with a lower outer circumferential edge portion (70), the land area (64) being in close proximity to the upper edge portion and the
 radial flange (68) extending over the lower edge portion to define a target access opening (74) to the septum (24, 90, 110).
