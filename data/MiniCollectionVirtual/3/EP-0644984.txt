<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pressure-intensifying apparatus of the double-acting type has end check valve assemblies (25, 25a). Each assembly has an inner low pressure poppet (100) communicable with the high pressure chamber (30) of the apparatus, and an outer high pressure ball poppet (110) communicable with a high pressure fluid outlet line (57). The check valve assembly (25) is designed for service accessibility without having to dismantle the intensifier. The apparatus includes a cylindrical housing (10) within which low and high pressure piston assemblies (28, 30, 30a) are confined by threaded end rings (12, 12a) under compression.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high pressure fluid intensifier 
systems. More particularly, this invention relates to check 
valve assemblies for controlling fluid flow into and out of 
the high pressure intensifier chamber. In a typical high pressure fluid intensifier system, 
hydraulic fluid acts on a reciprocating double-acting, low 
pressure-high pressure piston assembly to compress water to 
over several thousand psi. The piston assemblies of such 
systems are exposed to hydraulic fluid pressures on the order 
of 2,000 psi and to outlet water pressures on the order of 20-60,000 
psi. These assemblies must be designed to withstand 
tremendous pressure fluctuations while at the same time 
maintain hydraulic fluid/water separation. The inlet and outlet valve members of the pressurized 
fluid check valve assembly and their valve seats are severely 
stressed. Replacement of the valve members and their seats 
periodically is difficult because of the attachment of the 
various members making up the intensifier pressure chambers 
and piston assembly. Usually, the intensifier must be 
completely dismantled to reach and repair or replace such 
internal elements. In my U.S. Patent No., 4,818,194, I describe a check 
valve assembly that is designed to be accessible for service 
without dismantling the intensifier appurtenant thereto. In 
this patent, the check valve assembly is so arranged that the 
high pressure water outlet portion is provided at the outer 
end of the assembly adapter. In this design, removal of the 
adapter exposes the high pressure valve element and its seat 
for service or replacement. Also in this design, the inner 
low pressure end of the check valve assembly, which requires 
service less often, is accessible when the entire assembly is 
removed from the intensifier. A check valve retainer ring 
secures the assembly to the intensifier, in this design, and 
the retainer ring is easily removed so that the check valve  
 
assembly can be removed without dismantling the 
intensifier. When the various parts are serviced or 
replaced, it is a simple matter, in this design to reinstall 
the check valve assembly in full working 
condition, without having to be concerned about the 
relative alignment of the other components that make up 
the complete intensifier system. According to the present invention a fluid pressure 
intensifying apparatus comprises: 
a) a low pressure-high pressure cylinder means 
providing a cylindrical low pressure chamber and a pair of 
elongated cylindrical high pressure
