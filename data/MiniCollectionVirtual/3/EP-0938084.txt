<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reproduction apparatus
and a reproduction method which can play back both of a
first optical disc wherein wobbles of a first
predetermined frequency are formed on the opposite side
faces of a groove or a land and a second optical disc
wherein wobbles of a second predetermined frequency are
formed on one side face of a groove or a land.Conventionally, a disc called mini disc (Mini Disc:
trademark) is known wherein grooves wobbled at a
predetermined frequency are provided in advance on a
magneto-optical disc of a diameter of 64 mm and data are
recorded on the wobbled grooves.The mini disc mentioned above has address
information recorded in a predetermined modulated
condition on the grooves. Access control for the mini
disc or retrieval of a recordable area of the mini disc
is performed based on the address information.The mini disc described above allows recording of a
compressed audio signal for 74 minutes in the maximum and 
is considerably superior in convenience because it is
superior in portability and exhibits a high access rate.
A mini disc for an audio use may be hereinafter referred
to simply as MD-DA (Mini Disc Digital Audio).However, since the mini disc described above only
has a limited recording capacity of FE production circuit
140 Megabytes, it is not sufficient to record a video
signal thereon.Further, while a format called MD-DATA1 is known as
a format to be used to record computer data onto the mini
disc, it is disadvantageous in that the rate in re-writing
and reproduction operations is low because the
recording density of it is as low as FE production
circuit 140 Megabytes and the minimum recording data
length is comparatively large.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a reproduction apparatus and a reproduction method by
which servo controls suitable for different magneto-optical
discs can be performed to allow reproduction of
both of a magneto-optical disc having the conventional
data format MD-DA and MD-DATA1 and another magneto-optical
disc having the new data format MD-DATA2 for 
higher density recording.In order to attain the object described above,
according to an aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a reproduction apparatus for selectively playing
back a first optical disc wherein two side faces of each
of grooves or lands formed thereon are wobbled at a first
frequency and information is recorded on the wobbled
grooves or lands and a second optical disc wherein one of
two side faces of each of grooves or lands formed
