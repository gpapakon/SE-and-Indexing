<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In the case of a refuse container having a refuse-container body on the upper edge of the front wall of which there is integrally moulded a suspension strip which delimits a downwardly open receiving hollow into which a chip holder capable of being equipped with a data carrier is arranged, it is to be achieved in a simple way that not only newly manufactured refuse containers but also those already in use can be retrofitted with a data carrier in the form of a chip. 2.2 According to the invention, the chip holder (16) comprises a profiled body (18) which is fitted, in closing fashion, into an insertion opening (15) of a leg (13) of the suspension rail (11), the leg being situated parallel or approximately parallel to the front wall of the refuse-container body. Integrally moulded on the chip holder (16) is at least one snap element in the form of a spring web (22, 23), the free end of which grips internally behind the edge delimiting the insertion opening (15). The profiled body (18) is additionally provided with a covering flange which bears externally on the edge delimiting the insertion opening (15). 2.3 The refuse container according to the invention is usable especially for domestic purposes.

A refuse container comprising a refuse container body, on the 
upper edge of the front wall (10) of which is formed a suspension bar 

(11) which has a horizontal limb (12) and a limb (13) parallel or 
approximately parallel to the front wall (10) of the refuse container 

body, which defines a downwardly open receiving cavity (14) and in which 
a chip holder (16) which can be fitted with a data carrier in the form of 

a chip is arranged, characterised in that the chip holder (16) includes a 
shaped body (18) which is fitted in an adjacent position below the 

horizontal limb (12) in closing relationship into an insertion opening 
(15) in the limb (13), that is parallel or approximately parallel to the 

front wall (10), of the suspension bar (11), and on which is formed at 
least one snap-engagement element (22, 23) whose free end engages at the 

inside behind the edge (13) defining the insertion opening (15). 
A refuse container according to claim 1 characterised in that 
each snap-engagement element is in the form of a spring leg (22, 23). 
A refuse container according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the shaped body (18) has a cover flange (19) which on the outside bears 

against the edge defining the insertion opening (15). 
A refuse container according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the insertion opening (15) is in the form of a slot, angular or round. 
A refuse container according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the chip holder (16) is in the form of a 

one-piece shaped plastics portion and is formed from a receiving pot (17) 
and the shaped body (18) and that spring legs (22, 23) are formed on two 

mutually oppositely disposed sides of the receiving pot (17). 
A refuse container according to one or more of preceding claims 
1 to 5 characterised in that the functional parts of the chip are fitted 

directly into and for example cast in the chip holder (16) so that the 
casing of the chip is formed by the adjoining parts of the chip holder 

(16).  
 
A refuse container according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the receiving pot (17) of the chip holder (16) is designed in the manner 

of a ring with end faces open at both sides, and that the inside surface 
has a profiling (25) which fixes the inserted chip in positively locking 

and/or force-locking engagement. 
A refuse container according to claim 7 characterised in that 
the profiling (25) is a female screwthread (26). 
A refuse container according to claim 7 characterised in that 

the profile (25) is at least in the form of a head (27) which extends 
around the periphery or which extends over predetermined angular regions 

and which engage into a corresponding groove in the wall of the inserted 
chip.
