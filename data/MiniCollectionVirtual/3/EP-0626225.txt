<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the differential transmission of force and travel (course) from driving means (23) towards first (21) and second (22) means to be controlled, comprising compensation means (40) interposed between the previous means. According to the invention, the compensation means (40) comprise at least one block which can move along the surface of the driving means transmitting the force, which is in contact with two respective surfaces (31, 32) of the first and second means to be controlled, whose orientation, relative to the surface transmitting the force, is a function of the forces to be transmitted to these means. Application to any apparatus for holding (clamping) mechanical components.

Device for the differential transmission of force 
and of travel from driving means (23) to first (21) and 

second (22) means to be controlled, comprising compensation 
means (40) interposed between the said driving means 

and the said means to be controlled and arranged so as to 
allow either the transmission to the said means to be 

controlled of forces of different strength, or them to be 
given different travels, the said driving means (23) 

having a transmission surface (33) by means of which they 
impart a force (F) to the said compensation means (40, 

81), characterized in that these compensation means 
comprise at least one block (40, 81) mounted so that it 

can move along the said transmission surface and bearing 
thereon, the said first (21) and second (22) means to be 

controlled respectively have two transmission surfaces 
(31, 32) juxtaposed with one another, each having, with 

respect to the transmission surface (33) of the driving 
means, a given orientation which is a function of the 

force (F
1
, F
2
) to be transmitted respectively to the said 
first and second means to be controlled, the said block 

(40) being in contact with each of the transmission 
surfaces (31, 32) of the means to be controlled (21, 22). 
Device according to Claim 1, in which the said 
block (40) has a first surface (41) for interacting with 

the said transmission surface (33) of the driving means 
and a second surface (42, 43) for interacting with the 

transmission surfaces (31, 32) of the means to be controlled, 
the said second surface having, with respect to 

the first surface, the same orientation as that of the  
 

transmission surfaces (31, 32) of the means to be 
controlled. 
Device according to Claim 2, in which the said 
driving means comprise a disc (33) having several radial 

slots (34) distributed about an axis thereof and emerging 
on a front face of the disc, and several blocks (40) 

carrying a projecting peg (45) on their first surface 
(41), the blocks being arranged facing the slots in such 

a way that their first surface bears against the said 
front face of the disc and that their peg extends into 

the slot. 
Device according to Claim 3, in which the said 
first means to be controlled comprise a tube (22) coaxial 

with the disc (33) and able to move along the axis, 
which, at one end, has a surface (32) designed to interact 

with the second surfaces (42) of all of the blocks 
(40). 
Device according to Claim 4, in which the said 
tube (22) has an outer surface the diameter of which 

varies along the axis in such a way as to form a cam 
surface (57) interacting with a follower (51) mounted so 

that it can move radially opposite the cam surface (57). 
Device according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, in 
which the said second means to be controlled comprise 

several followers (92, 96) extending substantially in 
several diametral planes about the axis of the disc (33), 

while forming an angle with this axis, the said followers 
being mounted so they can move in terms of translation 

and interacting respectively, via an end surface, with 
the said second surfaces (43) of the blocks (40). 
Device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in which 
the said compensation means comprise first blocks (105 to 

108) arranged in a row in a groove and second blocks 
(104) nested between them in such a way that they interact 

with one another, a number of rods (101 to 103) 
extending transversely to the groove and interacting 

respectively via one end with the said second blocks 
(104). 
Device according to Claim 7, in which the said  
 

means to be controlled consist of the said rods (101 to 
103), the said driving means interacting simultaneously 

with all the first blocks (105 to 108). 
Device according to Claim 7, in which the said 
driving means consist of one (133) of the said rods, the 

means to be controlled consisting of all the other rods 
(131, 132). 
Device according to Claim 2, which comprises a 
main block (126) mounted so that it can slide along a 

first axis, the said first surface of which interacts 
with the driving means and the second surface of which 

interacts respectively with the first surfaces of two 
secondary blocks (127, 128) mounted so that they can 

slide along second and third axes which are parallel to 
each other and perpendicular to the said first axis, the 

second surface of each secondary block interacting 
respectively with the ends of two rods (121, 122; 123, 

124) constituting the said means to be controlled.
