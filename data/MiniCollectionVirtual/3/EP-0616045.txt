<ABSTRACT>
Silicide targets for sputtering which have an area ratio 
of silicon phases that appear on the sputter surface of no 

more than 23%, and a density of at least 99%, with a 
deformed layer partly removed from the surface to attain a 

surface roughness of from more than 0.05 µm to 1 µm, 
preferably with the number of coarse silicon phases at least 

10 µm in diameter that appear on the sputter surface being 
at most 10/mm². The reduction of early-stage particle 

generation, in turn, reduces secondary particle generation, 
thus realizing the reduction of particle generation at both 

early stage and stabilized stage. A Si powder having a 
maximum particle diameter of no more than 20 µm is mixed with 

a metal powder having a maximum particle diameter of no more 
than 60 µm, in a rather Si-lower mixing ratio. A silicide 

powder is synthesized from the mixture and hot pressed, the 
sintered compact being machined and surface treated for the 

removal of the deformed layer. The burden of the deformed 
layer-removal step on the process is light.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silicide targets for sputtering 
and a method of manufacturing the same whereby the number of 
particles that generates from the target in sputtering and 
deposits on a substrate such as a wafer can be highly 
decreased from the prior art level. The silicide films formed 
by sputtering process using the silicide targets of this 
invention are useful for the films of large-scale integrated 
circuits that involve very narrow conductor lines. They are 
used in semiconductor devices such as new, higher integration 
extent (e.g., 4, 16, and 64-megabit) LSIs and VLSIs. Polysilicon has hitherto been used in electrodes or 
conductors of LSI semiconductor devices. The tendency toward 
higher integration of LSI semiconductor devices has caused to 
present the problem of delay in signal transmission due to 
its resistance. Meanwhile, there is a demand for higher-melting 
materials to be used as electrodes to facilitate the 
formation of conductors etc. by self-alignment technique.  
 
Under these circumstances, conductors and electrodes of metal 
silicides that possess lower electric resistivity than 
polysilicon and are compatible with the silicon gate process 
have come into use. Examples of the metal silicides are 
tungsten silicide (WSix), molybdenum silicides (MoSix), 
tantalum silicides (TaSix), titanium silicides (TiSix), 
cobalt silicides (CoSix), chromium silicides (CrSix), nickel 
silicides (NiSix), and silicides of platinum group metals. A film of such a metal silicide is formed by sputtering a 
target of the metal silicide. The silicide target used often 
has a silicon/metal molar ratio greatly in excess of 2, 
because when a molar ratio x is less than 2, stresses in the 
film becomes higher as the film is formed and the film tends 
to peel away from a substrate. Metal silicide targets are manufactured by mixing silicon 
powder and a specific metal powder in a silicon/metal molar 
ratio of 2 or more, synthesizing the mixture to a synthesized 
silicide powder, compressing and sintering the synthesized 
silicide powder, and then machining the sintered body to a 
desired shape. The recent rise in the extent of integration of LSI 
semiconductor devices (e.g., to 4, 16, and 64-megabits) has 
reduced the width of their conductor lines finely to submicron 
levels. With this tendency the particles generated from the 
target are attracting attention as a subject of growing  
 
concern. The term "particles" as used herein means the 
particulate matters scattered and flew around from a
