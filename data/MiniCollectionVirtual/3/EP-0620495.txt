<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a compact photographic 
processor which uses small volumes of processing 

solution to achieve effective processing without the 
need for process control. The processor comprises an 

applicator element (50) having a plurality of orifices 
formed along its length, a plurality of reservoirs 

(54, 56, 58) each containing processing solution, and 
a pressure system (60, 61, 62). The element (50) is 

connected to one side of the reservoirs (54, 56, 58) 
by means of a manifold (52), the other side of the 

reservoirs (54, 56, 58) being connected to the 
pressure system (60, 61, 62). The processing 

solutions may be dispensed from the element (50) as 
jets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
photographic processing apparatus and is more 
particularly, although not exclusively, concerned with 
the processing of photographic materials using redox 
amplification chemistry. Redox amplification processes have been 
described, for example in GB-A-1 268 126, 
GB-A-1 399 481, GB-A-1 403 418 and GB-A-1 560 572. In 
such processes colour materials are developed to 
produce a silver image (which may contain only small 
amounts of silver) and then treated with a redox 
amplifying solution (or a combined developer-amplifier) 
to form a dye image. The developer-amplifier solution contains a 
reducing agent, for example, a colour developing 
agent, and an oxidising agent which will oxidise the 
colour developing agent in the presence of the silver 
image which acts as a catalyst. The photographic 
material used in such a process may be a conventional 
coupler-containing silver halide material or an image 
transfer material containing redox dye releasers. Oxidised colour developer reacts with a 
colour coupler (usually contained in the photographic 
material) to form image dye. The amount of dye formed 
depends on the time of treatment or the availability 
of colour coupler rather than the amount of silver in 
the image as is the case in conventional colour 
development processes. Examples of suitable oxidising agents 
include peroxy compounds including hydrogen peroxide 
and compounds which provide hydrogen peroxide, eg 
addition compounds of hydrogen peroxide; cobalt (III)  
 
complexes including cobalt hexammine complexes; and 
periodates. Mixtures of such compounds can also be 
used. A particular application of this technology 
is in the processing of silver chloride colour paper, 
especially such paper with low silver levels. However, as the chemistry used in redox 
amplification processes are inherently unstable, it is 
uneconomic to use large volumes of processing 
solutions. WO-A-91/12567 discloses a method for 
processing photographic material using a redox 
amplification process using the minimum of processing 
solution whilst providing fully acceptable results. 
The photographic material is passed through a tank 
containing the unstable processing solution and the 
processing solution is circulated through the tank at 
a rate in the range of 0.1 to 10 tank volumes per 
minute, in particular between 2 and 4 tank volumes per 
minute. Ink-jet printers are generally well known. 
Printers of this type have print heads having very 
small nozzles and passageways
