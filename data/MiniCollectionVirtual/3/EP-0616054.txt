<ABSTRACT>
For this invention it is disclosed that 
aluminium electrode foil is caused to pass through any 

of nitric acid, sulfuric acid and mixed acid thereof 
each added with at least one selected from the group 

consisting of chromic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, 
phosphoric acid, boric acid, succinic acid and malonic 

acid as an additive and electrically etched in the 
etching process of a final stage for increasing the 

diameter of pits created in a preceding stage for 
etching to a diameter suitable for a forming voltage, 

and any of the nitric acid, sulfuric acid and mixed acid 
thereof controls the concentration of dissolved 

aluminium to 5 to 25g/l, whereby aluminium is dissolved 
along the inner wall of the pits while the surface 

dissolution of the aluminium electrode foil is 
suppressed, so that the diameter of the pits can be 

effectively increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing electrode foil for aluminium electrolytic 
capacitors, and more specifically, to an etching 
technology for anode aluminium foil used for medium and 
high voltage capacitors. Recently, as electronic appliance sets are 
miniaturized and their reliability are increased, the 
requirements for miniaturization and reduced costs of 
users for aluminium electrolytic capacitors are rapidly 
increasing. Thus, a capacitance per unit area of 
electrode foil for aluminium electrolytic capacitors 
(hereinafter, referred to as electrode foil) must be 
increased as compared with conventional ones. A conventional method of manufacturing 
electrode foil will be described below. Electrode foil is composed of aluminium foil 
whose effective surface area is increased by electro-chemically 
or chemically etching the aluminium foil for 
miniaturizing capacitors. Although various etching 
methods have been examined for increasing the surface 
area, it is generally achieved in such a manner that the  
 
aluminium foil is continuously put into several kinds of 
different etching baths and applied with a current or 
chemically dissolved in the respective baths to 
gradually increase the surface area of the aluminium 
foil and then finally washed. Especially, in case of 
the electrode foil used for medium and high voltage 
capacitors, etched pits (hereinafter, referred to as 
pits) formed in a preceding stage must be increased to a 
diameter suitable for a voltage in use in a succeeding 
stage and how to effectively increase pit diameters is 
an important consideration. Conventionally, pits are produced by electric 
etching in an acid solution containing chlorine ions in 
the preceding stage and the diameter of the pits is 
increased by chemical dissolution in an acid solution of 
high temperature in the succeeding stage. This method 
which relies on the chemical dissolution in the 
succeeding stage is liable to be affected by a difference 
(dispersion) of the dissolving property among the 
lots of raw foil and the diameter of pits cannot be 
uniformly increased. Thus, it is difficult to increase 
a capacitance of the electrode foil. With respect to 
this point, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication No. Hei 2-303018, Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication No. Hei 3-101213 and Japanese Patent 
Unexamined Publication No. Hei 3-136226, a technology
