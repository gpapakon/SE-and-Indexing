<ABSTRACT>
The system has an interrogating unit (AE) and a multiplicity of terminals (ZE). The control electronics (2) of each terminal (ZE) provide for a code input into a memory (3) of the terminal (ZE) and causes the terminal (ZE) only to switch to a ready-to-transmit state after detection of an interrogation signal from the interrogating unit (AE) but not due to an input effected by the operator. The interrogating units (AE), the stored code of which corresponds to the special interrogating signal or the time value, send a response signal due to special interrogating signals or counting values of an internal time base. The interrogating unit (AE) determines the number of persons who have entered a relevant code by measuring the power of all received signals.

terminal devices (ZE) corresponding to the plurality 

of persons, wherein 
each terminal device (ZE) comprises a battery (13), a 
keyboard (1), a memory (3), a non-direction-selective 

transmit-receive antenna (10), a receiver (11), a 
transmitter (8) and a control electronics (2), 
the interrogation unit comprises an antenna (24), a 
transmitter (22), a receiver (25), an evaluation circuit 

(26) and a control unit (20),

effected via the keyboard (1), 
 
characterized in 


that the interrogation unit (AE) transmits code interrogation 
signals, each of which contains information  

 
assigned to one of the various codes, in a time sequence, 
that those terminal devices (ZE) in whose memory (3) a 
code assigned to the information of the code interrogation 

signal has been stored transmit a response 
signal each time one of the code interrogation signals 

is received, and 
that in each instance the interrogation unit (AE) deduces 
the number of persons who have entered the code 

concerned from a measurement of the respective receiving 
power of the response signals received after 

transmission of each of the code interrogation signals.
