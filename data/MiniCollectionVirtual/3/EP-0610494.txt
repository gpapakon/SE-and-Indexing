<ABSTRACT>
A magnetoresistor (MR) and a non-magnetoresistor (NMR) are formed of indium antimonide or other magnetoresistive material in thermal proximity to each other on an integrated circuit substrate. Hall effect shorting strips (104) are formed on the magnetoresistor (MR) to make it much more magnetoresistive than the non-magnetoresistor (NMR). A current mirror (80) causes equal constant currents which do not vary with temperature to flow through the magnetoresistor (MR) and non-magnetoresistor (NMR), such that magnetoresistor and non-magnetoresistor voltages are developed thereacross respectively. The magnetoresistor and non-magnetoresistor voltages vary equally in accordance with temperature. The magnetoresistor voltage also varies in accordance with applied magnetic flux. A comparator (66) substracts the non-magnetoresistor voltage from the magnetoresistor voltage to produce an output signal (Vout) with the temperature variation cancelled, and which thereby varies only in accordance with magnetic flux. The current mirror (80) has an essentially infinite equivalent load impedance, such that the magnetoresistor voltage varies to a maximum possible extent with variation of the resistance of the magnetoresistor (MR) and the sensor (70) has a maximum possible output voltage swing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the sensing
of magnetic fields, and more specifically to a magnetoresistive
sensor suitable for fabrication using integrated
circuit technology which produces a high output voltage and
is insensitive to temperature variation.Magnetoresistive sensors are widely used for sensing
magnetic field flux, and more specifically translational
and rotational speed and position as analogous variations
of magnetic flux. A basic magnetoresistive sensor 10 of
known design is illustrated in FIG. 1, and includes a
magnetoresistor 12 which is connected in series with a
fixed resistor 14. A source voltage V+ is applied across
the resistors 12 and 14, whereas the junction of the
resistors 12 and 14 is connected to the non-inverting input
of an operational amplifier 16. A reference voltage VR1 is
applied to the inverting input of the amplifier 16.A toothed wheel 20 made of a ferromagnetic material
such as steel is mounted for integral rotation on a member
(not shown) whose rotational speed or position is to be
sensed. The wheel 20 may be mounted on a crankshaft of an
automotive vehicle, for example, for measuring engine speed 
(RPM), or on a wheel shaft for measuring vehicle speed.The magnetoresistor 12 is disposed between the wheel
20 and a magnet 22 such that a magnetic field is developed
between the wheel 20 and magnet 22, with the magnetic field
flux passing through the magnetoresistor 12. The resistance
of the magnetoresistor 12 increases as the magnitude
of the applied magnetic flux increases. The flux is
maximum when one of the teeth of the wheel 20 is aligned
with the magnet 22, and minimum when one of the gaps
between the teeth is aligned with the magnet 22.As the magnetic flux and thereby the resistance of the
magnetoresistor 12 increase, the voltage drop across the
magnetoresistor 12 increases and the voltage at the
junction of the resistors 12 and 14 and thereby at the non-inverting
input of the amplifier 16 decreases, and vice-versa.
The reference voltage VR1 is selected to be
equidistant between the minimum and maximum voltages
appearing at the junction of the resistors 12 and 14. The
amplifier 16 produces an output voltage Vout.As each tooth of the wheel 20 passes through alignment
with the magnet 22, the voltage at the non-inverting input
of the amplifier 16 crosses below the voltage at the
inverting input, and the amplifier 16 produces a negative
output voltage Vout. As each gap between teeth of the
wheel 20 passes through alignment with the magnet 22, the
voltage
