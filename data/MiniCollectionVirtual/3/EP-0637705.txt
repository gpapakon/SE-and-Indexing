<ABSTRACT>
In an infinitely variable traction roller 
transmission wherein two toric traction discs (20, 22) 

are rotatably supported opposite one another so as to 
define therebetween a toric cavity (24) in which at least 

two motion transmitting traction rollers (26, 28) are 
disposed in engagement with the toric discs (20, 22) and 

supported by trunnions (30) which are pivotally supported 
to permit changing the ratio of motion transmission 

between the toric discs (20, 22), each pivot trunnion 
(30) has a cylindrical cavity with a support piston disposed 

therein in axial alignment with the traction roller 
(26) supported on the trunnion (30) and a plurality of 

radial lever members are arranged around the axis of the 
support piston and rest on a fulcrum structure disposed 

around the cylindrical cavity and, at their inner end, on 
the support piston, and a bearing disc which carries the 

traction roller (26) is supported on the radial lever 
members at a location inwardly from the fulcrum structure 

to force the traction roller (26) into engagement with 
the toric discs (20, 22) with the piston force amplified 

by the radial lever members.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an infinitely variable traction 
roller transmission in which power is transmitted through traction 
rollers which are pivotally supported between toric input 
and output discs with which they are forced into firm engagement 
for the transmission of motion therebetween. An infinitely variable traction roller transmission in accordance 
with the features of the preamble of claim 1 is known 
from DE-A 2 847 919. In such transmissions, the traction rollers are mounted on 
support structures which, when pivoted, cause engagement of the 
traction rollers with the toric discs in circles of varying diameters 
depending on the desired transmission ratio. The support 
structures are generally trunnions which are supported in a 
housing in such a manner that they are either axially movable or 
slightly tiltable for initiating a change in the transmission 
ratio. To provide for slight axial movability, for example, two 
traction roller support trunnions may be supported opposite one 
another by flexible tension sheets as shown in US-A 4 086 820. 
To provide for slight tilting, traction roller support trunnions 
may be supported by a roller rolling along a partial circular 
track wherein one end of the trunnion is movable for tilting the 
trunnion in order to initiate a change in transmission ratio as 
disclosed in US-A 4 964 312. For the transmission of large torques the forces with which 
the traction rollers have to be engaged with the toric discs are 
rather large. They may be provided either by forcing the toric 
discs toward one another or by forcing the traction roller 
axially into the toric cavity formed between the toric discs. 
This may be accomplished hydraulically by an arrangement as 
shown, for example, in US-A 4 576 055.  
 It is desirable to produce the contact forces directly under 
the traction roller in axial direction of the traction 
roller such that the required fluid traction coefficient will 
remain relatively constant over the selected transmission ratio 
range. Then a relatively large ratio range can be accommodated 
without overloading the contact areas in the pivotal end positions 
of the trunnions. However since the required contact forces are very large 
and the space under a traction roller is quite limited, a large 
hydraulic fluid pressure is required to produce the needed contact 
forces. The large fluid pressures require high pressure 
pumps and high pressure seals which are expensive and more easily 
subject to failure than lower pressure components. It
