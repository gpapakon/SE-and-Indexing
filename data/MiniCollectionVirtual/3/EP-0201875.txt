<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed to a sheet product 
which is useful as separators in batteries, in particular, 
separators in lithium batteries to prevent the occurrence 
of overheating and thermal-runaway. Storage batteries have at least one pair of 
electrodes of opposite polarity and, generally, have a 
series of adjacent electrodes of alternating polarity. 
The current flow between these electrodes is maintained by 
an electrolyte which can be acid, alkaline or 
substantially neutral depending on the nature of the 
battery system. Separators are located in the batteries 
between adjacent electrodes of opposite polarity to 
prevent direct contact between the oppositely charged 
electrode plates while freely permitting electrolytic 
conduction. The separator is normally in the form of a 
thin sheet or film or in certain designs can be in the 
form of an envelope surrounding each electrode plate of 
one polarity. It is generally agreed that separators 
should be (a) thin and light weight to aid in providing a 
battery of high energy density, (b) resistant to 
degradation and instability with respect to the battery 
components with which it is in contact, (c) capable of 
exhibiting a high degree of electrolytic conductivity (low 
electrolytic resistance) and (d), in battery systems where 
appropriate, capable of inhibiting formation and growth of 
dendrites. Lithium batteries have distinct advantages over other 
storage batteries. These batteries are capable of 
providing much higher power storage densities than other 
types of batteries, excellent shelf life, high energy 
density (power capability per unit weight) due to the low 
atomic weight of lithium metal, and high potential for 
forming a battery in conjunction with positive electrodes  
 
far removed from the lithium electrode in the 
electromotive series. The battery can be formed in any 
conventional physical design-cylindrical, rectangular or 
disc-shaped "button" cells - normally of a closed cell 
configuration. Such batteries are generally composed of a 
negative lithium electrode, a positive electrode and a non 
aqueous electrolyte. The negative electrode is 
conventionally lithium metal or its alloy on a support, 
such as a nickel coated screen. Positive electrodes of 
various types have been suggested, including metal oxides 
such as manganese dioxide or transition metal sulfides 
such as sulfides of cobalt, nickel, copper, titanium, 
vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron. The positive 
electrode may further contain carbon and a current
