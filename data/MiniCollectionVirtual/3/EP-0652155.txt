<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for packaging food, chemical or pharmaceutical products simultaneously carries out thermoforming, loading with products and definitive manufacture of trays for packaging the products. The packaging trays include a cavity (8) for receiving products (P) and a protective cover (3), which are welded together, as well as a lid (9) made in a single piece with the cavity (8). Application to the packaging of food, chemical or pharmaceutical products.

Method for packaging food, chemical or
pharmaceutical products, comprising, in combination,

the following steps performed in the following order:

a) gripping hold of a first strip (2) of
thermoplastic or thermoformable material,
b) using thermoforming to shape (5) the first
strip (2) of thermoplastic in order simultaneously to

form an associated cavity (8) and lid (9),
c) filling the said cavity (8) with food,
chemical or pharmaceutical products (P),
d) sealing the said cavity (8) by welding of a
second strip (3) of thermoplastic or thermoweldable

material, so as to isolate the said food, chemical or
pharmaceutical products (P),
e) cutting in the first strip that was
thermoformed in step b) the outlines of the cavity (8)

and of the lid (9) so as to form a hinge (20) that will
allow the lid (9) to be closed onto the cavity (8)

sealed in step d), the said hinge being embodied by at
least two connecting points (23), each connecting point

being separated from an adjacent connecting point (23)
by a cutout in the form of a section of a straight line

(24).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first strip (2) of thermoplastic is preheated

(4) between steps a) and b).
Method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that, prior to step d), an at least 

partial vacuum is created inside the cavity (8) filled
with food, chemical or pharmaceutical products (P).
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that a neutral gas is also reinjected before the second

strip (3) of thermoplastic or thermoweldable material
is welded (12).
Tray for packaging food, chemical or
pharmaceutical products, of the type comprising a

cavity for containing the said products and a welded-on
seal, the cavity (8) being thermoformed at the same

time as a lid (9) that is formed integrally with this
cavity (8), the lid (9) being connected to the cavity

(8) by an articulating hinge (20), the articulating
hinge (20) being embodied by at least two connecting

points (23), characterized in that each connecting
point (23) is separated from an adjacent connecting

point (23) by a cutout in the form of a section of a
straight line (24).
Tray according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the cavity (8) is bounded on the same side as the

seal (3) by a flat rim (25) and in that the lid (9)
has, at least on the side opposite the region (20) of

continuity of material, a shaping (26) for clipping-together
with the said flat rim (25).
Tray according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the lid (9) has a shaping (26, 27, 28) for

clipping-together with the cavity (8).
Tray according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the clipping-together shaping extends

substantially over the entire free perimeter
(26, 27, 28) of the lid (9).
Device for packaging food, chemical or
pharmaceutical products, comprising, in combination,

means for gripping hold of a first strip (2) of
thermoplastic or thermoformable material; means (5) for

using thermoforming to shape the first strip (2) of
thermoplastic in order simultaneously to form an

associated cavity (8) and lid (9); means for filling
the said cavity (8) with food, chemical or 

pharmaceutical products (P); means for sealing the said
cavity (8) by welding of a second strip (3) of

thermoplastic or thermoweldable material, so as to
isolate the said food, chemical or pharmaceutical

products (P) ; and means for cutting in the first strip
the outlines of the sealed cavity (8) and of the lid

(9) so as to form a hinge (20) that will allow the lid
(9) to be closed onto the cavity (8), the said hinge

being embodied by at least two connecting points (23),
each connecting point being separated from an adjacent

connecting point (23) by a cutout in the form of a
section of a straight line (24).
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the means for gripping hold of the first strip (2)

comprise horizontal chains carrying spring clips.
Device according to Claim 9 or Claim 10,
characterized in that the means for using thermoforming

to shape the first strip (2) of thermoplastic comprise
a modular collection of shapers (31, 32) that

correspond to a lid (9) and a cavity (8) respectively.
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the shaper (31) corresponding to the lid (9) is

mounted in a fixed position relative to the body of the
thermoforming means.
Device according to Claim 11 or 12,
characterized in that the shaper (32) corresponding to

the cavity (8) can be moved relative to the body of the
thermoforming means under the action of a device

(33-36) that brings about translation (T).
Device according to one of Claims 9 to 13,
characterized in that the device comprises means (C) of

precutting the first strip (2) of thermoformable
material.
Device according to one of Claims 9 to 14,
characterized in that the device comprises means (A)

for cutting out sections (24) of a straight line so as
to form the articulating hinge (20).
