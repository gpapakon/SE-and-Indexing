<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for forming chain extended polymers and graft and block polymers and copolymers which comprises the steps of: (a) forming an intimate mixture of one or more polymers and one or more effective phosphorus (III) chain extension reagent compounds; wherein at least one of said effective chain extension reagents has bonded to the phosphorus (III) atom at least one group which is a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic moiety that is bonded through a nitrogen of the heteroaromatic moiety to the phosphorus (III) atom by a single bond; and (b) heating said mixture for a time and at a temperature sufficient to form said extended chain polymer or copolymer. Further embodiments relate to polymers and copolymers prepared in accordance with the process of this invention as well as articles formed from these polymers and polymer compositions comprising the polymeric materials of this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the process for coupling 
polymeric materials. More particularly, this invention 
relates to a process for preparing chain extended 
polymers and graft and/or block polymers and 
copolymers. Useful polymer reactants include 
polyamides and polyesters as well as other polymers as 
described herein. The process involves coupling the 
polymeric materials. Coupling as described above is 
referred to herein as a chain extension process. The 
polymers of this invention have increased molecular 
weights and/or melt viscosities. Polymers prepared in 
accordance with the process of this invention are 
capable of being fabricated into useful shaped articles 
of manufacture, e.g. filaments, both mono- and 
multifilament, films, tapes, ribbons, rods, containers, 
and laminates. U.S. Patent 4,568,720 to Aharoni discloses a 
process for preparing extended chain polyesters, and 
block or graft polyester or copolyesters by forming an 
intimate mixture of one or more polyesters and an 
effective amount of one or more chain extension reagent 
compounds, and thereafter heating the intimate mixture 
at a temperature and for a time sufficient to form the 
desired amount of the desired polyester or copolyester. 
Other patents such as 4,417,031; 4,433,116; 4,390,667; 
4,963,311 and 4,946,909 disclose chain extension, 
graft, and block polymers containing polyamides,  
 
polyesters and other related polymers. In accordance with this invention, there is 
provided a process for forming chain extended polymers 
and graft and block polymers and copolymers which 
comprises the steps of: 
   (a) forming an intimate mixture of one or more 
polymers and an effective amount of one or more 
effective phosphorus (III) chain extension reagent 
compounds; 
   wherein at least one of said effective chain 
extension reagents has bonded to the phosphorus (III) 
atom at least one group which is a nitrogen-containing 
heteroaromatic moiety that is bonded through a nitrogen 
of the heteroaromatic moiety to the phosphorus (III) 
atom by a single bond; and 
   (b) heating said mixture for a time and at a 
temperature sufficient to form said extended chain 
polymer or copolymer. A further embodiment of this invention relates to 
the a process for forming branched polymers. The 
branched polymers are formed by adding chain branching 
agents to the intimate mixture of step (a) described in 
the above process. Another embodiment of this invention relates to 
polymers and copolymers prepared in accordance with the 
process of
