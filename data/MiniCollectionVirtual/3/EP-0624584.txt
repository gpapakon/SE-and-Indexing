<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to piperazine derivativesor
salts thereof which are useful as a treating agent for
diseases in circulatory organs and the cerebral region.Some piperazine derivatives exhibit activities toward
the central nervous system, such as anti-anxiety activity and
anti-convulsive activity, as disclosed in U.S. Patent
3,362,956. It is also known that a certain kind of
piperazine derivatives possess calmodulin inhibitory activity
as reported in Arzneim.-Forsch., Vol. 37(4), pp. 498-502
(1987) and WO 94/07875.A further class of piperazine compounds is useful for
treatment and prophylaxis of cerebrovascular disorders, such
as cerebral stroke, cerebroarteriosclerosis, transient
ischemic attacks, myocard ischemia and high blood pressure,
see EP-A- 126 480.The piperazine derivatives represented by formula (I)
according to the present invention are novel compounds whose
physiological activity has not yet been reported.In recent years, diseases of circulatory organs or in
the cerebral region, such as hypertension, cardiac
insufficiency, angina pectoris, apoplexy, cerebral
infarction, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease,
have been increasing, and various drugs for prevention and
treatment of these diseases have been developed. On the
other hand, compounds with calmodulin inhibitory activity
have been discovered, and some of them have been revealed to
have antihypertensive activity and vasodilatory activity. An object of the present invention is to provide a
compound useful as treating agent for various diseases of
circulatory organs or the cerebral region, particularly those
diseases caused by excessive activation of calmodulin.As a result of extensive investigations, the present
inventors have succeeded in preparing novel piperazine
derivatives represented by formula (I) shown below and salts
thereof and have ascertained that these compounds have
calmodulin inhibitory activity, antihypoxia activity,
inhibitory activity on delayed neuronal death in the
hippocampus of merions (Merionesshawi), and improving
activity on cerebral edema. That is, the inventors have
elucidated that the compounds of formula (I) exhibit not only
calmodulin inhibitory activity but strong cerebral protective
activity.The present invention relates to a compound
represented by formula (I):
