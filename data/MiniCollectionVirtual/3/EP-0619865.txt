<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to burner control and,
more particularly to a burner apparatus incorporating a
thermoelectric sensor control device.LU-A-37 685 discloses a safety device for use with a gas
appliance that does not comprise an exhaust gas flue, such as a
small portable stove operating on butane gas. The safety device
comprises a carbon dioxide detector which includes an angle
bracket which carries three thermoelectric couples located
adjacent to a pilot light associated with the main burner of a
gas appliance. The three thermoelectric couples are located one
above the other and connected in series and present three
respective hot junctions and three respective cold junctions.
The two lower hot junctions are situated in the immediate
proximity of the pilot light outlet and in contact with the
normal flame of the pilot light. The uppermost hot junction is
positioned above the first two at a predetermined distance from
the pilot light outlet. The three cold junctions are distanced
laterally from both the hot junctions and the pilot light outlet.
When the air supply to the pilot light contains a normal or
acceptable proportion of carbon dioxide the pilot light flame
heats predominantly the two lower thermoelectric couples leaving
the uppermost couple virtually unheated. Under these conditions
the thermoelectric couples produce a normal voltage which allows
an electromagnetic valve via which fuel gas is supplied to the 
main burner and pilot light to remain open. As the proportion
of carbon monoxide rises, the flame lengthens and if the
proportion of carbon monoxide in the pilot flame increases beyond
a certain figure then the flame of the pilot light will lengthen
sufficiently to heat the hot junction of the uppermost
thermoelectric couple. The uppermost thermoelectric couple is
mounted, as regards voltage production, in opposition to the two
lower thermoelectric couples and its effect, when heated by the
lengthened flame, is subtracted from that of the normal voltage
produced by the two lower couples so that the effective voltage
drops considerably thereby causing the electromagnetic valve to
close and stop off the supply of fuel gas. As a result the gas
appliance is extinguished. If the pilot light goes out for any
reason, then the electromagnetic valve closes automatically.US-A-3224485 discloses a heat control device for controlling the
heat energy level or heat level within a vertical tubular member
into which a flame is emitted upwardly from a fuel fired torch.
