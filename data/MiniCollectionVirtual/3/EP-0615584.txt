Coupling device for coupling non-aligned rotating 
parts, having a driving-side coupling half and a 

driven-side coupling half (A and B, respectively), and 
a dividable intermediate coupling member (10), which is 

connected with the driving-side coupling half (A) 
through a first pair of mutually centro-symmetrically 

arranged links (12,14), and with the driven-side 
coupling half (B) through a second pair of mutually 

centro-symmetrically arranged links, the intermediate 
coupling member (10) being formed of two arcuate 

intermediate member halves (20,22), such that each one 
defines a lateral opening (32) which permits lateral 

removal of the intermediate member half (20,22) from a 
shaft passing centrally through the coupling,
characterized in that
(a) the arcuate intermediate member halves (20,22) of 
the intermediate coupling half (10) 


each extend through more than 180° 
are axially displaced with respect to each 
other, and 
are angularly spaced by 180°, such that the 
opening (32) of each intermediate member half 

(20,22) is aligned with the closed central 
portion (26) of the other intermediate member 

half (22,20), 
(b) each of the intermediate member halves (20,22), in 
the region of its ends (28,30) has a first and a 

second lug (46,52 and 48,54, respectively) side by 
side on both sides of a symmetry plane (50) 

extending between the two intermediate member 
halves (20,22), a first lug thereof (46,52) being 

provided on the side of the opening (32) and the 
second lug (48,54) being provided on the side of 

the closed central portion (26), 
(c) the first lugs (46,52) of one intermediate member 
half (22) being aligned with the second lugs of the 

other intermediate member half (20) and vice versa, 
and 
(d) the links (12,14,16,18) being pivoted on pairs of 
aligned lugs. 
Coupling device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the lugs (46,48) at one end (28) of each 
intermediate coupling half (20,22) are axially offset 

with respect to the lugs (52,54) at the other end (30) 
of the intermediate coupling half (20,22). 
Coupling device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
 a respective pivot bearing (74) for one of the 
links (12,14,16,18) is arranged between each of the 

axially spaced lugs (46,64). 
Coupling device as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the pivot bearings are annular ruber-bonded-metal 
bodies (74), which, at their outer sides, are firmly 

held in eyes (76) of the links (12) and, with their 
inner sides, are firmly held on pivot pins (66) 

extending between the lugs (46,64).
