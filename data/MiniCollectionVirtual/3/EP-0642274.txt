<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for recording and/or reproducing a video 
signal as a moving image or a still image. A moving image may be 

recorded in a first (YCrCb) recording mode wherein a luminance 
signal Y and color difference signals (R-Y) and (R-B) 

corresponding thereto are recorded. A still image may be 
recorded in a second (RGB) recording mode wherein three primary 

color signals corresponding thereto are recorded. In the RGB 
recording mode, the amount of information of each of the three 

primary color signals may be set to at least the amount of 
information of the luminance signal Y of the YCrCb recording mode 

such that, upon the reproduction thereof, a reproduced still 
image having a relatively high resolution is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
recording and/or reproducing a video signal and, more
particularly, to such apparatus for recording and/or reproducing
a still image and a moving image.A conventional analog type video tape recorder (VTR)
integrated camera may include an image pick-up device which
receives an image and forms a luminance signal and a chroma
signal therefrom. Thereafter, the luminance signal is frequency
modulated and the chroma signal is converted to a relatively low
frequency signal, afterwhich the signals are recorded onto a
magnetic tape. Such analog type VTR integrated camera may
produce a picture having relatively poor quality as a result of
signal deterioration due to aging, dubbing operations and the
like.To improve the relatively poor picture quality which
may result from the analog type VTR integrated camera, a digital
type VTR integrated camera having an image pick-up device is
being developed. In such digital type VTR integrated camera, a
video signal from the image pick-up device is digitized and
compressed by a high efficient coding technique and recorded onto
a magnetic tape. The digital type VTR integrated camera produces 
a picture having a relatively good quality which is not
significantly deteriorated over time or due to dubbing
operations, as compared with the analog type VTR integrated
camera previously described.As is to be appreciated, it may be desirable to supply
an output video signal from the digital type VTR integrated
camera to a video printer so as to be printed thereat thereby
forming a photographed picture plane. It may further be desirable
to supply the digital video signal generated by the digital type
VTR integrated camera to a computer so as to enable image
processing to be performed therein with relative ease. It may
still further be desirable to provide a signal representing a
moving image from the digital type VTR integrated camera for
display on a display device. It may still further be desirable
to utilize such digital type VTR integrated camera to provide
other desired features such as printing out of a fetched picture
plane, formation of computer graphics, and the like, which may
not be readily performed by the analog type VTR integrated
camera.However, the above-described digital type
VTR integrated camera normally compresses and records a component
video signal comprising a luminance signal Y and color difference
signals (R-Y) and (B-Y) which may have been band limited. On the
other hand, a video printer and a computer are
