<ABSTRACT>
A cerium and zirconium-containing compound oxide 
contains cerium and zirconium. The zirconium is contained in 

an amount of not less than 1 wt% as a zirconium oxide based on 
a total weight of the compound oxide. The compound oxide has 

an oxygen absorption/desorption capacity of not less than 100 
µmol/g. A method for producing a cerium and 

zirconium-containing compound oxide involves the steps of (a) 
mixing a solution containing cerium ions and zirconium ions 

with an aqueous solution selected from an aqueous solution of 
ammonia, an aqueous solution of ammonium bicarbonate and an 

aqueous solution of oxalic acid to produce a cerium and 
zirconium-containing composite salt precipitate and (b) baking 

the precipitate at a temperature of at least 300° C or higher.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cerium and 
zirconium-containing compound oxide, which may be utilized as 
exhaust gas purification catalysts or ceramics and which 
exhibits a superior oxygen absorption/desorption capacity, and 
a method for producing the compound oxide. Conventionally, cerium oxide has been used in large 
quantities as catalysts for purification of exhaust gases or in 
ceramics. In the field of catalysts, for example, the 
properties of cerium oxide of absorbing oxygen under an 
oxidizing atmosphere and desorbing oxygen under a reducing 
atmosphere are utilized for improving the rate of purification 
for exhaust gases, such as HC, CO or NOx. On the other hand, 
in the field of ceramics, the properties of cerium oxide are 
utilized for electrically conductive ceramics, such as solid 
electrolytes. Such conventional cerium oxide is usually 
prepared by adding oxalic acid or ammonium bicarbonate to a 
cerium nitrate or chlorate solution and filtering, rinsing, 
drying and baking the resulting precipitate. However, conventional cerium oxide prepared by the 
above method exhibits the oxygen absorption/desorption capacity 
which is of an order of 50 µmol/g or less such that it cannot 
absorb or desorb oxygen sufficiently. Besides, a cerium and  
 
zirconium-containing compound oxide having a superior oxygen 
absorption/desorption capacity has not been known to data. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a novel cerium and zirconium-containing compound oxide 
having a superior oxygen absorption/desorption capacity, and a 
method for producing the compound oxide. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a method for producing a cerium and 
zirconium-containing compound oxide having a superior oxygen 
absorption/desorption capacity easily with good 
reproducibility. The above and other objects of the present invention 
will become apparent from the following description. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a cerium and zirconium-containing compound oxide comprising 
cerium and zirconium, the zirconium being contained in an 
amount of not less than 1 wt% as a zirconium oxide based on the 
total weight of the compound oxide, the compound oxide having 
an oxygen absorption/deposition capacity of not less than 100 
µmol/g. According to the present invention, there is also 
provided a method for producing a cerium and 
zirconium-containing compound oxide comprising the steps of: 
(a) mixing a solution containing cerium ions and 
zirconium ions
