<ABSTRACT>
A sight glass for determining the level of liquid (23) 
in a metal bowl (1) of a compressed air filter or 

lubricator comprises a rectangular chamber (19) having 
a rear, brightly coloured wall (5) and a front, 

transparent window (12) formed internally with small 
triangular pyramids (14), the apex of each of which 

faces the rear wall (5). The pyramids (14) 
retro-reflect light when interfaced with air but 

transmit it to the brightly coloured wall (5) from 
which it is reflected back through the window (12) 

when interfaced with liquid (23). An image 
comprising a brightly coloured band and a colourless 

band therefore appears in the window (12), the readily 
visible interface between the bands corresponding to 

the level (24) of the liquid (23) in the bowl(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sight glasses, that 
is to say devices that give a visual indication of the 
liquid level in a vessel. The invention has especial, 
but not exclusive, application to sight glasses for 
use in compressed air filters or lubricators in which 
it is desirable or necessary to have a visual 
indication of the prevailing liquid level in the bowl 
thereof. As is known, a compressed air filter or 
regulator includes a depending bowl which, in the case 
of a filter, collects water and foreign bodies 
filtered out of the compressed air and, in the case of 
a lubricator, contains lubricating oil. The bowl may 
be transparent, in which case the liquid level therein 
is self-evident, or alternatively may be opaque, for 
example made of metal, in which case it is necessary 
or at least desirable to provide a sight glass whereby 
the liquid level may readily be ascertained. Various designs of sight glass have been 
proposed and used in relation to compressed air 
filters and regulators having metal bowls. Almost 
invariably, the sight glass has been in the form of an 
external, vertical glass tube communicating with the 
interior of the bowl whereby the liquid level in the 
tube corresponds with that in the bowl and is 
visible. In the case of colourless liquids, in 
particular, it is however sometimes difficult to 
discern the level. Visibility of the level of 
colourless liquids may be enhanced by, for example, 
placing a pattern on the rear surface of the tube, the 
pattern being such that its appearance below the 
liquid level in the tube (ie as viewed through the  
 
liquid) is markedly different from the appearance 
above it (ie as viewed through air). The provision of tubular sight glasses is, 
however, relatively expensive and it is an object of 
the present invention to provide an alternative form 
of sight glass that is less costly to provide and by 
means of which the level of a liquid, even if 
colourless, may be instantly discerned. According to the present invention, therefore, 
there is provided a sight glass comprising a chamber 
into which liquid whose level is to be determined can 
be admitted, the chamber being defined in part by 
front and rear walls arranged in spaced relationship 
with one another, the front wall being translucent 
and the internal surface thereof comprising a 
plurality of generally pyramidal formations each 
arranged with an apex thereof facing the rear wall so 
that, when interfaced with air, they retro-reflect a 
major proportion of light incident

<CLAIMS>
A sight glass comprising a chamber (19) into 
which liquid (23) whose level (24) is to be determined 

can be admitted, the chamber (19) being defined in 
part by a translucent front wall (12) and a rear wall 

(5) arranged in spaced relationship with one another, 
characterised in that the internal surface of the 

front wall (12) comprises a plurality of generally 
pyramidal formations (14) each arranged with an apex 

(14'') thereof facing the rear wall (5) so that, when 
interfaced with air, they retro-reflect a major 

proportion of light incident thereon back through the 
front wall (12) but that, when interfaced with a 

liquid (23), they transmit a major proportion of such 
light to the rear wall (5) whence it is reflected back 

through the liquid (23) and the front wall (12), the 
internal surface of the rear wall (5) being coloured 

or otherwise ornamented, whereby visibly contrasted 
images between that part of the front wall (12) 

interfaced with air and that part thereof interfaced 
with liquid (23) will be visible through the front 

wall (12). 
A sight glass according to claim 1 wherein 
each of said generally pyramidal formations (14) is a 

cube corner. 
A sight glass according to claim 2 wherein 
said cube corners are arranged in side-by-side 

relationship along the internal surface of said front 
wall (12) with the said apices (14'') lying on one and 

the same line and being equispaced from one another. 
A sight glass according to any one of claims 
1 to 3 wherein the front wall (12) and said generally 

pyramidal formations (14) are moulded integrally with 
one another in transparent plastics material. 
A compressed air filter or lubricator having 
an opaque bowl (1) provided with a sight glass as 

claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 whereby the level 
of liquid (23) contained in the bowl (1) will be 

readily visible.
