<ABSTRACT>
A rotor has a plurality of permanent magnets (2)
embedded in storage pores (3), and is characterised in that

each permanent magnet (2) is inserted in each storage pores
(3) so as to form gaps at both ends of the storage pores

(3) of the field core (1), thereby to form air paths for
cooling air. A mechanism for cooling such a rotor having

permanent magnets (2) is characterised by forming air paths
for cooling air by providing gaps between each of the inner

surfaces of the end plates (4) and the outer surface of the
field core (1), and by forming air paths for cooling air by

providing air paths in the axial direction in contact with
each of the permanent magnets (2) on both ends of the

permanent magnets (2), and locating an inlet (13) and an
outlet (14) for the cooling air in each of said air paths

in such a manner that the cooling air enters one end plate
(4) and exits the other end plate (4) via each of said air

paths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanism for
cooling a rotor having permanent magnets. More particularly,
the invention relates to a mechanism for cooling a rotor having
a plurality of permanent magnets embedded adjacent to a field
core of the rotor for, e.g., a power generator.A rotor has been known, e.g., from Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 8-107639, which comprises providing spaces for
embedding permanent magnets at the position in adjacent to the
outer circumference, laminating field core pieces, and
embedding the permanent magnets. However, such a rotor having
gaps provided cannot sufficiently prevent the leakage of the
magnetic flux of magnetic circuit. Due to the radiation heat
from the armature, which increases the temperatures of the field
core and/or permanent magnets embedded into the field core and
due to insufficient cooling of the permanent magnets,
sufficient output cannot be obtained in the case of the rotor
having a large output. In such a rotor, with the operation of
the power generator, the field core is heated by the radiation
heat from the armature, such an increase in the temperature of
permanent magnets also decrease in output of the power 
generator.In the case of embedding permanent magnets in to field
core in such a conventional rotor, the whole size of rotor
becomes large, the magnet flux is frequently leaked and, thus,
the output of the power generator is decreased. Furthermore,
due to the radiation from the armature, the temperatures of the
field core and the permanent magnet embedded therein are
increased. Due to insufficient cooling of the field core and,
in particular of the permanent magnet, the decrease in the
output due to the heat cannot be avoidedMoreover, such a rotor also is disadvantageous in that
the cooling air within the field core insufficiently flows,
leading to a reduced cooling efficiency and, thus, increase in
the output of the power generator cannot be expected.As shown in Figs. 19A and 19B, we have developed a
lamination of the armature core for a rotating field core type
power generator and filed as Japanese Patent Application No.
9-269046. The lamination construction of an armature sheets
according to this application is a lamination (D1-Dn) of the
armature sheets G in which the armature core sheets has a
circular shape in order to store a field core of the power
generator within the armature, which can revolves within the
armature core, each armature is formed by punching plurality
of V-shaped or trapezoid caulking portions K on the outer
circumfere

A mechanism for cooling a rotor having permanent

storage pores (3) of a field core (1) formed by laminating
a plurality of field core sheets (1') having storage pores

said storage pores (3) so as to form gaps at both ends of

the storage pores (3) of the field core (1), thereby to
form air paths for cooling air, the field core (1) of the

rotor being fixed between a pair of end plates (4), the

end plate (4) and exits the other end plate (4) via each of

the said air paths, and wherein
concave grooves (6) each having an air inlet in
which an outer frame side is closed and an axis core side

is opened, and concave portions (7) each having an air 
outlet in which an axis core side is closed and an outer

frame side is opened are alternately placed on the inner

portion (7) on one end plate (4) is positioned opposite to
a concave groove (6) on the other end plate (4) so as to

clamp the said field core (1) and, at the same time, the
air paths formed at both ends of the permanent magnets (2)

perforated into the field core (1) are fixed by said pair
of end plates (4) on both sides of the field core (1)

opposite to the concave portion (7) and the concave groove
(6) of the said pair of end plates (4), and
according to the rotation of the rotor, by means of
a fan effect caused by an outside wing, and by means of

projected portions around said concave grooves (6) and
projected portions around said concave portions (7)

extending radially of the rotor, the cooling air is spouted
through the gaps formed between the inner surface of the

end plate (4) and the outer surface of the field core (1)

said concave groove (6), then it passes through the air
paths, and is spouted at the concave portion (7) opposite
