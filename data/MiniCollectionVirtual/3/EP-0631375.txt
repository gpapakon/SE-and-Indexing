<ABSTRACT>
The contrasting requirements of low power 
consumption during operation and ability to function 

under drastic drops of the supply voltage at start-up 
of output power stages of an electric system of self-generation 

and recharge of a storage battery, are 
satisfied by an output power driving stage composed of 

a bipolar transistor and a field effect transistor, 
functionally connected in parallel to each other and 

having independent control terminals. A control signal 
is selectably switched either to the base of the 

bipolar output transistor or to the gate of the field 
effect output transistor, depending on the level of the 

supply voltage. A comparator comparing the voltage 
present on the supply node with a reference voltage 

controls a selection switch. The low threshold of the 
bipolar transistor ensures functioning at start-up, 

while the field effect transistor provides a low power 
consumption during normal running conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an output stage, 
the type of which is automatically selected depending 
on the supply voltage. Either a bipolar junction 
transistor or a field effect transistor is selected, 
depending upon the supply voltage level. The output stage 
is particularly, though nonexclusively useful for 
implementing a regulator for an alternator of an 
electric system of self-generation and recharge of a 
storage battery. An output stage, comprising a power transistor 
capable of driving a load, typically an external load 
that is connected to a first supply node, by 
functionally connecting it to a second supply node, 
represents the output circuit for implementing a 
certain function (regulation, control, actuation, 
charge, display, ...) in a vast number of applications. Commonly, the stage may be configured as a so-called 
"low-side driver", usually employing a bipolar NPN 
transistor or an n-channel MOS transistor, or as a so-called 
"high-side driver", usually employing a PNP 
bipolar transistor or a p-channel MOS transistor. Stringent requirements to limit power dissipation 
through the power transistor that drives the external 
load determine ever more often the choice of a field 
effect transistor (typically a MOS transistor), which 
is intrinsically capable of reducing power dissipation 
by about an order of magnitude as compared with a 
bipolar junction transistor of similar current-carrying 
capacity. On the other hand, a power MOS transistor 
hardly has a turn-on, threshold voltage below about 
0.8-1V and, typically, in the case of a transistor designed  
 
for relatively high power, the threshold voltage 
may raise to a value comprised between 3V and 6V. However, there are many applications, especially in 
electric self-generation systems, wherein, during certain 
operating phases, for example at the start-up of 
the system, the supply voltage may be subject to a 
large drop. This may occur for example because of momentaneous, 
large current absorption peaks of certain 
loads, for example an electric starter of a thermal engine, 
and similar. In other situations, as for example 
in the case of an electric equipment of a vehicle, certain 
specific requisites, such as the need of regulating 
the voltage powering the electric circuit of the 
vehicle, as produced by the alternator, already at a 
very low number of RPM of the thermal engine driving 
the alternator, may not be compatible with the relatively 
high threshold voltage of an output power MOS transistor. 
For example,
