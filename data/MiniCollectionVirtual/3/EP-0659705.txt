<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sintered ceramic article 
formed mainly of alumina and has particular reference to 
a sintered ceramic which is characterized by exhibiting 
high toughness at normal room temperature and at elevated 
temperatures (1200°C). This invention also includes a 
method for the production of the sintered ceramic article. Alumina has a high melting point, is thermally 
stabile, and excels in resistance to abrasion, insulation 
property, and resistance to corrosion and, on account of 
these features, has found extensive utility as an 
industrial material. For example, the high electric 
insulating property of alumina is utilized in electronic 
components such as spark plugs, IC substrates, and 
packages as well as in light-pervious alumina, bioceram 
and other such highly functional sintered articles and 
single-crystal materials. Practical application of 
alumina as a functional material has thus been extended 
into a wide range of fields. Application of alumina as a 
structural material, however, has been slower. This can 
be traced to the low toughness of alumina, which is in the 
range of 3 to 4 MPam1/2. In terms of resistance to 
oxidation and corrosion, however, alumina is fundamentally 
superior to such non-oxide ceramic materials as silicon 
nitride and silicon carbide which are the main ceramic 
structural materials in use today. It is therefore 
regarded as a potentially excellent structural material. 
Moreover, alumina can be fired in the open air, whereas  
 
the non-oxide ceramic materials are required to be fired 
nitrogen, argon or other such non-oxidizing gas 
atmosphere. A plant for the production of sintered 
alumina articles is therefore not very expensive to 
construct. Further, it can be operated at a low running 
cost. Various methods have been studied for improving 
the toughness of alumina. These methods can be roughly 
divided into the four types: (1) dispersion of ZrO2, (2) 
dispersion of platelike particles or whiskers, (3) growth 
of platelike alumina particles by the addition of a liquid 
phase forming auxiliary, and (4) the growth of platelike 
particles as La2O3·11Al2O3 (hereinafter referred to 
briefly as "LaAl11O18") in a coexistent relationship with 
alumina. The method of (1) consists in utilizing the 
stress-induced modification of zirconia. It is reported 
that the alumina produced by this method possesses a high 
fracture toughness in the range of from 5 to 8 MPam1/2. 
Since the mechanism for increasing toughness utilizes the 
phase modification of
