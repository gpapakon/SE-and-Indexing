<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
mounting a semiconductor device on a circuit board, and
also relates to the circuit board with the semiconductor
device mounted thereon. More particularly, the
invention relates to a method for mounting a semiconductor
device facedown on a circuit board by the use of
a conductive adhesive, and also relates to the circuit
board on which the semiconductor device is mounted by
using this method.Previously, soldering technology has often
been used to mount a semiconductor device on a circuit
board. In recent years, the package of a semiconductor
device has become smaller in size and the number of the
pins thereof has increased, so that the pin pitch has
been greatly reduced. It is difficult to mount a semiconductor
device with such a reduced pin pitch on a
circuit board by using the conventional soldering
technology. In the present specification, a circuit
board can include a chip carrier or the like.Thus, there has recently been developed a
method in which a semiconductor device without a package,
a so called bare chip, is directly mounted on a
circuit board, thereby reducing the mounting area and
increasing the board density. An example of such a
method is as follows: First, an electrode composed of a
solder layer is formed on each terminal electrode of
the semiconductor device. Then, the semiconductor 
device is placed facedown on a circuit board so that
the thus formed electrode comes into contact with a
corresponding connecting electrode of the circuit
board. Thereafter, the solder is heated to melt,
thereby bonding the semiconductor device to the circuit
board. This mounting method is advantageous in that
all the terminal electrodes of the semiconductor device
can be simultaneously connected to the circuit board.It is known from WO-A-8803704 a method to attach a
semiconductor die to a circuit board by means of a
thermoplastic conductive adhesive. A conventional encapsulating
step follows to obtain a substrate with a semiconductor die
mounted thereon comprising a joining layer formed of a
thermoplastic conductive adhesive, the die being encapsulated
by epoxy.It is known from JP-A-5218137 a method to bond a
semiconductor element to a circuit board by means of a
thermoplastic resin, and to fix the element to the board by
curing a thermosetting resin covering the thermoplastic resin
at a temperature lower than the plasticizing temperature of the
thermoplastic resin.It is known from EP-A-332402 a method of manufacturing a
connection construction for connecting
