<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a class of
substituted imidazole, triazole and tetrazole derivatives
which act on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors, being
selective agonists of so-called "5-HT1-like" receptors.
They are therefore useful in the treatment of clinical
conditions for which a selective agonist of these
receptors is indicated.5-HT1-like receptor agonists which exhibit
selective vasoconstrictor activity have recently been
described as being of use in the treatment of migraine
(see, for example, A. Doenicke et al., The Lancet, 1988,
Vol. 1, 1309-11). The compounds of the present
invention, being selective 5-HT1-like receptor agonists,
are accordingly of particular use in the treatment of
migraine and associated conditions, e.g. cluster
headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, headache
associated with vascular disorders, tension headache and
paediatric migraine.EP-A-0313397 and WO-A-91/18897 describe
separate classes of tryptamine derivatives substituted by
various five-membered heteroaliphatic rings, which are
stated to be specific to a particular type of "5-HT1-like"
receptor and thus to be effective therapeutic
agents for the treatment of clinical conditions,
particularly migraine, requiring this activity. However,
neither EP-A-0313397 nor WO-A-91/18897 discloses or
suggests the imidazole, triazole and tetrazole
derivatives provided by the present invention.EP-A-0497512, published on 5th August 1992,
describes a class of substituted imidazole, triazole and
tetrazole derivatives which are stated to be selective
agonists of 5-HT1-like receptors and hence to be of 
particular use in the treatment of migraine and associated
conditions.The present invention provides a compound of formula I, or a
salt thereof:

wherein the broken circle represents two non-adjacent double bonds in
any position in the five-membered ring;
two, three or four of V, W, X, Y and Z represent nitrogen and
the remainder represent carbon provided that, when two of V, W, X, Y
and Z represent nitrogen and the remainder represent carbon, then the
said nitrogen atoms are in non-adjacent positions within the five-membered
ring;A1 represents hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or amino;A2 represents a non-bonded electron pair when four of V, W, X,
Y and Z represent nitrogen and the other represents carbon; or, when
two or three of V, W, X, Y and Z represent nitrogen and the remainder
represent carbon, A2 represents hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or amino;E represents a bond or a straight or branched alkylene chain
containing from 1 to 4 carbon
