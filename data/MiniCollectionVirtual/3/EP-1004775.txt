<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a
turbomolecular pump capable of maintaining a maximum discharge

rate even in a higher pressure. Blades (63) of a rotor blade
(62) and blades (75) of a stator blade (72) at each stage are

respectively shaped so that the performance in a range from
the elevation angle emphasizing the amount of sucking gas to

the elevation angle emphasizing the capability of preventing
the reverse flow can be exerted in the blades at one stage.

More specifically, the elevation angle of α1 on the inlet port
side on blade surfaces (C, D) facing the outlet port is set to

a range between 20 and 50 degrees. Assuming the elevation
angle α1 = L on the inlet port side, while the elevation angle

of α2 on the outlet port side is set to a range between 10 and
(L - 5) degrees. It is so constructed that both effect to

secure the amount of sucking gas and to prevent the reverse
flow at their own stage can be realized in the blades at each

stage, whereby a maximum discharge rate can be maintained even
in a higher pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a turbomolecular pump
and a turbomolecular pump apparatus, and more specifically to
a turbomolecular pump and a turbomolecular pump apparatus,
which are used as a vacuum apparatus in semiconductor
manufacturing eqipment, an electron microscope or the like.In a case where dry etching, CVD, etc. are performed upon
manufacturing a semiconductor or liquid crystal, a
turbomolecular pump apparatus is employed to suck and/or
discharge a process gas, which is supplied into a chamber, by
means of a turbomolecular pump.The turbomolecular pump has stator blades and rotor
blades which are alternately disposed to provide pairs of the
rotor blades and the stator blades in multistage arrangement.
The rotor blades are disposed on a rotor axis that is rotated
at high speed, and the stator blades are fixed to a casing.The rotor blade at each stage includes blades (vanes)
provided radially with the inlet port side being tilted toward
a traveling direction (direction of rotation). The stator
blade at each stage includes blades (vane) provided radially 
which are tilted in an opposite direction to the blades of the
rotor blade.The rotor blades imparts momentum to gas molecules for
delivering them toward the outlet port, and the gas molecules
thus transferred are obliquely reflected by the tilted
surfaces of the blades of the stator blade, thereby gradually
being transferred to the subsequent stage. In such a manner,
the gas molecules are sequentially fed from the inlet port
side to the outlet port side by the rotor and stator blades at
the respective stages, to thereby carry out the discharge.Fig. 10 is a view showing a sectional configuration of
the blades of rotor blades and stator blades in such a gas
molecular area.As shown in Fig. 10, blades la of the rotor blade and
blades 2a of the stator blade on the inlet port side are
respectively formed to have an angle (elevation angles) A of
from 30 degrees to 50 degrees with respect to the traveling
direction in order to take in the more gas molecules to
thereby increase a suction amount thereof.On the other hand, an elevation angle B of each blade at
the outlet port side is set to 25 degree or lower so that it
is possible to prevent the gas from reverse-flowing even if
the gas pressure rises and mean free distance becomes short.In other words, the blades 1a, 2a at the inlet port side 
have a larger tilt angle, while the blades 1b, 2b at the
outlet port side have a smaller tilt angle.In addition, as shown in Fig. 10, the blades at any
stage are
