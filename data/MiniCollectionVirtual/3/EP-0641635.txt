<CLAIMS>
A process for producing foam boards having a dynamic rigidity 
of not greater than 10 MN/m
3
 by aftertreating customary and 
known foam boards by compression, which comprises compressing 

polystyrene particle foam boards having a density of from 17 
to 30 kg/m
3
 to a maximum extent of from 60 to 90% of their 
original thickness, releasing the compression, and repeating 

this operation at least once. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the aftertreated foam 
boards have a thickness of from 30 to 120 mm. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the foam boards 
are compressed to a maximum extent of from 70 to 85% of their 

original thickness. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the foam 
boards are compressed by moving two plane-parallel plates 

toward each other at a constant compression rate of from 1 to 
300 cm/min.
