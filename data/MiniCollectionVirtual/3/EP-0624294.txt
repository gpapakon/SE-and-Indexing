A process for the recovery, at the receiving end, 
of data items (block 47) transmitted across a 

transmission link (49) for digital data streams from the 
transmitting end to the receiving end 


wherein the different data items (block 47) are 
coded at the transmitting end of the transmission 

link (49) by means of a binary code word which is 
generated by a code word generator (20) and which, 

auto-correlated, results in a Dirac pulse, and by 
means of further binary code words generated by the 

code word generator (20) by cyclic shifting of its 
one code word and inverse code words obtained 

therefrom by inversion and 
wherein at the receiving end of the transmission 
link (49) for the purpose of decoding a cross-correlation 

of the respective received code word 
(block 50) is carried out by a cross-correlator 

(51) with analysis of the relative position and 
sign of the main maximum of the respective cross-correlation 

function for the recovery of the data 
items, 
 
characterised in that 


at the transmitting end a further code word supply 
is used, of which the one code word, generated by a 

further code word generator, auto-correlated 
results in a Dirac pulse, and of which the further 

binary code words are generated by cyclic shifting 
of the one code word and of which the inverse code 

words are generated by inversion,
 
   - where the further code word generator can be 

described by a generator polynomial (G₂(x)) of 
the same degree as the first code word 

generator (20), 
a number of data items (D(x)) with data polynomials 
of the seventh degree are coded in that data  

 
polynomials (D
k
(x)) formed therefrom in each case 
comprising the five lowest binary digit positions 

of the data polynomial (D(x)) of the seventh degree 
are assigned the code words (G₁(x) non-inverted; 

G₂(x) non-inverted) of the two code words 
generators in dependence upon two value 

combinations of the two highest binary digit 
positions (d₆, d₇) of the data polynomial (D(x)) of 

the seventh degree, 
a further number of the data items (D(x)) with data 
polynomials of the seventh degree are coded in that 

data polynomials (D(x)) formed therefrom in each 
case comprising the five lowest binary digit 

positions of the data polynomial of the seventh 
degree are assigned the inverse code words (G₁(x) 

inverted; G₂(x) inverted) of the two code word 
generators in dependence upon two further value 

combinations of the two highest binary digit 
positions (d₆, d₇) of the data polynomial (D(x)) of 

the seventh degree and 
an additional number of the data items (D(x)) with 
data polynomials of the seventh degree are coded in 

that data polynomials formed therefrom in each case 
with zero at the five lowest binary digit positions 

(d₁ - d₅) of the data polynomial (D(x)) of the 
seventh degree are assigned code words (G₃(x); 

a,b,c,d) of an additional code word supply in 
dependence upon four value combinations of the two 

highest binary digit positions (d₆, d₇) of the data 
polynomial (D(x)) of the seventh degree,
 
   - where the additional code word supply is 

generated by means of an additional code word 
generator which is identical to the two other 

code word generators in respect of the degree 
of its generator polynomial (G₃(x)) and its 

code words,  
 
at the receiving end by means of a further and an 
additional cross-correlator (52, 53) in each case 

with different correlation references (M₂(x), M₃(x) 
three cross-correlation functions are formed and 

are investigated in respect of the value of the 
amounts of their main maxima and 
in the case of a value of the amount of a main 
maximum lying above a given value, its relative 

position is determined and from this, taking into 
account the sign of the respective main maximum, 

the respective transmitted data item is obtained. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that
 
   - for the coding of the additional number of data 

items (D(x)) in addition to the code words (G₃(x); 
a,c) of the additional code word supply, code words 

(G₃(x); b,d) formed by the inversion of the latter 
are used. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that
 
   - the value of the main maxima of the cross-correlation 

functions (KKF(n) is analyzed as a 
gauge of the number of bit errors.
