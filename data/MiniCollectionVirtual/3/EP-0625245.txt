<CLAIMS>
Assembly for conveying a liquid medium, especially 
a heat carrier, in the cooling and heating circuit 

(9) of a motor vehicle, with an electric drive motor 
(37), having a commutator (52) and wiper brushes (54) 

applied to the running surface of the latter, for a feed 
pump (34) which is connected into the circuit and of 

which the feed member (74) is connected fixedly in terms 
of rotation to one coupling half (70) and the motor 

armature (38) to the other coupling half (66) of a 
magnetic coupling (68), and a preferably multi-part 

assembly housing (40, 42, 44) surrounds a space (46), 
receiving the motor (37), and a chamber (76) having a 

feed member (74) of the pump (34), characterized in that 
a moisture-permeable wall (86) with separates the pumping 

chamber (76) from the motor space (46) is arranged 
between the two coupling halves (66, 70). 
Assembly according to Claim 1, in which the 
armature of the drive motor is mounted in a flange-like 

housing wall arranged between the laminated armature core 
and the magnetic coupling, characterized in that this 

intermediate housing wall (40) has at least one perforation 
(96) which connects the motor space (46) to an 

intermediate chamber (94) receiving the motor-side 
coupling half (66). 
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a plurality of perforations (96) are arranged in the 

intermediate housing wall (40). 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the moisture-permeable wall (86)  

 
consists of a plastic.
