<ABSTRACT>
According to this method, probe signals (S) of an electromagnetic nature are injected into a radiating cable (4) so as to irradiate an active responder carried by a mobile unit to be located (M). The response signals (RA) emitted by this responder and transmitted by this cable are detected. At least two times are measured, each separating the instant of departure of a probe signal from the instant of arrival of a corresponding response signal, and not only is an abscissa of the mobile unit measured along this cable deduced therefrom, but also a distance from this mobile unit to this cable. This invention applies advantageously to locating a mobile unit in an elongate confined space such as a mine gallery.

A location method in which:

a moving body to be located (M) is provided with an active
responder (L) capable of responding to an electromagnetic-type probe

signal by transmitting a corresponding electromagnetic-type response
signal;
said probe signals (S) are injected into a radiating cable (4)
that has a coverage zone (Z) in which said moving body to be located

(M) may be located, each such probe signal being injected at a
starting instant and at a starting point;
said response signals (RA) are detected at the output of said
cable, each such response signal being detected at an ending instant

and at an ending point; and
signal propagation times are measured, each such propagation
time being measured from the starting instant of one of said probe

signals to the ending instant of a corresponding response signal; and
an abscissa value (X) of a position of said moving body is
deduced from said propagation times, the abscissa value being

measured along said cable from an origin defined relative to said
starting point and to said ending point;

said method being characterized by the fact that at least two
of said propagation times are measured, which times are chosen so as

to be different from each other for the same position of said moving
body, and not only is one of said abscissa values deduced from the

times, but also a transverse distance (Y) from the position to the
cable is deduced therefrom.
A method according to claim 1, in which said cable has a first end
constituting said starting point of one of said probe signals, the

first end and a second end of the cable constituting respective ones
of said ending points for two of said response signals correspondi
ng
to the probe signal, said abscissa value and said transverse distance

being deduced from the respective propagation times that are measured
to the respective ending instants of the two response signals.
A method according to claim 1, in which said cable has a first end
and a second end respectively constituting a first one of said 

starting points of a first one of said probe signals, and a second
one of said starting points of a second one of said probe signals,

the first end and the second end also respectively constituting a
first one of said ending points for a first one of said response

signals corresponding to said first probe signal, and a second one of
said ending points for a second one of said response signals

corresponding to said second probe signal, said abscissa value and
said transverse distance being deduced from the two propagation times

that are measured to the respective ending instants of the two
response signals.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that it is implemented automatically.
