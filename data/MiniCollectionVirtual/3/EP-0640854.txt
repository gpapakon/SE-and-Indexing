<ABSTRACT>
An optical input section for a coherent optical receiver based on
polarisation diversity include means for a different order mode conversion

(25.2 in 41) followed means for different order mode splitting (25.3 in 41)
before or after means for mixing (42, 43) of optical signals. Since devices for

different order mode splitting and for mixing have simple integrable
realizations without metallized elements, t.w. (a)symmetric Y-junctions and

3dB-power couplers, respectively, the optical input section is realizable
without such metallized elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of the conversion of guided modes of light
waves in integrated optical components. More particularly, the invention
relates to an optical input section for a coherent optical receiver based on
polarisation diversity. The present application is a division application of the
European Patent application No. 92201338.8.In a coherent optical receiver such as can be used in a coherent optical
network, a laser is usually incorporated as local oscillator. The light from said
laser is mixed with an optical signal received from such a network by the
receiver. Since the light transmission through the network is generally not
polarization-preserving, the polarization of the optical signal received is
undefined. The optical signal received is therefore first split into two
polarization components TE and TM, which are then processed separately.
This is done by mixing with the light of the local oscillator either directly
before or directly after splitting. This technique is known by the term
polarization diversity'. This means, however, that the light of the local
oscillator must also contain both polarization components in order to have
mixing components which correspond in polarization with the two polarization
components of the optical signal received. A laser which is standard in this
connection and has a wavelength of the emitted light in the near infrared
transmits, however, only TE-polarized light. To obtain the other polarization
component consideration could be given to tilting the laser through a suitable 
angle. However, in an integrated design of the coherent optical receiver, in
which the laser is co-integrated, tilting the laser is troublesome, if not
impracticable. It is therefore first necessary to convert a portion of said TE-polarized
light into TM-polarized light with the aid of a polarization converter
or rotator. A polarization converter is understood as meaning a device with
which a known portion of one polarization component, TE or TM, in the
optical signal at the input of said device is converted into the other
polarization component TM or TE respectively, at the output, with a well-defined
phase with respect to the one polarization component. A polarization
rotator is such a type of device in which, however, a phase shift is
uncontrolled. Such TE/TM polarization converters and rotators are known per
se, for example from references [1], [2] and [3] (see under D.). Reference [1]
discloses a polarization converter for optical waves which is able to convert
any input
