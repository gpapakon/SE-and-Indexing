<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for making at least one MOS transistor on a
silicon substrate (30). According to this method, a layer of silicon dioxide material (10,20)

is formed on a principal surface of the substrate (30). The oxide layer is then patterned
such that at least one source region and at least one drain region (70) of the substrate

are exposed. A layer (50) of boron-doped germanium is then deposited on the
exposed regions by RTCVD. The substrate is then heated such that boron diffuses

from the germanium layer (50) into the source and drain regions (70). The substrate principal
surface can then be etched such that the germanium layer (50) is removed with high

selectivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the fabrication of MOS integrated circuits in 
which boron is used as a dopant. More particularly, the invention relates to 
the formation of ultra-shallow p⁺ -n junctions in MOS devices having very small 
channel lengths. Designers of MOS integrated circuits are turning increasingly toward 
active devices having channel lengths that are a small fraction of 1 µm. However, 
these efforts to miniaturize are complicated by the emergence of undesirable, short-channel 
effects. One method for avoiding at least some of these effects is to 
fabricate devices having ultrashallow source and drain junctions; i.e., junctions that 
are made as shallow as possible without unacceptably increasing the sheet 
resistances of the corresponding doped silicon regions. It has proven relatively 
simple to form n⁺ -p junctions (i.e., junctions between n⁺ source or drain regions 
and a p-type substrate portion) that are ultrashallow, because suitable n-type dopants 
are available. For example, arsenic can be implanted without undesirable channeling 
effects, and it has a high solid solubility in silicon. However, most of the available p-type dopants do not have sufficient 
solid solubility in silicon for making p⁺ -n junctions. Boron is generally the only 
practical choice for this purpose. However, it is difficult to make shaliow junctions 
by ion implantation of boron, because boron exhibits channeling behavior. Extremely shallow, boron-doped p⁺ -n junctions (hereafter referred to 
as "boron junctions") have, in fact, been made by low energy ion implantation 
followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA). However, the resulting junctions 
exhibited relatively high sheet resistance, and the control of the junction depth was 
complicated by channeling effects (during implantation) and transient diffusion 
(during annealing). Some practitioners have sought to overcome the deficiencies of this 
approach by using a boron-doped, deposited layer as a diffusion source. In one such 
approach, a layer of silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloy is deposited by rapid thermal 
chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) on a silicon substrate. Boron is implanted into 
the SiGe layer. The desired junctions are then formed by rapid thermal annealing.  
 
This approach is described, for example, in D.T. Grider et al., "Ultra-Shallow 
Junction Formation by Diffusion from Polycrystalline SixGe1-x Alloys," 1991 
Electron.Mater.Conf., Boulder, Colorado. Because the diffusion source is created 
in two separate steps, this approach adds an
