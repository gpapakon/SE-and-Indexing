<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel vaccine formulations, methods for preparing them and to their use in therapy.
In particular the present invention relates to novel formulations for treating Hepatitis B infections and to combination vaccine
formulations including a Hepatitis B vaccine component.Viral hepatitis, caused by the A, B, C, D, and E hepatitis viruses, is a very common viral illness. Via the 3 and C
viruses, in particular, it is also responsible for many cases of liver cancer. Thus the development of effective vaccines is
critical and, despite notable successes. is still an on-going task. A review on modern hepatitis vaccines, including a
number of key references, may be found in the Lancet. May 12th 1990 at page 1142 ff (Prof A.L.W.F. Eddleston). See
also 'Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease' (Vyas, B.N., Dienstag, J.L., and Hoofnagle, J.H., eds, Grune and Stratton, Inc.
(1984) and 'Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease' (Proceedings of the 1990) International Symposium, eds F.B. Hollinger,
S.M. Lemon and H. Margolis, published by Williams and Wilkins).Infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a widespread problem but vaccines which can be used for mass immunisation
are available, for example the product 'Havrix' (SmithKline Beecham Biologicals) which is a killed attenuated vaccine
obtained from the HM-175 strain of HAV [see 'Inactivated Candidate Vaccines for Hepatitis A' by F.E. Andre, A
Hepburn and E.D'Hondt, Prog Med. Virol. Vol 37, pages 72-95 (1990) and the product monograph 'Havrix' published
by SmithKline Beecham Biologicals (1991)].Flehmig et al (loc cit., pages 56-71) have reviewed the clinical aspects, virology, immunology and epidemiology of
Hepatitis A and discussed approaches to the development of vaccines against this common viral infection.In the present invention the hepatitis A antigen may comprise live attenuated virus
particles or inactivated attenuated virus particles.Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a widespread problem but vaccines which can be used for mass immunisation
are now available, for example the product Engerix® -B' (SmithKline Beecham plc) which a obtained by genetic
engineering techniques.The preparation of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is well documented. See. for example, Harford et al in
Develop. Biol. Standard 54, page 125(1983), Gregg et al in Biotechnology, 5, page 479(1987), EP-A-0 226 846, EP-A-0
299 108 and references therein.As used herein the expression 'Hepatitis B surface antigen' or 'HBsAg' includes any HBsAg antigen or fragment
the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vaccine composition comprising an antigen selected from:

a hepatitis B surface antigen wherein the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is not part
of an immunogenic hybrid polypeptide;
in conjunction with 3-0-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A and an aluminium salt.
A vaccine composition as claimed in Claim 1 in which the aluminium salt is
aluminium hydroxide.
A vaccine composition as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 which additionally
comprises a hepatitis A antigen comprising live attenuated virus particles or inactivated

attenuated virus particles
A vaccine composition as claimed in claim 3 wherein the Hepatitis A antigen is
an inactivated whole cell composition derived from the HM-175 strain.
A vaccine composition as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the HBsAg
comprises the 226 amino acid S antigen of HBsAg.
A vaccine composition as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the HBsAg additionally
comprises a pre-S sequence.
A vaccine composition as claimed in Claim 6 in which the HBsAg comprises a
composite particle of the formula (L*,S) wherein L* denotes a modified L protein

of hepatitis B virus having an amino acid sequence comprising residues 12-52
followed by residues 133-145 followed by residues 175-400 of the L protein and

S denotes the S-protein of HBsAg.
A vaccine composition as claimed in any preceding claim admixed with at least
one other component selected from a non-hepatitis antigen which affords

protection against one or more of the following: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,
Haemophilus influenza b (Hib), and polio.
A vaccine composition according to Claim 8 selected from a DTP (diphtheriatetanus-pertussis)
HBsAg combination, a Hib-HBsAg combination, a DTP-Hib-HBsAg

combination and an IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) -DTP-Hib-HBsAg
combination.
A vaccine composition as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the 3-O-deacylated
monophosphoryl lipid A is present in the range 10µg-100µg per dose.
A vaccine composition as claimed in any preceding claim for use as a
medicament. 
Use of a composition as defined in any one of claims 1 to 10 in the manufacture
of a medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of hepatitis B infections.
