<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a plate (1a) which includes, in its upper part, two parallel and cylindrical barrels (1c and 1d) which are offset, on the one hand, by an angle ( alpha ) with respect to the vertical plane passing through the middle of the plate (1a) and, on the other hand, by an angle ( beta ) with respect to the horizontal axis passing through the middle of the said plate.

<CLAIMS>
Device for joining together fractures of the upper
end of the femur, comprising a plate which is screwed into

the femur and having a sliding barrel into which a
tensioning screw is introduced, characterised in that in

its upper part the plate (1
a
) has two parallel,
cylindrical barrels (1
c
 and 1
d
) which are offset, on the
one hand towards the front by an angle α with respect to

the vertical plane which passes through the middle of the
plate (1
a
), and on the other hand towards the top by an
angle β with respect to a horizontal axis which passes

through the middle of said plate.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the barrels (1
c
 and 1
d
) are offset laterally with respect
to one another by a distance (X) so as to perfectly match

the morphology of the femur (2).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the upper part of the plate (1
a
) is configured as an arc
of a circle in a manner whereby it moulds itself to the

external curvature of the femur (2).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the barrels (1
c
 and 1
d
) have smooth internal bores to
permit the sliding of anchoring screws (3) which are

placed in traction with the help of screws (3
e
) in order
to plate the cephalic ball (2
a
) onto the femur (2).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that a
trochanteric element (4) is associated with the device (1)

by way of a complementary joining together in the event of
fracture of the trochanteric body.
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that in
its upper part the element (4) presents a hook-shaped 

profile in the shape of a single or double hook (4
a
),
beneath which there is provided a support surface (4
b
)
which continues as two parallel arms (4
c
) which are joined
at their free ends by a plate (4
d
).
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that
the support face (4
b
) has holes (4
f
) for fixing the
element (4) into the upper part of the femur (2).
