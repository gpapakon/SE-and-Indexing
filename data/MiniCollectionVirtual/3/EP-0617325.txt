<ABSTRACT>
An improved image forming method is disclosed 
which comprises contacting both an originating 

photographic element and a display photographic element 
with substantially similar processing solutions. The 

originating photographic element is characterized in 
that it contains light sensitive 〈100〉-faced silver 

chloride tabular shaped emulsions showing an aspect 
ratio greater than 2:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved
processing method for developing and/or desilvering
originating photographic elements and display
photographic elements.The basic image-forming process of color
photography comprises exposing a silver halide
photographic recording material to light, and
chemically processing the material to reveal a useable
image. The fundamental steps of this processing
typically entail: (1) treating the exposed silver
halide with a color developer wherein some or all of
the silver halide is reduced to metallic silver while
an organic dye is formed from the oxidized color
developer; and (2) removing the silver metal thus
formed and any residual silver halide by the
desilvering steps of bleaching, wherein the developed
silver is oxidized to silver salts, and fixing, wherein
the silver salts are dissolved and removed from the
photographic material. The bleaching and fixing steps
may be performed sequentially or as a single step,
which is discussed herein as blixing. In some methods
of color image formation, additional color or black &
white development steps, chemical fogging steps and
ancillary stopping, washing, accelerating and
stabilizing steps may be employed.In many situations, the useable image is
provided to a customer by a multi-stage method which
involves exposing a light sensitive originating element
to a scene, and developing and desilvering that
originating element to form a color image. The 
originating element may, for example, be a color
negative film or a motion picture negative film. The
resultant color image is then used to modulate the
exposure of a light sensitive display element, with
optional enlargement, in a printer. The display
element may, for example, be a color paper, an
intermediate film, or a motion picture projection film.
The exposed display element is then developed and
desilvered to form a useful color image which
duplicates the original scene.Originating elements are typically designed
to allow good exposure with available light under a
wide variety of lighting conditions, that is, good
sensitivity (speed/grain) and dynamic range (long
latitude and low gamma) are desired. Conversely,
display elements are typically designed so as to allow
a full range of density formation after well defined
exposure and process conditions in a printer, that is,
good image discrimination (high density and low fog),
low dynamic range (short latitude and high gamma) and
easy and consistent processing are desired. These
greatly different needs are typically met by
