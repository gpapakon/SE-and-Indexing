<ABSTRACT>
A movement sensor (40) for a process device has a sensor tip (42); means (41) for transmitting the vibrations from the sensor tip to a transducer means (43), the transducer means electrically detecting the resulting vibrations as movement occurs and producing an output signal. Means (70) can be provided for filtering the output signal below and above respective predetermined frequencies and producing a movement detection signal when the output signal lies between the predetermined frequencies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of detecting the 
movement of an active device relative to a surface, in 
order to control the operation of the device to process the 
surface in some way. A particular field of application is 
for controlling a range of hand held devices used for 
writing, scanning, coating, spraying, heating, etc.. There are many applications where it is necessary to 
bring some device up to a surface, which cannot be prepared 
in any way beforehand, and to move the device over the 
surface whilst treating or sensing the surface in some way. 
Examples are: 
writing or printing on the surface by depositing 
ink spraying some material onto the surface using an optical sensor to read existing marks 
on the surface, such as bar codes or letters heating the surface with a focused beam of 
infra-red radiation writing or reading a magnetic pattern with an 
electromagnetic head. A particular example is in the context of hand held 
printers. In the general applications it is necessary to 
generate a signal to control the process to treat the 
desired region of the surface in the correct way. The basic control function that is required is to turn 
the process on when the device is moving across the 
surface, and in contact with it. In some cases, as in a 
writing instrument, it may be necessary to signal that 
contact has been made, even if there is no transverse 
movement. In the prior art various techniques have been used to 
generate the control signal. The simplest approach in a 
hand-held device is to provide a finger operated switch, as 
in the ink jet pen described in US-A-4 746 936. The user  
 
has to decide exactly when to turn the device on and off. 
In practice this is inconvenient to use, and does not 
provide accurate enough control. Many existing devices, e.g. as described in 
US-A-4 168 533 have a wheel or belt which is moved by 
friction as the device travels across the surface. The 
movement of the wheel or belt is then detected by some 
additional sensor system. This approach can provide good 
results in many applications, but has a number of 
disadvantages: 
the low reliability of a moving parts mechanism high component and assembly costs large size and inconvenient shape single direction operation. The object of the current invention is to provide a 
sensor which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art 
to offer the following: 
solid state operation, and reliability small size low cost omni-directional operation convenient shapes and formats. The present invention
