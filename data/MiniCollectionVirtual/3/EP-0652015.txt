<ABSTRACT>
Alginate beads are employed as a site specific oral delivery system for cationic 
therapeutic agents, such as TGF-β₁, designed to target the agents to the luminal side 

of the small intestine. Improved delivery of bioactive material is obtained by: 
1) incorporating selected polyanions in the alginate beads to shield the cationic 

therapeutic agent from interaction with alginate and/or 2) acid treating alginate beads 
containing the therapeutic agents to reduce the molecular weight of alginate and its 

interaction with the agents. Enhanced bioactivity of therapeutic agents released from 
the alginate is attributed to the ability of polyacrylic acid to shield the agents from 

interaction with lower molecular fragments of acid treated alginate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for the oral 
delivery of cationic proteins for therapeutic purposes. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to alginate systems including synthetic polymer additives for the 
delivery of therapeutic agents, such as TGF-β1, in active form. Alginate is a copolymer of 1,4-linked β-D-mannuronic and α-L-guluronic 
acid. It has the unique property of gel-formation in the presence of divalent actions 
such as calcium, and has been used to immobilize cells (M.F.A. Goosen et al., 
"Microencapsulation of Living Tissue and Cells," Canadian Patent 1,215,922 (1982)), 
as potential artificial organs (M.F.A. Goosen et al., "Optimization of 
Microencapsulation Parameters: Semipermeable Microcapsules as a Bioartificial 
Pancreas," Biotech. Bioeng. 27:146-150 (1985)), and as delivery systems for drugs 
(C.K. Kim and E.J. Lee, "The Controlled Release of Blue Dextran from Alginate 
Beads," Int. J. Pharm. 79: 11-19 (1992)), pesticides (A.B. Pepperman et al., "Alginate 
Controlled Release Formulations of Metribuzin," J. Cont. Rel. 17:105-112 (1991)), 
and herbicides (G. Pfister et al., "Release Characteristics of Herbicides from 
Ca Alginate Gel Formulations," J. Cont. Rel. 3:229-233 (1986)). The gelation and 
crosslinking of alginate with calcium are due to the stacking of guluronic acid (G) 
blocks with the formation of 'egg-box' junctions (A. Katchalsky et al., "Counter-Ion 
Fixation in Alginates," J. Chem. Soc.   :5198-5204(1961)). Thus, the dropwise 
addition of an alginate solution into a stirred solution of calcium chloride and drug  
 
will result in the encapsulation of the drug within an alginate hydrogel bead containing 
up to 95% water (M.F.A. Goosen et al., "Microencapsulation of Living Tissue and 
Cells," Canadian Patent 1,215,922 (1982)). Purified alginate is non-toxic when taken orally, biodegradable and 
bioacceptable (C.K. Kim and E.J. Lee, "The Controlled Release of Blue Dextran from 
Alginate Beads," Int. J. Pharm. 79:11-19 (1992); O.N. Singh and D.J. Burgess, 
"Characterization of Albumin-Alginic Acid Complex Coacervation," J. Pharm. 
Pharmacol. 41:670-673 (1989)). Alginate has also been tested clinically as a 
component of synthetic pancreatic beta cells (as artificial pancreatic material). In 
addition, alginate has been found to have a protective effect on the mucous 
membranes of the upper gastrointestinal tract (D. Koji et al., "Pharmacological 
Studies of Sodium Alginate. I. Protective Effect of Sodium Alginate on Mucous 
Membrane
