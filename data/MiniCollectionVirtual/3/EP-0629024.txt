<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for latching and releasing two complementary connectors, including:   - an actuation element (9) which can move in a longitudinal insertion and separation direction of the two connectors between a first, latching, position of the two complementary connectors (1, 2) and a second, releasing, position; - at least one return lever (6) arranged in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction and a first end (31) of which is controlled by the actuation element (9) in order to move the lever (6) between a latching position in which a second end (34) of the lever (6) permits latching of the connection assembly and a releasing position.
