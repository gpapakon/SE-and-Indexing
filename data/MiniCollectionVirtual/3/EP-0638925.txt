<ABSTRACT>
A method for making an improved semiconductor 
device package is provided. A semiconductor die (16) is 

attached to a supportive substrate (10, 12). A 
protective lid (20) is attached to the supportive 

substrate (10, 12), over the semiconductor die (16). The 
protective lid (20) is partially encapsulated with 

molding compound (28). The protective lid (20) prevents 
the molding compound (30) from contacting the 

semiconductor die (16), and associated wirebonded wires 
(18). A portion (30) of the protective lid (20) remains 

exposed. Thus, a molded package compatible with current 
product designs and assembly processes is provided, yet 

disadvantages caused by molding compound contacting the 
die (16) and wires (18) are avoided. Furthermore, the 

exposed protective lid (30) provides superior heat 
dissipation for the package.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor 
devices, and more particularly, to semiconductor device 
packages comprising molded compounds. Conventionally, many semiconductor devices are 
packaged by being encapsulated in molding compounds. A 
compound typically used in the industry comprises novalac 
epoxy. More specifically, the typical conventional 
semiconductor device package comprises a supporting 
substrate on which a semiconductor die is mounted. The 
substrate may comprise a printed wire board, heatsink, 
leadframe, or the like, or integral combinations thereof. 
Electrical connections are typically made to the die via 
wire bonding. Conventionally, the supporting substrate, 
die and wire bonds are subsequently completely 
encapsulated with molding compound. Typically, leads 
extend from the compound for making electrical 
connections to the device. Alternately, conductive bumps 
may provide electrical connections to the semiconductor 
die. The conventional packaging technique, including the 
complete encapsulation of the wires and semiconductor die 
in molding compound, gives rise to a number of 
significant disadvantages. For example, during the 
molding process, the molding compound contacts the wire 
bonded wires. The wires are subject to being pushed 
toward one another, causing shorts. Additionally, the 
wire bonds may be broken as the molding compound moves 
through the wires. To avoid this, conventional molding  
 
processes must go to great lengths to make the molding 
compound extremely viscous, thus minimizing disturbing 
the wires. Furthermore, special, extremely expensive, 
molding compounds are used to obtain the required 
viscosity. An additional disadvantage occurring in 
conventional packaging processes is delamination of the 
molding compound from the semiconductor die. Ideally, 
the molding compound completely encapsulates the die, and 
remains in contact with the die throughout the life of 
the device. In practice, however, separation of the 
molding compound from the die may occur due to the 
difference in temperature characteristics such as 
coefficients of expansion, between the die and the 
compound. Conventionally, this problem is solved in part 
by employing extremely expensive molding compounds whose 
temperature characteristics are similar to the 
semiconductor die and other materials encapsulated. This 
problem is exaggerated as die size increases. A related problem is that mold compound on the die 
surface can lead to stress related failure of the device.
