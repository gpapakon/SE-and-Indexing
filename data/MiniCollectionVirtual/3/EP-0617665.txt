<ABSTRACT>
Multilayered barrier structures (10) comprising a gas barrier layer (12) of a non-chlorine containing organic polymer which is substantially impermeable to oxygen gas and a moisture barrier layer (14) of a mesophase propylene-based material are provided. These structures are environmentally compatible and radiation resistant, and exhibit one or more additional properties, including gas barrier properties, moisture barrier properties, toughness, heat sealability, softness, and quietness during wrinkling. Also provided are methods of preparing and using such multilayered barrier structures, and articles, such as films, pouches, and tubings, formed from these structures, as well as multilayer barrier structures with additional graft layers affixed thereto through the application of a dose of ionizing radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multilayered barrier structures
exhibiting one or more properties, including gas barrier
properties, moisture barrier properties, radiation resistance,
toughness, heat sealability, quietness during wrinkling, and
environmental compatibility. The invention also relates to
methods of preparing and using such multilayered barrier
structures, as well as to articles formed from such structures,
and to multilayered barrier structures with additional graft
layers affixed thereto.Multilayered structures which are both substantially
impervious to gases and/or moisture are well known in the medical
and food packaging industries. However, current structures
suffer from a variety of problems, including environmental
incompatibility, rapid deterioration after exposure to
sterilizing radiation, lack of toughness, ineffective heat
sealability, and an embarrassing tendency for personal care
articles manufactured from these structures, such as ostomy
pouches, to make noise due to wrinkling during use.Currently, poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC) is used as one
of the materials of choice for the gas barrier component of
barrier films. For ostomy applications, a film of PVDC
sandwiched between opposing layers of low density polyethylene
(LDPE) is widely used, with PVDC functioning as the gas barrier,
and LDPE as the moisture barrier. Also, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
can be used in the moisture barrier layer, or other layers, of
such a structure. However, disposal of these chlorine-containing
materials presents a number of environmental concerns, especially
relating to incineration of these materials after use in
hospitals or otherwise.Both PVDC and PVC are viewed as hazardous to the
environment and to personal health. Incineration of PVDC/PVC
results in release of hydrochloric acid (HCl), providing the
major portion of HCl in incinerator flue gases. Also, PVDC/PVC
is suspected of contributing to polychlorinated dibensodioxin and
furan toxins formed during incineration. Levels of these toxins
are up to three times greater in medical infectious waste as
compared to municipal waste streams. See e.g., Staff Report, 
"Proposed Dioxins Control Measure for Medical Waste
Incinerators", State of California, Air Resources Board,
Stationary Source Division, pp. 1-40 (May 25, 1990); Medical
Waste Policy committee, "Perspectives on Medical Waste", A Report
of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, State
University of New York (June, 1989). In addition to incineration
