<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a measuring/dispensing device for granular or powder products comprising: a tubular body (10; 100) applicable to the neck of a product container (51; 151) and closed by means of a cap (20; 120) provided with at least one lid (22; 122, 123). Said tubular body (10; 100) presents in its interior at least one diaphragm (30, 40; 140) which divides its inner volume, thereby defining a measuring chamber (43; 143) communicating with the interior of said container (51; 151) and a collecting chamber (42; 142) communicating with said measuring chamber. Both said chambers are limited in their upper area by said cap (20; 120) and said collecting chamber (42; 142) presents in its upper area in correspondence with the cap (20; 120) a dispensing duct (44; 144) for pouring out the product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a measuring/dispensing device for 
granular or powder substances, to be applied on the neck of 
a container. A number of measuring devices for powder or granular 
substances find an increasingly wider use on the market. 
Said devices are applied on containers and make it possible 
to measure the product properly and dispense their contents 
in constant quantities. Special reference is made to measuring devices for detergents 
for domestic use, as well as for products for personal 
hygiene. Some measuring devices belonging to the known technique 
consist of a complex apparatus with moving and fixed 
mechanisms. The fixed mechanisms into which the product 
enters when the container is capsized, allow the measuring 
of the product transferring it into a collecting chamber. 
From the collecting chamber the product which flows out 
through a dispensing duct is dispensed when the container 
is capsized again. The Italian patent application No. VI91A000092 in the name 
of the same inventor, foresees the realization of a measuring/dispensing 
device, consisting of a lower part presenting 
a collecting chamber suited to receive the measured 
product, and an upper part which is connected to the lower 
one, defining a pre-measuring chamber and a dispensing 
duct. The substance in the container enters into the measuring 
chamber when the container neck is turned upside down. 
From the measuring chamber the substance is conveyed into 
the collecting chamber when the container neck is brought 
back to its upright position, while the dispensing of the 
product occurs when the container is capsized again and the 
product flows out of the collecting chamber into the 
outside environment going through the dispensing duct.  
 Even though said device functions satisfactorily, it 
presents some inconveniences in that its production is 
rather costly because of the complex geometry of the surfaces 
forming it, which, therefore, require the construction 
of complex molds. Another inconvenience is that, since said device consists 
of various components, it is necessary to use several 
molds, one for each of the parts to be constructed. Moreover, 
it is necessary to foresee proper equipment for the 
assembly of the pieces. EP-A-0 410 620 discloses a simple measuring device for 
powder products with a lid connected to the dispensing 
chamber to dispense measured quantity of product. This 
document doesn't disclose a second lid to allow dispensing 
of continuous quantity of product. The main purpose of the

<CLAIMS>
A measuring/dispensing device for granular or 
powder products comprising: 


a tubular body (10; 100) presenting a first part (11; 
111), inserted in the neck of a product container (,51; 

151), and a second part (12; 112), arranged externally in relation to the first part and coaxially 
matched with the first part, provided with elements 

(13) connecting it rigidly with the neck of said container; 
a cap (20;120), connected with the tubular body through a 
first hinge (15; 115) which shuts with a snap on the rim of the 

tubular body, provided with at least a lid (22; 122, 123) 
connected with said cap through a second hinge (23; 124, 

125) and fit to be opened by rotation in relation to the body of the cap, said tubular body 
(10;100) presenting in its interior at least a diaphragm 

(30, 40; 140) dividing the inner volume of the device and defining a 
measuring chamber (43, 143), communicating with the interior 

of said container (51, 151) close to the end of said 
diaphragm, and a collecting chamber (42; 142) being connected 

with a dispensing duct (44; 144) arranged in the top 
section in correspondence with the cap (20; 120) and communicating 

with the outside environment, 
 
characterized in that said cap (20; 120) presents a first lid 

(22; 122) communicating through a first opening (25; 126) with the 
dispensing duct (44; 144) and a second lid (123) communicating 

through a second opening (127) with the measuring chamber 
(143). 
A measuring/dispensing device according to claim 
1, characterized in that said tubular body (100) presents 

in its interior a single diaphragm (140) arranged essentially 
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tubular 

body itself and running along a part of its length, said 
single diaphragm (140) defining with the inner wall of the 

tubular body wherein it is inserted, on one side the measuring 
chamber (143) communicating by means of the openings 

(131) with the interior of the container (151) and, on the  
 

opposite side, a duct (144) for dispensing the product, 
said measuring chamber (143) and said dispensing duct (144) 

communicating at the bottom with the same collecting chamber 
(142) defined between the end area of the tubular body 

(100) and the closing bottom (118) applied to it. 
A measuring/dispensing device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that said opening (131) setting into 

communication said measuring chamber (143) with the interior 
of the container (151) is through going in the tubular 

body (100) in correspondence with one portion of the same, 
which corresponds with said measuring chamber (143). 
A measuring/dispensing device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the cap (20; 120) matches with a snap 

the tubular body (10; 100) through a rim (16) in which an 
undercut (17) is present.
