<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for 
cleaning the anodes of electrolytic tanks, designed in 
particular for cleaning the anodes used in processes for 
the production of non-ferrous metals by electrolysis, 
such as zinc and copper. A further object of the 
invention is a machine for the realization of said 
cleaning procedure. During the process of electrolysis for the 
production of metals of the type indicated above, and in 
particular for the production of zinc and the like, a 
layer formed by sediments contained in the electrolyte, 
basically consisting of manganese dioxide (MnQ ), is 
deposited on the anode. This layer grows thicker with time and acts as an  
 
electrical resistance. As the width of the layer 
increases so does the voltage required to cause a certain 
current to flow, which confirms that the deposit 
increases the consumption of electrical energy and should 
therefore be eliminated in the most effective way 
possible if the optimum conditions in the process of 
electrolysis are to be maintained. Furthermore, the width of the layer increases in a 
uniform manner until it reaches a certain limit, after 
which kinds of trees are formed and which, once they have 
started, grow rapidly due to the fact that the conduction 
of current is greater through them as a result of the 
"points" effect and their increasingly shorter distance 
from the cathode. When one of these points touches a cathode a short 
circuit is produced. This short circuit always damages 
the anode, causing torsions or holes which, apart from 
deteriorating the anode, mean that lead is transferred to 
the electrolyte and later deposited with the zinc, making 
the production thereof impure. For these reasons, the anodes must be cleaned 
periodically in an effective and efficient way in order 
to ensure correct electrical behaviour and performance, 
and frequently enough to prevent the creation of possible 
short circuits which would contaminate the zinc deposits. Various procedures for carrying out the cleaning of 
the anodes in order to prevent the above mentioned 
problems are already known and among them it is worth 
mentioning the following three: 
a) By means of jets of water under pressure;  b) By means of plates with flat opposing surfaces 
between which the anode is situated and pressed; c) By means of metal brushes. The first of these systems requires equipment to 
supply water under pressure, said equipment requiring a  
 
high level of maintenance and giving rise to an excessive 
consumption of
