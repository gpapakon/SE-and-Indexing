<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is a device for controlling or damping the articulated movements between the two vehicle sections of an articulated bus about the vertical axis (6) of a live ring joint (1-3), in that the two vehicle sections are connected to one another so as to be capable of swivelling relative to one another about the vertical axis (6), a rotating ring (1 or 2) of the live ring joint (1-3) is assigned to one of the vehicle sections and a second rotating ring (2 or 1) of the live ring joint is assigned to the second vehicle section, the control or damping device being in addition a piston/cylinder unit. The piston (7) of the control or damping device (7, 8) is integrated into the one rotating ring (2) and the cylinder (7) of the device is integrated into the other rotating ring (1) of the live ring joint (1-3), preferably the cylinder of the control or damping device (7, 8) is formed by a groove (7) of the one rotating ring and the piston of the device is formed by a corresponding rib, engaging in the groove (7), of the other rotating ring.

A device for controlling or damping the bending 
motions between component vehicles of an articulated 

bus around the vertical axis (6) of a turntable joint 
(1 - 3), wherein the two component vehicles are 

connected to one another so as to be pivotable relative 
to one another around the vertical axis (6), a 

turntable ring (1, 2) of the turntable joint (1 - 3) 
being associated with one component vehicle and a 

second turntable ring (2, 1) of the turntable joint 
being associated with the second component vehicle and 

the control or damping device being a piston-cylinder 
unit, characterised in that the piston (7) of the 

control or damping device (7, 8) is associated with one 
turntable ring (2), and the cylinder (7) of the device 

is disposed in the other turntable ring (1) of the 
joint (1 - 3) so that the cylinder of the control or 

damping device (7, 8) is formed by a groove (7) in one 
ring (1) and the piston of the device is formed by a 

corresponding rib (8) engaging in the groove (7) and 
belonging to the other ring (1), the rib being shorter 

in the peripheral direction than the groove, which is 
filled with a flow medium. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the groove and the rib of the control and damping 

device (7, 8) extend with preset radial spacings 
parallel to the outer periphery of the respective 

turntable ring (1, 2). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the groove and the rib (7, 8) have a 

rectangular cross-section.  
 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the two end faces of the rib (8) 

are interconnected by a throttle bore (10) and the 
groove extends over the entire periphery of the 

turntable ring and has a fixed barrier wall (16) in the 
region between the ends of the rib. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by use of a magnetisable fluid and use of 

a control device for altering the viscosity of the 
fluid. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by a groove (7) in which a number of 

portions are formed by partitions (16) and variable-volume 
fluid chambers are formed by a rib portion in 

each groove portion and are connected to one another in 
throttled manner and filled with throttle fluid. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the fluid chambers at the two 

ends of the rib or of each rib portion are connected to 
one another via external throttle lines having an 

adjustable throttling effect. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised by use in conjunction with a turntable 

joint having two turntable rings which co-operate in 
the same manner as sliding bearings.
