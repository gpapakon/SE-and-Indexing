<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ID card and, particularly, 
to an ID card suitable for a mass production, excellent in 
durability, preventive of peeling a formed UV-setting 
protective layer off, capable of protecting a transferred 
image formed on an image-receiving layer extending over a long 
period of time, and capable of preserving an important 
personal information securely. Recently, a variety of ID cards have been popularized, 
namely, a status certificate, a member's certificate with his 
photograph, an authentication/identification card and a name 
card with his photograph, including a license such as a 
driver's license. Among the above-mentioned ID cards, an ID 
card such as a driver's license is comprised of a support on 
which a photograph of a driver's face is formed in a silver 
halide photographic process and a necessary information is  
 
recorded in a printing process and, further, a protective 
layer is provided thereon. The above-mentioned photograph of 
a driver's face formed in the silver halide photographic 
process is to be treated through a series of complicated 
multistaged processing steps such as the steps of an exposure, 
a development, a fixation and a bleaching treatment. It has 
not always been suitable to take this system in an actual 
field where a lot of ID cards are to be produced without 
delay. Under the above-mentioned recent circumstances, there 
have been proposed an ID card suitable and convenient for a 
mass production, that is prepared in such a manner that the 
surface of a support is provided with an image-receiving layer 
formed of a transferred-image such as an image having a 
gradation information in a sublimation type thermal-transfer 
recording system, or an image having a letter information in a 
thermally melting type thermal-transfer recording system, and 
a UV-setting protective resin is coated over the whole surface 
of the transferred-image formed on the image-receiving layer, 
so that a hard UV-setting protective layer may be formed by 
exposing it to UV rays. However, such an image-receiving layer as in the above-mentioned 
ID cards is added by a delaminating agent such as 
silicon with the purpose of preventing a thermally melting 
adhesion of both of the image-receiving layer and an ink-sheet 
for thermal-transfer recording use to each other when a  
 
transfer-image is formed by making use of the ink-sheet for 
thermal-transfer recording use. Therefore, a critical surface 
tension of the image-receiving layer is reduced, so that the 
adhesion

chelate is formed by reaction of a metal ion-containing 

compound and a dye represented by Formula I:  
   wherein X¹ represents an atomic group necessary for 

forming an aromatic ring provided that at least one of an 
aromatic ring is composed of 5 to 7 atoms, and at least one of 

neighboring atoms of X¹ coupling to an azo-bonding, is a 
nitrogen atom or a carbon atom substituted with a nitrogen 

atom, an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom; X² represents an atomic 
group necessary for forming an aromatic ring provided that at 

least one of an aromatic ring is composed of 5 to 7 atoms; and 
G represents a chelating group. 
The ID card of claim 1 further comprises a transparent 
protective layer.
