<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to an internal combustion engine has a plurality of pumping plungers (19) which are housed in respective bores (17). The plungers are movable inwardly in the bores but during such movement one of the plungers moves to an outer position in which a fuel supply passage (21) which communicates with a fuel supply passage (21) which communicates with a fuel outlet (22) is uncovered to the pump working chamber (20) defined at the inner ends of the bores. Each bore has a supply passage associated therewith. A cam ring (25) is provided to impart inward movement of the plungers and the cam ring is provided with cam lobes (26) on its internal peripheral surface however one of the cam lobes is replaced by a recess which allows the plungers to move outwardly in turn so that fuel is distributed to the outlets which in use are connected to the injection nozzles of an engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel pumping apparatus for 
supplying fuel to a multi cylinder internal combustion 
engine and of the kind comprising a plurality of cam 
actuated pumping plungers housed within respective bores 
defined in a body, the bores at their inner ends 
communicating with each other and forming a pump working 
chamber, a cam member having cam lobes formed thereon for 
actuating the pumping plungers to displace fuel from the 
pump working chamber, a pump drive shaft for imparting 
relative rotation between the body and the cam member, a 
plurality of outlet ports which are connected to the 
injection nozzles of the associated engine respectively, 
valve means responsive to the rotation of the pump drive 
shaft through which fuel displaced from the pump working 
chamber is supplied to the outlets in turn during 
successive delivery periods and means for supplying fuel 
to the pump working chamber between said delivery periods. In a known form of the apparatus as shown for example in 
EP-A-0364076, the aforesaid body comprises a rotary 
cylindrical member which is coupled to the drive shaft and 
which is located in a bore formed in a fixed housing of 
the apparatus. The rotary member has a so called delivery 
passage which communicates with the pump working chamber 
and opens onto the periphery of the rotary member. The 
delivery passage is positioned to register in turn with a 
plurality of outlet ports which open into the bore and 
which communicate with the outlets respectively so that 
each outlet receives fuel in turn. The machining of the 
bore in the housing and the surface of the distributor 
member requires a great deal of care. If the clearance 
between the two components is too great, the leakage of 
high pressure fuel will be unacceptable. On the other 
hand if the clearance is too small there is a risk of 
seizure of the two components when the 
apparatus is in use.  
 EP-A-0 548 000, which represents prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC, 
shows a fuel pumping apparatus having many features similar to the current 
invention, however having an electromagnetically controlled spill valve. The object of the current invention is to improve the known apparatus. This 
is achieved by arranging a cam actuated control valve for controlling the 
operation of the spill valve. An example of a fuel pumping apparatus in accordance with 
the invention will now be described with reference to the 
accompanying drawings in which:-

<CLAIMS>
A fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a 
multi cylinder internal combustion engine comprising a 

plurality of cam actuated pumping plungers (19) housed 
within respective bores (17) in a fixed body (10), the 

bores at their inner ends communicating with each other 
to form a pump working chamber (20), a cam member (25) 

having cam lobes (26) formed thereon for actuating the 
pumping plungers to displace fuel from the pump working 

chamber, a pump drive shaft (16) coupled to the cam 
member (25), a plurality of outlets (22) formed in the 

body and which are connected to the injection nozzles 
respectively of the associated engine, valve means (19, 

21) responsive to the rotation of the pump drive shaft 
through which fuel displaced from the pump working 

chamber (20) is supplied to the outlets (22) in turn 
during successive delivery periods said valve means (19) 

being housed in said body (10) and being interposed 
between the pump working chamber (20) and the outlets 

respectively means (36) for supplying fuel to the pump 
working chamber (20) between said delivery periods, a 

spill valve (40) operable to allow fuel to escape from 
said pump working chamber during the inward movement of 

the pumping plungers (19), and a control 
valve (48) for controlling the operation of the spill 

valve and cam elements (55) movable relative to the 
control valve (48) for actuating the control valve. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that said cam elements (55) are mounted on said cam 

member (25) and said control valve (48) is mounted in the 
body (10). 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised 
by a beam (51) which is mounted on an adjustable pivot 

(52), the beam defining a projection (54A) for engagement 
by the cam elements (55) and engaging an operating member  

 
of the control valve (48), the pivot being adjustable to 

vary the relative position of the body and cam member 
(25) at which the control valve (48) causes operation of 

the spill valve (40). 
An apparatus according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that said cam elements (55) are adjustably mounted on 

said cam member. 
An apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that each cam element (55) is of cylindrical form and 

its external surface is eccentric relative to an aperture 
therethrough which receives a securing screw. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that said valve means is defined by the pumping 

plungers respectively, and the cam member (25) is 
arranged so that prior to displacement of fuel from the 

pump working chamber (20) one of the plungers is moved to 
a position to allow fuel flow from the pump working 

chamber (20) to one of the outlets (22), the plungers 
being moved to said position in turn so that the outlets 

(22) receive fuel in turn. 
An apparatus according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that said pumping plungers (19) when in said position 

uncover to the pump working chamber ports formed in the 
respective bores (17), the ports through respective 

outlet passages (21), communicating with said outlets

An apparatus according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the cam member (25) at one angular position is 

provided with a recess (27) whereby the pumping plungers 
cam move outwardly to said position in turn.  

 
An apparatus according to Claim 8, characterised 
by a cam profile in said recess (27) said cam profile 

acting to impart limited inward movement to the plunger 
at said position at the same time as the inward movement 

of the remaining plungers.
