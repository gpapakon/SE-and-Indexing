<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for reversibly
ionizing or nonionizing a rhodium-containing catalyst, which makes it
possible to recycle the catalyst, and a hydroformylation
process that utilizes such reversible ionization or
nonionization.The present invention is also concerned with a
process for producing an aldehyde by the use of the
rhodium-containing catalyst, and a process for recovering
the hydroformylating catalyst from a hydroformylation
reaction mixture.The reaction of converting an ethylenically
unsaturated compound into an aldehyde by allowing it to
react with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of
a catalyst is called hydroformylation or oxo synthesis. 
It is industrially very highly valuable to utilize this
reaction for the production of aldehydes.Catalysts used in such hydroformylation commonly
include cobalt compounds and rhodium compounds. In view
of their catalytic activities and their properties of
selective formation of aldehydes, the latter rhodium
compounds are known to be superior to the former cobalt
compounds.Such rhodium compounds can be exemplified by rhodium
salts such as rhodium oxide and rhodium complexes such as
rhodium carbonyl. These may be used alone. In order to
improve stability of these compounds or improve their
catalytic activities, however, they are rather used in the
form of complexes modified with ligands such as organic
phosphorus compounds, organic arsenic compounds or organic
antimony compounds.Among these ligands, organic phosphorus compounds
are preferably used in view of their toxicity and
production cost. Of the organic phosphorus compounds, the
state in which a phosphorus atom is bonded or the types of
substituents bonded to the phosphorus atom are selected
properly according to the types of the starting material
ethylenically unsaturated compounds and those of desired
aldehydes. More specifically, compounds such as tertiary
phosphines or phosphites, the number of phosphorus atoms 
that indicates whether the ligands are unidentate,
bidentate or higher and the type of substituents that
indicates whether the ligands are alkyl-substituted or
phenyl-substituted are used properly in appropriate
geometry.As examples in which organic phosphorus compounds
are used as the ligands of hydroformylating catalysts
comprised of a rhodium compound, the following are
proposed.
(A) When straight-chain aldehydes are selectively
produced, a rhodium compound is modified with a tertiary
phosphine (Japanese Patent Publication No. 45-10730);(B) when branched-chain
