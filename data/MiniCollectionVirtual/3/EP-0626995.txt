<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous hard surface detergent
composition containing calcium ion which provides improved solution feel
without deteriorating storage stability of the composition. The composition is
particularly useful for dishwashing liquids, more particularly under soft water
conditions.Anionic surfactants such as alkyl ethoxy sulfates with short ethylene
oxide chains, alkyl sulfates, alkyl benzene sulfonates, a-olefin sulfonates, and
alkyl ethoxy carboxylates are known to be very effective for hard surface
cleaning, but are also known to have more or less unfavorable "slippery" feel in
use. This undesirable attribute is a problem to hard surface cleaning
compositions, especially for dishwashing purposes.There is therefore a considerable demand for a hard surface detergent
composition which has good detergency and good storage stability while
having good solution feel when cleaning and rinsing, particularly for
dishwashing purposes. As defined herein, good solution feel is best defined as
the absence of "slippery" or "slimy" feel, or a "draggy" kind of feel which one
feels when the composition is in use. "Good solution feel" is an important
attribute for commercial liquid detergent products. Those wash solutions
which have good solution feel on hands and objects to be cleaned allow easy
handling of the objects, and provide good rinsing characters. Such benefits are
most appreciated for dishwashing purposes.Many attempts have been made to improve solution feel using various
technology. These attempts are usually directed towards the use of nonionic-type
surfactants, and other suds enhancing-type and solvent-type components. 
Generally, these compositions have sacrificed detergency to obtain the
improved solution feel.Kokoku 46-43550 (Kao Corporation) teaches a liquid detergent
composition which is mild to skin and has good detergency comprising alkaline
earth metal salts of certain alkyl alkylene-oxy sulfate and certain alkyl alkylene-oxy
carboxylates.Kokai 51-125405 (The Procter & Gamble Company) teaches
compositions comprising calcium and magnesium salts of anionic surfactants
including alkyl ether sulfates and amine oxides, C1-5 alkanols and water,
wherein the weight ratio of amine oxide to anionic surfactant is 1:100 to 1:2.
Up to about 25% of the anionic surfactants can be monovalent salts.U.S. Patent 2,766,212 (General Aniline and Film Corporation) teaches
compositions which comprise alkyl ether alkoxy sulfate salts and water soluble
polyvalent salts of magnesium, calcium,
