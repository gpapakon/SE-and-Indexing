Plate-screw implant, of which the plate which is screwed to the femur has 
arranged upon it an articulated tube element designed to receive and locate so 

as to prevent rotation the slide-in thread-free shank section of the screw, 

characterised in that
, in order to set the angle (α) between the plate (1) and the 
articulated tube (2), the latter is pivot mounted on the plate (1) to facilitate 

rotation around a parallel axis (6) extending to the plate centre plane (A-A), may 
be slewed around the axis (6) by means of an adjusting transmission unit 

designed as an externally accessible gear assembly, and may be locked in the 
set angular position. 
Implant according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the angle (α) between the 
plate (1) and the articulated tube (2) is adjustable within a range of 85° - 155°. 
Implant according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 a detent or catch is 
provided for locking the articulated tube (2) in the set angular position. 
Implant according to at least one of Claims 1 - 3, 
characterised in that
 two 
prong-like arms (7) are formed at the end of the plate (1) on which the articulated 

tube (2) is pivot-mounted. 
Implant according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the longitudinal axes (C-C) 
of the prong-like arms (7) are inclined away from the bone contact face (8) of the 

plate (1). 
Implant according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the angle of inclination (β) 
between the longitudinal axes (C-C) of the prong-like arms (7) and the plate 

centre plane (A-A) lies in the region 10° - 12°.  
 
Implant according to at least one of Claims 4 - 6 
characterised in that
, formed in 
the prong-like arms (7) are bearing pins on which the articulated tube (2) is pivot-mounted. 
Implant according to at least one of Claims 3 - 7, 
characterised in that
 a 
serrated segment (9) is arranged or formed on the section of the articulated tube 

(2) extending between the prong-like arms (7), which serrated segment (9) 
meshes with a drive wormgear (10) which is mounted in the web section of the 

fork formed by the prong-like arms (7) of the plate (1). 
Implant according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the wormgear drive formed 
by the serrated segment (9) and the drive worm (10) is of self-locking design. 
Implant according to Claims 8 or 9, 
characterised in that
 a socket wrench 
connection is formed on the externally accessible end of the drive worm. 
Implant according to one of Claims 7 - 10, 
characterised in that
 the bearing 
pins in the prong-like arms (7) are of insertion or screw-in design.
