<ABSTRACT>
A raw sewage disposal apparatus capable of easily 
stirring raw sewage and cleaning a container by rotating the 

container per se in case of introducing the raw sewage into 
the container and heating, evaporating and drying the raw 

sewage. The raw sewage disposal apparatus comprises a 
container for raw sewage, an induction heater (34) for 

heating the sewage, a holder (38) for rotatably holding the 
container, a driver (20) for rotating the container, 

spherical stirrers (33) accommodated in the container, and a 
non-rotatable baffle (46, 47, 48) extending into the bottom 

of the container so as to contact the stirrers (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a raw sewage disposal 
apparatus for disposing of raw sewage, which apparatus can 
be portable to be utilised outside or in a vehicle such as a 
vessel or train, or in a tunnel or other location 
inaccessible to a vacuum truck used for collecting raw 
sewage and, more particularly, relates to such an apparatus 
capable of performing the stirring of the raw sewage and 
cleaning, of a drying cauldron by rotating the drying 
cauldron itself. Conventionally the raw sewage from human bodies is 
typically discharged into a sewage system by use of a flush 
toilet or the like and then flows into a river after being 
temporarily contained in a holding tank and purified 
therein. However, at events such as festivals, athletic 
events, fairs, meetings and the like, temporary toilet 
facilities must be provided for the disposal of the raw 
sewage. Conventionally portable temporary toilets are employed, 
most of which have a tank for temporarily storing the raw 
sewage therein. However, the temporary toilets have the 
problem that the raw sewage contained in the tank must be 
sucked into a vacuum truck for collection and the collected 
raw sewage must be transferred to a raw sewage disposal 
purifying facility, which is laborious and time consuming 
and is unhygienic. Vehicles, such as trains, buses, water vessels which 
operate over long distances are provided with a tank 
exclusively used for storing and holding the discharged raw  
 
sewage. The raw sewage in the tank is subjected to a 
deodorising treatment by chemicals and is thereafter 
collected by a vacuum truck at a terminal or relaying point. As mentioned above, the raw sewage in conventional 
temporary toilets or movable transportation facilities is 
contained as it is discharged from the human body and is 
collected thereafter. Accordingly, the storing method, the 
collection method and the disposal method are not modern and 
are very unhygienic. If the temporary toilet has been used 
for a long period of time, the discharged raw sewage 
remaining in the tank causes a bad smell. Operators dislike disposing of the raw sewage which is 
a disadvantage in regard to maintenance of the temporary 
toilet. In an attempt to ameliorate the above problems, there 
have been proposed several hygienic disposal methods. In 
one method often employed in vehicles chemicals are 
introduced into the tank where the raw sewage is contained 
to prevent the generation of the bad smell and to sterilise 
the sewage. This method cannot be used for
