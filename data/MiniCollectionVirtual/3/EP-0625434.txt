<ABSTRACT>
A caster wheel assembly 1' for a shopping trolley 
comprises a support member 2' fixed to a trolley chassis, 

a carrier member 4' freely rotatable about a vertical axis 
5' with respect to the support member 2', and a wheel 6' 

carried by the carrier member 4' so as to be rotatable 
about a horizontal axis 7' offset from the vertical axis 

5'. A cam follower 24' in the form of two planet wheels 
26' rotatably mounted on a lower portion 30 of the support 

member 2' engages a cam surface 21' having an undulating 
profile on the carrier member 4' in order to bias the wheel 

6' of the assembly towards a direct forward line. In order 
to steer the trolley to one side or the other of the direct 

forward line, a sufficient steering force must be applied 
to the trolley in order to overcome this biasing action, 

and this overcomes any tendency of the trolley to move in 
a direction other than the intended direction of travel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to caster wheel 
assemblies, and is concerned more particularly, but not 
exclusively, with such assemblies for fitting to shopping 
trolleys, luggage trolleys and the like. Conventionally shopping trolleys are fitted with 
caster wheel assemblies which are such as to enable the 
trolley to be steered in the required direction by simply 
applying a steering force in that direction to the handle 
of the trolley. Because the wheel of each assembly is 
mounted on a carrier member which is freely rotatable about 
a vertical axis and the wheel is rotatable about a 
horizontal axis offset from that vertical axis, the wheel 
will be automatically orientated by the steering force in 
the intended direction of travel. However, because the 
carrier member of each assembly is freely rotatable about 
a vertical axis, there is a tendency for the wheels to 
become aligned along a direction other than the intended 
direction of travel, particularly when the ground is not 
flat or under conditions where the trolley is heavily 
loaded, and this can result in unpredictable movements of 
the trolley which may cause damage or injury. It is an object of the invention to provide a new 
form of caster wheel assembly which renders movements of 
the trolley, or other vehicle to which the assembly is 
attached, more predictable. This object is achieved by the caster wheel 
assembly which is the subject of the accompanying claims.  Such assemblies, which are preferably made in 
such a manner as to enable them to be fixed to existing 
trolleys in place of conventional caster wheel assemblies, 
may be designed to ensure that the trolley moves only in a 
direct forward line unless deliberately directed out of 
this line by application of a suitable steering force to 
the handle of the trolley. In order that the invention may be more fully 
understood, two caster wheel assemblies in accordance with 
the invention will now be described, by way of example, 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a vertical section through a first 
assembly with the wheel orientated to one side; Figures 2 and 3 show parts of the first assembly; Figure 4 is a vertical section through the first 
assembly with the wheel orientated towards the front; Figure 5 is a diagram showing the profile of the 
cam surface in developed view (over only one half of the 
circumference); and Figure 6 is a side view of a second assembly. Referring to Figures 1 and 4, the first caster 
wheel assembly 1 comprises a support

<CLAIMS>
A caster wheel assembly comprising a fixed 
support member (2, 2'), a carrier member (4, 4') freely 

rotatable about a vertical axis (5, 5') with respect to the 
support member (2, 2'), and a wheel (6, 6') carried by the 

carrier member (4, 4') so as to be rotatable about a 
horizontal a
xis (7, 7') offset from said vertical axis (5, 
5'), characterised by biasing means (21, 24; 21', 24') for 

biasing the carrier member (4, 4') about said vertical axis 
(5, 5') towards a predetermined orientation with respect to 

the support member (2, 2'). 
A caster wheel assembly according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the biasing means comprises a cam 

surface (21, 21') on one of the members (2, 4') and a cam 
follower (24, 24') on the other member (4, 2') engaging the 

cam surface (21, 21'). 
A caster wheel assembly according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the cam surface (21, 21') has an 

undulating profile, there being limited freedom of vertical 
movement between the members (2, 4; 2', 4') so as to permit 

the cam follower (24, 24') to follow the undulating profile 
of the cam surface (21, 21') during relative rotation of 

the members (2, 4; 2', 4') and so that the cam follower 
(24, 24') will tend to be biased towards a position 

corresponding to said predetermined orientation by a 
downwardly acting force exerted on the assembly. 
A caster wheel assembly according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the cam surface (21, 21') is annular 

 
and has a profile comprising crests (28) and troughs (29) 

alternating about its circumference. 
A caster wheel assembly according to claim 2, 3 
or 4, characterised in that the cam follower (24, 24') 

comprises at least one planet wheel (26, 26') rotatable 
about a transverse axis relative to said vertical axis (5, 

5'). 
A caster wheel assembly according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the cam follower (24') is provided on 

the support member (2') and comprises two planet wheels 
(26') mounted on opposite sides of the support member (2'). 
A caster wheel assembly according to any one of 
claims 2 to 6, characterised in that the cam surface (21') 

is constituted by an upper surface of a bearing element 
fixed to the carrier member (4'). 
A caster wheel assembly according to any 
preceding claim, characterised in that the support member 

(2, 2') incorporates a tubular part (8, 8') within which a 
shaft part (17) of the carrier member (4, 4') is received. 
A caster wheel assembly according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the tubular part (8, 8') of the 

support member (2, 2') has an external screwthread (11) for 
attachment of the assembly to a trolley. 
A trolley incorporating at least one caster wheel 
assembly according to any preceding claim.
