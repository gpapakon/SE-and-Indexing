<ABSTRACT>
An integrated computer terminal integrates both mechanically and 
electrically a computer terminal with a monitor. A first circuit board contains 

computer terminal logic electronics and output video amplifiers from the monitor 
display electronics, with the output video amplifiers providing an RGB signal for 

display on a monitor display device. A second circuit board contains a power 
supply for both circuit boards, and contains deflection circuitry. The computer 

terminal logic electronics from the first circuit board provides video sync signals 
directly to the deflection circuitry on the second circuit board, which in turn 

provides deflection signals for the monitor display device. A single, EMI-shielded 
housing contains the circuit boards and the monitor display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to computer terminals, and more particularly 
to an integrated computer terminal that integrates computer terminal logic 
electronics with the monitor display electronics. Currently computer terminals are used in conjunction with monitors and 
are generally contained in separate cabinets. The computer terminal is accessed 
by a keyboard or other standard interface device and transmits analog voltages, 
representing the RGB color components and sync for a video signal, to the 
monitor in a standard format, such as RS-343, over a coaxial cable. The 
requirement of providing the video in the standard format results in the use of 
encoders, which further complicates the circuitry within the computer terminal. 
The RGB components are input to video amplifiers as part of the display 
electronics in the monitor and the sync is separated from the RGB components 
to drive a deflection circuit so that the video signal is displayed as an image on 
a monitor display device, such as a CRT. A block diagram of this terminal 
configuration is shown in Fig. 1. The monitor includes the display device and at 
least two circuit boards -- one board containing a power supply and the deflection 
circuit and another board containing the video amplifiers. The monitor also 
includes front panel controls for brightness and contrast that provide signals that 
affect the gain and d.c. offset of the video amplifiers, and may include a display 
microprocessor as part of the display electronics. The computer terminal includes 
at least two circuit boards -- one for a power supply and another for the logic 
circuitry that includes a microprocessor, a frame buffer and a digital to analog 
converter. The separate cabinets, one for the computer terminal and the other for the 
monitor, with separate EMI shields result in potential EMI problems when the 
video signal leaves the computer terminal and enters the monitor. Various 
attempts, including special cabling, have been made to overcome these problems. 
In some instances the elimination of separate cabinets has been implemented by  
 
mechanically placing the monitor and computer terminal within a common 
cabinet with a single EMI shield. However no electrical integration has been 
attempted so that there are still at least four circuit boards in the integrated 
cabinets. Finally for monitors that provide digital controls for contrast and 
brightness there is the separate display microprocessor within the monitor. What is desired is an integrated computer
