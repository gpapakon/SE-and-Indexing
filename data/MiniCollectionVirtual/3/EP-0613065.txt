<ABSTRACT>
A developing device, for use with a one-component 
developer composed of coloured fine synthetic resin 

toner particles, comprises a vessel (118), supported so 
as to be movable towards and away from a photosensitive 

drum (126), for holding the developer, and a developing 
roller rotatably provided within the vessel (118), a 

portion of the roller being exposed from the vessel and 
resiliently pressed against a surface of the 

photosensitive drum (126) when the device is in use. 
The toner particles are entrained by the developing 

roller to form a developer layer therearound, and are 
carried to the surface of the photosensitive drum (126) 

for development of an electrostatic latent image formed 
thereon. An electric motor (130) for rotating the 

developing roller is attached to the vessel so as to 
move therewith relative to the photosensitive drum. In 

this way, the developing roller can be pressed stably 
and uniformly against the drum even when the motor is 

working.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to developing devices 
for use in electrophotographic apparatus, wherein an 
electrostatic latent image is visually developed by using 
a one-component developer, particularly a non-magnetic 
type one-component developer. The present application is 
a divisional application of European Patent application 
no. 90305946.7 (EP-A-0401020). As is well known, an electrophotographic 
printer carries out the processes of: producing a 
uniform distribution of electrical charges on a surface 
of an electrostatic latent image carrying body such as 
an electrophotographic photoreceptor; forming an 
electrostatic latent image on the electrically charged 
surface of the electrophotographic photoreceptor by 
optically writing an image thereon, using a laser beam 
scanner, an LED (light emitting diode) array, an LCS 
(liquid crystal shutter) array or the like; visually 
developing the electrostatic latent image with a 
developer, i.e., toner, which is electrically charged 
to be electrostatically adhered to the electostatic 
latent image zone; electrostatically transferring the 
developed visible image to a paper; and fixing the 
transferred image on the paper. Typically, the 
electrophotographic photoreceptor is formed as a 
photosensitive drum having a cylindrical conductive 
substrate and a photoconductive insulating film bonded 
to a cylindrical surface thereof. In the developing process, a two-component 
developer composed of a toner component (colored fine 
synthetic resin particles) and a magnetic component 
(magnetic fine carriers) is widely used, as it enables a 
stable development of the latent image. Note, typically 
the toner particles have an average diameter of about 10 
Âµm, and the magnetic fine carriers have a diameter ten  
 
times larger than the average diameter of the toner 
particles. Usually, a developing device using the 
two-component developer includes a vessel for holding 
the two-component developer, wherein the developer is 
agitated by an agitator provided therein. This 
agitation causes the toner particles and the magnetic 
carriers to be subjected to triboelectrification, 
whereby the toner particles are electrostatically 
adhered to each of the magnetic carriers. The 
developing device also includes a magnetic roller, 
provided in the vessel as a developing roller, in such a 
manner that a portion of the magnetic roller is exposed 
therefrom and faces the surface of the photosensitive 
drum. The magnetic carriers with the toner particles 
are magnetically

device (10) comprises: 

a vessel (118), supported so as to be movable 
towards and away from an electrostatic latent image 

carrying body (126), for holding the developer; 
a developing roller (128), extending within

latent image carrying body can be brought about by 

moving the carriage.
