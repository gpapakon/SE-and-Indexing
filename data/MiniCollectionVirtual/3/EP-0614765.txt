<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preventing 
counterfeiting of sales receipts and, more 
particularly, through the use of novel indicia for 
both fixed and variable information. Patent 4,957,312 is directed to a similar 
objective and featured a split ribbon to produce two 
color numbers and letters. It also suggested adding a 
component to the ribbon which was visible only under 
ultraviolet (UV) illumination. The use of such UV 
responsive components for security purposes is well 
known -- see for example Patent 3,599,229. The instant invention improves upon the prior art 
teachings by first printing fixed information on 
register rolls with photoluminescent ink (UV 
responsive). These rolls are then transferred to the 
retailer who installs the same in registers. 
Thereafter the method involves printing the sales 
receipt slip with variable information with 
photoluminesent ink. Finally, upon attempted return 
of merchandise covered by the sales slip, it is 
scanned under UV illumination to determine the 
presence of both the fixed and variable information. The fixed information referred to above is that 
common to all of the sales receipts and usually will 
include information on the seller whereas the variable 
information will change from receipt to receipt 
depending upon the merchandise purchased.  The invention is explained in conjunction with the 
accompanying drawing which is schematic representation 
of the steps employed in the practice of the inventive 
method. Referring now to the drawing, the first step is 
performed by the manufacturer of the register rolls 
who prints the same with ink containing a UV 
responsive component. This is advantageously done on 
a press which imprints the name and/or logo of the 
retailer or other patterned information at 
longitudinally spaced portions on the web and rewinds 
the web upon a core suitable for installation in the 
retailer's register or other computing machine. The thus-completed rolls (bearing the "fixed" 
information) are then shipped to the manufacturer's 
customer, i.e., the retailer. This second step is 
represented by the second box in the drawing. The retailer then installs the rolls in its 
register in conventional fashion -- this third step 
being referred to in the third box of the drawing. Upon a sale, the fourth step includes printing the 
"variable" information on a portion of the roll and 
normally would include the identification of the 
merchandise, the date of sale, the cost, etc. which is 
detached from the roll and

<CLAIMS>
A method of preventing counterfeiting of sales 
receipts comprising the steps of: 

   providing at a manufacturing site a first ink 
having as a component one that is visible only under 

ultraviolet light, 
   providing at said manufacturing site an elongated 

web of receipt paper convolutely wound into a roll, 
   unwinding said roll and printing fixed information 

with said first ink in a plurality of longitudinally 
spaced places on said roll, 

   rewinding the printed paper into a roll, 
   transferring the printed roll to a point of sales 

site, 
   providing at said sales site a ribbon having a 

second ink having as a component one that is visible 
only under ultraviolet light, 

   installing said ribbon in register means equipped 
with means adapted to print variable information 

through said ribbon on said roll, 
   creating different variable information for each 

of said longitudinally spaced places on said roll and 
introducing said variable information into said 

register means, 
   printing different variable information on each of 

said longitudinally spaced places on said roll, 
   detaching a portion of said roll carrying both 

said fixed and variable information relative to 
purchased merchandise and giving it as a sales receipt 

to the purchaser, and 
   upon attempted return of the merchandise 

subjecting the said sales receipt to ultraviolet light 
examination to determine the presence of both said 

fixed and variable information. 
The method of claim 1 in which said steps 
include providing each of said first and second inks 

with the same component.
