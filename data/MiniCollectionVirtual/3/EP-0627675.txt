<ABSTRACT>
A diffractive optical device is to be specified having a diffractive structure (2) extended over a surface for the optical imaging of a space point onto a plurality of other space points, whose calculation and encoding are permitted by a controllable set of structure data, which device, furthermore, in spite of a high fan-out, exhibits an acceptable beam quality and whose efficiency is 40% or distinctly higher. For this purpose, the diffractive structure (2) has a plurality of structure partial regions (21) illuminated by a light beam, each of which structure partial regions directs at least a proportion of the part of the illuminating beam incident upon it to another space point allocated to this structure partial region, independently of the remaining structure partial regions. Application for optical signal distribution in computers, at the board level or the chip level.

Diffractive optical device (1) for optically
imaging a defined space point (10) onto at least two

other space points (11), comprising

a two-dimensionally extended structure (2), which
diffracts light in a defined fashion, for illuminating

with the aid of a light beam (3) from one space point
(10),
the light-diffracting structure (2) having several
structural subregions (21), each (21) of which directs

at least a fraction of an illuminating light beam (3)
falling onto this structural subregion (21) onto

another space point (11), assigned to this structural
subregion (21), in such a way that fractions of the

light beam (3) falling onto the light-diffracting
structure (2) are directed onto each of the other space

points (11), and
a group (200) of at least two structural subregions
(21) arranged at a spacing from one another directs

light onto only one of the at least two other space
points (11), such that each structural subregion (21)

of this group (200) directs light striking this group
(200) only onto this one other space point (21) and not

onto another space point (21) differing from this other
space point (21).
Device according to Claim 1, the structural
subregions (21) of the group (200) being distributed 

over the entire surface of the light-diffracting
structure (2).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, the
structural subregions (21) of the light-diffracting

structure (2) adjoining one another without gaps.
Device according to Claim 3, each structural
subregion (21) defining a polygon (211, 212, 213).
Device according to Claim 4, each structural
subregion (21) defining a hexagon (212).
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, each structural subregion (21) having a

diffraction grating structure (210).
Device according to Claim 6, the diffraction
grating structures (210) of structural subregions (21),

which direct light onto mutually differing other space
points (11), differing from one another.
Device according to Claim 7, the diffraction
grating structures (210) of the structural subregions

(21) of each group (200), which direct light onto only
one other space point (11), being sections from a

common master structure.
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 8, the
diffraction grating structure (210) of a structural

subregion (21) exhibiting relief.
Device according to Claim 9, a relief-type
diffraction grating structure (210) having a sawtooth

profile.
Device according to Claim 9 or 10, a relief-type
diffraction grating structure (210) having a

graduated profile.
Device according to Claim 11, the graduated
profile being a stepped profile.
Device according to one of Claims 9 to 12, a
relief-type diffraction grating structure (210)

corresponding to a section from a Fresnel zone plate.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, the surface of the diffracting structure (2) 

having an oval edge (20) defining an aperture of the
device.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, in particular according to Claim 3 or 4, the

structural subregions (21) in the surface of the
diffracting structure (2) being longitudinally extended

in the direction (22) of a largest mean deflecting
angle (a) defined by the position of all the other

space points (11), between an axis (30) of the light
beam (3) and an axis (310) common to all component

beams (31) directed from the diffracting structure (2)
onto the other space points (11).
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, one space point (11), (10) being defined by an

exit window of an optical transmitter (40) generating
the light beam (3).
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, another space point (11) being defined by a

light entry window of an optical receiver (61) for
receiving a light power of the component (31), directed

onto this window, of the light beam (3).
