<ABSTRACT>
An article of paper machine clothing for use in the pressing or drying section of a paper making machine has a sheet-contacting layer having a glazed surface. The glazing of the surface may be effected through the application of heat and/or pressure, and provides the paper machine clothing with an extremely smooth, and almost completely sealed, surface. The article may be used on the press section of a paper making machine adapted to carry out an impulse drying process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL FABRICS FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE PRESSING APPLICATIONSTechnical Field This invention relates to paper making machine fabrics, commonly referred to as paper machine clothing.Background Art The textile structures normally used as clothing in the pressing section of a paper making machine consist generally of a woven base structure covered by a layer of batt fibers needled thereto.The process of paper making comprises the deposit of a slurry of the paper making constituents on a forming fabric and then deliquifying the slurry to produce a self-coherent sheet. This sheet is then transported on a fabric to various stations at which deliguification is progressed to produce the final paper sheet. Deliguification is usually effected by a combination of pressing and drying at elevated temperatures together with various other treatments that may be desirable depending, of course, upon the final grade and type of paper to be produced. The combination of pressing and drying, together with the quality and nature of the fiber constituents, will determine the quality of the end product.The primary functions of the paper machine clothing and, in particular, of the press fabrics are to absorb paper expressed from the paper sheet in the press nip, to support the sheet in the press nip, to prevent crushing, to provide uniform pressure distribution over the paper in the nip between the press rolls, and to impart the desired surface finish to the sheet during its passage through the pressing and drying sections. At the same time, the paper 

 machine clothing or press fabric in contact with the sheet serves to equalize pressure distribution during pressing, and to eliminate or to reduce shadow marking which may be caused by grooves or suction pressure rolls. The item of paper making machine clothing also serves to transfer the sheet from one position to another, and to act as a power transmission belt for driving all the undriven rolls in the machine.To perform these various functions, therefore, the paper making machine clothing requires demanding properties which are capable of being maintained on a continuous basis in a very rigorous chemical environment. A paper machine fabric, particularly a press fabric, should be capable of extended operations without substantial degradation of its performance. The high loading of the fabric in the press nip, however, produces over a period of time mechanical damage to components of the fabric, and this, in practice, limits the longevity of the fabric and the consistency of the

What Is Claimed Is:
1. In an article of paper machine clothing for use in high temperature pressing applications, said applications being those in which a paper machine press roll temperature is greater than 250°F, said article comprising a woven support layer and a sheet- contacting surface layer, said sheet-contacting surface layer being a carded batt of staple fibers needled into said woven support layer, the improvement comprising a glazed surface on said sheet-contacting surface layer, said glazed surface being provided by subjecting said sheet-contacting surface layer to a temperature in excess of 250°F under elevated compression applied in a direction perpendicular thereto, whereby said article of paper machine clothing may provide exceptionally high sheet dryness values.
2. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 1 wherein said glazed surface is a microporous surface.
3. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 1 wherein said glazed surface is a partially sealed surface.
4. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 1 wherein said glazed surface is smooth.
5. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 1 wherein said staple fibers comprise aromatic polyamide fibers.
6. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 5 wherein said aromatic polyamide fibers are a mixture of poly(meta-phenylene isophthalamide) fibers and poly(para-phenylene terephthalamide) fibers.
7. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 1 wherein said staple fibers comprise a mixture of fibers of fluoropolymers or copolymers of 


 fluoropolymers and other high temperature resistant fibers.
8. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 7 wherein said fluoropolymer is polytetrafluoroethylene and said other high temperature resistant fibers are fibers of polyaryletherketones or polyphenylene sulfide.
9. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 1 wherein said staple fibers are cross-linked polyamide fibers.
10. An article of paper machine clothing as claimed in claim 9 wherein said polyamide is cross-linked through a treatment with an aqueous formaldehyde solution.
