<ABSTRACT>
A method of converting non-densified alpha-phase 
silicon nitride to beta-phase silicon nitride which 

includes heating a walled container enclosing a non-densified 
alpha-phase silicon nitride mass to an elevated 

temperature for a sufficient length of time so that the 
non-densified alpha-phase silicon nitride mass converts to 

a beta-phase silicon nitride mass. The walled container 
is formed of a silicon nitride-containing material 

which is stable at temperatures of at least 1700°C and is 
compatible with silicon nitride. Additionally, the walled 

container has an opening therein to allow placement of 
the non-densified alpha-phase silicon nitride mass 

therein. 
Also disclosed is a furnace (60) for converting silicon 
nitride from a predominantly alpha-phase material to a 

predominantly beta-phase material which inhibits the 
silicon nitride from thermally decomposing or being 

adversely effected by the furnace interior. The furnace 
includes a) an interior conversion zone C3 having a lining 

64 formed of a silicon nitride-containing material which 
is stable at temperatures of at least about 1700°C and is 

compatible with silicon nitride; b) means for heating 76" 
the interior conversion zone C3 to a temperature of at 

least about 1700°C; and c) means (98) for providing a 
selected gas into the atmosphere of the interior 

conversion zone C3. 
Also disclosed is the beta-phase silicon nitride made 
by the methods or in the apparatus of this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
converting alpha-phase silicon nitride to beta-phase
silicon nitride, an apparatus used therefor, and the
silicon nitride made thereby.Generally, sintered silicon nitride has been
manufactured in batch operations by first placing a
silicon nitride article in a refractory material
container, formed typically of graphite. A setter powder
of silicon nitride or boron nitride or a mixture thereof
is then poured into the container to cover the silicon
nitride articles being sintered to protect them from
thermal decomposition and reaction with the furnace
materials. The setter powder-covered silicon nitride
article is then placed in a batch-type furnace to sinter
the silicon nitride. Without this protection, experience
has shown that a silicon nitride article will decompose
at temperatures above 1700°C in part to silicon and
nitrogen. Furthermore, the silicon nitride article will
react with the carbon in the graphite to form silicon
carbide, which is thermodynamically stable at
temperatures above 1700°C, causing warping of the silicon
nitride article. In contrast, when setter powder is
used, the powder itself decomposes due to the high
temperature in the furnace and the powder reacts
preferentially with the furnace material instead of the
silicon nitride article.For economical reasons and optimum product
quality, it is highly desirable to prepare sintered
silicon nitride in a continuous process. Although 
silicon nitride could be sintered in continuous furnaces
using setter powder in the above-described method, this
method has been found to be undesirable. Firstly, the
setter powder must be cleaned off the article after
sintering, adding a step in the procedure. At times, the
powder on a silicon nitride article sinters together or
sinters to the article, thus, requiring excessive force
to remove the sintered material. In some of these
instances, the sintered setter powder cannot be removed
even with force, and the article must be scrapped.In addition, use of the setter powder is
costly, as recycling of the setter powder is not without
its problems. During use, there is inherent loss of
setter powder (due to spillage, etc.). It has been known
to lose as much powder in weight as the silicon nitride
article itself. Furthermore, during recycling, often the
setter powder needs to be crushed and screened to break-up
the sintered pieces before reusing, adding yet another
step in the manufacturing procedure.Yttria or other densification agents are
sometimes added to the setter

A method for converting silicon into beta-phase
silicon nitride, the method comprising the steps of


heating a walled container (10) enclosing silicon
while traversing through a furnace (60) having an initial

vestibule entrance including an entrance door and an exit
door, the furnace also having first, second, and third

heated zones having pressures above atmospheric pressure,
the walled container (10)

temperatures of at least 1700°C, and the walled container

the silicon therein;
opening the entrance door of the initial vestibule

through the opened entrance door, closing the entrance
door and thereafter evacuating the atmosphere in the

vestibule entrance to a pressure of 10

from hydrogen and nitrogen, opening the exit door of the
vestibule entrance and transferring the silicon from the

vestibule entrance through the open exit door of the
vestibule entrance and into the first heated zone having

a hydrogen atmosphere and a temperature up to 1000°C for
burning off organic additives in the silicon to form

burned-off silicon;

burned-off silicon while traversing through the second

heated zone having a temperature from 1350 to 1450°C and
