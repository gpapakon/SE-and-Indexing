<ABSTRACT>
A blow molded plastic container including at least one 
internal supporting member (50,50A,50B,83,84,85) integral with 

the inside wall face of the body portion to support same. In one 
embodiment, the body portion defines lobes (60,60A',60A'',60B) connected 

together by depressions (61,61A,61B) which define a handgrip, wherein the 
depressions are supported by the internal supporting member. 

In another embodiment, an axially, inwardly directed part (82) is 
supported by the supporting member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a blow molded plastic container 
according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a container is known from US-A-4,993,565. In this 
container the depressions forming a handgrip are reinforced 
against inward buckling by integral grooves and/or 
ribs. The object of the present invention has to be seen in the 
provision of an alternative way of reinforcing the 
depressions in order to prevent the depressions from 
buckling outwardly when the container is pressurized. This object is solved by the features in the characterizing 
clause of claim 1. According to WO-A-90/05674 blow molded plastic containers 
are known which are polygonal in cross section and which 
are provided with a spider extending substantially the 
whole length within the bottle from its neck portion over 
the shoulder and body portions to its bottom portion so 
that the plastic bottle can be formed with shapes that are 
polygonal in section for packaging purposes. These bottles 
do not have depressions in the body portion which form a 
handgrip. Further advantages features of the bottle according to the 
invention are stated in the subclaims.  
 After all, the container of the present invention provides 
numerous advantages. Firstly, a blow molded plastic 
container is provided with a supporting member inside the 
container providing support therefor. Supported handgrips 
may readily be obtained, and a bottom portion may be 
provided with internal supporting members providing support 
for an axially, inwardly directed bottom part. Further, 
these containers are conveniently and readily prepared. Further advantages of the present invention will appear 
hereinbelow. The foregoing will be more readily apparent when 
considered in connection with the following illustrative 
drawings wherein: 
Figure 1 is a side-sectional view of a preform for 
preparing a container of the present invention; Figure 1A is a sectional view taken along lines 1A-1A 
of Figure 1; Figure 2A is a partial perspective view of a core for 
forming the preform of Figure 1;  
 Figure 2B is a sectional view of a core-injection mold 
assembly for forming the preform of Figure 1; Figure 3 is an elevational view of a container of the 
present invention; Figure 4 is a partial sectional view taken through a 
blow mold for forming a container of the present invention 
from a preform similar to the preform of Figure 1; Figure 5A is a cross-sectional view taken along lines 
5A-5A of Figure 3; Figure 5B is a variation of the embodiment of Figure 
5A; Figure 5C

<CLAIMS>
A blow molded plastic container including a handgrip 
comprising: 


a neck portion (41) defining an opening (42), a 
bottom portion (43), a body portion (44) and a 

shoulder portion (47), interconnecting said neck and 
body portions;
 
wherein said neck, body, shoulder and bottom portions 

define a hollow space (51) closed at the bottom 
portion (43) and open at the neck portion (41);
 
wherein the body portion outside wall face (49A) 

defines regions that comprise at least two molded 
depressions dividing said body portion (44) into at 

least two adjoining molded lobes (60), with the 
depressions and lobes being limited in extent to the 

body portion (44) only and forming a handgrip,
characterized in
 
that said depressions (61) are interconnected and 

supported by a supporting member (50) to prevent 
outward bulging of the depressions, wherein said 

supporting member (50) extends completely across the 
hollow space (51) and is integral with the inside 

wall face (48A) of the body portion (44). 
A container according to claim 1 wherein the 
supporting member (50) extends from the bottom 

portion (43) to the body portion (44) and is integral 
with both the bottom and body portions.  

 
A container according to claim 1 or 2 including four 
of said adjoining lobes (68), and four of said 

depressions (61), and two of said supporting members 
(50) comprising internal supporting walls extending 

completely across said hollow space (51), with each 
supporting wall interconnecting two of said 

depressions (61). 
A container according to claim 3 wherein said lobes 
(60) are of approximately the same size and wherein 

said supporting member (50) approximately crosses the 
center of said hollow space (51). 
A container according to claim 1 wherein said lobes 
(60A', 60A'') are of uneq
ual size and wherein said 
supporting member (50A) crosses the hollow space (51) 

spaced from the center thereof. 
A container according to claim 2 wherein the bottom 
portion includes an axially, inwardly directed part 

(72) having an inside wall face, and wherein said 
supporting member (50) is integral with at least part 

of the body portion (44) inside wall face and is also 
integral with the inwardly directed part inside wall 

face, to support said integral inside wall faces. 
A container according to claim 6 including a 
plurality of said supporting members (83, 84, 85). 
A container according to one of the preceding claims 
wherein said container is expanded from a preform 

(10) in a blow mold (30) and said supporting member 
(50) is expanded to the extent permitted by the blow 

mold.
