<ABSTRACT>
In the working method according to the invention, the dressing of the cutting knives is effected by grinding them in the state in which they are fitted in the knife rotor. For this purpose, firstly all of the knives are successively advanced into their active region by an amount corresponding to the cutting-edge wear, the radial grinding advance necessary for obtaining the desired cutting-edge projection beyond the relevant surface of the knife rotor being preprogrammed, taking account of the state of wear of said surface, which is ascertained by feeling. To carry out this working method, use may also be made of a device in which, on a machine frame 1, there is mounted a rotary disc 7 for the knife rotor 8 and there is arranged an apparatus table 2 which carries a grinding unit 17, movable crosswise in translatory fashion, as well as a radially movable adjusting device 28, having a feeler for detecting the state of wear of the relevant surface of the knife rotor 8 and a stop for limiting the knife advance.

A method to resharpen knives of size reduction 
machines, particularly flaking knives, arranged and 

fastened in cylindrical mounting supports with 
releasable clamps in such a manner that during the 

operational process the knife edges form a common 
circle, characterized by sharpening the knives by way 

of grinding the edges of the knives while the knives 
are in an installed state fastened in the mounting 

support while rotating the knife mounting support at 
low speed at which before sharpening all the knives 

are loosened one after another in the mounting 
support, after which they are advanced towards a 

functional position by an amount relative to the wear 
of the knife edges, then they are again tightly 

clamped in this position, at which in order to achieve 
a desired protrusion of the edges relative to the 

relevant area in the mounting support the required 
radial grinding feed is preprogrammed by considering 

the state of wear of this relevant area.  
 
A method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in 
such a manner that the state of wear of the relevant 

area of the knife mounting support required for the 
preprogramming of the radial grinding feed is sensed 

while the knives are individually advanced and an 
average value is established. 
A method in accordance with claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that before and after sharpening the 

knives and the mounting support are cleaned by 
applying
 a medium under pressure. 
A method in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the grinding operation occurs 

while a cooling agent is applied. 
A method in accordance with claim 1 to 4, characterized 
in that for the purpose of resharpening the 

knife mounting support is taken out from the size 
reduction machine and is handled in a special 

sharpening device.  
 
A device for implementing the method of claim 5, 
especially for the resharpening of knives fastened on 

a knife rim, characterized by a machine frame (1) 
having a rotational disc (7) for engaging the knife 

rim (8), a translatory moveable grinding unit (17) and 
an adjustment unit (28) for uniformly advancing the 

knives (32) over the cylindrical inner wall (8'') of 
the knife rim (8) commensurate with the wear on the 

edges. 
A device in accordance with claim 6, characterized in 
that the grinding unit (17) includes a rotational 

grinding disc (18) which support (21) is moveable in 
axial as well as in radial direction on a sliding 

cross carriage (22,23), the adjustment unit for the 
uniform knife protrusion comprising a tamping tool 

(39) acting on the back sides of the knives and a stop 
face (29) for limiting the advance of the knives. 
A device in accordance with claim 7, characterized in 
that a position sensor (30) is assigned to the stop 

face (29) to capture the state of wear of the inner 
wall (8'') of the knife rim.  

 
A device in accordance with claim 8, characterized in 
that the position sensor (30) is integrated into an 

electronic control device which programs the radial 
feed of the grinding unit (17) needed to achieve the 

desired protrusion of the knife edges based on the 
state of wear of the inner wall of the knife rim 

(8''). 
A device in accordance with claims 5 to 9, 
characterized in that the adjustment unit for 

advancing the knives consists of a tool combination 
(34) which comprises a spindle (36) for the self-acting 

loosening of the releasable clamps (15) and a 
hold down device (40) that acts upon the knife holding 

plate (38). 
A device in accordance with claim 10, characterized in 
that the sequence of functional operations of the tool 

combination (35) is controlled by an automatic 
sequence control device.
