<ABSTRACT>
A forward/backward printing thermal printer 
which brings a printing paper onto a printing member and 

performs a printing action in order to form an image. The 
printer comprises a thermal head which transfers the image 

onto the paper according to an image signal, a platen roller 
which moves the paper back and forth when it rotates, and a 

pair of paper pressing means which press the paper on the 
platen roller and cause it to move back and forth with the 

roller. When the paper moves and is no longer held on one 
side by a paper pressing means, the paper pressing means on 

the side where the paper has been released is moved on the 
outer circumference of the platen roller by a fan-shaped 

gear rotated by a drive gear so as to again grip the edge of 
the paper which is carried to the position of the other 

paper pressing means. In this way, the effective printing 
range on the paper is enlarged without any error
 in the 
paper's position or color due to the transport mechanism. 

The printer can also be made compact.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method according to the pre-characterizing
part of claim 1, and to a forward/backward printing thermal
printer for performing this method.In a conventional thermal printer, a paper guided to
a printing member while being gripped between a platen
roller and pinch roller, and an ink sheet of a predetermined
color guided to a thermal head by a different path to that
of the paper, are superposed. Ink on the ink sheet is then
transferred to the paper by the thermal head which is heated
according to input image data. After printing with a first
color ink sheet is complete, the colored ink sheet is discharged,
and the paper alone is moved back to the position
at which printing was begun. A second color ink sheet is
then supplied, and image transfer performed using this
second color ink sheet. The same paper is moved back and
forth and the ink sheet is changed so that by superposing
predetermined colors according to image data (usually, 
yellow, magenta, cyan and if necessary black), a color
image composed of desired colors is formed.Fig. 1 is a schematic view of, for example, the
printing parts of a conventional thermal printer as is
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Tokkai Sho 64-42263.
This color thermal printer comprises a thermal head 12 which
heats, according to input image data, ink on an ink sheet 10
consisting of a PET film or the like coated on one side with
a thermofusible ink so that the ink melts and is transferred
to a paper 11, a platen roller 13 which moves the paper 11
and ink sheet 10 on a printing member of the thermal head
12, a supply side pinch roller 14 which transports the paper
11 while pressing it on the platen roller 13, and a discharge
side pinch roller 15. The paper 11 is firmly gripped between
the platen roller 13 and the pinch rollers 14, 15 so
that even if the paper 11 is moved forwards and backwards in
order to perform printing by superposition, positional
errors due to paper transport are avoided and color errors
are prevented.The action of a color thermal printer having this
construction will now be described with reference to Fig. 2.
As shown in Fig. 2A, the supply paper 11 is guided between
the platen roller 13 and the supply side pinch roller 14 to
the thermal head 12 or to a previously supplied ink sheet
10, and then passes between the platen roller 13 and discharge
side pinch roller 15. An action referred to as 
blank feed is then performed. In this action, after the
paper has been sent to the position shown in Fig. 2B, it
returns to the
