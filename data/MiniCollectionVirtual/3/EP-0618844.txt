<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a
method for comminuting and dehydrating a variety of
materials and, in particular, to an apparatus and method
which produce comminuted and dehydrated materials by
cyclonic pressure gradients through cochleated air-flow
patterns.Numerous types of apparatuses and methods have been
utilized to comminute materials having a variety of sizes,
shapes, and physical characteristics, such as grains, ores,
etc. Unfortunately, many of those apparatuses exhibited
poor wearing characteristics and high maintenance problems,
excessive noise generation, and high energy source
requirements.Similarly, numerous types of apparatuses and methods
have been utilized to dehydrate various materials. Many of
these apparatuses, in addition to many of the problems
observed for the comminuters as aforesaid, exhibited heat
generation and time consumption problems.Various apparatuses have been developed in an attempt
to utilize a destructive cyclonic environment for
comminuting certain materials. For example, U. S. Pat. No.
4,390,131 discloses a method and apparatus for comminuting
material, which utilizes three blowers: one for blowing 
air longitudinally into an inlet chamber and a
frustoconical chamber, another for blowing air tangentially
into a cylindrical chamber, and a third for assisting with
discharging air entrained with the comminuted material.
Unfortunately, all three blowers of this apparatus
apparently must be simultaneously adjusted to select the
desired throughput rate and coarseness of comminuted
material.What is needed is an apparatus and method which
reliably and controllably harnesses the geostrophic
relationship between air-flow velocity, pressure-gradient
forces, and coriolis force, which are naturally present in
the destructive, cyclonic environment of a tornado or
cyclone, for practical purposes. Properly used, such
destructive cyclonic forces can be harnessed for
simultaneously comminuting or fractionating and dehydrating
materials having a variety of sizes and physical
characteristics and which utilizes the force of gravity
such that a controlled cyclonic environment can be
maintained by only one blower, thereby eliminating the
complicated, inter-related adjustments normally required
when using a plurality of blowers.An improved comminuter/dehydrator apparatus and method
are provided for comminuting and dehydrating a variety of
materials having widely ranging sizes and physical
characteristics. The apparatus includes a cylindrically shaped chamber
having a
