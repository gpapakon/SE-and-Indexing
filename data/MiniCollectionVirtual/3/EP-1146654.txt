<ABSTRACT>
A communication device for a mobile unit designed to save
power without inviting a deterioration in communication

performance. In the communication device for performing radio
communication by a frame unit having a plurality of

transmission blocks each of which comprises a transmission
information portion and a control data portion relative to the

transmission information portion, the communication device
includes a transmission level adjusting part for adjusting the

respective transmission levels of the transmission information
portion and the control data portion so as to make them differ

from each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication device
for a mobile unit, such as a portable telephone.In a communication device, such as a portable
telephone, for a mobile unit, a battery used as a power
supply is housed for carrying the communication device or
mounting the device in a vehicle, and, in order to control
the power consumption by the battery, the communication
device is expected to save power. However, deterioration in
communication performance, such as the cutoff of a
conversation on the telephone, which is brought about by a
reduction in power consumption of the device must be avoided.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a communication device for a mobile unit designed to
save power without inviting a deterioration in communication
performance.The present invention is characterized in that, in a
communication device for a mobile unit for performing radio
communication by a frame unit having a plurality of
transmission blocks each of which comprises a transmission
information portion and a control data portion relative to
the transmission information portion, the communication
device includes a transmission level adjusting part for 
adjusting the respective transmission levels of the
transmission information portion and the control data
portion so as to make them differ from each other.Further more, the present invention is characterized in
that, in a communication device for a mobile unit for
performing radio communication by a frame unit capable of
constructing a plurality of transmission blocks each of which
comprises digital data having transmission information in
one part thereof, the communication device includes a
transmission level adjusting part for adjusting the
transmission level of the digital data necessary for bit
synchronization capture when the transmission block is
received so as to become greater than the transmission level
of the transmission information.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the structure of an
embodiment of a transmitting circuit of the communication
device for a mobile unit of the present invention;Fig. 2 is a diagram showing a communication method
according to the TDMA system;Fig. 3 a diagram showing the structure of each channel
and the upper and lower limits of an envelope waveform of a
transmission signal;Fig. 4 is a flowchart showing the operation of a
microcomputer of Fig. 1;Fig. 5 is a diagram showing a change in transmission
