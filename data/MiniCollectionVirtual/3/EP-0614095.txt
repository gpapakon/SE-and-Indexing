<ABSTRACT>
Dipole detection and localization systems and methods employing improved 
processing techniques. The first processing technique (30) provides for higher spatial 

resolution by implementing maximum likelihood beamforming processing to detect and 
locate a dipole (13) in a manner analogous to the processing of wave propagation phenomena. 

The high resolution technique (30) is comprised of using data derived from 
an array of magnetic sensors (11) that is arranged in the form of a vector of coefficients 

in lieu of a matrix. This vector can be either the magnetic field components or the 
Anderson function expansion coefficients and is used to form a dyadic matrix (35), to 

which a multiple of an identity matrix (37) is added to prevent singularity. The second 
improvement (30a) uses more than three Anderson function expansions (34a) to 

achieve detection and localization of the dipole (13). The use of more than three Anderson 
functions (34a) more effectively normalizes out the noise dependence by providing 

better noise representations, and provides for detection and localization of multipoles. 
The third improvement (50) provides for multiple-pass multiple-target processing of 

data measured by the array of sensors (11). First, the location of the largest dipole 
(13a) in the field-space of the array is determined, and its moment and orientation are 

determined. The field due to the dipole (13a) at that location and orientation is then 
removed (42) from the measurement data and the process is repeated. The field is 

removed by subtracting out (42) its contribution at each of the sensors (11) in the array, 
and then estimating the location of the next largest dipole (13b). Simulations have 

shown that this process (50) provides the ability to resolve multiple dipoles, when 
applied as many times as is needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to dipole
detection and location processing,
that provides for higher
spatial resolution, that provides for the use of more than
three Anderson functions in the Anderson function
expansions, and for the use of multiple processing of data
and subtractions to achieve multiple target resolution.Prior art methods and apparatus for detection and
location processing of magnetic dipoles are known from EP-A-0503384,
US-A-4710708 and IEEE Transactions on Geoscience
and Remote Sensing, March 1990, pp. 182 to 193.The improvements provided by the present invention
relate to the dipole moment detection and localization
invention described in copending U.S. patent application
serial No. 07/616,158 (now US-A-5239474 published 24/08/93 ; EP-A-0 621 493 published 26/10/94), filed November 20,
1990, which is assigned to the assignee of the present
invention. The dipole moment detection and localization
described in this application provides for an improved
method of processing multiple field sensors in a dipole
field than any method previously used. In this dipole
moment detection and localization system, detection and
localization is accomplished using the outputs from a fixed
vector- or total-field-magnetometer array. The dipole
moment detection and localization described in this patent
application has yielded dramatic performance improvement
over existing magnetic anomaly detection systems that use a
single sensor to detect a change in the total local magnetic
field derived from a dipole.Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention
to provide for dipole moment detection and localization
processing method that provide for higher
resolution of dipoles, the use of higher order Anderson
functions in order to provide for better detection and
localization of multiple dipoles, and processing techniques
that also provide for the detection and localization of 
multiple target detection within the field of the sensors by
field substraction techniques.In order to improve the processing capabilities of the
invention disclosed in the above-identified patent
application, the present invention provides for an improved
dipole detection and localization
method that employs a processing technique that improves
various aspects of this detection and localization system.The processing method according to the present
invention, which is defined in claim 1 hereinafter, provides
for higher spatial resolution by extending the capabilities
of the dipole moment detection and localization
