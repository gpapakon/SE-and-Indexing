<ABSTRACT>
A radio pager capable of displaying a message 
implemented as a fixed sentence has a radio section for 

receiving and demodulating a paging signal, a first storage 
storing a plurality of address numbers allocated to the pager, 

a comparing section for comparing an address number 
included in the demodulated paging signal with each of the 

address numbers stored in the first storage, and outputing, if 
the former is identical with any one of the latter, the former 

as an address number assigned to the pager while writing 
message data following the address number in a message 

memory, a second storage storing a plurality of tables each 
listing a particular kind of fixed sentences, a third storage 

storing correspondence between the address numbers 
allocated to the pager and the tables, a message processing 

section for selecting based on the stored correspondence, one 
of the tables corresponding to the address number assigned to 

the pager, and selecting one of the fixed sentences 
corresponding to the message data written to the message  

 
memory on the basis of stored correspondence, and a display 

section for displaying the fixed sentence selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio pager and, more
particularly, to a radio pager capable of displaying messages
implemented as fixed sentences.Radio pagers available today include one storing a
plurality of address numbers assigned thereto and capable of
displaying fixed sentences. This type of pager stores fixed
sentences and sentence numbers corresponding one-to-one to
the fixed sentences. As an operator at a calling station
enters the address number of a particular receiver and then a
number representative of a desired sentence, the receiver
displays a fixed sentence corresponding to the sentence
number which follows the address number. The sentence
number, which is a numeral or numerals, allows a message in,
for example, Japanese karakana to be transferred from the
calling station to the receiver. Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication No. 2-127825, for example, discloses a radio
pager having a liquid crystal display which flashes or
reverses black and white for each of the plurality of address
numbers. The conventional pager of the type described can select
any one of the fixed sentences registered thereat without
regard to the address number used to send a message to the
user. All the sentences registered at the pager are candidates
for message display. However, such a pager is apt to display
an unexpected fixed sentence due to, for example, an incorrect
sentence number inadvertently entered at the calling station
and propagation troubles, e.g., wave interference and fading.
For example, it is likely that "Charge is unpaid", which is an
exclusive fixed message to be sent by the operator to a user,
is sent by accident.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide a radio pager capable of limiting, on receiving one of
a plurality of address numbers, the kind of fixed sentences
which can be displayed.A radio pager capable of displaying a message
implemented as a fixed sentence of the present invention
comprises a radio section for receiving and demodulating a
paging signal, a first storage storing a plurality of address
numbers allocated to the pager, a comparing section for
comparing an address number included in the demodulated
paging signal with each of the address numbers stored in the
first storage, and outputing, if the former is identical with 
any one of the latter, the former as an address number
assigned to the pager while writing message data following
the address number in a message memory, a second storage
storing a plurality of tables each listing a particular

<CLAIMS>
A radio pager capable of displaying a fixed sentence,
comprising:


a radio section for receiving and demodulating a paging
signal;
a first storage storing a plurality of address numbers
allocated to said radio pager;
a comparing section for comparing an address number
included in the paging signal demodulated by said radio

section with each of the plurality of address numbers stored
in said first storage, and outputing, if said address number of

said paging signal is identical with any one of said plurality
of address numbers, said address number as an address

number assigned to said radio pager while writing message
data following said address number in a message memory;
a second storage storing a plurality of tables each
listing a particular kind of fixed sentences;
a third storage storing correspondence between the
plurality of address numbers allocated to said radio pager and

said plurality of tables;
a message processing section for selecting, based on
said correspondence stored in said third storage, one of said

plurality of tables corresponding to said address number
assigned to said radio pager, and selecting one of said fixed 

sentences corresponding to the message data written to said
message memory on the basis of said correspondence; and
a display section for displaying the fixed sentence
selected by said message processing section.
A radio pager as claimed in claim 1, wherein said

message processing section, said second storage, and a driver
included in said display section for driving a display are

configured as a single chip.
A radio pager as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
first storage and said third storage comprise a single EEPROM.
A radio pager as claimed in claim 3, wherein said
second storage comprises a single ROM.
A radio pager as claimed in claim 4, wherein said
message processing section comprises an MPU, a decoder, and

a RAM.
