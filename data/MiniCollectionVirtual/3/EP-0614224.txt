<ABSTRACT>
A gate array comprised of basic cells is disclosed. Each 
cell in the gate array includes a silicide-clad diffused region 

isolated from the source/drain regions of the transistors in the 
cell. Metal connections are made to the silicide-clad diffused 

region periodically along its length, so that the silicide-clad 
diffused region distributes the power supply voltage to the 

cells without requiring overlying metallization which limits 
routing flexibility. A CMOS implementation is illustrated, in 

which silicide-clad diffused regions of both types are provided 
in each cell. Connection of the power supply voltage to the 

silicide-clad diffused regions also serves as well bias 
connections, to avoid latchup and leakage conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of integrated circuits, 
and is more specifically directed to gate array basic cells. This application is related to European Patent 
Application No 94300652.8 the contents of which are 
incorporated herein by this cross reference. In the field of electronic systems, the use of gate arrays 
to implement digital functions has become widespread in recent 
years. As is well known in the art, a gate array is an 
integrated circuit fabricated as a regular arrangement of 
transistors, which can be interconnected according to the 
desired digital function. The transistors are conventionally 
grouped into "basic cells", rather than as individual 
transistors, with each basic cell comprising a sufficient number 
of transistors to implement an elemental logic function (i.e., 
a "gate"). A basic cell (often also referred to as a "base 
cell", "basic block", or "functional block") corresponds to a 
step-and-repeat silicon structure, from which a circuit function 
is realized by the routing of overlying metal or other 
conductive elements. The use of gate arrays allows for the rapid production of 
customized digital circuits. This results from the fabrication  
 
of integrated circuit wafers with the transistors in the basic 
cells defined by lower level physical elements, but with the 
actual digital circuit function not defined until later stages 
in the manufacturing process. In the case of MOS gate arrays, 
the basic cell transistors are defined by source and drain 
diffusions and first level polysilicon gate electrodes. Metal 
interconnections are then defined to interconnect the transistor 
elements according to the desired circuit function. This 
process allows the customized arrangement of the gates, or 
cells, to be implemented at the latest stages in the 
manufacturing process, reducing the design-to-manufacture time 
of the digital circuit. Custom integrated circuits may thus be 
produced at very short cycle times, and with a minimum number of 
custom photomasks. The cost of gate array implementations, as is the case with 
other integrated circuits, depends upon the amount of 
semiconductor area used to implement the function, and also upon 
the complexity of the manufacturing process. An important 
element of gate array design includes the distribution of power 
supply voltages to the transistors in those cells used in the 
circuit implementation. The power supply lines, for example Vdd 
and Vss power supply lines, must of course not contact one 
another nor contact signal
