<ABSTRACT>
Snow shoe comprising a principal frame (2) consisting at least of one peripheral wall (3) delimiting an inner zone or grid (screen) (4) comprising a set of internal walls intended to bear on the snow and support the user's boot, the lower border (30) of the peripheral wall (3) defining a first attachment plane (P1), characterised in that the central part of the grid (4) comprises at least one internal attachment wall (23, 24), the lower border (230, 240) of which projects under the said first plane (P1).

<CLAIMS>
Snow shoe comprising a fastening arrangement (5) formed
by an articulated plate (10) and holding means (11, 12),

said fastening arrangement being articulated in relation
to a mesh (4) defined by a peripheral wall (3) of a main

frame (2), said mesh (4) being constructed in the form of
a perforated plate comprising an assembly of internal

walls provided for support on the snow and for supporting
the fastening arrangement (5) and the boot (6) of the

user, the lower edge (30) of the peripheral wall (3)
defining a first plane of engagement (P1), characterised

in that the central section (40) of the mesh (4)
comprises at least one internal engagement wall (21, 22,

23, 24, 21', 22', 23', 24'), the lower edge (210, 220, 230,
240, 210', 220', 230', 240') of which projects below said

first plane (P1).
Snow shoe according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
internal engagement wall (21, 22) is disposed

transversely in the zone occupied by the boot.
Snow shoe according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
internal engagement wall (21, 210) is a front transverse

wall disposed in the toe region of the boot.
Snow shoe according to Claim 1, characterised in that it
comprises two internal engagement walls (23-24, 23'-24')

extending longitudinally on both sides of the plane (P)
of general symmetry of the snow shoe.
Snow shoe according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
two internal lateral engagement walls (23-24, 23'-24') are

essentially parallel. 
Snow shoe according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
two internal lateral engagement walls (23'-24') converge

towards the front (AV).
Snow shoe according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
two internal lateral engagement walls (23-24) converge

towards the rear (AR).
Snow shoe according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the lower surface (9) of the mesh

forms a second plane (P2) set back above the first plane
(P1).
Snow shoe according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the central section of the mesh (4)

comprises a secondary frame formed by four engagement
walls (21, 22, 23, 24), the lower edge (210, 220, 230,

240) of which projects below the first plane (P1) to form
a third plane (P3) located below said first plane (P1).
Snow shoe according to Claim 9, characterised in that the
height (H1) of the peripheral wall (3) is less than the

height (H2) of the internal engagement wall or walls (21,
22, 23, 24, 21', 22', 23', 24').
Snow shoe according to Claim 10, characterised in that
the height (h) of the walls of the mesh is less than the

height (H1) of the peripheral wall of the frame.
