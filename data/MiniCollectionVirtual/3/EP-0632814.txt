<ABSTRACT>
High molecular weight surface proteins of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae which exhibit immunogenic properties and genes encoding the same are described. Specifically, genes coding for two immunodominant high molecular weight proteins, HMW1 and HMW2, have been cloned, expressed and sequenced, while genes coding for high molecular proteins HMW3 and HMW4 have been cloned, expressed and partially sequenced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high molecular weight
proteins of non-typeable haemophilus.Non-typeable Haemophilusinfluenzae are non-encapsulated
organisms that are defined by their lack of
reactivity with antisera against known H. influenzae
capsular antigens.These organisms commonly inhabit the upper
respiratory tract of humans and are frequently
responsible for infections, such as otitis media,
sinusitis, conjunctivitis, bronchitis and pneumonia.
Since these organisms do not have a polysaccharide
capsule, they are not controlled by the present
Haemophilusinfluenzae type b (Hib) vaccines, which are
directed towards Hib bacterial capsular polysaccharides.
The non-typeable strains, however, do produce surface
antigens that can elicit bactericidal antibodies. Two of
the major outer membrane proteins, P2 and P6, have been
identified as targets of human serum bactericidal
activity. However, it has been shown that the P2 protein
sequence is variable, in particular in the non-typeable
Haemophilus strains. Thus, a P2-based vaccine would not
protect against all strains of the organism.__ There have previously been identified by Barenkamp
et al (Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J., 9:333-339, 1990) a group
of high-molecular-weight (HMW) proteins that appeared to
be major targets of antibodies present in human
convalescent sera. Examination of a series of middle ear
isolates revealed the presence of one or two such
proteins in most strains. However, prior to the present
invention, the structures of these proteins were unknown
as were pure isolates of such proteins. Thomas et al in "Infection and Immunity" 1990, 58(6),
1909-1913 described an E. coli clone producing a high
molecular weight surface antigen of Hib, but the amino acid
sequence of the antigen is not given. Its molecular weight
is given as about 103,000.Barenkamp in "Pediatric Research" 1991, 29(4), 167(A),
No. 985 described having cloned and expressed genes for 120
and 125 kDa surface exposed outer membrane proteins of non-typeable
Haemophilus influenzae but provided no sequence
information. A similar disclosure appeared in "Pediatric
Research" 1990, 27(4), 166A, No. 983 and also in "Abstracts
of the 31st Interscience Conference on antimicrobial agents
and chemistry", 1991, 31, 286, No. 1126.The inventors, in an effort to further characterise the
high molecular weight (HMW) Haemophilus proteins, have
cloned, expressed and sequenced the genes coding for two
immunodominant HMW proteins (designated HMW1 and HMW2) from a
prototype non-typeable Haemophilus strain and have
