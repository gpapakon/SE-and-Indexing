<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for providing displays in which the locations of nodes of a graph relative 
to each other are a function of the significance of a relationship between the nodes. 

The technique used to locate the nodes produces groups of nodes with significant 
relationships to each other which are set visually apart from the other nodes. The 

relationships between the nodes are defined by using a statistic to give weights to 
links between the nodes. Statistics may also be used to determine the size, shape, 

and color of the nodes and the color and width of the links. The display may also 
include histograms which show the numbers of links or nodes which have given 

values of the statistics and which relate the colors in which the nodes and links are 
displayed to values of the statistics. The histograms may further be used to 

interactively define masks for links and nodes, and masked links and nodes are not 
taken into account in making the display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the graphical display of information 
and more particularly to the graphical display of information which can be 
represented as a graph consisting of nodes and edges. Graphs made up of nodes and edges have long been used to represent 
entities and a relationship between them. For example, a telephone call from a caller 
to a callee may be represented by two nodes, one representing the caller and the 
other the callee, and an edge which connects the nodes and represents the call. With the advent of digital computer systems with sufficient power to 
drive large high-resolution displays, graphs began to be used to visually represent 
information accessible to the computer system on displays. Moreover, users of the 
computer systems could use input devices such as a mouse or a keyboard to interact 
with the displayed graphs. In many cases, the input device could move a pointer in 
the display, and the interaction with the graphs depended on the location of the 
pointer in the display. One example of an interactive display system which employs graphs is 
the system disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,136,690, Becker et al., Dynamic Graphical 
Analysis of Network Data, issued August 4, 1992. FIG. 6 herein is FIG. 2 of that 
patent. As shown in FIG. 6, the display of that system has a map 600 of the 
continental United States upon which nodes are displayed which represent AT&T's 
switching centers. The edges connecting the nodes represent various statistics 
concerning the flow of traffic between the nodes. In FIG. 6, edge 603 can be seen 
connecting nodes 601 and 602. The edges in the figure represent blocked calls 
between the nodes. FIG. 6 shows blocked calls immediately after a serious 
earthquake in California. As is immediately apparent from FIG. 6, a major problem of displays 
like those of FIG. 6 is clutter, that is, the tendency of the display to become 
unreadable as the amount of data it displays increases. Thus, in FIG. 6, the sheer 
volume of blocked calls results in so many edges 603 in the display that large  
 
portions of the display are hidden and individual edges cannot be distinguished. 
Another example of the same problem may be found in Michael F. Schwartz and 
David C.M. Wood, "Discovering Shared Interests using Graph Analysis", in: 
Communications of the ACM, Vol. 36, no. 8, August 1993, pp. 78-89. See in 
particular Fig. 3. To deal with the problem of clutter, Becker's system includes controls 
which permit the user to interactively modify the display to

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for representing information which describes relationships 
between entities in a display in a computer system, the apparatus comprising: 

   an area in the display for displaying a plurality of entity representations, 
each entity representation corresponding to one of the entities; and 

   means responsive to the information for arranging entity representations 
of entities whose relationships with each other are more significant than their 

relationships with others of the entity representations into groups in the area which 
are set visually apart from the others of the entity representations.
