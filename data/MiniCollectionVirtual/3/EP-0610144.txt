<ABSTRACT>
Method for winding (or spooling) a yarn (2) on a textile machine including a supply (3) and one or more call systems (4, 5) for the yarn as well as a winding system (6). According to the invention, the drive of the call system or systems (4, 5) is provided by means of a motor (8) associated with a frequency converter (9), each motor (7) driving the receiving support (6) being associated with a frequency converter (10). A tension detector (11) measures the tension of each yarn (2) and regulates the speed of rotation of the receiving spool automatically as a function of the tension detected.

A process for the winding (or spooling) of a thread (2) on a textile 
machine capable of comprising a large number of identical work stations 

arranged side by side, each work station comprising at least, in the 
direction of the path of the thread : 


a feed (3) for the thread (2) to be treated ; 
at least one draw-off system (4), making it possible to deliver the 
thread (2) at a predetermined speed ; 
a system (6) for winding the thread (2) around a support driven in 
rotation by an electric motor (7) and comprising a thread-guide assembly 

(18) driven in a to-and-fro movement, dispensing the thread (2) along a 
generatrix of the receiving support, in order to carry out the construction 

of the actual spool, 
characterized
 in that : 
the drive of the draw-off system (4) is effected by means of a motor 
(8) associated with a frequency converter (9) ; 
the motor (7) effecting the drive of the receiving support (6) is 
likewise associated with a frequency converter (10) and ; 
a tension detector (11) measures the tension of the thread (2) 
between the receiving system (6) and the draw-off system (4) and 

transmits a signal to the frequency converter (10) associated with the 
motor (7) of the winding system (6) driving the thread-receiving support 

in rotation, said signal being such that, if the tension of the thread is 
higher than a preset threshold, the rotational speed of the receiving 

support is reduced automatically, whilst, if the tension is lower than a 
preset threshold, the rotational speed of the receiving support is 

increased, thus making it possible to obtain not only a constant tension of 
the thread, but also a constant linear winding speed. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the draw-off 
system (4) is preceded by a second preliminary draw-off system (5), an 

additional treatment being carried out on the moving thread between 
these two draw-off systems (4,5). 
The process as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the 
additional treatment carried out between the two draw-off systems (4,5) 

consists of a drafting of the thread. 
The process as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the 
additional treatment carried out between the two draw-off systems (4,5) us 

a heat treatment. 
The process as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the 
additional treatment carried out between the two draw-off systems (4,5) is 

a texturing treatment, particularly by false twisting. 
A textile machine carrying out the winding process as claimed in 
one of claims 1 to 5.
