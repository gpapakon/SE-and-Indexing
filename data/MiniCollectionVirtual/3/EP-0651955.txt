<ABSTRACT>
The brush (1) for application of nail varnish or similar product includes bristles (3, 4) forming a tuft (2) which is obtained from a bundle of substantially parallel bristles folded in two halfway along their length, the bristles being fastened to the end of a wand (5) by engagement, with gripping, of the folded part (8) of the tuft of bristles in a housing (9) opening up at the end of the wand. The bristles (3, 4) have sections accepting a circumscribed circle of constant diameter and are chosen from at least two groups, the bristles (3) of one group being arranged so as to have a mechanical behaviour on flexing which is different from that of the bristles (4) of the other group so that, during folding and gripping of the different groups of bristles, these groups give a ventilated and spread-out brush tuft (2), with relatively large spaces between bristles which favour good capillarity for varnishes, the viscosity of which may vary over a wide range.

Brush for the application of nail varnish, or
of a similar product, which includes bristles forming a

tuft (2) obtained from a bundle (7) of bristles which
are substantially parallel, which are folded in two

approximately halfway along their length, the bristles
being fixed at the end of a rod (5) by engagement, with

clamping, of the folded part (8) of the bristle tuft in
a housing (9) opening at the end of the rod (5), the

bristles having cross-sections admitting a
circumscribed circle (C) of the same diameter,

characterized in that the bristles (3, 4) of the tuft
(2) are chosen from at least two groups, the bristles

(3) of one group being arranged to have a different
mechanical behaviour in flexure from that of the

bristles (4) of the other group so that, during bending
and clamping of the various groups of bristles, these

groups give a brush tuft (2) which is open to the air
and spread out, favourable to good capillary action for

varnishes whose viscosity may vary over a wide range.
Brush according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the bristles (3) of one group are made of a

different material from the bristles (4) of another
group, these different materials having different

elasticity coefficients leading to different mechanical
behaviour of the groups of bristles, the elasticity

coefficient of the material of a bristle (3) of a first
group varying by from 10 % to 200 % with respect to the

elasticity coefficient of the material of a bristle (4)
of another group.
Brush according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the bristles (3) of one group

have a cross-sectional shape different from that of the
bristles (4) of another group, these shape differences

leading to differences in flexural resistance.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the first group of bristles (3)

consists of 5 to 95 % of the total number of bristles
in the brush, the second group of bristles (4), or all 

the other groups, being constituted by the complement,
namely 95 to 5 % of the total number of bristles.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the material used for most

flexible bristles is chosen from the group formed by
polyamides, polyether-block-amides and polyester

elastomers.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the material used for the less

flexible bristles is chosen from the group formed by
polyamides, polyethylenes, polytetrafluoroethylenes,

polyvinylidene fluorides, polyacetates and polyethylene
terephthalates.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the housing (9) of the rod (5)

has a flared shape, the large base of which is located
at the end of the rod (5).
Brush according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the flared shape is axisymmetrically

frustoconical.
Brush according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that in that the folded region (8) of

the bristles (3, 4) is held in place by a staple (10)
forcibly pushed into the housing (9) of the rod (5).
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the length (L) by which the

bristles of the brush project beyond the end of the rod
(5) is between 12 and 30 mm, limits inclusive.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the diameter of the circle (C)

circumscribing the cross-section of a bristle is
between 3/100 mm and 18/100 mm, limits inclusive.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that the shape of the cross-section of

a bristle of one group is chosen from the following
shapes: solid circular, hollow circular, horseshoeshaped,

V-shaped, flat, cruciform, and one equipped
with capillary grooves. 
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterized in that additives modifying the surface

finish and surface tension are incorporated into the
material of the bristles.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 13,
characterized in that the bristles have a diameter

chosen from 11 hundredths to 40 hundredths of a
millimetre.
