<ABSTRACT>
A locking differential is disclosed of the type including a clutch pack (35) 
operable to retard rotation between a gear case (11) and a pair of sidegears 

(23,25). A cam means (41) is operatively associated with the clutch means and 
includes an axially movable cam member (43) to engage the clutch pack. The 

clutch pack includes active clutch discs (63,73) operable to effect the rate of 
engagement of the clutch pack. At least one pair of active disc surfaces 

comprises pyrolytic carbon friction material (75) and the other surface 
comprises a non-pyrolytic carbon friction material. With repeated use and 

increasing temperature, the rate of engagement of the clutch pack increases, 
providing a "variable rate" locking differential.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application refers to a differential gear mechanism according to the 
preamble of claim 1. Such a differential gear mechanism is known from US-A-4 
389 909. The present invention relates to differential gear mechanisms, and more 
particularly, to such mechanisms of the type commonly referred to as "locking 
differentials". Differential gear mechanisms of the general type to which the present 
invention relates are broadly referred to as "limited slip differentials", and 
typically include a clutch pack which is operable to limit or retard differentiating 
action between the output gears (sidegears). More specifically, however, the 
present invention is intended for use on limited slips of the type referred to as 
"locking differentials", and will be described in connection therewith. In a 
locking differential, means are provided for engaging or locking the clutch set, 
rather than permitting it to slip (i.e., the slip is "limited" to the point of being 
nonexistent), thus substantially eliminating differentiating action between the 
output gears. Locking differentials are produced and sold commercially by the assignee 
of the present invention, with the construction and operation of such locking 
differentials being illustrated and described in great detail in US-A-4,389,909. 
In the known device, there is a 
flyweight mechanism which rotates about its axis of rotation at a speed 
representative of the differential speed between the two output gears. Above a 
predetermined rotational speed (speed of differentiation), the flyweight 
mechanism is actuated to cause ramping of a cam member relative to another 
cam member. This ramping action of the cam members results in axial 
movement of the one cam member, which initiates engagement of an adjacent  
 
clutch pack. Typically, the clutch pack is of the "self-actuating" type, i.e., a 
small amount of frictional engagement within the clutch pack further retards 
rotation of the adjacent cam member, resulting in further ramping action, which, 
in turn, causes further axial movement of the cam member and further 
engagement of the clutch pack. In the device of the above-incorporated patent, the clutch pack 
immediately adjacent the cam arrangement includes two types of clutch discs: 
1. "Active" discs are those discs disposed immediately adjacent, and 
operably associated with, the axially movable cam member and 
which determine the rate of engagement of the overall clutch pack.  2. "Inactive" discs are those discs which are not 
operably associated with
