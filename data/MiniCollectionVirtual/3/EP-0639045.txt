<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for cutting stalks or stems of plants and/or grass-like vegetation in an environmentally safe manner has counter-blades (2) that follow a circular path and rotary blades (1) arranged above said counter-blades (2). The distance (h) between the rotary blades (1) and the counter-blades (2) is adjustable and amounts to 2 mm maximum. The speed of rotation of the rotary blades (1) is adjustable between 10 and 50 m/s and the ratio between the surfaces of the counter-blade (2) which actually take part in the cutting process and the free surfaces of the intermediate spaces (21) is higher than one.

<CLAIMS>
Cutting apparatus for the environment-friendly cutting 
of stems or stalks of plants and/or grass-like plants, 

with at least one cutting unit (10) which comprises 
counter-cutters (2) mounted at intervals on a circular 

path and rotary blades (1) disposed above the counter-cutters 
(2), in which the ratio between the cutting 

surface area of a counter cutter (2) actually taking part 
in the cutting process and the area of the intermediate 

space (21) between two adjacent counter cutters (2) 
actually taking part in the cutting process is smaller 

than one,
 
characterized in that the distance h between the counter 

cutters (2) and the rotary blades (1) is adjustable 
between 0 
<
 h â‰¤ 2 mm and the speed of rotation of the 
rotary blades is adjustable between 10 and 50 m/s. 
Cutting apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the diameter of a circle containing the free end 

points of the counter cutters (2) is at most 20% greater 
than the diameter of the circular path of the rotary 

blades (1). 
Cutting apparatus according to either of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the counter-cutters (2) are 

fixed on a circular path on a mounting (9) of the cutting 
apparatus and the rotary blades (1) are mounted rotatably 

above the counter-cutters (2). 
Cutting apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the counter-cutters (2) are let in  

 
rotatably on a circular path below the rotary blades (1). 
Cutting apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by a plurality of cutting 

units (10) disposed on a mounting (9) of the cutting 
apparatus. 
Cutting apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that a separate drive (8) connected to an outside 

energy source (13) is provided for each cutting unit 
(10). 
Cutting apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that a common drive (8) connected to an outside energy 

source (13) is provided for all of the cutting units 
(10).
