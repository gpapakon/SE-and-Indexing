<ABSTRACT>
An elastic body (1) in which a multiplicity of actuators (2) are embedded. If the actuators are arranged individually or in groups, they exert a force on the material of the body, with the result that the latter changes its shape. Embedded sensors or switches measure the instantaneous position of the body. An imitation hand comprising such bodies can move its limbs in human fashion.

<CLAIMS>
Prehensile device deformable by actuators and out of elastic material wherein 
a quaternary number of actuators (2, 10, 17) close to one another is embedded 

(integrated) into the elastic material, and said actuators are switched separatly 
or in groups in order to achiev any change of form. 
Device according to claim 1 wherein
 
the device represent the form of a hand. 
Device according to claim 1 and 2 wherein
 
the actuators are shape memory metals (2, 10, 17) or thermostatic bimetals and 

work electromagnetically, piezoelectrically or electrostrictially. 
Device according to claim 1 to 3 wherein
 
the shape memory metals are realized spirally. 
Device for scanning the change of form of a body wherein
 
said device is out of elastic material (28, 34, 38) in which is embedded a big 

number of switches (18) or sensors close to one another which changes their 
output-signal in case if the inner pression in the surrounded elastic material 

changes because of the change of form of the body. 
Device according to claim 5 wherein
 
the elastic body (28, 34, 38) serves for scanning the change of form of the 

human hand (37) and for input of datas of the change in a computer and said 
elastic body has the form of a glove (38) in which the human hand (38) is put 

and moved.  
 
Method for using a prehensile device according to claim 1 and a scanning 
device according to claimes 5 and 6 in accordance with the master-slave-method 

wherin
 
the human hand (37) and the slave hand (16) are completed by identical 

scanner gloves (38) and the real position of the slave hand (16) is determind by 
direct comparison and the nominal position is achieved by suppelementary 

adjustment. 
Method according to claim 7 wherin
 
a self-learning algorithm controls the slave-hand and estimates the datas of 

comparison of the two gloves.
