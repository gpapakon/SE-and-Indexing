<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for preparing
lyophilized (S) (+)-4,4'-(1-methyl-1,2-ethanediyl)-bis(2,6-piperazinedione)
(hereinafter referred to as "ICRF-187")
salts, and further provides new lyophilized preparations of
these substances and their use.
The invention is also
concerned with new findings on light stability of ICRF-187
salts, and solutions thereof.ICRF-187 was described by Creighton in, inter alia, US
Patent 3,941,790 as a material useful for aiding regression
and palliation of cancer in mammals. In Pathologie
Biologie, 1987, 35 (No 1) 49-53, Green described how
certain anthracyclines are effective anti-tumour agents but
carry the side effect of a tendency to produce
cardiotoxicity upon chronic administration. Green,
however, also disclosed for the first time that ICRF-187
could protect against such cardiotoxicity. One particular
widely used anti-cancer drug suffering from the
disadvantage of associated cardiotoxicity is doxorubicin
hydrochloride. In US Patent 4,963,551, Palepu et al
described a method of formulating ICRF-187 in a manner
stated as facilitating intravenous (I.V.) administration of
this substance (and the manufacture of an I.V. product) as 
a cardioprotective agent to reduce or prevent
cardiotoxicity resulting from the administration of
doxorubicin hydrochloride.As for the manufacture of ICRF-187, Creighton, supra,
essentially described two methods. In the first method,
1,2-diaminopropane tetraacetic acid is heated with
formamide to result in incorporation of nitrogen and ring
closure. In the second method, the tetraamide
corresponding to the above tetraacid is heated in
polyphosphoric acid or phenol, bringing about cyclization.US Patent 4,764,614 describes an alternative synthesis in
which propylenediamine tetraacetic acid tetraamide is
treated in a dipolar aprotic solvent with an alkali metal
derivative of dimethyl sulfoxide to form a dialkali metal
salt of the desired bis-piperazinedione, the desired
heterocyclic product.EP-A-O 330 381 describes yet an alternative process for
preparing, inter alia, ICRF-187, in which a corresponding
tetranitrile is synthesized by reacting an appropriate
diamine with formaldehyde and an alkali metal cyanide. The
tetranitrile is then hydrated to yield an acid addition
salt of the corresponding tetraamide, and this latter
substance may then be cyclized. In Repta et al, J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 65(No 2) 238-242,
the tetraacid product is synthesized from 1,2-diaminopropane
dihydrochloride by reaction with
chloroacetic acid and
