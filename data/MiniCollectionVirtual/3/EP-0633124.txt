<ABSTRACT>
A method of depositing a thin membrane (105/340) so that it 
conforms to an irregular shaped surface (112) includes the steps of 

aligning 
the membrane (105/340) in a desired position with respect to the 

irregular 
surface (112) so that the membrane is in contact with at least some 

protruding portions (332) of the irregular surface (112), and drawing the 
membrane (105/340) down over the irregular surface (112) so that the 

membrane (105/340) is 
conformingly disposed around substantially all protrusions (332). The 

membrane (105/340) is drawn down by applying a substantially uniform 
differential pressure across the thin membrane (105/340) so as to urge 

the 
membrane (105/340) into conformal contact with irregular surface (112). 

An imager 
array fabricated with this process includes a scintillator having an 

irregular surface and a monolithic reflective layer disposed thereover 
in conformal contact with the irregular surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the conformal
deposition of thin membranes on irregularly-shaped
surfaces and devices formed thereby:This application is related to
EP-A-0 633 125 (Our ref: RD23011/4079), filed
concurrently herewith.In a number of devices, such as radiation imagers, it is
desirable to apply a thin membrane to an irregularly shaped surface.
For example, in a radiation imager in which a scintillator is optically
coupled to a photosensor, it is desirable to apply a layer of reflective
material to the surface of the scintillator opposite the surface adjoining
the photodetector so that optical photons generated in the scintillator
are reflected towards the photosensor. Commonly, one surface of the
scintillator is irregularly shaped, that is, protrusions extend from the
surface so that the surface is not flat. Such protrusions are needle or
pyramid-like structures that result from the deposition process and
serve to localize detection of photons generated in the array to the
area in which the incident radiation was absorbed in the scintillator.Application of reflective coatings to the irregular surface
of the scintillator poses a number of difficulties. Many scintillator
materials, such as cesium iodide, have large thermal expansion
coefficients and thus are extremely sensitive to processes in which a 
reflective coating is deposited onto the surface, such as by sputtering.
The relatively high temperatures associated with such deposition
processes (e.g., above about 300° - 400°C) cause cracks in the
scintillator material that create optical discontinuities and thus
degrade scintillator performance.A reflective coating on a scintillator surface desirably
significantly increases the number of optical photons detected by the
photosensor as compared with an arrangement in which the
scintillator has no reflective coating (e.g., an increase of at least one-third
or more in optical photons captured is desirable). Further, the
reflective coating should conform to the irregular shape of the
scintillator so that optical photons are directly coupled between the
reflective layer and the scintillator material, with few if any interstitial
voids between the scintillator material and the reflective material.
Additionally, the application of the reflective material should not
degrade the scintillator structure, either by thermally degrading the
material or mechanically deforming the needle or pyramid-like
structure of the scintillator. Reflective materials having the desired
optical and physical characteristics are
