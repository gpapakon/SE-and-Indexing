<ABSTRACT>
A multiple-speed ratio transmission mechanism for an 
automotive vehicle includes a torque input shaft (12), an 

output shaft (14), an intermediate shaft (16), these three 
shafts rotatably supported on a common axis, and a 

countershaft (18) mounted parallel to the other shafts. 
Multiple pinion-gear pairs (26, 36, 28, 40, 30, 42) are 

supported on the three coaxial shafts and countershaft. A 
planetary gear unit (98), including a sun gear (104), ring 

gear (100), and a set of planet pinions (106) rotatably 
supported on a carrier (108), has its input connected to the 

intermediate shaft (16) and the output connected to the 
output shaft (14). Synchronisers (52, 68, 82) driveably 

connect a member of the pinion-gear pairs to one of the 
shafts. A shift mechanism transmits motion of a shift lever 

(122) to shift forks (146, 148) that move synchroniser 
sleeves (58, 70, 84) into engagement with the selected gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the arrangement of gears,
shafts, and synchronisers of an automotive transmission,
especially to such a transmission of the type having a
countershaft or layshaft disposed parallel to a power input
shaft.When the engine of a motor vehicle is idling and the
neutral clutch that connects the engine to a manual
transmission is disengaged, the speed of the engine varies
as a result of cyclic irregularity intrinsic in the
operation of an internal combustion engine. Countershaft
manual transmissions for automotive use contain gear sets
whose members are in continuous meshing engagement, though
the gear selector of the transmission is in the neutral
position. When the main drive clutch is engaged and the
gear selector is in the neutral position, speed changes of
the engine transmitted to the gearset produce noise called
"neutral rollover gear rattle." When the engaged gear teeth
change position with respect to each other due to engine
speed variations, the teeth of the driven gear contact
alternately the driving face and the non driving face of the
driving pinion.To reduce or eliminate this objectionable noise,
various devices have been employed to take up clearances
between the faces of the gear and mating pinion. These
devices include a wheel coaxially arranged with the gear
having similar teeth to those of the gear, and means for
elastically maintaining the teeth of the gear in position
that is angularly offset relative to the gear. A mechanical
spring, usually a helical spring, located radially offset
from the axis of the gear, applies a force directed
tangentially to the axis tending to rotate the angular
element with respect to the gear wheel. Other means such as
elastomeric material have been used in the prior art to bias
an angular member angularly with respect to a gear to 
maintain contact between the gear teeth in order to avoid
gear rattle.U.S. Patent 4,718, 295 describes the use of a one-way
clutch located on the input shaft between a gear wheel and a
cylindrical surface of the shaft. The one-way clutch permits
a one-way drive connection so that power can be transmitted
through the clutch from the input shaft to either of two
countershafts when fourth and fifth gear ratios are selected
by the vehicle operator.Patent specification DE-A-4 122 628 discloses
in accordance with the features of the preamble of claim 1
a vehicle
gear transmission providing multiple gear ratios and having
an input shaft coupled through a succession of coaxially
arranged intermediate shafts and
