<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a collecting container (1) for sweepings, mowings or the like, with a loading blower (6) which is driven via a cardan shaft (4) from a power take-off shaft (3) of a carrier or traction vehicle (2) and the outlet of which is arranged so as to open into the collecting container (1) and the inlet of which is connected via a conveying conduit to an implement for picking up sweepings, a mower or the like, the loading blower (6), the cardan-shaft connection (5) located on the blower side and a gear-type transmission device between the latter and the rotor of the loading blower (6) being arranged in the region of the collecting-container front wall (10) which faces the carrier or traction vehicle and, as seen in relation to the travelling surface, extends at an inclination to the direction of travel in terms of its basic course and which, together with a trap (17) arranged facing the carrier or traction vehicle (2) and pivotable about an axis located in the upper region of the container and extending horizontally and vertically in relation to the direction of travel, limits the interior of the collecting container (1). A collecting container (1), which is made more space-saving in respect of the direction of travel of the carrier or traction vehicle (2) and which is designed to make do with few individual constructional elements, is provided in that the collecting-container front wall (10) is designed as a supporting holding and bearing element for the loading blower (6) and for the cardan-shaft connection (5) located on the blower side, that is to say for the shaft stub which is connected thereto and which carries a gear element for the drive connection with the rotor of the loading blower (6).

Collector box (1) for sweepings, grass cuttings, or the 
like, with a blower (6) driven via a universal joint 

propeller shaft (4) from the power take-off (3) of a 
carrier or tractor vehicle (2), with an outlet (7) in the 

collector box (1) and an inlet (8) which is connected to 
a sweeper unit, mower, etc., via a conve
yor tube, where 
the blower (6), the universal joint propeller shaft 

connection (5) to the blower and a gear transmission unit 
(9) between this and the blower rotor (6) are arranged in 

the region of the front of the collector box (10), which 
faces the carrier or tractor vehicle and essentially 

points away from the direction of travel, which, together 
with a swinging trap, facing away from the carrier or 

tractor vehicle, and which pivots about an axis in the 
upper part of the container, horizontal and perpendicular 

to the direction of travel, defines the inner area of the 
collector box, characterised in that the front of the 

collector box is designed as a load-bearing retaining and 
bearing element for the blower (6) and the universal 

joint propeller shaft connection to the blower, i.e. the 
shaft end connected to the blower (5), which carries a 

gear element (11) for the drive connection (11, 9, 12) to 
the blower rotor (6). 
Container according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
shaft end (5) of the universal joint propeller shaft 

and/or the rotor shaft (13) of the blower (6) are 
constructed so as to pass through the collector box front 

wall, whereby the front face of the blower housing, which 
faces the collector box, corresponds especially to the 

collector box front wall (10). 
Container according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the gear transmission equipment (11, 9, 12),  

 
especially using a drive belt (9), preferably a direct 

belt drive, preferably with a transmission ratio not 
equal to 1:1, is arranged to run inside the collector box 

front wall between the shaft end (5) of the universal 
joint propeller shaft connection at the blower and the 

rotor of the blower (6), and, seen from the inside of the 
collector box, is covered by a thin covering plate (14), 

whereby the bearing sets of the rotor shaft (13) and the 
shaft end (5) are especially arranged to run in a plane 

perpendicular to their longitudinal axes. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the collector box front wall (10) 

is shaped in order to match the contours, completely or 
partially, of the apparatus contained within, i.e. blower 

(6), universal joint propeller shaft connection at the 
blower side (5), gear transmission equipment. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the blower (6), is mounted offset 

to the side, in comparison with the vehicle's 
longitudinal axis or the universal joint propeller shaft 

connection, and is preferably fitted with an air intake 
facing obliquely outwards. 
Container according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
side walls (15) are bowed outwards (16) to accept the 

blower (6). 
Container according to claim 6, characterised in that 
this side-bowing (16) is symmetrical on either side of 

the vehicle's longitudinal axis. 
Container according to one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that the collector box front wall (10) 

is mounted asymmetrical and perpendicular to the 
vehicle's longitudinal axis, especially on the side  

 
opposite the air intake of the blower (6), where a wall 

configuration (25) enlarges the collecting box cavity 
(1). 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that when seen from a side elevation, 

the equipment mounted on the collector box front wall 
(10) projects into the area occupied by the closed trap 

in the collector box 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the trap (17), as a part of the 

collector box (1), is made from synthetic material, and 
can be opened and closed by means of an operating 

mechanism - especially a piston-cylinder assembly (18) - 
which has one end attached to the trap (17) and the other 

end attached to an operating device (26) for a closing 
mechanism (19) designed to be located between the 

collector box front wall (10), or side walls attached to 
it, and the trap itself. 
Container according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the piston rod (20, 23) of the piston-cylinder assembly 

(18) - especially working on a lever (21) which operates 
the trap - is constructed as an elbowed rod which is 

deformed and moved to the side to the side to relieve the 
effects of pressurisation. 
Container according to claim 11, characterised in that 
the elbowed rod is formed from a connecting rod (23) 

connected to the actual piston rod (20) by means of a 
joint (22), whereby the joint (22), the piston rod (20) 

and the connecting rod (23) are connected to each other 
with regard to their longitudinal directions. 
Container according to claim 12, characterised in that 
the connection struts (24) for attachment to the carrier  

 
or tractor vehicle (2) are fixed to the collector box 

front wall, which hold the collector box independently on 
the ground as a piggy-back mechanism, either rigidly or 

vertically adjustably, in the same longitudinal axis via 
a plurality of wheels, which can be rotated about their 

vertical axis. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the blower (6) is contained within 

the width of the collector box or trap. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the collecting box (1) has at least 

one air outlet screen (27, 28) which is located in the 
upper wall bordering the trap, and is covered by a hinged 

lid (29) which tilts perpendicular to the direction of 
travel, about a horizontal axis which is in front of the 

air outlet (29) as regards the direction of travel. 
Container according to one of claims 2 to 15, 
characterised in that the interior of the collector box, 

as seen from the front, is comprised of an area of the 
front wall (10) itself and a cover area (14).
