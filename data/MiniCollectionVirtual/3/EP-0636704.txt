<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for depositing silicon nitride on a 
substrate (
28
) is described. The substrate (
28
) is placed in a deposition zone (
24
) 
within a deposition chamber (
22
) and a process gas comprising a silicon 
containing gas and a nitrogen containing gas is introduced into the deposition 

zone (
24
) through an inlet gas conduit (
30
). The substrate (
28
) is heated to a 
temperature T
d
 which is sufficiently high to cause the process gas to deposit 
silicon nitride on the substrate (
28
) and the resultant process gas byproducts are 
exhausted through an exhaust gas conduit (
32
). At least one of the inlet and 
exhaust gas conduits (
30
) and (
32
) are heated to a temperature T
h
 within the range 
ΔT
h
, wherein all the temperatures T
h
 are sufficiently higher than T
c
 the 
temperature at which process gas condenses in the gas conduits, so that 

substantially no condensate deposits in the gas conduits, and all the 
temperatures T
h
 are sufficiently lower than the deposition temperature T
d
, so 
that substantially no silicon nitride deposits in the gas conduits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a method and apparatus for depositing
silicon nitride films.Silicon nitride films having thicknesses between 5 - 100 nm (50-1000 Å) are
used as capacitor dielectrics, selective oxidation masks and for passivation in
integrated circuits. These films are generally deposited by chemical vapor
deposition ("CVD") in multiple wafer batch reactors that typically process
batches of 50-100 wafers at a time. Typical CVD processes are described in
U.S. Patent No. 3,637,423 to Sestrich, et al.; U.S. Patent No. 4,189,992 to
Doo, et al.; U.S. Patent No. 4,158,717 to Nelson, et al.; U.S. Patent No.
4,181,751 to Hall, et al.; and U.S. Patent No. 4,279,947 to Goldman, et al.--all
of which are incorporated herein by this reference.However, existing multiple wafer reactors and processes for the
deposition of silicon nitride have several problems. One problem is that these
reactors and processes often deposit a nonuniform silicon nitride film. The
thickness and the electrical properties of the film vary across the diameter of
each wafer and can also vary from wafer to wafer. This non-uniformity is even
more severe for wafers having large diameters (exceeding 20 cm (8")) which are
increasingly being used in the semiconductor industry. Processing of large
diameter wafers in multiple batch reactors is risky because the entire stack of
50-100 wafers, each wafer typically worth between $500 to $5,000, is at risk.Another problem with existing silicon nitride processes and
reactors is that the wafers are typically exposed to ambient air during the 
loading and unloading of the wafers from the reactors. Exposure to air and
moisture can cause an oxide layer to form on the wafers which inhibits the
deposition of a silicon nitride film. Consequently, the oxide layer is typically
removed before deposition of the silicon nitride film. This adds a process step
and increases the cost of processing the wafer.Reactors that process a single wafer at a time generally deposit
a more uniform film. However, a critical problem with known single wafer
reactors and processes is that condensates deposit in the gas conduits and
on the reactor walls. These deposits cause the conduits to clog up and require
that the reactor be frequently cleaned. Furthermore, the deposits on the reactor
walls can eventually fragment and generate particles which contaminate the
wafer. It is only in the final stages of the manufacturing process, when the fully
processed wafers are each worth between $5,000 to $50,000, that the
contamination
