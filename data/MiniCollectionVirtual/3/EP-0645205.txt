<ABSTRACT>
An injection apparatus for a hot-chamber die-cast 
machine is disclosed including a cylindrical sleeve (10); a 

plunger body (8) slidable within the sleeve (10) and having 
a circumferential groove (17) on an outer cylindrical 

surface and passages (16, 18) extending from a pressurizing 
face to the groove. Divided seal rings (9) fit loosely in 

the groove (17) of the plunger body (8) in such a manner 
that the divided rings (9) are urged radially outwardly by 

the pressure of the molten metal in the sleeve (10) through 
the passages (16, 18) when the plunger body (8) is moved. 

The divided rings (9) satisfy the following conditions:


t³ ≦ 4.5 x 10² (mm) x D² x P/E 



 
where t: thickness (mm) of the divided rings (9), E: Young's 

modulus (Pa) of the divided rings (9), D: inner diameter 
(mm) of the sleeve (10), and P: pressure (Pa) which should 

be exerted onto the molten metal when injected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an injection 
apparatus for a hot-chamber die-cast machine, and more 
particularly, to an injection apparatus having a new and 
improved injection plunger which can be easily designed 
and produced and is useful to overcome various problems, 
such as leakage of molten metal or the like, in practical 
use. An injection apparatus for a hot-chamber die-cast 
machine for casting molten metal, such as aluminum 
or a similar metal, has been conventionally known in the 
prior art. One known hot-chamber die-cast machines for 
casting aluminum is generally shown in Fig. 10, in which 
a furnace 1 for melting and accommodating a molten 
metal 15 includes heaters 3 for heating the furnace 1 up 
to a certain temperature so as to keep the metal in the 
furnace to a molten state. The furnace 1 mounted on a 
base frame 2 is provided with a goose-neck 13 having a 
nozzle 14 which is forced and fastened to a mold 4 
attached to a die-plate 5. In order to rigidly connect the mold 4 to the 
nozzle 14, the base frame 2 is clamped to the die-plate 5 
by a clamping means (not shown). Above the furnace, in a 
sleeve 10, is inserted a plunger 8 which is connected to 
a hydraulic piston 6 by means of a coupling 7, so that 
when the piston 6 moves downward, the plunger 20 is also 
moved downward to pressurize the molten metal in the 
sleeve 10. Thus, the molten metal flows through the 
goose-neck 13 and is injected via the nozzle 14 into the 
cavity of the mold 4 and a casting operation is thus 
performed. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications (kokai)  
 
Nos. 56-23358 and 56-23359 discloses a plunger used in 
the above-mentioned injection apparatus, in which the 
plunger 8 is a simple cylindrical type plunger, as shown 
in Fig. 11, and therefore has no pressure ring or the 
like. However, such a simple cylindrical type plunger 
having no pressure ring must be very accurately made in 
order to obtain a stable sealing effect between the outer 
diameter of the cylindrical type plunger and the inner 
diameter of the sleeve. Thus, the clearance between the 
cylindrical plunger and the sleeve must strictly be 
controlled to be less than 0.04 mm. Nevertheless, since 
the material of the cylindrical plunger is a ceramic, it 
is very difficult to obtain a precise dimension over the 
entire surface of the plunger. Also, a cost for making 
such a ceramic plunger is thus relatively expensive. When assembling the above-mentioned plunger 
into the sleeve, considerable skill is required to 
position the sleeve with
