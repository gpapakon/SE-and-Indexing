Pessary (1) in the approximate form of a cube 
made of elastic material 


with absorbent cups which more or less fill its 
surfaces and which are in the form of depressions 

(2) which have been hollowed out towards the centre 
of the cube, and 
with a grip band (3), in particular a grip loop, 
which is fixed on a cube wall and is used for 

removing the pessary from the application site, 
 
characterized in that 


the grip band (3) consists of an elastic material, 
in particular of a silicone elastomer, and 
the material of the pessary (1) in the area of 
attachment of the grip band (3) is harder than in 

the remaining area of the cube. 
Pessary according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the grip band (3) passes through the cube wall 

between adjoining edge areas (9) of two adjacent hollowed 
depressions (2). 
Pessary according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the grip band (3) passes through at least one 

cube wall in the area of a cube corner (4). 
Pessary according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the grip band (3) passes 

through three hollowed depressions (2) assigned to a 
common cube corner (4) . 
Pessary according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the central of the three hollowed depressions (2) 

has two through-openings (6), adjacent to each other at 
a distance, for the grip band (3).  

 
Pessary according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the grip band (3) is 

designed as an endless annular loop. 
Pessary according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the annular loop is produced by integral connection, 

in particular by bonding together the ends (7, 8) of the 
grip band (3). 
Pessary according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the grip band (3) has a 

band thickness, particularly a transverse diameter, of 
1.5 to 3 mm. 
Pessary according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized by an annular loop diameter of 5 to 

6 cm. 
Pessary according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it consists of the same 

silicone elastomer as the grip band. 
Pessary according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it is perforated for the 

passage of fluid. 
Pessary according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the perforation (10) passes through the cube wall 

between adjacent edge areas (9) of two adjacent hollowed 
depressions (2). 
Pessary according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that each cube wall has at least one perforation (10).
