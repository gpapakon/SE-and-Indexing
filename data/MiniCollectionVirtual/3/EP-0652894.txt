<ABSTRACT>
Synthetic pulmonary surfactants having antioxidant properties consisting of a complex of a polypeptide of 3-4 amino acid residues, with an antioxidant moiety, and a lipid consisting of one or more of the lipids associated with natural pulmonary surfactant were prepared. These surfactants are useful in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the synthesis of a series of 
3 to 4 amino acid polypeptides having antioxidants 
covalently linked to the peptide either directly or through 
a linker region. These modified peptides are useful as 
synthetic lung surfactants having useful antioxidants 
structurally as part of the peptide. Also described are 
the preparation of mixtures of these polypeptides with 
lipids, the method for production of same, and 
pharmaceutical compositions which are effective in the 
treatment of mammalian respiratory distress syndromes. The lungs exist in a delicate balance between toxic 
oxidants and the protective activities of antioxidant 
defense systems. An imbalance in this system, either 
through an increase in oxidants or a dysfunction of the 
protective antioxidant defense systems, can lead to 
pathophysiological events in the lung causing pulmonary 
dysfunction. One type of pulmonary dysfunction in which an 
increase in oxidants can contribute is respiratory distress 
syndrome (RDS).  
 Infantile respiratory distress syndrome is a leading 
cause of death in the first 28 days of life. Infantile RDS 
strikes 1 in 100 babies worldwide and about 10 percent die. 
The syndrome rarely occurs in term infants but is generally 
associated with immaturity and low-birth weight (under 2 
kg). Adult RDS shows similar clinical characteristics and 
pathophysiology to the infantile disease and is generally 
managed in an intensive care facility. The adult disease 
has diverse etiologies, many resulting from lung insults, 
such as diffuse infections, aspiration of the gastric 
contents, inhalation of irritants and toxins, and pulmonary 
edema arising from such sources as narcotic overdose. RDS is correlated with an absence or dysfunction of the 
lung surfactant which coats the alveoli of the lungs where 
gas exchange occurs, and has been associated with oxygen 
centered free radicals in the lung or lung cavity known as 
oxidants, such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, 
hydrogen peroxide which can generate hydroxyl radicals, and 
lipid peroxides, which have been implicated in cellular 
injury (Heffner, et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 104: 531-554 
1989); (Halliwell, FASEB J. 1: 358-364 1987). Synthetic lung surfactant of larger polypeptides having 
antioxidant moieties, have been described in U.S. Patent 
application serial no. 07/789,918 filed November 4, 
1991, which is herein incorporated by reference. However, 
the present invention provides an effective synthetic lung 
surfactant having
