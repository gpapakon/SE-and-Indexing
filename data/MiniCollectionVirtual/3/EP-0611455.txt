<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
telescopic, or magnifying, spectacles and more particularly
is directed to an adjustable magnifying spectacle
for use by individuals having severely impaired
vision or having implanted intraocular lenses.Implantation of intraocular lenses, for example,
cataract lenses, has now become commonplace. Many
types of intraocular lenses are utilized which are
implanted into the eye of an individual and consist of
an optic lens and haptic for fixing of the intraocular
lens in an anterior chamber or a posterior chamber of
the eye. Many of these intraocular lenses are of a
single focal length, and it is therefore necessary for
the user to utilize spectacles or the like in order to
enable the individual to correct his vision for a
range outside of the fixed-focus implanted intraocular
lens.In the event that, after a lens is implanted, the
patient's vision continues to change, the magnification
required may be greater than can be supplied by
spectacles having a single objective lens therein.
Consequently, changes or variations in the individual's
vision must be accommodated by a refitting of
glasses or the like, which is both time-consuming and
expensive.Thus, because of the unique problems surrounding
the individual with implanted lenses, proper correction
to obtain improved visual acuity of the individual
is difficult. Because of the fixed focal length of
the implanted intraocular lens, problems are encountered
in switching from various viewing situations, 
such as reading to, for example, the watching of television. In most
instances, the design of a single objective lens assembly mounted in a
conventional spectacle frame is unable to provide proper improved vision for
various viewing situations.FR-A-58495 discloses spectacles in which a pair of telescopic lens
systems are mounted on the spectacle frame, the eye piece of the telescopic
lens system being fixed in the plane of the frame, whilst the objective lens
systems are mounted on a slideable cylindrical support. Both telescopic lens
systems are linked to an adjusting mechanism thereby providing
simultaneous adjustment of the distances between the eye piece and
objective lens systems.US-A-5030231 describes a lens system in which an objective lens
must be rotated in order to adjust the distance between the lens and the
eye.The present invention provides a spectacle system which together
with an intraocular lens forms a Galilean telescope system for magnifying
images to aid the vision of the impaired individual in order
