<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child safety seat of 
the type having a seat back and a harness including two 
shoulder straps, each of which has an end which projects 
through an opening in the seat back and is attached to 
retractor means mounted behind the seat back whereby the 
lengths of the shoulder straps can be adjusted while the 
seat is occupied. A safety seat of this type is disclosed in WO-A-8602050. 
The two ends of the shoulder straps are connected 
to a common strap which extends down behind the backrest 
portion and under a seat portion of the child seat to a 
retractor located behind the bottom of the seat back of the 
child seat. With this arrangement, the shoulder straps are 
turned through an angle of more than 270Â° where they pass 
through the openings in the seat back, thus resulting in 
higher friction which may lead to undesirable belt slack. 
In addition, the load imposed by each shoulder strap on the 
seat back is substantially greater than the tension in such 
shoulder strap. EP-A-0287259 discloses a child seat with 
attachments for the shoulder straps of the harness on a 
carriage which is mounted on the rear side of the backrest 
for vertical sliding movement relative thereto. It is an object of the invention to 
provide a child safety seat which is not subject to the above noted problems. According to the invention, in a child safety seat 
of the type described above, the retractor means are 
mounted behind the seat back adjacent to the openings 
therein. The retractor means may comprise a separate 
retractor for each shoulder strap mounted adjacent to the 
corresponding opening in the seat back. Preferably, the two retractors are reels mounted 
on a common shaft and coupled for simultaneous rotation so 
as to ensure that the lengths of the two shoulder straps 
remain equal to one another. In a preferred form of the invention, the two  
 
retractors are mounted on a carriage which is mounted on 
the rear side of the seat back for vertical sliding 
movement relative thereto. Preferably, the carriage is 
coupled to the seat back by a jacking screw so that its 
height relative to the seat back can be adjusted by 
rotation of the jacking screw. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a view of one side of a child safety 
seat in accordance with the invention; Figure 2 is a back view of the seat shown in 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a view of the upper part of the other 
side of the seat
