thermoplastic resin by a press-molding process by feeding 

a reinforcing material-containing thermoplastic resin (1) 
heated to a temperature not lower than the melting 

temperature of the resin into the cavity between male and 
female halves of a die (2,3), clamping the die and cooling the 

die, wherein the press-molding is carried out under the 
conditions tha

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing concrete forms made of thermoplastic resin. As concrete forms, products made of wood have so 
far been used predominantly. Concrete forms made of 
wood, however, have the disadvantage that they are heavy 
and readily damaged . In addition, the problem of the earth's 
environment has become important in recent years. 
For these reasons, concrete forms made of resins are 
being developed as substitute for wooden ones. Concrete forms made of resin are produced 
by, for example, press-molding a thermoplastic resin in 
which mechanical strengths have been improved by 
compounding a reinforcing material such as reinforcing 
fiber, inorganic granular filler or the like. This 
method of production, however, is disadvantageous in that 
deformations such as torsion, lifting, etc. appear in the 
top board which is the broad and flat part of the 
obtained concrete form. If such deformations appear, a concrete form 
becomes quite difficult to handle because of its large 
size. Further, such deformations exercise adverse 
influences upon the function of concrete form. For  
 
example, the deformations greatly deteriorate the workability of 
concrete-placing and, in some extreme cases, make the 
concrete form unusable. Thus, it is an important problem 
of the time to develop a process for producing a 
deformation-free concrete form from a thermoplastic 
resin. In view of the above, it is the object of the present invention to provide 
a process for producing a concrete form made of thermoplastic 
resin which shows only a small extent of deformation. This object has been achieved by the surprising finding that, 
in the case of a 
press molding process, the molding conditions, namely the 
period of time from completion of feeding a melted resin 
to completion of clamping and the relation between flow 
length L of the fed resin and thickness T of the molded 
product, exercise a great influence upon deformation of 
product, and the deforming behavior can be improved when 
the molding conditions are in specified ranges. Based on 
this finding, the present invention was accomplished. Thus, the present invention provides a process 
for producing a concrete form made of a thermoplastic 
resin which comprises carrying out a press-molding 
process by using an open-close type male-female die, 
feeding a reinforcing material-containing thermoplastic 
resin heated to a temperature not lower than the melting 
temperature of the resin into the cavity between the male 
and
