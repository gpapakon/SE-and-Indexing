<ABSTRACT>
In the improved transporter car, the cradle (4) 
rotates on a virtual fifth wheel (RV) composed of a 

non-loadbearing kingbolt (10), coinciding with a 
barycentrically located vertical axis (X), by which 

the cradle (4) is anchored to a fixed structure (6) 
with the freedom to rotate about the axis, and a 

plurality of wheels (11a, 11b) mounted between the 
bottom face of the cradle (4) and the top face of 

the fixed structure, typically a pair of beams (6a, 
6b); the wheels describe arcs of rotation centred 

on the axis (X), and are spaced in such a way as to 
create a turntable of generous diameter capable of 

affording rigid support to a broad expanse of the 
cradle when the beams (6a, 6b) beneath are elevated 

and flexed. The cradle (4) is also equipped with 
stabilizer wheels positioned at each end, which are 

lowered onto the ground when the cradle is rotated 
into the loading and offloading position so as to 

keep the structure of the cradle properly balanced 
and essentially parallel with the surface beneath.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in 
a rail car of the type utilized for carrying and 
transporting commercial road vehicles. There is by now a widespread awareness of the ever 
present and severe problem inherent in the threat 
to safe, high-speed travel on roads and motorways 
posed by the large number of heavy goods vehicles 
(typically TIRs) currently in circulation. One attempt at alleviating this situation in some 
measure has been to promote the idea (not least by 
legislating to prohibit circulation on the highway 
at certain times), that vehicles of the type in 
question could be transported by rail, especially 
when scheduled for the most part simply to transit 
non-stop across given territories or countries. In this context, the same applicant has already 
filed a specification (Application nÂ° 3568A/90 for 
Italian patent) disclosing a rail car essentially 
comprising a number of basic assemblies carried by 
a pair of standard rail bogies, namely:  a fixed structure consisting in a pair of parallel 
beams interconnecting two flat car bodies mounted 
each by way of a spherical bearing to the relative 
bogie; a movable cradle structure of rigid embodiment 
stably accommodating a road vehicle, such as can be 
positioned on and anchored to the flat car body at 
each end; also elevating means positioned centrally 
beneath and permanently associated with the cradle, 
by which the cradle structure itself can be raised 
from the bogies and the rails; means interposed between the cradle structure and 
the elevating means, by which the cradle can be 
rotated about a vertical axis, coinciding with its 
centre of mass, from an inboard carrying position 
of longitudinal alignment with the fixed structure 
to an outboard load/offload position, angled away 
from the fixed structure; interlocking means designed to interact between 
the cradle structure and the longitudinal members 
of the fixed structure when the cradle is raised 
from the transport position to the inboard elevated 
position, in such a way as to flex the longitudinal 
members and thus distance the flat car bodies from 
one another. This type of solution allows a road haulage vehicle 
to be loaded and offloaded simply and swiftly, and 
without any requirement for special infrastructures 
to be incorporated into the goods yard (other than 
a platform elevated to the level of the rotating 
structure so that the vehicle can roll on or off); 
the embodiment of the cradle structure also permits 
of accommodating a variety of loads
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
1) An improvement to a rail car for carrying and 
transporting road haulage vehicles or commercial 

vehicles generally, of the type comprising a pair 
of bogies (1) running on rails (3), and interposed 

between the two bogies: 

a fixed structure (6) consisting in at least one 
pair of beams (6a, 6b) disposed mutually parallel 

in a common plane substantially coinciding with the 
plane occupied by the bogies (1) of which the ends 

are associated with respective flat car bodies (6c, 
6d) connected each to a corresponding bogie (1), in 

such a way that the two bogies are interconnected; 
a rigid, movable bearing structure (4) of cradle 
embodiment stably accommodating the road vehicle 

(5), furnished with arms (4a) at each end and able 
thus to rest on the flat car bodies (6c, 6d); 
elevating means (7) serving to raise the cradle 
structure (4) off the bogies (1), located centrally 

and beneath the cradle structure and capable thus 
of controlled movement between at least an at-rest 

 
limit position, substantially compassed within the 

overall dimensions of the rail car and exhibiting a 
configuration of minimum height, and an operative 

elevating limit position substantially outside the 
dimensional compass of the rail car, exhibiting an 

extended configuration and engaged in contact with 
a datum surface (P) beneath; 
rotation means (9) actuated by an external control 
when the elevating means (7) are in the operative 

position, by which the cradle structure (4) is made 
to swing about a barycentrically located vertical 

axis (X) between an inboard position substantially 
within the overall dimensional compass of the two 

bogies (1), and an outboard position projecting 
beyond the dimensional compass of the bogies (1), 

in which a vehicle (5) can roll on and roll off; 
interlocking means (60) by which to restrain the 
movable cradle structure (4) and the beams (6a, 6b) 

of the fixed structure one against another, brought 
into operation concurrently with the movement of 

the cradle to the elevated position in such a way 
as to raise and flex the beams (6a, 6b), thereby 

distancing the two flat car bodies (6c, 6d) one 
from another and increasing the relative internal 

clearance in the longitudinal direction,
 

characterized 
in that rotation means (9) consist in a virtual 
fifth wheel (RV) comprising a non-loadbearing 

kingbolt (10) stably interposed between the fixed 
structure (6) and the movable cradle structure (4) 

and coinciding with the barycentric vertical axis 
(X), thereby connecting the two structures (4, 6) 

while allowing the cradle (4) to rotate in response 
to the action of power transmission means impinging 

on the kingbolt (10), also a plurality of rolling 
elements (lla, llb) freely interposed between the 

bottom face of the cradle (4) and a plane occupied 
by the top faces of the beams (6a, 6b), disposed 

tangentially to the vertical axis (X) of rotation, 
of which the function is to provide a turntable of 

generous diameter and thus allow a rigid bearing 
surface of the cradle (4) to settle on the pair of 

beams (6a, 6b) during the elevating movement when 
the beams are flexed; and, 
in that the cradle structure (4) is equipped with 
stabilizing means (21) capable of movement in a 

vertical direction, positioned at each end of the 
structure and in such a way as to interact with the 

datum surface (P) whenever the cradle is rotated to 
the outboard position, thereby ensuring that the 

 
cradle itself remains balanced and substantially 

parallel to the datum surface (P). 
2) An improvement as in claim 1, wherein the cradle 
structure (4) and the fixed structure (6) are 

mutually restrained in the inboard configuration by 
second interlocking means (12) operating between 

the bottom faces of the cradle (4) at each end and 
the corresponding part of the fixed structure (6), 

and between the arms (4a) of the cradle and the 
relative flat car bodies (6c, 6d), in such a way as 

to pin the cradle (4) longitudinally and vertically 
to the fixed structure (6). 
3) An improvement as in claim 2, wherein the second 
interlocking means (12) comprise: 


a first set of four hydraulic actuators (13), each 
secured by way of screw means (15) to the fixed 

structure (6), horizontally disposed and directed 
toward a corresponding face of the cradle (4) and 

extendible to an operative position in which a 
tapered bolt (16) afforded by the free end of the 

relative rod (20) is caused to locate in a matching 

and correspondingly positioned first socket (17) 
associated with the cradle (4); 
a second set of four hydraulic actuators (14), 
each secured vertically to a respective arm (4a) of 

the cradle and extendible thus to an operative 
position in which a tapered bolt (16) afforded by 

the free end of the relative rod (20) locates in a 
matching second socket (18) associated with the 

respective flat car body (6c, 6d); and, 
safety spring means (19), associated with each of 
the four hydraulic actuators of both sets (13, 14) 

at the end remote from the tapered bolt (16) and 
impinging in the axial direction on the relative 

rod (20) in such a way as to maintain the bolt (16) 
in the extended operative position. 
4) An improvement as in claim 1, wherein the elevating 
means (7) are mounted to the pair of beams (6a, 6b) 

at points near to the barycentric vertical axis (X) 
of rotation, and consist in four mutually opposed 

pairs of cylinders (22, 23) of which first outer 
ends are anchored pivotably to separate points of a 

load bearing platform (24) rigidly associated with 
the beams (6a, 6b) in the transverse direction and 

with the kingbolt (10) at centre, and the remaining 
ends anchored jointly to one of four corresponding 

single feet (25) positioned to enter into contact 
 

with a datum surface (P) afforded by the railway 
track (3), such that in the at-rest limit position, 

the two mutually opposed cylinders (22, 23) of each 
pair are accommodated in coaxial alignment within a 

respective recess (26) created between a pair of 
horizontal and parallel brackets (27, 28) secured 

to and positioned outside the relative dimensional 
compass of the relative beam (6a, 6b) and forming a 

part of the platform (24), the platform being also 
one and the same as the means (60) by which the 

cradle structure (4) and the fixed structure (6) 
are interlocked. 
5) An improvement as in claim 1, wherein the rolling 
elements (11) comprise at least two sets of four 

freely rotatable wheels, a first set (29) secured 
to the cradle structure (4), arranged two on each 

side of the vertical axis (X) of rotation and in 
such a manner as to roll in a corresponding pair of 

arcuate channels (31) afforded by the two beams 
(6a, 6b), and a second set (30) secured in a plane 

beneath the cradle (4) coinciding substantially 
with the pair of beams (6a, 6b), arranged two at 

each end of the fixed structure (6) and freely 
engaging a second pair of arcuate channels (32) 

 
afforded by the underside of the cradle (4). 
6) An improvement as in claim 1, wherein stabilizing 
means (21) consist in hydraulic actuators (33) 

positioned in pairs at opposite ends of the rigid 
cradle structure (4), each with one end secured to 

the cradle by screw means (34), and the remaining 
end fitted with a freely revolving wheel (35) set 

to roll on a line tangential to the barycentric 
axis (X) of rotation and capable of movement thus 

between a raised and non-operative limit position, 
assumed in the inboard configuration of the cradle, 

in which the wheel (35) is disposed within the 
vertical compass of the cradle structure (4), and 

an operative lowered position of contact with the 
datum surface (P), assumed when the cradle (4) is 

rotated from the inboard configuration to the 
outboard or roll-on/roll-off position.
