<ABSTRACT>
A machine tool having a tool which is moveable 
relatively to the workpiece to be machined along an axis, 

comprises thermosensors (30A-30D) for sensing temperatures 
of a plurality of components of the machine tool. 

Responsive to the sensed temperatures neural networks (42) 
infer thermal deformations of the machine components, 

respectively. Based on the inferred values of thermal 
deformations a correction signal (X4, Y4, Z4) is obtained 

and then combined with a drive signal (X2,Y2,Z2) for 
moving the tool to correct an error in positioning in the 

direction of the axis. Thermal deformations of machine 
components can be inferred suitably for the circumstances 

where the machine tool is installed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine tool for
cutting, shaping, grinding, boring or polishing a workpiece
displacing a machining tool relatively to the workpiece. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a machine tool
equipped with a control system which is capable of correcting an
error in positioning due to thermal deformations of machine
components.In general, when a machine tool for cutting, shaping,
grinding, boring or polishing a workpiece, especially metal
workpiece into a desired profile, requires the accurate
positioning of a moveable element such as a machining tool or a
workpiece being machined, the workshop is maintained at a
constant temperature, for example, by means of an air conditioner
to prevent thermal deformations including thermal expansion and
contraction of machine components. Nevertheless, a machine body
of the machine tool may be wholly or partly affected by the heat
emitted by other machines installed nearby and the variation in
the outside temperature. Further, the machine body itself has
heat emitting parts which may cause thermal deformations of
machine components, which in turn may result in an error in
positioning a moveable element. It is difficult to accurately estimate and
correct such positioning error when thermal deformations
of a plurality of machine components such as a bed, a
column and a head cause the positioning error since the
magnitude of thermal deformation depends on the size and
material of a machine component and the directions of
thermal deformations may be different from each other.EP-A-0 138 375 discloses a machining apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1,
in which a programmed control system receives sensed
temperatures from temperature sensors and provides
correction signals based on these.An object of the present invention is to provide
a machine tool equipped with a control system which can
accurately correct an error due to thermal deformations of
machine components in positioning the moveable element
such as a machining tool and a workpiece to be machined.
Another object of the present invention is to
provide a machine tool equipped with a control system
which can infer thermal deformations of machine components
based on sensed temperatures of the machine components
suitably for the circumstances where the machine tool is
installed.Additional objects and advantages and novel
features of the invention will be set forth in part in the
description which follows, and in part will become
apparent to those skilled in the art
