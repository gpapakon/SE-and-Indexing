including a source of radiation (11) and a photodetector. The 

cell assembly is positionable between the radiation source and 
the photodetector and comprising a polymeric body having a bore 

therethrough with open ends and radiation tranparent windows 
with substantially flat surfaces respectively closing the ends 

of the bore and further having an inlet passage and an outlet 
passage opening into the bore respectively adjacent the 

opposite ends thereof for flowing fluid therethrough. The body 
is thermally insulating to the fluid flowing in the bore and 

has an outwardly facing annular surface defined on a protruding 
boss respectively encirculing each end of the bore 

approximately normal thereto and in contact with the 
corresponding substantially flat surface on the respective 

window. The cell assembly further comprises urging means for 
urging each respective transparent window against the 

respective protruding boss.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a detector cell assembly for
use in a spectrophotometer including a source of radiation and
a photodetector spaced from the source, the cell assembly being
positionable between the radiation source and the photodetector
and comprising a polymeric body having a bore therethrough
with open ends and radiation transparent windows with
substantially flat surfaces, respectively closing the ends of
the bore and further having an inlet passage and an outlet
passage opening into the bore respectively adjacent the
opposite ends thereof for flowing fluid therethrough.In the subject type of spectrophotometers for liquid
chromatography (LC) a substance_whose quantitative presence in a
sample is to be determined is dissolved in a suitable carrier
solvent, separated in an LC column and flowed through a detector
cell which has end windows through which ultraviolet or visible
light radiation is directed. Radiation exiting from the cell
falls on a photodetector whose output is recorded by suitable
instrumentation which is calibrated to indicate the amount of
radiation absorbed by the fluid flowing through the cell.
Absorbance is customarily indicated by a graph continuously
recorded on a strip chart by a pen recorder. The quantitative
presence of a substance of interest is determined by measuring
the area under the graph peaks which represent the amount of
radiation of a particular wavelength that is absorbed, particular
materials being identified by particular wavelengths
characteristically absorbed by them.The sensitivity of a spectrophotometer detector cell is a
function particularly of the stability of the base line of the
graph; the graph base line is established by the absorbance of
the solvent used, and will change in relation to any change in
the refractive index of the solvent, which in turn will be 
changed by a change in the temperature of the solvent in the
cell. When the baseline changes, the true peak area can not be
measured accurately and the peaks themselves become less clearly
defined and hence difficult to identify and measure with any
reliable degree of accuracy. The sensitivity of the instrument
which is rather limited in the best circumstance when the index
of refraction of the solvent remains constant (i.e. when flow
noise is at a minimum) is disproportionally reduced by any change
in temperatures of the solvent, thus altering its index of
refraction and increasing flow noise.U.S. Patent No. 4,192,614 discloses a spectrophotometer cell
assembly including a cell

<CLAIMS>
A detector cell assembly for use in a spectrophotometer including a
source of radiation (11) and a photodetector (14) spaced from the

source, the cell assembly (10) being positionable between the radiation
source and the photodetector and comprising:


a body (15) having a bore (12) therethrough with open ends and
radiation transparent windows (16, 17) with substantially flat surfaces

respectively closing the ends of the bore (12) and further having an inlet
passage (25) and an outlet passage (26) opening into the bore

respectively for flowing fluid therethrough, the body (15) being thermally
insulating to the fluid flowing in the bore (12), wherein the inlet passage

(25) and the outlet passage (26) openings are provided adjacent the
opposite ends of the bore (12), and
urging means (20) to effect a seal between the body (15) and the
respective transparent window (16, 17),

wherein the bore (12) comprises counterbores in the body (15) at each
end of the bore (12) and the bore (12) has a recessed annular surface

approximately normal thereto within the counterbores at each end of the
bore (12), and

wherein each window (16, 17) is fitted within a respective counterbore
and has a convex circumferential outer surface with a center of

curvature, and each urging means includes a bias means and a bushing
(19) having an inward flange surface (19a), the bushing (19) being 

movable in a plane approximately normal to the bore (12), the bias
means urging the inward flange surface (19a) to bear against the

convex outer circumferential surface of the window (16, 17) so as to
cause the bushing (19) to be centered on the window (16, 17), and 
so
as to provide radial forces directed toward the center of curvature such

as to uniformly distribute a sealing force between the window (16,17)
and an annular surface defined on a protruding boss (30, 31)

surrounded by respective recessed annular surface.
A detector cell assembly according to claim 1 wherein

the urging means (20) is such as to urge each transparent window (16,
17) with a force of between about 136N (30 pounds, 1.3 x 10
7
 dynes)
and about 180N (40 pounds, 1.8 x 10
7
 dynes),

each annular surface has a contact area on the respective transparent
window (16, 17) between about 0.038 cm
2
