<ABSTRACT>
Such an interface circuit makes it possible, from an input signal, varying between a reference level (VR) available on a first terminal (QR) and a first voltage level (V1), to deliver an output signal varying between this reference level (VR) and a second voltage level (V2) available on a second terminal (Q2). It includes two invertors (INV1, NV2) the response times of which are such that the two transistors of the third branch (P5, N6) are never active simultaneously. Thus, short-circuiting them during the transient regime does not create any current peak; it is therefore possible to dimension them substantially with respect to the other transistors of the circuit without degrading the efficiency thereof. Applications: interface circuits for heavy-current applications, and in particular voltage step-up circuits allowing low- and high-voltage circuits to be interfaced.

An interface circuit supplying an output signal, on the basis of a signal

terminal (QR) and a first voltage level (V1), which output signal varies between said 
reference level (VR) and a second voltage level (V2) such that the variation in the 

output signal is greater than or equal to that of the input signal, said second voltage 
level (V2) being available at a second terminal (Q2), and which circuit comprises: 


a first and a second branch, each comprising a first (P1, P3) and a second (N2, N4) 
transistor which are mutually complementary and which each have a first and a second 

main electrode and a control electrode, while the paths between the first main electrode 
and the second main electrode and between the second main electrode and the first main 

electrode are connected in series between said terminals (Q2, QR), the control 
electrodes of the first transistors of the first and the second branch (P1, P3) being

in that each inverter module (INV1, INV2) comprises two mutually complementary 

transistors which are dimensioned such that the response of the first inverter module 
(INV1) is on the one hand faster than that of the second (INV2) when the signal 

available at the input (E) of the interface circuit passes from the first voltage level (V1) 
to the reference level (VR), and on the other hand slower when this same signal passes 

from the reference level (VR) to the first voltage level (V1).
