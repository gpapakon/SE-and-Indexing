<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising a plurality of effective non-toxic dosage amounts of a composition for topical administration to the site of pathology and/or trauma of skin and/or exposed tissue of a human patient in need of treatment suffering from a disease or condition, each such dosage amount comprising a therapeutically effective non-toxic (to the patient) dosage amount of a drug for the treatment of the disease and/or condition of the skin and/or exposed tissue at the site of the pathology and/or trauma and an effective non-toxic dosage amount of hyaluronic acid and/or salts thereof and/or homologues, analogues, derivatives, complexes, esters, fragments, and/or sub-units of hyaluronic acid to transport (to facilitate or cause the transport of) the drug to the site of the pathology and/or trauma of the disease or condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of hyaluronic acid and/or salts thereof in the
manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of disease and
conditions of the skin and exposed tissue, for example, basal cell carcinoma,
squamous cell tumours, metastatic cancer of the breast to the skin, primary and
metastatic melanoma in the skin, malignancies and tumours in the skin, genital warts
(condyloma acuminata), cervical cancer, HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) including
HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) on the cervix, psoriasis (both plaque-type psoriasis
and nail bed psoriasis), corns on the feet, actinic keratoses lesions, "liver" spots,
fungal lesions, and other such types of lesions, and hair loss on the head of a
pregnant women.Basal cell carcinoma is presently treated by surgery. Each lesion, together
with all surrounding and underlying tissue (dermis, epidermis and subdermis), is cut
out. In some instances, surgery, while necessary for the patient's welfare, puts the
patient at risk in some other respect (for example, the removal of a lesion on a
patient's temple (resection) may jeopardize the patient's health). Squamous cell
tumours are also treated the same way as are other forms of cancer in the skin and
exposed tissue. Furthermore, other conditions and diseases of the skin and exposed
tissue are treated in the same way or in ways that cause discomfort to the patient, for
example, melanoma, genital warts, cervical cancer, HPV (Human Papilloma Virus).Actinic keratoses lesion is dealt with similarly. Liquid nitrogen is also used
to remove the lesion.These diseases and conditions are usually found in the epidermis (at least for
the most part, extending into the dermis and upwards through the Stratum
Corneum). Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring
glycosaminoglycan. Its molecular weight may vary from 50,000
daltons upwards, and it forms highly viscous solutions. As
regards the actual molecular weight of hyaluronic acid in
natural biological contexts, this is still a matter of much
uncertainty; when the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid is
to be determined, different values are obtained depending on
the assay method employed, and on the source, the isolation
method etc. The acid occurs in animal tissue, e.g. spinal
fluid, ocular fluid, synovial fluid, cockscombs, skin, and
also in some streptococci. Various grades of hyaluronic acid
have been obtained. A preparation with an allegedly high
degree of purity and alleged to be entirely free from side
effects, is a non-inflammatory form described in
