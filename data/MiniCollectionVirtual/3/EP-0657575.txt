<ABSTRACT>
A top-class low-noise washing machine (1) with motor operating speeds of 25 to 2,000 revolutions per minute is obtained, with a washing drum (7) arranged horizontally, in that the drive motor (11) mounted on the outside (22) of the tub rear wall (15) drives the washing drum (7) directly as a brushless motor and is surrounded by an insulating cover (13) which is fastened to the tub rear wall (15). By means of the washing machine according to the invention, noise-level values of 47 dB during washing and of 59 dB during spinning can be achieved without any high outlay.

<CLAIMS>
Automatic washing machine with a housing (3) in which is
arranged a mechanically oscillating unit which includes a

horizontally located wash drum (7), a tub (9) surrounding
the latter and a drive motor (11) which drives the wash

drum directly and which is mounted on the outer side (22)
of the tub rear wall (15), characterised in that the drive

motor is a brushless external rotor motor whose permanently
magnetic rotor (23) constructed as an external rotor

directly drives the drive shaft (24) of the wash drum (7),
and

an insulating hood (13) which is attached to the tub rear
wall (15) surrounds the drive motor (11).
Automatic washing machine according to claim 1,
characterised in that the tub rear wall (15) is provided

with an insulating layer (19) on its inner side (17).
Automatic washing machine according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the drive motor (11) is high-poled

and has a pole number 
>
 10.
Automatic washing machine according to claim 3,
characterised in that the drive motor (11) is a synchronous

motor with a frequency converter.
Automatic washing machine according to claim 3,
characterised in that the drive motor (11) is a reluctance

motor.
Automatic washing machine according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the insulating hood

(13) consists of a hollow cylinder (21) which is closed on 
one side by a bottom (20) and which closely surrounds the

external rotor (23) and whose opening edge (25) is rigidly
connected to the tub rear wall (15).
