<DESCRIPTION>
(Furan-2-yl )-2-(l normon-2-yl ) oxazole derivatives with antibacterial activityThe present invention relates to a class of compounds having antibacterial and antimycoplasmal activity, to processes for their preparation and to their use in human and veterinary medicine and also to intermediates for use in the preparation of such compounds.Compounds of the general formula (A):(A) in which the group R° represents an optionally substituted 5-membered heteroaryl ring containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, have been previously disclosed in EP-A-0 087 953 (Beecham Group pic) and EP-A-0 123 378 (Beecham Group pic) and will be recognised as derivatives of monic acid A in which the carboxylic acid group thereof has been replaced by the group R°. Such compounds were shown to have antibacterial and antimycoplasmal activity. Amongst the compounds of formula (A) described in EP-A-0 087 953 are examples in which the group R° is oxazolyl, substituted with a range of groups including substituted phenyl, substituted alkyl and thienyl. In addition EP-A-0 399 645 and WO-A- 91/09586 (Beecham Group pic) disclose compounds of formula (A) in which R° is an oxazol-2-yl group further substituted at position 5 by a furyl, isoxazolyl or pyridyl group. Surprisingly, it has now been found that with the 5- furyloxazol-2-yl compounds, there is a sub-class of compounds which have enhanced biological activity. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula(I):(I) in which R* represents a 2-nitro-furan-5-yl group which may be further substituted by up to two, preferably one, additional substituents and Zj_, Z2 

and Z3 which may be the same or different is each hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group. It will be appreciated that the group Rl may be represented by the sub-formula:Xxp in which Ra and R" each denote optional substituents. Suitable values forRa and ^ include, for example (Cι_6)alkyl and halogen. Preferably Rl is 5- nitro-furan-2-yl. When used herein, the term 'halogen' refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.Compounds of formula (I) may conveniently be named as '(1-normon-2-yl)oxazoles'. Normonyl is the trivial name for the 3-[(2S,3R,4R,5S)-5-[(2S,4S,5S)-2,3-epoxy-5-hydroxy-4-methylhexyl]-3,4-dihydroxy- tetrahydropyran-2-yl]-2-methylprop-l(E)-enyl radical, as shown in formula(II):(II) It will be appreciated that in compounds of formula (I), the chiral centres of the radical of formula (II) will have the same absolute configuration as the corresponding
