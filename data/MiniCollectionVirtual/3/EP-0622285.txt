A lightweight rail vehicle body comprising:

an underframe having a framework formed by two side sills (6,
7), two end sills (102), and load-bearing crosspieces (8);
a floor (1) of the underframe (2);
side faces (3, 4);
a roof (5);
two cantrails (9, 11) connecting said roof (5) to said side
faces (3, 4); and optionally
body ends;

in which body:
said two side sills (6, 7), said two end sills (102), said
load-bearing crosspieces (8) and said two cantrails (9, 11) are metal

elements; and
said floor (1) of the underframe (2), said side faces (3, 4),
said roof (5) and said body ends are elements that are mainly made of

composite material;

said body being characterized in that:
said floor (1) of the underframe (2), said side faces (3, 4),
said roof (5), and said body ends are one-piece elements.
A rail vehicle body according to claim 1, characterized in that
said two cantrails are connected together by metal end crosspieces.
A rail vehicle body according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that said elements that are mainly made of composite material are

secured to said metal elements via shaped section members (123, 124)
bordering the elements that are mainly made of composite material

(111, 112) and secured thereto.
A rail vehicle body according to claim 3, characterized in that
the metal shaped section members (123, 124) are secured to the

elements that are mainly made of composite material (111, 112) by
gluing. 
A rail vehicle body according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in
that the metal shaped section members are glued and bolted to the

metal elements.
A rail vehicle body according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in
that the metal shaped section members are glued and welded to the

metal elements.
A rail vehicle body according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that metal inserts (91 to 94) are provided in the

floor (1) in zones to be fixed to the load-bearing crosspieces.
A rail vehicle body according to claim 7, characterized in that
the inserts are made of steel.
A rail vehicle body according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that, on the outside of the body, the floor is

provided with local reinforcements (95, 96) for receiving supports
for equipment slung under the body.
A rail vehicle body according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the side faces are provided with local

reinforcements (17) serving to fix seats.
A rail vehicle body according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that said metal elements are made of aluminum.
