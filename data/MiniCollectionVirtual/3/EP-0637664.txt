<ABSTRACT>
A combination lock of the kind having an assembly (W) of gated tumbler wheels 
rotated by a lock dial shaft (114), and a fence lever (116) biased by a spring 

(120) towards an operative position in which, when the tumbler wheels are in 
a predetermined alignment, a nose (116') of the force lever (116) engages a 

slot (118') in a drive disc (118) to enable the bolt (124) to be withdrawn. A wire 
spring (140) is connected to the fence lever (116) and to a cam plate (130) 

slidable between a non-displaced position (Fig. 3) and a displaced position 
(Fig. 4). In the non-displaced position, the wire spring (140) exerts a force on 

the fence lever (116) which overcomes the force of its spring (120), and so 
holds the nose (116') of the fence lever (116) out of engagement with the drive 

disc (118). In the displaced position of the cam plate (130), the tension on the 
wire spring (140) is relieved, so that its force no longer overcomes that of the 

spring (120), which moves the fence lever (116) to its operative position. The 
cam plate (130) is held in the non-displaced position by a cam disc (126) 

associated with the drive disc (118), except for a brief period once during each 
revolution of the disc, when a cut-away segment (126') of the cam disc (126) 

engages a straight side (132") of an opening (132) in the cam disc. The nose 
(116') of the fence lever (116) therefore engages the drive disc (118) only 

momentarily once in each revolution of the disc, so preventing tampering of the 
lock by detecting engagements of the nose of the fence lever with the slot in 

the drive disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to combination locks. 
More particularly, the invention 
relates to tumbler scrambling manipulation combination locks, of the kind 
including a housing with a lock dial shaft rotatably mounted therein, a lock bolt 
movable in the housing, a fence lever pivotally coupled to the lock bolt, a 
spring means constantly urging the fence lever into an operative lock bolt 
displacing position thereof, an assembly of gated tumbler wheels rotatable by 
the lock dial shaft, and a slotted driver disc mounted on the tumbler wheel 
assembly, the fence lever being adapted to close against the said gated 
tumbler wheels when in alignment therewith and thereby enter its operative 
position to enable the displacement of the lock bolt by the fence lever. Such 
a combination lock is known from GB-A-735 148, which represents the closest prior art, and US-A-2 601 774. It has been recognised long ago that combination locks of this kind are liable 
to be tampered with by skilled manipulators, see for example Australian Patent 
No. 159 448 and United States Patent Nos. 3 991 596, 4 722 207 and 4 756 
176. The conceptually common solution proposed for rendering such locks 
"manipulation proof" was based on the idea of avoiding the sequential contact 
of the fence lever with the rotatable tumbler wheels, one at a time during 
dialling, which was thus indicative of the correct combination, namely allowing 
the snapping of the lever into engagement with all of the tumbler wheels upon 
completion of the combination. Various arrangements and mechanisms have thus been proposed, however 
of rather complicated design. It is an object of the invention to provide a more simple and straightforward 
solution to the above described problem. It is a further object of the invention to provide means adapted to be easily  
 
installed in most types of commercially available ordinary combination locks thereby 
rendering same manipulation protected. In accordance with this invention, there is provided an assembly comprising a 
displaceable cam plate coupled to a cam disc associated with the slotted driver 
disc and a second spring means coupled between the fence lever and the cam plate, 
and acting in opposition to the first spring means, the assembly operating such that 
on every revolution of the cam disc the cam plate is displaced thereby varying 
the tension in the second spring means so that the fence lever moves between a non-operative 
position when the cam plate is in its non-displaced position and an operative 
posit

A combination lock including a housing (112) with a lock dial shaft (114) 
rotatably mounted therein, a lock bolt (124) movable in the housing 

(112), a fence lever (116) pivotally coupled to the lock bolt (124), a 
spring means (120) constantly urging the fence lever (116) into an 

operative, lock bolt displacing position thereof, an assembly (W) of 
gated tumbler wheels (W1) rotatable by the lock dial shaft (114), and a 

slotted driver disc (118') mounted on the tumbler wheel assembly (W), 
the fence lever (116) being adapted to close against the said gated 

tumbler wheels (W) when in alignment therewith and thereby enter its 
operative position to enable the displacement of the lock bolt (124) by 

the fence lever (116), characterised by an assembly comprising a 
displaceable cam plate (130) coupled to a cam disc (126) 

associated with the slotted driver disc (118') and a second spring 
means (140) coupled between the fence lever (116) and the cam plate 

(130), and acting in opposition to the first spring means, the assembly 
operating such that on each revolution of the cam disc (126) the cam 

plate (130) is displaced thereby varying the tension in the second spring 
means (140) so that the fence lever (116) moves between a non-operative 

position when the cam plate is in its non-displaced position 
and an operative position when the cam plate (130) is in its displaced 

position depending on the balance of the forces exerted on the fence 
lever (116) by the first (120) and second (140) spring means. 
The combination lock as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the said second 
spring means (140) is a wire spring. 
The combination lock as claimed in Claim 2, in which the wire spring 
(140) has a first portion (140b) connected at one end (140a) to the 

fence lever (116) and a second portion (140c) connected at one end to  
 

the cam plate (130), the two portions (140b, 140c) being arranged at an 
angle to one another so that the spring (140) is in tension when the 

cam plate (130) is in the non-displaced position with the first portion 
(140b) portion (140b) biased to exert a force on the fence lever (116) 

which overcomes the force exerted by the first spring means (120), the 
tension of the spring (140) being at least partially relieved when the 

cam plate (130) is in the displaced position so that the force exerted by 
the first spring means (120) overcomes the force exerted on the fence 

lever (116) by the wire spring (140). 
The combination lock as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3 wherein the 
cam plate (130) is coupled to the cam disc (126) by an opening 

(132) of generally closed U-shape, the cam disc (126) being circular 
with a removed segment portion (126') engageable with the closed side 

(132") of the opening (132).
