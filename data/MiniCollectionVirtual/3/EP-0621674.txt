<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an actuator including power contacts for supplying a receiver. The actuator (10) further includes a mechanism (13) for control of the power contacts (11), this mechanism being actuated by an electromagnet (14). Between the power circuit for supplying the receiver (15) and the return power circuit, a measurement and a processing unit (18) is connected, arranged to measure the impedance at the terminals of the supply circuit (R) of the receiver. This unit is coupled to a contact (19) of the control circuit C. The contact (19) is arranged to cut off the supply from the control circuit in the event of a short-circuit of the supply circuit (R) of the receiver (15).
