<ABSTRACT>
A flat tube for a heat exchanger is disclosed. The flat tube is produced by assembling a main part (12) made of a folded metal strip defining a flat side (16), two rounded ends (18) and two side portions (20) with two free edges (22), as well as a secondary part (14) made of a metal strip forming a central portion (24) with two flanged free edges (26), whereby the secondary part (14) is sandwiched into the main part (12) to form a multichannel tube (30). The tube may be used in heat exchangers for motor vehicle heating and/or air conditioning systems.

A flat tube for a heat exchanger, of the type
comprising two opposed flat sides joined together by

two rounded sides and by two longitudinal internal
partitions to define flow ducts, characterised in that

the tube is formed by assembling and brazing two
complementary pieces which comprise:


a main piece (12) formed from a bent metal strip and
constituting a first flat side (16), the two rounded

sides (18) and two lateral segments (20), which are
connected to the two respective rounded sides (18) to

constitute part of the second flat side (32), the two
lateral segments (20) terminating in two respective

free edges (22) which are distant from each other and
bent toward the first flat side (16); and
a secondary piece (14) formed from a metal strip and
constituting a central segment (24) adapted to

constitute part of the second flat side (32), with the
central segment terminating in two free edges (26) bent

on the same side of the said central segment, so that
the two free edges (26) of the central segment can bear

against the free edges (22) of the lateral segments
(32) to hold the secondary piece (14) sandwiched in the

main piece (12), and so that the central segment (24) 
and the two lateral segments (32) together constitute

the second flat side (32) of the tube.
A flat tube according to Claim 1, characterised in
that each of the free edges (22) of the main piece (12)

is bent at right angles with respect to the
corresponding lateral segment (20), and terminates at a

distance from the first flat side (16) to define a gap
(i) of given size.
A flat tube according to Claim 2, characterised in
that each of the free edges (26) of the secondary piece

(14) is bent at right angles with respect to the
central segment (24) and terminates in a lip (28),

which is substantially parallel to the central segment
(24) and which is adapted to be inserted into a gap (i)

in the main piece (12).
A flat tube according to Claim 2 or Claim 3,
characterised in that the size of the gap (i) is

substantially equal to the thickness of the metal strip
from which the secondary piece (14) is formed.
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the main piece (12) and the

secondary piece (14) are obtained by successive rolling
operations.
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the metal strip from which the 

main piece (12) is formed is coated with a layer of
braze metal on one of its faces (FE) which extends

outwards.
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the metal strip from which the

secondary piece (14) is formed is coated with a layer
of braze metal on both of its faces (FE, FI).
