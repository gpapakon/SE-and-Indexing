<ABSTRACT>
The invention is used for a flexible floor covering which consists predominantly of plastic and is assembled from individual sections to form a large-surface-area structure, and the invention relates to the configuration of the joints of the individual interconnected sections. The invention aims to avoid a formation of joint gaps in the case of an assemblable floor covering which is made up of interconnected sections. The object of developing a deformation-resistant profile and a corner-point profiling for a mushroom-like edge profiling, which comprises teeth, of floor-covering sections has been achieved according to the invention in that the head part of each tooth is formed by a convex outer contour and the foot part is formed on both sides by a concave inner contour which corresponds, in terms of its curvature, to the convex outer contour and forms the lower boundary of the tooth spacing, there being provided, between the head part and foot part, a shaft part exhibiting a transition contour which connects the inner contour to the outer contour and is of a mirror-inverted formation with respect to a centre axis.

Plane-shaped, flexible floor covering consisting of
assemblable sections (1) with profile contoured edges

where each contoured edge (2) of a section (1) consists
of mushroom-shaped teeth (3,4) that interlock when the

sections (1) are installed, and each mushroom-shaped
tooth (3) of the teeth consists of a head (11), shaft

(12) and foot (13); there is a tooth gap (4) between the
individual teeth (3) of the contoured edges of the

sections (1), and a tooth (3) of a contoured edges (2)
of a neighboring section (1) locks in the gap when

installed, and the head (11) of each tooth (3) is
delimited by a convex outward contour (14), and the foot

(13) is on both sides delimited by an concave inward
contour (16), where the concave inward contour (16) by

the shape of its curving corresponds to the convex outward
contour (14) and forms the bottom edge of the tooth

gaps (4), where between the head (11) and foot (13)
there is a shaft (12), which has a transitional contour

(17) that connects the inward contour (16) with the
outward contour (14), and the transitional contour (17)

has a shape as if formed by mirror images along a
midaxis (15), 
characterized
 in that four sides of each
section (1) have profile contoured edges (2) of which

two at a time transition into a contact corners (7, 7'),
whereby two perpendicular profile contoured edges (2) of

the sections (1) form contact corners (7,7'), and the
contoured edges (2) formed by teeth (3) and teeth gaps

(4) have a final tooth (5) coming with a contact corner
(7,7') and a final tooth gap (6) with an unsymmetrical

shape. 
Plane-shaped, flexible floor covering according to claim
1, 
characterized
 in that the contact corner (7, 7') of
the final tooth (5) is delimited by two perpendicular

contour lines (9,10 and 9',10'), and one of the contour
lines (10,10') lies in the extension of one of the

diagonals of the sections (1).
Plane-shaped, flexible floor covering according to claim
1 and 2, 
characterized
 in that the convex outward
contour (14) of the head (11) of the final tooth (5) has

the curved shape of an ellipse, and the concave inward
contour (16) of the foot (13) of the final tooth gap (6)

encloses the curved shape of an ellipse.
