<ABSTRACT>
A process for the polymerization of ethylene and/or one or more alpha-olefins comprising contacting ethylene, and/or the alpha-olefin(s) with a catalyst comprising a first component which is a bis(cyclopentadienyl) Group IVA metal compound containing a substituent capable of reacting with a cation, and a second component which is a compound having a bulky anion containing one or more boron atoms and which is substantially non-coordinating under the reaction conditions and a cation, in which process further first component is added.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
the polymerization of olefins using a catalyst comprising
a bis(cyclopentadienyl) Group IVA metal
compound and a compound having a bulky anion
containing one or more boron atoms and a cation.Processes for the polymerization or co-polymerization
of ethylene and/or one or more alpha-olefins
comprising contacting the olefin(s) with a
catalyst comprising a first component which is a
bis(cyclopentadienyl) Group IVA metal compound
containing a substituent capable of reacting with a
cation, and a second component which is a compound
having a bulky anion containing one or more
boron atoms and which is substantially non-coordinating
under the reaction conditions and a cation,
are well known in the art. Such processes are the
subjects of EP-A-277003, EP-A-277004, EP-A-427696
and EP-A-443686. These processes are
suitable for preparing polymers having a high molecular
weight, as well as for preparing oligomers,
which are products with a relatively low molecular
weight, for example dimers, trimers and tetramers.
In the context of this patent application the term
"polymer" is therefore to be understood as to
include oligomers as well.Although the catalysts used in these processes
are very efficient polymerization catalysts, they
possess a disadvantage in that in the course of the
polymerization process the catalytic activity may
decline to an unacceptably low level, so that the
polymerization reaction times or run times are
short, for example up to only a few hours. Thus,
the catalysts have a limited life-time and need to
be discarded after having been used, because regeneration
processes for the catalysts are not available.
The disposal of used catalyst may contribute
to environmental problems associated with the
polymerisation process. In addition, the catalysts
comprise complex, high-value chemicals so that
the catalyst costs may contribute considerably to
the total costs of the polymerization process. It is
therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a process in which a more economic use
of at least one of the catalyst components can be
made.It has now been found that when in a polymerization
reaction mixture the activity of the catalyst
has declined to a low level the activity can
substantially be restored by adding a further quantity
of the first catalyst component. By this finding it
is possible to make a more efficient use of the
second catalyst component, because, for example,
remnants thereof can be (re-)used by adding thereto
first catalyst
