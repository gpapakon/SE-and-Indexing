<ABSTRACT>
A thermal print fixing station for electrophotographic printing devices contains a heating roller (12) with a core of heat-conductive material which is surrounded, at least in a contact region with the substrate (11), by a heat-resistant, toner-repellant coating (16) of PTFE. 10 to 25% wt of graphite particles are embedded in the coating (16). A pressure roller (14) spring-loaded against the heating roller (12) has an elastic outer coating. There is a cleaning device with a doctor roller (20) and doctor blade (22), separate from a lubrication device (19), to remove particles of dirt adhering to the heating roller (12).

Apparatus for the thermal print fusing of toner 
images (10) on a recording medium (11) of a printer or 

copier operating by the transfer printing method, having 

a heating roller (12) which has a core (15) of a 
thermally conductive material, which core is sheathed, at 

least in a contact region with the recording medium (11), 
with a thermally conductive surface coating (16) of 

polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with a coating thickness 
of 100 µm - 500 µm which contains about 15 per cent by 

weight of incorporated graphite particles of high-purity 
carbon in crystalline form, and having 
a nipping roller (14) assigned to the heating roller 
(12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the 
nipping roller (14) is designed to be elastic at least in 

its contact region with the recording medium (11). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
wherein the nipping roller (14) is of multi-layer structure 

with a basic layer made of silicone and an oil-repellent 
covering layer. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
having a cleaning device which is assigned to the heating 

roller (12) and has a sealing roll (20), which is supported 
on the heating roller (12), picks up dirt and has 

an associated dirt collection container (21), and a 
separate oiling device (19) for applying lubricant to the 

heating roller (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, having a dirt 
scraping element (22) arranged downstream of the sealing 

roll (20) in the direction of movement of the heating 
roller (12). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 4 or 5, 
wherein at least the surface of the sealing roll (20) 

consists of porous material which picks up dirt. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
having a cleaning device which is assigned to the nipping 

roller (14) and has a cleaning element (23) made of  
 

porous material resting on the nipping roller (14) and a 
dirt scraping element (24), disposed upstream of the 

cleaning element (23) in the direction of movement of the 
nipping roller (14), with an associated dirt collection 

container (25). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
having a device (27) which, if required, is assigned to 

the nipping roller (14) and conducts electric charges 
away. 
Method for producing a heating roller (22) 
according to Claim 1, having the following steps: 


peeling off the surface coating (16) from a pressed 
part in the form of a film; 
sticking the film onto the roller core (15); 
setting the precise coating thickness by material-removing 
measures in accordance with the desired roller 

contour.
