<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazines, compositions containing them,
processes for making them and their use in the treatment of carcinomas, particularly ovarian
carcinomas.Trimelamol [2,4,6-tris{(hydroxymethyl) (methyl) amino)-1,3,5-triazine] is clinically active,
particularly against ovarian carcinomas, but its clinical development has been halted due to
difficulties with formulation due to instability with respect to the formation of dimers during
formulation. It has been established that the half-life of trimelamol activity in humans is
short and that may limit its clinical efficacy (I.R. Judson, et al Cancer Res. 49, 5475-5479,
1989). We believe that this is, in part, due to the chemical instability of the N-hydroxymethyl
functions resulting in the release of formaldehyde. We have investigated
reducing the number of N-hydroxymethyl functions and stabilizing these functions using
electron-withdrawing organic groups (defined in the present context as electron-withdrawing
relative to methyl), with a view to lengthening the half-life and also improving amenability
to formulation, for example in aqueous solutions.Accordingly this invention provides novel 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazines having the following
general formula:

wherein each R1 which may be the same or different, is C1-4 alkyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl
or propargyl and R2 is hydrogen. 
It is preferred that all three R1 groups, when
alkyl, are all methyl.The organic groups -CH2CF3 and -CH2Câ‰¡CH are electron-withdrawing. Because of
the greater stability conferred on such compounds by the presence of such electron
withdrawing substituents, which may constitute in lengthening the half-life and also in
improving amenability to formulation, they may be prepared by allowing tris-hydroxymethyl
compounds or precursors thereof to decompose in aqueous organic media and separating from
the mixture of products (see Fig. 1) thus generated the appropriate compounds of the present
invention, for example by chromatography on silica gel.We have found that these new analogues of trimelamol have a similar level of activity against
carcinomas, particularly ovarian carcinomas, as trimelamol, but are more stable and do not
form dimers and polymers and thus are more amenable to formulation.The compounds of the present invention are also prepared via intermediate compounds
of the general formula:

wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above for the formula IThe intermediates are prepared by reacting a cyanuric halide of general formula:
