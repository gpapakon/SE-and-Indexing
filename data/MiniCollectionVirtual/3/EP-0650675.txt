<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel stick for mountain climbers, which is fitted with a device for braking and power dissipation between the handle (1) and fitted-on tube (5). Specifically, the stick consists of two telescopic tubes (4, 5). The handle (1) is fitted onto one of these tubes while lever systems controlled from the handle actuate the expansion device (7) which influences the sliding movement between the two telescopic tubes.

<CLAIMS>
Supporting stick to be used as a walking aid, comprising a 
fixed tube (4) secured to a handle (4) and a telescopic tube (5) 

mounted in said fixed tube (4) to be coaxially shifted therein, 
in said fixed tube (4) being mounted a brake means connected to 

an actuating lever (2) pivotally attached to the handle (1), 
characterised in that the brake means consists of a friction 

brake (7) mounted in said fixed tube (4) and acting against the 
inner wall of said telescopic tube (5), the braking intensity 

being controlled by a definite and determined manual grasping of 
the handle (1) and of the actuating lever (2), such that, during 

the way down, the stick is substituting the muscular braking 
force. 
Supporting stick according to claim 1, wherein the friction 
brake (7) consists of an axially slotted spreader ring within 

which a tapered expanding plug (9) is axially movable, said plug 
being linked to said actuating lever (2) by means of a tie wire 

(6). 
Supporting stick according to claim 2, wherein the lower end 
of a back pressure spring (8) abuts on the expanding plug (9), 

whereas the upper end of said spring engages against a stop ring 
(4) secured in the fixed tube (4).
