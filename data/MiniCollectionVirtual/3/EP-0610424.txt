<ABSTRACT>
Compositions of difluoromethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane are useful as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, expansion agents for polymers such as polyolefins and polyurethanes, and as power cycle fluids. Near azeotropic compositions comprise admixtures of effective amounts of difluoromethane and tetrafluoroethane to form a near azeotropic composition. Such compositions are useful as refrigerants, cleaning agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and polyurethanes, refrigerants, aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, power cycle working fluids, polymerization media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, and displacement drying agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions of fluorinated
hydrocarbons and more specifically to compositions that comprise difluoromethane
and tetrafluoroethane. As used herein, tetrafluoroethane includes 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane,
or 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane, or mixtures thereof. Such
compositions are useful as cleaning agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and
polyurethanes, refrigerants, aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous
dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, power cycle working fluids, polymerization
media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, and
displacement drying agents. These compositions are potentially environmentally
safe substitutes for Refrigerant-22, a commercial refrigerant.Concern over the ozone depletion potential of certain halocarbons
has resulted in a search for alternative compounds having lower ozone depletion
potentials. Recently the long-term environmental effects of chlorofluorocarbons
and even hydrochlorofluorocarbons have come under substantial scientific scrutiny,
because it has been postulated that these materials decompose in the stratosphere,
under the influence of ultraviolet radiation, to release chlorine atoms. Chlorine
atoms are theorized to undergo chemical reaction in the stratosphere, which could
deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, which shields the earth from harmful
ultraviolet radiation. A substantial reduction of stratospheric ozone could have a
serious deleterious impact on the quality of life on earth.There is a continuing need in this art for new materials having new
combinations of properties for use in the aforementioned applications. In view of
the potential environmental problem associated with stratospheric ozone depletion,
there is a particular need for new materials possessing properties which make them
useful in the subject applications and which are also potentially environmentally
safe.There is a limit to the number of single fluorinated hydrocarbon
substances which could be candidates as environmentally safe materials. Mixtures 
of known materials, however, might be used if the desired combination of properties
could be found in a given mixture. Also, certain types of compositions can be
formulated that are quite useful due to the temperature glide created through the
heat exchangers, that is, the difference in the inlet and outlet temperatures of heat
exchangers. These compositions exhibit novel properties that can be useful in
increasing the energy efficiency of refrigeration
