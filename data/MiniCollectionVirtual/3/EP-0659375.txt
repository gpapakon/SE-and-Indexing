<ABSTRACT>
A free-standing bottle support (1) for supporting a 
bottle in a substantially horizontal attitude above a 

horizontal support surface upon which the support (1) is stood, 
which support (1) has a head portion (6) rigidly connected to a 

base portion (7), the head portion (6) 
comprising means (8,9,10) for 

receiving and retaining a neck of the bottle, which bottle 
support (1) is characterised in that the base portion (7) has a 

curved contact face (11) for resting on the support surface when 
the support is stood on the support surface, the 

arrangement being such that the head portion (6) supports the 
bottle in a balanced condition with the centre of gravity 

of the assembly of support and bottle above the curved 
contact face (11) for a range of positions of the neck of the 

bottle relative to the receiving and 
retaining means (8,9,10) of the 

head portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a free-standing 
bottle support for receiving and supporting an individual 
bottle in a balanced manner. A known free-standing bottle support for supporting 
and displaying an individual bottle in a substantially 
horizontal attitude above a support surface is made from a 
curved wooden stave of a wine barrel which is cut to an 
appropriate length. Near one end, the stave is provided 
with a through hole which extends between the two major 
surfaces of the stave and is dimensioned to receive the 
neck portion of a bottle to be supported. The other end of 
the stave is cut at an angle to the major surfaces of the 
stave to form an end face upon which the bottom support 
carrying the bottle is balanced on end on the support 
surface. Such a known bottle support is illustrated in 
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings and is disclosed for example in AU-B-614258. 
Clearly for this configuration to balance, the centre of gravity of the 
assembly of the bottle and the bottle support must be 
almost directly above the end face. However, to achieve 
the balanced condition, it is usually necessary to "fine 
tune" the position of the bottle neck within the through 
hole since, if the neck is placed too far forward or 
rearward of the balanced position, then the bottle support 
will topple over due to the moment exerted about the end 
face. The present invention seeks to provide a bottle 
support which overcomes the above mentioned problem. Accordingly, the present invention provides a 
free-standing bottle support for supporting a bottle in a 
substantially horizontal attitude above a horizontal 
support surface upon which the support is stood, which  
 
support has a head portion rigidly connected to a base 
portion, in which support the head portion comprises means 
for receiving and retaining a neck of the bottle, the base 
portion has a curved contact face for resting on the 
support surface when the support is stood on the support 
surface, the arrangement being such that the head portion 
supports the bottle in a balanced condition with the centre 
of gravity of the assembly of support and bottle above the 
curved contact face for a range of positions of the neck of 
the bottle relative to the receiving and retaining means of 
the head portion. In order that the invention may be more readily 
understood, an embodiment thereof will now be described, by 
way of example, with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:
