<ABSTRACT>
A multi-plate mould, having a plurality of mould cavities and a hot-runner manifold block for the injection-moulding of multilayered mouldings, such as for example preforms from PET. For this purpose there is fastened on a machine plate (9) a head plate (13), which is releasably connected to a hot-runner plate (14), which contains a hot-runner manifold block (15), and a plurality of hot-runner nozzles (25). Releasably fastened on this hot-runner plate (14) is a female-mould plate (12), with a male-mould plate (16) which can be displaced with respect to this female-mould plate (12) and along fixed guide pillars (11) and which comprises a base plate (17), a stripper plate (18) and a slide plate (19), the male-mould plate (16) bearing a plurality of mould cores (27), releasably connected to the base plate (17), around each of which cores there is fitted a male mould (29), which with the corresponding female mould (28) of the female-mould plate (12) forms a mould cavity (26) for the moulding. The hot-runner manifold block (15) is made from a piece of metal, has on the machine side at least two, preferably equal-length and correspondingly dimensioned runners (30) for the feeding of different material components and includes means for stabilising the temperature in the hot-runner manifold block (15) and in the individual hot-runner nozzles (25). A pneumatic needle valve arrangement (36) serves for releasing or shutting off the individual material components.

<CLAIMS>
A multi-plate moulding tool having a plurality of
moulding cavities and a hot channel distribution

block for injection moulding multilayer preforms,
in particular for blow-stretchable preforms made of

PET, comprising a head plate (13) attached to a
fixed machine plate (9), characterized in that this

moulding tool comprises a hot runner plate (14)
being removably connected to said head plate

(13),said hot runner plate (14) comprising a hot
channel distribution block (15) and a plurality of

hot channel nozzles (25), with a lower die plate
(12) being removably attached to said hot runner

plate (14), with an upper die plate (16) being
movable to said lower die plate (12) along fixed

guide columns (11), said upper die plate (16) comprising
a base plate (17), a stripping plate (18)

and a slide plate (19), whereby the upper die plate
(16) bears a plurality of form cores (27) being

removably connected to the base plate (17), around
each said form core (27) an annular stamp (29) is

arranged, which annular stamp is attached to said
slide plate (19), said annular stamp (29) comprising

an exterior surface which is conically tapered
towards the lower die plate (12), and which, when

the forming tool (4) is closed, lies in close fit
with a mating opposite surface of a die (28) of the

lower die plate (12), thereby forming the desired
moulding cavity (26), said hot channel distribution

block (15) being a monolithic metal block, in which
on the machine side there are arranged at least two

channels (30) for infeeding different material
components, means being provided for stabilizing

the temperature in the hot channel distribution

block and in each of the hot channel nozzles (25),
and having a pneumatic needle closure arrangement 

(36) for selectively releasing or blocking the
different material components.
Multi-plate moulding tool according to claim 1,
characterized in that the closely fitting conical

surfaces of the stamp and the die are pressed
against each other with a closing pressure of

around 350 Tons when the form tool is closed.
Multi-plate moulding tool according to claim 1,
characterized in that the deviation in the distance

between the conical surfaces of the stamp and the
die is less than 5/1000 mm.
Multi-plate moulding tool according to claim 1,
characterized in that in the hot channel distribution

block the channels (30) branch out in a predetermined
geometrical pattern and that for a certain

material component these branch channels lie on a
plane which is parallel to the plane of the plate

for a certain material component.
Hot channel distribution block according to claim
4, characterized in that the distance between the

inlet opening on the machine side and the outlet
opening on the nozzle side in the hot channel distribution

block (15) is the same for each channel
(30).
Hot channel distribution block according to claim
5, characterized in that the diameter of each channel

is adapted to the conveying rate of each component
for the respective layers of the multi layer

preforms.
Multi-plate moulding tool according to claim 4,
whereby in the hot channel distribution block there 

is arranged a hot channel nozzle with a needle
closure arrangement (36) for releasing and/or closing

off individual material components in the area
of the nozzle tip of the nozzle body (34) by means

of a movable needle (37), said needle closure arrangement
(36) comprising a first piston (38) which

activates the needle (37), over which first piston
a second piston (39) is arranged, said pistons (38,

39) being inserted in a cavity in the cold head
plate (13), said cavity acting as a pneumatic cylinder,

and pressure lines (41, 43 and 44) being
provided, via which a pressure medium can be selectively

introduced into or expelled from the pneumatic
cylinder, in order to bring the individual

pistons into their appropriate releasing or closing
positions.
Multi-plate moulding tool according to claim 7,
whereby the needle closure arrangement for the hot

channel nozzle (34) is provided with a first piston
(38) actuating the needle (37), over which first

piston a second piston (39) is arranged, said pistons
(38, 39) being inserted in a cavity in the

cold head plate (13) which cavity has a cylinder
covering (40), said cavity acting as a pneumatic

cylinder, and pressure lines (41, 43 and 44) being
provided, via which a pressure medium can be selectively

introduced into or expelled from the pneumatic
cylinder in such a manner that the first piston

(38) can move the needle (37) into appropriate
nozzle (34) releasing or closing positions, characterized

in that a gas-tight axial seal is provided
between the nozzle (34) and the piston arrangement

(38, 39).
