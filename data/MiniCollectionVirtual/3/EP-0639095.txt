<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an improved toy building element (10) having at least one protuberance (15) on its planar upper face (11), the protuberance (15) having a ridge (18) extending circumferentially therearound, and at least one downwardly opening cavity (21) on the underside of the element, each cavity (21) having an internal circumferential groove (20), and convexly curved end walls (14), arranged and constructed so that when two like elements are to be joined together the or each protuberance (15) is press fitted within a respective cavity (21) with the ridge (18) engaging within an associated groove (21) to thereby interlock the elements together, the elements, when thus interlocked, being able to swivel relative to one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a toy building element which 
incorporates a block having semi-circular curved ends and 
releasable engagement means which allows other like blocks 
relative rotation about an axis of the engagement means. The prior art of toy building elements, and in particular 
blocks, has many examples of block design which include 
substantially rectangular blocks with protrusions of 
cylindrical and other shapes that engage with an interference 
fit, into complementary cavities, located in the bases of 
similar blocks. This configuration allows blocks to be 
placed together in various combinations dependent upon the 
configuration of the protrusions and cavities used. A well known example is a product produced by the company 
Interlego A.G. and sold under the Registered Trade Mark 
"Lego". In one of its most basic aspects, a block has 
parallel sides, parallel top and bottom surfaces, 
cylindrically shaped protuberances projecting from its top 
surface and cavities for location of similar protuberances in 
its underside. Each of the blocks has identical 
configuration of protuberances and cavities and the blocks 
are capable of being interconnected, bottom to top or vice 
versa, the protuberances and internal cavities, when the 
blocks are thus interconnected, releasably engaging one 
another. The blocks can be disengaged and one or both of the blocks 
can be rotated about an axis which is normal to the top and 
bottom of the block and the block can then be re-engaged. 
This manipulation is possible as a direct result of the 
configuration of the protuberances and cavities thereon. The Interlego A.G. range of toy building elements is shaped 
and configured in a multiplicity of ways but the common 
engagement means is by interference fit of a cylindrical 
protuberance into a complementary cavity.  
 Other toy building elements exist that utilise ridges and 
reciprocal cavities on the top, bottom and also sides of the 
block as evidenced by examples in U.S. 3905150, 
DE 1603304 and AU 86/51923. The prior art of toy building blocks that require 
interference fit engagement means rely on the frictional 
strength and stability of the coupled blocks. This has the 
disadvantage of reliance on a single protuberance and cavity 
in some cases. In other configurations of the construction 
of items with the abovementioned blocks, there is no rotation 
of the interconnected blocks, one with respect to the other, 
lest the interference fit twists itself out of frictional 
engagement. It is an object of

<CLAIMS>
A toy building element comprising a hollow block (10) having 
a closed upper end (11), an open lower end (12), and a peripheral side 

wall (13,14) interconnecting the upper and lower ends, at least one 
protuberance (15) projecting from said upper end at least one 

downwardly opening cavity (21) extending inwardly from the open 
lower end of the block, the or each protuberance having a 

circumferential ridge (18), and the or each cavity having an 
internal circumferential groove (20), the blocks being dimensioned 

and shaped such that, when two like elements are joined 
together, the or each protuberance (15) is press fitted within a 

respective said cavity (21) with the ridge (18) engaging within an 
associated said groove (20) to thereby interlock the elements 

together, with the elements being rotatable relative to one 
another about an axis common to both the cavity (21) and the 

protuberance (15) engaged therein. 
A toy building element according to claim 1 wherein said 
block is approximate
ly oval shaped and has two said 
protuberances and two said cavities, wherein the peripheral 

side wall includes a pair of opposed parallel side wall 
portions and a pair of opposite end wall portions, wherein 

said end wall portions are convexly curved, with each said 
protuberance being disposed at approximately the centre of 

curvature of a respective said curved end wall portion 
adjacent thereto. 
A toy building element according to claim 2 wherein each 
said end wall portion is provided with a recess or slot 

extending inwardly from its lower end for engagement by a 
release tool for assisting the separation of the blocks when 

joined together. 
A toy building element according to claim 1 wherein the 
block is circular in plan and is provided with a single 

protuberance centrally located on the upper end of the block,  
 

and a single said cavity centrally located and extendingly 
inwardly of the open bottom end of the block and being 

coaxially aligned with said single protuberance. 
A toy building element according to claim 4 further 
comprising a plurality of further cylindrically shaped 

protuberances projecting laterally outwardly from the 
circular peripheral wall of the block and spaced 

circumferentially therearound, each said further protuberance 
having a circumferential ridge extending around its 

cylindrical wall. 
A toy building element according to claim 4 or claim 5 
further comprising a plurality of circumferentially spaced 

cylindrical cavity forming walls projecting laterally 
outwardly from the cylindrical side wall of the block and 

defining further cylindrical cavities for receiving, with a 
press-fit, protuberances of another toy building element. 
A toy building element according to claim 6 wherein 
there is a pair of said further protuberances and a pair of 

said further cylindrical cavities, the protuberances and 
cavities of each said pair being diametrically opposite one 

another. 
A toy building element according to claim 1 wherein each 
of the protuberances has a cylindrical side wall.
