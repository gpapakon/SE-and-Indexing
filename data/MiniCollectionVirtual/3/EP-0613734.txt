<ABSTRACT>
Method for cleaning and in particular degreasing optical fibres (6) protruding from the stripped end of the sheath of a cable (5), surrounding in particular a plurality of such fibres protected by a grease-based material or the like. According to the invention, this method is characterised in that it consists in using a liquid solvent (13) which is applied to the outer surface of the fibre in the form of a foam consisting of a solvent-air mix which increases the area of contact between the fibre and the solvent. The invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out this method.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the cleaning and, in particular, the 
degreasing of optical fibres (6) emerging from the end 

of a cable (5) stripped of the sheath, the sheath 
surrounding, notably, a plurality of such fibres 

protected by a grease-based or analogous material, 
characterized in that it consists of using a liquid 

solvent (13) applied onto the outer surface of the fibre 
in the form of a lather, constituted of a mixture of 

solvent and air, increasing the contact surface of the 
fibre and of the solvent. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
solvent used is, in known manner, a product based upon 

petroleum or a derivative of the latter. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
solvent is a liquid chemical product having degreasing 

properties, such as trichloroethylene. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the liquid solvent is finely 

divided and emulsified by continuous injection of a 
pressurized air flow supplied into the body of the 

liquid, the lather formed being disposed above the level 
of this liquid. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the fibres to be degreased are 

dipped into the lather, above the liquid level, the air 
injection causing a continuous stirring of this lather 

in contact with the fibres. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,  
 

characterized in that a final step is carried out 
comprising a drying of the cleaned fibres for the 

purpose of removing the excess lather remaining on the 
surface of the fibres.
