<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for combining a first 
digital generated image and one or more prestored 

digital images. The system include means for selecting 
one of the prestored digital images for and the steps 

of selecting an output format for printing the first 
digital generated image and the selected prestored 

image, providing the first digital generated image, 
combining the first digital generated image with the 

selected prestored digital image such that the 
generated image is placed in the predetermined location 

so as to form a merged image in accordance with the 
requirements of the selected output format, and for 

printing out the merged image in a desired format.

<DESCRIPTION>
A system and method are disclosed for
producing images which include a merging between customer generated and pre-stored images by merging at least two
images obtained from different sources and imprinting
the merged image on at least one output format from a
plurality of output forms that are available. This
application is related to and continues subject matter
disclosed in prior copending Buckley et al, U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 07/602,439, filed October 22,
1990, which was related to and continued prior
copending, U.S. Patent Application Serial
No. 07/282,013 which issued as US-A-5,036,472,
and Banks et al, U.S. Patent Application
Serial No. 07/514,670, filed April 25, 1990. This
application is also related to and continues subject
matter disclosed in prior copending Buckley et al, U.S.
Patent Application Serial No. 07/876,389, filed April
30, 1992, which was a divisional application of prior
copending Buckley et al, U.S. Patent Application Serial
No. 07/735,985, filed July 25, 1991, which was a
division of prior U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
07/282,013 which issued as US-A-5,036,472 on July 30,
1991.Applicants' related application
07/282,013, now US-A-5,036,472, discloses
examples of personalized greeting cards and the
production of those cards. Designs have also been 
imprinted on various other articles such as hats,
notebook covers, signs, bumper stickers, umbrellas,
cloth, or canvas items, cups, coffee mugs,
certificates, key chains, balloons, buttons, business
cards, and other custom designed items. For instance,
US-A-4,873,643 discloses the imprinting of
designs by a customer using an apparatus which has a
central processing unit (computer) programmed with
design rules that restrict the placement and size of
certain print design elements to assist the customer in
providing the customized imprinted articles.In addition, EP-A-0 326 515 has addressed
imprinting, or transferring of a complex image which
has been obtained from the merging of a video/photo
image into a decorative background and printing the
complex image onto an ordinary blank card.A problem sometimes associated with previously
available systems is that they have been limited either
by the number of output formats, or in the type of
input that may be provided, or in artifacts resulting
from the merger of image data. While the GB-A-2,246,929
and EP-A-0 326 515 publications disclose the use of
digital photographic images with other prestored
images, there is no adjustment provided with regard to
the quality of the image
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of combining a first digital generated image and one or more
prestored digital images (70), each of said prestored digital images having at

least one predetermined location (51, 52, 53, 54, 55,) wherein said first digital
generated image is to be placed, one of said prestored digital images being first

selected, the method comprising the steps of:

a) providing a plurality of different output devices (32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42)
