<ABSTRACT>
A head in which a 
forward side electrode is stacked on at least the surface of a 

magnetic reluctance effect element (6) facing a magnetic recording 
medium, and in which an upper magnetic pole (5) is stacked on the 

forward side electrode (7) for facing the magnetic reluctance effect 
element. A connecting length (L1) between the magnetic reluctance 

effect element and the forward side electrode is shorter than a 
facing length (L2) over which the upper magnetic pole and the 

magnetic reluctance effect element face each other via a magnetic 
gap (G). The upper magnetic pole and the magnetic reluctance 

effect element have an area in which the upper magnetic pole and 
the magnetic reluctance effect element face each other over a 

distance (g2) larger than a magnetic gap length (g1) of the magnetic 
gap (G). The upper magnetic pole may be formed for being 

progressively spaced apart from the magnetic reluctance effect 
element by being angled 30° relative to the magnetic reluctance 

effect element, and the distance (g2) may be progressively 
increased. With the magnetic reluctance effect magnetic head, 

the playback output may be improved and the magnetic head may be 
reduced in size and in the power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic reluctance effect
magnetic head and, more particularly, to an improvement in a
connection structure of a forward side electrode.A magnetic reluctance effect magnetic head employed in, for
example, a playback magnetic head in, for example, a hard disc
drive device, referred to herein as an MR head, comprises a lower
magnetic pole 51 on which a magnetic sensitive area 53 is formed
via a first insulating film 52 and an upper magnetic pole 55
formed on the magnetic sensitive area 53 via a second insulating
film 54, as shown in Fig.1. The magnetic sensitive area 53 is
made up of a magnetic reluctance effect element 56, referred to
herein as a MR element, having a forward side electrode 57
towards a surface 60 facing a magnetic recording medium and a
rear electrode 58 on the opposite-side, and a bias conductor 59
provided traversing the MR element 56 at right angles thereto for
affording a bias magnetic field to the MR element 56 in a pre-set
direction. A second insulating film 54 is interposed between the
MR element 56 and the bias conductor 59.With this type of the MR head, the upper magnetic pole 55
is thickened in the vicinity of the surface 60 facing the
magnetic recording medium and the distance between the upper
magnetic pole 55 and the lower magnetic pole 51 becomes narrow
towards the surface 60 facing the magnetic recording medium. A 
terminal end portion 55a of the upper magnetic pole 55 and a
terminal end portion 51a of the lower magnetic pole 51 face the
MR element 56 via magnetic gap areas G1 and G2 each having a certain gap
width. The terminal end portion 55a of the magnetic pole 55 is
connected to a terminal electrode 57, with a connecting length
L1 of the MR element 56 to a terminal electrode 57 directly being
the depth of the magnetic gap. That is, the connecting length L1
of the MR element 56 with the terminal electrode 57 is set so as
to be equal to the length L2 over which the terminal end portion
55a of the upper magnetic pole 55 faces the MR element 56 via the
magnetic gap area G1 having a gap length g1.For reproducing the information by the above-described MR
head, the sense current is supplied to the MR element 56 from the
forward side electrode 57 and the rear electrode 58, while a bias
magnetic field is applied to the MR element 56 for magnetizing
the MR element 56 in a pre-set direction. When the stray
magnetic flux is supplied from the magnetic recording medium to
the MR element 56, the direction of magnetization of the MR
element is rotated due
