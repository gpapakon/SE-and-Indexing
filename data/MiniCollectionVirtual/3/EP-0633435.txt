<ABSTRACT>
A condenser for air-conditioning systems, 
particularly for motor vehicles, comprising a group 

of tubes (14) secured to a pack of substantially 
flat fins (16) by means of mechanical expansion of 

the tubes (14) following their insertion in holes 
aligned in the fins (16).

 
The tubes (14) have an oblong cross-section 

without any flat walls, with a ratio of between 
2.5 and 3.75 between the maximum dimension (b) and 

the minimum dimension (a) of the cross-section, 
and a ratio of between 15 and 30 between the 

maximum dimension (b) of the cross-section and the 
thickness (s) of the tube (14); and in that the 

ratio between the distance between the fins (p) 
and the thickness of each fin (t) is less than or 

equal to 11.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air 
conditioning system, in particular for motor 
vehicles. More precisely, the invention relates to a 
condenser of the type defined in the preamble of the 
Claim. In the motor vehicle field, the working 
conditions of a condenser may be rather harsh, 
especially in terms of operating temperature and 
pressure. Frequently, the internal pressure of the 
tubes, on the Freon side, reaches values of more 
than 25 bar and temperatures of more than 120Â°C; 
when pressures of this type reach values of more 
than 27 - 28 bar, proposed protective systems 
provide for the uncoupling of the compressor from 
the mechanical drive and thus switch off the air 
conditioning system. Supply specifications generally require that 
the condenser should not be subjected to permanent 
deformations in any part with pressures inside the 
tubes and the distributors of the order of 30 bar 
(test pressure), whilst the condenser should not  
 
burst at pressures equal to twice the test 
pressure (approximately 60 bar). Such harsh working conditions have forced 
condenser manufacturers to develop essentially two 
different techniques for the construction of the 
heat exchanger portion of the condenser. These two 
construction techniques concern the methods of 
constructing the so-called core of the condenser, 
that is, the heat exchanging part formed of tubes 
and fins. These techniques are:- 
mechanical enlargement or expansion; and braze welding. In expanded or mechanically assembled 
condensers, the heat exchanger network consists of 
round tubes, made of copper or aluminium, and of 
flat fins generally made of aluminium and, more 
rarely, of copper. The tubes are inserted in the 
holes in the fins and are successively deformed 
plastically by means of a suitable expansion tool 
which increases the diameter of the tubes, such 
that the initial play between the tubes and the 
holes in the fin is taken up. At the end of the 
expansion step, a radial interference between the 
tubes and fins of the order of 0.1 - 0.2 mm is 
obtained. The final expansion of the tube is  
 
considered to be correct when, in addition to the 
plastic deformation of the tube, elastic 
deformation of the fins is obtained, such that 
stable and efficient contact between the two parts 
is ensured. The characteristic components of this 
construction process are: 
structural simplicity; simplicity of the process; reliability; low investment costs; and low cost of the final product. Braze-welded condensers are generally
