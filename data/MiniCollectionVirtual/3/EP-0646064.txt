<ABSTRACT>
A packaged article, especially a respiring foodstuff such as cheese which generates or releases gas during storage, and a permeable multilayer biaxially oriented film suitable for allowing escape of such gas while minimizing transfer of oxygen across the film which has a thin layer of a blend of EVOH and nylon (6/66). In a preferred embodiment the low cost film having a high permeability to CO2 and low O2 permeability is used to package cheese.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to packaged respiring
foodstuffs and improvements in the art of packaging foodstuffs
which produce gas, particularly CO2 respiring foodstuffs,
especially cheeses such as for example emmental, gouda and
edam.Many hundreds of different kinds of cheese are made
today. The cheese making art is very old with evidence of
cheese making as far back as 2300 B.C. Cheese is a cultured
milk product i.e. typically a starter culture of bacteria
which produce lactic acid as added to milk along with an
enzyme called "rennin". Rennin typically comes from rennet
from the stomach of a calf or lamb, but may be derived from
either animal or plant sources. The acid produced by the
bacteria alters the pH of the milk to an acidity which causes
a milk protein termed "casein" to coagulate thereby forming
curds. Rennin is an enzyme which facilitates curd formation.
Typically, both acid produced by bacteria and rennin are used
together to form cheese curds and whey. Curds aggregate
holding fat and whey in a network of protein. In cheese 
making this curd formation is usually followed by pouring off
the whey and concentration of the curds. To remove additional
whey, curds may be cut, pressed, cooked and/or salted to
produce what is termed "green" or unripened cheese. Here
"green" refers to the youth or lack of aging of the cheese at
this point in manufacture. The green cheese may then be aged
or ripened for anywhere from a few days to up to four years or
more depending upon the cheese variety. This ripening may
continue even after packaging, but is generally slowed by
holding cheese at lower refrigeration temperatures.The above description relates to generally known
processes for making natural cheeses. Also known are
"processed" cheeses which are ground natural cheeses which
typically mix unripened and ripened cheeses with other
ingredients such as added milk and stabilizers followed by
pasteurization and usually packaging while hot.In forming natural cheeses, specific molds or bacteria
may be added just prior to or during ripening to produce
particular varieties of cheese having different
characteristics such as flavors, aromas, textures and
appearance.For example, blue cheeses are made by inserting a blue
green mold, Penicillium roquefort into the interior of the
cheese. There are also surface ripened cheeses such as brie
and camembert which have an exterior surface coat of a white
mold Penicillium camembert. Cheeses such as brick and
limburger are ripened by bacteria which are coated on the
surface
