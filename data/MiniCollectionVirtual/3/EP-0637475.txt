<ABSTRACT>
A method of vacuum casting wherein when the molten 
metal previously introduced into a molten metal reservoir (22) is 

fed into a cavity (16), the lowest head of the molten metal in 
the molten metal reservoir is held to be higher than the 

level of a sprue (16a), so that the cycle time of casting may be 
shortened and the quality of cast products may be improved. 

To this end, the interior of the molten metal reservoir is 
held gas tight while the sprue (16a) is opened by a gate member of 

straight tubular shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and an apparatus
for vacuum casting in which upon reaching of a predetermined
pressure reduction degree of a cavity formed in a die, a
sprue is opened by a gate member, causing the molten metal
collected in a molten metal passage and a molten metal
reservoir to flow into the cavity for casting.FIG. 10 shows a related art apparatus which has
been proposed by the applicant (Japanese Patent Application
No. 4-309534). The Japanese application is not laid open on
the priority date of the present application.As shown in FIG. 10, in the related art vacuum casting
process, when a die 50 having been closed is set over a gas-tight
furnace 59, the pressure in the gas-tight furnace 59
is increased by a pressurizing means (not shown), so that
the molten metal stored in a molten metal storage tank 59r
is pushed up to the interior of a molten metal reservoir 52
through a molten metal passage 58. When a predetermined
level is reached by the molten metal, the pressure in the
gas-tight furnace 59 is held at a constant value. Further,
substantially simultaneously with the pressure increase in 
the gas-tight furnace 59, the pressure in a cavity 56 is
reduced by an evacuating pump (not shown). When a
predetermined pressure reduction degree is reached in the
cavity 56, a gate member 52 is raised to open a sprue 56a,
thus causing the molten metal having been collected in the
molten metal passage 58 and the molten metal reservoir 52 to
flow into the cavity 56.In the above vacuum casting process, however, the
interior of the molten metal reservoir 52 is open to
atmosphere. Therefore, the head in the molten metal
reservoir 52 is greatly reduced during the flow of the
molten metal into the cavity 56. This is caused by a
pressure loss due to movement of the molten metal while the
differential pressure between the pressure in the gas-tight
furnace 59 and the pressure in the molten metal reservoir 52
is constant. In order to prevent air in the molten metal
reservoir 52 from being withdrawn into the cavity 56, it is
necessary to set the head in the molten metal reservoir 52
to a somewhat high level. That is, it is necessary to
collect a great quantity of molten metal in the molten metal
reservoir 52. Doing so poses the problems of elongation of
the cycle time of the casting and great reduction of the
molten metal temperature before the casting. Further, the
molten metal reservoir 52 should have a large height, thus
posing a problem of size increase of the casting apparatus. A technique in which
