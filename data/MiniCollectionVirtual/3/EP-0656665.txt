<ABSTRACT>
A piezoelectric device includes a ceramic 
substrate (5) having at least one cavity (5b) defined by a thin-walled 

region (5a) of the substrate. The thin-walled region 
has an outer surface provided with at least one 

piezoelectric transducer (2,3) and also with a non-operative (4) 
portion situated adjacent to the piezoelectric 

transducer such that each piezoelectric transducer 
surrounds the non-operative portion, or two 

piezoelectric transducers are arranged on both sides of 
the non-operative portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric
device for converting an input mechanical
quantity into an output electrical quantity, and vice
versa.As generally known in the art, piezoelectric
devices are typically used to convert an input
mechanical stress into an output electric charge
(voltage) and also to convert an input electric voltage
into an output mechanical strain. In the latter case,
the output strain can be used to generate mechanical
force, displacement or vibration, and the device is
sometimes called as an electrostrictive device. For the
sake of convenience, the term "piezoelectric device" as
used herein is to be interpreted in its broadest sense
as encompassing an electrostrictive device as well.
Also, unless otherwise noted, the term "piezoelectric
material" may be used in its broadest sense as
encompassing an electrostrictive material as well.Conventionally, there have been progressive 
demands for actuator devices capable of adjusting
lengths and/or positions of an optical path on a submicron
order, or for sensors capable of detecting fine
mechanical displacement as an electric change. In order
to satisfy these demands, developments have been made to
realize improved actuators or sensors which utilize
displacement due to a reverse piezoelectric effect or
electrostrictive effect which is caused by an electric
field applied to a piezoelectric or electrostrictive
material, such as ferroelectric material, and vice
versa. In the case of actuators, for example,
developments are directed to achieve a compact and less-expensive
arrangement of the device which stably
operates at a low driving voltage and yet provides a
high-speed response characteristic and a satisfactory
operational reliability.Known piezoelectric devices of the types shown in EP-A-408 305 and 408 306 typically include a
ceramic substrate having a cavity which is defined by a
thin-walled region in the substrate. The thin-walled
region of the substrate is provided thereon with a
piezoelectric transducer. Such transducer is comprised
of laminated layers including a lower electrode layer, a
piezoelectric or electrostrictive layer and an upper
electrode layer which are formed one above the other.
With such an arrangement of known devices, when a
piezoelectric layer comprising a piezoelectric material 
as opposed to an electrostrictive material is formed
between the two electrode layers and the upper and lower
electrodes are applied with a voltage having a polarity
which is same as that for performing a polarization
treatment
