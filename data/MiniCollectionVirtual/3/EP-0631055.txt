<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for a centrifugal pump impeller to 
be used when pumping polluted liquids. 
A cover disc (5) on the impeller (3) opposite the inlet (4) is provided 
with balancing openings (12) for balancing the axial force. The 

flow (Fâ‚‚) through said openings is used for rinsing the leading edges 
(7) of the vanes (6) where pollutions tend to collect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a pump of a so-called rotodynamic type comprising
a rotary impeller in a pump housing. Pumps of this sort may
essentially be divided into two types: centrifugal pumps and axial
flow pumps. A centrifugal pump impeller with the features of the preamble
of claim 1 is known from SU-A-1 751 429, in particular Figs. 2.3 and 2.5.A centrifugal pump comprises an impeller with a hub and at least one
cover disc provided with a number of vanes, a so-called open impeller.
A so-called closed impeller is provided with two cover discs and
intermediate vanes. The liquid is sucked into the center of the
impeller in an axial direction and leaves the impeller at the circumference
in an essentially tangential direction.The axial flow pump differs from the centrifugal pump in that the
liquid leaves the pump in an axial direction. The linking of the
liquid is carried out by a number of guide vanes arranged down stream
of the pump housing. The guide vanes also normally serve as support
elements in the pump construction.When pumping sewage water and water in some types of industrial processes
containing fibrous material, it often happens that the pumping
is disturbed by rags fibres etc being stuck to the leading edges of
the impeller vanes and the guide vanes. The build-up of pollutions
may initially cause vibrations in the pumps and eventually worse
efficiency and complete clogging. It is sometimes possible to get rid
of the pollution by letting the impeller rotate backwards at certain
intervals, but this is of course not a satisfactory solution. Another
way to diminish the risk for clogging is to provide the pump with
cutting means which disintegrate the pollutions before they enter the
impeller. An example is shown in the Swedish Patent No 8205774-6. A
disadvantage with this solution is that the cutting means may be worn
out and after that the clogging problems may get even worse.Other solutions to reduce clogging problems are shown in JP-A-58
192 995 and SU-A-1 143 884. Here, openings are arranged in the impeller where
additional flows are created, which are intended to flush pollutants. However, said
openings do not obtain this as they are incorrectly positioned.According to the invention, the problem to reduce clogging problems are solved by
help of a system of openings in the impeller, which openings are arranged in a
special way as stated in the claims. The invention is more closely described with reference to the drawings.Fig 1 shows a partial cut through a centrifugal pump with an impeller

<CLAIMS>
A centrifugal pump impeller for pumps to be used for pumping polluted liquids
such as waste water, said impeller (3) comprising at least one cover disc (5)

attached to a driving shaft (13), one or several vanes (6) mounted on the disc and a
central, axially directed inlet (4), the disc opposite said inlet being provided with

balancing openings (12) for reduction of the axial force that occurs during operation,
characterized in, that the balancing openings (12) are positioned very close in front

of the leading edges (7) of the vanes (6), each opening (12) radially inwards of a
corresponding leading edge (7), for letting the flow through said openings rinse said

edges.
A centrifugal pump impeller according to claim 1, characterized in, that the cover
disc (5) is provided with notches (15) at the openings (12), which notches guide the

flow from said openings towards the leading edges (7) of the vanes.
A centrifugal pump impeller according to claim 1, characterized in, that the impeller (3) is
attached to the driving shaft (13) by help of a bolt, the head (14) of which is radially

extended to partly cover the notches (15) for additional guiding of the flow from the
openings (12) in a direction which approaches the main flow F1 through the impeller.
