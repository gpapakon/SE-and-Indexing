<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a stable emulsified personal 
care product by (i) forming an anhydrous silicone mixture 

which includes a silicone such as a silicone oil or a 
silicone gum, the mixture further including a first silicone 

oxyalkylene copolymer and a second silicone oxyalkylene 
copolymer; (ii) forming an aqueous based pre-emulsified 

personal care product; and (iii) adding the anhydrous 
silicone mixture directly to the pre-emulsified personal care 

product without further emulsification.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to personal care
products for application to the skin which contain certain
silicone conditioning agents in combination with certain
silicone surfactants. When blended together, the silicone
conditioning agents and the silicone surfactants can be added
directly to aqueous based pre-emulsified personal care
products without further emulsification.The use of silicones in personal care products for
the skin has been increasing dramatically since about 1976.
Because of their unique properties, silicones have become a
major ingredient in such products. This growth can be
attributed to several factors, among which are (i) their
ability in providing excellent emolliency and lubricity which
softens and moisturizes the skin; (ii) their provision of
water repellency; and (iii) their capability in allowing the
formation of thin films on the skin in order that no greasy
or sticky feeling is imparted to the skin from the personal
care product.However, one of the principal hindrances to the use
of silicones is their limited solubility in water and other
polar media. This has been viewed as a problem by some
formulators who require higher solubility. One solution has
been to produce an emulsion of water and silicone. This
solution, however, has certain disadvantages in that an
emulsifier with the proper solubility has to be found, the
oil and water phases of the emulsion have to be prepared in
separate containers and then the two phases must be combined
under high shear using Eppenbach mixers or colloid mills.
This emulsion procedure entails what has been viewed by some 
to be unnecessary added time and expense, which ideally could
be avoided.EP 0 373 661 A2 discloses a water-in-oil type emulsion
containing silicones.The present invention provides a more simplified
approach to the problem, wherein emulsification of the
silicone prior to its addition into the personal care product
is not required and yet stable personal care products are
obtained.The invention provides an anhydrous silicone
mixture containing certain silicone oxyalkylene copolymers,
certain skin conditioning agents including silicone oils
which are volatile and non-volatile, silicone gums or
mixtures of silicone oils and gums.What is unexpected about the present invention is
that the anhydrous silicone mixture can be added directly to
an aqueous based pre-emulsified personal care product without
further emulsification. The personal care product containing
the claimed anhydrous silicone mixture has been found to
possess good
