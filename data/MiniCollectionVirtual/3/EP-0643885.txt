The second communication protocol includes a plurality of variable length information packets for passing parametric data to or from the addressable processors at selectable speeds. Whereby the operating state of the addressable processors may be determined or altered by, respectively, communicating parametric data from or to the addressable processor at variable baud rates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally related to communication
devices and more particularly related to communication
devices having a plurality of subsections.The need for this invention arose from problems of high
speed communication between register-modeled radio devices.
Current register modeled radio communication devices
communicate to each other using communication protocols
including fixed length information packets. With advances in
component technologies, radio communication devices can
now use memory components in sizes not previously feasible
for portable or mobile radio applications. In particular,
Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memories
(EEPROM) and Flash memories, are now available in sizes
where the operating system of a communication device may be
stored. In devices where the radio is programmed using
register modeled protocols, a significant amount of time is
required using fixed length message protocols presently
available. The time requirement is due to significant
overhead that is needed with fixed length messaging as
presently available. These fixed length messaging protocols
are described in U.S. Patents 4,637,022 and 4,684,941. In order 
to substantially reduce the programming time of the radio, an
improved register modeled system and a method of communication
between the register modeled components, that would overcome the
deficiencies of the prior art, is desired.WO 90 06027 discloses a local area network with
dynamically selectable multiple operational capabilities. Multiple
different operational capabilities, such as data transfer rates or
communication protocols, are selectable for use on a single LAN
comprising a plurality of nodes. Enhanced nodes of the LAN have
the capability of utilizing either an enhanced capability or a
common capability in communicating with other nodes. Those basic
nodes which are not of the enhanced variety have the capability of
communicating utilizing the common capability. The enhanced
nodes dynamically select the operational capability for the most
efficient communication with other nodes.In a first aspect, the present invention provides a radio
system, as claimed in claim 1.In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method
operating a radio communication device, as claimed in claim 11.FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a register modeled
communication system in accordance with the present invention.FIG. 2 shows a very simplified block diagram of a
programming subsystem in accordance with the present invention.FIG. 3 shows a flowchart
