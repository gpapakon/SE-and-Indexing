<DESCRIPTION>
 LIQU1DCRYSTALPOLYMERSThis invention concerns novel liquid crystal polymer (LCP) materials and method for preparing same.LCP's are known and are used in the electro-optical device industry, for example, in optical storage devices, in non-linear optical devices and in pyroelectric devices, see for example, GB 2146787 A and Makromol Chem, 186 2639-2647, 1985.One known type of LCP consists of a polymeric backbone to which are attached laterally pendant side chains which have a chemical structure that is mesogenic, ie. that induces liquid crystalline character, these being known as side chain liquid crystal polymers. Work in this field has identified a large number of side chain structures which are suitable, see for example GB 2146787 A. For some ,. purposes it is desirable that the LCP shows a smectic C( (Sc) or chiral smectic C (Sc*) liquid crystal phase, and a particularly preferred side chain for acheiving this is one which contains a laterally fluorinated biphenyl or terphenyl system. 

 Liquid crystal polyacrylates are known. Polymer Communications, 2±, 364-365, 1988, having a polyacrylate backbone, eg. polyraethacrylate, with dependent side chains, ie. of general structure:)m-X 
Where (CH2)m-X is the side chain and R is hydrogen or alkyl in the case of polyalkylacrylates, being methyl in polymethacrylates.According to the present invention there is provided a novel LCP material based on fumarate and maleate di-esters having improved liquid crystal properties over known LCP's, having a general formula I;I-o2c ■CHCH CO.R1 and R- may or may not be the same but have the following general srtucture:
 q » 0 or 1; r =1 or 2; s » 1 or 2;X - 0, C02, 02C, CH2;Y = C2H4, 0, C02, 02C;Z = CN, halogen, R, CO-R, OR, O-CR, wherein R = chiral or achiral.The general method of preparation of LCP's of formula I is by polymerisation of a compound of general structure:.o2c -CH=CH- •CO*.Wherein R. and R2 have the general structure defined above.EXAMPLE 1
 β ( H2)|oCOa*^θ)-^}-C 

 Step 2Step 3Step 14-hydroxy-4'cyanobiphenyl was stirred at room temperature with 11-bromo-l-undecanoic acid and trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane for 24 hours. The product was purified by recrystallisation from IMS.Step 2The product from step 1 was stirred at room temperature with fumaric acid and sodium hydride in hexamethyl phosphoramide for 18 hours. The solution was acidified and separated in ether/water. The product was purified by recrystallisation from IMS.Step 3The monomer was then stirred at 50-80 °C in a little 1.2-dichloroethane
