<ABSTRACT>
A dyeing tube includes a plurality of coaxial rings (3) each of which is 
connected to the adjacent rings (3) through a plurality of pliable linking 

members consisting in a pair of opposing arcs (4, 4') having a wide 
bending radius, the chord of each arc being a length of the upper or lower 

surface of a ring (3), said pair of arcs (4, 4') being centrally united at a 
spacer (5) projecting above and below inside the two arcs (4, 4') for an 

overall height equal to the distance between two adjacent rings (3) in the 
compressed condition of the tube. The thickness of the arcs (4, 4') 

progressively increases in a symmetrical way from the tube central portion 
(A) towards the ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns tubes for winding yarns subjected to 
dyeing, and in particular a dyeing tube having uniform and controlled axial 
compressibility. It is known that yarns which are being subjected to dyeing processes 
are wound on tubes or bobbins, usually made of a plastic material, which 
are then inserted on proper tubular supports and axially compressed in 
order to increase the compactness of the wound yarn and to reduce the 
space occupied. Prior art dyeing tubes essentially consist of a plurality of coaxial rings 
having the same diameter which are mutually connected through pliable 
linking members so as to form a cylindrical structure. However, prior art 
tubes include linking members which have several drawbacks when they 
undergo an elastic deformation upon compression. Italian patent n.1.217.969 discloses a tube provided with pliable 
linking members inclined with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tube. 
This kind of pliable members involves an axial torsion of the tube caused 
by the rotation of the rings around said axis upon compression of the tube. 
Therefore, the tube may buckle in an asymmetric way, causing stretching 
and tangling of the yarn near the tube surface with a consequent difficulty 
in unwinding the yarn at the end of the dyeing operation. Other types of dyeing tubes are provided with members which get 
deformed without causing the torsion of the tube. However, they are 
essentially thin bridges subjected to a progressive yielding due to the 
chemical substances and the thermal cycles to which they are exposed; 
this treatment may eventually result in excessive plastic deformations or 
even breakage. Furthermore, prior art dyeing tubes are made with a uniform structure 
along their whole length. In this way, upon compression on the tubular 
support, end portions get deformed first. Therefore, the resulting 
deformation is not uniform along the tube, with rubbing and tangling which 
hinder the unwinding and make the dyeing non-homogeneous. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a dyeing 
tube which overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks.  This object is achieved by means of a tube having the characteristics 
cited in claim 1. A first advantage of the tube according to the present invention is to 
allow a uniform distribution of the compression on the whole length of the 
tube, thus reducing the risks of tangling. A second advantage of this tube is that it gets compressed without 
any torsion. A further advantage of the present tube
