<ABSTRACT>
Electronic system (1) for automatically adjusting the 
inclination of the headlights (23
r
, 23
l
) of a vehicle, in 
which an electronic control unit (10) commands two linear 

actuators (20
r
, 20
l
) which modify the inclination of the 
optical axis (25) of respective headlights (23
r
, 23
l
) 
according to the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle 

recorded by an accelerometer (30) or by a velocity sensor 
(13). The system (1) keeps the maximum distance (L) of 

the area illuminated by the vehicle (23
r
, 23
l
) 
substantially constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
system for automatically adjusting the inclination of the
headlights of a vehicle, in particular a motor vehicle.It is known that rapid variation in the speed
of the vehicle causes pitching of the vehicle itself with
consequent variation in the angle of incidence which the
light rays generated by the vehicle headlights form with
the horizontal plane.In particular, sudden deceleration of the
vehicle causes an increase in this angle of incidence
(and hence a reduction in the illuminated area) and
sudden acceleration of the vehicle causes a decrease in
the angle of incidence (and an increase in the
illuminated area with consequent dazzling of oncoming
vehicles).In order to compensate for this pitching
effect, electronic systems have been provided, which
measure the angle of momentary pitching of the vehicle
and they use the value of the angle thus recorded in
order to modify automatically the inclination of the
optical axis of the vehicle headlights and keep the range
of the illuminated area substantially constant. In
particular, these systems are designed to keep the
maximum distance of the illuminated area from the vehicle
constant.Recording of the pitching angle is performed in
the known systems by means of differential measurement of
the distance from the ground of the front and rear ends
of the vehicle. These measurements are generally
performed by means of ultrasound sensors, potentiometric
sensors or pneumatic sensors.The known systems involve considerable costs,
use a large number of components and installation thereof
is therefore long and complex and expensive.A known system uses a differentiated velocity signal to switch
between a fast mode and a slow mode of adjustment.The aim of the present invention is to provide
an electronic system for automatically adjusting the
inclination of the headlights of a vehicle, which
overcomes the drawbacks of the known systems.The above aim is achieved by the present 
invention in that it relates to an electronic system for
automatically adjusting the inclination of the headlights
of a vehicle, as claimed in claim 1.The invention will now be illustrated with
particular reference to the accompanying figures which
show a preferred non-limiting embodiment thereof, in
which:
Figure 1 is a simplified block diagram of an
electronic system for automatic adjustment of the
inclination of the headlights of a vehicle, in particular
a motor vehicle, provided in accordance with the present
invention; andFigure 2 is a schematic
