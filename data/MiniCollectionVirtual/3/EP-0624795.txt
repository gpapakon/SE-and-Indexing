<ABSTRACT>
A biocompatible column for use in high pressure 
liquid chromatography application includes a 

biocompatible, polymeric inner tube (30) which is located 
within a metallic outer tube (25). The polymeric inner 

tube (30) has end fittings (31, 32) and the inner 
polymeric tube and such end fittings and comprise a 

unitary piece. Alternatively, the outside ends of the 
inner tube may be threaded so that appropriate polymeric 

end fittings can be removably attached to each end of the 
column. A liquid chromatography system in which the 

column of the present invention is used is also shown and 
described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an improved column for use in liquid
chromatography applications, and relates more particularly to a column well-suited
for applications involving relatively high pressures and/or requiring biocompatibility.Liquid chromatography (LC) is a well-known technique for separating the
constituent elements in a given sample. In a conventional LC system, a liquid
solvent (referred to as the "mobile phase") is introduced from a reservoir and is
pumped through the LC system. The mobile phase exits the pump under pressure.
The mobile phase then travels via tubing to a sample injection valve. As the
name suggests, the sample injection valve allows an operator to inject a sample into
the LC system, where the sample will be carried along with the mobile phase.The next most significant element in the LC system is the column. A typical
column usually consists of a piece of steel tubing which has been packed with a
"packing" material. The "packing" consists of the particulate material "packed"
inside the column. It usually consists of silica- or polymer-based particles, which
are often chemically bonded with a chemical functionality. When the sample is
carried through the column (along with the mobile phase), the various components
(solutes) in the sample migrate through the packing within the column at different 
rates (i.e., there is differential migration of the solutes). In other words, the various
components in a sample will move through the column at different rates. Because
of the different rates of movement, the components gradually separate as they
move through the column. Differential migration is affected by factors such as the
composition of the mobile phase, the composition of the stationary phase (i.e., the
material with which the column is "packed"), and the temperature at which the
separation takes place. Thus, such factors will influence the separation of the
sample's various components. A more detailed description of the separation
process can be found, among other places, in Chapters 2 and 5 of Introductionto
Modern Liquid Chromatography (2d ed. 1979) by L. R. Snyder and J. J. Kirkland,
which chapters are incorporated by reference herein.Once the sample (with its components now separated) leaves the column,
it flows with the mobile phase past a detector. The detector detects the presence
of specific molecules or compounds. As discussed in Chapter 4 of Introduction to
Modern Liquid Chromatography, which chapter is incorporated by reference herein,
two general types of
