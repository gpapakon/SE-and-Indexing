<ABSTRACT>
Magnetic materials containing a rare earth metal, and iron or a similar metal, as well as nitrogen and carbon, are produced by gas absorbing nitrogen and carbon sequentially into a parent intermetallic compound; the resulting magnetic materials have high Tc, (my)oMs and (my)oHA, are essentially free of (alpha)-Fe, and have a coercivity at 300  K of at least 1.5 T. Anisotropic magnetic materials are produced by pretreating the intermetallic compound, which contains carbon, by powder sintering or oriented hot shaping, followed by nitriding and/or carbiding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ferromagnetic 
materials, more especially ferromagnetic materials 
which contain a rare earth element, iron, nitrogen and 
carbon, and optionally hydrogen. The invention relates to both isotropic and 
anisotropic magnetic materials. Ferromagnetic materials and permanent 
magnets are important materials widely used in 
electrical and electronic products. The well-established 
Nd2Fe14B based magnets have a high 
saturation magnetization, µoMs, of 1.6 T, high 
anisotropy field, µoHA, of 6.7 T and high energy 
product, (BH)max., of 360 kJ/m3 at room temperature. 
However, the low Curie temperature, Tc, of 310°C 
seriously reduces the performance above room 
temperature. EP 453,270 describes intermetallic magnetic 
materials produced by nitriding an intermetallic 
material in fine powder form. EP 470,475 describes nitriding a hot shaped 
Sm-Fe.  
 In recent years, many studies have been 
conducted on the nitrides and carbides of rare earth 
iron compounds, and two compounds, Sm2Fe17N2.3 and 
Sm2Fe17C2, have been formed with characteristics 
superior to Nd2Fe14B. For example, the parameters for 
Sm2Fe17N2.3 are Tc=485°C, µoMs=1.5 T, µoHA=15 T and 
for Sm2Fe17C2 are Tc=407°C, µoMs=1.4 T and µoHA=13.9 
T. These parameters imply that magnets made from 
these alloys could have an energy product as high as 
470 kJ/m3, with a superior Tc. However, the α-Fe 
precipitated during the nitriding is found to reduce 
the performance of hard magnets based solely on the 
nitrides. Furthermore, it is found that above 300°C, 
a significant quantity of nitrogen is released, 
reducing Tc.  
 In contrast, many carbides, despite their 
relatively smaller Tc and µoHA, contain little 
precipitated α-Fe and have no problems with 
outgassing. It is an object of this invention to provide 
novel intermetallic substances containing iron, a rare 
earth element, nitrogen and carbon. It is a particular object of this invention 
to provide such intermetallic substances in the form 
of magnetic materials, including isotropic magnetic 
materials and anisotropic magnetic materials. It is a further object of this invention to 
provide a process for producing the intermetallic 
substances. It is yet another object of this invention 
to provide shaped magnetic articles. In accordance with one aspect of the 
invention there is provided a magnetic material of 
formula (I): 
Rχ(Fe1-ηMη)yNαCβHγ 
wherein 
R is at least one element selected from Nd,
