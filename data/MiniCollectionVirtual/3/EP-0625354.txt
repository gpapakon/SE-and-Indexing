<CLAIMS>
The use of the natural or recombinant p40
subunit of mammalian IL-12, or parts or variants of the

p40 subunit of mammalian IL-12 which inhibit IL-12-mediated
activity, for producing a pharmaceutical for

treating pathological states which are accompanied by a
dysregulation of IL-12-mediated activities.
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the p40
subunit of IL-12 is of human origin.
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
pathological states are autoimmune diseases such as

systemic lupus erythematodes, Wegner's syndrome or
rheumatoid arthritis, bacterial or viral infections, or

certain solid tumors or leukemia.
The use of the natural or recombinant p40
subunit of mammalian IL-12, or parts or variants of the

p40 subunit of mammalian IL-12 which inhibit IL-12-mediated
activity, for producing a diagnostic agent for

detecting IL-12.
The use as claimed in claim 4, wherein the p40
subunit of IL-12 is of human origin.
A method of detecting the p40 subunit of
mammalian IL-12, wherein a sample which is to be

analyzed, and which contains the p40 subunit of
mammalian IL-12, is removed, a defined quantity of IL-12

is added and the inhibitory activity of p40 on IL-12
is measured. 
The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
sample to be analyzed is derived from a human body

fluid.
A diagnostic agent which comprises the natural
or recombinant p40 subunit of mammalian IL-12, or parts

or variants of the p40 subunit of mammalian IL-12 which
inhibit IL-12-mediated activity.
A diagnostic agent as claimed in claim 8, which
comprises the human p40 subunit of IL-12.
