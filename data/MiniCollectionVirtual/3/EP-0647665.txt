<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water-dispersible 
poly(urethane-urea) compositions that are useful as 
coatings. Although various preparations of drying oil 
based waterborne poly(urethane-urea) compositions are 
known, discovery of new preparations and alternative 
compositions is needed to extend the mechanical 
properties of the polyurethane compositions. The problems stated above have been solved 
with the discovery of novel poly(urethane-urea) 
compositions preparable by a process comprising: (A) 
forming a prepolymer comprising: (1) an alcoholized 
drying oil; (2) a diisocyanate; (3) a polyalkylene 
ether polyol; and (4) a dihydroxy containing alkanoic 
acid polyol; (B) neutralizing said prepolymer; (C) 
contacting said neutralized prepolymer with water and a 
diamine to form an amine chain extended poly(urethane-urea) 
dispersion wherein said chain-extended 
poly(urethane-urea) crosslinks at about room 
temperature upon drying. The inventive composition provides a one 
component, self-crosslinking composition that is stable 
and capable of drying and crosslinking at room  
 
temperature. When tested as a coating, the inventive 
composition was found to exhibit good flexibility and 
toughness in addition to at least one of the following 
characteristics: good chemical resistance, adhesion, 
abrasion, or high gloss. The inventive water based 
composition also offers a reduction of solvent 
emissions into the atmosphere as compared with 
traditional solvent based polyurethane coatings. 
Additionally, the one-component, self-crosslinkable 
water dispersion composition is a highly versatile 
composition that is easy to use in coating 
applications. As used herein, alcoholized drying oils 
include hydroxyl-containing reaction products of fatty 
acids or drying oils containing at least one carboxylic 
molecule and a hydroxyl donor (preferably an alcohol or 
polyol), as are well-known to those skilled in the art. 
Suitable alcoholized drying oils may be purchased as 
already alcoholized (thus having the hydroxyl group 
present, such as, for example, castor oil based diol) 
or may be prepared by known alcoholysis reactions where 
the fatty acid or drying oil is reacted with a hydroxyl 
donor (preferably an alcohol or polyol) to provide the 
oil or fatty acid with at least two hydroxyl groups. 
The alcoholized product, may be a mixture of 
monoglycerides, diglycerides, unreacted polyol (or 
alcohol), and unreacted oil (or fatty acid), as is 
typically obtained after an alcoholysis reaction. 
Alternatively, the
