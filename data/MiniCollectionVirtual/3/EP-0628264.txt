<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises two attached pieces (4), one on the sleeve (5) which slides along the mast and the other on the mast (6), at the top thereof, which are equipped with pulleys (10) around which a cord (11) is intended to be engaged in order to form a pulley block (12) and a device for wedging the cord (11). According to the invention, at least the lower piece (4) comprises a groove (15) for wedging the cord (11), having a vertical axis and located in the extension of one of the pulleys (10) of this peice (4), this groove (15) being arranged so that it permits the free sliding of the cord (11) when the latter is held in a substantially radial direction with respect to the mast (6) of the parasol (3), and so that it wedges the cord (11) when the free end (11b) thereof is brought into a substantially vertical position, that is to say in the extension of the strands of the pulley block (12) formed by the cord (11).
