serially connected diodes (D1-D4,SD1-D4,DF1,DF2), each having a 
first and a second electrodes, obtained in a lightly doped 

epitaxial layer (2;2,2') of a first conductivity type in which

of said plurality of diodes has the first electrode 
(12,13;31,32) connected to a gate layer (7) of the power device

comprising a heavily doped contact region (12;32) of the first 

conductivity type included in a lightly doped epitaxial layer 
region (13;31) of the first conductivity type which is isolated

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated structure
active clamp for the protection of power devices, particularly
high-voltage MOSFETs and IGBTs, against overvoltages, and to a
manufacturing process thereof.The term "active clamp" refers to a circuit which is
integrated on the same chip with a semiconductor power device
to protect it from overvoltages.The problems concerning the integration of active clamps in
power devices have been discussed in the European Patent
Application EP-A-0 624 806 falling under Art. 54(3) EPC.
In this document an integrated structure
protection circuit comprising a plurality of serially connected
junction diodes between the gate and the drain of the power
device is disclosed.Parasitic components associated with this structure could
generate its uncorrect functioning. For example, the first
diode of the chain, connected to the gate of the power device,
has a parasitic bipolar transistor associated with it; this
bipolar transistor has a collector-emitter breakdown voltage
(BVCES) equal to the drain-source breakdown voltage (BVDSS) of
the power device. However, when the protection circuit operates
the parasitic transistor is biased in the active region, the
base current being equal to the current flowing through the
protection circuit. This causes the collector-emitter voltage
across the parasitic transistor, and thus the clamping voltage
(Vclamp) of the protection circuit, to drop to a value (LVCEO) 
which is much lower than the BVCES, while the desired Vclamp
should be just a little bit lower than the BVDSS.Consequently, if the power device is a power MOSFET, it is
necessary to increase the thickness of the epitaxial layer,
i.e. its BVDSS, with the consequence of an undesired increase
in the "on" resistance value (RDS(on)).In the case of an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT),
due to the presence of a P+ substrate, the parasitic component
is no longer a bipolar transistor, but an SCR, which can
trigger a degenerative condition which could lead to the device
destruction.Different techniques for the integration of active clamps
are known.One of said technique provides for the integration of a
series of polysilicon diodes connected in parallel between the
gate and the drain of the power device.According to another technique
the active clamp features a polysilicon diode
in series to a junction diode.In US-A-5 162 966 there is disclosed an N-channel MOSFET with
gate shortcircuited to the drain and channel region connected
to the source of the power MOSFET in series to a
