<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
CMOS current steering circuits.It is well known to use current steering
circuits for supplying and selectively directing
current quantities to one or more outputs. Typically,
a current steering circuit has a first stage for
supplying a constant current, and a second stage --
usually comprising two transistors in parallel -- for
steering the constant current. In operation of such
current steering circuits, a predetermined bias is
applied to one of the transistors and the conductivity
of the other transistor is controlled so that current
is steered (i.e., routed) through the transistor that
exhibits the highest conductivity. In conventional
current steering circuits, regardless of where the
second stage routes the current, the current drawn by
the circuit is substantially constant.Current steering circuits, as implemented in
CMOS technology, are often designed for use in battery-operated
applications. For example, such circuits are
often used in battery-operated laptop computers.
Because such current steering circuits have the above-mentioned
characteristic of drawing the same quantity
of current whether or not the current is needed by the
applications hardware, the circuits unnecessarily
reduce the operative time of the batteries. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, vol. 20, N° 11A,
April 1978, page 4534, describes a current steering circuit
comprising at least one first powering device having an input, an
output and a control input; a first idling device having an
output; the first idling device output and the first powering
device output being electrically connected; means for introducing
a voltage to the first powering device input; means for
introducing a first controllable bias voltage to the first
powering control input to allow control of current output from
the first powering device; and the first idling device being
configured to output a substantially constant current. The present invention generally provides a
circuit for steering current to a selected output while
drawing only a minimal, idling current when no current
is required at the output. In other words, the circuit
of the present invention avoids drawing high current
when such current is not required by the applications
hardware, thus conserving the batteries that energize
the applications hardware.Broadly speaking, the circuit of the present
invention comprises two first stage transistors that
have their respective inputs and outputs in parallel,
one configured to constantly supply a minimal
