<ABSTRACT>
Cooled and purified air is introduced into a higher pressure rectification column 2 
and separated into oxygen-enriched liquid and nitrogen vapour. A stream of the 

oxygen-enriched liquid is flashed through a pressure reducing valve 20 to form a 
mixture of liquid further enriched in oxygen and vapour depleted of oxygen. The 

liquid is reboiled by reboiler 26. A stream of the further enriched liquid is 
reboiled in condenser 24 and is introduced into a lower pressure rectification 

column 4 for separation into oxygen and nitrogen products. Reflux for the 
columns 2 and 4 is formed by condensing in condenser 14 nitrogen vapour 

separated in the higher pressure rectification column 2. A reboiler 48 provides 
an upward flow of vapour through the column 4. The condenser 14 and reboiler 

48 take the form of a single heat exchanger. As shown in Figure 1, the reboiler 
26 is located in a phase separator 6; as shown in Figure 2, the reboiler is 

located in a rectification column 60 containing liquid-vapour contact devices 
above the level at which fluid issuing from the valve 20 is introduced. In either 

example, oxygen-depleted vapour is condensed in the condenser 24 by heat 
exchange with the further enriched liquid and at least some of the resulting 

condensate introduced into the lower pressure rectification column 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for separating air.Air is separated commercially by rectification. The most frequently used air
separation processes include the steps of compressing a stream of air, purifying
the resulting stream of compressed by removing water vapour and carbon
dioxide therefrom and cooling the stream of compressed air by heat exchange in
a main heat exchanger with returning product streams to a temperature suitable
for its rectification. The rectification is performed in a so-called "double
rectification column" comprising two rectification columns, one operating at
higher pressures than the other, a top region of the higher pressure rectification
column being in heat exchange relationship with a bottom region of the lower
pressure rectification column. Most or all of the cooled air is introduced into the
higher pressure rectification column and is separated therein into
oxygen-enriched liquid air and nitrogen vapour. The nitrogen vapour is
condensed in a condenser- reboiler. A part of the resulting condensate is used
as liquid reflux in the higher pressure rectification column. Oxygen-enriched
liquid air is withdrawn from the bottom of the higher pressure rectification
column, is sub-cooled, and is introduced into an intermediate region of the lower
pressure rectification column through a pressure-reducing valve. This
oxygen-enriched liquid air is separated into oxygen and nitrogen products in the
lower pressure rectification column. These products may be withdrawn in the
vapour state from the lower pressure rectification column and form the returning
streams against which the incoming air stream is heat exchanged.Liquid reflux for the lower pressure rectification column, is provided by taking
the rest of the liquid nitrogen condensate, sub-cooling it, and passing the
resulting sub-cooled liquid into the top of the lower pressure rectification column
through a pressure reducing valve.Conventionally, the lower pressure rectification column is operated at pressures
in the range of 1 to 1.5 bar. At such pressures it is desirable to use liquid
oxygen at the bottom of the lower pressure rectification column to meet the
condensation duty at the top of the higher pressure rectification column. Sufficient liquid oxygen is evaporated thereby to meet the requirements of the
lower pressure rectification column for reboil and to enable a good yield of
gaseous oxygen product to be achieved. It is known however that the yield of
oxygen can deteriorate if changes are made to the operating
