<ABSTRACT>
A coupling circuit for a multimeter adapted to 
perform multiple measurements includes a thermistor 

and constant current sources in series between an 
instrument input terminal and an instrument circuit 

adapted to source current for ohms measurements. 
Varistors shunt the constant current sources and 

are thermally coupled to the thermistor. An 
initial inrush of current is controlled by the 

constant current sources and when the voltage 
across a constant current source reaches the knee 

voltage of the paralleled varistor, the varistor 
shunts the constant current source and provides 

heat to the thermistor for insuring the latter will 
transition to its high resistance state. The 

thermistor then drops a substantial part of the 
input voltage, effectively disconnecting the low 

impedance ohms circuit from the input terminals and 
protecting the constant current source circuitry 

and varistors from extended application of high 
voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an input 
coupling circuit for a measuring instrument such as 
a multimeter, and particularly to such a circuit 
adapted to decouple an input terminal or terminals 
from a low impedance path when a voltage is to be 
measured. Measuring instruments are available which are 
multipurpose, e.g. that can provide voltage or 
resistance measurements at the same set of input 
terminals or probes without requiring manual 
switching from one mode of operation to another. 
Such an instrument typically includes a comparison 
circuit that will automatically change measurement 
functions from ohms to AC or DC volts if a voltage 
signal larger than a predetermined value is 
detected. This feature is intended to render the 
meter quicker and easier to use. For ohms measurements, the multimeter needs to 
source about 0.5 to 1 milliamperes of DC current 
from a 1 to 3 volt source. In order to accomplish 
this result, the resistance in the meter circuit 
has to be less than approximately 10,000 ohms. 
However, the same circuit must withstand the 
maximum rated input voltage of the multimeter, 
typically in the range of 600 to 1000 volts. A 
10,000 ohm resistor in series with the circuit 
would drop this voltage, but the power rating 
required would result in a physical resistor size 
prohibitively large for a hand-held instrument. 
Furthermore, voltage measuring instruments are 
conventionally high impedance devices in order to 
maintain measuring accuracy and avoid loading the  
 
circuit under test. A much higher impedance than a 
few thousand ohms is required to prevent excessive 
current from being drawn. The problem can be solved in part by inserting 
a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistor 
in series between the ohms measurement current 
sourcing circuit and the instrument input 
terminals. Then, when a voltage higher than a 
predetermined value is presented, sufficient 
current will flow through the thermistor body as 
will cause its resistance to change from a 
relatively low value to a value of several hundred 
thousand ohms whereby excessive current flow is 
inhibited. However, thermistors are not 
instantaneous in their operation and an initial 
surge or influx of current can result before the 
Curie temperature is reached, i.e., before the 
thermistor transitions to a high resistance state. 
This initial influx current can be objectionable 
from the standpoint of the circuit across which the 
voltage is being measured. It would be desirable, 
then, to be able to
