<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical machine which is excited by permanent magnets, especially an external-rotor motor or internal-rotor motor, having motor parts (10, 20) which can move with respect to one another and of which the first motor part (10) forms a multipole excitation field in an airgap (1) by means of permanent magnets (11) which are arranged on a yoke and form a magnetic return path with the soft-iron yoke and of which the second motor part (22) is a soft-iron yoke (21) having pole teeth (22) which project in the direction of the air gap (1) and around which coils (23) are wound, the yoke (12) of the first motor part (10), which is fitted with the permanent magnets, being formed from components having high magnetic permeability and low electrical conductivity, so that the magnetic flux in this yoke (12) is not reduced, but the formation of eddy currents is reduced as far as possible.
