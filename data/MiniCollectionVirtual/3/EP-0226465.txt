<ABSTRACT>
An improvement of an integral multilayer analytical 
element for quantitatively analyzing liquid samples such 

as body fluids which comprises a plurality of layers 
including at least one layer containing a color-forming 

reagent composition on a light-transmissive, water-­
impermeable support,

 
wherein an uppermost fibrous porous sheet, an upper 

non-fibrous porous sheet, a lower non-fibrous porous 
sheet and a water-absorbing layer containing a hydrophil­

ic polymer binder are provided in sequence on the sup­
port, and the three layers of said porous sheets are 

integrated by closely bonding them with an adhesive which 
is partially deposited on the interfaces between both 

sheets so as to form communicating openings whereby 
essentially not interfering with uniform passage of a 

liquid between adjoining two sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integral multilayer 
analytical element in the form of a flat plate or a 
sheet for use in the analysis (assay) of the desired analyte 
(substance to be analyzed) in an aqueous liquid sample, 
and more particularly to an integral multilayer analytical 
element in the form of a flat plate or a sheet 
for use in the analysis of an analyte such as bilirubin 
or protein in aqueous liquid samples, particularly body 
fluids such as whole blood in clinical test. As one type of dry analytical elements, there have 
been proposed a number of integral multilayer analytical 
elements (hereinafter referred to as multilayer analytical 
element) having such a structure that a reagent layer 
comprising a color-forming reagent dispersed in a hydrophilic 
polymer binder such as gelatin is provided on a 
transparent support and a porous spreading layer (hereinafter 
referred to as spreading layer) is provided as a 
uppermost layer, and they have been put to practical use. 
Such multilayer analytical elements are disclosed in more 
detail, for instance, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 
53(1978)-21677, U.S. Patent No. 3,992,158, U.S. Patent 
Reissue No. 30267, Japanese Patent Provisional Publication 
Nos. 55(1980)-90859, 55(1980)-164356, 57(1982)-66359, 
52(1977)-3488, 58(1983)-77661, 60(1985)-222769, 
57(1982)-148250 and 57(1982)-125847, etc. In these multilayer  
 
analytical elements, fine light-blocking particles 
such as fine titanium dioxide particles are incorporated 
into the spreading layer, or a light-blocking 
layer is interposed between the spreading layer and the 
reagent layer for the purpose of effectively analyzing 
analytes in whole blood samples. The multilayer analytical 
element allows the accurate analysis of an analyte or 
semiquantitative determination to be carried out by depositing 
only about 10 µℓ of an aqueous liquid sample such 
as whole blood or plasma on the spreading layer thereof 
and hence, the dry analytical method using the multilayer 
analytical element is an analytical method which has 
gained increasing use in the filed of clinical test. In the above-described integral multilayer analytical 
elements, a hydrophilic polymer binder such as gelatin 
is used in layers such as the reagent layer and the 
light-blocking layer other than the spreading layer and 
hence, these layers are water-permeable. However, there 
is generally a disadvantage that the permeation of analyte 
therethrough by diffusion is slow, high-molecular 
analyte, lipid are
