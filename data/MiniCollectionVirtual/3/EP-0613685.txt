<ABSTRACT>
Liposomes which contain encapsulated chlorhexidine diacetate or chlorhexidine digluconate and whose composition comprises, besides bilayer-forming lipids, additionally surfactants are described. Advantages which may be mentioned for liposomal administration compared with the free form of chlorhexidine are higher and longer activity and fewer side effects.

<CLAIMS>
Liposomes containing chlorhexidine diacetate or
chlorhexidine digluconate encapsulated therein,

comprising lipids which form a double layer and
surfactants, characterised in that the surfactants are

selected from among the bile acids and their
derivatives, and from the physiologically well-tolerated

salts thereof.
Liposomes according to claim 1, characterised in that
the lipids and/or surfactants are physiologically

well-tolerated compounds, preferably of natural
origin.
Liposomes according to one of claims 1 to 2,
characterised in that the lipids are selected from

among the phospholipids, sphingolipids and
glycolipids.
Liposomes according to at least one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the surfactants are selected

from the group comprising sodium cholate, sodium
deoxycholate, sodium glycocholate, sodium taurocholate

or sodium taurodeoxycholate.
Liposomes according to at least one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the molar ratio of lipids (L) to

surfactants (D) is from 0.5 to 40, preferably from 2
to 20 and particularly preferably from 3.1 to 5.5.
Liposomes according to at least one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that they contain in addition at

least one of the conventional auxiliary substances and
additives, preferably gel formers and membrane

stabilisers. 
Liposomes according to at least one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the lipids which form a double

layer and chlorhexidine, either as such or dissolved
in a small quantity of a water-miscible and suitably

physiologically well-tolerated solvent, are combined
with an aqueous solution of surfactants and the

formation of liposomes in the resulting heterogeneous
mixture is initiated by supplying mechanical energy,

in particular by shaking, stirring or filtration.
The use of liposomes according to one of claims 1 to 7
for the preparation of a medicament for the

prophylaxis and/or treatment of bacterial plaque
formation, for the chemical treatment of wounds of the

gingival pockets, for the treatment of periodically
occurring aphthous stomatitis, for the periapical

decontamination from bacteria of root canals during
endodontal therapy, for the treatment of Candida

mycoses of the oral mucosa and periglottis, for the
treatment of gingivitis and of gingival hyperplasia

and for the disinfection from bacteria of epidermal,
mesodermal and mucosal tissue.
