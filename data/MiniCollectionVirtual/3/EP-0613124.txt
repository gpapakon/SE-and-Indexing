<ABSTRACT>
A pick-up device for optical recording and playback 
includes two linear actuators coupled to an optical module and 

lying in a plane normal to the surface of an optical recording 
medium. The actuators are obliquely inclined to the optical 

axis of the optical module. Proportional differential actuation 
of the linear actuators moves the optical module bi-axially, 

i.e., normal or parallel to the recording medium surface, 
permitting control of both focus and tracking of information 

bits on the surface. The preferred embodiment employs two bi-directional 
linear actuators, each comprising a pair of back-to-back 

uni-directional actuators, each of which includes a 
flexible tubular housing enclosing a stack of thin, perforated 

disc-shaped electrodes separated by a dielectric fluid. 
Conductive elastomeric spacer rods support the disks in a 

parallel, longitudinally, spaced apart arrangement. Applying a 
voltage to adjacent pairs of disks via the conductive 

elastomeric rods causes an electrostatic attraction force 
between adjacent disks to shorten the stack. Contraction of the 

stack housing causes an elongated actuator rod disposed 
longitudinally through the housing and attached to a transverse 

end cap sealing the housing at one end to be extended further 
from the opposite end cap of th
e housing, the free end of the 
rod thus being able to exert a pushing force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of optical
recording and reproduction of information on optical disks and
similar optical information storage media. More particularly,
the invention relates to an improved shock-resistant pick-up
apparatus for directing radiant energy onto precisely
controllable locations of an optically sensitive recording
medium to record information on the medium, and/or to reproduce
information previously recorded on the medium.Optical storage of information on video disks has come
into widespread use for a variety of applications. Video disks
using pulse width modulated (PWM) and pulse code modulated (PCM)
signals containing audio, video, alphanumeric information, as
well as binary encoded data in general, are in common use.
Video disk systems use an electro-optical device, usually called
a pick-up, to focus on and track information-containing regions
of the disk, in which information bits are recorded by altering
an optical property of the disk. Individual bits of bi-directional
information may be recorded in spaces having a
maximum dimension of less than 1 micron. Typically, these
regions are arranged in the form of a continuous spiral track, 
or a series of concentric tracks, containing a string of bits.
Precise tracking is required to select a track, or to maintain a
selected track, or portion of a track, within the optical field
of view of the pick-up. Precise focusing is also required to
recover closely packed information bits contained in a track.Focusing and tracking of information bits are usually
performed by a servomechanism which moves the objective lens of
an optical pick-up apparatus. Normal motion of the pick-up with
respect to the information-bearing surface of the rotating disk
performs focusing, while radial motion of the pick-up performs
tracking. Motion required for focusing on the information
bearing surface of the video disk typically is achieved by
enclosing the lens in a relatively co-planar ring. The ring is
wound with an electrical coil, which in turn is mounted flexibly
within a concentric circular magnet. The coil and magnet
combination resembles the voice coil and magnet arrangement
found in common audio loudspeakers. Optical energy focused by
the lens onto a photodetector permits closed-loop servo control
of the relative distance between lens and disk.Tracking of information tracks on a rotating video
disk is typically accomplished by mounting one or more
electrical tracking coils onto the voice coil ring, radially
distant from but normal to
