<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an inking member made from a single, 
foraminous material. The foraminous material, such as polyurethane, is 

placed into a press. The top platen of the press is raised to a temperature of 
380 to 450° F and the material is subjected to a pressure of 8,618kg/force on 

a 165mm ram load for a period approximately of 3.5 minutes. What results is 
an inking member having small pores in the area adjacent to the heated 

platen and larger pores in those portions of the pad that are distant from the 
heated platen. This yields a foraminous, member that has utility as an inking 

member with the small pore portion acting as an ink metering layer and the 
large pore portion acting as an ink reservoir layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the printing operation of the impact type, a printhead is provided 
with ink, by an ink roller or ink pad, immediately before making contact with a 
medium such as paper. The inking member can be one of two types, one 
wherein ink is supplied continually to the inking member and the other where 
the inking member stores a quantity of ink and is replaced when that quantity 
of ink has been consumed. In a system where ink is continually supplied, a 
pump and ink reservoir must be provided that will keep up with the speed of 
printing. With regard to a self containing inking member, the advantages 
reside in not requiring a mechanism for supplying ink to the inking member, 
but the disadvantage is that the inking member must be replaced from time to 
time on a much more frequent basis. There is also a tendency for the print 
intensity to vary from dark to light as the ink in the roller or pad is slowly 
depleting. The instant invention is directed to an inking member that is 
capable of storing a relatively large quantity of ink, yet is able to meter the ink 
efficiently. Although the ink member has primary advantages as a self 
contained inking layer, it can, nevertheless, be used as an inking member 
that is continually supplied with ink. Layered inking members have been developed recently; wherein, one 
layer serves as a reservoir for the ink and generally has large pores and the 
second layer serves as a metering layer and has smaller pores and tortuosity. Prior art inking members had two layers of different pore sizes that 
were placed adjacent to one another and held in place by a fixture. 
Subsequently, an adhesive inking member was optimized to be used between 
the said two layers so as to connect the two layers and provide better contact 
therebetween without reducing the flow of ink. Although good results were 
achieved with providing two layers of different pore sizes with an adhesive 
therebetween, certain disadvantages did result therefrom. As time passed,  
 
the adhesive would lose its properties and the layers could tend to separate 
from one another. Also, the adhesive could cause the inking member to curl 
after a passage of time, due to differences in the swelling rates which is a 
well known polymeric material property. Also, if the adhesive layer is not 
chosen or the bonding not done perfectly each time the delicate pore 
structure will be altered affecting ink flow. Clearly, it would be advantageous 
to have an inking pad that has a metering portion and an ink storage portion 
that

<CLAIMS>
A composition of matter that serves as an inking member after ink is 
added thereto, comprising: 

   a one piece body composed of foraminous material, said 
foraminous material having a first portion with a pore density that allows air to 

flow at a rate of 10 to 60 ml/min. and second portion confluent with said first 
portion and having a pore size that allows air to flow at a rate greater than 

100 ml/min. 
The composition of matter of Claim 1 wherein the foraminous 
material is an open cell foam. 
The composition of matter of Claim 2 wherein said second portion 
allows air to flow at a rate of 100 to 190 ml/min. 
The composition of matter of Claim 2 wherein said foraminous 
material is polyurethane. 
The composition of matter of Claim 2 wherein said member is in the 
form of a pad. 
A printing pad comprising: 
   a one piece, homogeneous unitary pad composed of a 

foraminous material, said foraminous material having a first portion with a 
thickness of approximately .432mm to 1.4mm inches and a pore size of 10 to 

20µ, and a second portion having a pore size of 140 to 180µ. 
The printing pad of Claim 6 wherein said foraminous material is 
polyurethane. 
The printing pad of Claim 6 wherein said second portion has a 
thickness of approximately 5.1mm to 7.62mm. 
In a method making a dual density ink pad, the steps 
comprising: 

   placing a quantity of an open cell foam in a press between two 
platens, 

   heating one of the platens of the press to a temperature 
between 380 and 450°F, 

   placing a shim having a thickness smaller than the thickness of 
the quantity of foam between the platens, 

   positioning the quantity of foam within the shim with a portion of 
the foam extending between the shim and the heated platen before pressure 

is applied, and 
   applying pressure to the heated platen until the heated pad 

engages the shim. 
The method of Claim 9 further including the step of applying heat 
for a period in excess of 2.5 mins. after the heated platen engages the shim. 
The method of Claim 9 further including the step of placing a plate 
having a polytetrafluoroethylene surface between the heated platen and the 

quantity of open cell foam. 
The method of Claim 9 wherein said step of placing a quantity of 
open cell foam comprises placing a quantity of polyurethane between the two 

platens.
