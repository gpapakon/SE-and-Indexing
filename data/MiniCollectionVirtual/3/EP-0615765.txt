<ABSTRACT>
A catheter introducer set (2) is disclosed. The device 
comprises a cannula (10) for insertion into a blood vessel, a 

tube (6) in fluid communication with the cannula and a needle 
for assisting in the introduction of the cannula into the 

vessel. Between the cannula and the tube is an intermediate 
member (8) which allows the needle to he gripped so that it 

can be inserted into the blood vessel. The intermediate 
member preferably has a pair of wings (14, 14') to facilitate 

the gripping of the needle. The needle has an opening or 
openings in it to allow a user to observe blood flashback 

during insertion of the needle into the blood vessel. The 
intermediate member (8) is made of polyurethane and is 

provided with a groove (13) to facilitate the gripping of the 
needle. The wings have ramps (52, 52') on them to facilitate 

the gripping of the needle. Ribs (53) are also provided 
between the ramp and the intermediate member to facilitate 

gripping. The wings describe an angle of less than 180 
degrees.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of medical catheters. In 
particular it relates to a catheter for providing access to a blood vessel and the like 
and having features which facilitate its introduction into the vessel. Winged infusion sets are commonly used by the medical profession for the 
infusion of medication and the drawing of fluids from vessels. A species of such 
devices (a "scalp vein set") may comprise a needle with wings attached to it. 
Attached to the needle, and in fluid communication with the needle bore is a 
translucent tube through which medication can be infused or fluids drawn. Another 
species (a winged catheter introducer), comprises a flexible cannula attached to a 
winged member and a translucent tube. Inside the cannula is a needle with a wire 
attached to it. The needle aids in the insertion of the catheter into a vessel and is 
withdrawn by pulling the wire once the cannula has been successfully introduced 
into the vessel. Such devices are introduced into the vessel as follows: The wings are gripped 
between the practitioner's forefinger and thumb. The practitioner uses the needle to 
pierce the skin in the vicinity of the vessel to be accessed. When the vessel is 
penetrated, the pressure in the vessel will cause blood to flow up the needle bore 
and into the translucent tubing. The practitioner verifies the penetration of the 
vessel by looking for blood "flashback" in the tubing. Once the device is 
satisfactorily positioned in the vessel it may be left there for some time. In the case 
of a winged catheter introducer, the needle is withdrawn from the cannula.  
 A device of the second species is shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,177,809 and 
5,163,913, this latter document being the one after which the preamble of claim 1 
was patterned. Such devices are sold under 
the trademarks Intima™ and Angioset® by Becton Dickinson & Co. of Franklin 
Lakes, New Jersey. A somewhat similar introducer set is disclosed, 
e.g. in DE-A-1 929 050. The gripping of the needle to facilitate insertion of the cannula is 
accomplished by the use of wedges on the wings which impinge on the a plastic 
sheath surrounding the needle when the wings are brought towards each other. The 
needle is gripped by the inner surface of the sheath which is distorted by the 
wedges. This structure requires that the wings be brought towards each other in the 
right direction or the needle will not be gripped. Using devices of the prior art, 
practitioners and nurses tend to bring the wings towards

<CLAIMS>
A catheter introducer set (2) comprising:
 
   a tube (6) having a first internal lumen;
 
   a cannula (10) for introduction into a blood vessel, the cannula (10) 

having a second internal lumen;
 
   an intermediate member (8) disposed between the cannula (10) and 

the tube (6) such that the first and second lumens are in fluid communication, 
the intermediate member (8) comprising a pair of wings (14, 14') 

attached thereto, the wings (14, 14') respectively being on substantially 
opposite sides of the intermediate member (8), the wings (14, 14') defining 

an angle between the wings (14, 14') and extending outwards from the intermediate 

member (8);
 
   a needle (16) comprising a sharp tip, the needle (16) being disposed 

lengthwise in the first and second lumens and within the intermediate 
member (8);
 
   gripping means (12) actuable by the wings (14, 14') for squeezing the 

intermediate member (8) such that the intermediate member (8) grips the 
needle (16) ;
 
   the wings (14,14') are initially in a first position, the 

wings (14, 14') being movable into a second position by bringing the wings 
(14, 14') together; and
 
   the gripping means (12) are actuable by the wings (14, 14') when the 

wings (14, 14') are brought together in a first direction such that the angle 
between the wings (14, 14') decreases, but not actuable by the wings (14, 

14') when the wings (14, 14') are brought together in a direction opposite to 
the first direction, and wherein the wings (14, 14') do not actuate the 

gripping means (12) when the wings (14, 14') are in the first position;
 
   characterized in that 

the angle between the wings (14, 14') is less than 180 degrees 
when the wings (14, 14') are in the first position.  

 
The catheter introducer set of claim 1 wherein the angle between the 
wings (14, 14') is approximately 170 degrees when the wings (14, 14') are in 

the first position. 
The catheter introducer set of claim 1 wherein the gripping means 
(12) comprise generally wedge-shaped members (52, 52') on the wings (14, 

14'), such that when the wings (14, 14') are brought together in the first 
direction, the gripping means (12) squeeze the intermediate member (8), 

thereby gripping the needle (16).
