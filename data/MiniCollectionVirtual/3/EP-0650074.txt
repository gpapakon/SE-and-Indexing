<ABSTRACT>
A balanced receive antenna circuit configuration determines an accurate 
position of a transponder within the antenna field pattern of the reader antenna 

The balanced receive antenna configuration consists of two antennas physically 
rotated 90 degrees relative to one another, disposed concentrically on top of one 

another. Furthermore, each receive antenna consists of two coils located a 
predetermined distance apart. The optimum distance separating the coils is 

determined by trading off zero position detection with the transponder 
detection range. The transmitter antenna surrounds the receiver coilset. In 

operation, initially the transmitter antenna sends a power burst signal for a 
predetermined duration to charge up the transponder to the maximum charge 

possible. Then for a very brief duration, the transmitter antenna is damped to 
permit the receive antennas to better receive the transponder response telegram. 

Then simultaneously, one receive antenna receives the 'X' position component 
and the other receiver antenna receives the 'Y' positio
n component in the form of 
voltages. Depending upon which quadrant of the antenna pattern the 

transponder is disposed, the sign and value of the X component and the Y 
component of voltage is detected. These voltages are then narrow band filtered 

around a center frequency and gated for a small portion of the length of the 
entire response telegram, and those outputs are combined in a signal processor 

which outputs the exact position data information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to positioning with RF-ID systems. In a standard Radio Frequency-Identification (RF-ID) system, an 
interrogating antenna, sometimes called the transmitter antenna, transmits a 
power burst signal of some predetermined duration to power up the passive 
transponder in the field to respond. Once the transponder is fully charged from 
the interrogation signal, the power burst signal is damped at the interrogator, 
and the transponder transmits it response telegram. The response telegram 
generally consists of identification information and/or sensor or other data and is 
received by the interrogator. If a response telegram is received, then the 
interrogator knows that the transponder lies within the read range of the 
interrogation antenna. However, generally, with standard RF-ID interrogation 
equipment, it is not possible to determine the exact physical position of a 
transponder within the read range of the antenna due to the many variables 
involved. Some other the relevant variables are the distance between the reader 
and antenna, interrogation antenna size, interrogation field strength, 
orientation of the transponder with respect to the antenna and ambient noise 
levels. With enough transponders located across an area, the approximate 
location of a particular object associated with a particular transponder may be 
achieved, but this solution will also probably be cost-prohibitive.  A balanced receive antenna circuit configuration determines an accurate 
position of a transponder within the antenna field pattern of the reader antenna. 
The balanced receive antenna configuration consists of two antennas physically 
rotated 90 degrees relative to one another, disposed concentrically on top of one 
another. Furthermore, each receive antenna consists of two coils located a 
predetermined distance apart. The optimum distance separating the coils is 
determined by trading off zero position detection with the transponder 
detection range. The transmitter antenna surrounds the receiver coilset. In 
operation, initially the transmitter antenna sends a power burst signal for a 
predetermined duration to charge up the transponder to the maximum charge 
possible. Then for a very brief duration, the transmitter antenna is damped to 
permit the receive antennas to better receive the transponder response telegram. 
Then simultaneously, one receive antenna receives the 'X' position component 
and the other receiver antenna receives the 'Y' position component in the form of 
voltage
