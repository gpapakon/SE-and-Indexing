<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method by means of which, for example, self-propelled mobile units can create a more accurate environmental map while moving through an unknown environment. The method according to the invention is predicated on the stereo sensor apparatus operating with a plurality of sensors and, via an evaluation unit, evaluating propagation-time differences for signals received on individual sensors and combining these signals to form measured-value groups relating to an object in the environment. Using the method according to the invention, the measurement results are intelligently revised and those measured values which would indicate, for example, edges behind surfaces or surfaces behind surfaces are eliminated, and the associated objects which are described by these measured values are suppressed in the environmental model of the sensor apparatus. Furthermore, the method according to the invention intends to eliminate measured-value groups which have the same distance (range) values, any object which supplies a relatively strong signal to the sensors being kept in the environmental map. In other respects, the angular dependency of object detection is taken into account by the sensors.

Method for the interpretation of measurement data which arises at a stereo sensor
arrangement (S) based on a wave reflection,


a) in which on the basis of the measurement data an environment model, which
comprises at least edges (K) and surfaces (W) as objects in the environment, of

the sensor arrangement (S) is created, wherein the position of the objects is
determined at least by their angle and their distance from the sensor arrangement

(S),
b) and in which at least one edge (K) behind a surface (W) and/or a surface (W)
behind a surface (W) is or are suppressed, characterised in that there is

suppressed in the environment model such an object of which an amplitude below
a threshold value is measured at at least one sensor (U1 to U3) of the sensor

arrangement (S).
Method according to claim 1,

a) in which the data measured by several sensors of the sensor arrangement with
respect to one object are combined into a group,
b) in which at least two groups are checked with respect to identical distance values,
c) and in which the object of that group with an identical distance value in the
environment model is suppressed, the sum of amplitude values - the amplitude

sum - of which is smaller.
Method according to claim 2, in which measurement data from three sensors are
combined and in which the median value of the amplitude values is added to the amplitude

sum, so that an evaluation value results, wherein the object of that group with the smallest
evaluation value in the environment model is suppressed.
Method according to claim 3, in which there is used on the amplitude values
measured per object an evaluation function in which function the position of an object in

relation to a first sensor of the sensor arrangement is taken into consideration in such a
manner that an object which in the environment model lies near the first sensor, but from

which only an amplitude value below a threshold value is measured at the sensor, is given
a reduced evaluation value. 
Method according to claim 4, in which the evaluation value is halved for the case
that the angle relative to the object amounts to more than ten degrees.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, which is for use in a self-moving
mobile unit, wherein the sensor arrangement is mounted at the unit and an environment

model of the environment of this unit is dynamically created and the unit is automatically
manoeuvred in the environment with the assistance of the method.
