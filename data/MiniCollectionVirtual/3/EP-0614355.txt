<ABSTRACT>
Tumor-associated antigens which caracterize tumors of given histologic types are exemplified by CO-029, which is associated with tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, colorectum and pancreas, and by GA-733-2, which is associated with tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, prostate, cervix, ovary, bladder, lung, breast, colorectum and pancreas. These antigens, which are broadly shared by these tumors, can be synthetically prepared, independent of the tumor itself. These independently prepared antigens are useful as active ingredients in compositions which provide therapeutic protocols to subjects that harbor such tumors or are at risk from such tumors. The vaccine compositions of the invention have enhanced antigenicity by virtue of encapsulation of these antigens in liposomes or covalent coupling of the antigens with liposomes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of cancer
therapeutic protocols and the treatment and prevention of
cancer. More specifically, the invention concerns
antitumor vaccines comprising a GA733-2 antigen which is
encapsulated in, or coupled to, liposomes.cancer accounts for almost 500,000 deaths each
year in the United States, and more than 1,000,000 new
cases of cancer are diagnosed annually. As the average
lifespan increases, the incidence of cancer increases as
well. Despite the magnitude of the problem, treatment
strategies have been slow to evolve, and are most
typically invasive, painful, and associated with long-term
severe discomfort. Surgery, chemotherapy and
radiation have met with limited success while producing
severe side effects and dramatic lowering of quality of
life. There is clearly a need for more effective
treatment protocols.The use of tumor-associated antigens derived
from the subject's own tumor, formulated in a liposome
composition, and applied in treatment protocols has been
disclosed in Japanese patent application JP 2,188,532.
This application describes extraction and partial
purification of tumor-associated antigens and their
reconstitution into liposome compositions, as well as the 
use of these compositions in tumor treatment. The use of
extracted tumor-associated antigens as a vaccine when
associated with liposomes has also been described by
Phillips, N.C., et al., Cancer Det & Prev (1990) 14:491-496.
The use of liposomes as adjuvants for vaccines
generally is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,891,208 and
4,721,612, and in European application 036,277. Tumor-associated
antigens, also extracted from tumors, have
been encapsulated in liposomes for the purpose of ex vivo
testing, as described in U.S. Patent 4,343,895. Covalent
attachment of proteins to liposomes in general is
described by Heath, T.D., Meth Enzymol (1987) 149:111-119.Tumor-associated antigens which characterize
tumors of a particular histological type have also been
described. Sela, B.-A., et al., Hybridoma (1989) 8:481-491,
describe antibodies and precipitated antigens for
the gastrointestinal tumor antigen CO-029 and GA22-2.
Szala, S., et al., describe the cloning of a cDNA for a
carcinoma-associated antigen, GA733-2. In general,
antigens broadly associated with a tumor type
characterized by a particular histology have been
identified and purified. The GA733-2 antigen is useful in the
vaccines of the invention.US patent 4,557,931 discloses GM2 which is a
ganglioside present on the surface of tumors and which
stimu

<CLAIMS>
An antitumor vaccine composition comprising, as
active ingredient, a GA733-2 antigen, said antigen being

encapsulated in, or covalently bound to, a liposome
carrier.
The vaccine composition of claim 1 which
further contains an additional synthetically prepared

tumor-associated antigen.
An antitumor vaccine composition comprising, as
active ingredient, an anti-idiotypic antibody that

The use of claim 4 wherein the medicament
further contains an additional synthetically prepared

tumor associated antigen. 
The use of an anti-idiotypic antibody that

immunologically mimics the GA733-2 antigen encapsulated
in, or covalently bound to, a liposome carrier, in the

manufacture of a medicament for vaccinating against a
tumor that expresses the GA733-2 antigen.
