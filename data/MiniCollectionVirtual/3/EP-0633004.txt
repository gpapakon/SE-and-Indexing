<ABSTRACT>
An assembly of a safety lancet device (10) and a safety 
container (12) which includes a lancet assembly (14) and a safety 

container for receiving and locking with the lancet 
assembly after pricking the skin. The lancet assembly has 

an outer surface and includes a lancet having a lance tip (44), 
an outer sleeve (16), and a lip (64) disposed along the outer surface 

of the assembly after the lancet assembly has been used to 
prick the skin. The container includes a cup-shaped body (80) 

having an inner surface defining an internal cavity with a 
closed end (82) and an open end (84) for receiving the lancet 

assembly. The container further includes an interlock (100) 
disposed along the inner surface of the container, 

protruding into the internal cavity. When the used lancet 
assembly is inserted into the container after use, the 

interlock engages the lip to prevent the lancet assembly 
from being removed from the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to finger pricking 
devices such as pricking devices, and more specifically to 
the disposal of such devices after use. Various "finger-pricking" devices are commercially 
available to hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices, and the 
like, as well as to individual consumers. Such pricking 
devices include sharp-pointed lancets that are used to make 
a quick puncture or penetration of the patient's skin in 
order to provide a small outflow of blood. Various tests 
may be employed with only small amounts of blood so that 
blood flowing from a such a wound or puncture is normally 
sufficient for these tests. After use, extra care must be taken by the user to 
avoid being punctured by a used lancet. The risks in 
handling used lancets are greatly increased due to present 
day concerns regarding communicable diseases transmitted 
through body fluids such as blood. The lancet must be 
carefully handled until it can be properly disposed. 
Advances have been made in recent years to increase safety 
in handling such used devices. For example, pricking 
devices are currently available which include lancet tip 
automatic retraction features, or single shot firing 
mechanisms. Further advances are necessary, however, to 
protect those persons who handle used lancets, such as 
health care workers. One such lancet, for example, is shown in Danish 
Registered Design 
No. MR0933 (allowed on October 1, 1992). The Danish 
pricking device is a self-contained one which includes a 
unitary ejector and lancet assembly which is partially 
surrounded by a protective sheath or sleeve after use. The 
used lancet, however, still presents a danger of 
contamination in that it contains an aperture through which 
the lancet had protruded at one end of the sheath or sleeve  
 
where usually there remains a residue of the blood or body 
fluid produced by the prick. In this regard, certain regulations may exist which 
govern the ultimate disposal of such devices in hospitals, 
clinics, doctors' offices, and the like. Such devices must 
be disposed in dedicated, disposal containers, commonly 
referred to as "Sharp's containers." Sharp's containers 
provide additional protection for individuals ultimately 
handling the disposed lancets. However, such containers 
are not always readily available at the particular location 
where lancets are utilized. Consequently, they must be 
transported to the site of the Sharp's container, 
prolonging the period during which the carrier could come 
into contact with any

An assembly of a lancet assembly and a container 
comprising, in combination: 

   a lancet assembly for pricking skin, the lancet 
assembly having an outer surface and comprising 

   a lancet having a lance tip, 
   an outer sleeve, the lancet being 

substantially disposed within and passing through the outer 
sleeve to prick the skin, 

   a lip disposed along the outer surface after 
the lancet assembly has been used to prick the skin, 

   a safety container for receiving the lancet 
assembly after pricking the skin, the container having 

   a cup-shaped body having an inner surface 
defining an internal cavity with a closed end and an open 

end for receiving the lancet assembly, the body 
substantially surrounding the lancet assembly, 

   an interlock disposed along the inner 
surface protruding into the internal cavity, the interlock 

being disposed along the inner surface such that it engages 
the lip to prevent the lancet assembly from being removed 

from the container after the lancet assembly has been used 
to prick the skin has been inserted into the container. 
The assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
interlock includes stops which angle to a raised surface. 
The assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
lip is coupled to and moves with the lancet such that the 

lip assumes a first position prior to using the lancet 
assembly to prick the skin and a second position subsequent 

to using the lancet assembly to prick the skin. 
The assembly as claimed in claim 3 wherein the 
sleeve includes a channel, the lip being disposed such that 

it moves within the channel. 
The assembly as claimed in claim 4 wherein the 
interlock being disposed within the channel to engage the 

lip after the used lancet assembly is inserted into the 
container. 
The assembly as claimed in claim 4 wherein the 
interlock includes stops which angle to a raised surface, 

the interlock being disposed within the channel such that 
at least one of the stops engages the lip after the used 

lancet assembly is inserted into the container.
