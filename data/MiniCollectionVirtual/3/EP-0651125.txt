<ABSTRACT>
Connecting piece (10) for frame bars (11) which abut at an angle, in particular for door and window frames, which connecting piece is inserted into an end side of a cavity of a first frame bar (11) and is fastened on an outer wall of a second frame bar, between the ends thereof, and which connecting piece has a covering plate (19) which is oriented towards the, in particular, bevelled overhang of the second frame bar, partially covers the end surface of the first frame bar (11), and whose surface oriented towards the overhang of the second framebar is provided with an elastic sealing layer. In order to improve a connecting piece (10) with the features mentioned in the introduction, such that the connection of two frame bars (11) is of a satisfactory appearance in the connecting region and is also satisfactory from a technical standpoint, in particular as regards the sealing against moisture, it is designed such that the sealing layer is concealed by an outwardly projecting covering-plate edge, and that the covering plate (19) bears on the overhang.

Connection piece (10) for frame bars (11, 12) which abut against each other 
at an angle, in particular for door and window frames, which connection 

piece is inserted into an end side (13) of a hollow space (14) of a first frame 
bar (11) and is attached to an outer wall (15) of a second frame bar (12) 

between the ends thereof and which connection piece has a cover plate (19) 
which faces the especially chamfered overlap (17) of the second frame bar 

(12) and partially covers the end face (18) of the first frame bar (11), the 
surface (23), facing the overlap (17) of the second frame bar (12), of the 

said cover plate being provided with an elastic sealing layer (25), 
characterised in that the sealing layer (25) is concealed by a cover plate 

edge (19') which protrudes outwards and that the cover plate (19) lies 
directly on the overlap (17). 
Connection piece (10) for frame bars (11, 12) which abut against each other 
at an angle, in particular for door and window frames, which connection 

piece is inserted into an end side (13) of a hollow space (14) of a first frame 
bar (11) and is attached to an outer wall (15) of a second frame bar (12) 

between the ends thereof and which connection piece has a cover plate (19) 
which faces the especially chamfered overlap (17) of the second frame bar 

(12) and partially covers the end face (18) of the first frame bar (11), the 
surface (23), facing the overlap (17) of the second frame bar (12), of the 

said cover plate being provided with an elastic sealing layer (25), 
characterised in that the sealing layer (25) is concealed by an outer cover 

plate edge (19') which is formed by the lower side (19"') of the cover plate 
(19), wherein this lower side (19"') is planar over the entire width of the 

overlap (17), but is formed with an inwardly open angle and that the cover 
plate (19) lies directly on the overlap (17). 
Connection piece according to claim 2, characterised in that the cover plate  
 

edge (19') is formed by a beading of the cover plate (19), which beading lies 
over the full surface of the narrow surface (17') of the overlap (17) and 

extends over the entire length of said cover plate. 
Connection piece according to claim 3, characterised in that the cover plate 
(19) at its end edge (19") freely visible between the profiled bars (11, 12) is 

at least over a part of the edge height rounded in a concave or convex 
manner or is chamfered towards the overlap (17). 
Connection piece according to any one or several of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it maintains in its region comprising the stop-side upper 

edge (17") of the overlap (17) with its body surfaces (40) distance from the 
overlap (17) as far as into cover plate (19). 
Connection piece according to claim 5, characterised in that the sealing layer 
(25) extends from below the cover plate (19) around the stop-side upper 

edge (17") of the overlap (17) as far as the stop-side surface (17"') thereof, 
wherein the distance between the cover plate (19) and the overlap (17) is 

filled by the sealing layer (25), which does in fact allow in the region of a stop 
seal (41) of the overlap (17) free space for this stop seal (41). 
Connection piece according to any one or several of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the surface (22), facing the first frame bar (11), of the 

cover plate (19) is planar. 
Connection piece according to one or several of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the surface facing the first frame bar (11) is provided with an elastic 

sealing layer (24). 
Connection piece according to any one or several of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the cover plate (19) comprises at its outer periph
ery  
 

(20) a peripheral edge (21) which protrudes in parallel with the first frame 
bar (11) which it encompasses on the outside or inside, wherein the first 

frame bar (11), when encompassed on the inside by the peripheral edge 
(21), extends if necessary over the entire end edge of the cover plate (19). 
Connection piece according to any one or several of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the elastic sealing layer (24, 25) is fixedly connected to 

the cover plate (19). 
Connection piece according to any one or several of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the sealing layers (24, 25) provided above and below 

the cover plate (19) are formed in one piece by means of the holes (42) 
provided in the cover plate (19). 
Connection piece according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in 
that it consists of two partial pieces (27,26) which are connected to each 

other and are allocated in each case to one of the frame bars (11, 12), that 
the cover plate (19) is attached to the second partial piece (26) allocated to 

the second frame bar (12) and that the first partial piece (27) allocated to the 
first frame bar (11) lies on the bearing surface (28), of the cover plate (19), 

which is not covered by the first frame bar (11). 
Connection piece according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in 
that holding strips (30) for the frame sealing pieces (31) or frame sealing 

pieces (31) are attached to the lateral surfaces (29) of the second partial 
piece (26).
