<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithium 
niobate crystal wafer which can be utilized as a 
substrate of an optical wayeguide or elastic surface 
wave device, a process for the preparation of the same, 
and a method for the evaluation thereof. Particularly, 
it relates to a lithium niobate crystal wafer 
exhibiting remarkably reduced residual strain, a 
process for preparing the wafer at high productivity, 
and a method for evaluating the same. Up to this time, ferroelectric crystals such as 
lithium niobate and lithium tantalate crystals have 
been used for the production of elastic surface wave, 
Pockels, non-linear and pyroelectric elements and so 
on, by virtue of their excellent acoustic, electro-optical 
and pyroelectric effects. Generally, these 
crystals are grown by the Czocharalski method, annealed 
for the prevention of cracking in processing, poled for 
single polarization, and thereafter processed into a 
cylinder. This cylinder generally has a diameter of 50  
 
to 130 mm and a length of 30 to 100 mm. The 
cylindrical crystal boule thus prepared is cut into 
blocks having a specific crystal orientation, or sliced 
into wafers, followed by lapping and polishing. Then, 
the resulting products are provided as crystals for 
various devices. When lithium niobate crystal is used in the form 
of a wafer, the wafer generally has a diameter of 50 to 
125 mm and a thickness of 0.3 to 5 mm and is used in 
the production of optical waveguide, surface acoustic 
wave and pyroelectric elements and so on. However, residual strain is observed in some of 
the conventional ferroelectric crystal wafers and the 
residual strain in such wafers causes unevenness of 
characteristics of optical devices due to uncontrol of 
the release of the residual strain in the manufacturing 
process of the optical devices. In addition, the 
strain present in an elastic surface wave device brings 
interference against elastic surface waves and results 
in unstable temperature dependency. Consequently, the 
residual strain impedes providing a more stable device 
for practical use. In order to overcome these disadvantages, a 
lithium tantalate crystal wafer for an elastic surface 
wave device has been reported in Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 25420/1992, which is reduced in the 
variation in index of double refraction in the wafer.  
 
However, this patent document does not disclose any 
clear description on the preparation of such a crystal 
wafer and the object providing the crystal wafer free 
from the above disadvantages
