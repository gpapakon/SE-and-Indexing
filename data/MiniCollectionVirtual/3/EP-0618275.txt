<ABSTRACT>
The composition is a blend of an asphalt that contains 
sulfonate or sulfonic acid groups, a sulfonated polymer preferably of 

butyl rubbers, styrene-butadiene linear diblock polymer, styrene-butadiene-styrene 
linear or radial triblock polymer and EPDM, and a 

basic neutralizing agent. The amount of each component is effective to 
allow formation of one continuous phase or two interdispersed phases 

that do not segregate on standing at elevated temperatures associated 
with road paving.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to storage stable road paving 
asphaltic compositions having improved viscoelastic properties, 
softening points and, particularly, phase compatibility that are 
suitable for use as a binder in dense graded and open graded asphalt 
pavement and the process of making such asphaltic compositions. Asphalt has certain physical properties that vary widely 
with changes in temperature. For this reason, polymers often are 
added to asphalt to extend the range of its physical properties. 
Polymers can reduce the tendency of the asphalt to creep and rut in 
warm weather by enhancing its high temperature viscoelastic properties; 
and polymers can minimize cracking and stripping in cold weather 
by improving the asphalt's low temperature viscoelastic properties. Not all asphalts and polymers form compatible mixtures. 
Polymer modified asphalt's storage stability is greatly affected by 
the compatibility of the asphalt with the particular polymer. Incompatible 
and partially compatible mixtures undergo phase separation. Various methods have been suggested for making polymer-modified 
asphaltic compositions that are sufficiently compatible to be 
acceptably storage stable and that also have the viscosities and 
softening points in the ranges required for a particular application. 
Some, for example, rely on selecting appropriate polymer and/or other 
additives to affect the final properties of the asphalt-polymer 
mixture (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,600,635 for use of a  
 
bitumen-based adhesive composition comprising bitumen, oil and an 
ionomeric elastomer, such as sulfonated, carboxylated or phosphonated 
EPDM or butyl rubber, in amounts less than 15% by weight of the 
mixture that is neutralized by metal cations; British Patent No. 
1,534,183 for addition of from 5% to 95% wt. of an ethylene/vinyl 
ester copolymer and bitumen partially crosslinked by means of -O-M-O-, 
O-B-O- or -O-CRR'-O- bridges; or U.S. 4,882,373 for acid modification 
of asphalt with subsequent contact with an oxygen-containing gas, and 
mixing with a thermoplastic elastomer, and unsaturated functional 
monomer.) Others oxidize the asphalt before using it. U.S. Patent No. 
4,371,641 teaches that a polymer, preferably an unsaturated elastomer, 
e.g., EPDM or butyl rubber, or a thermoplastic polymer and an appropriate 
filler can be added to airblown asphalt to make it suitable for 
use as a roofing material by increasing the asphalt's stability 
towards oxidation and decreasing its sensitivity to
