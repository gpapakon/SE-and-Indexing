<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates-to a method of thermally treating
a moving mineral fibre web wherein oppositely directed
gas streams are introduced into the fibre web
from opposite sides thereof through inlet zones and
wherein the gas streams thus introduced are released
from the same side as they are introduced through outlet
zones.DK patent application No. 2558/78 discloses a curing
oven comprising means for passing a hot gas stream
through a mineral fibre web arranged between two gas
permeable conveyor belts in a direction perpendicular
to the web plane.It is known that the amount of heat which is transmitted
from the hot air to the thermocuring binder contained
in the mineral fibre web is proportional to the pressure
at which the hot air is introduced into the mineral
fibre web.Therefore, attempts have been made to increase
the curing capacity of curing ovens of the type mentioned
above by increasing the air pressure on the inlet
side of the web.In case of heat treatment of mineral fibre webs and
in particular mineral fibre webs with a low density, an
increase in the differential pressure may result in irregular
compressions of the mineral fibre web which compressions
are probably due to the fact that the mineral
fibres are displaced relative to each other in areas where
there is a comparatively low fibre density under the influence
of the high differential pressure and that the curing
of the binder is insufficient at this point,Such compressions may easily result in the formation
of an uncontrollable amount of cavities in the fibre
web imparting thereto an unacceptable appearance and
an uneven insulating capacity.DE patent publication No. A 22753 IVC/80b, published
on 06/12/56, describes a method of the above-mentioned
type. In this known method hot gas streams
introduced from opposite sides of the mineral fibre web
and through slot openings which extend perpendicularly
to the direction of movement of the mineral fibre web
are forced to move parallel to the web plane in the direction
of movement of the mineral fibre web or opposite
thereto before the gas is passed away from the fibre web
through slot openings which extend perpendicularly to
the direction of movement of the web.It is stated that the purpose of this forced movement
of hot gas parallel with the web plane is to maintain the
gas within the mineral fibre web for as long as possible
thereby allowing it to release as much heat as possible.The invention is based on the discovery that; as a
consequence of the exceptionally large surface area of
the
