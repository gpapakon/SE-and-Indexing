<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method for preventing unauthorized 
copying and use of information which is stored on a storage medium and for 

restricting the use of such information to designated devices. Copy 
protection is achieved by generating a signature from a given storage 

medium. The signature is derived from an arbitrarily selected list of 
nonuniformities, uniformities and their attributes. The selected list may 

contain nonuniformities at any granularity level. As such, this signature is 
unique to a given storage medium in the same way finger prints are unique 

to a human being. This signature is used to derive a key for encrypting the 
information on the storage medium. Any copying of the distribution 

information from one storage medium to another results in the mutation of 
the signature required to decrypt the information. Therefore, the present 

invention obviates the need for introducing artificial indica or requiring a 
special hardware subsystem for achieving a copy protection scheme. 
Restricting the usage of information on a distribution medium to a 
designated device is achieved by verifying the device ID (DID-D) of the 

device with the device ID (DID-S) stored in the distribution medium before 
the decryption and transfer of information are undertaken. Decryption of the 

information is accomplished by generating a key from both the signature of 
the distribution medium and the DID-S.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of data processing, and in
particular, to the prevention of unauthorized duplication of digital information
on one storage medium to another. Furthermore, the present invention
restricts the use of information on an original medium to one or more
designated devices without introducing any key which is independent of the
characteristics of the media.Prior art copy protection schemes rely principally on either software
based methods, hardware keys or a combination thereof. Software based
methods use encryption techniques to prevent conventional copying
programs from making unauthorized usable copies. Unless the appropriate
decryption key is found on a storage medium, the programs on the storage
medium cease to function. By storage medium, the present invention refers
to all types of non-volatile storage medium. Examples of such media include
floppy disks, hard disks, optical disks and other non-volatile semiconductor
storage devices. Lately, new generation of copying programs are sufficiently
sophisticated such that most software previously protected by copy
protection schemes are copied without the authorization of the information
provider.Hardware key methods employ an explicit key on the system
hardware to enable the programs in the system. One such method uses as
key the hardware serial number or identification number. A second method
requires the user to buy a special kind of hardware with every purchase of
software. Thus whenever a new software is required, the necessary 
hardware has to be plugged into the system hardware. As such, the number
of concurrent software that can be run on a particular system is limited by the
number of such special hardware that can be simultaneously connected to
the system hardware.An example of a combination of software based method and
hardware key is U.S. Patent No. 4,903,296 which claims copy protection of
software on magnetic medium with a special key having two marks made on
the surface of the medium. These marks are not producible by conventional
disk drives and are in the form of absence of material and in the form of
domains which cannot be formed by conventional magnetic disk write
heads. Additionally, an encrypted key which is critical for running the
application is built into a special purpose hardware subsystem. Finally the
hardware subsystem is required to decrypt the key.Another patent is U.S. Patent No. 4,866,769 which claims a method of
copy protection of personal computer software distributed in diskettes

<CLAIMS>
A method for preventing unauthorized use of
information stored on a storage medium, the storage medium

having nonuniformities and uniformities, the nonuniformities not being artificially introduced on the medium, the method comprising the
steps of:


a) generating (80) a signature from the
nonuniformities of the storage medium;
b) incorporating (100) the signature into an
encryption key and encrypting (120) the

information prior to distributing the storage
medium;
c) permitting access to the storage medium by an
output device in response to verification (170)

of the signature; and
d) generating (220) a decryption key with the
signature for decrypting the information and

permitting access to the information by the
device.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the device for
which access to the information is permitted has a device

identification (ID) and wherein:

   in step b), the device identification (ID) is also
incorporated (100) into the encryption key; in step c),

access to the storage medium by the device is in response
to verification (170, 200) of the signature and the device

identification (ID) of the device; and in step d), the
decryption key is generated (220) with the signature and

the device identification (ID). 
The method as defined in any preceding claim, wherein
the method is for preventing the unauthorised use of

digital information.
The method as defined in any preceding claim, wherein
the information is encrypted in part or in total.
The method as defined in any preceding claim, wherein
the signature is a function of a list which comprises the

nonuniformities, uniformities and their attributes.
The method as defined in claim 5 wherein the list is
a subset of all of the nonuniformities and their

attributes.
The method as defined in claim 6, wherein said subset
is arbitrarily selected.
The method as defined in claim 6, wherein said subset
is selected non arbitrarily.
The method as defined in any preceding claim for use
in a system for distributing information wherein said

information includes distributed information (DI) and
supporting information (SI).
