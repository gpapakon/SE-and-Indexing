<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mechanism for driving a means of 
transport comprising a frame by human force and/or with a mechanical 

driving source. A part to be rotated by human force (2) is coupled, by 
resiliently deformable means, to a driven part, which is to be rotated 

so 
as to drive the means of transport. Monitoring means are provided for 

determining the angular displacement between the two parts, with a 
view to 

influencing said mechanical driving source through control means. A 
permanent magnet (23,24) is connected to the part to be rotated by 

human force (2) as 
well as to the driven part which is rotated, and sensors are provided 

on 
the frame in such a manner, that with each revolution of the rotatable 

parts the sensors detect the passage of a respective magnet (23,24), 
so as to 

generate signals influencing the control means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mechanism for driving a means of 
transport comprising a frame by human force and/or with a mechanical 
driving source, whereby a part to be rotated by human force is 
coupled, by resiliently deformable means, to a driven part, which is 
to be rotated so as to drive the means of transport, whilst monitoring 
means are provided for determining the angular displacement between 
the two parts and the speed of said rotating parts, with a view to 
influencing said mechanical driving source through control means. Such a mechanims is described in US Patent No. 5,024,286, more 
in particular used in a bicycle equipped with an auxiliary motor. 
Although the present application also describes an embodiment wherein 
the mechanism is used in a motor-assisted bicycle, it will be apparent 
that the mechanism according the invention can also be used in other 
vehicles and/or craft, for example in a motor-assisted pedal boat. The bicycle known from US Patent No. 5,024,286 has two discs 
extending parallel to each other and being provided with openings at 
their circumference, said discs being used for determining the angle 
of displacement between the part rotated by human force and the part 
being driven. In the unloaded position of the parts the openings in 
the one discs are covered by parts of the other disc. During operation 
the discs will generally rotate more or less with respect to each 
other, as a result of which the apertured parts of the discs will 
overlap each other to a larger or smaller extent. An optical sensor is 
used for detecting the extent to which the apertured parts of the 
discs overlap as well as the passage of said overlapping openings, in 
order to generate signals for influencing the control means of the 
mechanical driving source, all this as explained in the above-mentioned 
US Patent No. 5,024,286, the contents of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. Although the device may be statisfactory per se, the fact that 
the use of an optical sensor requires power constitutes a drawback, 
whilst such a mechanism is furthermore highly sensitive to fouling of 
the optical sensor. Accordingly the object of the invention is to obtain a 
mechanism of the above kind, which has a simple, efficient construction 
and which can operate in a reliable manner.  
 According to the invention this can be achieved in that said 
two parts are provided with a plurality of magnets, which are arranged 
in regularly spaced-apart relationship, and that sensors are provided 
on the
