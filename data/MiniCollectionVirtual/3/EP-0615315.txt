<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector attached to panels composing a 
door or a body of an automobile for wiring electrical parts 

includes a body (20) having a front opening and holding, in 
it, terminals capable of fitting with counterpart terminals 

respectively. A pair of locking arms (33) each capable of 
flexing inwardly are held on the outer periphery of the body 

(20). Each locking arm (33) has a concave-convex 
engagement structure (34) engaged with an edge of a mounting 

hole (W) formed in a panel (P) when the connector is 
inserted into the mounting hole (W). A pair of deformation 

preventing portions (42) are formed on the inside of the 
locking arms (33) to be engaged with the locking arms (33), 

respectively. The deformation preventing portions (42) 
restrict deformation of the locking arms (33) when engaged 

with the locking arms (33), respectively. The locking arms 
(33) engage the respective deformation preventing portions 

(42) such that flection of each locking arm is restricted 
when something strikes against the locking arms (33). Each 

locking arm (33) is not forced to excessively flex, thereby 
being protected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a panel-mounted electrical
connector having elastic locking arms on its outer
periphery and more particularly to such a connector wherein
each locking arm flexes inwardly at an edge of a mounting
hole formed in a panel when the connector is inserted into
the mounting hole and each locking arm returns to its normal
shape to engage the edge of the hole when the connector has
been inserted into the hole to assume a normal position.The electrical connector mentioned above includes those
attached to panels composing a door or a body of an
automobile so that electric parts equipped in the door are
connected to the body side. FIG. 9 illustrates a
conventional panel-mounted electrical connector 1. The
connector 1 includes a front bottomed cylindrical hood 2. A
plurality of male terminals 3 are held on a inner wall of
the hood 2 so as to project toward its front open end. A
flange 4 is formed on the outer periphery near the front end
of the hood 2. When the connector 1 is inserted into a
mounting hole W of a panel P, the flange 4 collides against
panel P. A pair of slit-like notched portions are formed in
each of upper and lower walls to extend from the open end
toward the inner wall. Two locking arms 5 each formed into
the shape of a plate with a small width and having
elasticity are provided between the respective pairs of
notched portions. Each locking arm 5 has a protrusion 6
formed on the outer peripheral side of its distal end. Each 
protrusion 6 has an inclined front side and a rear vertical
end. A distance between the rear vertical wall surface and
the front end wall surface of the flange 4 is so set as to
be approximately equal to the thickness of the panel P.When the above-described connector 1 is inserted into
the mounting hole W of the panel P, the front end of each
protrusion 6 collides against the edge of the hole W such
that each locking arm 5 flexes inwardly. When the connector
1 is further inserted into the hole W such that the front
wall surface of the flange 4 collides against the panel P,
each protrusion 6 passes through the panel P, whereupon each
locking arm 5 returns to its normal shape. The panel P is
then held between the rear vertical wall surface of each
protrusion 6 and the front wall surface of the flange 4,
whereby the connector 1 is held on the panel P.Since the male connectors 3 project in the hood 2,
something invades the hood 2 to strike against the male
connectors 3 during transportation such that some or all the
male connectors 3 bend. To prevent

An electrical connector comprising:

a body (20) having a front opening and holding therein
a plurality of terminals capable of fitting with counterpart

terminals respectively and a pair of locking arms (33)
each capable of flexing inwardly and outwardly and held on

the outer periphery of the body (20), each locking arm (33)
having a concave-convex engagement structure (34) being engaged

with an edge of a mounting hole (W) when the connector
is inserted into the mounting hole (W),

   characterized by

a pair of deformation preventing portions (42), which
are formed on a protecting cap (40) attachable to the front

opening of the body (20) of the connector such that said
deformation preventing portions (42) are arranged on the

inside of the locking arms (33) to be engaged with the
locking arms (33), respectively, the deformation preventing

portions (42) restricting deformation of the locking arms
(33) when engaged with the locking arms (33), respectively.
The connector according to claim 1, characterized
in that a gap is defined between each deformation preventing

portion (42) and the inside of the corresponding locking
arm (33), each gap allowing the corresponding locking

arm (33) to flex when the concave-convex engagement structure
(34) of each locking arm (33) is engaged with the edge

of the mounting hole (W).
The connector according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that each deformation preventing portion (42)

formed on the protecting cap (40) projects toward the inside
of the open end of the connector body (20) and has an

engagement structure (43) engaging the connector body (20)
in the inside of the open end of the connector body (20). 
The connector according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized
in that each deformation preventing portion (42)

projecting toward the inside of the open end of the connector
body (20) has an elastic distal end and an engagement

structure (43) capable of engaging, at the distal end
thereof, the inner peripheral surface of the connector body

(20)
The connector according to anyone of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that each locking arm (33) has in an inside

surface thereof a guide groove (36) guiding the engagement
structure (43) of each deformation preventing portion

(42) to the inside of the open end of the connector
body (20).
