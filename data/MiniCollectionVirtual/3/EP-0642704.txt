A constant torque monophase electromagnetic 
actuator including a fixed member provided with a first 

statoric magnetic circuit made from a high magnetic 
permeability material which is excited by a least a field 

coil (10), and a movable member (1) provided with an axially 
magnetized disk (3) and having 2N pairs of magnetic poles 

with alternated magnetic orientation, the magnetization 
thereof being substantially uniform, said magnetized disk (3) 

being attached to a second magnetic circuit (6) made from a 
high magnetic permeability, with said movable member being 

provided with a coupling shaft (7), characterized in that 
linking between said fixed member (2), and said movable 

member (1) allows said coupling shaft (7) to be submitted to 
a least an axial play in the direction away from said fixed 

statoric member (2), and in that said magnetic disk (3) 
diameter is substantially equal to that of said statoric 

circuit poles, the play between said fixed member (2) and 
said movable member (1) being compensated due to fixed 

portion thereof being magnetically attracted to said movable 
member, and in that linking between said fixed member (2) and 

said movable member (1) further allows said coupling shaft to 
be radially displaced due to stray strains relating to 

manufacturing and coupling tolerances. 
The monophase electromagnetic actuator as 
recited in claim 1, characterized in that said movable member 

cooperates with said fixed member through a thrust ball 
bearing (11) which limits said movable member (1) 

displacement in the direction of said fixed member (2), said 
thrust ball bearing being substantially coplanar with a plane 

passing through statoric poles end portions, with said disk 
showing a central recess with a cross-section area at least 

equal to said thrust ball bearing cross-section area. 
The electromagntic actuator as recited in 
claim 2, characterized in that said coupling shaft (7) passes 

through said fixed member (2).  
 
The electromagnetic actuator as recited in 
any preceding claim, characterized in that said fixed member 

(2) includes a substantially cylindric bore wherein a nonmagnetic 

material linking part is arranged, said linking part 
cooperating with said thrust ball bearing and acting to 

magnetically isolate said thrust ball bearing from said fixed 
member (2). 
The electromagnetic actuator as recited in 
any preceding claim, characterized in that P/E ratio is 

higher than 4, with P being the pole width as measured along 
the median radius and E designating the distance between both 

statoric pieces.
