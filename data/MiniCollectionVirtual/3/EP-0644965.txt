<ABSTRACT>
A method of bleaching recycled paper containing pulp wherein said pulp is contacted with ozone in an ozone stage (Z) treatment comprising a brightness stabilizing step during or at the end of said ozone stage (Z), said stabilizing step consisting of contacting a small amount of hydrogen peroxide with said pulp, the amount of hydrogen peroxide contacted with said pulp being small compared to the amount of hydrogen peroxide usually in an hydrogen peroxide stage, no washing step of the pulp being provided between the ozone contacting step with said pulp and the hydrogen peroxide contacting step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with a method of
improving the efficiency of ozone in bleaching pulp
generated from waste paper.As society becomes increasingly environmentally
conscious, there has been a growing trend to recycle a
wide variety of consumable products including newspapers
and other wood pulp-based materials.Deinked waste fiber from chemical pulp products has
been usually bleached by chlorine-based compounds,
specifically chlorine and sodium hypochlorite. However,
the industry starts moving away from chlorine for
environmental concerns and this trend has been perceived
as well in the recycled paper industry. Sodium
hypochlorite is also perceived to be a chlorine compounds
producer in effluent streams and air emissions and, as a
result, is also an environmental concern. As such, there
is now a growing interest to use ozone and/or hydrogen
peroxide in the bleaching of recycled pulps.It is known, for example, from "Cellulose Chemistry
and Technology," 23-307-319 (1989) to bleach pulp with
ozone. However, ozone degradates cellulose which consequently
generates an important decrease of the polymerization 
degree of said cellulose which in turn
decreases mechanical strength of the pulp.In the article entitled "Upgrading of Waste Paper
with Hydrogen Peroxide," O. Helmling, Recycling Paper
from Fiber to Finished Products, pg. 714-724, is disclosed
the upgrading of pulp from waste paper with
hydrogen peroxide added during repulping; otherwise, the
pulp will yellow particularly under alkaline conditions.
Alkaline repulping is usually considered as being necessary
for dissolving the pulp fiber structure and for
dislodging ink particles from fibers by the swelling
process.However, it is necessary to stabilize hydrogen
peroxide when it is added to the pulp, because hydrogen
peroxide might be decomposed and/or consumed by organic
fine material found in waste paper and/or dilution water.
In early deinking processes carried out with hydrogen
peroxide, up to 5% sodium silicate was added to the pulp
as a stabilizer. However, because of scaling-up problems
and reduced efficiency of the retention aids for paper
manufacture, a number of chelating agents were developed
as substitutes for sodium silicate as a stabilizer for
hydrogen peroxide, as disclosed by Indresh Mathur in
"Chelant Optimization in Deinking Formulation," 1st
Research Forum on Recycling, October 1991, pgs. 1-7. In
any event, regardless of the stabilizer employed, it is
believed to be necessary by the man skilled in the art to 
use some stabilizer
