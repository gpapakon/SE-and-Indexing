<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a novel storage battery (accumulator), there are two current busbars, which collect the surge-arresting lugs of the electrodes and are usually arranged symmetrically with respect to one another near to the edges of the plate pack. That current busbar having the one polarity is located above the centre of the plate pack and that current busbar having the other polarity is located alongside the former. The central position is particularly favourable for the current discharge from an electrode or cell, for which reason this current busbar should be connected to that electrode polarity which is less capable in respect of its electrical conductivity (for example the positive PbO2 electrode in the case of the lead-acid battery).

<CLAIMS>
An electrical accumulator having at least one cell, in each 
case having a plate pack, having at least one positive and one 

negative electrode which have diverter lugs for diverting the 
electrical current, and each having a bus-bar for each electrode 

polarity which connects the diverter lugs of electrodes in each 
case of the same pole to a terminal or to connecting elements of 

a neighbouring cell, characterized in that the bus-bar having the 
diverter lugs of the one electrode polarity is arranged 

approximately in the centre of one side of the plate pack, and 
the bus-bar having the diverter lugs of the other electrode 

polarity is arranged asymmetrically next to it. 
An electrical accumulator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that an adequate spacing for insulation is 

provided between the two bus-bars. 
An electrical accumulator according to either of Claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that the central bus-bar is associated 

with the electrode polarity whereof the active material has the 
lower electrical conductivity. 
An electrical accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the central bus-bar is arranged at least 

with its edge over the centre of the upper side of the plate 
pack. 
An electrical accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the central bus-bar has a width between 

5% and 15%, preferably between 7% and 10%, of the electrode 
width. 
An electrical accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that it is a lead accumulator.  

 
An electrical accumulator according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the positive electrodes have a diverter 

structure in the form of a cast grid or an expanded-metal grid 
made from an antimony-free lead-calcium alloy. 
An electrical accumulator according to either of Claims 6 
or 7, characterized in that the current-diverting connecting 

parts connected to the bus-bar, such as cell terminals or those 
for connecting from one cell to the next, are arranged on the 

side away from the negative bus-bars in the case of positive 
polarity and on the other hand are arranged on the side facing 

the positive bus-bars in the case of negative polarity. 
An electrical accumulator according to one of Claims 6 to 
8, characterized in that the current-diverting connecting parts 

connected to the bus-bar such as cell terminals or those for 
connecting from one cell to the next are always facing the side 

with the negative bus-bar in the case of positive polarity and 
are always facing the side with the positive bus-bar in the case 

of negative polarity. 
An electrical accumulator according to one of Claims 6 to 
9, characterized in that the underside of the negative bus-bar 

is arranged at least 0.3 cm, preferably at least 0.5 cm, higher 
up than that of the positive bus-bar, and the negative diverter 

lugs are constructed to be correspondingly longer than the 
positive ones.
