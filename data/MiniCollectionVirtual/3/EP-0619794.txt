<ABSTRACT>
A bottle case has pegs (2) hollow on the underside projecting upwards from its base (1) arranged at the corners at which four square compartments (3) meet. At each side wall section (7) facing one of the adjacent compartments (3) the hollow pegs (2) have a bracket (10) secured to the hollow peg (2) at its upper and lower end which is separated from the adjacent regions of the side wall section (7) by slots (11) and projects slightly into the compartment (3). It is reinforced on the inside by two longitudinal ribs (15). It forms a clamping component which, by deforming slightly, develops a relatively high effective pressure between its approximately vertical lower section (13) and a bottle (16) inserted into the compartment (3) and thus reliably retains even empty pet bottles.

<CLAIMS>
Bottle crate having a plurality of dividing 
columns which jut up from the base (1), are 

spaced apart from one another and form a regular 
pattern, in that they are arranged in the corners 

of squares forming compartments (3) and are 
connected to one another by means of dividing 

walls (4), at least some of these dividing 
columns bearing elastic clamping elements which 

protrude into adjoining compartments (3), so that 
at least one clamping element protrudes into each 

compartment (3), characterized in that each 
clamping element is configured as a bow (10) 

which can be pressed in towards the dividing 
column and has an approximately vertically 

aligned lower section (13) and an adjoining upper 
section (14) which is bent over obliquely towards 

the dividing column, this bow (10) being 
connected at its upper end to the dividing column 

and at its lower end likewise to the dividing 
column or to the base (1) in such a way that when 

a bottle (16) is inserted, there is a slight 
deformation of the bow (10), owing to it being 

anchored on both sides, and a sufficiently large 
contact force, and thus a reliable fractional 

engagement, is produced between the surface of 
the approximately vertically aligned section (13) 

of this bow (10) and the surface of this inserted 
bottle (16), each bow (10) being reinforced in a 

dimensionally stable manner by means of at least 
one longitudinal rib (15) in the region of the 

approximately vertically aligned section (13), 
and tapering of the longitudinal ribs at the 

upper or lower end of the bow (10) being provided, 
the longitudinal rib (15) being arranged 

in each case on the inside of the bow (10). 
Bottle crate according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the dividing columns are configured as  

 
downwardly open hollow pins (2), with an 

essentially enclosed side wall out of which the 
bows (10), separated by lateral slots (11) from 

edge regions adjoining on each side, protrude 
slightly into a compartment (3). 
Bottle crate according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that each dividing column, for 

each compartment (3) bordering it, exhibits at 
least one bow (10), which projects into the 

compartment (3) in question. 
Bottle crate according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it exhibits side walls (6) 

on which half dividing columns (2') are disposed, 
and in that each half dividing column (2') 

exhibits, for each compartment (3) bordering it, 
at least one bow (10), which projects into the 

compartment (3) in question.
