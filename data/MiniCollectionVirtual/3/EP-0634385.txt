<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing dichloroacetaldehyde hydrate 
together with chloral from acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde. 

The process comprises a step of chlorinating acetaldehyde 
or para-aldehyde to obtain a chlorinated solution 

containing dichloroacetaldehyde as a major component, a 
step of distilling this chlorinated solution to obtain a 

distillate having a boiling point of 90-100°C and 
containing 50% or more of dichloroacetaldehyde, a step of 

adding water to this distillate, crystallizing 
dichloroacetaldehyde hydrate, and separating the 

crystals, and a step of chlorinating the remaining 
aldehyde components into chloral. The process enables 

dichloroacetaldehyde hydrate to be separated at a high 
purity and the raw materials to be utilized efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing dichloroacetaldehyde hydrate together with 
chloral from acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde. Dichloroacetaldehyde (hereinafter abbreviated as 
DCA) is a compound useful as a raw material for the 
synthesis of drugs and agricultural chemicals. Because 
this compound is extremely unstable, it has been supplied 
as an aqueous solution. In the past, hydrate of DCA was 
manufactured by the method of chlorinating 1,2-dichloroethylene 
using a method described, for example, in 
Deutsche Offenlegungsschrift 2306335. This method is no 
more practiced at the present time, because 1,2-dichloroethylene 
is available only with difficulty. Chloral, on the other hand, is manufactured by the 
chlorination of acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde. DCA is 
known to be produced in the course of this chlorination 
process. The process, however, cannot produce DCA alone; 
DCA is obtained together with monochloroacetaldehyde and 
chloral which have chlorination degrees different from 
that of DCA. Boiling points of these chlorinated  
 
acetaldehyde compounds are very close each other. No 
method has been known to efficiently separate DCA from 
the mixture. Because of this reason, the production of 
DCA by the chlorination of acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde 
has not been practiced. In view of this situation, the present inventors 
have undertaken extensive studies with an object of 
developing a process for producing DCA hydrate from raw 
materials which are available at low costs, and completed the 
present invention, by which DCA can be produced as a 
hydrate together with chloral from acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde. As a result, the present inventors have found that 
high purity DCA hydrate crystals can be obtained if a 
mixture of chlorinated acetaldehydes with different 
chlorination degrees, which is obtained by the 
chlorination of acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde 
(hereinafter these are collectively called raw material 
aldehydes), is crystallized under specific conditions, 
and that the remaining raw material aldehydes can be 
effectively utilized by converting them into chloral 
hydrate. These findings have led to the completion of 
the present invention. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is 
to provide a process for producing DCA hydrate together  
 
with chloral from acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a process for separating crystals of DCA hydrate 
from the chlorinated solution obtained by the 
chlorination
