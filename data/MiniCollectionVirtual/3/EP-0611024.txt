<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixture of surface active chemical compounds obtained by reaction of microbial biomasses with alkyl halides, epoxides or acid halides, where the reaction  is carried out in the presence of a catalytically active agent and of one or more organic solvents which are immiscible with water. These compounds can be used as essentially non-ionic surfactants with a small anionic content for example as foaming agents, cleaners, emulsifiers for a wide variety of organic substances in water and for water-in-oil emulsions and in the widest sense as wetting agents.
