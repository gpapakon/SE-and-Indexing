<ABSTRACT>
Display tube including a deflection unit which comprises a coil support 
(8), a field deflection coil (12), a line deflection coil (11) and a yoke ring (14). Plate-shaped 

metal field correction elements (15, 15', 15'') are arranged between the field 
deflection coil (12) and the coil support (8), which elements are rigidly secured to the 

inner surface of the yoke ring by means of a form-filling adhesive which extends 
between the parts of the field deflection coil. Vibrations of the field correction elements 

and sound generated by transfer of these vibrations to the coil support are thereby 
substantially prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display device including a display tube with a deflection unit mounted thereon, said deflection unit
comprises a coil support, an inner (line) deflection coil, an outer (field) deflection coil,
a yoke ring and at least one plate-shaped metal correction means arranged within the
outer (field) deflection coil.A display tube of this type may be used in monochrome, colour and
projection television, in data display apparatus and in other apparatus in which cathode
ray tubes are used.Upon energization, the deflection unit generates magnetic deflection fields
so as to deflect electron beams generated in the display tube for forming a picture on
the display screen of the display tube. To influence the distribution of the field
deflection field, it is common practice to arrange a correction means made of thin, soft-magnetic
sheet material within the field deflection coil, for example, for improving the
convergence.A display tube according to the preamble of claim 1
is disclosed in the European patent Application EP 0 408 139 A2.
In this Application a correction means is described with soft magnetic
elements, which are secured to one of the deflection coils or to the coil support.In some cases it appears that an unwanted sound which is irritating to a
user is caused during picture display.It is an object of the invention to provide a display tube in which the
occurrence of an unwanted sound during picture display is at least substantially
prevented.According to the invention, a display tube of the type described in the
opening paragraph is therefore characterized in that the correction means is rigidly
secured to the inner surface of the yoke ring by means of a form-filling adhesive.
In accordance with an embodiment,
the correction means is arranged between the coil support and the field deflection coil,
because this facilitates positioning of the correction means.The invention is based on the recognition that the occurrence of an
unwanted sound is largely caused by the fact that the fields generated upon energization 
of the deflection unit lead to an unwanted vibration of the correction means which is
secured to the coil support in the conventional constructions. These vibrations are
passed on to the mechanical support (coil support) which produces the sound (acoustic
radiator). By securing, according to the invention, the correction means to a deflection
unit component having a high rigidity and mass (the yoke ring) and being preferably
isolated mechanically from the coil support as
