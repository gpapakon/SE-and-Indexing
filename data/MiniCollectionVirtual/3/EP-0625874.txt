<ABSTRACT>
Shortbread having a refreshing cooling sensation upon eating contain confectioners' sugar and fats bearing long, saturated C16 to C22 fatty acid residues and a mixture of short C2 to C4 acid residues, a portion of which are propionic acid residues. One preferred embodiment contains fats bearing acetic and propionic acid residues and residues of fatty acids derived from fully hydrogenated oils containing at least about 75 % stearic acid such as hydrogenated soybean oil or hydrogenated canola. Another preferred embodiment contains fats bearing a mixture of acetic, propionic and butyric and the same complement of long acids. These fats are low in calories, low in myristic and palmitic acid and trans unsaturated acid residues, and low in cholesterol. The cooling sensation imparted to the shortbread of this invention is achieved without adding other cooling-imparting ingredients such as dextrose, mint oils, or polyols, and can mask the burning sensation of artificial sweeteners and other ingredients.

 DESCRIPTIONSHORTBREAD HAVING A PERCEPTIBLE COOLING SENSATIONRelated U.S. Application DataThis is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. ap¬ plication Ser. No. 804,140, filed December 6, 1991, hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference, which was a con¬ tinuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/624,056, filed December 7, 1990, now abandoned, which was a con¬ tinuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/410,161, filed on September 20, 1989, now abandoned.Technical FieldThis invention relates to shortbread cookie composi¬ tions and processes for their preparation.A refreshing cooling sensation on consumption is de¬ sired for the improvement and enhancement of the mouth feel and palatability of many bakery and confectionery products. Cooling sensations can enhance the pleasant "quick get away" characteristics perceived when a bite of food dissolves, melts, changes from a solid to a liquid or disappears quick¬ ly or rapidly in the mouth, without a waxy or oily after¬ taste. In addition, some food ingredients, for example, sugar substitutes such as xylitol in sugar-free food pro¬ ducts for weight control, tooth decay suppression, and dia- 

betic diets, can produce a burning after-taste that cooling imparting ingredients or other special formulations can hel mask (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,400 to Olinger and Krueger) .It would be desirable to impart perceptible cooling sensations to certain food products.Background ArtA cooling sensation is generally imparted to foodstuff by the addition of certain ingredients such as dextrose, polyols, or mint oils, e.g., peppermint, spearmint, or win- tergreen, to the products. For example, in amounts above about 5 percent, dextrose tends to impart a cooling sensa¬ tion to filler creams (U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,991 to Porcello, et al . , and 4,865,859 to Porcello and Manns). In fon¬ dants, dextrose affects crystal structure and growth (Leach, H. ., The Bakers Digest , June 1968: 36-38). Polyols, notably glycerol and propylene glycol, appear to assist in aligning fat crystals in the fat component of coating com¬ positions, creating an elevated apparent melting temperatur in food products incorporating the additive (U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,769 to Kincs) .Imparting a cooling sensation is but one goal in the formulation of certain food products. Other goals include calorie reduction and fat reduction or the minimization of certain fat components. Dietary fat is the most concen¬ trated source of energy of all the nutrients, supplying 9 kcal/gra , about

CLAIMS
1. A shortbread composition comprising
(a) a starch component;
(b) a sweetener comprising confectioners' sugar; and
(c) a fat component comprising triglycerides bearing long C16 to C22 saturated fatty acid residues and a mix¬ ture of C2 to C3 short acid residues, a portion of which are propionic acid residues, added to impart a cooling sensation upon consumption of the shortbread.
2. A composition according to claim 1 wherein the short acid residues are derived from acids selected from the group consisting of a mixture of acetic acid and propion¬ ic acid and a mixture of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid.
3. A shortbread composition containing sugar and a shor¬ tening component, characterized in that the sugar compo¬ nent comprises confectioner's sugar and at least a por¬ tion of the shortening component contains triglycerides bearing long, saturated fatty acid residues derived from fatty acids having between 16 to 22 carbons, and short acid residues derived from acids selected from the group consisting of mixtures of acetic and propionic acid, mixtures of acetic and butyric acid, mixtures of propi- onic and butyric acid, and mixtures of acetic, propionic and butyric acid.
4. A composition according to claims 1, 2, or 3 wherein the long fatty acids are derived from hydrogenated oils having at least 75% stearic acid residues.
5. A composition according to claim 4 wherein the long, saturated fatty acids are derived from hydrogenated soy¬ bean oil, hydrogenated canola, or a mixture of these. 


6. A composition according to claims 1, 2, 3, or 5 wherein a perceptible cooling sensation is imparted to the shortbread composition without adding dextrose, poly¬ ols or mint oils to the composition.
7. A method for imparting, upon consumption, a percepti¬ ble cooling sensation to shortbread containing sugar and a fat component, which comprises formulating the sugar component with confectioner's sugar and formulating the fat component with triglycerides bearing long, saturated fatty acid residues derived from fatty acids having be¬ tween 16 and 22 carbons, and short acid residues derived from acids selected from the group consisting of mixtures of acetic and propionic acid, mixtures of propionic and butyric acid, and mixtures of acetic, propionic, and butyric acid.
8. A method according to claim 7 wherein at least 70% of the long fatty acid residues are derived from stearic acid, and the short acid residues are derived from mix¬ tures of acetic and propionic acid or mixtures of acetic, propionic, and butyric acid.
9. A method according to claims 7 or 8 wherein the long fatty acid residues are derived from hydrogenated oils having at least about 75% stearic acid residues.
10. Shortbread cookies made according to the method of claim 9.
