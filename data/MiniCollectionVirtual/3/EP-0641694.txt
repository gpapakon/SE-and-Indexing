Optoelectronic sensor device for registering natural precipitation on the outer 
surface of a transparent screen (1) by means of a beam conducting unit (2) 

adhering to the inner surface (1b) of the screen (1) and installed in a housing (4) 
with essentially rectangular contours whereby the beam conducting unit (2) 

features at least one measuring path encompassing at least one measuring area 
which is representative for the amount of precipitation, the said measuring path 

corresponding on the one hand to a beam transmitter (5*,5**) and on the other 
hand to a beam receiver (6*,6**) both of which are located in the housing (4) 

which is secured to the beam conducting unit (2) by means of clip elements 
comprising catch arms (4a* - 4d*) which feature catch lugs and are located on 

opposite sides of the housing (4) and of jogs (2e*,2e**,2f*,2f**) positioned on 
opposite sides of the beam conducting unit (2) each of which cooperates with a 

respectively corresponding catch lug,
characterized by the fact that
 each of the catch arms (4a* - 
4d*) corresponds to a push-in type locking device (9a - 9d) which is held in the 

housing (4) in a guided fashion parallel to the screen (1), is adjustable by way of 
an actuating element (10ab,10bc), and prevents the corresponding catch lugs from 

escaping from the respective jog (2e*,2e** and 2f*,2f**) with which it 
cooperates.  

 
Optoelectronic sensor device in accordance with claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the catch arms (4a* - 4d*) and the locking devices (9a - 9d) are formed 

onto the base element (4*) of the housing (4) comprising a base element (4*) 
which is attached to the inner surface (1b) of the screen (1) and a corresponding 

top cover element (4**). 
Optoelectronic sensor device in accordance with one of the claims in 1 or 2, 
characterized by the fact that in the area of each of the two opposite narrow sides 

of the housing (4) there are two locking devices (9a - 9d), one end zone (9a'' - 
9d'') of which runs parallel to the sides of the beam conducting unit (2), and the 

other end zone (9a' - 9d') of which corresponds to the catch arms (4a* - 4d*). 
Optoelectronic sensor device in accordance with claim 3, characterized by the 
fact that the one end zone (9a'' - 9d'') of the locking devices (9a - 9d) formed onto 

the one narrow side of the housing (4) or to the other end respectively are 
connected to each other by way of a common actuating element (10ad - 10bc). 
Optoelectronic sensor device in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized by the fact that the actuating elements (10ab - 10bc) formed onto 

the opposite narrow sides of the housing (4) and connected to the end zones (9a'' 
- 9d'') of the locking devices (9a - 9d) projecting from the housing (4) through 

apertures (4a
1
,4d
2
