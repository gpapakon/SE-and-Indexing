<ABSTRACT>
When a ring with an exposed dental X-ray film 
mounted thereon is thrown into a first tank filled with 

a processing solution, the ring is scooped into a space 
(1127) of a ring-holding portion (112) of a rotating 

arm (11) through a first opening (1125). As the ring-holding 
portion (112) is moving in the tank, the ring 

is pushed by a tilted bottom portion (1128) while being 
held within the space (1127) by a release preventing 

wall (1124) and a door (1129) so that the ring is also 
moving together with the ring-holding portion (112). 

When the ring-holding portion (1128) has fully moved 
out of the tank, the door (1129) is opened and the ring 

is released from the space (1127) into an adjacent tank 
through a second opening (1126).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automated development
processor for an exposed dental X-ray film so that
the exposed dental X-ray film is developed.X-ray pictures are often used for the diagnosis
and treatment of teeth. Such an X-ray picture is obtained
by sealing a dental X-ray film in an X-ray-transmitting
but light-tight pack, taking an X-ray picture
of teeth with the packed film, taking the X-ray
film out of the pack in a dark room or the like and
then processing it for development.Development processors for developing X-ray films
include various types. For example, the automated development
processor proposed in Japanese Patent Publication
No. SHO 53-17058 or the like has a compact construction
so that it can be easily installed even in a
private dental clinic. According to this automated development
processor, an X-ray film taken out of a pack
is developed by mounting the X-ray film on a ring and
then causing the ring to successively move through a
plurality of tanks which are each filled with a processing 
solution.FIG. 1 is a plan view of the ring with the X-ray
film mounted thereon, while FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional
view, taken in the direction of arrows II-II of FIG. 1.
In each of the drawings, there are shown the ring at
letter R and a slot formed in an inner periphery of the
ring R. The X-ray film which is designated at letter F
is fitted in the slot G so that the X-ray film is
mounted. This fitting can be readily carried out by
making use of the flexibility of the X-ray film F.The ring R is thrown into a tank and by an arm
attached to a rotary shaft, is then conveyed in the
tank. When the ring R reaches a predetermined location
in the tank, the ring R is thrown into a next tank and
is conveyed likewise by another arm in the next tank.
By successively conveying the ring R through the tanks
arranged adjacent to one another, the X-ray film F is
processed for its development, for example, is developed
and fixed, whereby an X-ray picture of teeth is
obtained on the X-ray film eventually.The above-described conventional automated development
processor is constructed so that the ring R with
the X-ray film F mounted thereon is transferred from
one tank to a next-stage tank arranged in adjacent to
the former tank. To smoothly perform this transfer 
without trouble, an arm which is brought into contact
with the ring R to convey the ring is formed to present
an aslant surface on a side of the next-stage tank.
The X-ray film F is therefore conveyed in a tilted
position during its conveyance through the

An automated development processor for an exposed
dental X-ray film, said processor having a

plurality of tanks (21,22,23) filled with processing
solutions, respectively, and arranged in parallel with

one another so that development processing of the exposed
dental X-ray film (F) is conducted by successively

throwing into the tanks a ring (R) with the exposed
dental X-ray film (F) mounted thereon, comprising:


a rotary shaft (10) whose axis extends in the
same direction as the direction of the arrangement of

the individual tanks (21,22,23); and

fixed portion (112;311;412) secured on said rotary

shaft (10) and a ring-holding portion (112;312;412) arranged
on a free end of said fixed portion (111;311;

411), and said ring-holding portion (112;312;412)
defines a space (1127;3127;4127) for holding said ring

(R) therein and comprises a bottom wall (1128;3128;
4129) for supporting said ring (R) in said space (1127;
