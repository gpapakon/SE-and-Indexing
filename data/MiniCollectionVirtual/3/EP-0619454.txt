<ABSTRACT>
The grid (1) for a luminaire (31) comprises an inner (2) and an outer 
circumferential reflector (12) extending concavely resp. convexly curved along an axis 

(3). The outer reflector (12) has a rim (15) bent back on itself, on which the inner 
reflector (2) rests with a shoulder (5) thereof. Lamellae (20) are secured to the outer 

reflector (12) and extend through an opening (16) in the outer reflector (12) radially 
away from the axis (3). The lamellae couple the reflectors (2, 12) one to another. The 

luminaire (31) provided with the grid (1) prevents glare beyond a small angle with the 
axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a louvre for use in the light emission window of a 
luminaire, comprising: 
an inner circumferential reflector having an axis and an inner surface 
concavely curved along this axis; an outer circumferential reflector having an outer surface concavely 
curved along the axis, which outer reflector is coupled to the inner reflector; lamellae fastened to the outer reflector and extending away from the axis. 
The invention also relates to a luminaire provided with this louvre. A luminaire provided with such a louvre is known from 
DE 38 26 676 A1. The known luminaire is designed for compact fluorescent lamps. The 
function of the louvre is to prevent the luminaire, mounted against or in a ceiling, from 
radiating light at great angles to the perpendicular and thus causing, for example, 
reflections on display screens and on work surfaces in the illuminated room. The inner reflector of the known louvre is parabolically curved and has an 
outwardly projecting collar at both its ends. The outer reflector is also parabolically 
curved and rests on one of these collars, while gripping behind the other collar with 
plate springs fastened to this reflector. The lamellae are parabolically curved, V-shaped, 
in cross-section. They are fastened to the outer reflector with screws. The construction of the known louvre has a number of disadvantages. A 
large number of components is required for assembling the louvre. This is one of the 
reasons why the assembly requires comparatively much time and the manufacture of the 
louvre is logistically complicated. The outwardly projecting collar on which the outer 
reflector rests intercepts light, which is thrown back sideways and thus is removed from 
the beam to be formed. The other outwardly projecting collar, behind which the plate 
springs grip, causes reflections in the luminaire, whereby locally undesirable increased  
 
brightnesses arise on portions of the luminaire, which detract from the homogeneity of 
the beam to be formed and from the comfort offered by the illumination. It is an object of the invention to provide a louvre of the kind described in 
the opening paragraph, as well as a luminaire provided therewith, which is of a simple 
construction which can be easily realised. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that 
the outer reflector has a rim bent back upon itself on which the inner 
reflector rests with a shoulder thereof, and the two reflectors are kept in position relative to one another by the 
lamellae. It is
