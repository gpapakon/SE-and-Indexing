<ABSTRACT>
A thread support means (27) traverses the rear side 
of needles (19, 21) in cooperation with a sewing machine 

main shaft and supports thread loops (11b, 13b) 
consecutive toward the needles from rows of a seam. When 

the needles penetrate through a thin fabric, the thread 
support means (27) prevents the thin fabric from being 

pushed down by the thread loops and sinking into the 
needle holes of a needle plate (29) together with the 

needles and causing distortion thereby. When the needles 
(19, 21) rise, the thread support means (27) slips out of 

the thread loops (11b, 13b), while the fabric advances by 
the length of one stitch, and the thread loops (11b, 13b) 

are absorbed into a newly formed stitch to be tightened 
appropriately, thereby forming a uniform seam without 

wrinkle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for sewing a fabric without causing distortion 
in a fabric due to pulling of a thread for forming a 
seam. When forming a seam on a fabric with a lock stitch 
sewing machine, a double chain stitch sewing machine, or 
the like, if the fabric is thin and soft, the seam is 
pulled to contract by the tension of the sewing thread, 
or the fabric sinks into the needle hole of the needle 
plate of the sewing machine when the needle penetrates 
into the fabric, and a seam-puckering is likely to occur 
along the seam. In the lock stitch sewing machine, in order to 
prevent such seam-puckering, it is attempted, for 
example, to sew with a shape retaining paper fitted to a 
thin fabric. On the other hand, with an interlock stitch sewing 
machine or a double chain stitch sewing machine for 
forming a double chain stitch with two or three needles  
 
and a looper, when forming a double chain stitch without 
upper cover thread on a fabric with two needles and three 
threads, or three needles and four threads (U.S. Federal 
stitch type 406 or 407), plural rows of seam appear on 
the top of the fabric, and plural rows of seam and an 
interposed cover thread (looper thread) appear on the 
lower surface of the fabric. When forming such seams on 
a thin fabric, the plural rows of seam are pulled to each 
other by the cover thread, or when the needles penetrate 
through the fabric, the fabric sinks into the needle 
holes of the needle plate together with the needles, 
thereby often the top surface of the fabric between the 
rows bulges up like a ridge. Similar problems occur when 
forming a lock stitch with two needles and three threads 
or three needles and four threads (e.g. U.S. Federal 
stitch type 309 or 311). The technique to solve such problems requires great 
skill such as adjusting thread tensions delicately, and 
sewing carefully with reduced work speed of the sewing 
machine. Moreover, in the interlock stitch or double chain 
stitch sewing machine of two or three needles, without 
using top cover thread, in order to raise the sewing 
efficiency, that is, to feed the fabrics one after 
another by continuously operating the sewing machine, it  
 
is necessary to form a thread chain continuously and 
smoothly between fabrics. In this kind of sewing 
machine, hitherto, after sewing one fabric and sending it 
out, the thread chain formed consecutive to the sewing 
end is pushed down by the needles descending for forming 
the next seam and droops beneath the

A sewing method for sewing a fabric with a 
sewing machine comprising a vertically moving needle (19, 

21), a thread loop taker (35) disposed beneath a needle 
plate (29) for forming a seam in cooperation with the 

needle, and a fabric feed device (31), said sewing method 
comprising steps of supporting a needle thread (11b, 13b) 

consecutive from the seam to the needle (19, 21) by a 
thread support means (27) traversing on a fabric delivery 

side of the needle when the needle descends in order to 
form a next seam, and putting aside the thread support 

means (27) when the needle rises. 
A sewing method of claim 1, wherein said sewing 
machine comprises a plurality of vertically moving 

needles and a single thread loop taker disposed beneath 
said needle plate for forming a seam in cooperation with 

said needles. 
A sewing method of claim 1, wherein said sewing 
machine comprises a plurality of vertically moving 

needles and a single looper traveling in a direction of 
arrangement of said needles beneath said needle plate to 

form a seam in cooperation with said needles. 
A sewing method of claim 3, wherein the needles 
are composed of a right needle and a left needle, and 

when forming a thread chain, a thread tension of the 
 

right needle thread is set low and a thread tension of 
the looper thread is high. 
In a sewing machine comprising one or more 
vertically moving needles (19, 21), a thread loop taker 

(35) disposed beneath a needle plate (29) for forming a 
seam in cooperation with the needles (19, 21), and a 

fabric feed device (31), said sewing machine further 
comprising a thread support means (27) which traverses a 

rear side of said needles (19, 21) when said needles (19, 
21) descend, and moves in synchronism with a vertical 

movement of said needles (19, 21) so as to set aside when 
said needles (19, 21) rise. 
In a sewing machine comprising a plurality of 
vertically moving needles (19, 21), a single looper (35)
