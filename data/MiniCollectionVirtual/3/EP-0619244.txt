<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package, and more particularly 
to a package for a sterilised food product. At the present time, packages for sterilised food products, 
e.g.for ready-to-prepare meals stored at ambient temperature, 
consist of a PP/EVOH/PP laminated tray having a PET/AL/PP 
laminated lidding foil packed in an outer cardboard box or a 
sleeve. Such packages are environmentally unsatisfactory 
because the many different laminates consist of materials 
that are bonded together and are difficult or impossible to 
recycle. For example, the alufoil from the lid remaining on 
the sealing surface of the tray after opening increases the 
difficulty of recycling as well as causing problems with 
microwave heating in the preparation for consumption. Such 
packages are also relatively expensive. We have devised a package which is cheaper, uses less packaging 
material and is easier to recycle which involves the use 
of monomaterial plastics for either the tray or the lid or 
for both, the lidded tray being flow wrapped with a laminated 
aluminium film. The prior art describes packages having a tray and a lid being wrapped 
together. A package having separate tray and lid placed together in a 
flow wrapped film is known from EP-A-0391 712. Another wrapped package 
disclosed in FR-A-0894 330, which document forms the basis for the two 
part of claim 1, comprises a tray with a lid having a window, the tray 
and lid being wrapped in a plastics pouch. None of these documents discloses a 
package like the one according to the invention or are solving the problems 
discussed above.  
 The present invention provides a package comprising a plastics tray 
and a plastics lid the plastics lid being sealed to the plastics tray 
characterised in 
that the plastics tray and the plastics lid are flow wrapped 
with or bagged in a laminated aluminium film pouch and that 
either or both of the plastics tray and the plastics lid are 
made of monomaterial plastics. By "monomaterial plastics" in this invention we mean a material 
made of a single layer of a polymeric plastics material 
and not a laminate so that there is no bonding together of  
 
the layers as there is when a plurality of plastics materials 
are used to form a laminated structure. The thickness of the 
tray may be, for instance, from 600 to 900 microns and the 
thickness of the lid may be, for instance, from 30 to 60 
microns. The plastics material that is used for the tray and the lid 
of the package may be any polymeric plastics material which 
can
