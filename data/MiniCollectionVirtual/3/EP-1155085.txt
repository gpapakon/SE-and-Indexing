<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a molding material containing, relative to the sum of components A to G totaling 100 weight percent: a) up to 100 weight percent of the molding material of at least one polycondensate as component A; b) 1 to 10 weight percent of at least one particle-shaped graft polymer with a glass transition temperature in the soft phase below 0 DEG  C and a mean particle size ranging from 50 to 1000 nm as component B; c) 1 to 10 weight percent of at least one copolymer as component C consisting of monomers: c1) 50 to 90 weight percent of at least one vinyl aromatic monomer as component C1 and c2) 10 to 50 weight percent acrylnitrile and/or methacrylnitrile as component C2, relative to component C; d) 0.01 to 15 weight percent of a polycarbonate as component D; e) 0.01 to 10 weight percent of a polymer different from component B as component E; f) 0 to 20 weight percent of a polyester different from component A as component F; g) 0.1 to 10 weight percent of  conventional additives such as carbon black, UV stabilizers, nucleating agents, transesterification stabilizers, oxidation retardants, lubricants and mold-release agents as component G. The invention also relates to the molded parts and composites and to the utilization of said molded materials, molded parts and composites.
