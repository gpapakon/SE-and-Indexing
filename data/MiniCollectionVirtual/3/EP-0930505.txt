<ABSTRACT>
A rolling bearing unit for the hub of a vehicle wheel
has an outer rotating race (10), a radially inner

stationary race (11), a sealing device (16) between
the races (10, 11), and a device for measuring the

rotating speed of the outer race (10). The measuring
device has an encoder wheel (13) in the form of a

radially oriented annular disc of magnetised plastic
or rubber material. The rolling bearing has a

metallic annular insert (14) adapted for fixing the
encoder wheel (13) to the outer race (10); the insert

(14) forms: an outer cylindrical portion (14a) for
forcefully fitting to an outer surface (10a) of the

outer race (10) ; a radial wall portion (14b, 14d)
that concurs in forming an annular seat for

accommodating the encoder wheel, and that extends
radially inwardly so as to co-operate with the

sealing device (16) to close the gap between the
races (10, 11); and a joining portion (14c) between

the outer cylindrical portion (14a) and the radial
wall portion (14b, 14d), on which an axial thrust is

applied for performing the force fitting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a roller
bearing unit, in particular for the hub of a vehicle
wheel, of the kind equipped with a sealing device and
a device for measuring the rotating speed of the
outer race.Known measuring devices of the aforementioned
type comprise an encoder wheel in the form of an
annular disc of magnetised plastic or rubber
material, which is rotatably secured to the rotating
ring of the bearing. In some well-known types of
device, the encoder wheel is forcefully fitted onto
the rotating ring of the bearing or onto an element
fixedly connected to it. It has however been found
that encoder wheels of this type do not stand up very
well to the stress to which they are subjected when
they are forcefully fitted; furthermore, encoder
wheels fitted in this way are exposed to the action
of external contaminating agents such as water, dust,
mud, metal particles from nearby brake devices etc;
when said contaminating agents come into contact with
said encoder wheels their performance tends to be
impaired and the signal produced by a sensor which
picks up variations in magnetic flow generated by the 
rotating encoder wheel can be adversely affected.In other well-known types of device, such as
that described in EP-A-0 675 364 or Italian patent application No.
T097A000371 (not yet available to the public as of
the date of the present application) the encoder
wheel is integrated into the sealing device of the
bearing unit. While this kind of alternative
presents certain advantages in some respects, the
encoder wheel is however fitted in such a way as to
present a restricted surface for the sensor to read.An aim of the present invention is to achieve a
robust, reliable arrangement which ensures that the
encoder wheel does not risk being damaged during
assembly, transport or use.Another aim of the present invention is to
achieve an arrangement of reduced overall dimensions,
housing the encoder wheel between the axial
dimensions of the bearing unit.Another aim of the present invention is to
obtain maximum intensity from the magnetic field
generated by the encoder wheel, and to obtain a
larger reading surface for the sensor in use facing
the encoder wheel.Another aim of the present invention is to
propose a method which can also be applied to 
conventional bearing units, without having to modify
them in order to mount an encoder wheel onto said
conventional bearing units.A further aim of the present invention is to
achieve an arrangement which protects the magnetised
wheel from sudden extreme changes
