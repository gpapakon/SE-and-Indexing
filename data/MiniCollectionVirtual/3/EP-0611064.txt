<ABSTRACT>
A printed circuit board (8) is provided with a solder 
pad (12,14) for wave soldering a surface mount device (16) 

with its longitudinal axis in a direction perpendicular to 
the solder wave. A leading solder pad (12) is not wider 

than the surface mount device (16). A trailing solder 
pad (14) is wider than the surface mount device (16), 

thereby ensuring that the trailing pad (14) is sufficiently 
wet by the solder wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to wave soldering of 
surface mount devices to a printed circuit board, and more 
specifically to the size and configuration of the solder 
pads when a surface mounted device is oriented on a printed 
circuit board with its axis parallel to the direction the 
circuit board moves through a wave soldering machine. Prior art wave soldering of a surface mount device 
(SMD) on a printed circuit board involves mounting the 
device with its contact ends on equally sized solder pads. 
The solder pads and SMD are oriented such that the axis of 
the SMD is perpendicular to the direction that the PC board 
will pass over the solder wave in a wave solder machine. 
This placement allows each end of the SMD to directly 
receive molten solder without the SMD blocking the flow of 
solder which would otherwise prevent the deposit of solder 
on the blocked pad. An important aim in the design and layout of printed 
circuit boards is to minimize their size. Therefore, 
components must be packed together in the most efficient way 
possible. The requirement to orient all SMDs perpendicular 
to the wave-solder direction has limited packing efficiency 
in the prior art. Thus, it is very desirable to allow 
placement of an SMD with any orientation and with a 
sufficient amount of solder being deposited on each solder 
pad by wave soldering. A printed circuit board assembly and a printed circuit board 
according to the invention are defined in claims 1 and 4, 
respectively. Claim 5 is related to a method of wave soldering 
a surface mount device to a printed circuit board. To increase the layout efficiency of a printed circuit 
board, the surface mount device body axis is placed parallel 
to the direction the PC board passes through the solder 
wave. In order to get a sufficient amount of molten solder 
to wet the surface of the trailing solder pad, the size of 
the leading solder pad is decreased so it is not wider than 
the surface mount device. The trailing solder pad is 
widened so that a sufficient amount of solder is deposited 
on its surface.  
 Briefly, the present 
invention includes a printed circuit board, a surface mount 
device having a first end and a second end, a first solder 
pad deposited on the printed circuit board having a width 
not greater than the width of the first end and a second 
solder pad deposited on the printed circuit board having a 
width greater than the width of the second end. The first 
and second pads are oriented so that the first end is wave 
soldered
