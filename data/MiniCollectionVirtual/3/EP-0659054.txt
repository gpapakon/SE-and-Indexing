<ABSTRACT>
A floor treatment machine has a chassis (1), a floor treatment unit and an operation and/or control unit (11) arranged at the back of the machine. The floor treatment unit mounted on the chassis has a container unit with at least one container (14, 15) for receiving liquid and/or solid substances, as well as further units such as accumulators (6), motors (4), pumps (7), fans and collectors. At least one container (15) of the container unit is hung in a variable position and/or is deformable, so that the height of its upper edge above the floor is variable.

(11) provided at the rear of the machine, with the floor 
treatment unit provided on a chassis including a container 

unit having at least one container (14, 15, 16; 
26, 31) to accommodate liquid and/or solid substances and 

other units, such as batteries (6), motors (4), pumps 
(7), fans and separators, wherein at least one container 

(15, 16; 26, 31) of the container unit is adjustably 
suspended and/or changeable in shape, allowing the height 

of its top edge above the floor to be varied.
