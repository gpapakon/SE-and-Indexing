<ABSTRACT>
A CD package made from a foldable flat material blank has at least two walls joined to each other by their transverse sides. At least one wall has fastening means foldable against an adjacent wall for fastening a CD on an inner side of the wall. The wall having the fastening means has marginal flaps joined to each other by their opposite longitudinal sides, foldable against the inner side of the wall and linkable thereto. The fastening means have fastening flaps joined to the other longitudinal sides of the marginal flaps. The fastening flaps have marginal holding means for segments of a CD positioned over the inner side of the wall which extend up to the junction of the fastening flaps with the marginal flaps. The fastening flaps stretch over the CD when in a folded fastening position and release the CD when they are folded away from each other into a release position.

surface towards which an adjacent wall (2) is foldable, 
characterized in that said wall (1) including said 

fastening means comprises lateral flaps (6, 7) hinged to 
opposed longitudinal sides, said lateral flaps being 

folded towards the inner surface and connected thereto, 
and said fastening means include fastening flaps (10, 11) 

hinged to the longitudinal sides of said lateral flaps 
facing one another which fastening flaps, for segments of 

a CD positioned above the inner surface, said segments 
being provided on said lateral flaps (6, 7), comprise 

lateral accommodations (12, 13) extending up to their 
hinge line (8, 9) to said lateral flaps, said fastening 

flaps (10, 11) covering over the CD in a fastening 
position folded towards each other and releasing it in a 

releasing position folded away from each other.
