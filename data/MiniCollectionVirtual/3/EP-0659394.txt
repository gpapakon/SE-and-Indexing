<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a treatment process for obtaining a non-permanent reshaping of human keratinous fibres, especially hair (setting), which consists in (i) bringing a gas containing water vapour and whose temperature is at least 75 DEG C into contact, for a period not exceeding 2 minutes, with human keratinous fibres maintained under mechanical tension and to which a composition containing at least one polysaccharide and/or one polysaccharide derivative, optionally in combination with at least one silicone and/or one oil, has been applied, (ii) cooling the fibres thus treated, and lastly (iii) eliminating the mechanical tension which was applied to the fibres. Hair is thereby obtained which displays long-lasting attractive curls and exceptional cosmetic properties of softness and smoothness.

<CLAIMS>
Treatment process for the non-permanent reshaping
of human keratinous fibres, especially hair,

characterized in that it consists (i) in bringing a gas
containing water vapour, and the temperature of which is

at least 75째C, into contact for a time not exceeding 2
minutes with human keratinous fibres maintained under

mechanical tension and to which a composition containing
at least one polysaccharide and/or polysaccharide

derivative has been applied, (ii) in cooling the fibres
thus treated, and lastly (iii) in removing the mechanical

tension which was applied to the fibres.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said gas has a temperature above or equal to

85째C.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the said temperature is between 85째C and 150째C.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the said gas is brought

into contact with the fibre to be reshaped for a time
ranging from 0.01 second to 2 minutes.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the said time is between 0.01 second and 30 seconds.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the said time is between 1 second and 10 seconds.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the application of the gas

is repeated several times on the same fibre.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said gas contains only 

water vapour.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the said gas contains water vapour

and at least one other compound in gas or vapour form.
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the said gas contains water vapour and air.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the polysaccharide is

chosen from starches and celluloses, optionally modified,
as well their derivatives.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at least one silicone

and/or oil is applied in addition to the keratinous
fibres before they are brought into contact with the gas.
