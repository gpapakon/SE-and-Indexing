<ABSTRACT>
Peracetic acid solutions tend to decompose slowly during storage. The storage stability of the peracetic acid therein can be improved by introduction of an effective amount of an aliphatic alcohol ethoxylate wetting agent which has an EO number of greater than 4 and preferably from 8 to 20. The wetting agent is preferably derived from an alcohol containing from 8 to 18 carbons. Desirably at least 0.1 % and particularly from 0.5 to 5 % alcohol ethoxylate is incorporated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stabilised peracid 
solutions and their production. Soluble peracids have a number of attractive 
properties, including oxidative and broad spectrum 
biocidal properties. As a consequence, they have been 
employed or proposed for use as oxidising agents in 
chemical synthesis reactions, as bleaching agents in the 
bleaching or cleansing of laundry and other substrates 
and as disinfectants or sterilisers for especially liquid 
media or solid surfaces. One peracid which is widely available and suitable for 
the above-mentioned uses is peracetic acid which is 
usually produced in an aqueous solution by reaction 
between acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, optionally in 
the presence of a catalyst such as a strong acid, 
including sulphuric, phosphoric and/or phosphonic acids. 
In a number of commercially available peracetic acid-containing 
compositions, the peracetic acid is present in 
equilibrium with the two reactants from which it is 
produced and water. Although such compositions may be 
used immediately after their production, they are often 
stored for considerable periods during their distribution 
and/or by the end user. During storage there is a 
tendency for some decomposition of the peroxygen species 
to occur, thereby progressively impairing the 
effectiveness of the composition for its desired purpose  
 
or requiring the use of an increased amount to attain a 
desired concentration of active ingredient. Plainly, 
therefore, it is desirable to find ways of improving the 
stability of peracid compositions, by which is meant ways 
of ameliorating or inhibiting the rate at which the 
measured concentration of peroxygen compounds and 
particularly peracetic acid falls during storage. One method of apparently improving the peracid 
stability in peracid compositions is described by Henkel 
in British Patent Specification no 1 580 561, which 
comprises employing a higher concentration of hydrogen 
peroxide relative to the peracetic acid than an 
equilibrium concentration. Essentially the same concept 
is disclosed in European Patent 0 024 125 to L'Air 
Liquide, but augmented by simultaneously diluting the 
acid catalyst below a minimal level so as to retard the 
rate of re-equilibration of the composition. By using 
excess hydrogen peroxide inventors seek to balance 
peracetic acid generation arising from slow re-equilibration 
against its rate of decomposition. 
Disadvantageously, the use of a considerable excess of 
one of the reagents inevitably increases the
