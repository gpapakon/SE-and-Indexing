<ABSTRACT>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a cooled bipropellant thruster (70) for controlling the on-orbit position and orientation of a spacecraft is provided. The cooled bipropellant thruster (70) uses a liquid fuel and liquid oxidizer. The liquid fuel is decomposed in a first chamber (72) with a catalytic bed of decomposition material (74) and produces at least one reaction gas, which flows to the second reaction chamber (90). The second reaction chamber (90) is heated by the reaction gas, but is cooled by liquid oxidizer flowing through cooling passages (92, 94, 98, and 102), which brings the oxidizer into a heat exchange relationship with the second reaction chamber (90). During the heat exchange relationship, heat is transferred from the second reaction chamber (90) to the oxidizer and the oxidizer transforms into a gas. The gaseous oxidizer is fed into a second reaction chamber (90) to secondarily react with the reaction gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to rocket
propulsion systems and more particularly, to rocket
propulsion systems for placing and maintaining spacecraft
in planetary orbits. Although the invention has broad
application to unmanned spacecraft, it is particularly
concerned with launching and maintaining satellites in
geosynchronous orbits. Placing a geosynchronous satellite
into orbit typically involves three principal mission
phases. First, the satellite is placed in the low earth
orbit not far above the earth's atmosphere, either as a
part of payload of the space shuttle vehicle or on a
conventional non-reusable rocket vehicle. In the second
phase, the satellite orbit has its apogee or highest point
raised in altitude by one or more rocket "burns" at a
select point in orbit, until the apogee is approximately
at geosynchronous altitude. Finally, the satellite is
given an apogee "kick," i.e., a further rocket burn at
apogee that circularizes the orbit at geosynchronous
altitude.Once in orbit, rocket engines will be called on
for two further functions: station keeping and attitude 
control, which are sometimes referred to collectively as
reaction control systems (RCS) functions. Satellites are
usually required to maintain a particular "station" with
respect to the earth's surface. Maintaining this station
requires the expenditure of energy, even though the orbit
is theoretically self-sustaining and geosynchronous.
Various factors, such as the non-spherical nature of the
earth, gravitational influences of the moon and sun, and
so forth, require that the orbit be corrected from time to
time if the required station is to be maintained.
Attitude control is simply the use of multiple rocket
engines on the spacecraft to maintain a particular angular
attitude of the vehicle. This may be needed, for example,
to point an antenna or other sensor at the earth, the sun,
or a star.Rocket engines associated with orbiting
spacecraft may be called upon to perform the various
functions of orbital transfer, station keeping and
attitude control. Unfortunately, the performance
characteristics required for these functions are not
identical. A figure of merit often used in comparison of
rocket engines is the specific impulse, Isp, which is
defined as the thrust developed by an engine per unit of
propellant weight flow rate. If the thrust is measured in
pounds and the flow rate in pounds per second, then the
units of measurement of specific impulse are seconds. The
specific impulse is analogous to miles-per-gallon figure
for an

A propulsion system for a spacecraft, the propulsion system comprising:

an apogee engine (10) used for an apogee kick phase of a mission of
said spacecraft;
a thruster (70) for station keeping and attitude control of said spacecraft,
said thruster (70) comprising:
a first tank (12) of a non-cryogenic fuel consisting of essentially pure
hydrazine which is in a liquid state;
a second tank (14) containing a non-cryogenic oxidizer which is in a
liquid state, said oxidizer being selected from the group of nitrogen tetroxide, liquid

oxygen, nitrogen trifluoride, nitrogen tetrafluoride or combinations thereof;
said hydrazine tank (12) and oxidizer tank (14) supplying fuel to said
apogee engine (10) during the apogee kick phase of the mission of said spacecraft;
said station keeping and attitude control thruster (70) being fed by the
same hydrazine and oxidizer tanks (12,14) during station keeping and attitude control

phases of the mission of said spacecraft, said thruster (70) including:
a first body defining a first reaction chamber (72) having therein a catalytic bed of

decomposition material (74);
a second body having an inner surface defining a second reaction
chamber (90);
means for feeding (18) the liquid hydrazine from the tank thereof to the
first reaction chamber (72) to react exothermically with the catalytic bed of

decomposition material (74) and produce a first group of reaction gases, the reaction
gases flowing from the first reaction chamber (72) into the second reaction chamber

(90) and heating the second body; 
at least one passageway (92) formed in the second body, said
passageway having an inlet and an outlet, said inlet being coupled to receive the

non-cryogenic oxidizer while in a liquid state from the oxidizer tank, with the liquid
oxidizer flowing through a first portion of the passageway to receive sufficient heat

from the second body to initially transform a fraction of the non-cryogenic liquid
oxidizer to a heated gas phase, said oxidizer continuing to flow through other

passageway portions (94, 98, 102) to receive sufficient heat from the second body to
substantially completely transform the oxidizer to a gas phase, the phase change of

the oxidizer from liquid to gas serving to cool the thruster (70) during low thrust
burns for station keeping and attitude control maneuvers of said spacecraft; and,
means for feeding (18') the gaseous oxidizer from the outlet of the
passageway into the second reaction chamber to react as a gas with the reaction gases

flowing from the first chamber to provide sufficient energy to perform station keeping
and attitude control of said spacecraft.
The system of Claim 1 wherein the liquid oxidizer flows in the
passageway (102) sufficiently to transform the oxidizer into superheated gas at a

temperature of about 250°F (121°C to 149 °C).
The system of Claim 1 wherein the thruster further comprises:

flow swirler means (110) in the passageways (92, 94, 98, and 102) for
swirling the oxidizer to promote heat transfer and removal of the oxidizer from the

passageway (102).
The system of Claim 1 wherein the thruster further comprises: 

a plurality of elongated substantially parallel conduits in the second
body and connected together at ends thereof to form a serpentine flow channel f

The system of Claim 4 wherein the injectors (108) of the thruster (70)
serve to inject the oxidizer gas at an angle into the second reaction chamber to mix

with reaction gas flowing from a central reaction gas injector (80).
