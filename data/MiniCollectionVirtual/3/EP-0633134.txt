<ABSTRACT>
In an intaglio printing machine including a plate cylinder (1), a printing cylinder and a wiping cylinder (5), the plate cylinder (1) and wiping cylinder (5) are each driven by their own motor (M1, M5). The two motors are connected together by a control unit (7) designed to control the speeds of the two cylinders (1, 5) so that their relative peripheral speed is maintained at a constant value if the speed of the motor (M1) driving the plate cylinder is altered.

<CLAIMS>
Intaglio printing machine comprising a plate 
cylinder (1) and a wiping cylinder (5) which is in 

contact with the plate cylinder (1), and of which the 
peripheral rotational speed at the zone of contact is 

opposite that of the plate cylinder (1), the latter being 
driven in rotation by a first motor (M1), characterized 

in that the wiping cylinder (5) is driven by a second 
motor (M5), the two motors being connected by a control 

unit (7) designed to control the speeds of the two motors 
(M1, M5) such that their rela
tive peripheral speed at the 
zone of contact is kept at a constant value independently 

of the speed of the first motor (M1). 
Printing machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the relative peripheral speed lies 

between 2.5 and 3.5 m/s.
