catalysts: 1) tertiary and quaternary amino ion exchange
resins; 2) tetraalkylammonium halides supported on silica
gel; 3) divinylbenzene/4-vinylpyridine copolymer based
resins; 4) triorganophosphine oxide supported on an organic
resin; or 5) triorganophosphine compounds.The prior art is represented by one or more of the
