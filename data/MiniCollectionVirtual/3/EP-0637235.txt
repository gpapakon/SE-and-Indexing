<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to pharmaceutical 
liquid suspension formulations suitable for oral 
administration In another aspect, it pertains to 
sustained release suspensions. In yet another aspect, 
this invention pertains to theophylline formulations. Theophylline is an antiasthmatic drug with a 
narrow therapeutic window. It is available in a number 
of different dosage forms including conventional 
tablets, sustained release tablets, elixirs and 
suspensions. The currently available suspensions 
settle to the bottom of the container upon standing for 
several days. If the container is not shaken 
adequately, the contents will not resuspend in a 
uniform fashion and the amount of theophylline present 
per dose will vary. European Patent Application 0,101,418 
(Kallstrand et al.) discloses what is said to be a 
controlled release pharmaceutical mixture which masks 
bad taste and increases stability of an active 
substance, characterized in that an encapsulated active 
substance is combined with a substance controlling the 
release of the active substance. The release-controlling 
substance is a carbohydrate or a 
carbohydrate-related material and microencapsulated 
theophylline is among the enumerated actives. UK Pat. No. GB 2166651B discloses a 
suspension of pharmasomes containing theophylline. The 
suspension vehicle consists of (by weight): 85.3% 70% 
sorbitol solution, 0.7% Avicel RC 591, 0.3% potassium 
sorbate, 2.7% of a solution containing titanium dioxide 
25% in 70% sorbitol, 0.01% simethicone 10% emulsion,  
 
10.8% glycerine, 0.3% citric acid and 0.04% sodium 
lauryl sulphate. This invention provides an aqueous 
pharmaceutical suspension for oral administration which 
suspension, based on the total weight of the 
suspension, comprises from about 0.1 to 15 percent by 
weight of a particulate medicament with an average 
particle size of less than about 150 µm; about 0.02 
percent to about 5 percent by weight of a 
pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agent; about 0.02 
to about 0.10 percent by weight of a hydrocolloid gum; 
about 0.2 to about 2.0 percent by weight of colloidal 
silicon dioxide; about 0.1 to 0.3 percent by weight of 
an antifoaming agent; a carbohydrate which is dissolved 
in the suspension; and water; the suspension being 
further characterized in that the medicament remains 
suspended uniformly for a period of at least about 90 
days when tested according to the Test Method. Due to the presence of the hydrocolloid gum 
and the colloidal silicon dioxide, the suspension of

<CLAIMS>
An aqueous pharmaceutical suspension for oral 
administration which suspension, based on the total 

weight of the suspension, comprises:
 
   from 0.1 to 15 percent by weight of a particulate 

medicament with an average particle size of less than 
about 150 µm;
 
   from 0.02 percent to 5 percent by weight of a 

pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agent;
 
   from 0.02 to 0.10 percent by weight of a 

hydrocolloid gum;
 
   from 0.2 to 2.0 percent by weight of colloidal 

silicon dioxide;
 
   from 0.1 to 0.3 percent by weight of an antifoaming 

agent;
 
   a carbohydrate which is dissolved in the suspension; 

and
 
   water;
 
   the suspension being further characterised in that 

the medicament remains suspended uniformly for a period 
of at least about 90 days when tested according to the 

Test Method. 
A suspension as claimed in Claim 1 in which the 
hydrocolloid gum is xanthan gum. 
A suspension as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in 
which the colloidal silicon dioxide is present in an 

amount of from 0.2 to 0.8 percent by weight based on the 
total weight of the suspension. 
A suspension as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the particulate medicament has an average particle 

size of between 50 µm and 125 µm. 
A suspension as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the medicament is present in an amount of from 1 to 

10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the 
suspension.  

 
A suspension as claimed in Claim 5 in which the 
medicament is present in an amount of from 2 to 7 percent 

by weight based on the total weight of the suspension. 
A suspension as claimed in any preceding Claim in 
which the medicament is in the form of a 

microencapsulated drug. 
A suspension as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6 
in which the medicament is in the form of controlled 

release polymeric particles comprising a drug and 
optionally an excipient in intimate admixture with at 

least one non-toxic polymer, with the drug and the 
excipient, if present, substantially uniformly 

distributed throughout the polymeric particle, and which 
particles have a predetermined release of the drug when 

the dissolution rate thereof is measured according to the 
Paddle Method of U.S. Pharmacopoeia XXII. 
A suspension as claimed in Claim 8 in which the non-toxic 
polymer is selected from an alkyl cellulose, a 

hydroxyalkyl cellulose, a cellulose ether, a cellulose 
ester, a nitro cellulose, a polymer of acrylic and 

methacrylic acids and esters thereof, a polyamide, a 
polycarbonate, a polyalkylene, a polyalkylene glycol, a 

polyalkylene oxide, a polyalkylene terephthalate, a 
polyvinyl alcohol, a polyvinyl ether, a polyvinyl ester, 

a polyvinyl halide, a polyvinylpyrrolidone, a 
polyglycolide, a polysiloxane, and a polyurethane. 
A suspension as claimed in Claim 9 in which the non-toxic 
polymer is cellulose acetate butyrate. 
A suspension as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the medicament comprises a drug selected from an 

antiallergic, an antiinflammatory, an antihistamine, an 
antitussive, an antibiotic, an antiarrhythmic, a
