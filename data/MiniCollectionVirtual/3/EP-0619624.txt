<ABSTRACT>
A connector body member has conductor receiving sections for 
receiving a plurality of conductive end portions of a member to be 

connected, such as a flat cable, a jumper, or a printed circuit 
board. A plurality of contacts are so mounted as to project into 

the conductor receiving sections in order to contact the conductive 
end portions of the member to be connected. A cover member for 

holding the contact between the conductive end portions of the 
member to be connected and the contacts is formed to be pivotal 

with respect to the connector body member. Each conductor 
receiving section has an opening. The cover member pivots to cover 

the openings of the conductor receiving sections. The cover member 
is also locked into the connector body member by sliding along the 

connector body member while covering the openings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector for connecting, e.g., a flat cable and, more
particularly, to a connector which allows a flat cable to be vertically placed into or removed
from the contacts of the connector.In a conventional connector for connecting a flexible board such as a flat cable, an
opening for receiving the cable is formed parallel (horizontal) to the contacts. To connect a flat
cable by using the connector of this type, therefore, it is necessary to insert the end portions
(electrodes) of the cable into the opening with the end portions arranged in line, horizontally
move the cable, and push the cable to the positions of the contacts.In this case, it is common practice to solder the end portions of the contacts away from
the cable to, e.g., a printed circuit board. Therefore, if a larger force than is necessary is
applied to the contacts when the cable is moved, the contacts may be deformed or broken. In
addition, the cable itself may also be deformed or broken under an excess load. Furthermore, it
is not easy to insert the end portions of the cable into the opening of the connector with the end
portions arranged in line, especially when the length of the cable is short.US-A-4778403 discloses a connector comprising a body member, a plurality of
contacts located in elongate grooves in the body member and the contacts having cantilever
portions extending out of the grooves for contacting conductive portions of a flat member, and
a pivotable cover member for covering the contacts and the conductive end portions of the flat
member and maintaining contact therebetween, the cover member pivoting to cover the
contacts and the flat member and sliding relative to the body member to latch therewith.To solve the above problems, a connector according to the present invention allows a
cable such as a flat cable, to be vertically placed into or removed from contacts of the
connector, thereby making easy insertion and removal possible without applying load on the
cable. According to the invention there is provided a connector comprising a body member
having spaced apart conductor receiving sections comprising a plurality of grooves each for
receiving one of a plurality of spaced apart conductive end portions of a member;
   a plurality of contacts being mounted on said body member, each contact having a
portion lying within an associated groove for making contact with an associated end portion of
the member; and
   a pivotable cover member for covering said contacts and the conductive end

<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising a body member (10) having spaced apart conductor
receiving sections (11) comprising a plurality of grooves (13) each for receiving one of a

plurality of spaced apart conductive end portions (110) of a member (100);

   a plurality of contacts (20) being mounted on said body member (10), each contact
(20) having a portion (22) lying within an associated groove (13) for making contact with

an associated end portion (110) of the member (100); and

   a pivotable cover member (30) for covering said contacts (20) and the conductive
end portions (110) of said member (100) and maintaining contact therebetween,

   said conductor receiving sections being provided with openings (12) through which
the end portions of the member are placed for contacting said contacts,

   said cover member (30) pivoting to cover said openings (12) and bring the
conductive end portions (110) of the member into contact with the contacts (20) within the

grooves (13), and sliding with the openings covered to thereby latch with said body
member (10).
A connector as claimed in claim 1 wherein the cover member (30) has elongate ribs
on the face thereof which covers the openings (12), the ribs entering the conductor

receiving sections when the cover is moved to a position covering the openings (12) to
urge the conductive end portions of the member (100) into contact with respective contacts

(20) within the conductor receiving sections (11).
A connector according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the grooves (13) are arranged
mutually in parallel at intervals matching the distances between the end portions of said

conductor receiving sections.
A connector according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein each of said contacts
comprises a terminal portion (21) extending out from said body member, and a leaf spring

portion (22) for making contact with end portions of said member.
A connector according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said cover member
comprises a pair of arm portions (31) and a cover portion (32), and each of said arm 

portions is pivotable relative to said body member, and said cover portion is slidable in
said conductor receiving sections (11), with the opening covered.
A connector according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said body member has
a latching ridge (33) at a rear surface thereof which latches with a protrusion (14)

extending into space above the openings of said conductor receiving section when said
cover member slides in said conductor receiving sections.
A connector as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the cover can be
pivoted through 90° to allow the conductive end portions (110) to be placed vertically into

and removed vertically from the contacts (20).
