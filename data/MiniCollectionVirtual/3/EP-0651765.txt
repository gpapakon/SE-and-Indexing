<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel analogs of parathyroid hormone and
parathyroid hormone related peptide, their synthesis by solid phase and
recombinant techniques, and their use for increasing bone mass in mammalian
subjects.Osteoporosis is the most common form of metabolic bone disease and
may be considered the symptomatic, fracture stage of bone loss
(osteopenia). Although osteoporosis may occur secondary to a number of
underlying diseases, 90% of all cases appear to be idiopathic.
Postmenopausal women are particularly at risk for idiopathic osteoporosis
(postmeno-pausal or Type I osteoporosis). Another high risk group for
idiopathic osteoporosis is the elderly of either sex (senile or Type II
osteoporosis). Osteoporosis has also been related to corticosteroid use,
immobilization or extended bed rest, alcoholism, diabetes, gonadotoxic
chemotherapy, hyperprolactinemia, anorexia nervosa, primary and secondary
amenorrhea, and oophorectomy.In the various forms of osteoporosis, bone fractures, which are the
result of bone loss that has reached the point of mechanical failure,
frequently occur. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by
fractures of the wrist and spine, while femoral neck fractures seem to be
the dominant feature of senile osteoporosis.The mechanism by which bone is lost in osteoporotics is believed to
involve an imbalance in the process by which the skeleton renews itself.
This process has been termed bone remodeling. It occurs in a series of
discrete pockets of activity. These pockets appear spontaneously within
the bone matrix on a given bone surface as a site of bone resorption.
Osteoclasts (bone dissolving or resorbing cells) are responsible for the
resorption of a portion of bone of generally constant dimension. This
resorption process is followed by the appearance of osteoblasts (bone
forming cells) which then refill with new bone the cavity left by the
osteoclasts.In a healthy adult subject, the rate at which osteoclasts and
osteoblasts are formed is such that bone formation and bone resorption are
in balance. However, in osteoporotics an imbalance in the bone remodeling
process develops which results in bone being lost at a rate faster than it 
is being made. Although this imbalance occurs to some extent in most
individuals as they age, it is much more severe and occurs at a younger age
in postmenopausal osteoporotics or following oophorectomy.There have been many attempts to treat osteoporosis with the goal of
either slowing further bone loss or, more desirably, producing a
