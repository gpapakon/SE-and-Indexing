<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to batteries which operate
reversibly at environmental temperature, and to specifically methods
for manufacturing them.With the recent tendency to design electric
equipment into micro-electronic form, batteries have been
housed in electric equipment and integrated with
electronics elements and their circuits, e.g. power
sources for memory back-up of various electric equipment.
For this reason, the demand for minimizing the size,
weight and thickness of batteries and for large energy
density is increasing. In the primary battery field,
small and light-weight batteries such as lithium
batteries are already used, but their field of
application is limited. In the field of secondary
batteries, batteries utilizing nonaqueous electrolyte,
which can be made smaller in size and weight, attract
current attention as an alternative to conventional lead
and nickel-cadmium batteries. However with nonaqueous
electrolyte, electrode active materials which can satisfy
practical physical properties such as cycle
characteristic and self-discharge characteristic have not
been found yet.In order to obtain a small and light battery having
a large energy density and a high reliability, it is
necessary to examine:
(1) Problem of electrode active material and 
electrode(2) Problem of electrolyteAs for the problem (1), the inventor examined a film
type battery, that is, a battery having unit cells with
thicknesses of 100 to 500 µm and also called a "sheet-shaped"
battery. Manufacture of metallic lithium foil
having a desirable performance was technically difficult,
so the battery manufacturing process became complicated.
Further, with secondary batteries formation of lithium
dendrite and passivation of the interface took place so
that the use of metallic lithium was restricted.
Therefore, investigations on lithium alloys such as
lithium-aluminium, lithium-lead and lithium-tin are being
carried on actively. However, these electrode cracked or
broke into fine pieces with repeated charging and
discharging, so that the cycle characteristic was not
improved because these alloys e.g. Li-Al have small
strengths. As an alternative for restricting the
formation of lithium dendrite, investigations on
selection of electrolyte salts and improvements in the
separator are being made. For the separator, it has been
attempted to restrict the formation of lithium dendrite
by laminating non-woven fabrics made of polypropylene and
non-woven fabrics made of glass fiber. However, a
substantial solution has not been found
