<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a medical compression device comprising a main part which is made of an elastic fabric and which serves to compress a leg or an arm in order to treat venous or lymphatic insufficiency. According to the invention, the main part (11; 16) is expediently continued via an elastic support band (20) consisting of an elastic braid or lace (21) covered, on the inner side, with a design (23) made of a nonslip material, the fibres constituting the braid or the lace of this band being chosen in such a way that the said band has at the same time a low elongation characteristic and exerts on the limb in question a pressure which is less than that exerted by the main part of the device in the vicinity of the said band.

A remedial support appliance for medical use on a leg or 
an arm, comprising a main portion (11 ; 16) of elasticated 

knit serving to compress the limb on which the appliance is 
worn for the purpose of treating venous or lymphatic 

insufficiency, which main portion is extended upwards by an 
elasticated garter band (20), which is formed by an 

elasticated braid or an elasticated lace (21) covered on 
the inside with a pattern (23) made of an antislip material, 

characterized in that the fibers constituting the braid 
or the lace (21) of the garter band (20) are selected in 

such a manner that said band presents an elongation 
characteristic [traction force as a function of percentage 

elongation] of a shallow slope and simultaneously exerts 

pressure on the limb in question that is less than the 
pressure exerted by the main portion (11; 16) in the 

vicinity of the garter band (20). 
A remedial support appliance according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the antislip pattern (23) of the 

elasticated garter band (20) is implemented in the form of 
at least one band (23.1), line (23.3), or succession of 

touching stitches (23.2), continuously disposed on and 
extending circumferentially around the inside periphery of 

said garter band, with the total height of the antislip 
pattern lying essentially in the range 1 cm to 6 cm. 
A remedial support appliance according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the antislip pattern (23) is constituted 

by two superposed bands (23.1) each about 1.5 cm 
high, the two bands being separated by an uncovered portion 

of the elasticated lace or braid (21) that is about 1 cm 
high.  

 
A remedial support appliance according to claim 2 or 
claim 3, characterized in that the antislip pattern (23) is 

made of silicone or the like deposited continuously or 
discontinuously on the inside periphery of the elasticated 

garter band (20). 
A remedial support appliance according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the fibers constituting 

the elasticated lace or braid (21) are selected in such 
a manner that the elongation characteristic of the 

elasticated garter band (20) corresponds, above an elongation 
of 15%, substantially to 10% elongation per Newton 

exerted in traction, and that the elasticated garter band 
(20) exerts pressure (P) on the limb in question that lies 

essentially in the range 0.1 P0 to 0.8 P0 where P0 is the 
pressure exerted on the limb by the main portion (11; 16) 

of the appliance in the vicinity of said garter band. 
A remedial support appliance according to claim 5, 
characterized in that the elasticated lace or braid (21) 

of the elasticated garter band (20) is cut to a 
circumferential length that is determined as a function of 

various different sizes, in particular five sizes, and the 
pressure (P) exerted by said garter band lies in a range 

that narrows with increasing size. 
A remedial support appliance according to claim 6, 
characterized in 
that the values of pressure (P) exerted by 
the elasticated garter band (20) lie preferably in the 

following ranges 0.2 P0 to 0.6 P0, 0.4 P0 to 0.75 P0, and 
0.45 P0 to 0.8 P0 respectively for the three commonest 

sizes. 
A remedial support appliance according to any one of 
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the elasticated lace  

 
or braid (21) is made from an elasticated fiber and from 

textile fibers of textured or continuous type. 
A remedial support appliance according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the elasticated fiber is an 

elasthanne or an elastodiene, and the textile fibers are 
made of polyamide, cotton or the like. 
A remedial support appliance according to claim 8 or 
claim 9, characterized in that the elasticated braid (21) 

is woven or knitted.
