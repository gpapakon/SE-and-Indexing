<ABSTRACT>
A solid woven tubular prosthesis (10) having sufficient inherent wall stiffness so as to be radially self-supporting. The solid woven prosthesis (10) is capable of being formed with a smooth, continuous inner wall that improves the hemodynamic flow with respect to conventional woven prosthesis, thereby facilitating the flow of fluid therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tubular prostheses,
and, more particularly, to woven tubular prostheses having
increased wall stiffness.In the past, tubular prostheses have commonly been
manufactured by, for example, weaving a plurality of warp
yarns and a plurality of fill yarns into a tubular fabric.
Such products, however, typically lack sufficient radial
stiffness to maintain an open lumen, i.e., if unsupported,
they will radially collapse. The tendency to radially
collapse or kink is particularly problematic to a surgeon
during implantation of the prosthesis.Conventional weaves used for vascular grafts and
other medical devices are known as simple weaves, i.e.,
one-ply weaves. These types of constructions are
inherently strong with respect to burst pressure, but
suffer from the above-mentioned kinking and collapsing
tendencies, as well as the tendency to ravel at the ends,
making it difficult to properly hold sutures. Additionally,
the one-ply structure has inherent limitations as to
the properties which can be engineered into the final woven
product. For example, simple weaves do not stretch well
radially or longitudinally and, further, possess only a
simple pore structure due to the single layer.To overcome these characteristics, prior art
prostheses are typically crimped at equidistant lengths
along their longitudinal axis. The crimping is believed to
provide the prosthesis with sufficient radial stiffness to
maintain an open lumen. The crimping additionally provides
a degree of longitudinal compliance to the prosthesis. Crimping, however, is not without its disadvantages.
For example, the crimps create a plurality of
irregularities along the inner wall of the prosthesis that
may create blood flow disturbances. These blood flow
disturbances become more pronounced and consequently less
acceptable as the diameter of the prosthesis is reduced.
In addition, thrombi can accumulate in the valleys of the
crimps, tending to form hyperplastic pockets.An alternative prior art technique for providing
radial stiffness to a woven prosthesis involves the use
of a stiffening component. Specifically, the fabric is
woven around a suitable stiffener or, alternatively, such
a stiffener is secured to either the interior or exterior
of the prosthesis following weaving. The use of a
stiffener, however, creates its own drawbacks. For
example, tissue ingrowth may be hindered by the stiffener,
the porosity of the prosthesis may be affected by the
stiffener and, finally, the ability to suture the
prosthesis to the host

A tubular prosthesis (10) for implantation in a
patients's body, comprising:


a woven fabric having a plurality of superposed
plies and including provision to aid resistance to

ravelling; wherein

the plies include an outer ply, an intermediate
ply, and an inner ply, each of the plies including a

plurality of circumferentially extending fill yarns (14a, 14b, 14c) and
a plurality of longitudinally extending warp yarns (12);

wherein each of the yarns (12) extending in one direction
continuously passes through at least two adjacent

plies, wherein the plies have a porosity sufficient to
allow ingrowth of tissue while limiting leakage of

fluid therefrom, characterised in that: the outer ply is formed
from a filamentous material for enhanced tissue

attachment, the intermediate ply is formed from a
fusible material to aid ravel resistance, and the inne
r
ply is formed from a bioresorbable material to aid in

healing.

each of the warp yarns continuously passes through at

least two adjacent plies.

wherein the woven fabric has a thickness of from 0.5mm

to 1.25mm.
A prosthesis according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
wherein the woven fabric is heat-set whereby the woven

fabric undergoes a period of controlled shrinkage.
A prosthesis according to claim 4, wherein
the woven fabric is heat-set in an elastically

compressed position to provide the woven fabric with
longitudinal compliance.

claim, wherein the outer ply is formed from a textured 

material to facilitate tissue attachment.
A prosthesis according to any preceding
claim, wherein at least one of the warp yarns is an

elastomeric polymer.
