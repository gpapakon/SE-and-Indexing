<ABSTRACT>
The device for holding the ends of the turns of a stator winding in an electricity generating machine comprises an inner ring (15) and a segmented outer ring (10). The stator winding, which consists of lower bars (5) and upper bars (6), is supported at the end on the said outer ring (10) which [lacuna] in turn by brackets (8) which are fastened to the end of the machine. The lower and upper bars are spaced apart from one another by flexible compression tubes (13) which are filled with synthetic resin. The inner ring (15) consists of two rings, having a closed inner wedge ring (15b), an outer, preferably multi-element wedge ring (15b) and supporting segments (15c), it being possible to clamp the two wedge rings to one another axially. A winding overhang support which is constructed in such a manner complies with all the practical requirements and can also be reclamped subsequently.

Device for holding the ends of the turns of a 
stator winding in a dynamoelectric machine, comprising 

a rotor (1) and a stator, which stator has a laminated 
core (2) with end-side stator core end plates (3), 

there being arranged in the laminated core in slots a 
stator winding (5,6) which has bottom and top bars and 

whose ends overlap the laminated core (2) axially, 
means (13) being provided for spacing the bottom and 

top bars (5,6), which holder has an inner ring (15) 
which fits closely, directly or with the inclusion of a 

separator, against the ends of the turns of the stator 
winding (5,6), which ends expand like an internal 

taper, and which has a multipart external support which 
is supported by brackets (8) on the end face of the 

laminated core (2), characterized in that the external 
support has a multipart outer ring (10) consisting of 

ring segments [(10 [lacuna], 10b, 10c,...) detachably 

connected to one another, in that the ring segments are 
partially situated at the free end of the brackets (8) 

in slots (9) which extend in the circumferential 
direction and are aligned with one another, in that the 

inner ring (15) consists of a closed inner conical ring 
(15b), a single-part or multipart outer conical ring 

(15a) and support segments (15c), the conical surfaces 
on the two conical rings (15a, 15b) extending in the 

direction of the ends of the turns of the stator 
winding (5, 6), which ends expand like an internal 

taper, and in that the two conical rings (15a, 15b) can 
be braced axially against one another. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that all the brackets (8) are connected to a common 

annular plate (20) which extends orthogonally relative 
to the longitudinal axis (17) of the machine and is 

detachably fastened to the free end faces of the 
brackets (8). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the ring segments (10a, 10b, 10c...) of the outer 

ring (10) are also bolted to the annular plate (20).  
 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that pressure hoses (13) which are 

filled with curable synthetic resin for the purpose of 
support and mutual spacing of the stator winding 

conductors (5, 6) are drawn into the spacings between 

the bottom and top bars. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that glass fibre strands or glass 

fibre rovings which are impregnated with curable 
synthetic resin for the purpose of support and mutual 

spacing of the stator winding conductors (5, 6) are 
drawn into the spacings between the bottom (5) and top 

bars (6). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the two conical rings (15a, 15b) 

can be braced axially against one another by means of 
clamping bolts (18) and setscrews (19), it being 

possible to screw the clamping bolts (18) into the 
support segments (15c), and the setscrews (19) being 

supported on the outwardly directed end faces of the 
said support segments (15c).
