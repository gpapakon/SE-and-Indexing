<ABSTRACT>
A swirl adjusting device for air and combustion gases has a plurality of flexible tubes (3) with free ends (4) adjacent to the burner nozzle (2). The inclination of said free ends (4) in relation to the axis (9) of the burner may be adjusted during operation of the same. For that purpose, the ends of the flexible tubes (3) away from the burner nozzle are mounted in a common support (5) which is rotatively and/or axially movably mounted in the burner housing. The free ends (4) of the flexible tubes may also be swivelled and/or moved in their axial direction in the primary air channel.

<CLAIMS>
A swirl adjusting device for air and combustion gases to be 
used in a burner for burning powdery or fine-grained, liquid 

and/or gaseous fuels, in particular a rotary tubular kiln 
comprising at least one primary air channel (1) and at least 

one burning nozzle (2), characterized in that the primary air 
channel contains a plurality of flexible tubes (3) whose ends 

facing away from the burner nozzle (2) are mounted so as to be 
rotatable concentrical with the axis of the burner and/or 

displaceable in the axial direction of the burner and whose 
ends (4) facing the burner nozzle (2) are mounted so as to be 

displaceable in the axial direction of the burner and 
pivotable. 
A swirl adjusting device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said mounting of the free ends of the flexible 

tubes (3) is provided by slots (12), or long holes, extending 
in the longitudinal direction thereof and cooperating with 

bolts (13) that are substantial radial relative to the burner 
axis (9). 
A swirl adjusting device according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the ends of the flexible tubes facing 

away from the burner nozzle (2) are fixed in an annular disc-shaped 
carrier (5), which is connected with an actuating means 

for rotating said carrier (5) and/or displacing said carrier 
(5) in the direction of the burner axis. 
A swirl adjusting device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the flexible tubes (3) open into a 

region of the primary air channel (1) having circular cross 
section and that the primary air channel (1) tapers to an 

annular nozzle (2) following said opening of the flexible 
tubes.
