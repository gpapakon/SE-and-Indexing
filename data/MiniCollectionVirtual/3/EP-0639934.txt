<ABSTRACT>
A resistance heating element consists of a fibre-reinforced thermoplastic material having 1-60% by weight of glass fibres and 1-20, preferably 5-15% by weight of steel fibres. The heating element may be produced from thermoplastic pellets which are filled with glass fibres and steel fibres and were obtained by melt pultrusion from continuous strands and cutting to pellet length.

<CLAIMS>
A resistance heating element of thermoplastic materials
having good mechanical and thermal properties,

wherein the resistance heating element comprises
a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic material

having 1-60% by weight of glass fibers and 1-20,
preferably 5-15% by weight of steel fibers.
A resistance heating element as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the thermoplastic granules filled with

glass fibers and steel fibers comprise continuous
fiber strands which have been impregnated with

thermoplastics by melt pultrusion and are
subsequently cut to fiber length/granule length.
A resistance heating element as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the length of the glass fibers and of the

steel fibers is 5-15 mm.
A resistance heating element as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the glass fiber granules comprise short

glass fibers which are prepared by compounding cut
glass into the melt of plastic.
