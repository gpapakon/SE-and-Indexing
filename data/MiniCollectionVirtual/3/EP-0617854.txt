<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sealed cable penetration comprising an outer layer of a heat resistant material which expands upon heating and an inner layer of a flexible, compressible, heat resistant material and that the cable is intended to be inserted in the inner layer. The invention further relates to a method for pulling new cables through the sealed cable penetration, where the inner layer of flexible, heat resistant material is removed, while the outer layer of heat expanding material is maintained, whereafter one or more new cables are pulled and the annulus between the new cables and the outer layer is filled with the flexible, heat resistant material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sealed cable penetrations and a method for pulling 
electrical cables through such sealed cable penetrations. Sealed cable penetrations, such as for example cable penetrations in fire resistant 
walls and bulk-heads are often complicated and have an unpractical design. Further 
most known sealed cable penetrations are costly and difficult to install. Due to the 
lack of good, simple and low cost cable penetration systems, it is often, when new 
cables are pulled through existing cable penetrations, not made a sufficient sealing 
about the new cable. The cable penetration thus no longer satisfy the requirement 
which are set to the fire resistency of such penetrations. As far as it is known, it does 
not exist a certified cable penetration system which has been tested both before and 
after cables have been pulled through the penetration.  
 US-A-4,419,535 discloses a sealed cable penetration 
comprising an outer layer of a heat resistant material which 
surrounds an inner layer and which expands upon heating, the 
inner layer being pressed around a cable and a sealant being 
poured thereon to provide a cold smoke seal. The object underlying the invention is to provide a 
sealed cable penetration having a simple structure and being 
simple to produce and nevertheless provides a bar for cold 
smoke. According to the invention, the above object is 
achieved by a sealed cable penetration comprising an inner 
layer made of a heat resistant, flexible and compressible material 
and an outer layer of a heat resistant material which 
surrounds said inner layer and which expands upon heating, 
characterized in that said inner layer serves as a cold smoke seal, whether 
or not a cable is installed being surrounded by said inner 
layer. Further, according to the invention, a method for installing 
at least one new cable in the above sealed cable penetration 
is provided, wherein said inner layer is removed, 
while said outer layer is maintained, whereafter said new 
cable is pulled and the annulus between the new cable and said 
outer layer is filled with a heat resistant, flexible and compressible 
material for forming a new inner layer. By this method, new cables can be pulled without 
reducing the fire resistance of already installed cable penetrations 
and in a very simple way.  
 As an outer layer it is preferably used an intumescent, vermiculite-based material. It is 
especially preferred to use vermiculite-based sheet material, for example a material as 
described in US
