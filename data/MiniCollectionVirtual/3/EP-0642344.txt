<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stable dry powder formulation of a 
hydrated cephalosporin, e.g., ceftibuten di-or trihydrate, which is suitable 
for use as a pharmaceutical composition in the form of an oral suspension 
product to treat bacterial infections.. USP 4,634,697 discloses ceftibuten, (+)-(6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-4-carboxycrotonamido]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]-oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, a cephalosporin 
antimicrobial agent which exhibits antibacterial activity against a wide 
range of gram-negative and certain gram-positive bacteria. US Patents 4,933,443, 4,812,561 and GB-A-2 192 183 disclose that 
ceftibuten is stable in a (di-or-tri-)hydrate crystalline form and that a 
pharmaceutically effective amount of the (di or tri)hydrate can be 
incorporated into specially sealed hard gelatin capsules for oral 
administration. There is still a need for a stable dry powder ceftibuten 
formulation suitable for suspension in water for oral administration. There 
is also a need for a simple efficient process for making such a stable dry 
powder ceftibuten formulation having an extended shelf life at 
temperatures of 25Â°C or less.  
 In accordance with the present invention there is provided a 
method of preparing a dry hydrated cephalosporin powder formulation 
which is resistant to air oxidation and dehydration is suitable for 
suspension in water to form a orally administerable product which 
comprises admixing at ambient temperature and humidity conditions a 
hydrated cephalosporin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in 
the form of a dry solid powder with substantially dry pharmaceutically 
acceptable excipients selected from the group consisting of nonionic 
surfactants, suspending agents, thickening agents, opacificers, 
preservatives, and sweeteners to form a dry admixture, transferring the 
so-formed dry admixture to a sealable storage container opaque to 
incident visible radiation under an atmosphere containing no more than 
5 volume percent oxygen. The present invention also provides a dry hydrated 
ceftibuten powder formulation suitable for constitution with a 
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition 
in a stable suspension oral dosage form comprising: 
(1) an antibacterially effective amount of hydrated 
ceftibuten containing 7 to 14 weight percent 
water; (2) an effective amount of a nonionic surfactant; (3) an effective amount of an antifoaming agent; (4) an amount of thickening agents effective for thickening 
the suspension
