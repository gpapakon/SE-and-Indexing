<ABSTRACT>
According to a process for applying multiple layers of lacquer on a substrate, a base lacquer layer made of an aqueous coating agent is applied on the possibly precoated substrate, then by covering the base layer is covered with a clear lacquer which contains: (A) at least a hydroxyl group-containing copolymer produced by reacting (a) one or several esters of  alpha -branched aliphatic saturated monocarboxylic acids having one or several epoxide groups or ethylene double bonds in the alcohol part, with (b) one or several alkyl esters of  alpha , beta -ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, (d), if required, one or several  alpha , beta -ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and (e), if required, one or several vinyl monomers different from (a), (b), (c) and (d); (B) one or several polyisocyanates with in average at least 1.5 NCO groups in the molecule in such an amount that the equivalent ratio between the OH groups of component (A) and the NCO groups of component (B) lies between 1:1.6 and 1:2.2.
