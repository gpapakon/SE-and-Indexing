A vacuum cleaner (1) including an electric motor (2a) driving a
fan (2b) for creating internal suction and a sucked-up flow of air

(20) so as to convey sucked-up dust to a dust collector (4), as well
as control and/or regulation means for controlling and/or regulating

the speed of the electric motor, which means are connected to an
internal pressure measuring member (U3) for measuring an internal

pressure, and at least one differential pressure measuring member
(U2) for measuring a differential pressure of the flow of air, said

control means being suitable for continuously controlling and/or
regulating the speed of the electric motor to maintain the suction

and the flow rate of the flow of air within limit values, as a
function of the results of the suction measurements and of the

differential pressure measurements, said vacuum cleaner being
characterized in that the differential pressure measuring member (U2)

comprises at least two measurement points (7a and 7b) mounted in the
flow of air on either side of a part (10) provided with a calibrated

aperture (12) for creating headloss.
A vacuum cleaner according to claim 1, characterized in that the
part (10) is annular in shape so that it obstructs in part the flow

of air.
A vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the part (10) is disposed in a measurement chamber (6) provided

between the dust collector (4) and the fan (2b), the sucked-up flow
of air flowing from the dust collector (4) to the fan (2b).
A vacuum cleaner according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that the suction measuring member for measuring the suction

produced by the fan is disposed in the dust collector (4) in the
vicinity of an inlet orifice (5b) for the flow of air (20).
A vacuum cleaner according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that the suction measuring member (U3) and the differential

pressure measuring member (U2) are constituted by diaphragm pressure-sensitive
switch assemblies. 
A vacuum cleaner according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that the control and/or regulation means comprise electrical

contacts connected to an electrical or electronic circuit making it
possible to vary the power supply voltage fed to the electric motor.
A vacuum cleaner according to claim 6, characterized in that the
electrical contacts are actuated by the pressure-sensitive switch

assemblies (U2 and U3), said contacts being connected in parallel in
the electrical or electronic circuit for powering the electric motor.
A vacuum cleaner according to any one of claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that the pressure-sensitive switch assemblies (U3

and U2) are rated at values lying respectively in the range 130
millibars to 150 millibars, and in the range 8 millibars to 15

millibars for a given calibration of the aperture in the annular part
(10), said pressure-sensitive switch assemblies serving to interrupt

or at least reduce the power supply to the electric motor whenever
the suction or the differential pressure exceeds the corresponding

rated value.
A vacuum cleaner according to claim 8, characterized in that the
annular part (10) is provided with a calibrated aperture (12) that is

circular, that is of diameter lying in the range 35 millimeters to 45
millimeters, and preferably in the range 39 millimeters to 41

millimeters.
A vacuum cleaner according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that, in association with the suction measuring

member (U3) and the differential pressure measuring member (U2), it
includes a second differential pressure measuring member (U1) for

determining the filling level of the dust collector (4).
A vacuum cleaner according to claim 10, characterized in that the
second differential pressure measuring member (U1) is constituted by

a diaphragm pressure-sensitive switch assembly rated at a value lying
in the range 50 millibars to 70 millibars, and connected via its 

inlets to measurement points (7 and 7a) situated in the dust
collector (4).
