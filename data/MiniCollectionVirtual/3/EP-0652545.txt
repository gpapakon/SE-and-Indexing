<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for 
changing the display message of a traffic 

sign, in which procedure display elements 
(2) forming two or more display surfaces 

are used and in which the display message 
of the display elements can be changed by 

means of a display mechanism. The solution 
of the invention uses a message 

changing mechanism (16, 21-24, 26) which 
moves the display element (2) into the 

traffic sign, changes the display position 
of the display element (2) inside 

the traffic sign and returns the display 
element (2) back into contact with the 

front plate (1) of the traffic sign, a 
different message being now displayed by 

the element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure as defined in 
the preamble of claim 1 and to an apparatus as defined in 
the preamble of claim 3 for changing the display message of 
a traffic sign. Previously known are solutions for changeable traffic signs 
based on the use of prisms. In these procedures, the prisms 
are permanently pivoted in the front part of the traffic 
sign frame in such a way that the display faces of the 
prisms are in the same plane with the front side of the 
traffic sign. When the prisms are turned into a new position, 
their corners protrude from the plane of the front 
side of the traffic sign. In winter time, the prisms tend to 
freeze up with the front side of the traffic sign so that 
they cannot be turned. To avoid this problem, the traffic 
sign is provided with a transparent sheet forming a solid 
covering on the front surface of the sign and protecting it 
from water and snow. The sheets are liable to frost, and to 
prevent frosting the traffic sign is provided with a heating 
resistor. However, mere batteries no longer suffice as a 
power source for rotating the prisms and heating the resistor, 
but it is necessary to use mains power. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the 
drawbacks referred to above and to achieve a reliable, 
durable and easy-to-use procedure and apparatus for changing 
the display message of a traffic sign. The procedure of the 
invention is characterized by what is presented in the characterization 
part of claim 1. The apparatus of the invention 
is characterized by what is presented in the characterization 
part of claim 3, and other embodiments of the invention 
are characterized by the features presented in the other 
claims.  The solution of the invention has the advantage that it 
works without a protective sheet in winter conditions as the 
prisms can be retracted to release them if frozen up with 
the front plate. If necessary, a protective sheet can also 
be used, and since the prisms do not protrude during rotation 
to the front side of the plane of the front plate, the 
protective sheet can be attached directly to the surface of 
the traffic sign. By leaving a small air gap between the 
protective sheet and the sign, the formation of frost on the 
sheet is prevented, and if a pressure is applied to the 
sheet from the front side, it will be backed up by the surface 
of the traffic sign and is therefore not easily broken. 
Since the traffic sign either needs no protective sheet at 
all or its construction prevents the

Procedure for changing the display message of a traffic 
sign, in which procedure a display element (2) forming two 

or more display surfaces is used, the display message of 
which display element can be changed by means of a display 

mechanism, characterized in that the procedure comprises at 
least the following steps: 


activating the mechanism for changing the display message, 
moving the display elements (2) into the traffic sign, 
turning the display elements (2) into another display 
position, 
moving the display elements (2) back to the front surface 
of the traffic sign 
deactivating the message changing mechanism. 
Procedure according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
procedure comprieses at least the following steps: 


giving the traffic sign a control signal for changing the 
display message, 
activating the mechanism for changing the display message, 
moving the display elements (2) along their shift slots 
(12) into the traffic sign, 
turning the display elements (2) into another display 
position, 
moving the display elements (2) back along their shift 
slots (12) until they are substantially in contact the 

front plate of the traffic sign, 
deactivating the message changing mechanism. 
Apparatus for changing the display message of a traffic 
sign, said apparatus being provided with at least one display 

element (2) forming two or more display surfaces, the 
display message of which display element can be changed by 

means of a display mechanism, characterized in that the 
apparatus comprises at least 


a mechanism (16, 21-24, 26) set to move the display 
element (2) into the traffic sign, 
a mechanism set to change the display position of the 
display element (2), 
mechanism set to return the display element (2) back 
substantially into contact with the front plate (1) of the 

traffic sign. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
mechanism (16, 21-24, 26) is designed to act as a message 

changing mechanism which is set to move the display element 
(2) into the traffic sign, to change the display position of 

the display element (2) inside the traffic sign and to return 
the display element (2) back substantially into contact 

with the front plate (1) of the traffic sign, now displaying 
a different message.
