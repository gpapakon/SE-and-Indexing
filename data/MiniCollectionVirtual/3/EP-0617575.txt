<ABSTRACT>
There is described an apparatus for cultivating plants in which plants are supported by an array of parallel elements (16) arranged about an elongate radiation source (17), the array of elements being rotatable about the axis of the source. The cylinders may also rotate about their own axes. Plants are applied to the cylinders by housing them in flexible bands, and winding the bands helically round the cylinders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the propagation and growing of 
plants, and particularly concerns methods and apparatus for growing large 
numbers of plants in a small area, with optimized use of available and 
artificial light, and to reduce the effect of plants competing for light. In conventional glasshouse methods, cuttings are rooted in a 
substrate by holding them in a horizontal plane beneath artificial and/or 
natural light. As well as requiring a relatively large ground area for 
each plant, the use of overhead light sources leads to an uneven intensity 
in the light levels received by individual plants in the crop, and thus 
growth rates are non-uniform. Working or harvesting the crop from ground 
level is also labour-intensive and slow due to the inconvenient working 
attitude. In US Patent 3 529 379, there is described an apparatus wherein 
potted plants are placed on trays which are linked to a conveyor system, 
the plants being maintained in a vertical orientation and passing 
vertically by a plurality of light sources arranged in a vertical planar 
array. The plants passing the light sources receive the majority of their 
incident radiation from the side, rather than in a vertically downward 
direction relative to the plants. In US Patent 3 882 634, an apparatus intended to increase plant 
yield by effectively removing gravitational influences on such growth is 
described. The apparatus comprises a plurality of plant supports wherein 
plants are held, the plant supports and plants being rotated about 
horizontal axes which are substantially perpendicular to the plant stems. It is an objective of the present invention to provide an 
apparatus and system for the cultivation of plants wherein a large number 
of plants can be grown in a small area, with substantially uniform 
illumination of all the plants in the crop, and with facilitated ergonomic 
access to the plants for working the crop. According to the present invention, an apparatus for the 
cultivation of plants comprises a pair of substantially rigid rotatable 
end frames mounted for rotation about a common horizontal axis, a number 
of elongate plant-supporting elements mounted at their respective ends to  
 
the respective end frames and arranged with their longitudinal axes 
generally parallel, the plant-supporting elements being rotatable about 
their longitudinal axes relative to the end frames, and wherein the 
plant-supporting elements are provided with radially extending plant 
receptacles arranged regularly on their

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the cultivation of plants comprising a pair of 
substantially rigid rotatable end frames (11) mounted for rotation about a 

common horizontal axis, a number of elongate plant-supporting elements 
(16) mounted at their respective ends to the respective end frames (11) 

and arranged with their longitudinal axes generally parallel, the 
plant-supporting elements being rotatable about their longitudinal axes 

relative to the end frames, and wherein the plant-supporting elements are 
provided with radially extending plant receptacles (20) arranged regularly 

on their surfaces, characterised in that an elongate horizontal linear 
source (17) of radiation beneficial to plants, emitting radiation 

substantially uniformly in all radial directions, is positioned along the 
axis of rotation of the end frames (11) to expose the surfaces of the 

plant-supporting elements (16) to a uniform amount of incident radiation 
from all directions relative to the plant stem direction. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the plant supporting 
elements (16) have attached to their surfaces a mat comprising a radially 

outer retaining layer, and a growing medium layer, and plants are 
dispersed in the growing medium layer. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the plant 
supporting elements (16) are conical, and have their generatrix adjacent 

the radiation source aligned parallel thereto. 
An apparatus according to any preceding Claim, wherein the 
distance of each plant-supporting element from the radiation source is 

adjustable. 
An apparatus according to any preceding Claim, wherein the 
plant-supporting elements (16) are hollow cylinders and individual plants 

are receivable in openings (20) in the cylinder wall so that nutrients 
supplied to the interior of the cylinders are accessible to the plant 

roots. 
An apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein the plant-supporting 
elements (16) are formed by an outer impermeable skin and an inner foam 

core surrounding a central void, the foam core being permeable to liquids, 
and a plurality of openings being formed in the skin in alignment with 

radial passages in the foam core.  
 
An apparatus according to Claim 6, wherein the foam core 
comprises areas of differing permeability and rigidity, and wherein the 

radial passages are formed in areas of relatively low permeability and 
high rigidity. 
An apparatus according to Claim 6 or Claim 7, wherein the foam 
core includes a radially extending helical stratum of foam material of low 

permeability. 
An apparatus according to any preceding Claim, wherein each 
plant-supporting element (16) is independently driven in rotation relative 

to the end frames.
