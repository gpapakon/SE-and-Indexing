Cold self-adhesive bituminous composition, characterised in
that it comprises a mixture composed of:


5% to 25% of a mixture of styrene-diene type rubber
polymers comprising at least:


(A) a radial block styrene-butadiene copolymer;
(B) a linear and/or radial block styrene-isoprene
copolymer;

characterised in that B represents between 5% and 50% by
weight of the polymer mixture;


(C) a di-block styrene-butadiene copolymer;
0% to 25% of one or more sticky resins;
5% to 95% of bitumen.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised in that a
radial block styrene-butadiene copolymer having a styrene

content of approximately 15% to 45% by weight, preferably
between 25% and 35% by weight, and a molecular weight in

the range of between 100 000 and 600 000, and preferably
between 250 000 and 350 000, is used as copolymer (A).
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 2,
characterised in that copolymer (A) represents between 10%

and 45% by weight of the polymer mixture, and preferably
between 15% and 35% by weight of the polymer mixture.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised in that a
linear and/or radial block styrene-isoprene copolymer, the

styrene content of which represents from 10% to 40% by
weight, and preferably between 10% and 20%, and the total

molecular weight of which is in the range of between 
60 000 and 400 000, and preferably between 100 000 and 150

000, is used as copolymer (B).
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that copolymer (B) preferably represents
between 5% and 25% by weight of the polymer mixture.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised in that a
di-block styrene-diene, preferably styrene-butadiene,

copolymer, the styrene content of which represents from 15%
to 45% by weight, preferably from 20% to 35% by weight, and

the total molecular weight of which is in the range of
between 50 000 and 150 000, preferably between 50 000 and

100 000, is used as copolymer (C).
Composition according to Claim 6, characterised in that
copolymer (C) is a statistical chain, i.e. it contains a

styrene block and a styrene-butadiene block on the basis of
statistical distribution.
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that copolymer (C) represents from 10% to
75% by weight of the polymer mixture, and preferably from

30% to 60% by weight.
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that the mixture of rubber polymers also
contains a linear block styrene-butadiene copolymer.
Sealing panels comprising at least one layer of a
bituminous composition according to any one of Claims 1 to

9.
