<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the purification, and cloning of the cellular receptor molecules for
luteinizing hormone and choriogonado-tropin.
The invention further relates to the uses for the purified hormone receptor molecules.The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) is the source of several major glycoprotein
hormones including luteinizing hormone (lutropin, or "LH"), choriogonadotropin (or "CG"), follicle
stimulating hormone (follitropin or "FSH"), and thyroid stimulating hormone (thyrotropin or
"TSH"). The hormones of the anterior pituitary are reviewed by Norman, A.W. et al.(ln:
Hormones, Acad. Press, N.Y., (1987)). The hormones are highly conserved evolutionarily; the
primary amino acid sequences of the LH, CG, and TSH hormones of rat and other animals are
highly similar to those of humans (Strickland, T.W. et al., In: Luteinizing Hormone Action and
Receptors, Ascoli, M. (Ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL (1985)).Luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and
thyroid stimulating hormone share many common characteristics, and have been considered to be
members of a family of glycoprotein hormones. All contain approximately 200-250 amino acid
residues, and are composed of a common α subunit (having a molecular weight of approximately
13-15 kDa) and a distinctive β subunit (having a molecular weight of approximately 13-22 kDa).
The α subunits of LH, FSH, and TSH are identical; the α subunit of CG has been reported to
differ slightly from the others (Ganong, W.F. Review of Medical Physiology, 9th Ed., Lange
Medical Pub., Los Altos, CA, (1979)).The hormones mediate their biological actions by binding to receptor molecules present on
the surfaces of target cells. Interaction of the α subunit with the hormone specific β subunits of
the hormones are responsible for confering the binding specificity of the hormones. The hormones
act by activating cellular adenylate cyclase to increase intracellular cAMP levels (de la Uose-Hermier
et al., Acta Endocrinol.118:399-406 (1988)).Luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone are both gonadotropins (Ascoli, M.
(Ed.) Luteinizing Hormone Action and Receptors, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, (1985)). LH binds
to a receptor expressed on the surfaces of Leydig (interstitial) cells (Ascoli, M., In: TheReceptors, (Conn, P.M. (Ed.), vol. 2, pp 368 (1985)). In men, LH binding causes the Leydig cells to
increase their synthesis of testosterone. In women, such binding causes the granulosa, theca,
interstitial, and luteal cells to increase
