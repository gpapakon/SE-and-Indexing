<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning apparatus for removing residual developer material remaining on a 
surface of a printing machine (Fig 3) is provided. The cleaning apparatus includes a movable 

cleaning brush (104) naving bristles. The brush (104) is positioned adjacent to the surface so 
that as the movable brush (104) is moved, the bristles contact the surface and the residual 

developer material is removed therefrom. A detoning device (200) is positioned adjacent to 
the movable cleaning brush (104) in a manner that permits the bristles to contact the detoning 

device (200) as the movable cleaning brush (104) is moved. The detoning device (200) includes 
a plurality of hook-like and/or teeth-like members (204: Fig. 7) which dislodge the residual 

developer material from the bristles as they contact the hook-like members.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a cleaning apparatus for removing residual developer material remaining on a surface of a photoreceptor of for printing 
machine, and, more specifically, to a detoning apparatus which facilitates removal of adherent 
developer material and developer material additives from the bristles of a cleaning brush. In electrophotographic applications such as xerography, although a preponderance 
of the toner forming the image is transferred to the paper during a transfer operation, some 
toner invariably remains on the charge retentive surface, it being held thereto by relatively 
hign electrostatic and/or mechanical forces. A commercially successful mode of cleaning 
employed in automatic xerography utilizes a brush with soft fiber bristles to remove residual 
toner particles from the charge retentive surface. US-A-3,842,273 discloses an apparatus for cleaning a corona generator. The corona 
generator includes a shield, a portion of which is preferably cleaned with a movable brush. In 
one example the brush is constructed with hook-like members. US-A-5,153,642 is directed toward a fiber cleaning system for a development system. 
The fiber cleaning system, which includes a plurality of hook-like members mounted on a 
support, is installed removably in a development station. In operation, developer material 
flows through the hook-like members so that contaminants are trapped thereby. Even for those circumstances in which toner is effectively removed from the 
photoreceptor with one or more cleaning brushes, the brushes can become "choked" as a 
result of the excessive amount of toner being delivered thereto. In an attempt to avoid 
choking, toner is typically removed from the bristles of each brush by way of "detoning". 
Established practices to detone fiber brushes include, but are not limited to: (a) overcoming 
electrostatic adhesion forces with a suitable air pressure differential, (b) knocking toner from 
fibers with a mechanical stop or a "flicker bar", (c) using biased detoning rolls to counter or 
oppose electrostatic forces greater than the adhesion forces and d) increasing brush speed so 
that the radial centrifugal force for toner detachment overcomes electrostatic adhesion force. 
Two other approaches to detoning are disclosed in the following references: US-A-4,172,303 and US-A-4,213,794 disclose a cleaning system with a cleaning brush 
that is adapted to remove toner from a photoconductive member as the brush is rotated about 
its central axis. The

<CLAIMS>
A cleaning apparatus for removing residual developer material remaining on a 
surface of a photoreceptor member (10) of a printing machine, comprising: 


a movable cleaning brush (104) having bristles extending therefrom and being positioned 
adjacent said surface so that, when said movable cleaning brush is moved, said bristles are brought 

into contact with the surface for removing the residual developer material therefrom; and 
a detoning device (214 ; 222) being positioned adjacent to said movable cleaning brush (104) in 
a manner that permits said bristles to contact said detoning device as said movable cleaning brush 

is moved, 
 
   characterised by said detoning device (214) including a plurality of hook-like members 

(216) which dislodge the residual developer material from said bristles as they contact said hook-like 
members. 
The cleaning apparatus of claim 1, wherein said detoning device (214) further 
comprises a substrate (218), said hook-like members (216) being mounted on said substrate, and 

wherein said hook-like members 

(A) are substantially shorter than said bristles, 
(B) are 
arranged in rows with each bristle moving through a substantial portion of the rows, 
(C) comprise 
conductive hook-like members adapted to be electrically biased with an electrical signal to assist in 

removing the residual developer material from said movable cleaning member, and/or 
(D) comprise 
hook-like members adapted to be tribo-electrically charged for removing the residual developer 

material from said movable cleaning brush. 
The cleaning apparatus of claim 1 or 2, wherein said detoning device (214) is 
mounted to a portion of the printing machine so that said detoning device is stationary relative to 

said rotatable cleaning brush (104), the detoning device preferably being releasably mounted to the 
printing machine portion. 
The cleaning apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the detoning device (214) 
includes a detoning member which is separate from said plurality of hook-like members (216), said 

detoning member supplementing the removal of residual developer material from said movable 
cleaning brush. 
The cleaning apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 4, further comprising a vacuum source 
(202), positioned adjacent to said hook-like members (216), for removing the residual developer 

material therefrom.  
 
The apparatus of claim 1 or 2, or claim 4 or 5 when dependent thereon, wherein 

said movable cleaning brush (104) is rotatable; and 
said detoning device (214) is rotatable so that it can be rotated relative to said rotatable 
cleaning brush.
