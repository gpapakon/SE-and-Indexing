<DESCRIPTION>
 Zeolite Catalyst and Catalysed ReactionsThis invention relates to catalysts, more especially to a method of modifying catalysts, the modified catalysts themselves, and to an oxidation process using the catalysts produced by the method.Zeolite catalysts of many types have been proposed for use in numerous chemical processes. Among such catalysts are catalysts based on silicon and titanium oxides and optionally other components.U.S. Patent No. 3329481 describes a catalyst of the formula(°2/n °)w xo2 (si02)y where D is a monovalent or divalent metal, hydrogen or ammonium, n being the valency of D, w represents 0.5 to4, X represents one or more of titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and y represents from 1 to 15, preferably from 2 to 10.U.S. Patent No. 3702886 describes crystalline zeolites denoted ZSM-5, their manufacture, and their use as catalysts in a number of hydrocarbon conversions.U.S. Patent No. 4061724 describes silicalite, processes for its manufacture, and its x-ray diffraction pattern.GB-A-2071071 describes porous crystalline synthetic materials of the formula x Ti02. (l-x)Si02, in which x is from 0.0005 to 0.04, and preferably from 

 -0.01 to 0.025, which have a silicalite structure in which titanium is substituted for silicon.In British Patent Application No. 2024790, silicalites modified by the inclusion in the structure of other oxides, inter alia titanium, are described, as are uses for the modified material as catalysts.GB-A-2083816 and 2116974 describe similar materials and their uses as oxidation catalysts.EP-A-226258 describes silicates containing titanium and iron, and their uses as catalysts in various organic reactions.In EP-A-100119, there is described a process for epoxidation of olefinic compounds by H2O2 using as catalyst a titanium-containing zeolite of the formula given in GB-A-2071071. The X-ray diffraction pattern and infra-red spectrum of the zeolite are described, and the material is designated TS-1. In EP-A-230949, the proportion of undesired by-products in the epoxidation reaction is reduced by employing a TS-1 catalyst treated with a base.In WO 90/05126 there is described the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbon chains using a titanium-containing silicalite catalyst with an infra-red absorption band at about 950cm-1.In EP-A-412596 there is described the oxidation of paraffins in the presence of a titanium silicalite.A paper by M. Na amura et a_l, Shokubai (Catalyst) ,
