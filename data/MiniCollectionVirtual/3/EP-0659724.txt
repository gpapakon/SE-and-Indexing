<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for removing organic acids and 
derivatives thereof from a crude alkyl tertiary alkyl ether 

stream such as may be found in the feed to, or effluent from, 
a reactor for a process for producing ethers. The removal 

method comprises: 

contacting a crude ether stream in a treating zone over 
one or more beds of a solid base for a period of time 

sufficient to neutralise said organic acids and derivatives 
thereof, and 
removing a substantially organic acid-free crude ether 
product from the treating zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the neutralisation of crude 
alkyl tertiary alkyl ether streams, particularly crude methyl 
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) streams such as the feed to, or 
effluent from, a one-step process for producing methyl 
tertiary butyl ether. More particularly, the invention 
relates to the neutralisation of crude alkyl tertiary alkyl 
ether streams using a series of different classes of solid 
bases. Most especially, the method of the present invention 
finds particular utility in neutralizing organic acids and 
esters in crude MTBE streams, such as formic acid and 
hydrolysable formic esters, particularly methyl formate and 
butyl formate. It is well-known that acids are formed during the 
oxidation of hydrocarbons such as isobutane, by the 
decomposition of peroxides such as t-butylhydroperoxide in 
crude tertiary butyl alcohol (tBA) feed, and from the 
hydrolysis of formates present in the tBA feed, resulting in 
the presence of acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, and 
isobutyric acid in the feed to a one-step process for making 
MTBE. In MTBE pilot plants where carbon steel is sometimes 
used in the one-step reactor and distillation towers, such 
acids have been shown to cause significant corrosion if left 
untreated. One solution to this problem is injection of sodium 
hydroxide into the effluent stream of the MTBE one-step 
reactor in order to neutralise said acids. However, this 
solution may lead to unacceptable corrosion rates at certain 
points in the process. In addition, the injection of sodium 
hydroxide causes other concerns such as potential foaming in 
downstream distillation columns, formation of a second liquid 
phase with the additional water introduced, and the necessity 
to control pH, which is notoriously difficult.  U.S. Patent No. 5,106,458 discloses a process for 
removing methyl formate from impure propylene oxide which 
comprises contacting said impure propylene oxide in a treating 
zone with a strongly basic ion exchange resin for a period of 
time sufficient to convert said methyl formate to formic acid 
and methanol. The preferred basic ion exchange resin is a 
styrene divinylbenzene copolymer containing quaternary 
ammonium groups. The accepted method of attempting to remove formic acid 
and other organic acids from the effluent of a one-step 
process for producing MTBE is the previously mentioned 
injection of sodium hydroxide into the stream. However, it 
is apparent that this method can cause problems downstream, 
as well as other disadvantages. It
