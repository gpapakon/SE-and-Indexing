<ABSTRACT>
A lens system (10) containing an aspherical portion (18) enabling minimization of spherical aberration as well as the lens length (1). The lens system (10) includes a conical lens (12) portion providing total internal reflection of light within the lens system and an integrally attached aspherical lens portion (18). For light rays within a defined angular range of less than about +-24 , the light rays are focused on the exit aperture (for a concentrator) at a minimum lens length, (l).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Illumination System Having an Aspherical LensThe invention is generally concerned with an illumination system using an aspherical lens in at least part of the system. More particularly, the invention is concerned with a lens system having an aspherical containing lens portion integrally coupled to a conical lens portion to provide a lens system of minimum overall length and substantially diminished aberration effects.A number of optical applications require the use of a lens system employing a light source at a finite distance from the lens system for producing a desired illumination output or a target at a finite distance from the lens to collect light (reverse problem). Frequently, such systems utilize spherical lens components which lead to spherical aberration; and the lens system itself can have a relatively large operating length making practical applications difficult to implement, or even impossible to carry out under conditions allowing only limited operational space.Objects of the InventionIt is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved illumination system and method of designing an illumination system.It is another object of the invention to provide a novel lens system having minimum length while producing the desired optical illumination or concentration with minimal aberration effects.It is a further object of the invention to provide an improved lens system having an aspherical lens portion and a conical lens portion of minimum length while producing a desired optical illumination.It is yet an additional object of the invention to provide an improved illumination system having an aspherical lens portion causing incident light rays to by imaged on the exit aperture using a minimum conical lens portion length.It is still another object of the invention to provide a novel aspherically based lens system having minimized spherical aberration.It is yet a further object of the invention to provide an improved illumination system and method of manipulating light such that light rays 

within a controlled angular range are controllably deflected to pass through the exit aperture at a minimum overall lens length.It is still another object of the invention to provide a novel light concentrator lens system having a minimum conical lens portion length and minimized aberration effects.Other objects and advantages of the lens system, together with the manner of operation thereof will become apparent from the following detailed description and drawings described below, wherein like
