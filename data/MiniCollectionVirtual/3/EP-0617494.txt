<ABSTRACT>
Electric distribution box for mains distribution point and informatics 
transmission, having a parallelepipedic shape whose front part is the lid which is 

secured through conventional bolts and nuts and with the possibility of rotating 
by means of hinges arranged in one of the side walls. The lid has five windows. 

Two of them are rectangular, one for positioning the automatic module and the 
other one slightly larger for installing three cylindrical female tap connectors 

with ground connection. A small neon pilot situated at one corner of said latter 
window is used as a system for visualizing the connection of the assembly to the 

electric mains, through the automatic means. These two disclosed elements, the 
automatic means and the female mains connectors, are secured together inside 

the box through conventional bolts and nuts. The other three windows have the 
same dimensions and are used for the mounting, fixed to the lid, of three informatics transmission connectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention, as indicated in its title, relates 
to an electric and informatics distribution box, having a 
rectangular parallelepipedic shape with a lid on the front 
side thereof fixed with screws and having the possibility 
of rotating on a larger side wall by means of hinges. The 
lid has five cavities , such as windows, two of which 
being elongated rectangulars, the first of them near a 
smaller side wall which is used for the installation of an 
automatic module, and the other near a larger side wall 
where three female tap connectors, being circular and 
having ground connections, are placed. The other three 
cavities of the lid are square-shaped, being symmetrically 
distributed on the remaining larger side wall; there are 
three standard connectors located inside the box for 
informatics applications, of distribution and transmission 
of data, said three connectors being joined and fixed to 
the lid, and the rest of the connectors are installed 
fixed on the general body of the distribution box. As indicated hereinabove, the box has a 
rectangular parallelepipedic right angle shape, its front 
side being the lid where the connectors and the automatic 
means are placed, siad lid being of elongated rectangular 
shape. The bottom has smaller dimension with respect to 
the general body of the lid, the latter being fixed by 
means of various screws distributed symmetrically on the 
larger side walls. The reception of these screws inside 
the box is carried out by small tubular cylinders, joined 
tangentially to the body of the box. There exists the 
possibility that the a longer side of the lid is joined to 
the rest of the box by means of hinges situated on the 
corners of said side, in order to be able to provide the  
 
turning of the lid and carry out in such a manner the 
installation and maintenance operations. The object of the present invention will be 
better understood with the aid of the following 
description carried out on the basis of a practical 
example of embodiment. Said description is done by the aid 
of the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 shows a general view in perspective 
of the electric distribution box. Figure 2 shows a perspective view of the 
inside of the electric distribution box, with the lid 
open. The lid (2) has five windows (3), two of 
which being rectangular and one near the smaller side 
where the automatic means (5) is installed, this element 
being parallelepipedic and rectangular, almost of the same 
dimensions that the smaller side of the

Electric distribution box for mains 
distribution point and informatics transmission, of the 

type usually used to provide energy supply from the mains 
and electric information signals, mainly informatics, to 

electric apparatuses, characterized in having a general 
shape of right angle parallelepipedic rectangular box, 

having a lid at the front part, fixed by means of screws, 
with five windows distributed on the surface thereof, two 

of which being rectangular, one for the positioning of an 
automatic means, and another where three cylindrical 

female tap connectors are placed alined and with ground 
terminal; a small neon light on a corner of this window 

serves as display of the connection of the whole assembly 
to the mains, through the automatic means, siad described 

elements being fixed inside the box by means of screws. 
The remaining three windows are square-shaped, having the 

same dimensions, and serve for the installation of three 
connectors of informatics transmission fixed to the lid. 

The lid being fixed to the lid by means of screws, having 
the possibility that a longer side of the same is joined 

to the rest of the box by means of hinges, allowing thus 
its joining and turning in order to carry out the 

installation and maintenance operations of the whole 
assembly. 
Electric distribution box for mains 
distribution point and informatics transmission, according 

to the previous claim, characterized in that the switch is 
a bar parallel to the smaller sides , being basculant and 

placed inside a small square-shaped frame. The activation 
of the switch is by means of basculation for which it has 

two ribs perpendicular to the bar at its ends for the 
selection of on or off of the distribution box.
