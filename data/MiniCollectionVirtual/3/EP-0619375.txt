<ABSTRACT>
Genus- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes derived from the 
M. 
paratuberculosis
 70kD heat shock protein gene sequence. The probes are useful for detecting 
Mycobacteria and for identifying specific species of Mycobacteria.

<DESCRIPTION>
The Mycobacteria are a genus of bacteria which are acid-fast, non-motile,
gram-positive
rods. The genus comprises several species which include, but are not limited to,
Mycobacterium africanum, M. avium, M. bovis, M. bovis-BCG, M. chelonae, M. fortuitum,
M. gordonae, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii, M. microti, M. scrofulaceum, M.
paratuberculosis and M. tuberculosis. Certain of these organisms are the causative agents of
disease. For the first time since 1953, cases of mycobacterial infections are increasing in the
United States. Of particular concern is tuberculosis, the etiological agent of which is M.
tuberculosis. Many of these new cases are related to the AIDS epidemic, which provides an
immune compromised population which is particularly susceptible to infection by
Mycobacteria. Other mycobacterial infections are also increasing as a result of the increase in
available immune compromised patients. Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium kansasii and
other non-tuberculosis mycobacteria are found as opportunistic pathogens in HIV infected and
other immune compromised patients.At the present time the diagnosis of mycobacterial infections is dependent on acid-fast
staining and cultivation of the organism, followed by biochemical assays. These procedures
are time-consuming, and a typical diagnosis using conventional culture methods can take as
long as six weeks. Automated culturing systems such as the BACTECâ„¢ system (Becton
Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD) can decrease the time for diagnosis to one to
two weeks. However, there is still a need to reduce the time required for diagnosing
Mycobacterial infections to less than a week, preferably to about one day. Oligonucleotide
probe based assays such as Southern hybridizations or dot blots are capable of returning a
rapid result (i.e., in one day or less) but for diagnosis of Mycobacterial infections such
methods would require an oligonucleotide probe which is specific for the genus of
Mycobacteria or specific for a particular mycobacterial species if specific identification of the
organism is desired. Probes of the required specificity have not previously been available for
the gene encoding the 70K heat shock protein. Heat shock proteins are a family of proteins which are expressed in elevated amounts
when an organism is challenged by an increase in temperature. The heat shock proteins are
highly conserved (R. J. Garcia, et al. (1989) Infection and Immunity 57:204-212;
R. S. Gupta,
et al. (1992) J. Bacteriology 174:4594-4605). One such heat shock
