<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a recording 
apparatus which can determine a position of a carriage (6) 

on which a recording head is mounted with high accuracy 
without enhancing positional accuracy of a carriage (6) 

position detecting system. In this recording apparatus, 
a rod-like member (12) is moved upwardly to be engaged by a 

recessed portion formed in the carriage (6). A deviation 
amount of the carriage (6) generated by such engagement is 

detected by a linear encoder and is used as a correction 
value when the carriage is moved next time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording 
apparatus, and more particularly, it relates to a 
recording apparatus having an encoder for detecting a 
position and a speed of a carriage on which a recording 
head is mounted. In so-called serial recording apparatuses 
wherein recording is effected by moving a carriage on 
which a recording head is mounted along a guide shaft, 
a magnetic linear encoder, an optical linear encoder or 
the like has been used to detect a position and a speed 
of the carriage. In the recording apparatuses having the magnetic 
linear encoder, a magnetic scale portion is arranged in 
the apparatus, and a detection portion comprised of an 
MR element (ferromagnetic reluctance effect element) is 
arranged on the carriage shiftable relative to the 
scale portion. On the other hand, in the recording 
apparatuses having the optical linear encoder, a scale 
portion formed from a slit-shaped film is arranged in the 
apparatus, and a reading portion having a sensor of 
light-permeable type or light-reflection type is attached 
to the carriage shiftable relative to the scale portion.  In such recording apparatuses, in order to 
determine address of the scale of the (magnetic or 
optical) linear encoder, the following method has been 
adopted. That is to say, a photo-interrupter is arranged 
in the apparatus independently from the linear encoder, 
so that all of the address on the entire area of the 
scale can be determined on the basis of a reference 
position of the scale where an optical axis of the 
photo-interrupter is blocked by a portion of the 
carriage And, on the basis of the address of the scale 
determined by this method, a shift position of the 
carriage is determined and the recording is effected by 
the recording head mounted on the carriage at that shift 
position. Further, when the recording head is of ink 
jet type, a sucking operation or a capping operation is 
effected at a predetermined position on the basis of the 
address of the scale as ink discharge recovery treatment 
for the recording head. By the way, in the above-mentioned conventional 
techniques, since the photo-interrupter is arranged in 
the apparatus independently from the linear encoder to 
determine the address of the scale of the linear encoder, 
in order to correctly or accurately determine the 
address of the scale, dimensional accuracy of parts of the 
photo-interrupter itself, attachment accuracy of the 
photo-interrupter to the apparatus and switching accuracy  
 
of signal output when the
