<ABSTRACT>
Process for trichromatic dyeing or printing of natural or synthetic polyamide fibre material, characterised in that there is used a dye mixture of at least two yellow or orange-dyeing dyes of the formula (1) 
<

>
  where R1 is hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy or halogen, and  X is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl, together with at least one red-dyeing dye of the formulae (2) and (3)   
<

 where R2 is C1-C6-alkyl, phenyl or cyclohexyl and R3 is C1-C6-alkyl, or the radicals R2 and R3 form together with the nitrogen atom connecting them an azepinyl ring, and R4 is hydrogen, C2-C4-alkanoylamino or halogen, and together with at least one of the blue-dyeing dyes of the formulae (4) and (5) 
<

A process for dyeing or printing natural or
synthetic polyamide fibre material by the trichromatic

technique, which comprises using a dye mixture of at
least two yellow- or orange-dyeing dyes of formulae



and


together with at least one red-dyeing dye of formulae
(2) and (3)


 
in which R
2
 is C
1
-C
6
alkyl, phenyl or cyclohexyl and R
3
 is
C
1
-C
6
alkyl, or the radicals R
2
 and R
3
, together with the
nitrogen atom linking them, form a perhydroazepinyl

ring of formula


in which R
4
 is hydrogen, halogen or C
2
-C
4
alkanoylamino;
and together with at least one of the blue-dyeing dyes

of formulae (4) and (5)


in which R
5
 is hydrogen or C
1
-C
4
alkyl and R
6
 is
C
1
-C
4
alkyl or amino,


in which R
7
 is hydrogen or methyl and R
8
 is a C
2-4

hydroxyalkylsulfamoyl radical. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein a red-dyeing
dye used is a dye of formula (2) in which R
2
 is
cyclohexyl and R
3
 is methyl, or the radicals R
2
 and R
3
,
together with the nitrogen atom linking them, form a

perhydroazepinyl ring of formula (50).
A process according to claim 1, wherein a blue-dyeing
dye used is a dye of formula (4) or a mixture of

the dye of formula (4) with a dye of formula (5), where
R
5
 is hydrogen, R
6
 is methyl or ethyl and R
8
 is a
radical of formula -SO
2
-NH-CH
2
-CH
2
-OH.
A process according to claim 1, wherein a dye
mixture of yellow- or orange-dyeing dyes that is used

is a mixture comprising the dye of formula


together with a dye of formula


and a red-dyeing dye used is a dye of formula (2) in
which R
2
 is cyclohexyl and R
3
 is methyl,

or the radicals R
2
 and R
3
, together with the nitrogen
atom linking them, form an azepinyl ring of formula

(50), and a blue-dyeing dye used is a dye of formula
(4) or a mixture of the dye of formula (4) with a dye

of formula (5) where R
5
 is hydrogen, R
6
 is methyl or
ethyl and R
8
 is a radical of formula -SO
2
-NH-CH
2
-CH
2
-OH.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein a red-dyeing dye used is a dye of formula (2)

in which R
2
 is cyclohexyl and R
3
 is methyl. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

wherein blue-dyeing dyes used comprise a mixture
comprising the dye of formula (4) together with a dye

of formula (5), where R
5
 is hydrogen, R
6
 is methyl or,
preferably, ethyl, R
7
 is methyl and R
8
 is a radical of
formula -SO
2
-NH-CH
2
-CH
2
-OH.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
which comprises not using an additional yellow- or

orange-dyeing dye besides the dyes of formulae (6) and
(8).
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein wool or synthetic polyamide fibre material is

dyed or printed.
