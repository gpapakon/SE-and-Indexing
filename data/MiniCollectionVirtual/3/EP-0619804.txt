<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain substituted 
phenylamine compounds which are useful as herbicides 
and their agriculturally suitable compositions as well 
as methods for their use as general or selective 
preemergent or postemergent herbicides or as plant 
growth regulants. New compounds effective for controlling the growth 
of undesired vegetation are in constant demand. In the 
most common situation, such compounds are sought to 
selectively control the growth of weeds in useful crops 
such as cotton, rice, corn, wheat and soybeans, to name 
a few. Unchecked weed growth in such crops can cause 
significant losses, reducing profit to the farmer and 
increasing costs to the consumer. In other situations, 
herbicides are desired which will control all plant 
growth. Examples of areas in which complete control of 
all vegetation is desired are areas around railroad 
tracks, storage tanks and industrial storage areas. 
There are many products commercially available for 
these purposes, but the search continues for products 
which are more effective, less costly and 
environmentally safe. J. Org. Chem., 46, 1643-1646 (1981); Acta Chemica 
Scandinavia B, 33, 352-358 (1979); J. Org. Chem., 31, 
3719-3725 (1966), and Chem. Abstr. 95:61644v disclose 
compounds wherein the phenyl groups are unsubstituted. 
There is no mention of herbicidal utility. There is no 
disclosure of compounds of the present invention. EP(A)118,093 discloses certain biphenyl compounds 
wherein the phenyl rings are unsubstituted. Herbicidal 
utility is not disclosed. There is disclosure of 
agricultural utility as a fungicide. There is no 
disclosure of compounds of the present invention.  
 J. Org. Chem. 28, 1759-62 (1963) and J. Amer. Chem. 
Soc., 61, 3487-89 (1939) disclose biphenyl compounds 
which only may have the substituents F or Br 
substituted on one phenyl ring. There is no disclosure 
of compounds of the present invention. The invention comprises a method for controlling 
the growth of undesired vegetation by the preemergent 
and/or postemergent application to the locus to be 
protected of an effective amount of compounds of 
Formula I: 
  
 
wherein 
Qis 
Ris H, C₁-C₂ alkyl, C₁-C₂ haloalkyl, C₁-C₂ alkoxy, 
C₁-C₂ haloalkoxy, C₁-C₂ haloalkylthio, halogen, CN 
or NO₂; Yis NR⁷C(O)XR³; Xis a single bond, O, S or NR⁴; R¹is H, C₁-C₃ alkyl, C₁-C₃ alkoxy, C₁-C₃ haloalkoxy, 
C₁-C₃ alkylthio, C₂-C₃ alkynyl, C₂-C₃ alkoxyalkyl,
