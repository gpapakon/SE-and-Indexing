<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for reinforcing concrete structures. In this arrangement, use is made of prestressed reinforcing elements with essential centrically arranged stressing members in a mortar matrix. These are produced in two stages. First of all, a thin band-like or wire-like endless half-finished product is fabricated. This is then processed by cutting, bending or laminating reinforcing elements, e.g. reinforcing mats, latticed bearing members or the like.

Method for reinforcing a concrete structure by
producing prestressed reinforcing elements with

substantially centrally arranged tendons in a mortar
matrix and by laying them untensioned in surrounding

concrete, comprising the following stages

(A) continuous production of a semi-finished
reinforcing element (12) in strip form or wire form

which can be deformed in the final state, of a
thickness of 3 to 20 mm in at least one direction

transversely to the longitudinal extent of the tendons
(2), in which production


(a) at least one endless tendon (2) is taken from
a supply reel (4),
(b) is passed under tensile stress through a
mortar forming zone and a mortar hardening zone

(6, 22, 40) and
(c) the at least partially hardened semi-finished

product is cut to desired lengths;
(B) further processing of the semi-finished product
(12) from stage A by bending and/or laminating or by

intermeshing or by winding and
(C) introducing the semi-finished product (12) from
stage B into surrounding concrete.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that at least two similar or different groups of

reinforcing elements in strip form are processed into a
grid-shaped, sheet-like, laminated or intermeshed

composite reinforcing element. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that at least one reinforcing element

(150) is wound onto a cylindrical substrate (154).
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that a lattice girder (160) is produced from a

corrugated-laminated composite reinforcing element
(166) as a web with two reinforcing elements as the

upper flange and lower flange (162, 164) by spot-laminating,
the local length of the corrugations being

adapted if need be to the static requirements, and if
need be a plurality of lattice girders being processed

with further reinforcing elements into a physical form.
Method for reinforcing a concrete structure by
producing prestressed reinforcing elements with

substantially centrally arranged tendons, extending in
at least one direction, in a mortar matrix and by

laying them untensioned in surrounding concrete,
comprising the following stages


(A) producing a grid-shaped, sheet-like semi-finished
reinforcing element which can be deformed in the final

state, of a thickness of 3 to 20 mm, in which
production


(a) at least two groups of tendons (2, 114) are
prestressed in a two-dimensional stressing bed

(110),
(b) a mortar matrix is introduced and made to
harden, the grid clearances in the stressing bed

being predetermined or introduced into the not yet
completely hardened mortar matrix,
(c) in an at least partially hardened state, the
tendons are released and
(d) the sheet-like semi-finished product is
removed from the stressing bed;
(B) further processing of the grid-shaped, sheet-like
semi-finished reinforcing element by


(a) if need be, cutting to dimensions to fit,
(b) if need be, shaping by bending and/or
laminating with similar or different reinforcing

elements and 
(c) introducing into surrounding concrete.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the reinforcing elements (130)

are bent over a bending roller (132) of a radius
adapted to match the thickness of the reinforcing

element.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the cracks produced by bending

are filled with synthetic resin.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that untensioned, flexible plastic,

glass, carbon or metal fibres or untensioned, rigid
reinforcing wires or strips of metal are introduced

into the mortar matrix.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that tendons consist of steel, glass,

carbon, aramid or heat-resistant filaments, preferably
of basalt.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the mortar at least partially

contains a polymer as a binder.
Reinforcing mat for a concrete structure, in
particular for skin reinforcement, characterized by a

grid-shaped arrangement of a multiplicity of integrally
formed or cross-laminated or intermeshed, prestressed

reinforcing elements in strip form, produced by the
method according to Claims 1 to 10, each of which

contains substantially centrally arranged tendons in a
mortar matrix.
