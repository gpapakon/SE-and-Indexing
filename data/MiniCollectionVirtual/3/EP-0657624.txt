<ABSTRACT>
Turbomachine wall in which, with the outer casing (1) and the shroud segments (5) delimiting the gas outflow stream (14) and the assembly flanges (4) isolate partitioned volumes (20) occupied, according to the invention, by sealing bodies (25) composed of a flexible envelope (27) containing a wad (stuffing) (26). The sealing body (25) is entirely flexible, it deforms under the action of the pressure of the gases, and occupies almost the entire empty volume (20) thus countering gas leaks while giving good thermal insulation (lagging).

<CLAIMS>
Turbomachine wall comprising an outer casing (1),
a shell ring surrounded by the casing and composed of

segments (5) which are joined together and, by flanges
(4), joined to the casing, and which, together with the

casing and the flanges, delimit partitioned cavities
(20), the said cavities being occupied by a sealing body

(25, 125) formed of a flexible envelope (27) made of
fabric and of a fibrous filling (26), in which wall the

flexible envelope is not very permeable to air and
deforms under the action of the various pressures around

it so that it closely matches the shapes of the cavities
(20).
Turbomachine wall according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the sealing body is also formed of a

spring (28) contained in the flexible envelope and
compressed to a smaller cross section than in the free

state.
Turbomachine wall according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the spring in cross section has the shape

of an opened-out hairpin.
