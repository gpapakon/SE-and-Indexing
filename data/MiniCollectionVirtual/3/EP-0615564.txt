<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD ANDENZYMATIC PREPARATIONFORTREATMENT OFCELLULOS PULPSThe present invention concerns a method in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 for treatment of lignocellulosic material, in particular cellulose pulps.The invention also concerns an enzymatic preparation which is useful for pulp treatment according to the preamble of claim 20.In traditional chlorine bleaching the residual lignin is solubilized by using chlorine or chlorine dioxide. Presently cellulose pulps are frequently also bleached by oxygen gas, hydrogen peroxide, ozone or by combined sequences including these substances as well as the above-mentioned traditional bleaching chemicals. Enzymatic treatments, carried out by hemicellulases or lignin degrading enzymes, have been combined with the traditional and new bleaching sequences leading to increased bleachability of the fibres. The amounts of enzymes needed to achieve the improved bleachability are low, and the enzymatic treatment can easily be incorporated into the pulp production processes.According to the prior art, enzymatic treatments have been performed directly on fibres from the pulping processes. According to our results we have found out that the properties of the cellulosic fibres profoundly affect the possibilities of enzymes to act efficiently on the pulps. Thus, e.g. xylanases act unoptimally when the surface charge, i.e. the zeta potential is very low. We have also observed that kraft pulps, treated at a low pH-value, at which the carboxylic groups of the hemicelluloses present in the pulp are in an acid form and do not thus contain metal counter ions, are very poor substrates for enzymatic (hemicellulase) treatments.In the prior art methods, these factors have not at all been considered, nor has any attempt been made to modify the state of the fibres to make them more suitable as substrates for enzymatic treatment.It is known that the carboxylic groups present in cellulose pulps affect mainly the surface 

 charge of the pulp (Sjδstrom 1989). The number of these groups depends essentially on the pulping method used. Thus, the carboxylic groups in kraft as well as in mechanical pulps consist mainly of methylglucuronic acid groups in xylan (Sjδstrom 1989). However, in sulphite pulps, in addition to the methyl glucuronic acid groups of xylan, the carboxylic groups comprise sulphonic acids present in lignin, formed during the sulphite pulping process.The strength and degree of dissociation of the carboxylic groups depends on the counter-ion of the carboxylic group
