<ABSTRACT>
It is known to use rotating drums in photographic processing apparatus. However, in many embodiments, relatively large volumes of processing solution are required for effective operation of the apparatus. This makes most drum arrangements unsuitable for use with unstable chemistry and single use chemistry as the processing solutions need to be replaced frequently. Described herein is photographic processing apparatus which incorporates a drum arrangement to form a low volume processing tank. The arrangement comprises a processing tank (10) in which a central rotatable drum (20) is mounted. A clearance of less than 5 mm is provided between the tank (10) and the drum (20) which defines a low volume for the processing solution (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
processing apparatus and is more particularly 
concerned with the processing of small areas of 
photographic material, for example, prints on 
photographic paper. It is well-known to use rotating drums in 
photographic processing apparatus. US-A-4 613 223 
discloses an arrangement in which a flexible sheet of 
photographic material is driven along an endless 
curved path within a processing tank by passing the 
sheet through nips formed between at least one pair of 
driven rollers. At least one of the driven rollers is 
the drum itself. During processing, the emulsion 
(sensitive) surface of the sheet is arranged not to 
come into contact with any stationary part of the 
processing vessel as it is being processed. This 
prevents damage to the surface during processing. 
After driving the sheet around the endless path for a 
predetermined number of cycles, which defines the 
processing time, the sheet is then directed out of the 
processing tank. The arrangement described above, has the 
disadvantage that little or no agitation is applied to 
the emulsion surface of the photographic material 
being processed. This may result in uneven processing 
of the material and variable sensitometry. Furthermore, relatively large volumes of 
processing solution are required which makes the 
arrangement disclosed unsuitable for unstable 
processing chemistry and single use chemistry as large 
volumes of processing solutions need to be discarded 
on a regular basis. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide photographic processing apparatus 
which overcomes the problems mentioned above.  
 According to one aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided photographic processing 
apparatus including at least one processing stage, 
each processing stage comprising:- 
a generally U-shaped vessel; a central rotating drum driven by first driving means and arranged within the 
vessel to define a processing tank, the clearance 
between the vessel and the drum being substantially 
constant; and at least one pair of drive rollers 
associated with the processing stage which is arranged 
to direct photographic material into and through the 
tank during processing, the rollers being driven by second driving means at a 
rate to ensure that processing is achieved as the 
material passes through the processing tank; characterized in that the first driving means determining the speed of rotation 
of the drum is controlled independently of the second driving means

<CLAIMS>
Photographic processing apparatus 
including at least one processing stage, each 

processing stage comprising:- 

a generally U-shaped vessel (10); 
a central rotating drum (20) driven by first driving means and arranged within 
the vessel (10) to define a processing tank, the 

clearance between the vessel (10) and the drum (20) 
being substantially constant; and 
at least one pair of drive rollers (40, 42) 
associated with the processing stage which is arranged 

to direct photographic material (50) into and through 
the tank during processing, the rollers (40, 42) being 

driven by second driving means at a rate to ensure that processing is achieved 
as the material (50) passes through the processing 

tank; 
characterized in that said first driving means determining the speed of rotation 
of the drum (20) is controlled independently of said second driving means determining the 

speed of the drive rollers (40, 42). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein 
the clearance is less than 5mm. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein 
the clearance is less than 2mm. 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the drum (20) is hollow. 
Apparatus according to any one of 
preceding claims, wherein the at least one pair of 

rollers (40, 42) is positioned at the inlet (14) to 
the processing stage with which it is associated. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, wherein 
a second pair of rollers (44, 46) is provided at the 

outlet (16) from the processing stage for directing 
the processed material (50) out of that stage. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein 
the second pair of rollers (44, 46) form squeegee  

 
rollers for removing excess processing solution (30)as 

the material (50) leaves the processing stage. 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, arranged so that the photographic material 

(50) to be processed is fed into the processing stage 
with its emulsion surface against the surface of the 

drum (20). 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the surface of the drum (20) 

is textured to assist in the uptake of processing 
solution (30) from the processing tank. 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the drum (20) has a diameter 

of 10cm and is of length 30cm. 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the drum (20) is heated.
