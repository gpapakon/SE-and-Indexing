<ABSTRACT>
There is described a process for preparing transition metals of the groups VIIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table with the exception of Fe, Co and Ni in metallic form or as oxide, by decomposition of corresponding volatile transition metal compounds, wherein the transition metal compounds used are organometallic oxides of the general formula RaMebOc (I), where R is   -a saturated or unsaturated, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl radical having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, -a monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms -a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms or -an aromatic  pi -bonded ligand having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms in the ring,  Me = the transition metal concerned,  O = oxygen and  a has a value from 1 to 12,  b has a value from 1 to 3, c has a value from 1 to 8.o
