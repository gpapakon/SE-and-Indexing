<ABSTRACT>
In an image coding and decoding device, input 
digital image signals are divided into blocks of prescribed 

size, and coding processing is performed to differential 
signal taken between the input block signal and interframe 

forcasting signal thereby transmission recording is 
performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image coding
and decoding device, and more particularly to an image
coding and decoding device which can efficiently code
and decode the motion image signals so as to transmit
and record the signals by the interframe coding.FIG. 5 is a block diagram which shows a composition
example of a transmission section of an interframe coding
device disclosed, for example, in the Technical Report
of the Institute of Electronics and Communication
Engineers of Japan IE84-1 ('84). In FIG. 5, numeral
201 designates the digitalized motion image signal
system, numeral 207 designates a subtractor for
obtaining the interframe differential signals, numeral
208 designates the interframe predicting signals formed
from the past time frame which already finished coding,
numeral 209 designates the interframe differential
signal system, numeral 210 designates a block
discrimination section which quantizes the interframe
differential signals 209 of the predicting error to 
naught, and discriminates block by block whether the
naught, and discriminates block by block whether the
coding at the next stage needs or not, numeral 211
designates the threshold value for the block discrimination,
numeral 212 a coding control section which decides
the threshold value 211, numeral 213 designates a coding
and decoding section which encodes and decodes the
blocks judges as the significant predicting errors (they
are called as the significant blocks or the blocks whose
predicting errors are regarded as naught are called
ineffective blocks) in the block discriminating section
210, numeral 214 designates the decoded predicting error
signals obtained in the coding and decoding section 213,
numeral 215 designates an adder which adds the predicting
signals 208 to the decoded predicting error signals 214,
numeral 216 designates the decoding image signal system,
numeral 217 designates a frame memory which forms the
interframe predicting signals 208 using the decoded
image signal series 216, numeral 218 designates the
coded data obtained in the coding and decoding section
213, numeral 219 designates a variable length coding
section which encodes the coded data 218 in variable
length, numeral 220 designates a buffer for smoothing
where the variable length coding data system processes
in the variable length coding section 219 is transmitted
at the constant transmitting speed, numeral 221 designates
the data that count the variable length coding data
system per frame (the amount of the generated 
information per frame),
