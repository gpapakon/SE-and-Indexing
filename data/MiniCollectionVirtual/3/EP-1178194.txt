<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine is constructed to include a
variable compression ratio mechanism. The mechanism has the

following structure. An upper link has one end pivotally
connected to a piston pin of a piston of the engine. A lower link

is pivotally disposed on a crank pin of a crankshaft of the engine
and has one part pivotally connected to the other end of the

upper link. A control shaft extends substantially in parallel with
the crankshaft. A control link has an end pivotally connected to

the other part of the lower link. The other end of the control link
is connected to the control shaft through an eccentric bearing

structure, so that rotation of the control shaft about its axis
induces a pivoting of the lower link about the crank pin varying

the stroke of the piston.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engines according to the preamble of independent claim 1.Such an internal combustion engine can be taken from the prior art document JP 2000-73804 A.In order to clarify the task of the present invention, one known internal combustion engine of the above-mentioned type will be briefly described with reference to Fig. 42 of the accompanying drawings, which is shown in a paper "MTZ Motortechnische Zeitschrift 58" issued in 1997 in Germany.As shown in the drawing, the engine having a variable compression ratio mechanism incorporated therewith is of a four cylinder type.The mechanism comprises four upper links 2 each having one end pivotally connected to a piston pin 1a of a corresponding piston 1, four lower links 4 each being pivotally disposed on a crank pin of a crankshaft 3 and having one end pivotally connected to the corresponding upper link 2, a control shaft 5 extending in parallel with the crankshaft 3 and four control links 6 each having one end pivotally connected to the corresponding upper link 2 and the other end pivotally connected to the control shaft 5 through an eccentric cam 5a. When the control shaft 5 is rotated about its axis to an angular position, the fulcrum of each control link 6 is changed and thus the actual distance between the piston pin 1a and the corresponding crank pin of the crankshaft 3 is varied changing the stroke of the piston 1. Due to change of the piston stroke, the compression ratio of the engine can be varied.However, due to its inherent construction, the variable compression ratio mechanism of the above-mentioned type has failed to provide the engine with a compact construction. That is, provision of the control shaft 5, which is positioned away from the crankshaft 3 in a lateral direction of the engine, causes a largely expanded structure of one side wall of a cylinder block of the engine.Prior art document DE 29 913 107 U1 teaches an internal combustion engine with a cylinder block having a cylinder in which a piston reciprocates. A crankshaft is rotatably installed in said cylinder block, wherein said crankshaft includes a crank pin. A variable compression ratio mechanism including an upper link having one end pivotally connected to a piston pin of said piston, a lower link pivotally disposed on said crank pin of the crankshaft and having one part pivotally connected to the other end of said upper link, a control link having a first end pivotally connected to another part of said lower link and a second end
