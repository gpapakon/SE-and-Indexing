<ABSTRACT>
The variable equalizer with fan-shaped characteristic (FE) contains the series circuit of a first summation circuit (SU1) to whose first input (1) an input signal (ES) is fed, a variable amplifier (V1) and a second summation circuit (SU2) to which the input signal (ES) is also fed and which emits an equalized output signal (AS) and a second series circuit of a second variable amplifier (V2) and an integrator (IG) whose output (12) is fed back to a second input of the first summation circuit (SU1). The variable amplifiers (V1, V2) can be digitally set through the use of multiplying D/A converters (DAC-A, DAC-B, DAC-C). The amplitude of the equalization characteristics which are particularly suitable for audio and telephone lines can be set and said characteristics can be shifted parallel in the direction of the frequency axis.
