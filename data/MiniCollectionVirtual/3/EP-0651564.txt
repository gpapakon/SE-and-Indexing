<ABSTRACT>
An amplifying circuit for dynamic focus of the invention applies, in a 
DC feedback loop of amplifying circuit for horizontal dynamic focus, a 

parabolic waveform signal for correction of vertical dynamic focus to a non-inverting 
input terminal or inverting input terminal of a detection amplifier 

for DC feedback, or to an input terminal of a DC control circuit, and 
superposes on a parabolic waveform signal for correction of horizontal 

dynamic focus in an amplifying circuit for horizontal dynamic focus through 
the DC control circuit, thereby stabilizing the DC action point in the 

amplifying circuit for horizontal dynamic focus, and also obtaining the 
parabolic waveform signal for correction of horizontal dynamic focus 

superposing the parabolic waveform signal for correction of vertical dynamic 
focus from the output terminal of the amplifying circuit for horizontal 

dynamic focus. Therefore, the amplifying circuit for vertical dynamic focus 
required in the prior art is not necessary, and hence the circuit may be 

simplified. 
Moreover, it is free from distortion of waveform, as experienced in the 
prior art, when adding after individually amplifying the parabolic waveform 

signal for correction of horizontal dynamic focus and parabolic waveform 
signal for correction of vertical dynamic focus, and therefore the distortion  

 
can be kept low as compared with the prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amplifying circuit for dynamic focus
for correcting dynamic focus of television receiver or CRT monitor using a
cathode-ray tube.In a television receiver or CRT monitor, recently, the surface of the
cathode-ray tube tends to be flat. At the same time, as the definition is
becoming higher, the scanning becomes faster. In this situation, a higher
definition of the screen is strongly demanded.At the present, therefore, dynamic focus correction is standard in the
television receiver or CRT monitor using a cathode-ray tube.Conventional amplifying circuits for dynamic focus are described below.
Fig. 7 is a block diagram of an amplifying circuit for dynamic focus in a
prior art. Fig. 8 is a circuit diagram showing a practical circuit of the
amplifying circuit for dynamic focus in the prior art.In Fig. 7, an amplifying circuit 71 for horizontal dynamic focus
receives, amplifies, and delivers a parabolic waveform signal for horizontal 
dynamic focus correction synchronized with a horizontal sync signal.In a detection amplifier 72 for DC feedback, the output of the
amplifying circuit 71 for horizontal dynamic focus is divided by using two
series resistors, and entered in a non-inverting input terminal, and
horizontal parabolic components are filtered by connecting a capacitor
between this dividing point and the ground. On the other hand, a supply
voltage +VL is divided by two series resistors, and entered in an inverting
input terminal, and is connected to the ground through a capacitor from this
dividing point. A differential voltage between the non-inverting input
terminal and inverting input terminal is amplified, and is delivered to a DC
control circuit 73.In the DC control circuit 73, by the output from the detecting amplifier
72 for DC feedback, the DC action point of the amplifying circuit 71 for
horizontal dynamic focus is controlled.In this constitution, a DC feedback loop is constructed in order to
deliver output voltage without distortion by stabilizing the DC action point
of the amplifying circuit 71 for horizontal dynamic focus.To an amplifying circuit 74 for vertical dynamic focus, consequently, a
parabolic waveform signal for correcting the vertical dynamic focus
synchronized with the vertical sync signal is entered and amplified, and its 
output voltage is applied to a coupling point of a resistor
and a grounded capacitor, after the output voltage of the amplifying circuit
71 for horizontal dynamic focus passes through the capacitor for AC coupling,
that is, the
