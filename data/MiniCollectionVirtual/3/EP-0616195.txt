<ABSTRACT>
A fiber optic gyroscope is formed of two distinct 
sections (20, 22), one having optical paths of low-birefringence 

fiber and the other having paths formed 
of polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber. The two 

sections are joined at a low-birefringence-PM fiber 
splice (24, 26, 28). The PM section includes at least 

one MIOC (30, 32, 34) and an associated rotation 
sensing coil (42, 44, 46) of PM fiber while the low-birefringence 

section includes the optical source (62), 
and associated couplers and detectors. The arrangement 

minimizes polarization fading and polarization non-reciprocity 
(PNR) bias error while allowing maximum use 

of lower cost and, in many cases, more durable 
components to minimize overall system cost without loss 

of performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The measurement of rotation is of considerable
importance in many areas ranging from missile and aircraft
guidance to spacecraft applications.The spinning wheel or mechanical gyroscope
method has been utilized for many years. Despite wide
acceptance, this approach is subject to disadvantages that
are known in the navigation-guidance field. These include
relatively brief lifetimes due to the continuous motion of
component parts and high component cost. Optical instruments based on the Sagnac effect,
such as the ring laser gyroscope, have begun to replace
mechanical gyroscopes in many applications. The
development of low scatter mirrors and high quality gas
discharge tubes for generating laser light have hastened
the development of this technology. However, the ring
laser gyroscope is subject to the phenomenon of frequency-locking
at low rotation rates, which can eliminate the
rotation-induced frequency beat at such low rates.The fiber optic gyroscope has emerged as an
alternative to the ring laser gyro that is not subject to
the problem of frequency lock-in at low rotation rates.
Moreover, the fiber optic gyroscope offers the potential
of reduced cost. Accordingly, this instrument may be
suitable for large-volume, low and medium accuracy
navigation and guidance systems.Fiber optic gyroscopes initially employed low-birefringence
fiber similar to that used in the optical
fiber communications industry. A schematic diagram of a
typical low-birefringence fiber optic gyroscope of the
prior art is shown in Figure 1. Such a device comprises a
laser diode light source 10, two beam splitters 12 and 14
(or fiber directional couplers) to route the light, a
photodetector 16, a multiturn fiber coil 18 that acts as 
the rotation sensing component, and a phase modulator 20
consisting of either a piezoelectric cylinder or a single-channel
LiNbO3 waveguide modulator. The Sagnac phase
shift is a relativistic effect that originates from a
rotation-induced differential phase shift between
counterpropagating waves.One of the most notorious problems of fiber
optic gyroscopes made with low birefringence fiber and low
birefringence optical components is a large bias drift due
to the random and unpredictable exchanges of power between
the fiber's two polarization states. This bias
instability, also known as polarization non-reciprocity
(PNR) bias error, is briefly described below.As described by Ezekiel and Arditty in "Fiber
Optic Rotation Sensors: Tutorial Review," Proceedings of
First International Conference on Fiber Optic
