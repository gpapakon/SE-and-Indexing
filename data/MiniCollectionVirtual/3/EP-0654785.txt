<ABSTRACT>
An error signal generating circuit for adjusting a 
position of a sub-beam on an optical disc to a correct one. A 

timing circuit generates a test signal so that a driver drives 
a tracking coil. As a result, a difference signal is generated 

in a difference signal generating circuit and is then 
compared to a reference value in a comparing circuit. A 

controlling signal is generated in a controlling circuit in 
reply to a comparing error so as to be held in a holding 

circuit. The thus held controlling signal is converted into 
an analog signal in a D/A converter and is then applied to a 

VCA to vary the amplifying rate, such that the difference 
signal becomes zero when a correct tracking operation is being 

carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an error signal generating
circuit which can be applied to an optical disc reproducing
apparatus.Generally in an optical disc reproducing apparatus,
there has been known, as a method for detecting errors in the
tracking direction of the optical disc, a so-called 3-beam
method including a main beam used for controlling a digital
data reading operation or focus controlling operation, and two
sub-beams used for following the track. FIG. 1 shows an
example of a circuit for generating a tracking error signal by
the use of sub-beams and adjusting the position of the sub-beams
on the optical disc.In FIG. 1, photo diodes 1 and 2 detect reflected light
of the sub-beams and generate a detecting signal in reply to
the amount of the reflected light. After being amplified in
amplifiers 3 and 4, the detected signal is input to LPFs 5 and
6 to get rid of any high-frequency component due to pits. The
pits-free detected signals are then mutually subtracted in a
difference signal generating circuit 7 to generate a difference
signal which is used as a tracking error signal. The
difference signal is phase-compensated in a servo phase compensating 
circuit 8 and is then applied to a driver 9 which
corrects the position of the sub-beams on the optical disc by
driving the tracking coil 10 to cause the difference signal to
become zero.In such a 3-beam method, when the sub-beams are accurately
tracking on the optical disc, the amount of reflected
light of the sub-beams is the same. This means that the
magnitude of the detected signals from the photo diodes 1 and
2 is the same, so as not to render any difference signal. As
a result, no operation for correcting the sub-beam position on
the optical disc is carried out. In the case of any tracking
error taking place, the amount of reflection of the sub-beams
will become different, so that the difference signal generating
circuit 7 generates a difference signal to correct the
sub-beam position for accurately performing the tracking
operation. In this manner, it is possible to always track
stably and correctly on the disc.In such a system, however, there has been a fear of
generating a tracking error even if the sub-beams are in the
correct positions on the optical disc because the opto-current
conversion efficiencies of the pair of photo diodes 1 and 2
are different from each other.To cope with the above-mentioned disadvantage, there has
been carried out an adjustment in order not to generate any
tracking error signal at a position where the
