<ABSTRACT>
A fastening device (22) for sporting footwear, in particular for 
ski-boots, is interposed between shell (12) and boot leg (18) of the 

ski-boot and comprises at least a first and a second member (24,26) 
hinged between each other at one of their ends; the opposite ends of the 

members are hinged to the shell (12) and boot leg (18) respectively and 
one of the members (24,26) is provided with an operating arm (40). The 

first member (24) consists of at least two structural portions (34,36) 
connected between each other at one of their ends so as to be movable 

between each other making the first member extensible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastening device for sporting footwear
which comprise reclining portions as for example it occurs in the
moto-cross shoes or ski-boots for the "snow-board" or in the
mountaineering skiing and, in particular, for the rear tightening of the
boot leg for the ski-boots.With reference to the latter case, it is known that the ski-boots
comprise a rigid shell to which a boot leg is hinged having the function
to wrap the lower portion of the skier's leg and to allow to vary the
bending of the leg with respect to the foot and then to the ski. Finally,
in order to make more comfortable the fit of the ski-boot, an inner shoe
is housed inside the shell and boot leg, a shoe made of soft material.The fastening device includes at least a first and a second member hinged
between each other at one of their ends, the opposite ends of said
members being hinged to the shell and boot leg respectively, one of said
member being provided with an operating arm.With reference to the way by which the foot is put into the ski-boot,
there exist substantially two kinds of ski-boots. A first type, the
so-called front-entry ski-boot, wherein usually there are two flaps on
the front portion of the ski-boot defining an opening that can be opened
wide through which the foot is put into. The second type, known as
rear-entry ski-boot, consists of a shell, a front tongue and a boot leg.It clearly appears that the rear-entry ski-boots allow a more easy entry
of the foot into the ski-boot. Furthermore these ski-boots have a good
seal against water and snow.However, these ski-boots have some drawbacks due to the fact that, in
order to allow the entry of the foot, the distance between the ski-boot
portion corresponding to the instep and the ski-boot portion wherein the
heel is housed, must be increased.Consequently, the tickness of the shoe portion corresponding to the
instep must be increased achieving a little effective contact between the
foot and the ski-boot.At least, another problem is the lack of the boot leg inclination
adjusting with respect to the shell.Therefore, central-entry ski-boots have been conceived and made which are
similar to the rear-entry ski-boots, these ski-boots, however, being
provided with devices which allow the backward inclination of the boot 
leg with respect to the shell in order to facilitate the entry of the
foot thus achieving the usual advantages of the rear-entry ski-boots.Such a kind of ski-boots has another advantage which consists in
facilitating walking when the boot

<CLAIMS>
Fastening device for sporting footwear, in particular for ski-boots, of the
type comprising a rigid shell (12) on which a boot leg (18) is hinged, the fastening

device (22) being interposed between said shell (12) and boot leg (18) and
including: at least a first and a second member (24,26) hinged to each other at one

of their ends, and respectively to the shell (12) and to the boot leg (18) at their
opposite ends, wherein the first member consists of at least two connected portions

(34,36) so as to be movable with respect to each other thereby making the first
member extensible, whilst the second member is provided with an operating arm

(40),
extending on said opposite end hinging said second member (26) to the boot leg (18)

characterised in that the second member (26) is hinged to the boot leg (18) in
a position between its end connected to the first member and the operating arm

(40). 
Fastening device according to claim 1, characterized in that said at
least two structural portions (34,36) are two cranks hinged between each

other.
Fastening device according to claim 2, characterized in that said at
least two structural portions (34,36) consists of four cranks hinged

between each other at their ends in order to form an articulated
quadrilateral having two opposite corners hinged to the shell (12) or

boot leg (18) and to the second member (26) respectively.
Fastening device according to claim 1, characterized in that said at
least two structural portions (34,36) are hinged between each other so as

to allow a relative sliding so that the first member (24) is extensible.
Fastening device according to claim 4, characterized in that one of
said at least two structural portions (34,36) has at least one groove in

which at least a jut of the other structural portion slides.
Fastening device according to claim 4, characterized in that one of
said at least two structural portions (34,36) is into tubular-shaped
