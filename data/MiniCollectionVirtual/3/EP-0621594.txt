<ABSTRACT>
A magazine for data carriers, for use with a rotatable opening element, has a 
housing with a box-like base, the base having an open top and a cover formed by 

separable cover halves being disposed over the top of the base. The base has at least 
one receptacle therein for receiving a data carrier, such a magnetic tape cartridge. The 

magazine is intended for insertion in a data reader, which removes the data carrier from 
the magazine and inserts it in a drive for reading the data therefrom. The halves of the 

housing are mounted on the base for respective rotation around first and second axes 
parallel to a longitudinal edge of the base, and disposed inwardly of all edges of the base. 

A rotatable opening element is engageable with at least one of the housing halves to 
cause the housing halves to rotate around their respective axes, when the magazine is 

moved toward the opening element, to move the halves apart, over the sides of the base, 
to open the magazine to permit removal of a data carrier therefrom. Moving the 

magazine away from the opening element causes the halves to rotate to their closed 
position. The cover halves each carry half of a handle thereon, so that when closed they 

provide a complete handle for carrying the magazine with data carriers therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a magazine for carrying a plurality of data
carriers, such as magnetic tape cartridges, of the type insertable in a loading device
having a data reader, for selective removal of one of the data carriers from the magazine
for use in said reader.It is known to record and store data on a number of different types of storage
media, such as magnetic tape, optical disks and the like. Because of the limited size of
such data carriers, the amount of data which can be stored thereon is similarly limited.
In computing and data retrieval systems wherein a large amount of data is stored, a
relatively large number of such data carriers are required in order to contain all of the
necessary data. To retrieve the data from the data carrier, it is necessary to insert the
carrier into a data reader, such as a tape drive unit. (As used herein, the unit into which
the data carrier is inserted will be referred to as a "reader," although it may also be used
for the purpose of writing data on the carrier.)In systems requiring multiple data carriers, it is cumbersome to manually
successively insert and remove the data carriers from the reader. Many such systems,
therefore, employ a data carrier magazine, which holds a large number of data carriers,
with the magazine being loadable into a device which contains the reader. A selected
data carrier can then be removed from the magazine, and inserted into the reader
wherein the data on the carrier is read, or new data is written on the carrier. After the
completion of the read or write operation, the data carrier is then automatically removed
from the reader and is replaced in the magazine. The device which removes the data 
carrier from the magazine, inserts it in the reader, and removes it from the reader and
replaces it in the magazine is generically known as a "loader." Loaders can generally be
classified into three types: those in which the magazine is stationary in the loader and the
drive is moved over the magazine to the position of a selected data carrier in the
magazine, those wherein the reader is stationary and the magazine is moved to position
a selected tape at a location for insertion in the reader, and those wherein both the
magazine and the reader are stationary, and an "elevator" or other type of data carrier
transfer mechanism is used to remove a selected data carrier from the magazine,
transport it to, and insert it in the reader. Various combinations of these three basic types
of units are also known.The configuration of the

<CLAIMS>
A magazine (1) for data carrier units (19), comprising:

a housing having a box-like base (2) having a longitudinal
edge (2a) and having an open top with a cover comprising

first and second separable halves (3, 4) disposed over
said top;
said base (2) having at least one receptacle (18)
therein for holding a data carrier unit (19), said receptacle

(18) having an open top disposed at said top of said base (2)
for inserting and removing a data carrier unit (19) into and

from the receptacle (18);
said first and second separable halves (3, 4) being
mounted on said base (2);

   characterized in that

said first and second separable halves (3, 4) are mounted
on said base (2) for respective rotation around

first and second rotational axes parallel to said
longitudinal edge (2a) to move said first and second

separable halves (3, 4) apart to an open position to expose
said top of said base and to move said first and second

separable halves (3, 4) to a closed position to cover said
top of said base (2); and 
rotary motion transfer means (11)
for rotating

said first and second separable halves (3, 4) around said
first and second rotational axes

are provided.
A magazine (1) as claimed in claim 1, further comprising
bearings (9, 10) disposed on said first and second axes on

which said first and second separable halves (3, 4) are
respectively mounted for rotation around said first and
