<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to a catalyst system for use in the alkylation of isoparaffin with olefins. More specifically, this invention is directed to an improved catalyst system containing specified amounts of water and a component of that system comprising certain transition aluminas promoted with a Lewis acid (preferably BF3). In addition, this invention is a catalytic process for the alkylation of isoparaffin with olefins. The catalyst component is produced by contacting the transition alumina with the Lewis acid at relatively low temperatures. The catalyst system comprises that component and an additional amount of free Lewis acid. The process entails isoparaffin alkylation with olefins using the catalyst component and its allied catalyst system.

IMPROVED LEWIS ACID PROMOTED TRANSITION ALUMINA CATALYSTS AND ISOPARAFFIN ALKYLATION PROCESSES USING THOSE CATALYSTSField of the InventionThis invention is to: a) a catalyst system, b) an improved catalyst system containing specified amounts of water, c) a component of that system comprising certain transition aluminas promoted with a Lewis acid (preferably BF3) , and d) a catalytic process for the alkylation of isoparaffin with olefins. The catalyst component is produced by contacting the transition alumina with the Lewis acid at relatively low temperatures. The catalyst system comprises that component and an additional amount of free Lewis acid. The process entails olefin/isoparaffin alkylation using the catalyst component and its allied catalyst system.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe preparation of high octane blending components for motor fuels using strong acid alkylation processes (notably where the acid is hydrofluoric acid or sulfuric acid) is well-known. Alkylation is the reaction in which an alkyl group is added to an organic molecule, typically an aromatic or olefinic molecule. For production of gasoline blending stocks, the reaction is between an isoparaffin and an olefin. Alkylation processes have been in wide use since World War II when high octane gasolines were needed to 

satisfy demands from high compression ratio or supercharged aircraft engines. The early alkylation units were built in conjunction with fluid catalytic cracking units to take advantage of the light end by- products of the cracking units: isoparaffins and olefins. Fluidized catalytic cracking units still constitute the major source of feedstocks for gasoline alkylation units. In spite of the mature state of strong acid alkylation technology, existing problems with the hydrofluoric and sulfuric acid technologies continue to be severe: disposal of the used acid, unintentional emission of the acids during use or storage, substantial corrosivity of the acid catalyst systems, and other environmental concerns. Although a practical alkylation process using solid acid catalysts having little or no corrosive components has long been a goal, commercially viable processes do not exist.The open literature shows several systems used to alkylate various hydrocarbon feedstocks.The American Oil Company obtained a series of patents in the mid-1950's on alkylation processes involving 

 (preferably Gj or C3) olefins and C4-C8 isoparaffins. The catalysts used were BF3-treated solids and the catalyst system (as used in the alkylation
