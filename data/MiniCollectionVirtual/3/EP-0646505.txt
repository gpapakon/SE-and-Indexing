<ABSTRACT>
A gas generator (30) of a gas generating device 
(100) is held by a cover (34) within a housing (11) of 

a webbing pretensioner (10). The cover (34) defines 
therethrough a hammer pin insertion hole (35). The 

hammer pin insertion hole (35) has an inner diameter 
smaller than the outer diameter of a fastening member 

such as a self-tapping screw (39) or that of a tool 
such as a screw driver, which is to be employed upon 

assembly and/or mounting of the gas generating device 
(100). This has made it possible to avoid accidental 

insertion of the fastening member or the tool into the 
hammer pin insertion hole (35) in the course of the assembling 

or mounting work and hence, to prevent a 
detonator (33) of the gas generator (30) from being accidentally 

struck.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas generating device for actuating
a safety apparatus such as an air bag system or a webbing
pretensioner of a seat belt system, for example, in the event of
an emergency such as a collision of an automotive vehicle so that
an occupant can be protected.JP-A-05 154371, which describes a gas generating device according to the
preamble of claim 1, discloses a gas generating device of this kind,
comprising a gas generator having a detonator for being fired
when struck by a hammer pin and a hammer pin trigger device for
causing said hammer pin to strike said detonator in the event of
an emergency, wherein the gas generator has a cover arranged to
substantially close up the gas generator on the side of the
hammer pin trigger device and defining therethrough a hammer pin
insertion hole, into which the hammer pin is inserted. The hammer
pin has a small-diameter portion located on the side of the
detonator and a large-diameter portion on the side opposite to
the detonator, which large-diameter portion is provided for
supporting a spring by which the hammer pin is biassed to strike
the detonator. Further, a spring-biassed lever is provided for
holding the hammer pin in a starting position, wherein the lever
engages the large-diameter portion of the hammer pin opposite to
the spring biassing the hammer pin. Gas generating devices are available in two
types, one being electrically fired and the other mechanically
fired. Mechanical devices are however finding 
increasing popularity in recent years for their
simpler construction and lower price.Referring first to FIGS. 3 and 4, a description
will hereinafter be made of a conventional
mechanically-triggered gas generating device as applied
to a pretensioner of a webbing retractor in an automotive
seat belt system.FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the conventional
gas generating device as applied to the webbing
pretensioner, and FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view illustrating
a problem inherent to the conventional gas
generating device.As is illustrated in FIG. 3, a frame 1 of a webbing
retractor (not shown) for an unillustrated automotive
vehicle, said frame having been formed by bending
a steel plate, has a bracket 2 for mounting a gas generating
device 90 on the webbing retractor. A
pretensioner 10 and a hammer pin trigger device 20 are
arranged on left-hand and right-hand side walls of the
bracket 2 as viewed in the figure. The pretensioner 10
and the hammer pin trigger device 20 are fixed together
by bolts 29, with the bracket 2 being

<CLAIMS>
A gas generating device comprising:

a hammer pin;
a gas generator (30) having a detonator (33) accommodated
in a housing (11) for being fired when

struck by said hammer pin (24); and
a hammer pin trigger device (20) for causing said
hammer pin to strike said detonator in the event of an

emergency of a vehicle on which said gas generating
device is mounted;

wherein said gas generator has a cover (34) arranged
to substantially close up said gas generator on

a side of said hammer pin trigger device and defining
therethrough a hammer pin insertion hole (35) into

which said hammer pin (24) is inserted, and said
hammer pin insertion hole of said cover has such a small inner

diameter that no fastening member to be
employed for assembling or mounting said gas generating

device can be inserted in said hammer pin insertion hole (35),

wherein said hammer pin (24) has a small-diameter portion
(24b) located on a side of said detonator and

capable of being inserted into said hammer pin insertion
hole of said cover, and a large-diameter portion

(24c) extending from said small-diameter portion toward 
a side opposite to said detonator, characterised in

that
said hammer pin trigger device (20) has a

bottom-closed, substantially cylindrical housing member
(21), a hammer-pin-side cover (22) is arranged on a side

of an opening of said housing member and a spacer (23) is
arranged on an inner side of said hammer-pin-side cover

(22), that said spacer (23) centrally defines a through-hole
