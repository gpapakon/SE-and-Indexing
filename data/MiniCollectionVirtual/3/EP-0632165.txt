<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the working with a ground compactor which is driven by an internal combustion engine. The object of the invention is to provide a process, capable of being implemented with simple means, which makes it possible to determine and indicate the degree of ground compacting attained instantaneously by the ground compactor during operation, and which yields very accurate results, particularly towards the end of a ground-compacting operation. This is achieved in that the ground compactor is driven by an internal combustion engine which, by an overspeed protection control loop which reduces the fuel delivery volume or temporarily blocks the fuel supply when a predetermined maximum speed is exceeded, is protected against exceeding the predetermined maximum speed value, and in that the extent of the reduction of the fuel delivery volume or the period of time and/or frequency of the blockages of the fuel supply in a time interval are determined and used to form an indicating quantity for the ground-compacting degree attained at each instant.

<CLAIMS>
Process for determining and indicating the degree of ground compacting attained by a 
ground compactor at any moment during operation, characterised in that 


a) the compactor is driven by means of a combustion engine which is protected against 
exceeding a predetermined engine speed maximum value by an overspeed protection control 

circuit which shuts off the supply of fuel for a time in the case of the predetermined 
maximum engine speed being exceeded, and 
b) the duration and/or frequency of the fuel supply shut-offs is determined in a time interval 
and is used to form an indication variable for the momentarily achieved degree of ground 

compacting. 
Process according to claim 1, using an overspeed protection control circuit which controls 
the supply of fuel by means of a mechanical control device, characterised in that the position 

of the mechanical control device is detected by means of a sensor and is used to form the 
indication variable.
