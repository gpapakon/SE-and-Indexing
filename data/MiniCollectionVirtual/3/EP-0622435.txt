An aqueous dispersion containing 

A) a polyurethane essentially composed of 

a) organic polyisocyanates, 
b) polyhydroxy compounds having a molecular weight 
of from above 500 to 5,000 g/mol, 
c) compounds having at least one group reactive 
toward isocyanates and having at least one ionic 

group or group convertible into an ionic group, 
d) if required, compounds which differ from c) and 
have at least two functional groups reactive 

toward isocyanate and a molecular weight of from 
60 to 500 g/mol, 
 
and 
B) from 0.1 to 70% by weight, based on the polyurethane, 
of a free radical polymer containing metal 

salt groups, formed from at least divalent metals 
with acid groups of the polymer, the content of salt 

groups being from 5 to 1,000 mmol of salt groups per 
kg of the sum of A) and B). 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the metals from the metal salts of B) are 

divalent metals. 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the polymer B) is composed of 


a) from 3 to 60% by weight of an α,β-monoethylenically 

unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid of 3 to 5 
carbon atoms, 
b) from 97 to 40% by weight of at least one C
1
-C
20
-alkyl 
(meth)acrylate, one vinyl ester of a carboxylic acid 

of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, one vinyl aromatic of up to  
 

20 carbon atoms, one ethylenically unsaturated 
nitrile of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, one vinyl halide or 

one nonaromatic hydrocarbon having 4 to 8 carbon 
atoms and at least 2 conjugated double bonds and 
c) from 0 to 50% by weight of at least one further 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer 
 
and from 5 to 100 mol % of the acid groups from a) are 

converted into a metal salt group. 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 3, wherein the polymer B) containing salt groups is 

obtainable by reacting a polymer containing acid groups 
or anhydride groups with an oxide, hydroxide, carbonate 

or bicarbonate of a divalent metal. 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 4, wherein the dispersion additionally contains from 

5 to 60% by weight, based on the polyurethane, of an 
adhesion-improving polymer which differs from A) and B). 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 5, 
wherein the adhesion-improving polymer is added to the 

polyurethane or to a polyurethane prepolymer before 
dispersing in water and, in the case of the polyurethane 

prepolymer, the further reaction to give the polyurethane 
is then carried out. 
Use of an aqueous dispersion as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 6 as an adhesive. 
An adhesive bond obtainable using an aqueous 
dispersion as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6. 
Use of an aqueous dispersion as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 6 as a coating material. 
A coated substrate obtainable using an aqueous 
dispersion as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6.
