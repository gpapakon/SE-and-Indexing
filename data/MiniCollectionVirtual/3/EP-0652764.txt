<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates, in general, to the use of synthetic peptides to induce tolerance to immunogenic peptides. In particular, the present invention relates to a method of inducing tolerance in a mammal to an immunogenic peptide or protein comprising administering to a mammal a synthetic toleragen comprising a hydrophobic peptide linked to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the immunogenic peptide or protein, under conditions such that the tolerance is induced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in
general, to the use of synthetic peptides to
induce tolerance to immunogenic peptides. In
particular, the present invention relates to a
method of inducing tolerance in a mammal to an
immunogenic peptide or protein comprising
administering to a mammal a synthetic toleragen
comprising a 2 to 20 amino acid hydrophobic
peptide linked to the N-terminus or C-terminus of
the immunogenic peptide or protein, under
conditions such that the tolerance is induced.Many autoimmune diseases in animals and
man are characterized by T and B cell responses to
pathogenic epitopes on self antigens
(Immunotherapy of Diabetes and Selected Autoimmune
Diseases, G.S. Eisenbarth (ED) CRC Press, Boca
Raton, 1989; Current Therapy in Allergy,Immunology, and Rheumatology-3. L.M.
Lichtenstein, et al, B.C. Decker, Inc., Toronto,
1988). Examples of autoimmune diseases or disease
models that are caused by autoreactive B cells
responses are listed in Table 1. Examples of
autoimmune diseases or disease models that are
caused by autoreactive T cell responses are listed
in Table 2. A method to tolerize human
lymphocytes to not respond to pathogenic T and B
cell epitopes of autoantigens that otherwise
induce immune responses that cause tissue damage
would represent a significant advance in the
therapy of autoimmune diseases. Similarly,
multiple clinical situations exist outside the
setting of autoimmune disease, in which B and T
cell responses are harmful and would
advantageously be shut off or decreased. Examples
of pathogenic non-autoimmune antibody responses
are antibody responses to ABO incompatible
erythrocytes. A method to induce tolerance
against this type of immunogen would be a powerful
tool for treatment of a number of similar
conditions.Recently, it has also become clear that
tissue destruction in certain infectious diseases
is caused by immune responses against normal
tissue that are induced by infectious agents. For
example, in HTLV-I infection, the clinical
syndrome of HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM) has
been shown to be associated with the induction of
cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with a specific
region (SP4A1) OF HTLV-1 gp46 envelope
glycoprotein (S. Jacobson, et al, J. Immunol.
146:1155-1162, 1991). Similarly, lymphocytic
pneumonitis in HIV infection has been shown to be
associated with the presence in lung lymphocytes
of CTL specific for HIV infected cells (AIDS, 
B.D. Walker, et al, 4:177, 1990). In both HIV and
HTLV-1 infection, it is thought that certain
manifestations of the
