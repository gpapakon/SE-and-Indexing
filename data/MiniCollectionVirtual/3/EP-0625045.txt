<ABSTRACT>
Inflammatory dermatoses are controlled and cleared by topical application to the affected areas of the skin of a composition containing both a corticosteroid and a retinoid. The combined therapy is more effective than either active ingredient alone and is particularly effective for chronic dermatoses which are or have become resistant to corticosteroid treatment alone. After clearing has been obtained with once or twice daily applications of the corticosteroid-retinoid composition, usually after several weeks, clearance can be maintained by less frequent application or lower concentrations of the composition or by application of only one of the corticosteroid or retinoid, less potent corticosteroids, or other non-steroidal therapies, depending upon the particular dermatosis being treated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS OF TREATING INFLAMMATORY DERMATOSES Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to methods for the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses. More particularly, the invention is directed to controlling, clearing and maintaining the clearance of inflammatory dermatoses by administering topical compositions to the affected areas of the skin.Background of the inventionThe most widely prescribed drugs to treat dermatologic disease are corticosteroids, also known as glucocorticosteroids or glucocorticoids. Approximately 50% of prescriptions written by dermatologists are for topical corticosteroids. Since the introduction of these substances in the early 1950s for dermatologic diseases, topical corticosteroid therapy continues to be the mainstay for the management of a broad spectrum of inflammatory dermatoses. Although systemicSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

corticosteroids are often required in some severe dermatologic diseases, topical treatment is preferred in most responsive cases because it causes fewer systemic adverse effects. Topical corticosteroids are generally effective in the treatment of acute and chronic dermatoses such as sebcrrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis of the irritant and allergic type, localized neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus), lichen planus, and psoriasis. Steroids are also used for a variety of other less common conditions, such as Darier's disease and ichthyoεiform dermatitis. A good overview of topical corticosteroid therapy appears in a series of papers presented at the Symposium on Topical Corticosteroids Today and Tomorrow, sponsored by Schering AG in Bali, June 16-20, 1988, which were published in Drugs 36, Supplement 5, pp. 1-61 (Adis Press Ltd. 1988) .Individual topical corticosteroid preparations vary in anti-inflammatory potency and clinical efficacy. Therapeutic efficacy of steroid therapy can often be enhanced by increasing the potency of the steroid or by using special enhancers, such as occlusive dressings. In general, efficacy is dependent on multiple factors, viz. vehicle, site and frequency of application, disease, the individual patient, use cf occlusive dressings, etc. 

 Potency of the corticosteroid preparation varies according to the particular corticosteroid selected, its concentration, and its vehicle. For convenience, topical corticosteroids, are classified into seven groups from most (Group I) to least (Group VII) potent as shown, for example, in Table I below. Further, these classifications are ranked according to relative

CLAIMS
■
θ 1. A method of controlling and clearing inflammatory dermatoses except psoriasis comprising topically administering to the affected area of the skin a
5 composition comprising a corticosteroid and a retinoid, said corticosteroid and retinoid being present in amounts which are effective to control and clear said dermatosis.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein said dermatosis is selected from the group consisting of
10 inflammatory acne vulgaris, severe inflammtory acne conglobata, lichen planus, discoid lupus erythematosus, alopecia areata, pseudofolliculitis barbae, pityriasis rubra pilaris, mycosis fungoides, inflammatory rosacea, chronic atopic dermatitis, chronic contact dermatitis,
15 chronic hand dermatitis, and acute drug reactions.
3. A method according to claim 1 wherein said corticosteroid is present in said composition in an amount of about 0.00001 to 3 weight percent.
4. A method according to claim l wherein said 20 retinoid is present in said composition in an amount equivalent to about 0.0001 to 1 weight percent tretinoin. 


 5. A method according to claim 1 wherein said composition is applied to the skin once or twice daily until the dermatosiε is controlled and cleared, and thereafter clearance is maintained by less frequent application or lower concentration application of the composition or of a corticosteroid or a retinoid alone.
6. A method according to claim 5 wherein said less frequent application comprises about several applications per week of a corticosteroid or about once daily applications of a retinoid.
7. A method according to claim 1 wherein said corticosteroid is a group I to group V potency cortico¬ steroid.
8. A method according to claim 7 wherein said corticosteroid is selected from the group consisting of betamethasone valerate, triamcinolone acetonide, and clobetasol propionate.
9. A method according to claim 1 wherein said retinoid is tretinoin.
