Power-supply apparatus for powering a control circuit (2) for controlling a
power switch component (3), the apparatus powering said circuit from the

voltage across the terminals of the component in the off state, said apparatus
including an energy-storage capacitor (C2), and further including means (L, C1,

D1) for charging said energy-storage capacitor during the periods in which said
component is on, said power-supply apparatus being characterized in that said

means for charging the energy-storage capacitor during the periods in which said
component is on include:


an oscillating circuit (L, C1) connected across the terminals of said
component;
a "connection" element (D1) enabling the energy-storage capacitor (C2) to
be connected across the terminals of the inductance (L) of said oscillating circuit

once the energy stored in the capacitor (C1) of said oscillating circuit, during the
periods in which the component 3 is off, has been transferred to the inductance

(L), on switching said component on.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that it further includes
additional means (R2, D2, C2) for powering said control circuit on start-up.
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that said additional means for
powering said control circuit on start-up include means for charging said energy-storage

capacitor (C2) during the periods in which said component is off.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that, with
said control circuit having two possible consumption states, namely a high-consumption

state at the instants at which said component is switched on, and
low-consumption state at all other times, the apparatus further includes a first

power-supply circuit (R2, D2, R3, DZ1) connected across the terminals of said

component and supplying a "low-consumption" current during the periods in
which said component is off, and a second power-supply circuit (C2, R3, DZ1)

connected across the terminals of said energy-storage capacitor and supplying a
"high-consumption" current at the instants at which said component is switched

on, or a "low-consumption" current during the periods in which said component is
on. 
Apparatus according to claims 3 and 4, characterized in that said first power-supply
circuit includes said means for charging the energy-storage capacitor

during the periods in which said component is off.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it further
includes voltage-regulation means (R3, DZ1) supplying the power-supply voltage

of said control circuit from the voltage across the terminals of said energy-storage
capacitor.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that, with it
being possible for the value of the voltage across the terminals of the component

in the off state to vary within a certain range, the inductance (L) of said oscillating
circuit is dimensioned such that the energy is transferred from the capacitor (C1)

of the oscillating circuit to the inductance (L) prior to saturation thereof, for the
minimum value of the voltage, and after saturation of the inductance for any

value of the voltage greater than the minimum value, and in that said oscillating
circuit further includes a resistor (R1) having resistance that is equal to or in the

vicinity of the critical resistance of the oscillating circuit for the value of said
inductance (L) in the saturated state.
