<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a castor with a running wheel fork (34) which receives a running wheel (26) between its fork legs, having a blocking device on the trailing side in order to block the ability of the running wheel to rotate and the ability of the running wheel fork (34) to pivot, the said running wheel fork (34) being pivotable with its fork back about the axis of a kingpin by means of a steering roller bearing which runs perpendicularly to the axis of the running wheel and is held by the said kingpin, the locking device being in the form of a two-armed sprung or spring-loaded tilting lever (6) which is mounted on the fork back (4) so as to be tiltable over the running wheel, extends with a trailing-side tilting arm (28) above the running wheel and under a fork back extension which is arranged on the trailing side, with a roller bearing-side tilting arm above the running wheel as far as the steering roller bearing and can be tilted into a locked position counter to its spring by means of an expansion toggle which extends over the length of the said tilting lever (6) with a web through a longitudinal slot of the extension of the fork back and can be locked in the overdead-centre position of the expansion toggle (2), the tilting lever (6) engaging in the locking position at one end in a toothing (13) of the spherical disk of the steering roller bearing and resting over the length of the trailing-side tilting arm with a braking surface (20) on the tread of the running wheel, the expansion toggle resting with a toggle component with lower shoulders in counter bearing recesses at the end of the tilting arm and with upper shoulders on the fork back extension, being clamped in between the latter and the tilting lever and having above the fork back extension a release actuation tread surface and a locking actuation surface outside the lower shoulders, the tilting lever (16) having in the region of the braking surface a downwardly open, upwardly projecting, pot-shaped receptacle recess for a securing nut which receives a brake screw which widens on the running wheel side and is provided with the braking surface whilst the brake screw, lying under the hole in the release position of the tilting lever, is adjustable by means of the hole, the said invention being characterised in that the expansion toggle (2) is bent twice at its release actuating tread surface (21) with respect to the web (1) in such a way that the vertical distance between the upper edge of the expansion toggle and the upper edge of the roller housing corresponds in the locked position to the vertical distance between the upper edge of the locking actuation surface of the expansion toggle in the release position, and the bent web projects in the locked position beyond the outer final limiting edge of the fork back extension by a distance (4).

A castor having a wheel fork (34) which accommodates a wheel 
(26) between its fork limbs (25), a locking device on the trailing side 

for locking the rotational mobility of the wheel (26) and the pivotal 
mobility of the wheel fork (34) which is pivotable with its fork back 

portion (27) by means of a kingpin (32) extending perpendicularly to 
the axis of the wheel (26) and steering rolling bearings (33) held by 

the kingpin (32), about the axis of the kingpin (32), wherein the 
locking device in the form of a two-arm, resilient or spring-loaded 

rocking lever (6) which is mounted rockably above the wheel (26) on the 
fork back portion (27) and which extends with a rocking arm (28) at the 

trailing side above the wheel (26) and below a fork back portion 
extension (4) arranged at the trailing side and with a rocking arm (29) 

at the rolling bearing side above the wheel (26) to the steering 
rolling bearing (33) and by means of a spreading toggle (22) which 

extends over its length with a leg (1) through a longitudinal slot (3) 
in the fork back portion extension (4) is rockable against its spring 

action into a locking position and can be arrested in the over dead-centre 
position of the spreading toggle (2), wherein in the locking 

position the rocking lever (1) engages at one end into a tooth 
arrangement (13) of the ball disc of the steering rolling bearing (33) 

and on the length of the rocking arm (28) at the trailing side bears 
with a braking surface (20) against the running surface of the wheel 

(26) while the spreading toggle (2), bearing with a toggle portion with 
lower shoulders (17) in support recesses (22) at the end of the rocking 

arm (28) and with upper shoulders (18) against the fork back portion 
extension (4), is clamped between the latter and the rocking lever (6) 

and has above the fork back portion extension (4) a release actuation 
tread surface (21) and outside the lower shoulders a locking actuation 

surface (15), wherein in the region of the braking surface (20) the 
rocking lever (6) has a downwardly open, upwardly projecting, cup-shaped 

receiving recess (36) for a holding nut (35) which accommodates 
a braking screw (37) which is widened at the side towards the wheel and  

 
is provided with the braking surface (20) while the braking screw (37), 

in the release position of the rocking lever (6), disposed below the 
hole (39), is displaceable through the latter, characterised in that at 

its release actuation tread surface (21) the spreading toggle (2) is 
angled twice to form the leg (1) in such a way that the vertical 

spacing (V2) of the upper edge (30) of the spreading toggle (2) from 
the upper edge (5) of the castor housing in the locked position 

corresponds to the vertical spacing (V1) of the upper edge (31) of the 
locking actuation surface (15) of the spreading toggle (2) in the 

release position and the angled leg (1) in the locked position projects 
by a distance (H) beyond the outer end boundary edge (40) of the fork 

back portion extension (4). 
A castor according to claim 1 characterised in that in the 
locked position the rocking lever (6) engages with rocking lever tooth 

means (12) arranged at its end which is on the rocking arm (29) at the 
rolling bearing side into tooth means (13) of the ball disc (14) of the 

rolling bearing mounting (33), which tooth means (13) extend radially 
relative to the axis of the kingpin (32). 
A castor according to claim 1 characterised in that in its 
fixing region the rocking lever has a centrally arranged eye (7) with a 

through bore (41) for fixing to the fork back portion extension (4), 
wherein the eye (7) is connected to L-shaped side legs (9.1, 9.2) of 

the rocking lever (6) by way of connecting legs (8.1, 8.2) extending 
transversely relative to the longitudinal extent of the rocking lever 

(6). 
A castor according to claims 1 and 3 characterised in that the 
rocking lever (6) is fixed to the fork back portion extension (4) by 

way of a welded-on screwthreaded stud (10) and a nut (11). 
A castor according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
braking screw (16) has a ring of teeth (42) on the braking surface 

(20) and is adjustable through the hole (39) in the spreading toggle 
(2) and a further hole (43) in the rocking arm (28).
