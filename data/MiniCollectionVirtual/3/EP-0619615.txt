<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the deposition of II-VI 
semiconductor films, and, more particularly, to the deposition 
of ternary chalcogenide semiconductor films, such 
as HgCdTe and HgZnTe, onto silicon substrates. Ternary II-VI semiconductor films find use in many 
infra-red applications, such as in IR focal plane arrays 
(FPAs). Examples of such ternary II-VI semiconductor compounds 
include HgCdTe and HgZnTe, which are also known as 
chalcogenides. In the past, ternary II-VI semiconductors were formed 
on ternary II-VI substrates, such as CdZnTe, which were 
then bonded to silicon substrates by indium bump technology. 
However, the thermal cycling to 77K, which is the temperature 
used for detection, has tended to create reliability 
problems. It is desired to use silicon-based substrates 
rather than bulk CdZnTe substrates for large area 
focal plane arrays, since the read-out circuit chips are 
also silicon, and thus expansion and contraction with thermal 
cycling would be at the same rate. A variety of approaches have been tried to form II-VI 
films on silicon. Prior methods of depositing II-VI films 
on Si substrates fall into two categories: (1) those employing 
an intervening buffer layer, usually GaAs or a  
 
Group II fluoride such as CaF₂ or BaF₂, between the Si substrate 
and the II-VI layer; and (2) those that deposit the 
II-VI film directly on the Si substrate with no intentional 
placement of any intervening layers. However, for the most 
part, various buffer layers have been used, due to the disparity 
of lattice parameters between silicon and the II-VI 
semiconductor film, which often is of the order of 15% to 
20%. Group II fluoride buffer layers on silicon have been 
used, with the II-VI film formed on the buffer layer; see, 
e.g., A.N. Tiwari, et al., "Heteroepitaxy of CdTe(100) on 
Si(100) Using BaF₂-CaF₂(100) Buffer Layers", Journal of 
Crystal Growth, Vol. 111, pp. 730-735 (1991). However, 
this approach is presently substantially inferior in crystalline 
quality to II-VI films deposited either on GaAs/Si 
or silicon. Faurie and coworkers have deposited CdTe directly on 
silicon; see, e.g., R. Sporken, et al., "Current Status of 
Direct Growth of CdTe and HgCdTe on Silicon by Molecular 
Beam Epitaxy", Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology, B 
10 pp. 1405-1409 (1992). However, the {111} orientation 
employed in their work has often resulted in extensive domain 
and lamellar twin formation that renders the material 
unreliable for use as alternative substrates in liquid 
ph
