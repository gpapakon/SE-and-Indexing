<ABSTRACT>
A timbering device has large-surface timbering panels (2, 4) supported against pairs of opposite vertical stays (1, 3) spaced apart by at least one bracing frame (5). The stays (1, 3), whose cross-section is C-shaped, have legs (16, 16') that project from their side walls (15, 15'), are bent parallel to the base wall (12) and are oriented towards each other, leaving a large intermediate gap. The bracing frame (5) is vertically movable in the stays (1, 3). Rollers for transmitting compressive forces roll on the base wall (12) of the stays (1, 3) and rollers (17, 17') for transmitting the tensile forces of the bracing frame (5) roll on the inner side of both legs (16, 16') of a stay (1, 3). In order to reduce material and mounting expenditure, the rollers (11, 11') for transmitting compressive forces and the rollers (17, 17') for transmitting tensile forces are arranged on common axes (10). The rollers (11, 11') for transmitting compressive forces are arranged in the gap between the legs (16, 16') of a stay (1, 3) and their diameter is larger than the distance between these legs (16, 16') and the base wall (12). The rollers (17, 17') for transmitting tensile forces have a smaller diameter and are arranged at the outward sides of the rollers (11, 11') for transmitting compressive forces.

A sheeting device having large-size sheeting panels (2,4) arranged in 
pairs mutually facing each other supported against vertical supports (1,3) 

which are positioned in pairs mutually facing each other and which are held 
in spaced-apart relationship by at least one spreader frame (5), the side 

walls (15,15) of the supports (1,3) having legs (16,16') bent in parallel to 
the base wall, lying opposite to each other and leaving a broad gap between 

them, and the spreader frame (5) in the gaps of mutually opposing supports 
(1,3) being guided in a vertically movable manner with positive fit in the 

horizontal direction by means of rollers (11, 11') transmitting pressure 
forces of the spreader frame and running on the base wall (12) of the 

supports (1,3) and by means of rollers (17,17') transmitting traction forces 
of the spreader frame (5) and running on the inner sides of the two legs 

(16,16') of a support, 
characterized in
 that the pressure forces-transmitting 
rollers (11,11') and the traction forces-transmitting rollers (17, 17') are 

located on common axles (10), with the rollers (11,11') transmitting the 
pressure forces being located within the gap between the legs (16,16') of a 

support (1,3) and having a diameter that is larger than the distance of said 
legs (16,16') from the base wall (1 2), and the rollers (17,17') transmitting 

the traction forces having a smaller diameter and being located at the 
respective outwardly directed sides of the pressure forces-transmitting 

rollers (11, 11'). 
The sheeting device according to claim 1 
characterized in
 that one 
roller (11,11') transmitting pressure forces and one roller (17,17') transmitting 

traction forces are connected with each other so as to form a single 
piece.  

 
The sheeting device according to claim 1 or 2 
characterized in
 that both 
sides of the spreader frame (5) have two spaced-apart vertical walls (19, 

19') with the axles (10) inserted and welded thereto, the rollers (11,17 and 
11',17') being rotably mounted to their projecting ends. 
The sheeting panel according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterized 
in
 that the base wall (12) of a support (1,3) is about three times as wide as 
one side wall (1 5,1 5') of the support. 
The sheeting device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterized 
in
 that the supports (1,3) are attached to the inner sides of the sheeting 
panels (2,4) at both lateral edges of the sheeting panels (2,4). 
The sheeting device according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterized 
in
 that the vertical struts (8,9) of the spreader frame (5) are connected via 
an upper lengthwise adjustable brace (6) and a lower lengthwise adjustable 

brace (7) to form an inherently rigid frame (5). 
The sheeting device according to claim 6 
characterized in
 that consoles 
(23,24) for placing a beam thereon are located at the upper ends of the 

vertical struts (8,9) and the outer ends of the upper spreader (6). 
The sheeting device according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
characterized 
in
 that the axles (10) are located on a level with the upper and lower cross 
struts or spreaders (6,7).
