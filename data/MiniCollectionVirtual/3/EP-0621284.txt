<ABSTRACT>
Amino acid sequences which have a specificity as a lipoprotein(a) and are lowly homologous with LDL and plasminogen 
are selected from among the amino acid sequences of the lipoprotein(a) to obtain antibodies against the lipoprotein(a) which specifically 

recognize these amino acid sequences. At least one of these antibodies is used in the immunoassay of the lipoprotein(a). 
Amino acid sequences which have a specificity as an apolipoprotein(a) and do not have antigenicities as the lipoprotein(a) and 

plasminogen are selected from among the amino acid sequences of the apolipoprotein(a) to obtain antibodies against the apolipoprotein(a) 
which specifically recognize these amino acid sequences. At least one of these antibodies is used in the immunoassay 

of the apolipoprotein(a). The invention serves to prepare antibodies against lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein(a) more readily 
than the conventional methods and to conduct the immunoassay of the lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein(a) accurately by using 

the antibodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to peptides selected from 
apolipoprotein (a) that is a constituent of lipoprotein (a) 
being a risk factor involved in arteriosclerosis and having 
clinical significance, immunogens for producing antibodies 
which recognize lipoprotein (a) or apolipoprotein (a) or 
peptides comprising constituent parts thereof, antibodies 
recognizing lipoprotein (a) or apolipoprotein (a) or peptides 
comprising constituent parts thereof, and methods for the 
determination of lipoprotein (a) or apolipoprotein (a) using 
these antibodies. Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] was first reported in 1963 by Berg 
as a variant of Î²-lipoprotein [K. Berg, Acta Pathol. 
Microbiol. Scand., 59, 369-382(1963)]. As a result of 
subsequent various investigations, it has been found that 
lipoprotein (a) is a substance consisting of low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) which usually plays a major role in 
transporting cholesterol esters within the living body, and of  
 
apolipoprotein (a) [apo (a)] which is a protein peculiar to 
lipoprotein (a), the protein moiety of LDL (i.e., 
apolipoprotein B-100) and apolipoprotein (a) being linked to 
each other by a disulfide bond (see Fig. 36). Apolipoprotein (a) comprises at most 37 portions having 
high homology with a structure, called Kringle 4, of plasminogen, 
a portion having high homology with the Kringle 5 structure 
of plasminogen, and a serine protease structure portion with a 
region having high homology with plasminogen. Of these 37 
Kringle portions, 28 have a completely repeating structure. Moreover, it has been reported that various isotypes 
(phenotypes) of lipoprotein (a) exist [G. Utermann et al., J. 
Clin. Invest., 80, 458-465(1987); H.G. Kraft et al., 
Arteriosclerosis, 8, 212-216(1988); G. Utermann et al., Hum. 
Genet., 78, 41-46(1988)]. This is considered to be due to 
differences in the number of repetition of the Kringle 4-corresponding 
portion of apolipoprotein (a) [V.N. Trieu et 
al., J. Biol. Chem., 266, 5480-5485(1991)]. As a result of 
fractionation by a combination of SDS electrophoresis and an 
immunological blot technique, F, B, S1, S2, S3, S4 and O 
isotypes have been detected [G. Utermann et al., J. Clin. 
Invest., 80, 458-465(1987)]. Clinically, it has been found that the level of lipoprotein 
(a) is high in many patients with ischemic heart diseases such 
as angina pectoris and myocardial infarction [G. Dahlen et  
 
al., Acta Med. Scand., (Suppl.) 531, 1-29(1972); K. Berg et 
al., Clin. Genet., 16, 347-352(1979); G.M. Kostner et al.,
