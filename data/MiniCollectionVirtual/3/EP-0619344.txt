<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to acetal resin
compositions overcoming the disadvantages of formation of
excessive mold deposits and the smell of formaldehyde gas
during mold processing and exhibiting excellent heat stability.Acetal resins have been widely used as engineering
resins in various fields, especially in electrical appliance
and electronics industries, for their excellent mechanical and
molding properties. Acetal resins, however, are easily
decomposed by heating during mold processing to generate
formaldehyde gas, which causes a deterioration of working
environment. Moreover, the generated formaldehyde and volatile
materials come from additives such as the stabilizer contained
in the acetal resin, which separates out on the surface of a
mold to form mold deposits. Since the mold deposits
considerably deteriorate the surface of the moldings and
decrease the accuracy in the dimension of the moldings, molds
have to be disassembled to remove the mold deposits from their
surface. This requires a great deal of labor and time so that
productivity is reduced. Thus reduction of mold deposits has
been strongly desired.For the purpose of solving the above problems, there
have been many proposals. Japanese Patent Publication No.
5440/1959 and U.S. Patent No. 3,960,984 disclose acetal resin 
compositions containing polyamide and amide oligomers,
respectively in order to reduce the amount of formaldehyde
produced by the thermal decomposition. Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 14859/1991 discloses an acetal resin
composition comprising antioxidants having a sterically
hindered phenolic structure, metal salts of carboxylic acids,
and quaternary polyamides 6/66/610/12. These acetal resin
compositions do not succeed in sufficiently controlling the bad
smell of formaldehyde and the formation of mold deposits during
the mold processing, Since the polyacetals are not stabilized
sufficiently.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 50948/1990
discloses an acetal resin composition comprising the
hydrotalcite as an ion adsorbent in order to improve molding
strain (warpage) and cycle rate. U.S. Patent No. 4,837,400
discloses acetal resin compositions containing hindered phenol
type antioxidants, alkaline earth metal silicates and/or
alkaline earth metal glycerophosphates whose heat stability is
improved. The inventions described in the Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open and U.S. Patent, however, do not aim at
reducing mold deposits so that the disclosed acetal resin
compositions do not show the effects of
