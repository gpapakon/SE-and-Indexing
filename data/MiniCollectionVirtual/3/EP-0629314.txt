<DESCRIPTION>
 LIGHTWEIGHT STOWABLE AND DEPLOYABLE SOLAR CELL ARRAY Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a solar cell array which is light of weight, provides a substantial area for exposure to the sun, and is stowable in a small space. Background of the InventionSolar cell arrays comprise an underlying structure for supporting a substantial number of individual cells, plus the cells. The cells themselves are rigid plate-like structures. In previously known arrays they are usually mounted to a rigid panel. For fixed installations the frame itself is entirely rigid. For arrays on spacecraft it is customary to adapt the panels for stowage by means such as hinges which will permit the panels to be folded against each other to reduce the dimensions of the array to a stowable configuration. All of this involves items such as hinges and actuating means such as cables, which must not fail lest the array be rendered useless. They are costly, and involve weight which should be minimized. It is an object of this invention to provide a solar cell array whose stowage and deployment are accomplished by rotational movement of spars around a central hub. Gores which extend radially between the spars are opened or folded as a consequence of this rotary motion to deploy or to stow the array.It is an optional object of this invention to apply power only at the hub, to deploy or to stow the array whereby to provide for lightness of weight, reliability, and economy of the array. It is yet another optional object of this invention to provide a substrate which can be folded, thereby to eliminate the need for a rigid supporting frame. Brief Description of the InventionA solar cell array according to this invention is supported by a static panel. Mounting means for the array is provided by a drive gimbal or other means which provides support, and usually also provides rotational movement to the static panel so the array can be directed toward the sun. 

 The axle of a hub is rigidly fixed to the static panel. A hub rotor is rotatably fitted to the axis, the hub comprising the axle and the rotor, and having an axis of rotation normal to the static panel (root spar) . A pivot panel is rigidly mounted to the rotor, and extends radially from it. A plurality of intermediate spars are mounted to the hub for free rotation relative to the hub. They also extend radially from the hub.A gore is attached at its radial edges between each pair of spars, but not between the static panel and the pivot panel, which are not interconnected. The

CLAIMS
1. A solar cell array comprising: a static root spar, a lead spar, and a plurality of intermediate spars, a hub comprising an axle and a rotor mounted on and rotatable around said axle, said hub having an axis of rotation; drive means for rotating said rotor around said axle; said root spar being fixed to said axle, and said lead spar being fixed to said rotor, and said intermediate spars being mounted to said hub for free rotation around its axis of rotation, said spars extending radially from said hub; a gore between and interconnecting each adjacent pair of spars, except between said root spar and lead spar, each said gore being foldable along a mid-gore flexure which extends radially midway between its respective spars; and solar cells mounted to said gores on each side of the flexures; whereby deployment is accomplished by rotating the hub and lead spar to open the gores, and stowage is accomplished by reverse rotation of the hub and lead spar.
2. A solar cell array according to claim 1 in which said spars are deflected from a plane which is normal to the axis of rotation of the hub whereby to form a cupped array structure when deployed.
3. A solar cell array according to claim 1 in which said gores are made of an open-scrim cloth.
4. A solar cell array according to claim 1 in which said gores comprise an open-scrim, Leno-woven cloth of glass or quartz fibers, the fibers being coated with a low- outgassing atomic oxygen-insensitive silicon adhesive, said adhesive covering the woven structure, but not occluding the openings in the scrim.
5. A solar cell array according to claim 4 in which said spars are deflected from a plane which is normal 


 Î´ to the axis of rotation of the hub whereby to form a cupped array structure when deployed.
6. A solar cell array according to claim 1 in which a plate is hingedly connected to said gimbal, having an area so disposed and arranged that the stowed array bears against it.
7. A solar cell array according to claim 1 in which the stowed gores are compressed between the static panel and the pivot panel by two sheets of polyimide foam to distribute compressive forces.
