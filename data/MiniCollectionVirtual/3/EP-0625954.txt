<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for controlled feeding of particulate, flowing substance. The device consists of an outflow part (1) of a vessel containing the substance to be fed and a proportioning disk (4) rotated underneath its mouth opening at an operational clearance, a flow guiding structure (12) formed at the mouth opening of the outflow part (1) and opening spirally in the rotation direction of the proportioning disk (4) and forming an out flow opening (8), and a doctor blade (5) mounted away from the outflow opening (8) in the rotation direction of the disk for the purpose of removing the material from the disk. The diameter of the mouth opening of the outflow part (1) is no more than approximately half of the diameter of the proportioning disk (4), and the doctor blade (5) is placed at a distance of at least approximately half a rotation away from the outflow opening (8) in the rotation direction of the proportioning disk (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a disk feeder according to the preamble 
of claim 1 by means of which 
particulate, flowing material can be fed in a controlled 
manner through a mouth opening in a bottom cone of a 
vessel containing the material. The term controlled feeding 
is used in this connection to include both continuous 
feeding and intermittent feeding, and so that the term 
proportioning can also be used when referring to either 
of these functions. As a feeding device the equipment 
includes a rotating disc placed underneath the mouth 
opening in the bottom cone, which disk feeds the material 
flowing through the opening to an appropriate receiving 
device for further conductance. In order to regulate the 
amount of the material to be fed, the rotation speed of 
the disc can be adjusted and the device includes control 
and regulation elements functioning in conjunction with a 
flow opening formed at the mouth opening. The material 
guided onto the disk trough the mouth opening in the bottom 
cone is removed from the disk by a doctor blade placed 
downstream of the flow opening in the rotation direction 
of the disk. The devices of the aforementioned kind are as their basic 
construction prior known (see for example US-A-3 261 514), 
and they can be considered to 
function properly in the proportioning of several kinds 
of flowing substances. However, when the said known art 
devices are used in controlled feeding, i.e. for proportioning 
substances which are difficult to handle, essential 
problems arise. There are basically two types of the 
aforementioned substances which are difficult to handle, 
namely those that flow with difficulty and those that 
flow too readily. Substances that flow with difficulty 
tend to come out of the flow opening unevenly, at times 
abundantly and at other times the flow may be interrupted. 
When handling readily-flowing substances, on the 
other hand, it is difficult to achieve a self blocking 
effect of the material flow when applying the intermittent  
 
proportioning; i.e. although the proportioning disk 
is at standstill, the substance tends to flow out of the 
flow opening and further over the proportioning disk to a 
discharge opening. In accordance with the invention, the problems associated 
with these known art devices have been eliminated by dimensioning 
the diameter of the mouth opening of the out-flow 
part to be approximately half of the diameter of the 
proportioning disk and by placing the doctor blade in the 
direction of rotation of the
