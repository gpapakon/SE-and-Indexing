<ABSTRACT>
A transmisson device for transmitting a wanted signal (NS) modulated on a carrier (TS) has a band filter connected in the transmission path (2) of the transmission device (1) and tuned with the frequency (F(T)) of the carrier. An error signal circuit (9) influences the band filter, recognizing oscillations generated at the band filter whose amplitude remains below a set limit value (SW) set in the error signal circuit, and generating an error frequency signal (FS) representative of the frequency of occurrence of the recognized oscillation errors. A quality adjusting circuit (7) which adjusts the quality (G) of the band filter is connected to the band filter (5) and the error frequency signal (FS) is supplied to its adjusting input. When the error frequency signal is missing, a first filtering quality (GO) is adjusted at the band filter on the basis of a quality conversion characteristic (10), setting a band width (Bf18) at the band filter at least equal to the predetermined transmission band width for the wanted signal (NS) to be transmitted. When an upper value (FSn) of the error signal (FS) is generated for a determined error rate yet to be regulated, a second filtering quality (GM) is adjusted at the band filter on the basis of the same quality conversion characteristic (10), setting a determined voltage magnification of the carrier oscillation (TS) at the output of the band filter.

Circuit arrangement for equalizing information of a
useful signal (NS), which is modulated on a carrier (TS)

without unilateral sideband reduction and which, as a
result of the transmission, is received distorted by a

receiver, said circuit arrangement having a bandpass
filter (5) tuned to the carrier frequency (f(T)), which

is connected upstream of a demodulator (6) of the
receiver, and having an error signal circuit (9)

influencing the bandpass filter, which detects the
oscillations at the bandpass filter, whose amplitude

remains below a threshold value (SW) set in the error
signal circuit, and generates an error rate signal (FS)

corresponding to the frequency of the detected error
oscillations, 
characterised in that
 a Q-setting circuit
(7) for the Q (G) of the filter is connected to the

bandpass filter (5), to whose control input the error
rate signal (FS) is fed, with a Q conversion

characteristic (10),

by which on the one hand a filter Q (GO) is set at
the bandpass filter in the absence of an error rate

signal, at which the filter bandwidth (Bf18) is at
least equal to the transmission bandwidth of the

received useful signal (NS),
and by which on the other hand, for an upper value
(FSn) of the error signal (FS) generated for an

error rate still capable of being corrected, a
filter Q (Gm) is set at the bandpass filter, at

which the carrier (TS) exhibits a voltage rise at
the output of the bandpass filter.
Transmission arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the voltage rise of the carrier
(TS) at the output of the bandpass filter (5) is at least

30 dB at the upper value (Gm) of the error rate signal

Transmission arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the adjustable Q-setting circuit
(7) is an electronically variable resistance circuit

which is connected as a damping resistor to the bandpass
filter (5) and whose resistance value can be varied by

the signal value of the error rate signal fed to the
control input of the resistance circuit.

 the resistance circuit is an
antiparallel diode circuit (29) that can be adjusted at

its control output (17) by the error rate signal (FS).
Transmission arrangement according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the resistance circuit is a field-effect
transistor circuit (70) in which the source-drain

junction (34) of the field-effect transistor (35) is
connected as a leakage resistor whose resistance value

can be adjusted by the signal value of an error rate
signal (FS) fed to the control input of the field-effect

transistor circuit.
Transmission arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the adjustable Q-setting circuit
(7) is an electronically variable feedback circuit that

is connected between the output and the input of the
bandpass filter (5), and whose feedback factor can be

adjusted by the signal value of an error rate signal (FS)
fed to a control input of the feedback circuit.
