<ABSTRACT>
The acetabular cup (2) comprises a metal outer shell (4), a plastic intermediate shell (5) and a metal inner shell (6) which can be positively inserted into the intermediate shell. The outer shell (4) is divided up into segments (4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e) by slots (9) which are open towards its equatorial edge region. The outer shell (4) and the inner shell (6) are rigidly supported relative to one another via an attachment part (8) in the direction of a common principal axis (A) and connected so as to be fixed against rotation via a fastening element (15) eccentrically offset relative to this principal axis (A). The intermediate shell (5) is designed with a passage opening (20) receiving the attachment part (8) and with an outer surface (21) which has a support part (21a) intended to rest against a part of the inner surface (18) of the outer shell (4) and delimits a play (S) outside this support part (21a) with the remaining part of the inner surface (18). This play permits corresponding relative movements of the intermediate shell (5) containing the inner shell (6) and at least one of the segments (4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e) of the outer shell (4) perpendicular to the principal axis (A). Upon loading, the implanted outer shell (4) can deform elastically with the bone part surrounding it, whereas the spherical shape of the inner shell (6) is retained.

A multi-part artificial acetabular cup, containing a metallic
outer shell (4), insertable into an implantation area and

anchorable in the bone tissue (1), having mobile segments
(4a,4b,4c,4d,4e) which are limited by meridian extending slits

(9), an intermediate shell (5) comprised of synthetic material,
insertable into outer shell (4), and a metallic inner shell (6)

which is form-lockingly insertable into same for incorporating
a joint head (3), whereby outer shell (4) and intermediate shell

(5) likewise intermediate shell (5) and inner shell (6) each co-operate
through an at least approximately hemispherical-shaped

inner or outer surface (18 or 21,22 or 25), characterised in that
segments (4a,4b,4c,4d,4e) constructed in outer shell (4) are

anchorable in the bone tissue by means of internal tension, that
outer shell (4) and inner shell (6) are rigidly and rotation-fast

connected to one another via at least one securing element
(15) in the direction of a common, at least approximately radial

main axis (A), and that outer surface (21) of intermediate shell
(5) has a support part (21a) intended for laying on a part of

inner surface (18), and beyond this support part (21), limits a
predetermined play (S) with the remaining part of inner surface

(1) of outer shell (4), which allows corresponding relative
movement of intermediate shell (5) containing inner shell (6) and

at least one of segments (4a,4b,4c,4d,4e) of implanted outer
shell (4) transversely to the common main axis (A).
An acetabular cup according to claim 1, characterised in that
outer surface (21) of intermediate shell (5) is arranged having

a radius (R4) which, corresponding to the predetermined play
(S) about a mass is smaller than the radius (R3) of inner surface

(18) of outer shell (4). 
An acetabular cup according to claims 1 or 2, characterised
in that outer shell (4) is provided with a number of projections

(7) arranged in the edge part area which are insertable in the
bone tissue (1) and spaced from outer surface (17), through which

segments (4a,4b,4c,4d,4e) are each anchorable in the implantation
area.
An acetabular cup according to any of the previous claims,
characterised in that outer shell (4) is provided with a wall

thickness which permits a flexible distortion for the primary
anchorage of segments (4a,4b,4c,4d,4e) in the bending area of

segments (4a,4b,4c,4d,4e).
An acetabular cup according to any of the previous claims,
characterised in that outer shell (4) has a wall thickness in the

pole area (17a) which is smaller than the wall thickness in the
equatorial edge area.
An acetabular cup according to any of the previous claims,
characterised in that outer surface (21) and inner surface (22)

of the intermediate shell (5) are arranged eccentrically to one
another.
An acetabular cup according to any of the previous claims,
characterised in that outer shell (4) is provided with an

inwardly spaced inset part (8) in the area of the common axis
(A), which has an inset surface (10,10') intended for combining

with inner shell (6), and an inwardly opening guide bore (11),
that intermediate shell (5) is provided with a through orifice

(20) intended to incorporate inset part (8), and that inner shell
(6) is provided with a support surface (13,25') which can be laid

on the inset surface (10,10') of inset part (8) and a peg-like
guide part (14) which is outwardly spaced from this and which is

insertable into guide bore (11) of inset part (8). 
An acetabular cup according to claim 7, characterised in that
the securing element joining outer shell (4) and inner shell (5)

is provided in the form of a guide part (14) or centring pin
(15) arranged on the outer shell (4), eccentrically displaced

with regard to the common main axis (A), and that on each other
part, outer shell (4) or guide part (14), a correspondingly

arranged recess (16) is provided to incorporate centring pin
(15,26).
An acetabular cup according to any of the previous claims,
characterised in that the common main axis (A) of outer shell (4)

and inner shell (6) essentially corresponds to the line of action
of a main load force (B) to be transferred through the implanted

acetabular cup.
A hip joint prosthesis with an acetabular cup according to
any of claims 1-9.
