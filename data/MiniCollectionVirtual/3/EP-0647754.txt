<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle door latch (10) has a fork-bolt 
lever (30) that is latched by a detent lever (32). 

The detent lever (32) is operated by an intermittent 
lever (34) that is operated by a transfer lever (44) 

that is actuated by inside and outside door handles 
via operating levers. The door latch (10) includes a 

locking lever (40,41) that disconnects the door 
handles from the intermittent lever (34) when the 

locking lever is in a locked position. The door latch 
(10) also includes an anti-theft feature in the form 

of an electrically actuated "dead-bolt" lock (105) 
that is engaged and disengaged sol
ely by a key lock 
cylinder (95). The door latch (10) further includes 

an override feature (82,97,99,101,103) that unlocks 
the door latch (10) mechanically in the event of 

electrical power failure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle door
latches, and more particularly, to a vehicle door
latch that has an anti-theft feature.Automotive vehicles have a door latch on
each vehicle door to latch the door in the closed
position. Each vehicle door latch includes a lock
that is commonly actuated from inside the vehicle by a
readily accessible sill button or other
manually-operable device on the door. The vehicle
door lock for the front doors is conventionally
operated from outside the vehicle as well, usually by
a key lock cylinder that has a removable key to deter
theft.Upscale automotive vehicles commonly employ
a power-lock system as a convenience feature. The
power-lock system commonly employs an
electrically-powered actuator associated with each
door latch (and sometimes also with a trunk latch and
a fuel-filler door latch) to move the door lock
between its locked and unlocked positions. The
actuators are controlled in a variety of ways. In a
central vehicle door lock system, or at least in the
American version of such a system, all the actuators
are controlled by any one of three switches. These
three switches are located in the key lock cylinder
for the driver's door and on the interior trim panel
for each front door. Thus, all doors can be locked or
unlocked from outside the vehicle by means of the key
lock cylinder switch in the driver's door, or from
inside the vehicle by means of the switches next to
the driver or the front seat passenger.Manual and power door lock systems have a
common problem. As indicated above, the front door 
locks are commonly actuated from outside the vehicle
by a key lock cylinder that has a removable key to
deter theft. In four-door vehicles, the rear door
locks cannot be unlocked from outside the vehicle.
However, the door lock for any door is commonly
actuated from inside the vehicle by a readily
accessible sill button or other manually-operable
device that does not have any theft-deterrent feature.
Consequently, the theft-deterrent aspect of the
key-operated door lock can be circumvented by breaking
a vehicle window, reaching inside the vehicle and
unlocking the vehicle door by means of one of the
inside sill buttons or its equivalent.To overcome this circumvention technique, an
anti-theft feature has been developed for vehicle door
latches as a counter-measure in the case of
electrically-operated door latches used in central
locking or power door lock systems. See, for
instance, US Patents 4,342,209 granted to Frank
Kleefeldt August 3, 1982; 4,364,249 granted to

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle door latch (10) having an anti-theft means (105)
that disables an inside lock operator (56), said latch (10) comprising a fork-bolt

(30) that is movable between a latched position and an unlatched position; a
detent (32) that is movable between a detent position holding the fork-bolt (30)

in a latched position and a release position where the detent (32) is disengaged
from the fork-bolt (30); a latch mechanism (34,44) operatively connected to the

detent (32) for moving the detent from the detent position to the release
position; a locking member (40) that is movable between an unlock position

enabling the latch mechanism (34,44) to move the detent (32) from the detent
position to the release position and a lock position disabling the latch

mechanism (34,44) so that the latch mechanism cannot move the detent (32)
from the detent position to the release position, the locking member (40)

forming a first locking part of a multi-part locking member which has a second
locking part (41) that is releasably coupled to the first locking part (40); a first

operating member (89,91) connected to the multi-part locking member (40,41)
for moving the second locking part (41) and the first locking part (40) between

the unlock position and the lock position; and a second operating member
(82,93) connected to the first locking part (40) for moving the first locking part

(40) between the lock position and the unlock position; wherein the anti-theft
means (105) locks the second locking part (41) so that the first locking part (40)

cannot be moved from a locked position to an unlocked position by the first
operating member (89,91) but can be moved from a locked position to an

unlocked position by the second operating member (82,93) to provide an
override feature that unlocks the vehicle door latch (10) when the anti-theft

means (105) is engaged; characterised in that the first and second parts (40,41)
of the multi-part locking member are coupled together by a releasable detent

(97,99,101,103); and in that the first and second parts (40,41) of the locking
member are coupled by a lost-motion connection (83,88) that limits the relative

angular displacement of the parts (40,41) with respect to each other. 
A vehicle door latch (10) according to claim 1, in which the
second locking part (41) is releasably coupled to the first locking part (40) by a

spring-biased detent comprising a knob (97) on an integral leaf spring (99) of
one locking part and pockets (101,103) for receiving the knob (97) in the other

locking part.
A vehicle door latch (10) according to claim 1 or claim 2, in
which the lost-motion connection (83,88) comprises a projection (88) in one

part that is disposed in a slot (83) of the other part.
A vehicle door latch (10) according to claim 3, in which the
projection (88) is on the first locking part (40) and the projection (88) is

engaged by the second operating member (82,93) for moving the first part (40)
between the lock position and the unlock position.
