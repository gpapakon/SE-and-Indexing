<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for testing a static RAM includes a 
word line voltage control circuit (42) and an array supply voltage 

control circuit (46). In response to receiving a first control signal 
from a tester, the word line voltage control circuit (42) is used to 

provide a word line voltage to each word line of the memory array 
(31). The array supply voltage control circuit (46) provides a 

supply voltage to the array (31) in response to receiving a second 
control signal from the tester. During testing of memory 30, the 

array supply voltage and the word line voltage are supplied 
independently of the memory power supply voltage V
DD
 in order to 
quickly detect memory cells that are defective due to soft defects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to integrated circuit memories and
more particularly to a method and apparatus for testing a static
random access memory (SRAM).Static random access memories (SRAMs) are generally used
in applications requiring high speed, such as a cache memory in a
data processing system. A SRAM is usually implemented as an
array of memory cells organized in rows and columns. Each SRAM
cell stores one bit of data and is implemented as a pair of
inverters having their inputs and outputs cross-coupled at
differential storage nodes. The SRAM cell is "bistable", that is, it
is stable at one of two possible logic levels. The logic state of the
cell is determined by whichever of the two inverter outputs is a
logic high, and can be made to change states by applying a voltage
of sufficient magnitude and duration to the appropriate cell input.FIG. 1 illustrates in schematic diagram form, four transistor
memory cell 10 in accordance with the prior art. Four transistor
memory cell 10 includes polysilicon load resistors 11 and 12, and
N-channel transistors 13 - 16. Resistor 11 has a first terminal
connected to a power supply voltage terminal labeled "VDD", and a
second terminal. Resistor 12 has a first terminal connected to
VDD, and a second terminal. N-channel transistor 13 has a drain
connected to the second terminal of resistor 11 at storage node
101, a gate connected to the second terminal of resistor 12, and a
source connected to a power supply voltage terminal labeled "VSS".
N-channel transistor 14 has a drain connected to the second
terminal of resistor 12 and storage node 102, a gate connected to
the second terminal of resistor 11, and a source connected to VSS.
N-channel transistor 15 has a first drain/source terminal
connected to a bit line labeled "BL", a second drain/source terminal 
connected to the second terminal of resistor 11 at storage node
101, and a gate connected to a word line labeled "WL". N-channel
transistor 16 has a first drain/source terminal connected to a bit
line labeled "BL*", a second drain/source terminal connected to the
second terminal of resistor 12 at storage node 102, and a gate
connected to word line WL. (Note that an asterisk "*" after a signal
or line name indicates that the signal or line is a logical
complement of a signal or line having the same name but lacking
the asterisk "*".)To write a data bit into cell 10, word line WL is provided
with a logic high voltage, causing coupling transistors 15 and 16 to
be conductive. A logic high voltage is typically
