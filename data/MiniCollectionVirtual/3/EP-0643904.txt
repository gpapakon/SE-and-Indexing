<ABSTRACT>
Device for removing and cutting foliage such as potato 
foliage, said device comprising a frame (1) that can be 

fastened to a tractor and rests on the ground by means of 
wheels (4). The frame (1) contains a rotor (6) having its axis 

of rotation (5) extending almost horizontally and square to 
the driving direction of the tractor during operation and 

said rotor (6) being driveable through the power take-off of the 
tractor and being provided with a number of pivotably mounted 

clappers (7). A more or less semicircular cover (8) is 
connected to the frame (1), and within the cover (8) and at 

some distance thereof, a mat (9) of flexible material, such 
as rubber, is mounted under tension. The tension of the mat (9) 

can be adjusted through the fact that one end (11) thereof 
is connected to a pivotably arranged, lockable shaft (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for removing and 
cutting foliage, such as potato foliage, said device comprising 
a frame that can be fastened to a tractor and rests 
on the ground by means of wheels, said frame containing a 
rotor having its axis of rotation extending almost horizontally 
and square to the driving direction of the tractor 
during operation and said rotor being driveable through the 
power take-off of the tractor and being provided with a 
number of pivotably mounted clappers, a more or less semicircular 
cover being connected to the frame. Such a device is used e.g. in order to facilitate 
harvesting potatoes, through the fact that first the foliage 
is removed therefrom. Here, the cover serves to direct the cut foliage to the 
rotor back side, where it is discharged by special provisions 
in the grooves between the beds. The cover also serves 
for receiving objects flung away by the rotor, such as 
stones, so that they do not present any danger to the surroundings. The air vortex generated by the rotor rotating at high 
speed results in the fact that especially under dry circumstances, 
soil particles are carried along with the foliage. 
Since the cover is mostly wet due to the juice being beaten 
from the foliage, a considerable amount of the soil particles 
and shreds of cut foliage carried along will adhere to 
the inner circumference of the cover. This process continues until the layer of soil and 
foliage particles is so thick, that the clappers contact the 
layer. This results in wear of the clappers and additional 
energy consumption. Moreover, the weight of the layer of 
soil and foliage particles is regarded as an inconvenience. The object of the invention is to remove this difficulty 
and to that end provides for that a mat of flexible 
material is mounted under tension within the cover, in such 
a way that the mat is at some distance from the cover, but 
can not contact the rotor clappers.  Such a mat can be made of rubber, for example, and 
preferably means will be provided by which the tension of 
the mat can be adjusted. These means can be formed through the fact that the end 
of the mat being parallel to the rotor axis is fixedly 
connected to the cover or to the frame carrying the cover, 
whereas the other end is connected to a shaft being rotatably 
supported by the cover or the frame and being provided 
with locking members by which the shaft can be locked in its 
position. In this way, mounting of the mat is facilitated, and it 
can be brought under the proper

<CLAIMS>
Device for removing and cutting foliage, such as 
potato foliage, said device comprising a frame (1) that can 

be fastened to a tractor and rests on the ground by means of 
wheels (4), said frame containing a rotor (6) having its 

axis of rotation (5) extending almost horizontally and 
square to the driving direction of the tractor during operation 

and said rotor being driveable through the power take-off 
of the tractor and being provided with a number of 

pivotably mounted clappers (7), a more or less semicircular 
cover (8) being connected to the frame (1), characterized in 

that a mat (9) of flexible material is mounted under tension 
within the cover (8), in such a way that the mat (9) is at 

some distance from the cover (8), but can not contact the 
clappers (7) of the rotor (6). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
means (12) have been provided, by which the tension of the 

mat (9) can be adjusted. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the means are formed by the fact that one end (10) of the 

mat (9) being parallel to the axis of the rotor (6) is 
fixedly connected to the cover (8) or to the frame (1) 

carrying the cover, whereas the other end (11) is connected 
to a shaft (12) being rotatably supported by the cover (8) 

or the frame (1) and is provided with locking members by 
which the shaft (12) can be locked in its position. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that between both of its ends, the mat (9) 

is supported by one or more supporting bars (13) being 
parallel to the end edges (10, 11) of the mat (9) and pushing 

the mat outwardly in relation to the rotor (6).
