Articulation for motor vehicle seats comprising two flanges 
(2, 3) enclosing an inner mechanism which can be "continuous 

or "discontinuous" and a closing lid (8), one (3) of 
the flange (2, 3) being circular, characterized in that the 

other flange (2) is elongated by a radial extension (2c), the 
closing lid (8) having a periphery with curved over tabs (9) 

that fit on the half circumference placed on the extended 
side of said elongated flange (2), said elongated flange 

having said half circumference provided with cut-outs (10) 
for enabling passage of the tabs. 
Articulation according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the extension (2c) of the flange (2) comprises protrusions 

(6) facilitating fixation of this flange, while the circular 
flange (3) comprises a set of bosses (7) placed at 120Â° with 

respect to one another for enabling its fixation. 
Articulation according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the extension (2c) of the flange (2) is pierced with a 

hole (11) enabling the positionning of this articulation on 
the sitting portion or on the backing portion of a seat.
