<ABSTRACT>
A laminated environmental protective layer for 
acrylic aircraft windows provides significant improvement 

in the performance of original production windows and in 
repair of damaged aircraft windows. A thin chemical and 

erosion resistant outer protective layer (30) of environment 
resistant transparent material is laminated to the 

exterior acrylic surface of the aircraft window using a 
thin urethane interlayer (32). Use of chemically strengthened 

glass for the outer protective layer and hot processing of 
the laminate increases impact resistance. Addition of 

inner balancing layers (31,33) minimizes bowing of the processed 
window and enhances stiffness of the window and 

compression of the outer layer for additional impact 
resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is a continuation-in-part 
of U.S. patent application serial no. 08/157,954 filed 
on November 24, 1993 entitled Laminated Environmental 
Protection Layer for Acrylic Aircraft Windows. The present invention relates to laminated glass 
face ply assemblies incorporating integral heating 
elements for aircraft windshields. More particularly, 
the present invention provides an outer protective 
laminate af thin chemically strengthened glass, or 
highly cross-linked acrylic plies laminated to the 
acrylic surface of the aircraft windshield structural 
layer by a thin urethane interlayer. The outer 
protective laminate incorporates multiple thin glass 
layers with thin urethane or other adhesive interlayers 
configured to incorporate braids or leads for an 
electrical anti-ice element without structural 
degradation. Aircraft windows and windshields are typically 
fabricated using acrylic plastics in homogenous or  
 
laminated form or acrylic and glass laminated structures 
to meet weight and impact resistance requirements. In 
many of these window configurations, the external layer 
or surface comprises stretched acrylic plastic. 
Stretched acrylic provides a tough, reasonably durable 
finish, however, crazing, pitting, erosion and 
discoloration of the acrylic surface can be caused by 
particulates, hail and chemical attack. The toughness 
gained in stretching the acrylic reduces surface 
hardness thereby increasing the susceptibility to 
degradation. Windshield laminates typically comprise one or more 
structural layers of glass, stretched acrylic, 
polycarbonate or other light weight plastic over which 
a glass face ply of approximately .125 inches minimum is 
laminated. A polyvinyl butyryl (PVB) or other adhesive 
interlayer or approximately 0.10 to 0.15 inches is 
employed. In more complex windshields the outer glass 
face ply is heated using an electrical element for anti-icing. 
The anti-ice element is applied to the inner 
surface of the face ply and conductive braid or other 
conductor is provided for supplying electrical power to 
the anti-ice element. The braid is typically 
accommodated within the interlayer thickness thereby 
avoiding any structural impact to the laminated 
windshield. In recent years a worsening problem with aircraft 
windows has been created by significant volcanic 
eruptions which not only introduce significant 
quantities of high particulate ash into the upper 
atmosphere but also create a corrosive chemical 
environment severely degrading acrylic
