<ABSTRACT>
Filter candles (2) serve for filtering dust-laden, in particular hot, gases, which filter candles are arranged in a closed housing (1) which has a dirty gas space and a clean gas space and are composed of a porous hollow body (9) which has at least one outlet orifice and is otherwise closed, the outlet orifice of which is connected to the clean gas space. The end surface (11) surrounding the outlet orifice of the filter candle (2) is designed as a preferably convexly dished supporting surface and lies on an angular intermediate piece (16), the linear thermal expansion coefficient of which substantially corresponds to that of the filter candle (2) and which has on the one side a contact surface (17) matched to the end surface (11) of the filter candle (2). The intermediate piece (16) lies on a receiving element (12) of the clean gas space. The intermediate piece (16) and the receiving element (12) have plane-parallel sealing surfaces (18, 19) facing each other, along which the receiving element (12) and the intermediate piece (16) can slide horizontally one above the other.

Device for the filtering of dust-laden and in particular hot gases 
with the aid of substantially vertically oriented filter cartridges 

(2), which are arranged in a closed housing (1) displaying a raw gas 
chamber and a pure gas chamber and consist of a porous hollow body (9), 

which displays at least one exit opening at an end face and is closed 
for the remainder and the exit opening of which is connected with the 

pure gas chamber, wherein the end face surrounding the exit opening or 
that side wall (11) of the filter cartridge (2), which surrounds the 

exit opening, is formed as a preferably convexly curved bearing 
surface, a receptacle element (12) is provided for each filter 

cartridge at the partition between the raw gas chamber and the pure gas 
chamber, an annular intermediate member (16) is arranged between the 

receptacle element and that end face or side wall (11) of the filter 
cartridge (2), which is formed as bearing surface, and on the one side 

displays a contact surface (17), which is matched to the end face or 
side wall (11) of the filter cartridge (2), which is formed as bearing 

surface, and the mutually facing sides (18, 19) of the intermediate 
member (16) and of the receptacle element (12) are oriented 

horizontally, characterised thereby, that the linear thermal coefficient 
of expansion of the intermediate member (16) largely 

corresponds with that of the filter cartridge (2) and that the mutually 
facing sides of the intermediate member (16) and of the receptacle 

element (12) form planar parallel sealing surfaces (18, 19), along 
which the intermediate member (16) and of the receptacle element (12) 

are slidable one on the other. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
intermediate member (16) and of the receptacle element (12) are 

provided with vertical guides (20, 21), which stand one opposite the 
other, and that the spacing of the guides (20, 21) one from the other 

corresponds with at least the maximally occurring horizontal difference 
between the thermal expansions of the intermediate member (16) and of 

the receptacle element (12).
