<ABSTRACT>
In order to create a guiding device for lifts, in particular vertical lifts with guide rails 10 fastened to a shaft wall 2 by means of fastening members 12-14, which guiding device is insensitive to wall unevenness irrespective of the nature of the shaft wall and experiences no distortion during different thermal expansion of the guide rails 10 relative to the wall 2 or during settling of the housing and which is also suitable in particular for a rucksack lift, the guiding device is designed as a self-supporting, inherently rigid rail framework and has at least two parallel guide rails 10 which are rigidly connected to one another, and the fastening members 12-14 have springs 13, the rail framework 1 being connected to the shaft wall 2 via the springs 13.

Guide device for lifts, in particular vertical
lifts with guide rails (10, 11) fixed to a shaft

wall (2) by means of fixing elements (12-14),
characterised in that the guide device is designed

as a self-supporting, inherently rigid rail frame
(1) and has at least two parallel guide rails (10,

11), which are rigidly connected to one another,
and that the fixing elements (12-14; 34-36) have

springs (13; 35), the rail frame (1) being
connected to the shaft wall (2) by way of the

springs (13; 35).
Guide device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the fixing elements (12-14)

each have a wall-side fixing element (12) and a
rail-side fixing element (14) which are connected

to one another by the springs (13; 35).
Guide device according to one or both of the
preceding claims, characterised in that, per

fixing element, two springs designed as spring
clips (13
1
, 13
2
) are provided symmetrically to the 
rail longitudinal axis on both sides of the

respective guide rail (10, 11).
Guide device according to claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that each spring clip (13) is

designed as a spring bar bent off at right angles
at its rail-side end (21), which bar at the said

rail-side end (21) is pivotably articulated on the
rail-side fixing element (14) and at its other

wall-side end (22) is firmly connected to the
respective wall-side fixing element (12).
Guide device according to one or more of the
preceding claims 2 to 4, characterised in that

each rail-side fixing element (14) has a pivot
bearing (24), the articulated part (26) of which

is connected to a clamp (28), which is in turn
connected to the guide rail, and that the pivot

bearing also permits a slight swivelling of the
guide rail about an axis parallel to its

longitudinal axis.
Guide device according to one or more of the
preceding claims 2 to 5, characterised in that

each spring clip (13
1
, 13
2
) at its wall-side end
has a second approximately quadrant-shaped bend

(25) lying in a plane perpendicular to the first
right-angled bend of its rail-side end and 

pointing towards the guide rail (10, 11), and that
each wall-side fixing element (12) has an

adjusting element (27) in order to adjust and fix

the angle of each spring clip (13
1
, 13
2
) in
relation to the rail longitudinal axis and hence

the distance of each guide rail (10, 11) from the
wall.
Guide device according to one or both of
claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the fixing

elements (34, 36) are connected to one another by
a spring designed as spring bar (35).
Guide device according to claim 7,
characterised in that the spring bar (35) is

longitudinally displaceable and, by means of a
spherical joint (42) is pivotably supported in a

sleeve (39) of the rail-side fixing element (36).
Guide device according to one or both of the
preceding claims 7 to 8, characterised in that the

spring bar is pivotably supported in two opposing
bearings (40) of the wall-side fixing element

(34).
Guide device according to claim 9,
characterised in that the bearings (40) comprise a 

sheave (21) which can be swivelled easily and
which is arranged in a bearing housing (41).
Guide device according to one or more of the
preceding claims 7 to 10, characterised in that

the wall-side fixing element (34) is designed as
S-shaped clip, the wall-side end (38) of which can

be fixed in different angular positions by means
of a fixing member (42).
Guide device according to claim 11,
characterised in that the wall-side fixing element

(34) has a longitudinally adjustable support stay
(31) at a distance from its wall-side end (38).
Guide device according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that each guide

rail (10, 11) is designed with integral lift car
and counterweight running surface, additional

guard rail and flanges for the attachment of rail
butt joint connectors, preferably in the form of

an aluminium hollow profile section with internal
stiffening ribs (18).
Guide device according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the

parallel guide rails (10, 11) of the rail frame
(1) are rigidly connected by a base carrier (9) at 

the lower end and by an upper suspension
carrier (7) at the upper end.
Guide device according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the

parallel guide rails (10, 11) of the rail frame
(1) are also rigidly connected to one another by

crossbeams (5) provided at defined intervals from
one another.
Guide device according to claim 14 or 15,
characterised in that the base carrier (9) has at

least one drive pulley (8) and the upper
suspension carrier (7) at least one deflection

pulley (6).
Guide device according to one or more of
preceding claims 14 to 16, characterised in that

the base carrier (9) is supported on the shaft
floor (3).
Use of the guide device according to one or
more of claims 1 to 17 for the guiding of a
