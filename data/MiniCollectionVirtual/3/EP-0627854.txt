<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus having a recording and reproducing unit for 
recording and reproducing an encoded video signal received 

from a transmitter comprises a first, a second and a third 
recording paths through which the encoded video signal is 

processed in a first recording mode, a second recording mode 
and a third recording mode in order to selectively record the 

processed video signal; and a fourth, a fifth and a sixth 
reproduction paths through which the video signal recorded in 

the first, the second or the third recording mode is retrieved 
by the recording and reproducing unit and processed for the 

displaying thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
recording and reproducing a digital video signal; and, more
particularly, to an apparatus for recording and reproducing
video signals through the respective selected paths from a
plurality of recording paths and reproducing paths.As is well known, a digital video tape recorder ("VTR")
records and reproduces a video signal in a digital form. The
digital video signal may be a pulse code modulated ("PCM")
signal which is obtained by performing a sampling operation on
the video signal in such a manner that satisfies the so-called
Nyquist condition. The digital VTR of the type described
above is disclosed in an article entitled "Digital Video
Recording Techniques Using 1/2" Metal Particle Tape" by S.
Mita et al., IEEE Consumer Electronics, pages 386-397 (August,
1985).In a digital video transmission system, the digital video
signal can be processed by using a conventional encoding 
system to produce a compressed video signal. The conventional
encoding system may employ various video compression
techniques for the transmission of digital video signals
through a conventional communication channel. The compressed
digital video signal, transmitted to a receiving end, may be
directly applied to the digital VTR for its recording, or may
be processed through a decoding system to produce, e.g., a PCM
signal for the recording thereof.JP-A-4-068 884 (ARAI et al.) discloses a digital magnetic
recording and reproducing device. This device is able to
process three different types of input video signals, namely
standard analog, standard digital and high-speed digital
video signals. The device records the different types of
video signals in the same format on a magnetic tape, thereby
using different recording modes for each types of video
signal. The recording patterns on the magnetic tape are
identical to each other in either case, the recording mode
being the standard-speed (analog or digital) or the high-speed
(digital) mode.The disclosed device comprises a recording and reproducing
unit for recording and reproducing a video signal received
from a transmitter, which includes first, second and third
means for passing and processing the video signal, an input
selector for selectively providing the video signal from
the first, second or third means to the recording and reproducing
unit, and fourth, fifth and sixth means for passing
and processing the video signal distributed thereto
for the reproduction thereof. Depending on the type of
input signal, the input selector

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus having a recording and reproducing unit
for recording and reproducing an encoded digital video signal

received from a transmitter, which comprises:

a first means for passing the encoded video signal for
the recording thereof in a first recording mode;
a second means for processing the encoded video signal to
produce a decoded video signal for the recording thereof in a

second recording mode;
a third means for processing the encoded video signal to
produce an intra-mode compressed video signal for the

recording thereof in a third recording mode;
an input selector for selectively providing the video
signal from the first, the second or the third means to the

recording and reproducing unit for the recording and
reproducing thereof in the first, the second or the third

recording mode;
a recording mode detection and distribution unit, when
the video signal is reproduced by the recording and

reproducing unit, for detecting the recording mode of the
video signal and distributing the video signal in accordance

with the detected recording mode;
a fourth means for processing the video signal
distributed thereto for the reproduction thereof, wherein the

video signal is the encoded video signal recorded in the first 
recording mode;
a fifth means for passing the video signal distributed
thereto for the reproduction thereof, wherein the video signal

is the decoded video signal recorded in the second recording
mode; and
a sixth means for processing the video signal distributed
thereto for the reproduction thereof, wherein the video signal

is the intra-mode compressed video signal recorded in the
third recording mode.
The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the
second means includes a decoder for decoding the encoded video

signal to produce the decoded video signal.
The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the
third means includes an intra-mode transformer for

transforming the encoded video signal to the intra-mode
compressed video signal.
The apparatus as recited in claim 3, wherein the
intra mode transformer contains:


a decoder for decoding the encoded video signal to
produce a decoded video signal defining a sequence of frames;

and
an encoder block for encoding the decoded video signal
using an intraframe correlation to produce the intra-mode 

compressed video signal, said encoder block having a discrete
cosine transform coder for transforming the decoded video

signal into a set of intra-mode transform coefficients, an
intra-mode quantizer for quantizing the set of intra-mode

transform coefficients using a quantization step size to
produce an intra-mode quantization signal, and a variable

length coder for coding the intra-mode quantization signal to
produce the intra-mode compressed video signal.
The apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the
apparatus further comprises an output selector for selectively

outputting the video signal from the fourth, the fifth or the
sixth means in accordance with the detected recording mode .
