<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD) reactors for the processing 
of semiconductor wafers, and particularly to CVD 
reactor modules for semiconductor wafer processing 
cluster tools. More particularly, the present 
invention is applicable to the CVD of coating 
materials such as tungsten, titanium nitride and 
other metal and dielectric substances onto silicon 
semiconductor wafers, and to other silicon 
processes in which mass transport is a present but 
not controlling characteristic of the process. In the manufacture of semiconductor 
wafers and of other similarly manufactured 
articles, sequences of processes including coating, 
etching, heat treating and patterning are 
sequentially employed. Most of these processes 
involve the chemical or physical addition or 
removal of material to or from a surface of a 
substrate, usually transported as a vapor.  
 Certain coating processes in such 
sequences are performed by chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD). CVD is preferred, for example, 
in applying films to the differently facing 
surfaces of holes through underlying layers, as, 
for example, to apply conductive films for the 
purpose of making interconnections across 
insulating layers and the like. The ultimate result of CVD processes for 
filling holes or vias, and for forming 
interconnections between layers on semiconductor 
wafers, is frequently the selective deposition of 
the film, that is, formation of a permanent film on 
only selected portions of the wafer surfaces. 
Direct selective application by CVD of such 
coatings is often unreliable, unsuccessful, or 
slow, and thus undesirable on a commercial scale, 
where rapid throughput and efficient use of 
expensive machinery is important. Therefore, 
selective end product films are often applied in 
blanket fashion and then etched back from the areas 
where permanent film is undesired. Blanket CVD of materials, such as 
tungsten, followed by an etching back of the 
deposited material, requires a high degree of 
uniformity in the blanket film, particularly on the 
areas of a substrate from which the materiai is to  
 
be etched. If the coating is irregular in the 
etch-back areas, the etching process may 
selectively damage the underlying layers in regions 
of the wafer where the blanket film to be etched is 
thin, or may result in regions where residual film 
remains. CVD reactors of the prior art have coated 
substrates with limited uniformity, or at limited 
speed. Accordingly, more uniform application of 
the films
