<ABSTRACT>
The parallel midbody (132) for the hull of a 
tanker is fabricated of modules (124), each made of 

double-walled longitudinal subassemblies (108) welded 
to one another and to a bulkhead (118). The subassemblies 

are made of outer cylindrically curved 
plates (32) welded edge to edge, and inner cylindrically 

curved plates (32) welded edge to edge. 
Longitudinal rib plates (66) are extended between and 

are welded into joints between curved plates in the 
inner and outer hulls. The curved plates (32) are 

convex towards the exterior of the vessel. At 
respective transitions between the bottom and sides, 

the inner and outer hulls have bilge radii which 
approximate in size the radii of curvature of others 

of the plates including ones both adjacent to and 
remote from the bottom-to-side transitions. A 

fixture (82 ) for facilitating welding of the T-joints 
(104) of the subassemblies is provided. The 

subassemblies (108) and modules (124) are fabricated 
in an up-ended orientation. Each successively 

completed module (124) is tilted-over and joined to 
the growing midbody (132) with the aid of a variable 

buoyancy barge (120) and a caisson pontoon (134).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fixture for 
fabricating a longitudinal sub assembly for a vessel hull. The present specification contains some subject 
matter in common with the specification EP-A-0,460,851 
(EPA 91304788.2) and has been divided therefrom. In the U.S. patent to Tornay, 4,638,754, issued 
January 27, 1987, there is disclosed a vessel hull and 
construction method, which is said to be particularly 
suitable for vessels of double hull construction, such as 
gas tankers with almost complete double hulls, and oil 
and product tankers with double bottoms. The disclosed 
system is said to be suitable for construction of 
commercial and naval ships and barges, and to be 
adaptable to provide any arrangement of decks and 
bulkheads within the hull. In the construction system disclosed in 
the Tornay patent, the plating of the outer hull and 
bulkheads is constructed of standard-sized steel plates, 
usually about 8 feet by 40 feet, which are rolled to a 
slight cylindrical curvature, the axis of which is 
parallel to the longer edge. On the shell of the vessel, 
the plates are arranged with their long edges 
longitudinal. The plates are arranged with the curvature 
inwards or outwards, depending on the direction of the 
highest local load. The curved plates are then provided 
with a reverse bend or recurve along the midline between 
the long longitudinal edges. The short transverse edges 
and the long longitudinal edges are butt-welded together. 
To the midline of the plates at the recurve are welded 
longitudinal steel girders such as L or T-beams which 
match the recurved portion of the curved plates and are 
of sufficient depth and section modulus to span the 
distance between transverse bulkheads or deep webs. The 
local pressure loading on the plate causes a tensile or 
compressive stress, depending on the direction of the 
load, uniformly across the thickness of the curved plate 
in the same way that a cylindrical pressure vessel is 
stressed by an internal pressure. Because the plating is 
not subjected to local panel bending, closely spaced  
 
primary stiffeners are said to be not required. In 
addition to efficiently absorbing local pressure forces 
such as transverse membrane stresses, the curve and 
reverse curve also are said to provide stiffness in the 
longitudinal direction needed to resist compressive 
buckling caused by longitudinal hull bending stresses. 
An additional efficiency is said to be obtained from the 
girders along the midline of the curved plates, and thus 
contr
