<ABSTRACT>
A device for storing cylindrical objects, such as small flasks (14) containing samples of radioactive products, comprises one or more superposed rotary racks (30, 30'). Each rack comprises circumferentially distributed cavities (32, 32'), in which the objects are held. The cavities are open radially outwards, with respect to the vertical axis of rotation of the racks (30, 30'). Furthermore, their axis is inclined so as to intersect this axis of rotation above the cavity. Accidental escape of the objects is thus avoided.

Device for the storage of objects (14) having a substantially cylindrical
configuration comprising at least one storage rack (30, 30') which can

be turned around a vertical axis and provided with cavities (32, 32') able to
receive the objects circumferentially distributed around said vertical axis

and means (22) for controlling the rotation of the rack around said axis,
the cavities (32, 32') are open radially to the outside, so as to permit

radial introduction and extraction of the objects, characterized in that each
cavity (32, 32') has an axis inclined so as to intersect the vertical axis

of the rack above the latter.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that an ejecting member
(46, 46') is placed in each cavity (32, 32') and has an active part which can

be given a substantially radial movement with respect to the vertical axis
of the rack (30, 30') between a retracted position and an ejection position.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the ejecting member is
rocking lever (46, 46') mounted on a horizontal pivot pin (48, 48) placed at

the top of the cavity and oriented perpendicular to a radial direction with
respect to the vertical axis of the rack, said active part being constituted

by a first branch of the lever normally oriented towards the bottom, upstream
of the axis of the cavity and along the wall of the latter closest to the

pivot pin of the lever.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the rocking lever
(46, 46') has a second branch normally oriented radially towards the vertical

axis of the rack and in a substantially horizontal direction, ejection means
(42, 44, 50) being provided for exerting a downward thrust on the second

lever branch.
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the ejection means
comprise a jack (42) mounted on a support (20) and a vertical thrust rod

(44) able to move parallel to itself during a jack actuation, a bottom end
of the thrust rod being placed above the second branch of the rocking lever

(46, 46') of a cavity (32, 32') located to the right of an ejection station 
(54) of the device.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that at least two storage racks (30, 30') are arranged coaxially in superimposed

manner.
Device according to claims 5 and 6 combined, characterized in that the
cavities (32, 32') of the two racks (30, 30') are angularly displaced about

their vertical axis, the ejection means having for each cavity (32') of the
lower rack a vertical rod section (50) mounted in sliding manner between two

cavities of the upper rack and whose lower end is flush with the second
branch of the rocking lever (46') of said cavity of the lower rack and a

means (52) for returning the vertical rod section (50) to the top position.
Device according to either of the claims 6 and 7, characterized in that
means (18) are provided for displacing the storage racks (30, 30') parallel

to their vertical axis in order to permit an introduction and an extraction
of the objects at a constant level.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that a charging station (115) of the storage rack (30, 30') including a

compressed air injector (58) is provided.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that it is applied to the storage of radioactive objects, the storage rack

(30, 308) being placed within a confinement cell, all the actuating means
(18, 22, 42) and the sensors of the storage device being positioned outside

said cell and an additional biological protection (62) can be placed on the
wall (10) of the cell facing the actuating means (18, 22, 42) and said

sensors.
