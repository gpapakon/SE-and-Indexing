<ABSTRACT>
The electrolytic cell 1 for producing alkali hydroxide 
or hydrogen peroxide is divided into the anode compartment 

3 and the cathode compartment 4 by the cation exchange 
membrane 2. The cathode compartment 4 is further divided 

by the anion exchange membrane 6 into the solution 
compartment 7 containing a concentrated aqueous solution of 

alkali hydroxide and the gas compartment accommodating the 
gas cathode 8. The anion exchange membrane 6 prevents the 

gas cathode 8 from coming into direct or indirect contact 
with the aqueous solution of 
alkali hydroxide. This leads 
to the extended life of the gas cathode. The above-mentioned 

arrangement is effective in large-sized 
electrolytic cells. Thus, the present invention can be 

applied to industrial electrolysis which has never been 
achieved with the conventional gas electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
efficient production of alkali hydroxide by electrolysis of
an aqueous solution of alkali chloride. More particularly,
the present invention relates to an electrolytic cell and
a process for electrolyzing alkali chloride on a large
industrial scale with a reduced power consumption.The present invention also relates to an electrolytic
cell and process for efficient production of hydrogen
peroxide to be used as an oxidizing agent in many areas.Production of sodium hydroxide and chlorine from brine
constitutes an important part of the electrolytic industry.
Many improvements have been made on the process and
electrolytic cell in this field.The most advanced industrial process in this field is
the ion exchange membrane process. It employs an insoluble
anode having an overvoltage as low as tens of mV and an
activated cathode having an overvoltage of about 100 mV,
between which is interposed an ion exchange membrane whose
electric resistance has been owing to recent improvements.
Therefore, the electrolytic voltage of this process is
about 3 V, which is close to the theoretical value of 2.2-2.4
V. In other words, this process has reached a stage in
which there is no room for further improvement in energy 
saving (except for unavoidable ohmic loss).The electrolysis of sodium chloride is represented by
the following chemical equation.
2NaCl + 2H2O → 2NaOH + Cl2 + H2
Although the sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas as the
products are fully utilized, the hydrogen as the by-product
is not fully utilized at the present time. The
electrolytic voltage required for the evolution of hydrogen
is theoretically about 0.83 V. This voltage is equivalent
to the amount of power consumption that would be saved if
an adequate measure is taken to carry out electrolysis
without the evolution of hydrogen.The means developed for this purpose is the oxygen
depolarizing electrode (gas electrode), which is based on
the principle that if the cathode is supplied with oxygen
gas, the cathode reaction proceeds as shown below
H2O + 2e + 1/202 → 20H- (0.40 V)
in place of the conventional reaction represented by
H2O + e → OH- + 1/2H2 (-0.83V)
The theoretical consequence is the saving of electric power
equivalent to about 1.2 V.Hydrogen peroxide is. an oxidizing agent used for pulp
bleaching, etc. There is an established technique for
producing hydrogen peroxide from oxygen or oxygen-containing
gas (such as air), also using a gas electrode.
Its improvement is still going on, as reported in "Denki
