<DESCRIPTION>
A great deal of research is currently underway to
develop treatments and cures for viral infections in humans
and in animals. Notably the incidence of AIDS and ARC in
humans is increasing at an alarming rate. The five year
survival rate for those with AIDS is dispiriting and AIDS
patients, whose immune systems have been seriously impaired
by the infection, suffer from numerous opportunistic
infections including Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia. No cure for AIDS is known and current
treatments are largely without adequate proof of efficacy
and have numerous untoward side effects. Fear of the
disease has resulted in social ostracism of and
discrimination against those having or suspected of having
the disease.Retroviruses are a class of ribonucleic acid (RNA)
viruses that replicate by using reverse transcriptase to
form a strand of complementary DNA (cDNA) from which a
double stranded, proviral DNA is produced. This proviral
DNA is then incorporated into the chromasomal DNA of the
host cell making possible viral replication by 
transcription of this integrated DNA and translation of
viral messenger RNA into proteins; assembly of new viral
RNA into a protein core and release from the cell results
in the formation of infectious virus progeny.Many of the known retroviruses are oncogenic or tumor
causing. Indeed the first two human retroviruses
discovered, denoted human T-cell leukemia virus I and II or
HTLV-I and II, were found to cause rare leukemias in humans
after infection of T-lymphocytes. The third such human
virus to be discovered, HTLV-III, now referred to as HIV,
was found to cause cell death after infection of
T-lymphocytes and has been identified as the causative
agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and
AIDS related complex (ARC).The envelope protein of HIV is a 160 kDa glycoprotein.
The protein is cleaved by a protease to give a 120 kDa
external protein, gp 120, and a transmembrane glycoprotein,
gp 41. The gp 120 protein contains the amino acid sequence
that recognizes the receptor on CD4-positive human T-helper
cells. Applicants have discovered that a class of
sulfonated stilbenes that bear sulfonic acid groups are
active against HIV. Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) I and II
as well cytomegalovirus (CMV) have functionally related
glycoprotein coatings and infections caused by these
viruses can also be diminished or eliminated by the use of
the sulfonated stilbenes of this invention. The present invention provides novel compounds of
