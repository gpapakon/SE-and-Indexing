<ABSTRACT>
A low air loss patient support system (20) 
includes a plurality of identical multi-chambered 

inflatable sacks (34). A restrictive flow hole (64) 
connects two adjacent chambers (46, 54) disposed 

predominately to one side of the centerline of the sack, 
and each side is separately pressurizable under the 

control of a microprocessor (160) and a plurality of 
pressure control valves (162) with pressure transducers 

and a plurality of flow diverter valves (220) for 
switching between different modes of configuring the 

manner in which the sacks are pressurized. The system 
includes a modular manifold (128) for mounting the 

pressure control valves (162), and a modular support 
member for mounting the sacks via quick-disconnect 

couplings and having air flow channels defined 
therethrough. The support system can rotate or tilt the 

patient by depressurizing one side of the sacks (34) 
while increasing the pressurization of the opposite side 

of the sacks. An end chamber (46) of the depressurized 
side of each sack remains inflated while the adjacent 

intermediate chamber (54) becomes progressively deflated 
during depressurization to permit the end chambers to 

restrain the patient from sliding off the sacks during 
tilting. The support system can relieve pressure points 

between the patient and the sacks while elevating the 
head and chest of the patient by reconfiguring the 

diverter valves (162) to connect alternating sacks at the 
same pressure and periodically decreasing the pressure in  

 
one group of sacks while increasing the pressure in 

another group of sacks alternately to relieve the 
pressure of and on the patient between the two different 

groups of sacks depending upon which group is 
depressurizing and which group is being increased in 

pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air sack support manifold
apparatus for a
low air loss patient support system.Patients confined to beds for long periods of time
must be turned frequently to rest on different portions
of their bodies in order to avoid the onset of bed sores
or to alleviate discomfort associated with same.
Turning the patient also helps avoid accumulation of
fluid in the lungs. Heretofore, turning a patient has
been a labor intensive task of the hospital staff, and
the rising cost of hospital staff has made this task
ever more expensive for the hospital and ultimately the
patient.Though not a low air loss bed, one apparatus and
method of turning a patient is disclosed in U.S.-A
No. 3,485,240 to Fountain. The apparatus has cushions
11, 12, which overlap one another substantially so that
substantially the patient's entire body may be accommodated
by each pad. Each cushion is normally not
inflated when the patient rests horizontally on the bed.
Each cushion has a surface that can be inclined when
inflated. A mechanism 30 individually inflates and
evacuates cushions 11, 12 and includes an outlet switch
31, a timer 32, and a four-way valve 33. In one
position, valve 33 connects cushion 11 to a vacuum to
evacuate same and cushion 12 to a pump to inflate same.
In a second position, cushion 12 is connected to the 
pump and cushion 11 is connected to the vacuum. The
timer controls the sequence of alternating between the
two positions of valve 33. Each cushion can be segmented
to permit different segments to be inflatable to
a different degree or contour.In order to prevent slippage of the patient on the
inclined surface of the Fountain cushions, the patient
is required to be confined by straps 41, 42 around the
patient's legs for example. This constraint becomes
useless if the patient is an amputee and is detrimental
to the healing process if the patient has sores or
wounds on the legs or other portions of the body that
would be constrained by the straps. Moreover, such
straps are uncomfortable and interfere with the ability
of the patient to repose restfully. Furthermore, the
inflation and evacuation mechanism 30 does not permit a
steady state of partial evacuation of cushions 11, 12,
requiring instead either total deflation or total
inflation during the steady state of operation that
occurs once inflation and evacuation is complete.Another apparatus and method for automatically
turning a patient confined to a low air loss bed is
disclosed in European Patent Application No. A-0
260 087 to
