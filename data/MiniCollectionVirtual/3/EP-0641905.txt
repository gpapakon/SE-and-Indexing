<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shuttering board which consists of an essentially rigid basic material and is intended, for example, for clearances in a wall or ceiling region of concrete structural parts. In order to form clearances or the like, such shuttering boards have to be sawn to size and then nailed together. This is expensive and can result in inaccuracies. The invention solves this problem in that the shuttering board is produced from a brittle material which can be bent at prefabricated predetermined bending points (6, 7, 12, 19, 20), a deformable and bendable reinforcement (2, 3, 10) which is integrated in the shuttering board then holding the bent parts together in the desired manner.

<CLAIMS>
Shuttering board of an essentially rigid base material 
(1), in particular for use as permanent shuttering for 

producing recesses in the wall or ceiling region of concrete 
building units, which comprises a flexible, foldable 

reinforcement (2, 3; 10) and into which at least one folding 
point (6, 7; 12, 19, 20) is formed,
 
characterised in that a folding point (7, 18) extends 

parallel to a folding point (6, 12), which is formed in one 
surface (4, 13) of the board, in the other surface (5, 11) 

of the board, which point (7, 18) is essentially of the same 
type. 
Shuttering board according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that a plurality of folding points (6; 12, 

19, 20) are provided at uniform spacings. 
Shuttering board according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the reinforcement (2, 3; 10) is 

embedded in the surface region of the shuttering board. 
Shuttering board according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the deformable reinforcement (3, 10) 

is disposed near one surface (5, 11) and the first folding 
point (6, 12) is formed in the other surface. 
Shuttering board according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the folding points are formed as a 

groove (19, 20), the bottom (17) of which lies near the 
reinforcement (10) and the walls (14, 15) of which form an 

angle of approximately 90Â°. 
Shuttering board according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that thin webs (21, 22), which can be 

broken out, are disposed in the groove (19, 20) transversely 
thereto.  

 
Shuttering board according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that the webs (21, 22) comprise in the 

region of their apex a reinforcement extending beyond the 
groove region. 
Shuttering board according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the base material (1) is a cementbonded 

lightweight building material. 
Shuttering board according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the reinforcement (2, 3; 10) is formed 

by a woven fibre fabric or a fibre fleece, in particular a 
glass fibre material.
