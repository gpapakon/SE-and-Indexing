<ABSTRACT>
The train's planetary pinion (3) is driven by the driving shaft (3), and has two sets of teeth (17,18). One (17) meshes with an annulus (8) forming a torque support, and the other (18) with the driven shaft (5). The pinion rotates on the axis of an eccentric portion (14) of the driving shaft. An eccentric weight (7) can be mounted on the pinion, and the eccentric can be formed by a cylindrical body (6) with axis parallel to that of the driving shaft. Alternatively its axis can be inclined to that of the shaft, or there can be an eccentric bore in the shaft parallel to the axis of the latter.
