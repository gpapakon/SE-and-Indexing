<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns biodegradable polymers, more 
particularly lipophilic polymers which are biodegradable 
to form water-soluble polymers. Biodegradable polymers have long been used in the 
medical field, for example to provide biodegradable 
implant materials and delayed release drug delivery 
systems. They are now of wider interest in overcoming the 
problem of pollution by long-lived insert packaging 
materials, household articles, detergents and the like. There is also a need for polymers which, when they 
wholly or partially break down by chemical or biological 
means, give reliably non-toxic and readily eliminable 
products. In general, biodegradation commonly involves enzymic 
hydrolysis of particular chemical bonds in the polymer, 
notably ester, urethane or amide groups which are 
otherwise stable in the absence of enzymes; such 
hydrolysis may additionaly or alternatively be effected by 
the presence of acids or bases. Thus, for packaging 
materials, aliphatic polyesters such as polycaprolactone, 
polyethylene adipate and polyglycolic acid are candidate 
materials although polyethylene terephthalate, which is 
very widely used in textiles and fibres, is resistant to 
biodegradation. In the medical field, resorbable polymers are of 
interest for sutures and in wound closure, resorbable 
implants in the treatment of osteomyelitis and other bone 
lesions, tissue stapling and mesh tamponades, anastomosis 
as well as drug delivery systems and diagnostics. In 
these fields, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, poly (L-lactide-co-glycolide), 
polydioxanone, poly (glycolide-co-trimethylene 
carbonate), poly (ethylene carbonate), poly 
(iminocarbonates), polyhydroxybutyrate, poly (amino  
 
acids), poly (ester-amides), poly (orthoesters) and poly 
(anhydrides) have all been proposed (T.H. Barrows, 
Clinical Materials 1 (1986), pp. 233-257) as well as 
natural products such as polysaccharides. US-A-4180646, 
in particular, describes novel poly (orthoesters) for use 
in a very wide range of products. In our co-pending International Patent Application 
No. WO92/04392, 
we describe a broad range of polymers 
characterised in that they contain optionally substituted 
methylene diester units of the formula (I) 
[CO-O-C(R1R2)-O-CO] 
(where R1 and R2 each represent a hydrogen atom or a 
carbon-attached monovalent organic group or R1 and R2 
together form a carbon-attached divalent organic group). 
Such units are particularly rapidly degraded by common 
esterase enzymes but are stable in the absence of
