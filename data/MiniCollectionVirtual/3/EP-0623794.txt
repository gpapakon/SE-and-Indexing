<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for cooling chocolate mass in a refrigerator (8), the interior of the refrigerator being subdivided into four quadrants (I, II, III, IV), and a single air stream (f) being generated in order to treat the chocolate product (7), and said air stream (f) first of all acting on the product located in the third zone (III) of the quadrant and then influencing the product located in the second zone (II) of the quadrant and subsequently acting on the product located in the first zone (I) of the quadrant in order finally to act on the product (7) located in the fourth zone (IV) of the quadrant. This is made possible by a cooling device (14) in which the moulds (7) for receiving the product are arranged in the form of vertical columns, and the cooling chamber is subdivided into four quadrants (I, II, III, IV) by means of a horizontally arranged wall (30) and the mould columns, the inlet (10) for the cooling-air stream being provided in correspondence with the third zone (III) of the quadrant of the refrigerator, and the opening (11) for the outlet of the cooling-air stream being arranged in correspondence with the fourth zone (IV) of the quadrant, and use being made, for generating the cooling-air stream, of a single ventilating and cooling device (14) which is connected to the air inlet (10) and the air outlet (11) of the refrigerator.
