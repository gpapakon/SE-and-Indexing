<DESCRIPTION>
This relates to a vertical cavity surface emitting laser that emits radiation in the
visible spectrum (i.e., in the range between 400 and
700 nanometers).Conventional edge-emitting laser diodes are well
known. In these diodes, laser radiation is emitted in
a plane that is a continuation of the plane of the p-n
junction that forms the diode. Different types of
these diodes are widely used to provide laser
radiation in the infrared and visible regions. While
these diodes have enjoyed considerable commercial
success, they are relatively large and, as a result,
are difficult to integrate with other devices.Recently, a new class of semiconductor lasers
known as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser has
been developed. Unlike the edge-emitting laser, these
vertical cavity lasers emit laser radiation in the
direction perpendicular to the plane of the p-n
junction formed in the laser diode. Considerable
information concerning the structure and formation of
such laser diodes is set forth, for example, in U.S.

publications, vertical cavity lasers have numerous
advantages over edge-emitting lasers, some of the most
important of which are that they can be fabricated in
extremely small sizes (e.g., on the order of one
micrometer in diameter) and can readily be integrated
with other devices such as transistors.To date, however, applications of vertical cavity
lasers have been limited by the absence of any
vertical cavity laser which emits visible laser
radiation.The present invention provides a vertical-cavity laser having the features of claim 1 and which
emits laser radiation in the visible region. In these
devices, laser radiation can be stimulated by optical
pumping or by electrical injection.In a preferred embodiment of the
