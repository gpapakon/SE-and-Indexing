<DESCRIPTION>
 Phosphoπopeptides with collagenase inhibiting activity.The present invention relates to novel phosphorus derivatives, processes for their preparation and their use in medicine. In particular, the present invention relates to their use as inhibitors of enzymes of the collagenase family of neutral metalloproteases, for treating arthritic and other diseases.The mammalian collagenase family of enzymes comprises a number of proteases, exemplified by interstitial (type I) collagenase itself, the stromelysins (also known as proteoglycanases or transins) , fibroblast and poly orphonuclear leucocyte gelatinases (also known as collagen-IV-ases) , and 'pump-l1 (putative metalloprotease 1, uterine metalloprotease) [Goldberg βt al, J. Biol. Chem. 2610, 6600, 1986/ Whitham et al, Biochem. J. 240, 913, 1986; Breathnach βt al, Nucleic Acids Res., 15, 1139, 1987; Muller βt al, Biochem. J., 253, 187, 1988; Collier et al, J. Biol. Chem., 263, 6579, 1988; Murphy et al, Biochem. J., 258, 463, 1989; Quantin βt al, Biochem. (N.Y.), 28, 5327, 1989; Birkedal-Hansen, J. Oral Pathol., 17, 445, 1988; P. Basset et al, Nature 348, 699, 1990] . Membership of the mammalian collagenase family of proteases is evident by possession of a number of highly characteristic and experimentally verifiable properties as described in EPA 401963 (Beecham Group) , which can be adopted as criteria for allocation to this family of enzymes.As a particular example of the therapeutic value of inhibitors of the collagenase family of enzymes, such as are disclosed in the present invention, chronic arthritic diseases leading to extensive loss of the collagen, proteoglycan and elastin components of the cartilage, bone and tendons within the joints, should be amenable to treatment with inhibitors of the collagenases, proteoglycanases (stromelysins) and gelatinases currently thought to be the major enzymes involved. 

 These enzymes have been detected in extracts of synovial and cartilage tissue, and have also been extensively studied in tissue cultures of a wide range of connective tissues. Apart from control of the biosynthesis, secretion and activation of the enzymes, the most important natural regulation of these enzymes in normal and diseased states, is considered to be the endogenous production of inhibitors such as the Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases and alpha-2 macroglobulin. An imbalance between the local levels of the proteolytic enzymes and of their natural inhibitors will allow destruction of connective tissue components to occur.The
