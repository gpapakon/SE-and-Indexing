<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a method for neutralising chemical munitions (1) of the type comprising a body (1a) containing a chemical charge and a fuze (fuse) (1b) mounted at one end of the said body (1a). The method consists in centring and positioning the end of the body (1a) fitted with the fuze (1b) in a bath (3) for dissolving the chemical charge, in rotationally driving the munition (1), in separating the fuze (1b) from the body (1a) of the munition, in recovering the fuze (1b) from the body (1a) of the munition (1), in fluxing (cleaning the surface) and rinsing the inside of the body (1a) of the munition (1), in fluxing and rinsing the outside of the fuze (1b) and in extracting the fuze (1b) and the body (1a) of the munition (1) from the dissolving bath (3). The subject of the invention is also an automatic installation for neutralising chemical munitions.

tight vessel (2) containing a dissolution bath (3) for the

chemical charge and provided with a closing cover (4);

a pincer device (10) for handling the ammunition (1),
means (20) for centering and positioning the end of the
body (1a) provided with the fuse (1b) in the dissolution

bath (3),
means (30) for rotating the ammunition (1),
means (40) for separating the fuse (1b) from the body (1a)
of the ammunition (1),
means (50) for supporting the fuse (1b) separated from the
body (1a) of the ammunition (1),
means (60) for cleaning and rinsing the inside of the body
(1a) of the ammunition (1),
means (70) for cleaning and rinsing the outside of the
fuse (1b),
means (80) allowing access to the inside of the vessel (2)
for the removal of the cleaned and rinsed fuse (1b),
and elements for operating and controlling the said means.
Installation according to claim 1, characterised in that
the means (20) for centering and positioning the end of the

body (1a) provided with the fuse (1b) in the dissolution
bath (3) are formed by a casing (200) which is supported by

the cover (4) and is mounted on the one hand in a tight
manner and on the other hand to be freely rotatable on the

said cover (4). 
Installation according to claim 2, characterised in that
the casing (200) contains a sealing material (202) having a

passage for receiving the body (1a) of the ammunition (1)
and has, in its lower portion, a metal centering ring (203)

which is interchangeable and is provided with a bore (204)
having a profile that corresponds to the outer profile of

the body (1a) of the ammunition (1).
Installation according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the means (30) for rotating the
ammunition (1) by way of the casing (200) are formed by a

crown-wheel (301) which is formed at the upper periphery of
the said casing (200) outside the cover (4) and is to

cooperate with a pinion (302) which is driven in rotation by
a variable speed gear motor (303).
Installation according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the means (40) for separating the fuse
(1b) from the body (1a) of the ammunition (1) are formed by

a lance (401) with a water jet mixed with abrasive charge,
which lance extends perpendicularly to the axis of the

casing (200) and is arranged inside the vessel (2).
Installation according to claim 5, characterised in that
the lance (401) is fixed to the lower end of a bracket (402)

which is mounted, so as to be free in rotation and in
translation parallel to the axis of the casing (200), in a

sheath (403) which contains a sealing material (404) and is
supported by the cover (4).
Installation according to claim 6, characterised in that
the sheath (403) has means (405, 406) for stopping the

rotation and translatory movement of the bracket (402). 
Installation according to claim 6, characterised in that
the lance (401) is connected to a supply of water and of

abrasive charge.
Installation according to claims 1 and 2, characterised
in that the means (50) for supporting the fuse (1b) which

has been separated from the body (1a) of the ammunition (1)
are formed by a cylinder (501) which is arranged in the

vessel (2) and is provided with an interchangeable ring
(502) according to the outer profile of the fuse (1b), the

said ring (501) being displaceable between a first position
located in the axis of the casing (200) for the recovery of

the fuse (1b) and a second position away from the axis for
the positioning of the fuse (1b) opposite means (70) for

cleaning and rinsing the outside of the said fuse (1b).
Installation according to claim 9, characterised in that
the hoop (501) is mounted at the end of an arm which is

integral with a hub (504) which is fixed to the lower end of
