<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a polymerization
inhibitor system for vinyl aromatic compounds. In
particular, the polymerisation inhibitor contains the
active ingredient which is a reaction product of a C9
-C20 alkyl phenol with sulfuric acid and nitric acid,
believed to be structurally represented by a blend of
compounds of structure (I)

wherein R is C9 - C20 alkyl, Y is NO2, SO3R'or H, R' is
C1-C20 alkyl, X is NO2 or C1-C20 alkyl, and R'' is H or
C1-C20 alkyl, m is 2 or 3 and n is 0,1,2,3, with the
proviso that when R is C9 and n=O, then X and Y may not
both be NO2.In other aspects, this invention is directed to a
vinyl aromatic composition stabilized against
polymerization by such polymerization inhibitor system, 
as well as to a method of stabilizing a vinyl aromatic
composition against polymerization which method
comprises adding an effective amount of such
polymerization inhibitor system.Commercial processes for the manufacture of vinyl
aromatic compounds such as monomeric styrene, divinyl
benzene and lower alkylated styrenes (such as
alpha-methylstyrene and vinyltoluene) typically produce
products contaminated with various impurities, such as
benzene, toluene and the like. These impurities must be
removed in order for the monomer product to be suitable
for most applications. Such purification of vinyl
aromatic compounds is generally accomplished by
distillation.However, it is well known that vinyl aromatic
compounds polymerize readily and that the rate of
polymerization increases rapidly as the temperature
increases. In order to prevent polymerization of the
vinyl aromatic monomer under distillation conditions
various polymerization inhibitors have been employed.In general, the compounds which are commercially
employed as such polymerization inhibitors are of the
dinitrophenolic class. Thus, for example, Drake et al,
in U. S. Pat. 2,526,567, show the stabilization of
nuclear chlorostyrenes employing 2,6-dinitrophenols.
Similarly, U. S. Pat. 4,105,506, to Watson, discloses
the use of 2,6-dinitro-p-cresol as a polymerization 
inhibitor for vinyl aromatic compounds.In addition, it has been disclosed by Butler et al,
in U. S. Pat. 4,466,905, that, in the presence of
oxygen, phenylenediamines in the distillation column
together with 2,6-dinitro-p-cresol will reduce the
amount of polymerization which occurs.While dinitrophenols are effective polymerization
inhibitors, there are several disadvantages associated
with their use, either alone or in blends. For example,
many dinitrophenols are solids that,
