<ABSTRACT>
In a handy computer having an image pickup unit, a 
drawing or map information of a large area which including a 

prearranged portion to be inspected is stored, the prearranged 
portion to be inspected is specified on the drawing or the 

map information to thereby calculate positional data. The 
positional data is associated with photographed image data of 

an inspected portion which has been photographed by the image 
pickup unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a handy computer with 
a built-in digital camera, which is capable of being readily 
used for inspection of various constructions during or after 
execution of construction work, for spot inspection of the 
state of executing construction work of roads, railways or 
rivers, and the maintenance state thereof, and further for 
record of accidental spots or management of parking offenses, 
etc. The invention also relates to a spot state recording 
method using the same camera. For example, there are many situations where, in a new 
constructions work or a reconstruction work for various 
constructions, the state of under construction and after the 
construction are inspected and recorded (hereinafter referred 
to as "spot inspection"). Up to now, the spot inspection has 
been recorded as stated below. Firstly, Both of a primary 
constructor and a subconstructor carry a construction plan 
and a camera to the spot, and at the spot, the primary 
constructor recognizes whether the construction work is 
executed in accordance with the plan or not, and if he finds  
 
out any defective portions, he indicates this matter to the 
subconstructor. Then, the subconstructor checks the portion 
thus indicated on the plan, takes a photograph of the 
indicated portion, and records the photograph and the 
indicated portion on the plan in association with each other 
on a document. However, it is troublesome to associate the defective 
portion indicated on the plan with the photograph, and also it 
is not easy to write the inspected matters in the plan and to 
handle the camera at the working spot with an insufficient 
footing. Further, materials prepared on the basis of the 
inspection like this need to be kept for a given period of 
time. However, since the materials are stored in the form of 
documents, it is troublesome to take out the necessary 
materials from a large amount of inspection materials some 
other day. In order to rationalize the management of the 
materials, it is considered to store the materials in an 
electronic file. In this case, the construction design plan 
and the photographic image must be read by an image scanner 
or the like, resulting also in troublesomeness. Various problems as mentioned above are not limited to 
the spot inspection for the state of the construction work, 
but also commonly applied to other works requiring the spot 
inspection. For example, for recording the spot inspection for the  
 
state of executing construction work of roads, railways

<CLAIMS>
A handy computer with a built-in digital camera 
in which an image pickup unit mainly including a charge 

coupled device and an imaging lens is coupled with a handy 
computer body including a portable interior power source and 

a bus coupling terminal for connection of a peripheral 
equipment, said handy computer comprising: 

   memory means for storing one of drawing and map 
information of a large area which includes a spot to be 

inspected; 
   display means for switching/division-displaying a 

graphic display for one of said drawing and the map 
information and an image photographed by said image pickup 

unit; 
   a microprocessor for executing internal processing of 

said handy computer body and for processing an image output 
signal transmitted from said image pickup unit; 

   input operating means for giving various instructions 
to said handy computer body and for inputting data; 

   means for selectively calling one of a drawing and map 
information of a small area which includes an actual spot to 

be inspected from the whole information of one of the drawing 
and the map stored in said memory means and having the large 

area which includes the prearranged spot to be inspected for 
graphic display; 

   display means for specifying and indicating an actual 
 

spot to be inspected in one of the drawing and the map 
information having the small area which is graphically 

displayed on said display means; 
   means for calculating positional data on one of the 

drawing and map information specified and indicated on said 
display means; and 

   means for storing the photographed image data 
transmitted from said image pickup unit and said positional 

data in association with each other. 
A handy computer with a built-in digital camera 
as claimed in Claim 2, further comprising a transportable 

memory medium having a memory capacity for storing one of the 
drawing and map information of the large area including the 

prearranged spot to be inspected, said transportable memory 
medium being detachably attached to said handy computer and a 

computer located in a fixed base, said transportable memory 
medium constituting data medium between said handy computer 

and said computer. 
A handy computer with a built-in digital camera 
as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, further comprising a GPS adaptor 

using a communication satellite for measuring an absolute 
position. 
A handy computer with a built-in digital camera 
as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said image pickup unit is 

detachably attached to said handy computer body. 
A method of recording a spot state, comprising 
 

the steps of: 
   transferring one of drawing and map information of a 

large area which includes a spot to be inspected from a 
library for one of the drawing and the map stored in a 

computer located in a fixed base to a handy computer with a 
built-in digital camera as claimed in Claim 1 directly or 

through a portable memory medium; 
   Carrying said handy computer with said built-in 

digital camera which stores one of the drawing and map 
information of a large area which includes the spot to be 

inspected, and selectively calling, on a display means, one 
of the drawing and map information of a small area which 

includes an actual spot to be inspected from the whole 
information of one of the drawing and map of a large area 

stored in said memory means for graphic display; 
   specifying and displaying the actual spot to be 

inspected in one of the drawing and map information of a small 
area graphically displayed on said display means, and 

calculating positional data of the portion on one of the 
drawing and map information; 

   adjusting a pose of said handy computer with said 
built-in digital camera so that the actual spot to be 

inspected falls within a view field of an image pickup unit to 
photograph the portion to be inspected; 

   means for storing the photographed image data 
transmitted from said image pickup unit and said positional 

 
data in association with each other in a memory means; and 

   transferring the photographed image data and the
