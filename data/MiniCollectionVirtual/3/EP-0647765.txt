<ABSTRACT>
A well is perforated using a coiled tubing 
conveyed perforating gun. A perforating tool string (318) 

includes a coiled tubing string (320), a perforating gun 
(322), a releasable gun hanger (324), and a pressure 

responsive release (330) connecting the coiled tubing string 
(320) to the perforating gun (322). The perforating tool 

string (318) is lowered into place within the well and then 
the gun hanger (324) is actuated by reciprocating motion of 

the coiled tubing string (318) without rotating the coiled 
tubing string, thereby setting the gun hanger (324) in the 

casing (308). Fluid pressure is then increased in the 
coiled tubing string to actuate the pressure responsive 

release (330) to release the coiled tubing string (320) from 
the perforating gun (322). The coiled tubing string (320) 

and pressure responsive connector (330) may then be 
retrieved from the well prior to firing the perforating gun 

(322). The perforating gun (322) is subsequently fired by a 

pressure responsive firing head (326) to perforate the well 
casing (308), and the perforating gun then automatically 

drops to the bottom of the well casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
perforating a well utilizing perforating guns conveyed into 
the well on a coiled tubing string. In the past, tubing conveyed perforating systems 
for use in completing wells have been conveyed into the 
wells on a tubing or pipe string with the string left in 
position in the well during the perforating of the well. 
After perforating of the well, the perforating guns may have 
disintegrated or may be retrieved, or may be released or 
dropped from the tubing or pipe string through the use of 
various techniques. More recently, an automatically releasing gun 
hanger has been proposed as shown in our U.S. patent 
specification no. 5,156,213. This patent describes an 
automatically releasing gun hanger which is run into the 
well on a rigid tubing string or pipe string. The gun 
hanger is set within the well by a rotating motion of the 
rigid tubing string or pipe string. The rigid tubing string 
or pipe string is then disconnected from the guns attached 
to the gun hanger through further rotational motion. The 
pipe string can then be removed from the well. The 
perforating gun is fired by a pressure actuated firing head 
and upon firing of the perforating gun, the gun hanger 
automatically releases thus allowing the guns to drop to the 
bottom of the well and leaving an unobstructed flow path 
from the perforations up through the well bore.  While there are many advantages in using an 
automatically releasable gun hanger, such as shown in the 
above U.S. patent, that particular automatically releasing 
gun hanger is not suitable for use on a coiled tubing string 
due to the fact that rotational motion is required to set 
the gun hanger and to subsequently release the tubing string 
from the gun hanger. We have now devised a method of perforating a well 
which can be run on coiled tubing. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of perforating a casing of a well, which 
method comprises: 
(a) lowering a perforating tool string into the 
casing until a perforating gun is adjacent a subsurface 
formation to be perforated; said tool string comprising a 
coiled tubing string; a perforating gun; a releasable gun 
hanger connected to said perforating gun; and a releasable 
connector connecting said coiled tubing string to said 
perforating gun; (b) actuating said gun hanger and thereby setting 
the gun hanger in the casing; (c) releasing said releasable connector from said 
perforating gun; and (d) firing the perforating gun to perforate said
