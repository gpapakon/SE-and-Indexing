<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nonwoven textile material
containing electrically conductive polytetrafluoroethylene
fibers. The nonwoven textile material may be in the form of a
felt and is useful in dissipating static electric charges. The
nonwoven textile material may be combined with a porous polymeric
membrane to form a laminate.EP 0391660 describes a membrane laminate composed of an
expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane in
conjunction with a polytetrafluoroethylene felt, in which the
felt is reinforced with a woven scrim.Control of static electricity can be of great importance in
many industrial settings where an uncontrolled electrostatic
discharge (ESD) or spark can result in serious damage. For
example, static discharges can bring about the destruction of
integrated circuits during some stages of their manufacture. In
explosive environments such as in grain elevators or in flammable
environments such as on oil drilling rigs, in refineries and in
solvent-based processes, a static discharge can be extremely
dangerous and must be prevented in order to safeguard life and
property.Organic polymeric textile materials used in these settings
can be the source of static discharges due to the normally
insulative nature of the materials and have a high value of
specific resistance, typically on the order to 1016 ohm cm, unless
the materials are altered to prevent build up of electrical
charges on their surfaces by permitting charges found on their
surfaces to drain in a controlled manner. To control static
electrical charges found in textile materials, electrical
conductivity of organic polymeric textile material may be
increased through application of antistatic finishes to the
textile material or through introduction of fibers, which have
a degree of electrical conductivity, into the textile material.
Other means for controlling static electric charges include such
external devices as grounding straps or wire, to carry electrical
charges found on the textile material to ground.Antistatic finishes are commonly applied to organic polymers 
textile materials either when the organic polymeric textile
material is in fiber form or in fabric form. These finishes
typically increase ionic conductivity of the surface on which they
are applied therein promoting static dissipation. However, these
finishes are typically not as durable as the polymeric textile
materials on which they are applied. Use and cleansing of the
organic polymeric textile material can remove these finishes from
the fabric
