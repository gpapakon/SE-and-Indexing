<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a sulfurized 
composition comprising the steps of preparing a mixture comprising (a) a fatty acid or ester, 

and (b) an olefin having from about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms, and reacting the mixture 
with sulfur and hydrogen sulfide in the presence of a catalyst and under superatmospheric 

pressure, wherein the mixture contains from about 10 to about 90 parts by weight of (a) and 
from about 10 parts to about 80 parts by weight of (b), and wherein from about 10% to 

about 70% of the sulfur is from hydrogen sulfide. The invention also relates to a sulfur 
composition comprising a hydrocarbyl sulfide, wherein from about 20% to about 90% of the 

hydrocarbyl groups are derived from a fatty acid or ester and from about 10% to about 80% 
of the hydrocarbyl groups are derived from an olefin having from about 6 to about 30 carbon 

atoms, wherein the hydrocarbyl sulfide contains from about 8% to about 15% sulfur, and has 
a neat ASTM color of less than about 4.5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sulfurized composition and method of making the 
same. In metalworking operations, the metalworking fluid is used to cool and 
lubricate the workpiece. It is advantageous for the lubricant to be light colored. Light 
colored lubricants allow easy viewing of the metalworking operation. In the past, sulfurized 
sperm oil was used widely as an additive in many lubricant formulations such as in gear oil, 
worm, and spur gears, automatic transmission fluids, waxing lubricants, and as metalworking 
additives. Sulfurized oils, such as sulfurized lard and soybean oil, replaced the sulfurized 
sperm oil and provided antiwear and lubricity properties for lubricants. U.S. Patents 3,953,347 and 3,926,822 describe compositions of matter useful 
as lubricant additives which are sulfurized compositions prepared by reacting sulfur with a 
mixture comprising at least one fatty acid ester, at least one aliphatic olefin containing about 
8 to about 36 carbon atoms and optionally, at least one fatty acid. The sulfurized 
compositions are prepared by heating such mixtures of fatty acid ester and fatty olefin with 
sulfur at temperatures of from 65°C to about 200°C. In addition to the above-described 
reagent, the reaction mixture may also include sulfurization promoters such as 
phosphorous-containing reagents such as phosphorous acid esters, and surface-active agents 
such as lecithin. An example of a phosphorous-acid ester given in these patents is 
triphenylphosphite. The preparation of synthetic sulfurized oil useful as the replacement for 
sulfurized sperm oil also is described in U.S. Patents 3,843,534; 3,825,495; 4,166,795; 
4,166,796; 4,166,797; 4,321,153; 4,456,540; and 4,487,705. The sulfurization generally 
is carried out using elemental sulfur, and simultaneous sulfurization and chlorination may be 
effected by reacting with sulfur monochloride. Phosphosulfurization is described in these 
patents and may be carried out by addition of small amounts of a phosphorus sulfide to the 
sulfurized blend followed by heating. Various compositions prepared by the sulfurization of organic compounds and 
more particularly olefins and olefin-containing compounds are known in the art, as are 
lubricants containing these products. Typical sulfurized compositions prepared by reacting 
olefins such as isobutene, diisobutene, and triisobutene with sulfur under various conditions  
 
are described in, for example, ChemicalReviews, 65, 237(1965). Other references describe 
the reaction of such olefins with
