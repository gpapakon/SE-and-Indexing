<ABSTRACT>
The brake lining for disc brakes for high speed rail vehicles comprises a carrier plate (10) on whose front side facing the friction surface of the brake disc individual braking elements (11) are arranged and on whose remote rear side there is a fixing (12) for the brake lining, at least one braking element (11) being connected to a bottom plate (112) which in turn is connected to the carrier plate (10) and projects beyond the braking element (11) laterally and/or is part of a basket (113) surrounding the braking element (11) like a jacket and open towards the front side. The bottom plate (112) of the basket (113) of the braking element (11), the said bottom plate being mounted on the carrier plate (10), is secured on the carrier plate (10) by means of a first connection (14) and, on its side facing away from the braking element (11), is secured on the carrier plate (10) by means of a second connection (13), one of the two connections (13, 14) being designed as a welded joint and the other as a mechanical connection.

Lining for disc brakes, particularly for high speed 
trains, with a one-piece or multi-part carrier plate 

(10), upon whose front facing the friction surface 
of the brake disc, individual brake elements (11) are 

disposed, in which case at least one brake element 
(11) is connected with a bottom plate (112), which, 

in turn, is connected with the carrier plate (10) 
and which projects laterally over the brake element 

and/or forms part of a cage (113) surrounding the 
brake element (11) in a casing-like fashion and which 

is open toward the face, in which case the bottom 
plate (112) of the cage (113) of the brake element 

(11) placed upon the carrier plate (10), with the 
aid of a first connection (14) and on the side facing 

away from the brake element (11), is attached 
to the carrier plate (10) with the aid of a second 

connection (13), in which case one of the two connections 
(13,14) is constructed in the form of a welded 

connection and the other connection in the form of 
a mechanical connection,
 
characterized in that
 
the carrier plate (10), upon whose opposite rear 

side an attachment or guiding means (12) for the 
brake shoe retainer is provided which is fitted with 

a plurality of circular perforations (15) centrically 
disposed relative to the brake elements and which corresponds 

to the number of brake elements (11), in 
which case each perforation (15), in comparison with 

the diameter of the brake element (11) or the bottom 
plate of the same, possesses a smaller diameter and 

is inert gas welded to the bottom plate (112), while 
the weld seam (13) is applied to the inner edge (15a) 

of each perforation (15).  
 
Lining for disc brakes, particularly for high speed 
trains, with a one-piece or multi-part carrier plate 

(10), upon whose front facing the friction surface of 
the disc brake, individual brake elements (11) are 

disposed, in which case at least one brake element 
(11) is connected with a bottom plate (112), which, 

in turn, is connected with the carrier plate (10) 
and projects laterally over the brake element and/or 

forms part of a cage (113) surrounding the brake element 
(11) in a casing-like manner and which is open 

toward the bottom plate (112) of the cage (113) of 
the brake element (11) placed upon the carrier plate 

(10), with the aid of a first connection (14) and, 
on the side facing away from the brake element (11), 

is attached to the carrier plate (10) with the aid 
of a second connection (13),
 
characterized in that,
 
on the opposite rear side of the carrier plate (10), 

an attachment or guiding means (12) for the brake shoe 
retainers is provided and in that both connections 

(13,14) are constructed in the form of welded connections, 
of which the botttom plate (112) of the cage 

(113) placed upon the carrier plate (10), both on 
its circumferential casing is at several points connected 

by means of pressure welding (14) as well as 
by means of inert gas welding (13) on its side facing 

away from the brake element (11) with the carrier plate 
(10). 
Lining according to either Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that
 
the carrier plate (10) is provided with a plurality 

of circular perforations (15) which corresponds to 
the number of the brake elements and disposed centrically 

to the brake elements, in which case each  
 

perforation (15), in comparison with the diameter of 
the brake element (11) or the bottom plate (112) of 

the same, possesses a smaller diameter and is inert 
gas welded to the bottom plate (112), while the weld 

seam (13) is applied to the inner edge (15a) of each 
perforation (15). 
Lining according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that,
 
the carrier plate 10, within the region of each perforation 

(15), possesses a plurality of wart-like bumps 
(19), which is annularly disposed around the perforation 

(15). 
Lining according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that
 
the inert gas weld seam (13) possessed a continuous 

or interrupted annular configuration and in that the 
pressure weld spots (14) are disposed equidistantly 

to each other. 
Lining according to any of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that
 
the bottom plate (112) and the all (113a) of the cage 

(113) possess a plate thickness of 0.5mm plus/minus 
0.1 mm. 
Lining according to any of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that
 
the cage casing wall (113a) is constructed in a grid 

or lattice-like form or is provided with perforations 
(114). 
Lining according to any of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterized in that
 
the bottom plate (112), within the region of the perforation 

(15) of the carrier plate (10), is constructed 
so as to be bead-like.
