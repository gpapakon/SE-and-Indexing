<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connection across a peripheral surface through a sealed 
enclosure (34A) in a radial plane between a tubing hanger (5) and a 

surrounding support member (3). The connection involves a coupling 
element (17) in the tubing hanger and a shuttle (20) which can 

reciprocate from a position wholly within the support member, across the 
interface and into electrical connection with the coupling element, 

without producing any movement of a cable (9,10,11,15) leading into a 
sealed enclosure within the support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical
connection between a radially inner and a radially outer
member, for example, in a housing assembly of a wellhead of
an oil or gas field.Electrical connections are required in housing
assemblies for high power circuits for running downhole
equipment such as pumps and heating coils, and for
electrical signals to and from downhole equipment. Such
electrical connections are conventionally made through the
top of the tubing hanger once the tubing hanger is landed
in a housing or wellhead. The space available for the
connections is therefore limited. This may result in the
production bore being off-centre which has serious
operational implications in ensuring equipment is correctly
aligned. Furthermore, the blow out preventer has to be
removed for access to the top of the tubing hanger. The
tubing hanger then provides the only barrier, which causes
a safety problem if the well is live.The electrical connection must pass through a pressure
boundary to the tubing hanger. In the case of a power
core, full insulation is needed. As good insulators have
generally poor sealing properties, sealing at the pressure
boundary at the well temperature is difficult.GB-A-2165284 discloses an assembly providing an
electrical connection across an interface between a
radially inner member and a surrounding radially outer
member, comprises a sealed enclosure between the inner and
outer members; a cable which leads to the enclosure and is
fixed and sealed to a wall of the enclosure, and which has
at least one conducting core; an electrical coupling
element within the inner member; and a shuttle which is
reciprocatable radially inwardly from a disconnected
position wholly within the outer member to a connected
position in which the shuttle makes an electrical 
connection from the conductor core to the electrical
coupling element.According to the present invention, such an assembly
is characterised in that the shuttle is filled with a dielectric
gel which is contained within a flexible bladder exposed to
the surrounding pressure; and in that a plurality of gland
type diaphragms are provided at each end of the shuttle
which seal with the conducting element and/or a conducting
element in the coupling element, or close up in the absence
of a core in order to retain the gel within the shuttle.As the connection is made across a peripheral surface
in a radial plane, it does not have to be through the top
of the inner member, e.g. a tubing hanger. Therefore the
space limitation of the prior

An assembly providing an electrical connection across
an interface between a radially inner member (5) and a

surrounding radially outer member (3), the assembly
comprising a sealed enclosure (34A) between the inner and

outer members; a cable (9,10,11,15) which leads to the

shuttle (20) is filled with a dielectric gel (26) which is

contained within a flexible bladder (25) exposed to the
surrounding pressure; and in that a plurality of gland type

diaphragms (24) are provided at each end of the shuttle
(20) which seal with the conducting element (22,22') and/or

a conducting element (19) in the coupling element (17), or
close up in the absence of a core in order to retain the

gel (26) within the shuttle.

(20) is slidable on a fixed power core (22,22') which

provides a coupling element electrically connected to the
cable core.
An assembly according to claim 2, wherein the shuttle
(20) is provided at either or both ends with a pin (42,44)

which mates, in use, with a corresponding socket (43,45) of
the respective coupling element to make the electrical

connection.
An assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
the shuttle (20) is provided at either or both ends with a 

socket (21) which mates, in use, with a corresponding pin
of the respective coupling element (18,22) to make the

electrical connection.
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein a connecting
cable (37) connected to the cable (15) is coiled within the

enclosure (34A) and is fixed to the shuttle (20).
An assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the shuttle (20), is reciprocated by

rotation of a screw threaded element (33,39) coupled to the
shuttle.

an inner member, and wherein an assembly according to any

one of the preceding claims is provided with a plurality of
connections which are circumferentially disposed about the

longitudinal axis of the tubing hanger, and have their
lines of operation offset from the axis of the tubing

hanger.
A tree assembly according to claim 7, wherein the
lines of operation are tangential to a circle centred on

the axis of the tubing hanger.
A tree assembly in which a tubing hanger (5) comprises
an inner member, and wherein an electrical connection

according to any one of claims 1 to 6 provides the
connection between the tubing hanger and the surrounding

member (5), the electrical connection providing a
connection for a plurality of cables.
