<ABSTRACT>
A key sensor incorporated in a keyboard musical 
instrument has a shutter plate (27) attached to a turnable 

key (22) and photo-interrupters (28a/28b) stationary with 
respect to a key bed (24), and the shutter plate (27) has 

an outer bottom edge (27c) and an inner bottom edge (27f) 
oblique with respect to a virtual plane (VP1) where optical 

paths of the photo-interrupters are extending so that the 
shutter plate (27) intermittently crosses the optical 

paths.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a key sensor incorporated
in a keyboard musical instrument and, more particularly, to
a key sensor of a keyboard musical instrument for producing
a digital positional signal indicative of a variable key
position.A typical example of the key sensor is implemented by
the combination of a single photo-interrupter 1 and a
shutter plate 2 with a single rectangular window 2a as
shown in figures 1A to 1C, and the shutter plate 2 is fixed
to the lower surface of a key 3 incorporated in a keyboard
musical instrument. Therefore, the shutter plate is
movable together with the key 3. On the other hand, the
photo-interrupter 1 is stationary under the shutter plate
2, and the optical path 1a is twice interrupted by the
shutter plate 2 on the way from the rest position of the
key 3 to the end position.In detail, while the key 3 is staying in the rest
position, the optical path 1a is below the lower edge 2b of
the photo-interrupter 1 as shown in figure 1A, and the 
photo-interrupter 1 converts the photo-energy into electric
current. Therefore, the electric signal produced by the
photo-interrupter 1 has a high voltage level. The electric
signal is transferred to a controller (not shown).If a player depresses the key 3, the key 3 and,
accordingly, the shutter plate 2 are downwardly moved, and
the lower portion of the shutter plate 2 interrupts the
optical path 1a as shown in figure 1B. When the
rectangular window 2a reaches the optical path, the photo-interrupter
1 restarts the conversion from the photo-energy
to the electric current, and the electric signal goes up to
the high voltage level. The photo-interrupter 1 keeps the
electric signal in the high voltage level while the
rectangular window 2a is transferring the optical path 2a.Finally, when the key 3 reaches the end position, the
upper portion of the shutter plate 2 interrupts the optical
path 1a as shown in figure 1C, and the electric signal goes
down to the low voltage level again.Thus, the electric signal is changed from the high
voltage level through the low voltage level to the high
voltage level, and finally goes down to the low voltage
level along the downward motion of the key 3. However, the
electric signal only indicates the interruption and the 
non-interruption, and the controller can not discriminate
the rest position shown in figure 1A from the position
allowing the optical path 1a through the rectangular window
2a and the position shown in figure 1B from the end
position shown in figure 1C. In short, the prior art key
sensor
