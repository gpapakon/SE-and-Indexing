<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a composite material in which a fibre matt is placed adjacent a plate electrode in ceramic sol. The application of an electric field to the sol via the electrode results in the deposition of sol particles on the electrode which subsequently permeate the fibre matt. The permeated fibre matt is then removed from the sol, dried out and heated to sinter the sol particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
a composite material and is particularly concerned with a 
method of manufacturing a composite material using 
electrophoresis. It is well known that certain characteristics of 
some materials can be enhanced by reinforcing those 
materials with a suitably configured structure formed 
from a different material. In a typical example, the 
strength characteristics of one material can be enhanced 
by reinforcing that material with fibres of a different 
suitably strong material. In the field of ceramics it is frequently desirable 
to reinforce a ceramic matrix material with high strength 
fibres of,' for instance, alumina or silicon carbide. 
Difficulties arise, however, in ensuring that the 
reinforcing fibres are completely infiltrated by the 
ceramic matrix material. One method of infiltrating reinforcing fibres with a 
ceramic matrix material is by the use of chemical vapour 
infiltration. In that technique the fibres are placed in 
an atmosphere of a suitable vapour which is caused to 
chemically break down to deposit a ceramic material on 
the fibres. Ceramics such as silicon carbide can be 
deposited in this way. However it is a slow process 
which is expensive to carry out. In addition it does 
have a tendency to produce a matrix material which has 
some degree of undesirable porosity. Another technique is one which utilises liquid phase 
reaction. This involves infiltrating the reinforcing 
fibres with a liquid which progressively oxidises or 
reacts with a gaseous atmosphere to form a ceramic matrix 
material. For instance, the fibres could be infiltrated 
by molten aluminium which is caused to oxidise to alumina 
as it infiltrates. The drawback with this technique is that there is 
only a small range of materials which are suitable for  
 
use with it. Additionally there is the danger that 
unreacted metal could be left in the matrix material. 
Additionally the matrix material does tend to exhibit a 
certain degree of porosity. A still further technique is one in which the 
reinforcing fibres are infiltrated with a liquid glass 
precursor material which is subsequently crystallised to 
form a ceramic product. The difficulty with this technique is that of the 
limited range of glass precursor materials which are 
available It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a method of manufacturing a composite material in which 
such difficulties are substantially avoided. According to the present invention, a method of 
manufacturing a

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a composite material 
characterised in that said method comprises the steps of 

placing a porous reinforcing medium adjacent an electrode 
generally corresponding in shape with said porous 

reinforcing medium, immersing said electrode and said 
porous reinforcing medium in a suspension of ceramic 

particles, each of said ceramic particles carrying a 
surface charge, applying an electric field to said 

suspension sufficient to cause said ceramic particles to 
migrate to said electrode through said porous reinforcing 

medium and continuing the application of said electric 
field until ceramic particles attracted to said electrode 

are deposited thereon to such a depth that said deposited 
particles additionally substantially completely permeate 

said porous reinforcing medium, discontinuing said 
electric field, taking steps to ensure that said 

permeated ceramic particles remain in position within 
said porous reinforcing medium after the discontinuation 

of said electric field, removing said permeated porous 
medium from said electrode and from said suspension of 

ceramic particles and subsequently sintering said 
permeated ceramic particles within said porous 

reinforcing medium. 
A method of manufacturing a composite material as 
claimed in claim 1 characterised in that a coating of 

said ceramic particles is initially applied to said 
electrode, said porous reinforcing medium being attached 

to said applied coating so as to be adjacent said 
electrode prior to said permeation of said porous 

reinforcing medium. 
A method of manufacturing a composite material as 
claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that said 

porous reinforcing medium comprises fibres. 
A method of manufacturing a composite material as 
claimed in claim 3 characterised in that said fibres are 

woven.  
 
A method of manufacturing a composite material as 
claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 characterised in that said 

fibres are ceramic.

claimed in claim 5 characterised in that said fibres are

A method of manufacturing a composite material as 
claimed in any one preceding claim characterised in that 

said suspension of ceramic particles is a sol. 
A method of manufacturing a composite material as 
claimed in claim 7 wherein said sol is a silica sol. 
A method of manufacturing a composite material as 
claimed in claim 7 or claim 8 characterised in that said

A method of manufacturing a composite material as 
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in that 

said suspension additionally contains a binder which is 
co-deposited with said ceramic particles so as to ensure 

that said permeated ceramic particles remain in position 
within said porous reinforcing medium.
