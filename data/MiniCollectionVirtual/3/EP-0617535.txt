<ABSTRACT>
A mounting assembly for a radio telephone handset has a 
body portion (1) and a loudspeaker (10) mounted therein 

for use in "hands-free" mode. A holder (2) is provided 
for securely but releasably holding the handset and said 

holder is detachably mounted on the body portion. The 
said body portion includes a recess adapted to receive 

and secure a portion of the holder. 
The handset may be indirectly securably attached to the 
body portion or, using the same holder, it may be mounted 

elsewhere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mounting assembly for 
a radio telephone. The usefulness of a radio telephone such as a portable or 
mobile cellular telephone may be enhanced by the use of 
a handsfree mode which enables the user to operate the 
telephone while performing another task. Mounting assemblies which facilitate handsfree operation 
are particularly useful in vehicles where the arrangement 
enables a driver to carry on a telephone conversation 
while allowing both hands to be used to control the 
vehicle. When a call is received or transmitted, with the radio 
telephone handset mounted in the handsfree arrangement 
holder, the handsfree arrangement loudspeaker and 
microphone operate in place of the telephone loudspeaker 
(earpiece) and microphone (mouthpiece). The telephone 
handset is arranged to sense the presence of the holder 
and automatically switches from telephone handset mode, 
in which the handset loudspeaker and microphone operate, 
to a handsfree mode, in which the handsfree arrangement 
loudspeaker and microphone operate. When the telephone 
handset does not sense the presence of the holder, i.e. 
when the handset has been removed from the holder by a 
user, the telephone handset automatically switches from 
handsfree mode to telephone mode. Two types of handsfree arrangement are known. A first 
type comprises a distinct microphone and a one-piece 
housing having a loudspeaker and a telephone holder for 
a telephone handset. This type of handsfree arrangement  
 
may be used as the cradle for a handset of a mobile 
telephone intended for installation in a vehicle. The 
handsfree arrangement may also comprise a connector for 
an external antenna and a connector for a microphone. A second type of handsfree arrangement comprises a body 
arranged to have a loudspeaker and a separate holder for 
a telephone handset. The body and the holder are 
physically separate and therefore require more surface 
space in the vehicle interior. This type of handsfree 
arrangement is also more difficult to install due to the 
additional number of separate parts. The choice between a one-piece handsfree arrangement or 
a body and holder combination may be determined by the 
available space in the vehicle interior as well as 
variable criteria such as whether or not the one-piece 
hands free arrangement or the components of the body and 
holder combination will obstruct a load to be carried by 
the vehicle. However, neither arrangement provides any 
flexibility when the variable criteria may change
