species of sponge (1 Kg) collected in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. 
This sponge, designated herein as Mycale N.sp2, was collected 
specifically at a depth of 22 meters from the South/West face of 
Fergusson Island in Doubtful Sound, at 4° 22'10S, 167° 04'20E. The 
sponge collected had the following taxonomic characteristics: 
Phylum:Porifera Class:Demospongia, Sollas Order:Poecilosclerida, Topsent Family:Mycalidae, Lundbeck Genus:Mycale - now called Carmia (synonymous) Species:N.sp2 One specimen was analyzed; it had small spicules, strongly bent 
anisochelae were distinctive and separate this species from know 
species of Mycale. N.sp2 is found throughout Fiordland, but is not 
common. The sponge is soft and has a range of external colors from 
purple to dull yellow. It is yellow internally and easy torn. In
