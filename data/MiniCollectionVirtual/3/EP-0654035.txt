<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward phosphonoacetic esters, acids, and their 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are characterized by (Formula I) and which are useful as 
anti-inflammatories and anti-arthritic agents. The present compounds are useful to prepare medicaments for humans and lower animals as a safe and effective 
treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal phosphate and calcium metabolism, and as a 
treatment of inflammation. These diseases include osteoporosis, Paget's disease, periodontal 
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, neuritis, bursitis, soft tissue mineral disorders, ankylosing 
spondylitis, atherosclerosis, multiple myeloma of bone, metastatic bone disease, and mitral valve 
calcification. For state of the art purposes, US Patent 4,746,654 discloses bisphosphonates useful as anti-inflammatory 
agents; Australian Patent A-51534/85 discloses bisphosphonates useful in treating 
abnormal calcium and phosphorous metabolism and useful in treating arthritis; and US Patent 
3,683,080 discloses polyphosphonates, in particular diphosphonates useful in inhibiting anomalous 
deposition and mobilization of calcium phosphate in animal tissue. In one aspect, the present invention is phosphonoacetic esters, acids, and its 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are structurally represented by Formula I 
 
wherein R1 is H, C1-C6, alkyl, benzyl, phenyl, phenyl (substituted with 1 to 5 F, Cl, Br, I, NO2, 
OCH3 or C1-C4 alkyl); 
   R2 is H, C1-C6 alkyl, benzyl, phenyl, phenyl (substituted with 1 to 5 F, Cl, Br, I, NO2, OCH3 
or C1-C4 alkyl), or where both R2's are taken together and form a CH2-CH2, CH2-CH2-CH2 or CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 
to form a heterocyclic ring containing the bonded P atom and two O atoms;  
 
one of X or Y is H and the other is selected from: 
 
   or X and Y are taken together to form a ring selected from: 
In another aspect, the present invention comprises the use of these compounds to prepare a medicament useful in humans 
and lower animals as a safe and effective treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. These 
diseases include periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, pneumoconioses, Crohn's 
disease, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, chronic asthma, atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and 
sarcoidosis. Routes of administration include oral, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, 
intra-articular, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal. An effective amount is an amount whereby the 
symptoms of inflammation or arthritis such as pain and
