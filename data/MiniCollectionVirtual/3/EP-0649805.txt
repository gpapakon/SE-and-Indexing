<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a gripper (5) for a device for the removal of cases (11) open at the top and stacked on a pallet, in particular drinks cases, with a crossmember (3) which extends over the entire width of the pallet and on which a gripping device is arranged. The gripping device has a gripper head (4), of which the spacing in the longitudinal direction of the crossmember (3) can be adjusted in a flexible manner, and each gripper head is equipped with a finger-like or lamellar gripper (5) for fixing the case (11) to be picked up and with a detection sensor assembly for detecting the uppermost row of cases. The gripper (5) has gripping jaws which are formed by axially resilient gripping fingers (6) movable in the direction of the gripping force and by at least one pressure strip (8) movable in the direction of the gripping force.

A gripper for a device for removing crates which 
are open at the top and which are stacked on a pallet 

or the like, more particularly crates of drinks, with a 
cross-member (3) extending over the entire width of the 

pallet, on which cross-member a gripper device is 
disposed, the gripper device having gripper heads (4), 

the spacing of which in the longitudinal direction of 
the cross-member (3) is flexibly adjustable, and each 

gripper head (4) is provided with a gripper (5) in the 
form of a finger or blade for fixing the crate (11) to 

be accommodated, and with a recognition sensor system 
for recognising the top line of the crate,
 
characterised in that the gripper (5) has gripper jaws 

formed by gripper fingers (6) movable in the direction 
of the gripping force and flexible axially, i.e. in 

their longitudinal direction, and by at least one 
pressure strip (8) movable in the direction of the 

gripping force. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the gripper fingers (6) have entry bevels (14) at 

their ends. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the gripper fingers (6) are guided in axial 

guide bushes (9). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the gripper fingers (6) are 

additionally guided in radial guide bushes (10).  
 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a drive cylinder (15) and 

a return spring (12) are associated with each gripper 
finger (6). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a drive cylinder (15) is 

associated with each pressure strip (8). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the pressure strips (8) 

are guided in a guide bush (14). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a plurality of pressure 

strips (8) are provided and are pivotally 
interconnected. 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the pressure strips (8) 

are provided with a coating (17) of elastic material at 
their sides facing the crates (11) for gripping.
