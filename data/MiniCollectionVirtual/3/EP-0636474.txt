<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a process for preparing laminates of at 
least one layer of a polyolefin and at least one layer of 

polyurethane and/or polyisocyanurate, comprising applying an 
interpolymer coating on at least one side of said layer of the 

polyolefin, and preparing said layer of the polyurethane and/or 
polyisocyanurate on top of said interpolymer coating, wherein the 

interpolymer coating is composed of an interpolymer prepared by 
bulk, solution, suspension or emulsion polymerisation of a monomer 

mixture that has an average solubility parameter δ of less than 
8.1, preferably less than 8.05.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for preparing laminates of
at least one layer of a polyolefin and at least one layer of a
polyurethane and/or polyisocyanurate. More specifically, the
invention relates to a process for preparing laminates of at least
one layer of a polyolefin such as polypropylene, and at least one
layer of polyurethane and/or polyisocyanurate foam. In addition,
the invention relates to the laminates so prepared.Polyolefins, particularly polypropylene, have become the most
commonly used plastic material in both household and industrial
applications. This is due to their outstanding performance at
relatively low cost. One of the many applications of polypropylene
is as base layer for laminates. These laminates, obtained by
co-extrusion, combine properties from the polyolefin layer and the
material attached thereto.For instance, polypropylene could be used to replace toughened
polystyrene or ABS that is customary employed as lining material in
refrigerator. It was found that the original materials could be
detrimentally affected by the environmentally more friendly blowing
agents (HCFC's, low (cyclo)hydrocarbons) replacing the much
objected CFC's. A setback of polyolefins is that, due to their
inert surfaces, they cannot be bonded readily to other (polar)
materials, in particular not to polyurethane and/or
polyisocyanurate. Also in other areas, such as manufacture of
high-tech sport shoes, the production of insulated pipes and in
automotive applications, this problem of adhesion between
polyolefins and polyurethane can be found.In the art, various surface treatments such as flame
oxidation, corona discharge and chemical etching have been proposed
with some measure of success to improve the bonding between inert 
polyolefins and polar materials. Furthermore, it is
known to use pressure-sensitive adhesives, such as
disclosed in US-A-3,258,443 or combinations of tiecoats
and adhesive topcoats such as disclosed in
EP-A-0018847.In particular, the latter document (see for
instance example 11) provides polypropylene-polyurethane
foam laminates with a remarkable tear
strength. The process described consists of applying a
tiecoat on the polypropylene and a pressure-sensitive
topcoat on pre-foamed polyurethane panels and pressing
both materials together. This process is inconvenient
in many applications and particularly unrealisable for
domestic appliances where foam has to be expanded in-situ.Purpose of the present invention is to provide a
more efficient process for preparing laminates of at
