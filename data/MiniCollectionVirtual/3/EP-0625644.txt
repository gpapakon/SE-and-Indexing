<ABSTRACT>
A fastener 10, 12 includes an annular body 18, 20 having a screw thread 14, 16 
spiraling therearound. The thread 14, 16 has a crest 14a, 1 6a and a pair of front and back 

flanks 14b,c, 16b,c extending laterally therefrom, with a start end 26a,b disposed adjacent 
to a front end 18a, 20a of the body. The start end 26a,b is flat 

from the back flank 14c, 
16c to the front flank 14b, 16c and is inclined at an acute back angle relative to a helical 

axis 24a,b of the crest 14a, 16a for facing the start end 26a,b toward a back 
end 18b, 20b 

of the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to remote engagement of fastener 
components, and, more specifically, to a fastener having improved alignment and 
engagement features. In the environment of a nuclear reactor such as a boiling water reactor (BWR) for 
example, components within the reactor pressure vessel are located at a substantial 
distance below the top thereof and underwater when flooded during maintenance 
operations. Reactor components are typically assembled and disassembled by remote 
manipulation through the water to provide maximum shielding and distance from the 
radioactive environment adjacent the nuclear reactor core. Threaded fasteners such as bolts and nuts are often used for assembling together 
components within the reactor. The engagement thereof is relatively difficult since limited 
access is typically provided in the crowded reactor pressure vessel and due to the flexibility 
of the remote handling tools which may extend up to about 25 meters below the operator 
and through the water. A typical conventional bolt has a thread with a blunt or tapered start or leading edge 
for engaging with the respective leading edge or start end of the nut, see eg. DE-C-73597. The nut and bolt 
must be suitably initially axially aligned with each other with the respective threads being 
disposed closely adjacent to each other within a relatively small percentage of the thread 
pitch, for example about 5%, to ensure effective mating of the threads as they are rotated 
into engagement. Other configurations of the bolt front end are also conventionally known 
for more accurately initially joining together the bolt to the nut without damaging the 
threads due to misalignment or cross-threading thereof. However, conventional 
configurations vary in effectiveness and vary in their ability to be assembled using remote 
robotic or manipulation devices such as those required in the environment of the BWR for 
engagement at a substantial distance underwater.  
 A fastener includes an annular body having a screw thread spiraling therearound. 
The thread has a crest and a pair of front and back flanks extending laterally therefrom, 
with a start end disposed adjacent to a front end of the body. The start end is flat from the 
back flank to the front flank and is inclined at an acute back angle relative to a helical axis 
of the crest for facing the start end toward a back end of the body. The invention, in accordance with preferred and exemplary embodiments, together 
with further objects and
