<ABSTRACT>
A first through hole (95a,95b) is formed into a shape such that 
the opening area at the start of the opening increases 

gradually along with the movement of a piston valve (56) or an 
auxiliary through hole (96a,96b) is provided in a cylinder (54) to 

introduce the gas being compressed into a suction-side 
chamber by being opened by the piston valve (56) before the first 

through hole is opened, so that the gas being compressed is 
prevented from suddenly entering the suction-side chamber 

when piston valve moves in the cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement of a 
capacity control mechanism for a scroll-type compressor. One example of the scroll-type compressor of the related 
art is shown in Figs.7 through 13. In Fig.7, reference numeral 1 denotes a housing. The 
housing 1 comprises a cup-shaped body 2, a front end plate 4 
fastened to the cup-shaped body 2 with bolts 3, and a 
cylindrical member 6 fastened to the front end plate 4 with 
bolts 5. A main shaft 7 passing through the cylindrical 
member 6 is rotatably supported by the housing 1 via 
bearings 8 and 9. The housing 1 incorporates a fixed scroll 10 and a 
rotary scroll 14. The fixed scroll 10 has an end plate 11 and a spiral 
lap 12 installed on the inner surface of the end plate 11. A 
discharge port 29 is disposed at the center of the end plate 
11 and a pair of bypass ports 33a, 33b communicating with 
compression chambers 19a and 19b during compression are also 
disposed.  
 The rotary scroll has an end plate 15 and a spiral lap 
16 installed on the inner surface of the end plate 15. The 
shape of the spiral lap 16 is substantially the same as that 
of the spiral lap 12 of the fixed scroll 10. The rotary scroll 14 and the fixed scroll 10 are off-centered 
mutually by the radius of revolution and engaged 
with each other at a shifted angle of 180Â° as shown in the 
figure. A tip seal 17 embedded in the tip end of spiral lap 12 
is in contact with the inner surface of the end plate 15, 
while the tip seal 18 embedded in the tip end of spiral lap 
16 is in contact with the inner surface of the end plate 11. 
The side surfaces of the spiral laps 12 and 16 are in linear 
contact with each other at a plurality of places, and a 
plurality of compression chambers 19a, 19b which are 
symmetric with respect to the center of spiral are formed. Inside a cylindrical boss 20 extending at the center of 
the outer surface of the end plate 15, a drive bushing 21 is 
rotatably fitted via a bearing 23. In an eccentric bore 24 
made in the drive bushing 21, an eccentric pin 25 extending 
eccentrically from the inner end of the main shaft 7 is 
rotatably inserted. To this drive bushing 21 is installed a 
balance weight 27. Between the outer periphery of outer surface of the end 
plate 15 and the inner surface of the front end plate 4, a  
 
rotation inhibiting mechanism 40, which is also used as a 
thrust bearing, is disposed. A capacity control block 50 is installed in such a 
manner as to be in contact with the outer surface of the end 
plate 11 of the fixed scroll 10.

<CLAIMS>
A capacity control mechanism for a scroll-type 
compressor comprising a control pressure chamber 

in which a control pressure developed by a control 
valve (58) is introduced to one side of a piston 

valve (56) by fitting said piston valve (56) 
sealingly and slidably in a cylinder (54), a suction-side 

chamber (81) which communicates with a suction 
chamber on the other side of said piston valve (56), 

a first through hole (95a, 95b) which introduces 
the gas being compressed in the cylinder (54) to 

said suction-side chamber (81), and a second through 
hole (92) which introduces the compressed gas to 

said suction-side chamber (81), said first and second 
through holes being opened in that order by the 

movement of said piston valve (56) in said cylinder 
(54) along with the decrease in said control pressure,
 
characterized in that said first through hole is 

shaped so that the opening area at the start of the 
opening gradually increases during the movement of 

said piston (56) and that an auxiliary through hole 
(96a, 96b) is provided, in said cylinder (54), said 

auxiliary through hole (96a, 96b) having a smaller 
opening area than said first through hole and being 

opened by said piston valve (56) before said first 
through hole is opened in order to introduces the 

gas being compressed into said suction-side chamber 
(81).  

 
A capacity control mechanism for a scroll-type 
compressor according to claim (1)
 
characterized in that
 
said first through hole (95a, 95b) is formed into 

a substantially triangular shape. 
A capacity control mechanism for a scroll-type 
compressor according to claim (1)
 
characterized in that
 
said first through hole is formed by a plurality 

of holes.
