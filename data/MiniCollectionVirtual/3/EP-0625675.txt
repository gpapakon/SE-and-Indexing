<ABSTRACT>
A roller grate, in particular for refuse-incinerating plants, comprises cylindrical, hollow grate rollers (1) which are arranged one beside the other in an axis-parallel manner along an inclined plane (3) and between which an interspace is maintained. Arranged in the interspace are strippers (5) which are fastened on a stripper carrier (6) arranged beneath the interspace. Arranged beneath the strippers (5) are additional sealing elements (11) which are mounted pivotably and are pressed resiliently over the entire length against the grate roller (1).

Roller grate for combustion installations, especially waste 
incineration plants, with cylinder-shaped hollow grate rollers (1), which 

are arranged adjacent to one another and axially parallel along an 
inclined plane (3) and between which there is preserved an intermediate 

space in which strippers (5) are arranged, which are fastened on a 
stripper carrier (6) arranged below the intermediate space, characterised 

thereby that sealing elements (11), which are pivotably mounted and 
resiliently pressed over the entire length against the grate rollers 

(11), are arranged below the strippers (5). 
Roller grate according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
sealing elements (11) are pressed against the grate rollers (1) by 

pivotably mounted spring elements. 
Roller grate according to claim 1, characterised thereby that each 
sealing element (11) consists of several individually resiliently 

supported plates disposed closely alongside one another. 
Grate roller according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby 
that the spring elements consist of leaf springs (15), which are 

connected with a shaft (16) to be secure against rotation and each 
slidingly guided in a respective mount (13) which is fastened on the 

sealing element (11) on the side remote from the grate roller (1). 
Grate roller according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby 
that a cover (19) is provided between the pivotably mounted sealing 

element (11) and the stripper carrier (6) and is fixedly fastened to the 
stripper carrier (6).
