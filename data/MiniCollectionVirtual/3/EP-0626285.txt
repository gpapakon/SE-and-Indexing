<CLAIMS>
A sealing joint for a motor vehicle body, made of rubber or 
elastomer and comprising a strip or layer (18) of adhesive 

material for fixing it to a support as well as a longitudinal 
layer or strip (20) of non-extensible, meshed material which is 

embedded in the rubber or elastomer of the joint and 
substantially preventing elongation of the joint when it is fixed 

to the support, characterized in that it is made of cellular 
rubber or elastomer and in that said layer or strip (20) of non-extensible 

material is wide-meshed thus ensuring attachment with 
the joint cellular material by the material going through the 

above-mentioned mesh. 
A joint according to Claim 1, characterized in that said 
layer or strip (20) of non-extensible material extends parallel 

to the above-mentioned strip or layer (18) of adhesive material. 
A joint according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said layer or strip (20) of non-extensible 

material extends in the direction of the length of the joint, 
substantially in the centre of the latter. 
A joint according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said layer or strip (20) of non-extensible 

material is a strip of woven or braided textile material. 
A joint according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the layer or strip (20) of non-extensible 

material is incorporated into the joint when the latter is 
manufactured by extrusion. 
A joint according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the size of the mesh of said layer or strip 

(20) of non-extensible material is between one and a few 
millimetres or more.
