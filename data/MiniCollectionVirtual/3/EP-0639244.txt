<ABSTRACT>
In order to simplify the manufacture of a roller bearing (1) in which a cylindrical roller (14) is mounted on a central shaft (3) which extends out beyond the ends of the roller (14) and whose ends (4, 5) are fitted in a mounting (8), the invention proposes that at least the end zones of the shaft (3) are hollow and that at least part of the wall (11) of the cavity thus formed is secured in position against the outer surface (12) of the mounting (8) by bending it round or beading it over. This avoids the need for a split pin to secure the shaft (3).

<CLAIMS>
Roller bearing with a supporting shaft (3) which centrally 
and rotatably carries a cylindrical roller (14), extends 

beyond the roller (14) on either side and whose ends (4, 
5) are fitted in a mounting (8), wherein at least the end 

zones (4, 5) of the shaft (3) are of hollow design, 

characterised in that
 the wall (11) of 
the cavity is secured in position against the outer 

surface (12) of the mounting (8) by bending it round or 
beading it over, wherein the end zones (4, 5) of the shaft 

are concentrically bent outwards against the outer surface 
(12) of the mounting (8). 
Roller bearing as per Claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 the shaft (3) is designed as a tube with end 
zones (4, 5) bent round against the outer surface (12) of 

the mounting (8). 
Roller bearing as per one of the Claims 1 or 2, 

characterised in that
 one or more 
spacers (17) are arranged between the inner surface (15) 

of the mounting (8) and the face end (16) of the roller 
(14).
