<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of electroconductive, infrared-reflective layers (coatings) on glass, glass-ceramic or enamel surfaces by spraying and thermal decomposition of liquid preparations containing Sn(IV) compounds and fluorine compounds as dopants (dopes) onto the surfaces heated to from 400 to 800 DEG C, but below their softening point, where the liquid preparations used are ionically stabilized organotin(IV) acid sols containing, as liquid organic medium, aliphatic alcohols or ketones, in each case having at most 6 carbon atoms in a molecule, or esters having a boiling point of 
<
 180 DEG C and fluorine ions in an amount sufficient for doping. The preparations are homogeneous, have a long shelf life and can be readily diluted with alcohols, ketones, esters and other polar solvents. The tin oxide layers produced on the substrates by means of the preparations have high transparency in the visible wavelengths region of light, low surface resistance and high reflection in the infrared wavelength region.
