<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a metallic magnetic powder with 

which one can produce magnetic media for high-density 
recording that are improved in storage stability and 

magnetic characteristics. 
The improved ferromagnetic metal powder contains 
no more than 0.05 wt% of an element of Group Ia of the 

periodic table. The powder may optionally contain 0.1 - 
30 atm% of aluminum and/or 0.1 - 10 atm% of Y or any 

other rare earth element based on the total quantity of 
the metal elements present. In either of these cases, 

the residue of an element of Group IIa of the periodic 
table is preferably 0.1 wt% or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ferromagnetic
metal powder and a magnetic recording medium according to the prior art portion of claims 1 and 5, suitable as a constitutional material for
the magnetic layer of magnetic recording media such as
magnetic tapes and disks.As a result of the increase in recording density,
magnetic recording media such as magnetic tapes and
disks for use in audio, video and computer technologies
have become increasingly smaller in size and better in
performance and the magnetic powders for such recording
media are accordingly shifting from the conventional
iron oxide systems to metallic magnetic powders having
higher coercive force and saturation magnetization.The metallic magnetic powders for use in high-density
magnetic recording applications are based
typically on iron but sometimes on metals such as Ni
and Co.The common industrial process for the manufacture
of iron base magnetic powders starts with iron
oxyhydroxide or iron oxide-based acicular particles and
consists of having an anti-sintering agent such as Si,
Al, Zr or Ca deposited or adsorbed on the needles and
thereafter reducing them with heat.When synthesizing iron oxyhydroxide- or iron oxide-based
compounds on an industrial scale, compounds of
elements of Group Ia of the periodic table such as
NaOH, Na2CO3 and KOH have been used as neutralizing
agents for the principal reasons of low price and ease
in handling. This has eventually produced metallic
magnetic powders in which elements of Group Ia of the
periodic table such as Na and K more or less remain as
incidental impurities on the surfaces of the particles.This is also true with elements of Group IIa of
the periodic table. As taught in Examined Japanese
Patent Publication (kokoku) Sho 59-32882 and Unexamined
Published Japanese Patent Application (kokai) Hei 2-107701, 
those elements are occasionally used as anti-sintering
agents or the like, which eventually remain
on the metallic magnetic powders produced.Ferromagnetic metal powders consisting of iron, nickel or cobalt are
known from US-A-4 054 530 and EP-A-0 433 894.The present invention has been accomplished under
these circumstances and has as the principal object
achieving further improvements in the quality of
magnetic media for high-density recording by using
ferromagnetic metal powders having better magnetic
characteristics and dispersibility, as well as assuring
higher storage stability for the magnetic layer.According to the present invention,
the ferromagnetic metal powder and recording media are
