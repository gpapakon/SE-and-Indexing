<ABSTRACT>
the method involves using a centring pin (3) axially displaceable in a vice and clamped during at least one machining step in the gripper of the vice chuck (1) so that the workpiece is held central at its end facing the chuck of the vice. During a machining step the rotation of the chuck is transferred to the workpiece through a follower. Independent claim describes chuck with at least one displaceable centring pin which in its position furthest forward on the workpiece lies in the grip area of the chuck gripper.

Chuck for a machine tool having one machine
head or having two machine heads facing each other for

machining of a workpiece, wherein the chuck comprises at
least one centering pin journalled centrally in the chuck

and displaceable along its rotation axis, which in its
furthest in direction to the workpiece to be machined

pushed position is located within the gripping area of
the chuck and in its furthest in opposite direction

retracted position is located outside of said gripping
area, charcterized in that the centering pin is journalled

in at least one expanding clamping sleeve.
Chuck according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the centering pin is displaceable by means of an
automatic control system.
Chuck according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the jaws of its tongs at a
first location are shaped for gripping the centering pin

and at a second location, which is axially displaced with
respect to the first one, are shaped for gripping the

workpiece.
Method for machining a workpiece on a machine
tool equipped with the chuck according to one of

the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the workpiece,
at least during one machining step, is, at its end

which is facing the chuck, centrically held by the centering
pin, wherein the centering pin is clamped in the

jaws of the chuck and the at least one expanding clamping
sleeve is expanded for providing additional support to

the centering pin.
Method according to claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 a machine tool having two chucks according to one
of the claims 1 to 3 is used, wherein the workpiece during

at least one machining step, respectively, is centrically
held at its end facing the respective chuck by 

the centering pin, wherein the centering pin is clamped
in the jaws of the res
pective chuck and the at least one
expanding clamping sleeve of the respective chuck is expanded

for providing additional support to the centering
pin.
Method according to one of the claims 4 or
5, 
characterized in that
, during said one machining step,
the rotation of one chuck is transferred to the workpiece

by means of a dog which is connected to said chuck.
Method according to one of the claims 4 or
5, 
characterized in that
 the rotation of the workpiece,
during said one machining step, is generated in a manner

which is mechanically independent from the rotation of
the chuck.
Method according to claim 7, 
characterised
in that
, during said one machining step, at least one
chuck is at standstill.
Method according to one of the claims 4 to
8, 
characterised in that
, during at least one other machining
step of the workpiece, at least one centering pin

is free from the associated tongs and is retracted behind
them, and that the tongs then clamp the workpiece.
Method according to claim 9, 
characterized
in that
 those part of the jaws of at least one set of
tongs, which during said one step clamps the centering

pin, is different from the one which during said other
step clamps the workpiece.
Method according to one of the claims 4
to 10, 
characterized in that
 said one machining step comprises
the machining of a part of the workpiece, which is

located nearer to the respective chuck than the part of
the workpiece which is machined in said other machining

step.
Method according to one of the claims 4
to 11, 
characterized in that
 said one machine step is
performed first and said other is performed later, and

that the tongs clamp the workpiece during the later step 
at a location which has been machined during the earlier

step.
Method according to one of the claims 9
to 12, 
characterised in that
 the work piece, during at
least a part of the change over between said one and said

other machining step, on at least one end is supported by
a centering pin by pressing same against said end.
Method according to one of the claims 4
to 13, 
characterized in that
 said at least one centering
pin is hydraulically or pneumatically moved in direction

of the rotating axis of the chuck.
