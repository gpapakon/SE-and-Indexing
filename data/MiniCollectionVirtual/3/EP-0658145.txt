<DESCRIPTION>
 Sheet for use in Thermal Transfer PrintingThis invention relates to a sheet for use in thermal transfer printing (TTP) and especially to a TTP sheet having a sublayer between a substrate and a surface coat. Thermal transfer printing is a printing process in which a dye is caused, by thermal stimuli, to transfer from a dye sheet to a receiver sheet. In such processes, the dye sheet and receiver sheet are placed in intimate contact, the thermal stimuli are applied to the dye sheet and the dye sheet and receiver sheet are then separated. By applying the thermal stimuli to pre-determined areas in the dye sheet, the dye is selectively transferred to the receiver to form the desired image.Receiver sheets conventionally comprise a substrate with a dye-receiving surface on one side, into which a dye is thermally transferable and retainable. The dye-receiving surface typically comprises a receiver layer specifically tailored to receive the dye which is coated onto the substrate. Dye-sheets conventionally comprise a substrate having on one surface thereof a dye coat which typically comprises a thermally transferable dye dispersed in a binder. Both receiver sheets and dye sheets may also comprise a backcoat on the opposite surface to the receiver layer or the dye coat respectively which is typically employed to impart desirable characteristics to the sheet for example good handling properties.It is desirable that receiver sheets and dye sheets possess good anti-static characteristics otherwise problems for example, jamming of the sheets in the printing apparatus, and other handling problems may occur due to charge build up on the receiver sheet and/or the dye sheet.TTP sheets having suitable anti-static properties have been produced by employing an ionic material in a surface coat for example, a receiver layer, a dye coat and a backcoat. However ionic materials are dependent on the presence of moisture to function as anti-static agents as a consequence of which the anti static performance may vary with a change in the humidity of the environment. Carbon black has been employed in dye sheets to act as an absorber of light in light induced thermal transfer processes however this material is unacceptable for use in receiver layers as an anti-static agent due to its colour. 

 We have now found that by employing an electro-conducting material below a surface coat of a dye and/or receiver sheet, a TTP sheet having excellent anti-static properties which are substantially independent of environmental humidity may be
