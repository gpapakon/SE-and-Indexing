<ABSTRACT>
A plastic closure for sealing containers which have 
been filled with contents that are hot or which are to be 

retorted. The closure is made of thermosetting or thermoplastic 
material. The closure includes a base wall and a peripheral 

skirt. The skirt is formed for engaging a container. The base 
wall of the closure having an inner surface with a liner thereon. 

A reactive hot melt adhesive bonds the liner to the inner 
surface. The reactive hot melt adhesive is cross-linkable such 

that after the liner is applied and the adhesive cures, the 
adhesive bonds the liner to the inner surface of the base wall 

of the closure such that the liner will withstand and resist 
deformation under vacuum caused by cooling of the hot contents 

in a container or caused by retorting the contents of a container 
and subsequent cooling. The reactive hot melt adhesive may be 

a cross-linkable adhesive selected from the group consisting 
of polyurethane and silicone. The liner being adhered may be 

made of ethylene, polypropylene, α-olefin copolymers, i.e. 
ethylene-octane, propylene-ethylene or butylene-ethylene and 

SBR rubber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plastic closures utilized 
for hot fill and retort applications. Plastic closures with sealing liners for glass and 
plastic containers may be classified as follows: 
1. Adhesives for liner/glass interface - These include 
adhesives applied to the side of the liner which under heat, 
bonds to the container finish to generally impart tamper 
indication. Patents in this category are 4,684,554 and 
4,778,698. 2. Laminating Adhesives - Adhesives in this type 
consist of adhesives for bonding two or more films together to 
form a liner composition. They do not bond the liner to the 
closure shell interface. Patent 4,961,986 mentions use of a 
water borne urethane utilized as a laminating adhesive. Other 
patents utilize thermoplastic adhesives such as 4,961,986, 
2,263,693, 3,866,845, 4,818,577 and 4,930,646. 3. Thermoplastic gaskets - Use thermoplastic hot 
melts as the sole gasketing compound generally applied as an  
 
annular ring. For example a fully cured thermoplastic urethane 
elastomer is applied in a crown closure as a completely reacted 
polymer. Patents in this category are 4,032,492, 4,085,186, 
4,336,011, 4,852,754, 4,988,467 and 4,968,514. 4. Adhesives - generally are directed towards some 
other area such as closure construction. Patents that mention 
the use of adhesives but do not define the chemical makeup of 
the adhesive such as 3,976,217 and 4,576,297. 5. Liner to shell Adhesives - Patents which describe 
a composition of the adhesives for bonding a liner to a closure 
shell, such as lacquer or sizings applied from solution to a 
metal shell or include a curing step to bond the liners by heat 
or pressure to the shell. See for example patents 2,976,200, 
3,496,060, 4,151,924 and 4,280,864. Closures with mechanically locked liners for hot fill 
and retort applications consist of a plastisol is mechanically 
held in a specially designed closure. The plastisol is applied 
and heat cured. Such a closure requires extensive capital 
equipment, plant floor space and labor to produce. Among the objectives of the present invention are to 
provide a closure which effectively can be used for hot fill 
and retortable applications such as food products, wherein there 
is a minimal modification required in making the closure with 
a liner; wherein there is no need for post-curing equipment;  
 
and wherein there is no additional space or labor above that 
needed for conventional lining operations. In accordance with the invention, a plastic closure 
is provided for sealing

<CLAIMS>
A plastic closure for sealing containers which have 
been filled with contents that are hot or which are to be 

autoclaved comprising 
   said plastic closure having a base wall and a 

peripheral skirt, 
   said skirt having means thereon for engaging means on 

a container, 
   said base wall of said closure having an inner surface, 

   a liner on said inner surface, 
   a reactive hot melt adhesive bonding said liner to 

said inner surface, 
   said reactive hot melt adhesive comprising a reactive 

hot melt adhesive which has become cross-linked after the liner 
is applied and cured to bond the liner to the inner surface of 

the base wall of the closure such that the liner will withstand 
and resist deformation under vacuum caused by cooling of the 

hot contents in a container or caused by retorting the contents 
of a container and subsequent cooling. 
The closure set forth in claim 1 wherein said hot 
melt adhesive comprises a cross-linkable adhesive selected from 

the group consisting of polyurethane and silicone. 
The closure set forth in any one of claims 1 and 2 
wherein the closure is made of polypropylene. 
The closure set forth in any one of claims 1 and 2 
wherein the closure is made of phenolic. 
The closure set forth in any one of claims 1-4 wherein 
the liner comprises a liner selected from the group consisting 

of an ethylene, propylede, α-olefin copolymers and SBR rubber. 
The method of making a plastic closure for sealing 
containers which have been filled with contents that are hot 

or which are to be autoclaved comprising 
   forming a plastic closure having a base wall and a 

peripheral skirt for engaging a container, 
   providing a liner on the inner surface of the base 

wall of the closure, 
   providing a reactive hot melt adhesive between the 

liner and the inner surface, said reactive hot melt adhesive 
comprising a reactive hot melt adhesive which can be crosslinked 

after the liner is applied and cured, 
   curing the liner to bond the liner to the inner surface 

of the base wall of the closure such that the liner will withstand 
and resist deformation under vacuum caused by cooling of the 

hot contents in a container or caused by retorting the contents 
of a container and subsequent cooling. 
The method set forth in claim 6 wherein said hot melt 
adhesive comprises a cross-linkable adhesive selected from the 

group consisting of polyurethane and silicone. 
The method set forth in any one of claims 6 and 7 
wherein the closure is made of polypropylene.
