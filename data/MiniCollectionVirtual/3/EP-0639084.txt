<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to compositions of ethylene oxide and heptafluoropropane and a method of sterilization using same. These environmentally acceptable compositions are chemically stable, minimally segregating, compatible with the objects being sterilized; provide sufficient vapor pressure to deliver the blend to the sterilization chamber, and possess improved flammability suppressant characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
Sterilization with a germicidal agent, such as ethylene oxide gas or ethylene oxide containing gas mixtures, has played an increasingly important role in sterilizing heat or moisture sensitive materials. Rapid growth in the use of sterile, disposable medical devices is just one consequence of gaseous sterilization with agents such as ethylene oxide. Gaseous sterilization of re-usable medical and surgical equipment using a non-flammable mixture of ethylene oxide and a carrier gas has also proven to be reliable, cost effective technology for many hospitals.The basic gaseous sterilization process consists of evacuating the sterilization chamber containing articles to be sterilized, preconditioning the articles at an optimal relative humidity, generally between 20-70%, admitting the sterilizing gas at an appropriate pressure and temperature, maintaining contact between the sterilizing atmosphere and the articles to be sterilized for an appropriate time, and finally discharging and evacuating the chamber to remove the sterilant gas.Although there are many variations on the basic process, the major factors which have to be controlled in order to effect the sterilization are exposure time, temperature, ethylene oxide pressure or partial pressure, and relative humidity.By itself, ethylene oxide is an extremely flammable gas, its flammability range extends from about 3.0% by volume to 100% by volume in air. Thus, when ethylene oxide is used alone as a sterilizing gas, precautions such as explosion proof equipment are mandatory.A preferable practice is to blend the ethylene oxide with another fluid which serves to dilute the ethylene oxide and render the mixture as a whole, non-flammable. Two such blends which have been used as sterilizing gases are dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12)/ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide/ethylene oxide. Inert carrier gases like CFG-12 and carbon dioxide inhibit the flammability of ethylene oxide and provide sufficient autogenous vapor pressure to deliver the liquid mixture from the source cylinder to the heat exchanger of the sterilizer vessel where the liquid mixture is vaporized.A disadvantage of using CFC-12 is sterilant gas mixtures is that fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons such as CFC-12 have substantial potential for stratospheric ozone depletion and global warming.Although the major purpose of the inert carrier gas component in these sterilizing gas mixtures is to mask the flammability characteristics of ethylene oxide, simple substitution of an arbitrary nonflammable gas
