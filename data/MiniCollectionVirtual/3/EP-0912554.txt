<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds having pharmacological activity,
processes for their preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use in the
treatment of CNS disorders.PCT/EP96/00368 (WO-A-96/23783, 08.08.96) (SmithKline Beecham plc)
describes indole and indoline derivatives which are described as possessing
5HT2C/2B receptor antagonist activity. A novel class of compounds has now been
discovered which fall within the generic scope of PCT/EP96/00368, but are not
specifically disclosed therein, and have been found to exhibit a surprisingly enhanced
5HT2C receptor antagonist activity profile (enhanced activity and duration of action
after oral dosing). 5HT2C receptor antagonists are believed to be of potential use in
the treatment of CNS disorders such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, obsessive
compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimers disease, sleep disorders, feeding
disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, withdrawal from drug abuse
such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also
disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus.
Compounds of the invention are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain
GI (gastrointestinal) disorders such as IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) as well as
microvascular diseases such as macular oedema and retinopathy.The present invention therefore provides, in a first aspect, a compound of
formula (I) or a salt thereof:

wherein:
X is CH or N;R1 is hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl;R2 and R3 groups are independently C1-6 alkyl or trifluoromethyl.C1-6 Alkyl groups, whether alone or as part of another group, may be straight
chain or branched.Preferably X is CH.Preferably R1 is methyl.Preferably R2 is CF3 (trifluoromethyl). Preferably R3 is C 1-6 alkyl, particularly methyl.Particular compounds of the invention include:
5 -Methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-1-[6-(2-methylpyridin-3-yloxy)-pyridin-3-ylcarbamoyl]indoline.
This compound can also be named as 5-Methyl-1-[2-(2-methylpyridin-3-yloxy)-5-pyridylcarbamoyl]-6-trifluoromethylindoline
or 2,3-Dihydro-5-methyl-N-[2-(2-methyl-3-pyridinyl)oxy]-5-pyridinyl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-indole-1-carboxamide,
5-Methyl-1-[6-(2-methylpyridin-3-yloxy)-pyridazin-3-ylcarbamoyl]-6-trifluoromethylindoline,
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.The compounds of the formula (I) can form acid addition salts with acids, such
as conventional pharmaceutically acceptable acids, for example maleic, hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, phosphoric, acetic, fumaric,
