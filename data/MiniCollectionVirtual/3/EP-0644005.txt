<ABSTRACT>
A punching die includes a punch body, a punch driver 
secured to the punch body, and a punch head provided for an 

upper portion of the punch driver. The punch head is struck 
by a striker. The punch die further includes a punch guide 

fitted to the punch body, a stripper plate disposed at a lower 
portion of the punch guide, a stripping spring interposed 

between the punch guide and a flange portion of the punch 
driver, and a elastically deformable damping member interposed 

between an upper surface of the punch driver and a lower 
surface of the punch head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a punching die, and more
specifically to a punching die which can prevent punching
noise generated during punching processing of work.Generally, the punching processing is effected by moving
up and down an upper die against work placed on a lower die.
Therefore, whenever the work is punched out, punching noise is
inevitably generated. In order to prevent the generation of
the punching noise, generally a damping material such as
urethane has been provided on a stripper plate disposed at the
lower portion of a punch guide for constituting a part of the
upper die.In the general way of providing a damping material such
as urethane on the stripper plate disposed at the lower
portion of the punch guide, however, there exists a problem in
that needle-shaped dust or refuse is inevitably produced
during punching processing and further adheres onto the
damping material or scratches the surface of the work to be
punched out. In addition, there exist other problems in that
the damping material is short in life time and difficult to be
mounted at the bottom of the punching die.With these problems in mind, therefore, it is the primary
object of the present invention to provide a punching die 
provided with a damping member excellent in punching noise
prevention performance, long in life time, and easy to be
mounted on the punching die.To achieve the above-mentioned object, the present
invention provides a punching die which includes a punch body, a
punch driver secured to the punch body, and a punch head
provided on an upper portion of the punch driver. The punch
head is adapted to be struck by a striker. The punch die further includes a
punch guide fitted to the punch body, a stripper plate
disposed at a lower portion of the punch guide, a stripping
spring interposed between the punch guide and a flange portion
of the punch driver, and a elastically deformable damping
member interposed between an upper surface of the punch driver
and a lower surface of the punch head.Further, it is preferable that the damping member is
interposed in a first part of a space between the upper
surface of the punch driver and the lower surface of the punch
head, and is not interposed in the remaining, second part of the space.
Moreover it is preferable that the distance between the upper
surface and the lower surface in the first part exceeds the
distance between the upper surface and the lower surface in
the second part, in the second part the upper surface being spaced
from the lower surface when the

<CLAIMS>
A punching die comprising:

a punch body (21);
a punch driver (31) secured to said punch body (21);
a punch head (37) provided on an upper portion of said punch
driver (31), said punch head (37) adapted to be struck by a striker;
a punch guide (15) fitted to said punch body (21);
a stripper plate (17) disposed at a lower portion of said punch
guide (15); and
a stripping spring (43) interposed between said punch guide (15) and
a flange portion (31F) of said punch driver (31);

characterised by
an elastically deformable damping member (39) being interposed between

an upper surface (61) of said punch driver (31) and a lower surface (62) of
said punch head (37).
The punching die of claim 1, wherein:

said damping member (39) is interposed in a first part of a
space between said upper surface (61) of said punch driver (31) and said

lower surface (62) of said punch head (37), and is not interposed in
the remaining, second part of said space.
The punching die of claim 2, wherein:

the distance between said upper surface (61) and said lower
surface (62) in said first part exceeds the distance between

said upper surface (61) and said lower surface (62) in said second part,
in said second part said upper surface (61) being spaced from said

lower surface (62) when said punch head (37) is not struck by said
striker.
