<ABSTRACT>
A direct chip attach module (DCAM) 10 comprises one or more 
electronic components 30 bonded to a printed circuit on a substrate. The 

DCAM is bonded to an electronic circuit assembly by means of connection 
pads 50 formed on the edge of the DCAM substrate. This enables easy 

visual inspection of solder joints between the DCAM and the assembly. 
DCAM substrates 70 are provided in panel form and vias 50 are 
drilled and plated at predetermined connection points. The DCAM is then 

excised from the panel and the cut vias provide connection pads 50 on the 
edge of the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the assembly of electronic 
circuits. More specifically the present invention relates to the 
attachment of circuit components onto planar circuit boards. A problem in the manufacture of integrated circuits and planar 
circuit boards is the attachment of chips and other circuit components to 
the substrate (or board) and the making of interconnections between 
components attached to a common substrate. A known method for attaching 
components is to solder the component pins into holes drilled at regular 
intervals through the substrate (or card). This is commonly known as pin 
in hole technology (PIH). An example of PIH technology is shown in 
Figure la. Problems with this technology are that it is not practical to 
attach components to both sides of the card and the components with 
associated pins take up a lot of space on the card. An alternative method of attaching components and chips is by 
utilising surface mount technology (SMT) in which components are attached 
to the surface of a printed circuit card. Holes are only drilled where 
necessary in order to make interconnections between wiring layers of the 
cards. An example of a component attached by SMT is shown in figure 1b. 
Advantages of this system are reduced drilling costs and more card space 
for wiring. Components can be easily attached to both sides of the card 
and can be mounted closer together. As the component lead-to-lead pitch 
is narrower in SMT than the pin-to-pin pitch in PIH, components can have 
more leads and therefore more functions. Furthermore many holes close 
together have a weakening effect on the mechanical strength of the 
substrate. Modern needs demand more dense circuit packages and with this 
comes more complex assembly processes. Accordingly, another method developed for attaching chips to a 
substrate is direct chip attach (DCA). As with SMT holes are only 
drilled where necessary to make interconnections between wiring layers in 
the card. However, the chips have electrically conductive pads on their 
underside, rather than legs or pins, for connection. An example of a DCA 
chip is shown in Figure 1c. The connections between the chip and the 
substrate cannot actually be seen as they are underneath the chip. These 
chips are attached to a circuit board by C-4 soldering (controlled 
collapse chip connection) in which solder balls are formed or placed on  
 
the circuit connection pads. The leadless chip is then placed on top and 
the solder reflowed by known methods which include
