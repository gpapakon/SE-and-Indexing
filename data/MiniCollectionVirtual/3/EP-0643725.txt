<DESCRIPTION>
 SINGLE CHAIN PEPTIDE COMPOUNDS HAVING HEMOREGULATORY ACTIVITYThe present invention relates to the use of peptides having an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, and to novel peptides having specific and/or general cell inhibitory effects.The mammalian body contains cells having enormously diverse structures and functions, and the mechanisms of differentiation and development have been the focus of much study. It is known that for systems of cells having a continuous turnover the mechanism commonly involves a reservoir of pluripotent stem cells which divide and constantly supply new cells to the system. While initially homogeneous the stem cells supplied from the "reservoir" soon become committed to one or other morphology and subsequently develop into the required functional cells.Examples of such stem cell systems are the haemopoietic system in bone marrow and the epithelial and epidermal systems.The manipulation or control of stem cell division is of great potential therapeutically and much research continues to be devoted to elucidating the mechanisms involved and the chemical messengers responsible. To date several biomolecules have been identified as possessing a role in cell production and differentiation either by the stimulation or inhibition of a step within the process. Myelopoiesis has been particularly well studied in this regard and molecules involved in its control include: colony-stimulating factors (CSF) such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) , macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF) , multi-lineage colony-stimulating factor ( ulti- CSF; IL-3) [see Metcalf, Science .221: 16 (1985)], interleukin 11 (IL-11) [see Paul et al Proc Natl Acad 

Sci USA 8_7: 7521 (1990)], Lactoferrin [see Broxmeyer et al Blood Cells 13.: 429 (1986)], prostoglandins [see Pelus et al J. Immunol 140: 479 (1988)], acidic (H- subunit) ferritin [see Broxmeyer et al Blood 6_8: 1257 (1986)], interferons (a , β and 7) [see Pelus et al supra, and Broxmeyer et al J. Immunol 131: 1300 (1983)], tumour necosis factors (α and β ) [see Broxmeyer et al J Immunol 136: 4487 (1986)], transforming growth factor-0 [see Ott an et al J Immunol 140: 2661 (1988)], and activin and inhibin [see Broxmeyer et al Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86= 779 (1989)].It has also been found that the haemoregulatory pentapeptide (pEEDCK) inhibits the proliferation of yelopoietic cells selectively [see Paukovits et al Z. Naturforsch .37.: 1297 (1982) ] and other peptides
