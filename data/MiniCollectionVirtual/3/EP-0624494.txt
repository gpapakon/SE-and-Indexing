<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a junction box which can 
easily bridge and separate terminal portions of conductive 

plates provided in the box. Bus bars 2 are arranged 
vertically and in parallel in the box. A cover 1 of the 

box is provided with an opening 3 which is closed and opened 
with a lid 5. A shorting terminal 9 is mounted by guides 

18 on a rear side of the lid 5 slidably in a direction of 
bridging the bus bars 2. The shorting terminal 9 has 

contact portions 11 which are spaced from each other by the 
same distance as that existing between the bus bars 2 and 

adapted to elastically clamp the bus bars 2. The shorting 
terminal is accommodated in a casing 13. When the lid 5 is 

closed, each bus bar 2 enters into the corresponding contact 
portion 11 of the shorting terminal 9 to close the shorting 

circuit. When the lid 5 is opened, the bus bar 2 leaves 
from the contact portion 11 to open the shorting circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a junction box to be used for internal 
wiring in a motive vehicle and the like and more particularly to an 
improvement of a shorting construction of conductive plates in the box. It is often necessary in such a junction box to draw and insert a 
shorting terminal from and into terminal portions of conductive plates 
which constitute a shorting circuit upon, for example, inspecting it. 
Heretofore, at such a time, the shorting terminal is drawn out from the 
terminal portions after a lid mounted on a top wall of a box body is 
opened and the shorting terminal is inserted into the portions again after 
inspection. Then, the lid is closed. This prior arrangement for a junction 
box is known from US Patent No. 3 917 371. That is, heretofore, the inspecting process of the shorting circuit 
was troublesome because the shorting terminal had to be drawn and 
inserted manually in addition to opening and closing the lid. As a result 
it may be dropped by accident into a confined space due to its small size. We are also aware of European Patent Application 
No. EP-A-0 476 654 which discloses a wiring structure according to the preamble of 
claim 1 in which a shorting terminal is provided fixedly on the lid portion. An object of the present invention is to provide a junction box 
which can easily bridge and separate terminal portions of conductive 
plates provided in a box body. In order to achieve the above object, we provide a junction box 
which comprises: a box body having an opening; a lid pivotably mounted  
 
on said box body to close and open said opening; metal conductive plates 
provided in said box body for constituting an electrical circuit, each plate 
being provided with a terminal portion; and a shorting terminal for 
bridging said terminal portions when said lid closes said opening, 
characterised in that said terminal portions of said conductive plates are 
arranged along said opening, and said lid is provided with springs which 
push said shorting terminal to said conductive plates. In the junction box of the present invention, when the lid is 
opened, the shorting terminal mounted on the rear side of the lid exits 
from the terminal portions of the conductive plates to separate the contact 
portions. When the lid is closed, the shorting terminal contacts with the 
terminal portions of the conductive plates to bridge the terminal portions. When the lid is closed, the shorting terminal is pushed onto the 
terminal portions of the conductive plates by an elastic force of
