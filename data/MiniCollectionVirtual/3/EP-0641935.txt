<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulically actuated diaphragm pump has a diaphragm (1) which consists of at least two individual layers (1a, 1b). Said individual layers are clamped, at least in their central zone, between a discharge chamber-side and a hydraulics chamber-side linkage member (25, 26) and are thereby mechanically linked to one another. The linkage members (25, 26) are further linked to a spool valve (pilot valve, control valve) (19) of a leakage replenishment device which is controlled by the position of the diaphragm, the spool valve being guided so as to be displaceable in the pump body (2).

Hydraulically driven diaphragm pump with a diaphragm 
which is clamped circumferentially between a pump element 

and a pump lid and comprises at least two individual 
layers, separates a conveying chamber comprising separate 

inlet and outlet ducts for a medium to be conveyed from a 
hydraulic chamber and can be reciprocated between a suction 

stroke end position and a pressure stroke end position by a 
hydraulic diaphragm drive in the form of an oscillating 

displacement piston, the individual layers (1a, 1b) of the 
diaphragm (1) being clamped at least in their central 

region between a coupling member (25) on the side facing 
the conveying chamber and a coupling member (26) on the 

side facing the hydraulic chamber and being thereby 
mechanically coupled with one another, characterised in 

that the coupling members (25, 26) are connected to a 
control pushrod (19) of a leakage compensating device which 

is controlled as a function of the diaphragm position, the 
control pushrod (19) being displaceably guided in the pump 

element (2), the coupling member (25) on the side facing 
the conveying chamber comprising a rod-like securing 

element (32), which passes through central through 
apertures in the diaphragm (1) and in the coupling member 

(26) on the side facing the hydraulic chamber and is 

secured to the control pushrod (19) in that it passes 
through a continuous longitudinal bore inside the control 

pushrod (19) and is secured to the end of the control 
pushrod facing the displacement piston (6). 
A diaphragm pump according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the coupling members (25, 26) are constructed as 

abutment elements comprising abutment surfaces which 
cooperate with both the conveying chamber limiting wall of 

the pump lid (3) and the pump element (2) in order to 
mechanically limit the pressure stroke and suction stroke 

of the diaphragm (1).  
 
A diaphragm pump according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the coupling members (25, 26) are 

constructed in such a manner that, together with associated 
pump element or pump lid surfaces, they each form a support 

surface for the diaphragm (1) in the pressure stroke or 
suction stroke limiting position of the diaphragm (1), 

which support surface matches the natural diaphragm 
geometry and is at least substantially continuous. 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the coupling members (25, 26) 

are constructed as rotationally symmetrical support disks, 
more particularly with flat end faces. 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the coupling member (25) on 

the side facing the conveying chamber is enclosed by a 
plastics material layer (40). 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the coupling member (26) on 

the side facing the hydraulic chamber is integrally formed 
with the control pushrod (19). 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the radius at least of the 

coupling member (25) on the side facing the conveying 
chamber is equal to or greater than half the radius of the 

diaphragm section lying in the conveying chamber (4). 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the coupling member (25) on 

the side facing the conveying chamber is dimensioned and 
arranged in such a manner that it at least for the most 

part covers the openings of the inlet and outlet ducts (14, 
15).  

 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the inlet and outlet ducts 

(14, 15) open into the conveying chamber (4) in a region 
near the centre, the distance between the centre point of 

the inlet and outlet ducts (14, 15) and the central axis 
(27) of the conveying chamber (4) measuring at the most 50% 

of the maximum conveying chamber radius. 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that, in the region of their 

openings on the side facing the conveying chamber, the 
inlet and outlet ducts (14, 15) are aligned parallel to the 

direction of movement of the diaphragm (1). 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the area of the conveying 

chamber limiting wall lying between the inlet and outlet 
ducts (14, 15) is constructed in particular as a flat 

abutment surface for the coupling member (25) on the side 
facing the conveying chamber. 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the individual diaphragm 

layers (1a, 1b) comprise a corrugation (21) in the region 
between the coupling members (25, 26) and the 

circumferential clamping site.

claims, characterised in that a ventilation bore (35) is

A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a solid particle discharge
