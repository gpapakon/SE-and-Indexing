<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to paging transmission
systems and, more particularly, but not by way of
limitation, it relates to an improved method of paging
transmission which conveys text, coded matter and/or
pictorial data with maximum message content for reception
and reproduction by means of a paging-type receiver or
equivalent functioning in combination with a personal
computer. In essence, the method entails the initial
development of the data as binary signal data with
subsequent encoding as, for example, ASCII data which is
then transmitted via a paging system and received for
subsequent decoding and data output indication.There have been many prior attempts at collection
and compression of data for subsequent transmission to
transmit maximum amounts of data in compressed or
bandwidth reduced form, with subsequent reception at
remote locations using receivers of limited size and data
reproduction capabilities. This has been particularly
evident from the various attempts at transmitting
electrocardiogram (ECG) information for subsequent data 
analysis and diagnosis. One such approach to the storage
and transmission of ECG data is disclosed in a paper
entitled A New Data Compression Algorithm for
Computerized ECG Signal by Walter H. Chang and C.D. Kao
which appeared in IEEE/8th Annual Conference of the
Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, pages 311-314,
under copyright in 1986. This paper is specifically
related to transmission of ECG data and the method of
doing so utilizing signal compression using the Huffman
Minimum Entropy Coding Method to attain increased data
reduction ratio. This method succeeded in transmitting
and retrieving ECG data of twelve leads per patient along
with a 30 second rhythm strip record and other pertinent
data; however, the system required a mass of storage
medium and an inordinate amount of time to deal with such
a large amount of data, even when reduced by data compression.Current paging systems carry minimal information for
reception and indication at remote positions; however,
this information carrying capacity is extremely limited.
Any attempt to transmit extensive data or text messages
by the present day national paging system hook-ups, i.e.,
EMBARK (Motorola) or SKYTEL (MTEL), would be cost prohibitive
without extensive alterations to the transmit/receive
systems. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention
to provide a paging transmission system that is capable
of transmitting complex data to a remote position for
reception by a paging
