<DESCRIPTION>
trans-2-Methoxycyclohexanol is a useful synthon; for 
instance, it can be converted to 2-methoxycyclohexanone 
which is an intermediate for antibiotic compounds, and 
potentially as an auxiliary for control of chirality in 
asymmetric synthesis. For such purposes, it is essential 
that the trans-2-methoxycyclo-hexanol is used in single-enantiomer 
form. trans-2-Methoxycyclohexanol can be resolved by 
biocatalysis but in the case of a requirement for the 
[1(S),2(S)]-enantiomer, our experience is that biocatalysis 
using a commercially-available enzyme such as Amano PS 
lipase (from Pseudomonasfluorescens) is a lengthy 
procedure requiring considerable amounts of enzyme. According to the present invention, an effective 
procedure has been discovered for the production of 
enantiomers of 2-methoxycyclohexanol, by resolution of the 
hemiphthalate ester with a chiral amine. Examples of the 
chiral amine are the (S) and (R) enantiomers of α-methylbenzylamine 
(1-phenylethylamine). A schematic 
representation of the procedure is then as outlined in 
Scheme 1. According to the Scheme, racemic trans-methoxycyclohexanol, 
produced from acid-mediated addition of methanol 
with cyclohexene oxide, is converted to the hemiphthalate 
with phthalic anhydride. The (S)-enantiomer of α-methylbenzyl-amine 
gives crystals that yield the [(S),(S)] 
enantiomer of 2-methoxycyclohexanol. Typically, the 
initial crystallisation gives 30% yield of salt, in a 
diastereo-isomeric excess of 70%. Recrystallisation of the 
salt elevates the enantiomeric excess. An appropriate 
solvent is used for the procedure, such as a mixture of 
ethyl acetate or methyl t-butyl ether with ethanol or 2-propanol. As an alternative way of operating the process, the 
enantiomer of the chiral amine can be used that provides 
the desired enantiomer of the methoxycyclohexanol initially  
 
in the liquors. Thus, use of (R)-α-methylbenzylamine may 
give liquors containing the methoxycyclohexanol component 
in 70% yield and 30% ee for [(S), (S)] isomer. This 
enriched material can be broken down to the free 
hemiphthalate, and then another chiral amine (e.g. (S)-α-methylbenzylamine) 
used to elevate ee with the benefit of 
the initial enrichment. A further feature of the invention is the use of more 
than one amine (as indicated above), the first to give a 
partial resolution, and the second to elevate enantiomeric 
excess. The second amine need not necessarily be chiral, 
provided that the salt increases in ee on 
recrystallisation. A corollary of this is
