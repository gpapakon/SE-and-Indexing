<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce a trench (6) in a substrate, which trench comprises at least a first silicon layer (3), an insulating layer (2) and a second silicon layer (1), a first trench-etching process is carried out through the first silicon layer (3) as far as the insulating layer (2) with the use of a trench mask (4). After reinforcing the trench mask (4) by means of a non-conformally deposited protective layer (7), the insulating layer (2) is etched through as far as the second silicon layer (1) in a second trench-etching process. The method is particularly suitable for the production of isolation trenches having integrated substrate-contact formation for smart-power technology on an SOI substrate.
