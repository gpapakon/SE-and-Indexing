<ABSTRACT>
A micro-structured optical fibre having a cladding comprising a number of elements having a non-circular cross-section. Each element has at least one part extending outside a circle having the same cross-sectional area as the element. These extending parts are directed in the same direction. This cladding structure provides polarisation preserving properties to the optical fibre. Optical fibres using this technology may have claddings with elements placed non-periodically as well as in a two-dimensional periodic lattice - such as cladding providing Photonic Band Gap (PBG) effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
POLARISATION PRESERVING OPTICAL FIBREThe present invention relates to optical fibres and especially to optical fibres having claddings having isolated refractive index elements taking part in defining an overall cladding refractive index.Optical fibres of this type (which may generally be referred to as micro-structured fibres) have been described in a number of references, such as WO 99/64903 and WO 99/64904 describing such fibres having claddings defining Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structures, and US patent no. 5,802,236, and Monro et al. (see Optics Letters, Vol.25 (4), p.206, February 2000) defining fibres where the light is transmitted using modified Total Internal Reflection (TIR).Optical fibres and integrated optical wave guides are today applied in a wide range of applications within the areas such as optical communications, sensor technology, spectroscopy, and medicine. The performance of most such applications is affected by or dependent upon the polarization of the light travelling through the fibre. Many systems also suffer from polarization-dependent losses or polarization-dependent propagation properties that can affect system performance. Design of polarization controlling devices in fibre optical systems is therefore vital. The present invention includes design of novel types of polarization controlling optical fibres, for which the polarization of light coupled to one end of fibre can be preserved at the output end - so-called polarization maintaining fibres.Light propagating through an optical fibre can be classified as linearly polarised, ellipticaliy polarised and circularly polarised. If the optical fibre has a deviation away from a perfect circular symmetric design (as is the case for optical fibres in practice), this polarization will generally cause the light to split into separate polarization states (two states for the fundamental mode of optical fibres), which will travel at different speeds along the fibre.For certain applications it is desirable to enhanced such deviations - and create high- birefringent fibres - as it is e.g., the case for polarization-maintaining fibres (see Agrawal, "Non-linear fiber optics", Academic Press, Second ed., 1995). For other applications, however, even small deviations may be strongly degrading to the system performance. In particular, for high-speed, long-distance optical communication systems (operating at bit- 

rates of 10 GHz and beyond), an increased attention is now being paid to polarization effects. For such fast systems even very low
