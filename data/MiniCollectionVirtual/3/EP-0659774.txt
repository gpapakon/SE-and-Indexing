<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for producing a 
syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) which comprises polymerizing a 

styrenic monomer having a content of indene-based compounds 
of at most 50 ppm by bringing a polymerization catalyst into 

contact with the above styrenic monomer, which catalyst 
preferably comprises an (A) transition metal compound (e.g. 

Ti compound) and (B) an (a) compound capable of reacting with 
the above transition metal compound (component (A)) to form 

an ionic complex (e.g. DMAB) or a (b) oxygen atom-containing 
compound (e.g. MAO), and optinally a (C) alkyl group-containing 

metallic compound (e.g. TIBA). By virtue of using 
the above styrenic monomer, the process enables to minimize 

the amount of the residual metals in the resultant styrenic 
polymer without deterioration of the catalytic activity, 

simplify the process and thereby curtail the production cost 
of SPS.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing
a styrenic polymer. More particularly, it pertains to a
process for producing a styrenic polymer having a high degree
of syndiotactic configuration efficiently and inexpensively.In recent years, there has been proposed a process for
producing a styrenic polymer having a syndiotactic
configuration (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "SPS") by
polymerizing a styrenic monomer by means of a catalyst
comprising a transition metal compound as a primary
ingredient, especially a titanium compound and an
alkylaluminoxane (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No. 187708/1987).There has also been proposed a process for efficiently
producing such a styrenic polymer (SPS) by the use of a
catalyst comprising a coordination complex compound composed
of an anion in which a plurality of radicals are bonded to a
metal and a cation, while dispensing with an aluminoxane
which is expensive and is to be used in a large amount (refer
to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 249503/1992,
249504/1994, etc.)However, the use of the above-mentioned catalyst for the
purpose of polymerizing a styrenic monomer involves the
problems that the catalytic activity deteriorates resulting 
in an increase in the amounts of residual metals contained in
the styrenic polymer thus produced and causing a decrease in
the molecular weight of the resultant styrenic polymer or a
deterioration of the hue of the same and that the amounts of
the residual metals need to be reduced, thus complicating the
production process of the polymer, for example, an increase
in the number of steps, whereby the production cost of the
polymer is unreasonably increased.As a result of intensive research and investigation made
by the present inventors under such circumstances, it has
been found that in the case of polymerizing a styrenic
monomer by bringing a catalyst for producing SPS into contact
therewith, an indene-based compound which is contained in the
styrenic monomer exerts significant effect on the catalytic
activity of the catalyst. The present invention has been
accomplished on the basis of the above-mentioned finding and
information.Specifically the present invention provides a process
for producing a styrenic polymer having a syndiotactic
configuration which comprises polymerizing a styrenic monomer
having a content of indene-based compounds of at most 50 ppm
by bringing a polymerization catalyst for producing the
styrenic polymer having a sydiotactic configuration into
contact with
