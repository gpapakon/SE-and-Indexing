<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated mask and goggle 
structure such as may be used for welders for protecting the face, 
respiratory organs system, or portions from industrial hazards, such 
as sparks, poisonous gases and dusts, and used for a surgeon for 
protecting the face during a surgical operation. There have been commonly used devices to protect the face, 
respiratory organs of a wearer from industrial hazards in the forms 
of a mask and a goggle without a means for joining to each other, 
which requires individually wearing thereof. Accordingly, it was 
time consuming and cumbersome to wear and remove such devices. In addition, another disadvantage resides in the fact that 
a clearance between the mask and the goggle may allow the industrial 
hazards to enter the face therethrough. Consequently, the devices 
of these types may not fully protect the face of the wearer.  It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a new and improved integrated mask and goggle structure 
which can be readily and instantly mounted to protect the face of a 
wearer, while securely preventing industrial hazards from entering 
the face of the wearer therethrough. Accordingly there is provided an integrated mask and goggle 
structure of the present invention which comprises a mask adapted 
to surround the mouth and the nose of a wearer, and a goggle 
adapted to surround the eyes and detachably mounted to the mask. The integrated mask and goggle structure of the present 
invention further comprises a mounting member adapted to be fitted 
to a lower portion of the goggle, and a mounting means provided on 
the mounting member so as to detachably mount the mask thereto. An integrated mask and goggle structure of the present 
invention further comprises a mask adapted to surround the mouth and 
the nose of a wearer, a goggle adapted to surround the eyes, and a 
mounting means disposed between the mask and the goggle such that 
the goggle is detachably mounted to the mask. In another aspect, the present invention features an  
 
integrated mask and goggle structure which enables the goggle to 
move between its operative position and its withdrawn position on 
the mask. Accordingly to this aspect of the present invention, 
between the mask and the goggle is provided a means for slidably 
mounting the goggle on the mask. This arrangement also prevents the 
industrial hazards from entering the face of the wearer. The above, and other objects, features and advantages of 
the present invention will become
