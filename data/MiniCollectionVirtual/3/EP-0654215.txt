<ABSTRACT>
Biodegradable litter for animals. This litter consists of flax or hemp or mixtures thereof impregnated with 2 to 6 % by weight of a hygiene and binding oily composition, the said oily composition containing rapeseed or sunflower oil or mixtures thereof and at least one antiseptic agent. This litter has an excellent absorbing power, does not release dust and has a beneficial effect on the animal's respiratory system.

<CLAIMS>
Biodegradable animal litter, characterized in
that it consists of a bed of flax or hemp or mixtures

thereof impregnated with 2 to 6% by weight of an oily
fixing hygiene composition, the said oily composition

containing rapeseed oil or sunflower oil or mixtures
thereof and at least one antiseptic agent.
Litter according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said beds are beds of flax.
Litter according to either of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the said beds are approximately

between 2 and 30 mm in size.
Litter according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the said beds are impregnated

with an amount less than or equal to 4% by weight
of the said oily composition.
Litter according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the oily composition

contains from 80 to 99.9% by weight of oil as defined in
Claim 1.
Litter according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the said antiseptic agent

is chosen from alkylphenol derivatives and monooxygenated
cyclic terpene derivatives, and mixtures thereof.
Litter according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the alkylphenol derivative is thymol.
Litter according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the monooxygenated cyclic terpene derivative is

chosen from menthol and eucalyptol.
Litter according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said oily composition

also contains at least one additive chosen from camphor,
nutmeg oil and oak leaf oil.
Litter according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it also contains a mixture

of bacteria.
Process for preparing the biodegradable litter
according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that it comprises steps consisting in:

(i) introducing beds of flax or hemp or mixtures
thereof into a closed container,
(ii) suspending the beds in the atmosphere of
the said container, and
(iii) spraying the oily composition from the top
part of the said container in the direction of the said

beds and thus impregnating them and binding the dust to
them.
Preparation process according to Claim 11,
characterized in that it comprises, prior to step (i), a

cleaning step consisting in removing some of the dust
present on the beds.
Preparation process according to Claim 12,
characterized in that the said cleaning step is carried

out until a level of residual dust, measured according to
AFNOR standard NF V03904, of less than or equal to 5% by

weight relative to the weight of the said beds is
obtained.
Process according to Claim 13, characterized in
that the said level of residual dust is less than or

equal to 3% by weight relative to the weight of the said
beds.
Process according to any one of Claims 11 to 14,
characterized in that it comprises, prior to step (i), a

step consisting in calibrating the beds, in order to
obtain beds whose average length is approximately between

2 and 30 mm.
Preparation process according to either of
Claims 11 and 15, characterized in that it comprises,

after the spraying step (iii), inoculating the said 
litter with a mixture of bacteria in a proportion of

between 2‰ and 5‰ by weight of solids relative to the
total weight of the said litter.
