<ABSTRACT>
A block segmenting circuit (22) segments a digital video signal. 
A block encoding circuit (24) encodes the block segmented data. 

A head (H) 
records the encoded data on a tape. A block segmenting circuit (30) 

varies 
the start address of each block. An error between the 

original data and the decoded data at each start address is detected. 
A cumulating 

circuit (36) cumulates the errors for a predetermined time period. A 
detecting circuit (39) det
ects the minimum value of the cumulated 
values. Thus, a block start address with the lowest error is 

determined. With a block construction defined by the start address, the 
block segmenting circuit (22) performs block segmentation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to encoding methods and apparatuses for
digital video signals. More particularly, but not exclusively, the
invention relates to encoding methods and apparatuses suitable for a
digital video tape recorder (VTR).Digital VTRs that record digital video signals on magnetic tapes
with rotating heads are known. A digital VTR encodes an input video
signal so as to compress the data amount thereof. For example, a block
encoding technique where a video signal is formed of two-dimensional
blocks and encoded block by block is known. The present applicants
have proposed a so-called ADRC (Adaptive Dynamic Range Coding) system.
In the ADRC system, video data is converted into block-structured data.
Each pixel data of each block is quantized with a quantizing step width
corresponding to a dynamic range of the block. This system is
disclosed in United States Patent No. US-A-4 703 352.In analog VTRs, it is known that even if dubbing is repeated
(multiple debugging is performed), the quality of the dubbed image is
deteriorated. However, in digital VTRs, even if multiple dubbing is
repeated, the image quality is not deteriorated. To accomplish
multiple dubbing without deterioration of the image quality in digital
VTRs, when block codes are repeatedly encoded and 
decoded, the boundary of each block should not be moved.
However, as will be described, it was difficult to satisfy
such conditions.Fig. 5 is a block diagram schematically showing
an example of a dubbing system. In the drawing, reference
numerals 1A and 1B are digital VTRs. The digital VTR 1A
has an analog video input terminal 1Aa, a digital video
input terminal 1Da, an analog video output terminal OAa,
and a digital video output terminal ODa. Likewise, the
digital VTR 1B has input terminals 1Ab and 1Db and output
terminals OAb and ODb.An A/D converter 2 is disposed between the input
terminal 1Aa and a record processing circuit 3. The A/D
converter 2 converts an input analog video signal into a
digital video signal of for example 8 bits/sample. The
output signal of the A/D converter 2 is supplied to the
record processing circuit 3. The record processing
circuit 3 performs various predetermined processes such as
block segmenting process, block encoding process, error
correction code encoding process, frame segmenting
process, and channel modulating process. The record
processing circuit 3 outputs record data. The record data
is supplied to a head H. The head H records the record
data on a magnetic tape T. Normally, the head H is
constructed
