<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a method of identifying gases and/or determining gas concentrations in gas mixtures, in particular in exhaust gases from internal-combustion engines. The method calls for the rates of adsorption and/or desorption of the gas mixture, influenced by the gas concentration, to be monitored by a gas sensor. The effect on the gas concentration is due to a variable supply of oxygen to the gas sensor by an electrochemical oxygen pump cell. The behaviour with time of the response function under the influence of the gas concentration is analysed. By comparison with standardized behaviours with time for individual gases, the gases in the mixture are identified. The amplitude of the response function provides information on the gas concentration.

Method for the determination of gas components
and/or gas concentrations of gas mixtures, in

particular in exhaust gases of internal-combustion
engines, in which the adsorption and/or desorption

rates of the gas mixture, caused by a change in gas
concentration at a gas sensor, are evaluated,

characterized in that the change in gas concentration
is determined through a variable supply of oxygen to

the gas sensor, the oxygen being converted by means of
catalysis and transported to the gas sensor in ion

form, in that the time profile of the response function
to the change in gas concentration is recorded, and in

that the gas components are determined using a
comparison with standardized time profiles.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the oxygen is supplied to the gas sensor using an

electrochemical oxygen pump cell.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the gas concentration of the gas mixture

supplied to the gas sensor is varied discontinuously,
and in that the gas components are determined by the

transient behaviour of the response function of the
sensor signal of the gas sensor.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the discontinuous variation in the concentration

is produced by turning off the oxygen supply.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the amplitude of the response function of the 

sensor signal, set up after the transient behaviour, is
used as a measure of the pollutant concentration.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the sensor signal of the gas sensor is

modulated through a modulation of the oxygen supply,
and in that the gas components are determined using the

time profile of the response to the modulation
frequency of the oxygen supply.
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in
that, in order to modulate the sensor signal, use is

made of an electrochemical oxygen pump cell whose pump
current and/or pump voltage are modulated.
Method according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized
in that the amplitude of the modulation frequency is

used as a measure of the gas concentration.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that oxygen excess is set up

at the gas sensor during the setting of the sensor
signal to constant conductivity.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a semiconductor gas

sensor, preferably an SnO
2
 gas sensor, is used as the
gas sensor.
