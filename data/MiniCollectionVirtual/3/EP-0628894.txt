<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an image 
forming apparatus comprising image forming means 

for forming a toner image on a recording material 
at a recording position, convey means having a 

recording material bearing member (6) for bearing the 
recording material for conveying the recording 

material to the recording position, first cleaning 
means (13a) having a brush-shaped cleaning member (13a1) slidingly 

contacted with a surface of the recording material 
bearing member (6) for cleaning the surface of the 

recording material bearing member (6), and second 
cleaning means (13b) having an oil absorber member (13b1) abutted 

against the surface of the recording material bearing 
member (6) for cleaning the surface of the recording 

material bearing member (6). The oil absorber member (13b1) 
is abutted against the surface of the recording 

material bearing member (6) at a side opposite to a side 
where the toner is scattered due to the sliding 

contact between the brush-shaped cleaning member (13a1) 
and the surface of the recording material bearing 

member (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a laser
beam printer and the like, and more particularly, it
relates to an image forming apparatus having a
recording material bearing member for conveying a
recording material to a position where a toner image
is transferred onto the recording material.As image forming apparatuses in which a toner
image is formed on a recording material, an image
forming technique wherein a recording material is
born on a recording material bearing member and a
toner image is transferred onto the recording material while
the recording material bearing member is being moved
has been proposed. Particularly, this technique is
frequently applied to a color copying machine wherein
toner images having different colors are superimposed
on a recording material to obtain a full-color image.
An example of such a color copying machine is shown
in Fig. 6.In a color copying machine shown in Fig. 6,
an electrostatic latent image is formed on a
photosensitive drum 50 by illuminating light 
corresponding to image information onto the
photosensitive drum which has been charged positively
or negatively, by means of an exposure means 51. The
latent image is developed by a developing means 52 as
a toner image which is in turn transferred onto a
recording medium. In order to successively
transfer a plurality of toner images onto the
recording medium, the recording medium is wound
around a transfer drum (recording medium bearing
member) 54 and the plural toner images are
successively transferred onto the recording medium
while the transfer drum 54 is being rotated.In order to utilize the resources
effectively, in such a color copying machine, it is
desirable to form the toner images on both surfaces
of the recording medium. In this case, it is
considered that, after the toner is transferred to
the surface of the recording medium, the recording
medium is sent by a convey means (not shown) to a
fixing means where the toner image is fixed to the
recording medium, and then the recording medium is
wound around the transfer drum 54 again so that a new
toner image can be transferred onto the other surface
of the recording medium.On the other hand, in fixing devices for
fixing a toner image to a recording material such as
fixing devices which comprise a fixing roller and a 
pressure roller and in which a toner image is fixed
to a recording material by heat and pressure while
the recording material is being moved by these
rollers, oil is generally coated on the

An image forming apparatus comprising an image
bearing member (1) for carrying a toner image, a

recording material bearing member (6) having a surface
for supporting a recording material thereon, means at a

transfer position for transferring the toner image from
the image bearing member to a recording material

supported by the recording material bearing member, first
cleaning means (13a) at a cleaning position for removing

toner on the support surface of the recording material
bearing member and having a cleaning brush (13a1) for

contact with a support surface of the recording material

bearing member and for movement relative to the support
surface to clean the recording material bearing member,

and fixing means (15) for fixing the toner image to the
recording material, characterised in that


(a) means (17, 18, 19) is provided for receiving the
recording material from the recording material bearing

member (6) after transfer of a toner image to a first
surface of said recording material and for returning the

recording material to the recording material bearing
member (6) with its first surface in contact with the

recording material bearing member (6) and with its second
surface exposed for transfer of a toner image thereto;
(b) second cleaning means (13b;13c;13d) is provided for
cleaning from the support surface of the recording

material bearing member 6, oil from the fixing means 
(15), which oil becomes transported to the support

surface of the recording material bearing member (6) via
the first surface of the recording material, said second

cleaning means being between the cleaning position and
