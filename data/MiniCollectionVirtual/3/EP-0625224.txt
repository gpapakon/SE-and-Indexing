<ABSTRACT>
An image carrier and a method for forming a reprographic image thereon is disclosed, said image carrier comprising a support and an opaque hydrophilic colloid layer characterized in that said opaque hydrophilic colloid layer contains at least two kinds of opacifying agents, being (a) polymeric particles consisting of hollow spherical core/sheat beads, (b) titanium dioxide of the anatase crystal modification. The image carrier can further contain an amount of common rutile titanium dioxide. In the preferred embodiment the reprographic image is a multicolour colloid pattern serving as a pre-press proof. By appropriately choosing different ratios of the respective amounts of the different opacifying agents, a set of image carriers serving as receptor materials for transferred coloured layers can be provided giving rise to different dot gain percentages in the final proof but showing essentially the same background whiteness. The support of the image carrier can be a polyolefin covered paper base or an organic polymeric resin. This polyolefin layer or polymeric resin can be opacified themselves with titanium dioxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image carrier for a 
reprographic image, e.g. a black-and-white reprographic image or a 
multicolour image intended as pre-press colour proof, and to 
processes for forming said images. In the colour field of pre-press graphic arts there has been a 
long felt need for a simple and fast technique offering "colour 
proofs" of high quality and reproducibility. Photographically produced colour proofs are a simulation for 
multicolour halftone reproductions as will be produced by successive 
printing in register with the separate standard inks : magenta, 
yellow, cyan and black on a conventional printing press. Press proofing for the production of colour proofs by preparing 
a printing plate and running the plate on the press to produce only 
a few copies as proof of the quality of the halftone separation 
transparencies used in the plate production is a very cumbersome and 
expensive procedure and therefore photographic processes have been 
developed to obtain a similar result by means of which the 
appearance of a print starting from particular colour separation 
negatives or positives can be judged by the printer and client. According to a process known from US-A-3,642,474 the production 
of such a proof in the form of superposed coloured colloid patterns, 
proceeds with coloured hydrophilic colloid layers, which are 
insolubilized in the irradiated portions by means of an active 
species formed during or after the information-wise exposure to 
active electromagnetic radiation of a photosensitive substance, and 
comprises the following steps : 
(1) transferring a coloured hydrophilic colloid layer containing a 
said photosensitive substance and a hydrophilic colloid, which  
 
undergoes a reduction in solubility in water by said active species, 
from a temporary support, which is more hydrophobic than a permanent 
support to which said layer has to be transferred, to said permanent 
support by pressing the latter in the presence of an aqueous liquid 
against said colloid layer, and removing the temporary support, thus 
leaving said layer on the permanent support; (2) exposing the transferred colloid layer in substantially dry 
state to actinic electromagnetic radiation, which is modulated 
according to the information to be recorded, (3) developing the exposed layer by means of an aqueous liquid 
followed by a wash-off processing resulting in a coloured relief 
pattern, and repeating the steps (1), (2) and (3) with said 
hydrophilic colloid layers having a colour as

Process for the production of a line and/or halftone 
reprographic image comprising the steps of exposing information-wise 

a photosensitive composition and transferring it before or after 
said exposure step to an image carrier comprising a support and an 

opaque hydrophilic colloid layer, characterized in that said opaque 
hydrophilic colloid layer contains at least two kinds of opacifying 

agents, being 

(a) polymeric particles consisting of hollow spherical core/sheat 
beads, 
(b) titanium dioxide of the anatase crystal modification. 
Process according to claim 1 wherein said opaque hydrophilic 
colloid layer further contains titanium dioxide of the rutile 

crystal modification. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said line and/or 
halftone reprographic image is a multicolour colloid pattern formed 

in said photosensitive composition. 
Process according to claim 3 wherein said multicolour colloid 
pattern is formed by the following steps : 


(1) transferring a silver halide emulsion layer containing 
substantially non-hardened gelatin and coloured pigment 

particles dispersed therein from a temporary support onto said 
image carrier, 
(2) exposing information-wise the silver halide emulsion layer prior 
to or after carrying out said step (1), 
(3) forming by hardening development a halftone image in said 
transferred silver halide layer and bleach-fixing said layer in 

order to remove developed silver and undeveloped silver halide, 
(4) wash-off processing said transferred layer in order to remove 
selectively unhardened portions of said layer, 
(5) repeating the previous steps in order to form at least partially 
superposed portions of differently coloured gelatin layers.

halftone reprographic image is a black-and-white diffusion transfer 

reversal image formed by the following steps : 

(1) applying an extra colloid layer containing development nuclei to

material ; 
(3) exposing information-wise said negative working silver halide

material and the receptor material provided with said extra 
colloid layer containing development nuclei.
