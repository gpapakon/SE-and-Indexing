<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fuel injection device for a pilot and main injection of identical or different fuel. For this purpose a special injection pump (1), not itself delivering fuel but only generating pressure, and a special two-needle injection valve (9) for each cylinder with valve needles (18, 19) fitted axially parallel side by side and adjusted to different opening pressures, and with a control piston (33) are provided. The latter in a receiver bore (34) is axially freely movable between two limit positions and is responsible both for exact metering of the pilot injection fuel quantity and precisely timed control of the pilot injection, and for a staggered, controlled main injection, starting with and without overlap.

A fuel injection device for pilot and main injection via a respective two-needle injection 
valve into a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, with an injection 

pump with cam-controlled pump pistons rotatable for power control, and the respective 
pump chambers of the said piston pumps are fillable with fuel via a control bore joining 

at the side, and a valve spring-loaded in the closing direction is attached to the end of the 
said pump pistons, 
characterised in that
each two-needle injection valve (9) has two nozzle needles (18, 19) placed parallel to 
the axis and adjacent each other, the rear of each nozzle needle being acted upon by 

force in the closing direction via its own compression spring (20, 21) providing the 
opening pressure, and, when in the closing position supported on a seat they block 

associated nozzle bores (24, 25), and when in the opening position they open the said 
nozzle bores for injection, 
the nozzle antechamber (28) of the pilot injection needle (18) is suppliable with pilot 
injection fuel from low pressure feed means (32) via a channel (30/1, 30/2, 30/3, 30/4), 

inside the valve, fitted with a non-return valve (31) allowing flow only in the feed 
direction, 
a pump exit chamber (8) containing a delivery valve (14) and a compression spring (15) 
is attached to each pump chamber (7) of the injection pump (1), and a supply channel 

(10) inside the injection valve is attached directly or via an injection pipe (11) to the said 
pump exit chamber, 
each delivery valve (14) acting as a pressure piston during the pump piston stroke 
expels the fuel present in the adjacent pipe passages (8, 11, 10), and at the same time 

blocks a filling bore (16) leading to the side of the pump exit chamber (8), and when each 
main injection is completed and the delivery valve (14) has been returned to the closed 

position the resulting cavity, corresponding to the injected main injection fuel quantity, in 
the downstream pipe passages (8, 11, 10) is 
refillable with main injection fuel by low 
pressure feed means (17) via the said filling bore, and 
in each two-needle injection valve (9) a control piston (33) is provided freely movable 
axially between two final positions and is displaceable from its lower final position to  

 
another upper final position, when each main injection is completed, by pilot injection 

fuel supplied to its control antechamber (35) via a channel (38) from the nozzle 
antechamber (28) of the pilot injection needle (18), wherein the supply channel (10) is 

closed, and the said control piston is moved downwards from this upper final position 
when there is a controlled pressure build-up in the pump piston as a result of the waiting 

main injection fuel, wherein the pilot injection fuel waiting in its control antechamber 
(35) is displaced as a result of opening the pilot injection needle (18) and is injected in an 

appropriate quantity, and wherein a connection (36) to the nozzle antechamber (29) of 
the main injection needle (19) is opened by the control piston (33), thus causing the said 

main injection needle to be lifted by the main injection fuel advanced in the pump piston, 
and the said fuel to be injected to the point of pressure relief in the pump piston. 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the opening pressure 
of the pilot injection needle (18) is set lower than the pressure of the main injection 

needle (19) by way of the associated respective compression spring (20, 21). 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the control piston 
(33) is contained in the area between the two valve needles (18, 19) parallel to the axis 

thereto so as to be axially displaceable in a receiving bore (34) correspondingly widened 
at the bottom to form the control antechamber (35), and also widened further up at a 

distance of approximately the length of the control piston (33) from the said control-antechamber 
floor forming the lower stop to form a bridging chamber (36), and 

extending coaxially to the central supply channel (10) with a smaller diameter, wherein 
the passage from the said supply channel to the receiving bore (34) is formed by an insert 

sleeve (37), with the lower end surface thereof forming the upper stop for the control 
piston (33). 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1 and 3, 
characterised in that
 the nozzle 
antechamber (28) of the pilot injection needle (18) is connected via a bore (38) to the 

control antechamber (35) of the control piston (33), and the bridging chamber (36) is 
connected to the nozzle antechamber (29) of the main injection needle (19), depending 

on the distance, by the chambers cutting into each other or by way of a bore.

characterised in that
 the 
control piston (33) is in the form of a step piston to increase the pressure transmission,

cylinder section of smaller diameter (33/2) forms the lower control piston part, and the 

receiving bore (34) is adapted correspondingly in diameter thereto, wherein the said 
receiving bore is widened by a leakage chamber (43) at the level of the transition of the 

two cylinder sections, when viewed in the lower stop position of the control piston (33), 
and a leakage discharge channel (44) leads away from the said leakage chamber. 
A fuel injection device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,

bore is covered by the receiving bore (34) when the control piston (33) is in the upper 

final position, and comes into connection with a leakage chamber (47), formed by an 
annular extension of the receiving bore, with a leakage discharge pipe (48) extending 

therefrom when the control piston (33) moves downwards, and the pressure in the 
control pressure chamber (35) and the nozzle storage chamber (28) thereby fails, thus 

ending pilot injection and enabling the control piston (33) to be returned to its lower stop
