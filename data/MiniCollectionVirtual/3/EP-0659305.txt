<ABSTRACT>
A charger for rechargeable cells or batteries utilizes a mechanism whereby resistance-free voltage is continually monitored during periodic current-off intervals in the charging process and compared to an independent reference voltage to prevent overcharge. After a certain degree of charge has been obtained, the current is gradually reduced to a finishing charge. Several means are provided for terminating the finishing charge while avoiding overcharge. Another embodiment of a charger provides for measurement of the resistance-free voltage during the current-off period after sufficient time is allowed for the recombination of any oxygen which may have been produced during charging, thus taking into account inherent variations in cells of the same type.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to battery chargers, or more particularly to
circuits for charging rechargeable batteries and cells. The rechargeable batteries and
cells that can be recharged from circuits and methods of the present invention may
range in value from very low voltage -- less than 1 or 1.5 volts -- with very low
capacities -- in the order of several hundred mAh -- up to batteries in the range of
from 12 or 24 volts up to several hundred volts, and with capacities in the range of
hundreds to several thousand ampere-hours. The present invention provides circuits
and methods consistent with the above, and provides circuits whereby the rate of
charge current delivered to the rechargeable battery or cell being charged may be in
the range of 10C to 15C, or more, and may be regulated down to a trickle charge. EP-A-No. 0 311 460
teaches a battery charger where a principal
feature is the fact that the battery charger can deliver a current to a rechargeable
battery or cell initially at a rate in amperes greater than the capacity in amperehours
of the battery -- in other words, at a rate greater than 1C. Therefore, the
rechargeable battery or cell being charged may be rapidly charged.Another feature of the previous invention is that means are provided
for detecting the internal resistance free voltage of the rechargeable battery or cell
being charged, and comparing it to a pre-selected reference voltage which is
independent of the battery being charged. In other words, for a particular type and
rating of rechargeable battery or cell to be charged, a reference voltage is pre-selected
and is generated within the charger circuits. (It is possible that the
reference voltage may be pre-selected by switch setting or the like, with prior
knowledge of the condition, rating, and type of rechargeable battery or cell to be
charged.) The resistance free voltage is compared to the internally generated
reference voltage at an instant in time when the charging current being delivered to
the rechargeable battery or cell has been interrupted.The prior invention provides that, as the internal resistance free
voltage of the rechargeable battery or cell being charged exceeds the pre-selected
reference voltage, means are provided to reduce the electrical charging current and
thereby reduce the rate of charging the rechargeable battery or cell, in order to
maintain the internal resistance free voltage at a value equivalent to the pre-selected
reference voltage. In other words, if it is noted that the internal resistance free
