<ABSTRACT>
There are provided diaryl(pyridinio and 
isoquinolinio)boron compounds having the structural 

formula 

and their use for the prevention, control or amelioration 
of diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi.

<DESCRIPTION>
Phytopathogenic fungi are the causal agents
for many diseases that infect and destroy crops. In
particular, the diseases apple scab, grape downy
mildew, tomato early blight and grape and pepper
botrytis are especially devastating.The leaves and fruit of apple trees are
susceptible to attach by a fungus, Venturiainaequalis,
resulting in a disease called apple scab. The disease
occurs wherever apples are grown, but is most common in
the United States and Europe. Uncontrolled, apple scab
results in deformed, low quality fruit.Tomatoes are also susceptible to diseases
caused by fungi. For example, the foliage, stem and
fruit of the tomato plant may be attached by a fungus,
Alternariasolani, resulting in a disease called tomato
early blight. Tomato early blight is particularly
destructive in regions with wet or humid climates.
Uncontrolled, tomato early blight causes the
defoliation of the tomato plant, resulting in reduced
fruit number and size.Grapes and peppers are susceptible to attach
by the fungus, Botrytiscinerea, causing grape botrytis
and pepper botrytis, respectively. Grape botrytis, for
example, is an especially destructive disease that
destroys the cell walls of the fruit, resulting in 
bunch rot. Grape botrytis may occur in any grape
vineyard, but is most prevalent in Europe.In spite of the commercial fungicides available
today, diseases caused by fungi still abound.
Accordingly, there is ongoing research to create new
and more effective fungicides for controlling or
preventing diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi.In addition insects and acarina destroy
growing and harvested crops. In the United States
alone, agronomic crops must compete with thousands of
insect and acarid species. In particular, tobacco
budworms, southern armyworms and two-spotted spider
mites are especially devasting to crops.Tobacco budworms cause tremendous economic
losses in agronomic crops. In particular, budworms
devastate cotton crops by feeding on green bolls.
Control of budworms is complicated by their resistance
to many common insecticides, including organophosphates,
carbamates and pyrethroids. Also, budworm
larvae are difficult to control with currently available
insecticides once they reach the third instar.Two-spotted spider mites attach many plant
species, raspberry plants for example, by removing sap
from leaves. When raspberry plants are heavily infested,
canes and leaves become stunted. With a severe
infestation, fruiting canes are damaged, resulting in
reduced yield and fruit quality.US-A-3,062,708 and
