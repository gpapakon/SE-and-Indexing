<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuits. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an integrated circuit topology
for implementing a differential gain stage in an integrated circuit using a
standard bipolar ECL process which has no dedicated MOS capacitor oxide
step.Differential amplifiers according to the prior art have a
peaking frequency response which is dependent on a capacitor. For the
amplifier to have a good common mode rejection ratio (CMRR), the
impedances of the admitter current sources should remain high for all
frequencies of operation for the amplifier. While it is generally not a
problem to achieve this with modern high-speed bipolar processes, the
presence of the capacitor does pose some difficulties with respect to the
physical implementation of the circuit in a monolithic integrated circuit
form.The difficulty arises from the inherent inability to
fabricate a true floating capacitor structure using a standard bipolar
integrated circuit fabrication process. All known practical
implementations result in some additional and unwanted parasitic
capacitance between the capacitor structure and the external nodes, e.g.
usually the substrate node of the integrated circuit. This unwanted
parasitic capacitance appears as a shunt with the emitter current sources 
thereby causing a reduction in impedance, and a consequent reduction in
the common mode rejection ratio of the amplifier when operating at high
frequencies.While small signal analysis of the amplifier may suggest
that a high common mode rejection ratio can be maintained provided
there is symmetry in the capacitor structure (i.e. leading to a cancellation
of the unwanted common mode terms in the differential output), the
non-linearities in the large-signal transfer function of the amplifier stage
lead to an undesirable mixing of the common-mode and differential-mode
signals. Under these conditions, the effective common mode
rejection ratio can drop to an unacceptably low figure. Therefore, the
physical implementation of a differential gain stage in a monolithic
integrated circuit remains a problem.GB-A-2 151 865 suggests a differentiating resistor circuit for compensating the parasitic capacitances.The present invention provides a "bootstrapping" circuit
which is applied in conjunction with a three-plate MOS capacitor structure
to produce a topology which can substantially reduce the undesirable
effects of the parasitic capacitance of the capacitor on the performance of
the amplifier.The circuit technique, according
