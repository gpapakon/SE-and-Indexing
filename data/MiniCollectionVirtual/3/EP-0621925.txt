<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydraulic 
control system and more particularly to a hybrid 
system having a combination of poppet and spool type 
valves for actuation of a hydraulic motor according to the preamble of claims 1 an control system is known from DE-A-2 609 434. Many hydraulic circuits for controlling a 
reversible hydraulic motor typically include a three 
position, four way directional control valve having a 
single spool for controlling fluid flow from a pump to 
the motor and from the motor to a tank, a pair of line 
reliefs operatively associated with opposite sides of 
the reversible hydraulic motor, load check valves to 
block reverse flow of fluid if the load pressure is 
higher than the pump pressure at the time the 
directional control valve is shifted, and makeup 
valves for providing makeup fluid to a cavitated side 
of a motor in an overrunning condition. One of the problems encountered with such 
circuit is that the use of all those valves to achieve 
the desired operating parameters of a single circuit 
generally adds to the cost of each circuit. Another 
problem encountered is that the directional control 
valve commonly has a single spool with the timing of 
the metering slots designed to optimize the control of 
the pump-to-motor fluid flow. Thus the spool is 
generally inadequate for metering motor-to-tank fluid 
flow in an overrunning load condition.  
 Other hydraulic circuits for controlling 
reversible hydraulic motors include a plurality of 
poppet type valves, usually four, for controlling 
pump-to-motor fluid flow and from motor-to-tank fluid 
flow. Although the poppet type valves in those 
circuits reduce the number of valves needed, poppet 
type valves are generally difficult to control for 
precisely metering fluid flow therethrough. In view of the above, it would be desirable 
to have a hydraulic circuit which utilizes the 
advantageous features of both poppet valves and spool 
valves within a single hydraulic system. The present invention is directed to 
overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth 
above. In one aspect of the present invention, a 
hydraulic control system for controllable actuation of 
a hydraulic motor having first and second actuating 
chambers includes a spool type control valve having an 
inlet port, a tank port, and first and second motor 
ports. The control valve has a neutral position at 
which the motor ports communicate with the tank port 
and the inlet port is blocked from the tank port and 
the motor ports. The control valve is
