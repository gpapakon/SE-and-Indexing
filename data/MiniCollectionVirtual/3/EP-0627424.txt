<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel pyridazinone 
derivatives, and insecticidal and miticidal compositions 
containing said derivatives as an active ingredient. Of pyridazinone derivatives, some are known as 
effective insecticidal and miticidal compounds. For 
example, Japanese Unexamined Patent publication 
No. 17570/1986 discloses 2-t-butyl-4-chloro-5-(4-n-hexyl)benzylthio-3(2H)-pyridazinone, 
etc., and Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No.27736/1987 discloses 2-t-butyl-4-chloro-5-(4-vinyl)benzylthio-3(2H)-pyridazinone, 
etc. However, these compounds are unsatisfactory in 
potency. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel pyridazinone derivative having a high insecticidal and 
miticidal activity against various agricultural noxious 
insects. In view of the foregoing situation, the inventors of 
the present invention conducted extensive research on  
 
pyridazinone derivatives to develop compounds having a high 
insecticidal and miticidal activity against various 
agricultural noxious insects and found that a pyridazinone 
derivative represented by the formula (1) 
wherein R is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxyalkyl 
group or a phenyl group which may have 1 or 2 substituents 
in an optional position is a novel compound undisclosed in 
literature and has a potent insecticidal and miticidal 
activity. Then the inventors confirmed that the compound of 
the formula (1) gives a potent killing effect on resistant 
vermin which have caused agricultural problems and the 
compound has a low toxicity. The present invention has been 
completed on the basis of this novel finding. The compound of the formula (1) according to the 
present invention is useful as an insecticidal and miticidal 
agent. The compound of the invention shows a particularly 
high insecticidal activity against noxious insects such as 
those of the order Lepidoptera, e.g. Adoxophyes sp., 
Plutella xylostella, Pieris rapae crucivora, Autographa 
nigrisigna, Spodoptera exigua, Spodoptera litura, etc., the  
 
order Coleoptera, e.g. Cororado potato beetle, Mexican bean 
beetle, etc., the order Hemiptera, e.g. Myzus persicae, 
Aphis gossypii, Aphis craccivora, Nephotettix cincticeps, 
Empoasca onukii, Laodelphax striatellus, Sogatella 
furcifera, Nilaparvata lugens, Trialeurodes vaporariorum, 
Bemisia tabaci, etc., the order Thysanoptera, e.g. Thrips 
palmi, Scirtothrips dorsalis, etc., the order Tetranychidae, 
e.g. Tetranychus urticae, Tetranychus kansawai, Panonychus 
citri, etc., the order Eriophyidae, e.g.
