<ABSTRACT>
Faulty or missing welding operations are unavoidable on automatic welding stations of a production line. This is often only recognized after the workpiece passes through further automatic or manual processing stations, if, for example, a nut is to be screwed onto a bolt which by mistake has not been welded on. The later a missing or faulty welding operation on a production line is recognized, the greater are the costs involved in rectifying the fault. So that such missing or faulty welding operations can be recognized earlier, the welding device of a welding station is equipped with a spray gun which sprays a colour marking right beside the intended welding point in the event of a missing or faulty welding operation. The colour marking is visually detected at the next processing station occupied by a worker so that the faulty workpiece can be rejected from the production line. The consequent costs of missing or faulty welding operations can thereby be considerably reduced.
