<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a highly machinable, prehardened, 
martensitic steel article used for metal die casting die 
components and other hot work tooling components, and to a method 
for producing the same. The typical method of manufacture of die components used for 
die casting, including light metals such as aluminum, and for 
other types of hot work tooling components consists of rough 
machining the component close to finish dimensions from a hot work: 
tool steel die block, hardening the rough-machined component by a 
quenching and tempering type of heat treatment, and finally 
machining the hardened component to finish dimensions. The 
performance and longevity of die components so manufactured are 
significantly affected by two features of this manufacturing 
procedure, namely, the quenching rate employed to harden the 
component1/2/
 
and the technique used to finish machine the  
 
component.3/
 
For AISI hot work tool steels, rapid quenching rates 
are required to produce the martensitic microstructure necessary 
for long service life. Slow quenching rates minimize size change 
and distortion of the rough-machined component, and thereby reduce 
the amount, severity, and cost of the finish machining operation. 
The slow quenching rates, however, also reduce service life, 
because they introduce nonmartensitic constituents into the 
microstructure of the steel. The size change and distortion of 
quenched, rough-machined die components can be eliminated while 
maintaining the optimum, rapidly-quenched, martensitic 
microstructure by manufacturing the die components from 
prehardened hot work tool steel die blocks. Prehardened die blocks made from conventional, resulfurized 
AISI H13 hot work tool steel are currently available. The sulfur 
additions in the steel make it machinable at the high hardness 
needed for die casting applications (35 to 50 HRC), but die 
components manufactured from the currently available prehardened 
die blocks exhibit short service life because the sulfur in the 
steel reduces thermal fatigue resistance and impact toughness, 
which in turn reduce die performance and die service life.4/
 
Figures 1 and 2 are excerpted from this reference  and show the 
detrimental effect of higher sulfur content on the thermal fatigue  
 
resistance of AISI H13 hot work tool steel. Similarly, Figure 3 
is also from this reference and shows the detrimental effect of 
increasing sulfur content on the dynamic fracture toughness of 
AISI H13. This reference concludes that: "Higher sulfur
