<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the invention the birefringence induced by 
compressive strain in silica waveguides on silicon substrates is 

compensated with a 
high index patch -- such as silicon nitride layer -- placed adjacent the 

core. The patch is 
disposed sufficiently close to the core to optically couple with the 

transmitted optical 
mode. The patch is preferably wider than the core to intersect the 

exponential tail of 
the transmitted optical mode. Such a high index patch preferentially 

couples TE 
polarization modes. By choosing an appropriate length for the patch, 

both strain and 

bend birefringence can be compensated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polarization independent integrated optical
devices. The invention is particularly useful for providing filters and multiplexers
with a polarization independent spectral response.As optical fiber communications channels increasingly replace metal
cable and microwave transmission links, integrated optical devices for directly
processing optical signals become increasingly important. A particularly useful
approach to optical processing is through the use of integrated glass waveguide
structures formed on silicon substrates. The basic structure of such devices is
described in C. H. Henry et al., "Glass Waveguides on Silicon for Hybrid Optical
Packaging", 7J.LightwaveTechnol., pp. 1530-1539 (1989). In essence a silicon
substrate is provided with a base layer of SiO2, and a thin core layer of doped silica
glass is deposited on the oxide. The core layer can be configured to a desired
waveguide structure--typically 5-7 micrometers wide--using standard
photolithographic techniques, and a layer of doped silica glass is deposited on the
core to act as a top cladding. Depending on the precise configuration of the
waveguide, such devices can perform a wide variety of functions such as beam
splitting, tapping, multiplexing, demultiplexing and filtering.One shortcoming of such devices, however, is birefringence induced in
the waveguide core by compressive strain. The effect of this birefringence is that
different polarization modes of transmitted light are presented with different
effective indices of refraction. Specifically, the transverse magnetic mode (TM)
encounters a greater effective index than does the transverse electric (TE) mode.The dispersive effect is further aggravated by curves in the waveguide.
When traversing a curve, optical modes are shifted radially outward. A mode loosely
bound to the waveguide core (TM) will experience a greater outward shift than a
mode more tightly bound (TE) with the consequence that the loosely bound mode
has a greater optical path length and phase.A number of techniques have been suggested for overcoming the
intrinsic birefringence of glass-on-silicon waveguides. One method employs a half-wave
plate inserted in the middle of a waveguide grating multiplexer to rotate the 
polarization by 90°. See H. Takahashi et al., "Polarization-Insensitive Arrayed-Waveguide
Multiplexer on Silicon", Opt.Letts., 17 (7), p. 499 (1992). This
approach leads to excessive loss. Another approach is to deposit on the waveguide a
thick layer (several microns) of strain
