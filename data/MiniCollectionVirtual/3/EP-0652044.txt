<ABSTRACT>
The novel process for the work up of solutions or suspensions of organic synthesis products which have a pH of 
<
3, preferably 
<
1, is carried out using an asymmetric, semipermeable membrane made of cyclic polyureas having repeating structural units of the formula (I)

Process for producing the membrane of Claim 1,
characterized in that a solution of a cyclic

polyurea with structural repeat units of the
formula (I) as set forth in Claim 1 is cast onto a

polyphenylene sulphide nonwoven in a layer
thickness from 100 to 500 µm.
Process for purifying and/or concentrating
solutions or suspensions of organic synthesis

products having a pH of 
<
3, characterized in that 
the purifying and/or concentrating is carried out

with the aid of a semipermeable membrane as claimed
in Claim 1, said membrane being operated as an

ultrafiltration or nanofiltration membrane.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the solution or suspension contains 2 to 30% of

sulphuric acid and has a pH from 0 to 2.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the solution or suspension has a temperature from

20 to 40°C.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the organic synthesis products are dyes or optical

brighteners.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the organic synthesis products are reactive dyes.
Use of the membranes of Claim 1 for purifying
and/or concentrating the solutions or suspensions

of organic synthesis products.
