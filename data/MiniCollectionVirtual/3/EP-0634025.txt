<ABSTRACT>
A non-reciprocal optical phase shifter is disclosed, together with various applications. The phase shifter includes direction dependent and independent polarisation rotating devices (52, 53) in parallel optical paths which are recombined, so that the relative phase shift of the output signal depends on the direction of propagation. The device can be employed to form simple isolators, bidirectional wavelength dependent isolators, circulators, and enables bidirectional communications down a single fibre at different wavelengths without polarisation selection. Bulk optics and fibre implementations are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS TO OPTICAL PHASE SHIFTING Technical FieldThe present invention relates to optical systems, including phase shifters, isolators, circulators and bi-directional communication systems, particularly but not exclusively for optical fibre communication systems. Background ArtAn optical isolator is an important component in many optical systems, including communications applications and bulk lasers. The role of the isolator is to allow transmission of light in only one direction. Isolators are used in communications systems to prevent feedback resulting from reflections returning to a laser diode, and are used in conjunction with optical amplifiers to ensure there is no lasing or noise degradations due to feedback. A typical amplifier may have a conventional isolator at its input, its output or both input and output. It is not practically possible to operate a very high gain amplifier without isolation because of residual reflections and scattering.The most common type of prior art isolator relies on the Faraday effect to achieve non reciprocal rotation of the polarisation state of light. In the presence of an applied magnetic field the polarisation of light is rotated in a direction independent of the propagation direction, and proportional to the Verde constant of the material in which the light propagates. By using a crystal with a high Verde constant, a rotation of 45 degrees can be effected in a short distance. A single polarisation isolator can be constructed as shown in Figure 1. Light travelling from left to right is polarised in the vertical direction, then rotated by 45 degrees by the Faraday rotator. A second polariser is placed at this angle, allowing the light to pass undisturbed. Light travelling from right to left is polarised in the 45 degree direction, then rotated by the Faraday element a further 45 degrees, so that it is now in the horizontal plane. This light will be completely blocked by the vertical polarisation so there will be no transmission in the right to left direction.One technique for achieving polarisation independent isolation is 

to split incident light into two polarisation components, isolating each of the components, and then recombining the two polarisation components. The polarisation splitters themselves may act as the polarisers for the isolators, so a polarisation independent isolator can be constructed as shown in Figure 2.Whilst such isolators are essential in many amplification applications, they negate the possibility of two way communication down a
