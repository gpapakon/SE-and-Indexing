<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to mammography biopsy
systems that are designed to detect and obtain cell or
tissue samples from non-palpable lesions of the female
breast. More particularly, this invention is directed to
an advanced mammographic needle biopsy system incorporating
a motorized biopsy needle positioner that automatically
positions a biopsy needle to allow insertion to an
identified point of interest in a patient's breast that is
under examination.Mammographic needle biopsy systems, such as the prior
Mammotest system manufactured and marketed by Fischer
Imaging Corporation, Denver, Colorado, employ a computer-digitizer
system to digitize the location of a point of
interest within the patient's breast as that point of
interest appears on a pair of stereo x-rays of the breast
and to thereafter compute the three-dimensional or spatial
coordinates of that point of interest and display them to
the user. The user then manually sets these three-dimensional
coordinates into respective position controls 
for a puncture instrument assembly and inserts a biopsy or
other needle to the identified point of interest. These
manual systems are susceptible to human error in setting
the computed coordinates of the point of interest into the
puncture instrument. In addition, manual setting of the
coordinates of the point of interest is a time consuming
operation that is frustrating to the patient, who is
required to continue holding a position in which one of her
breasts is under compression. Also, the clinician user is
not permitted the flexibility of inserting the biopsy
needle to a point within the patient's breast that is
slightly offset from the previously identified point of
interest because the coordinates provided by the computer-digitizer
correspond only to the identified point of
interest. It will be appreciated that such offset
insertion in the present invention facilitates multiple
pass sapling of a breast lesion using a driven biopsy
instrument or other biopsy instrument as may be desired.EP 0 390 652 discloses a method for using a light table for x-ray
photography which finds application particularly in studying stereographic
photographs for mammography. This method leads to the determination of the
three-dimensional coordinates of a point within a breast starting from a
stereographic photograph of the same. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a motorized biopsy needle positioner for
mammographic needle biopsy systems that includes a control
unit for enabling the user to manually
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for performing medical procedures on a
patient's breast, comprising:


a) an image display console (200) for displaying a first image
(208) of said patient's breast corresponding to a first viewpoint

and displaying a second image (210) of said patient's breast

corresponding to a second viewpoint;
b) a cursor device (202) for generating position input
signals including positional information regarding locations of

interest within said patient's breast, said cursor device (202)
providing a visual cue which is positionable relative to said

displayed images, wherein positional data relative to a position
of said visual cue is obtained by activating said cursor device;
c) a calculator, interconnected to the cursor device (202),
for receiving the position input signals from the cursor device

and calculating corresponding coordinates of the locations of
interest within the patient's breast; and
d) coordinates calculator logic means into said calculator
for receiving target position input signals from said cursor

device (202) identifying a target area of interest relative to
both of said first and second images and calculating three-dimensional

target coordinates of said location of interest based
on said received first position input signals, characterized in

that said apparatus includes:
e) offset coordinates calculator logic means into said
calculator for receiving an offset position input signal from said

cursor device (202) identifying an offset position relative to one
of said first and second images and calculating three-dimensional 

offset coordinates of an offset location of interest based on said
coordinates of said target position input signals and said offset

position input signal; and
f) a motorized medical instrument positioning system for inserting a
medical instrument to said target area of interest and said offset

position based on the target coordinates and offset coordinates
determined by the calculator.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said calculator is
further operative using said visual cue of said cursor device

(202) to determine an offset direction relative to said target
area of interest, wherein said offset direction is defined by said

target location and said offset position, and to determine an
offset location based on repeated signals from said cursor device.
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising means for
digitally storing information regarding said target location and

offset position for use in subsequent insertion of medical
instrument within said patient's breast.
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a table
(120) for supporting a patient in a prone position, the table

having a breast aperture (146) therein through which one of
patient's breast is permitted to pendulantly protrude.
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising means for
immobilizing said patient's breast using a compression device.
Method for operating an apparatus according to anyone of
claims 1 to 5, said method comprising the steps of:


a) digitizing on the calculator an identified point of
interest within the patient's breast for computing the spatial

coordinates thereof; 
b) automatically setting, by means of the cursor device
(202), the motorized medical instrument positioning mechanism for

positioning said medical instrument on said identified point of
interest;
c) entering in the calculator one or more offsets relative
to the desired coordinate axes;
d) moving the medical instrument positioning mechanism to
the offset location based on the entered offsets;
e) optionally repeating the operations at point c) and d)
above.
Method according to claim 6, said method further
comprising the step of:


f) optionally returning the medical instrument positioning
mechanism to the original identified point of interest by means of

an operator hand controller.
