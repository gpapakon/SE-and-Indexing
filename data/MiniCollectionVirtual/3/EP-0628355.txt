<ABSTRACT>
The head (1) for dispensing product comprises an end-piece (2) intended to be placed on a container (5) which contains the product to be dispensed, this end-piece (2) including a bottom (4) equipped with a sleeve (6) into which is fixed, by snap-fitting, a component (11) to which a pump (14) is connected; sealing means (8) are provided between the end-piece (2) and the component (11) in order to interact when this component (11) has been snap-fitted onto the sleeve (6) of the end-piece. The end-piece includes retaining means (R) suitable for keeping, prior to snap-fitting, the abovementioned component in a position in which the sealing means (8) between component and end-piece do not yet interact and passage means (16) are provided between the outer surface of the component (11) and the inner surface of the sleeve (6) into which the component is engaged in the pre-snap-fitting position in order to maintain communication between the inside of the container (5) and the outside, in this pre-snap-fitting position.

<CLAIMS>
Head for dispensing a product, comprising a 
nozzle piece intended to be placed on a container (5, 

105, 205) containing the product to be dispensed, this 
nozzle piece including a base (4, 104, 204) equipped with 

a sleeve (6, 106, 206) in which is fastened, by snap-fitting, 
a component to which a pump (14, 114, 214) is 

linked, sealing means being provided between the nozzle 
piece (2, 102, 202) and the component (11, 111, 211) in 

order to interact when this component has been snap-fitted 
on the sleeve of the nozzle piece, characterized 

in that the nozzle piece (2, 102, 202) includes retention 
means (R) capable of holding the abovementioned component 

(11, 111, 211) in a pre-snap-fitting position in which 
the sealing means (8, 108, 208) between component and 

nozzle piece do not yet interact and in that passage 
means (16, 116, 216) are provided between the outer 

surface of the component (11, 111, 211) and the inner 
surface of the sleeve (6, 106, 206) in which the component 

is engaged in the pre-snap-fitting position in order 
to maintain a communication between the inside of the 

container (5, 105, 205) bind the outside, in this pre-snap-fitting 
position. 
Head according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
sealing means comprise a sealing lip (8, 108, 208) 

forming a cylindrical skirt coaxial with the nozzle 
piece, provided at the centre of the base (4, 104, 204) 

of the nozzle piece (2, 102, 202) around a passage 
opening (7, 107, 207), this lip (8, 108, 208) being 

capable of being flattened in a leaktight manner against 
the inner cylindrical surface of the component (11, 111, 

211) when the latter is snap-fitted on the nozzle piece, 
the retention means (R) being capable of holding the 

component in a pre-snap-fitting position such that the 
lower edge of the component is above the sealing lip (8, 

108, 208). 
Head according to Claim 2, characterized in that 

the retention means (R) comprise a peripheral bead (17, 
117, 217) provided on the inner wall of the sleeve (6,  

 
106, 206) of the nozzle piece capable of retaining the 

lower edge of the component (11, 111, 211) in the pre-snap-fitting 
position, the crossing of this bead being 

possible by exerting a sufficient force. 
Head according to one of the preceding claims, in 
which the component (11, 111, 211) has a cylindrical 

shape capable of matching the inner surface of the 
sleeve, characterized in that the passage means (16, 116, 

216) are arranged in order to determine longitudinal 
channels between the said surfaces, ensuring communication 

between the inside of the container (5, 105, 205) 
and the outside when the component (11, 111, 211) is in 

the pre-snap-fitting position. 
Head according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the passage means comprise longitudinal grooves (16, 116, 

216) provided on the outer surface of the component (11, 
111, 211), parallel to the generatrices of this component, 

the length of these grooves (16, 116, 216) being 
sufficient for their upper end to be above the upper edge 

of the sleeve (6, 106, 206) of the nozzle piece when the 
component (11, 111, 211) is in the pre-snap-fitting 

position. 
Head according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the abovementioned component (11) 

is independent of the pump body which is fastened on the 
said component, particularly by crimping. 
Head according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the abovementioned component (111, 211) 

forms an integral part of the pump body and consists of 
a cylindrical skirt which is snap-fitted directly into 

the sleeve (106, 206) of the nozzle piece. 
Product dispenser, particularly for a pasty 
product, characterized in that it is equipped with a head 

(1) according to one of the preceding claims.
