<ABSTRACT>
A tripot universal joint (10) for 
transmitting torque between two rotatable shafts 

(12,14) comprising a substantially annular outer 
housing (16) connectable to one of the shafts; a 

substantially annular inner race (18) positioned 
inside the outer housing and connectable to the other 

of the shafts, the inner race having three slots (30) 
therein which extend longitudinally; a spider member 

(26) positioned inside the inner race and having three 
trunnions (28) each of which extend in a radial 

direction through one of the slots, the spider member 
being pivotable relative to the inner race; a roller 

ball (34) rotatable on each trunnion and slidable in 
the respective slot; a substantially annular ball cage 

(24) positioned between the inner race and the outer 
housing and secured to the trunnions; and a plurality 

of balls (58) retained by the ball cage in 
longitudinally extending grooves (54) in the outer 

housing, the balls being rotatable to allow the ball 
cage and the spider member to translate in a 

longitudinal direction relative to the outer housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a universal joint
of the tripot type for the transmission of torque
between two rotatable shafts. The present invention
has particular application in motor vehicles, and in
particular for providing drive to steerable driven
wheels on a motor vehicle.It is well known to provide a universal
joint of the tripot type between two rotatable shafts.
A tripot joint typically comprises an outer housing or
race connectable to one shaft, three radially
extending trunnions connectable to the other shaft by
way of a spider member which is splined to the other
shaft, and rollers rotatable on the trunnions and
axially slidable in channels in the outer housing. In
such a tripot joint, numerous needle bearings are
typically provided between each trunnion and its
associated roller to provide the required stroking and
angulation function between the two shafts. This
arrangement has disadvantages in terms of the number
of components and the dynamic interaction between the
stroking and angulation functions. Examples of prior
art arrangements can be found in EP-A-0244064;
EP-A-0279127; and EP-A-0290142.
FR-A-2448658 discloses a tripot joint in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a universal joint which overcomes the above
disadvantages.To this end, a tripot universal joint for
transmitting torque between two rotatable shafts in
accordance with the present invention comprises a
substantially annular outer housing connectable to one
of the shafts; a substantially annular inner race
positioned inside the outer housing and connectable to
the other of the shafts, the inner race having three
slots therein which extend longitudinally; a spider
member positioned inside the inner race and having 
three trunnions each of which extend in a radial
direction through one of the slots, the spider member
being pivotable relative to the inner race; a roller
ball rotatable on each trunnion and slidable in the
respective slot; a substantially annular ball cage
positioned between the inner race and the outer
housing and secured to the trunnions; and a plurality
of balls retained by the ball cage in longitudinally
extending grooves in the outer housing, the balls
being rotatable to allow the ball cage and the spider
member to translate in a longitudinal direction
relative to the outer housing.The present invention provides the required
stroking and angulation of a standard tripot universal
joint, but minimises the interaction between these two
functions by allowing

<CLAIMS>
A tripot universal joint (10) for
transmitting torque between two rotatable shafts

(12,14) comprising a substantially annular outer
housing (16) connectable to one of the shafts; a

substantially annular inner race (18) positioned
inside the outer housing and connectable to the other

of the shafts, the inner race having three slots (30)
therein which extend longitudinally; a spider member

(26) positioned inside the inner race and having three
trunnions (28) each of which extend in a radial

direction through one of the slots, the spider member
being pivotable relative to the inner race; and a roller

ball (34) rotatable on each trunnion and slidable in
the respective slot; characterised by a substantially annular ball cage

(24) positioned between the inner race and the outer
housing and secured to the trunnions; and a plurality

of balls (58) retained by the ball cage in
longitudinally extending grooves (54) in the outer

housing, the balls being rotatable to allow the ball
cage and the spider member to translate in a

longitudinal direction relative to the outer housing.
A tripot universal joint as claimed in
Claim 1, wherein there are three longitudinally

extending grooves (54) in the outer housing (16), the
grooves being substantially equidistantly spaced

apart.
A tripot universal joint as claimed in
Claim 2, wherein the trunnions (28) are each

positioned substantially centrally between adjacent
grooves (54).
A tripot universal joint as claimed in
any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the ball cage (24)

has grooves (56) corresponding to the grooves (54) in 
the outer housing (16), the balls (58) being rotatable

in both sets of grooves.
A tripot universal joint as claimed in
any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein retaining rings (60)

retain the balls (58) in the grooves (54).
A tripot universal joint as claimed in
any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the spider member

(26) is retained in the inner race (18) by a spring
retainer clip (46) which clips to the inner race.
A tripot universal joint as claimed in
Claim 6, wherein the spring retainer clip (46) biases

the spider member (26) into contact with the inner
race (18) of the said other shaft.
A tripot universal joint as claimed in
Claim 7, wherein the spider member (26) has a

part-spherical surface (38) which contacts a
corresponding concave surface (42) on the inner race

(18) or an end of the said other shaft.
A tripot universal joint as claimed in
Claim 8, wherein the part-spherical surface (38) is

defined by separate button member (40) attached to the
spider member (26).
