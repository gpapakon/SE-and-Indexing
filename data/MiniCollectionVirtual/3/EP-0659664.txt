<ABSTRACT>
Articles, such as 
glass or plastic bottles (10), are conveyed in single file to 

an accumulating area (14), with the containers at the 
accumulating area being formed into a pattern, preferably 

in nested relationship. A conveyor system (16) is provided to 
urge articles from the accumulating area (14) to, and 

partially through, a sweep area (18), and a movable retainer 
unit (20) having retractable plungers (46) is provided to control 

the movement of articles from the accumulating area (14) by 
groups to the sweep area (18) with the sweep area having a 

positioner unit (22) thereat that includes a plurality of 
movable sweep arms (60,62,64,66,68) adjacent ones of which are 

utilized to 
engage the first and last rows of each group of articles 

to capture each group therebetween and thereafter conduct 
each group of articles through the sweep area to a pallet 

loading area (24) where each group is successively deposited 
as a layer on a pallet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to palletizing articles,
and, more particularly, relates to palletizing unstable
articles such as containers.It is oftentimes necessary to convey articles
between different locations and/or form the articles into
a suitable arrangement for a particular purpose. Where
fairly stable articles, such as cylindrical cans or
bottles, are to be conveyed from location to location, it
is well known that such articles can often be conveyed
along a belt from one location to another at a fairly
fast rate.It is also now known that conveyed cylindrical
articles such as containers can be formed into a single
line (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,500,229,
4,730,955 and Re. 32,684) or formed into a plurality of
rows, including being formed into a nested relationship
(see U.S. Patent Nos. 2,535,880, 3,685,632, 4,721,419,
4,834,605 and 4,934,508).It is likewise known that articles can be repeatedly
conveyed by groups, or tiers, of articles to a pallet 
(see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,759,673, 4,834,605
and 4,934,508), and that tiers of articles can be
conveyed to a pallet using a sweep arrangement (see, for
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,934,713 and 4,978,275).U.S. Patent No. 3,934,713 discloses a method and
apparatus for palletizing articles. Briefly, the
apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,934,713
conveys a first group of articles from an article-receiving
station to a transfer station; thereafter
transfers said first group of articles on to a support
member; and, before completing the transfer of said
first group, conveys a second group of articles from
the receiving station to the transfer station: The
following claims have been characterized in view of
U.S. Patent No. 3,934,713.It is also known that groups of articles can be
stacked in vertical layers on a pallet with a sheet
placed between each layer formed by a group of articles
(see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,759,673 and
4,809,965).Likewise, it is known that unstable articles can be
palletized (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,667,808).This invention provides improved device and method
for palletizing articles and, more particularly, relates
to palletizing unstable containers at a faster speed than
heretofore possible.The device includes accumulating means, conveying
means for conveying articles through an accumulating area 
and a sweep area, retainer means to repeatedly allow
groups having a preselected number of articles to pass
from the accumulating area to the sweep area with the
retainer means leading each group of
