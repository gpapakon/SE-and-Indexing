<ABSTRACT>
Pulse width modulation is used to control the flow rate through a solenoid expansion valve (24) in a refrigeration system (10) using a dual evaporator, two-stage cycle. The refrigeration cycle (10) includes a phase separator (22) which receives two-phase refrigerant from the low temperature evaporator (20) and supplies liquid refrigerant to the pulse width modulated solenoid valve (24). A liquid level sensor (34) is disposed in the phase separator (22), and a controller (32) for controlling the duty cycle of the pulse width modulated solenoid valve (24) is provided to receive input from the liquid level sensor (34). The liquid level sensor (34) can be of the type which provides a continuously variable signal as a function of liquid level, or it can be a liquid level switch which controls valve duty cycle on the basis of whether the phase separator liquid level is above or below a set level. Alternatively, two liquid level switches (34a, 34b) can be provided.

As used herein, the term "refrigeration system" refers to refrigerators, air conditioners or any other system which produces a refrigeration effect.Conventional refrigeration systems used in household refrigerators typically operate on the simple vapor compression cycle which includes a compressor, a condenser, an expansion device, and an evaporator all connected in series in the order given. Refrigerator air is blown across the evaporator and the air flow is controlled so that part of the air flow goes to the freezer compartment and the remainder of the air flow goes to the fresh food compartment . The refrigerator cycle, therefore, produces its refrigeration effect at a temperature which is appropriate for the freezer compartment, but lower than it needs to be for the fresh food compartment. 

Since the mechanical energy required to produce cooling at low temperatures is greater than it is at higher temperatures, the simple vapor compression cycle uses more mechanical energy than one which produces cooling at two temperature levels.A refrigeration cycle suitable for use in a household refrigerator and having improved thermodynamic efficiency is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,910,972, issued March 27, 1990 to Heinz Jaster and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention. The cycle disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,910,972 comprises first and second compressors, a condenser, a first expansion device, a first evaporator, a phase separator, a second expansion device, and a second evaporator all connected in series in the order given. The phase separator receives two phase refrigerant from the first evaporator and provides liquid refrigerant to the second expansion device and saturated vapor refrigerant to the second compressor. The first evaporator is operated at approximately 25°F and cools the fresh food compartment; the second evaporator is operated at approximately
