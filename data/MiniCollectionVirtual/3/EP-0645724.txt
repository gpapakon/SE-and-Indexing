<ABSTRACT>
For delivering parts successively received in shipment 
units by parts deliverer to part use positions, the 

delivering operation time required for each parts deliverer 
is uniformalized. A uniformalizing plan is produced, and 

the delivering operation is continued according to the plan. 

The delivering operation time is calculated for each 
shipment unit (first step). The assignment of shipment 

units to parts deliverers is shifted such as to uniformalize 
the delivering operation time for each parts deliverer 

(third step). The shifting operation is continued until 
uniformalizing is obtained. As a result, uniformalized 

assignment can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to techniques of delivering
parts in an assembling plant.In an assembling plant, parts transported from parts
factories are received in a parts reception place, and the
received parts are delivered to places where they are used.
This status is illustrated in FIG. 1. As shown, parts W1,
W2, ... which are transported by trucks or the like from
parts factories, are successively received in a parts
reception place 11 and transferred to delivery wagons 12.
The parts transferred onto the delivery wagons 12 are
delivered to parts use positions L1 to Ln by parts
deliverers 14, 15, ... running along a course 13 extending
along the parts use positions L1 to Ln. The delivered parts
W1, W2, ... are used at parts use position L1 to Ln,
respectively, for assembling a product or products.Normally, the parts deliverers 14, 15, ... are
scheduled to depart from the parts reception place 11 at
predetermined time instants. The transportation of the
parts W1, W2, ... from parts factories, however, is not 
always scheduled by taking the time required for the
delivering operation of the parts deliverers 14, 15, ...
into considerations. Therefore, if the parts deliverers 14,
15, ... are managed under a rule that all parts existing at
the parts reception place 11 at a timing when each parts
deliverers 14, 15, ... departs from the parts reception
place 11, the time required for the delivering operation by
the parts deliverers is not constant, but some deliverers
may require long times for the delivering operation while
other may require short times.FIG. 1 shows a case in which the parts W1 to W4 have
already been received in the parts reception place 11 at the
time of the departure of the parts deliverer 14, while the
parts W5 are delivered after the departure of the parts
deliverer 14 and before the departure of the parts deliverer
15. In this case, if all the parts W1 to W4 are delivered
by the parts deliverer 14, the delivering operation is
excessive for the parts deliverer 14 while it is
insufficient for the next parts deliverer 15. As shown in
FIG. 1, the burden of the delivering operation may be
averaged by changing the deliverer for the parts W4 from the
deliverer 14 to the deliverer 15.When excessive parts have been received in the parts
reception place 11 as in the above case, it is in practice
in the prior art that the personnel in charge of the parts 
delivery determines parts to be delivered by the parts
deliverer 14 at this time and other parts which are to be
left for the next parts deliverer
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of scheduling a plurality of parts
deliverers, each parts deliverer delivering a plurality

of parts received at a part reception place in shipment
units to parts use positions comprising:


a first step of calculating the delivering operation time required for
delivering parts included in each shipment unit based

upon a number of boxes of parts included in the shipment
unit and a number of the parts use positions therein to

which the parts included in the shipment unit are to be
delivered;
a second step of calculating the delivering
operation time for each parts deliverer by accumulating

delivering operation times calculated in said first step with
respect to shipment units to be received between two

parts deliverers;
a third step of shifting a shipment unit between the
two parts deliverers so as to make the delivering

operation times for parts deliverers uniform;
a fourth step of calculating the delivering
operation time for each parts deliverer afresh by

accumulating delivering operation times calculated in said first
step with respect to shipment units assigned to the parts

deliverers after the shipment unit assignment has been
shifted in said third step; and 
repeating said third and fourth steps until a
predetermined uniform level among delivering o
peration
times for parts deliverers as calculated in said fourth

step is realized.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said
third step is executed such that each shipment unit is

assigned to either one of a predetermined number of
successive parts deliverers subsequent to a parts

reception timing, and wherein the shift of assignment is
made either unidirectionally or back-and-forth between

two parts deliverers.
An apparatus for scheduling parts deliverers,
each parts deliverer delivering a plurality of parts

received in shipment units at a parts reception place to
parts use positions, comprising:


a reception data file in which data of kind and
quantities of parts in each shipment unit and reception

instant thereof are stored in a correspondence relation
to one another;
a parts data file in which data of kind of parts and
parts use positions are stored in a correspondence

relation to one another;
a basic operation time data file in which a basic
operation time necessary for the calculation of each

delivering operation time is stored;
first calculating means for calculating the
delivering operation time required for delivering parts

included in each shipment unit based upon a number of
boxes of parts included in the shipment unit and a number

of the parts use positions therein to which the parts
included in the shipment unit are to be delivered

according to the data stored in said three data files; 
second calculating means for calculating the
delivering operation time for each parts deliverer by

accumulating delivering operation times calculated in
said first calculating means for shipment units to be

received between two parts deliverers;
uniformalizing means for shifting a shipment unit
between the two parts deliverers so as to make the

delivering operation times for part deliverer uniform;
third calculating means for calculating the
delivering operation time for each parts deliverer afresh

by accumulating delivering operation times calculated in
said first calculating means for shipment units assigned

to the parts deliverers after the shipment unit
assignment has been shifted in said uniformalizing means;

and
uniformness judging means for starting said
uniformalizing means and said third calculating means

repeatedly until a predetermined uniform level among
delivering operation times for parts deliverers as

calculated said third calculating means is realized.
The apparatus according to claim 3, further
comprising means for displaying, for each shipment unit,

the assignment relation thereof to a parts deliverer when
said uniformalizing means and said third calculating

means are no longer started repeatedly by said
uniformness judging means, the display being made by

indicating the parts deliverer with the shipment unit
assigned thereto.
The apparatus according to claim 3, further
comprising means for outputting the result of abridging

of the relation between parts and parts use positions for
the individual parts deliverers according to the finally

determined assignment of shipment units to parts 
deliverers, said reception data file and said parts data

file.
The method according to claim 1, further
comprising:


a step of providing a plurality of parts reception
places;
a step of designating one of the plurality of parts
reception places for each shipment unit, wherein the

shipment units assigned to one parts deliverer are
designated to have a same parts reception place;
a step of delivering all parts in each parts
reception place by each parts deliverer; and
a step of causing each parts deliverer to be
circulatorily in charge of the plurality of parts

reception places.
