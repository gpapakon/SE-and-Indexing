<ABSTRACT>
Laser surface ablation methods and apparatus are disclosed reprofiling surfaces astigmatically. An optical system (10) includes cylindrically-powered elements (18) to form an elliptical laser irradiation pattern (30) on a target surface. By successively altering the area of the elliptical irradiation, an astigmatic, bi-powered ablation profile is achieved. Preferably, the invention is used with an excimer laser for excimer laser keratoplasty, keratomileusis or other ablative eye surgeries.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods
and apparatus for eroding or ablating surfaces by
lasers. In particular, this invention relates to
methods and apparatus for eroding surfaces
astigmatically and for the correction of myopic
astigmatism through laser keratoplasty or
keratomileusis.Lasers can etch surfaces in a controlled
manner. These techniques are known and depend upon
the interaction between the surface structure and the
laser radiation which has a known wavelength and
energy density. In addition, the ablation of a
surface by laser radiation is typically time-rate
dependent, although this time dependency is usually
non-linear with ablative depth because of heat
build-up and other artifacts. Therefore, ablative
precision is often obtained through the use of pulsed
laser radiation. Short pulses provide controlled
depth etching in the application area. This control
is especially important in keratoplasty or in
keratomileusis procedures where the cornea of the eye
is ablated to correct certain visual deficiencies,
such as near-sightedness. By careful application of
laser radiation to the cornea, physicians are able to
surgically enhance a patient's vision with precision
and without tissue damage by overexposure. By successive application of laser pulses to
a surface and by altering the size of the area under
irradiation, curvatures can be created or altered on
a surface. For example, when the ablative technique
begins by irradiating a large, circular area and
progressively decreases the radius of the exposed
area, the central region has the greatest ablative
depth because it is irradiated the longest.
Conversely, the outer-most regions have the least
ablative depth. If the surface is initially flat,
the resulting profile would be concave. If the
surface is initially convex, the surface can be made
flat, or the curvature can be reduced depending upon
the degree of ablation. In keratoplasty or in
keratomileusis, the curvature on the cornea, i.e.,
the difference between the cornea's ideal curvature
and the patient's actual corneal shape, is modified.Surface erosion techniques to create or
remove astigmatic shapes has been less successful.
An astigmatic surface is by definition bi-powered:
there are two natural and orthogonal curvatures
creating the surface. A varying, circular
irradiation pattern can only create or remove a
single power on a surface. Existing methods to erode
astigmatic shapes have been complex and difficult to
implement. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,665,913
entitled "Method For
