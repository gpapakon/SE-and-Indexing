<ABSTRACT>
An attachment to a power screwdriver for positioning and 
feeding screws on a plastic tape. The tape advances one 

screw by reciprocal movement between a slide assembly (2) 
and a slide housing (1) by means of sprocket wheels (4). 

According to the present invention the slide assembly is 
provided with detachable nose piece (3) containing said 

sprocket wheels. The slide housing (1) has an arm extending 
therefrom into said slide assembly and nose piece 

when said nose piece (3) is coupled in place for operation. 
The arm has a sprocket advancing cross bar (6) at 

its distal end which follows a cam (7) advancing the 
sprocket wheels (4) one screw during the return stroke of 

the slide assembly (2) back out of the slide housing (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a screw positioning and feeding device, comprising
a slide assembly engaging a tape or belt holding a plurality of screws, for feeding,
by relative reciprocal movement between the slide assembly and a slide housing,
said screws one-by-one to a position to be driven in by a screwdriver bit in a power
screwdriver coupled to said device, said slide assembly comprising a pair of
sprocket wheels, for advancing said screw tape, said slide assembly having a detachable
nose piece containing said sprocket wheels, said slide housing having an
arm extending therefrom into the region of the nose piece when said nose piece is
coupled in place for operation, said arm having sprocket advancing means at its
distal end, which upon relative reciprocal movement between the slide assembly and
the slide housing acts to advance the sprocket wheels one screw tape step upon return
movement of the slide assembly.Devices of the above described type, in the form of a unit which can be mounted on
a power screwdriver or power drill with a screwdriver bit, have been available for
some fifteen years now, to make the job of setting up gypsum board or plywood
with screws go much more quickly and easily. Screws can be sold premounted in
plastic tape for easy handling. To position screws one-by-one for screwing, the tape
or belt is fed through the device, said tape being aligned to successively bring each
screw into position for screwing in. Specially designed perforations in the tape, surrounding
each screw shark, allow the tape to rupture and the screw head to pass
through the enlarged hole as the screw bit screws in the screw. In this type of feeder
attachment, sprocket wheels engage notches in the tape or belt and advance the
same one screw for every screw that is screwed in.One example of a previously known device of this type is described in DE 2 541
046 (Helfer). A ratchet wheel 17 cooperates with a sprocket wheel unit 9 to advance
a screw tape one screw for each forward movement of the slide housing (see Figs. 1
and 2 in said specification). The ratchet wheel is rotated by a pin 18 following a slot
19 in the slide housing 3. (See Fig. 3). This known device is prone to jamming in
the dusty environment in which it is used. Dismantling the device to clean the 
ratchet wheel, slot and sprocket wheels to remedy this is extremely complicated and
time consuming. The ratchet wheel/sprocket wheel coupling is particularly prone to
jamming due to dust collection. Also an accidental minimal displacement of

Screw positioning and feeding device, comprising a slide assembly (2) engaging a
tape or belt holding a plurality of screws, for feeding, by relative reciprocal movement

between the slide assembly (2) and a slide housing (1), said screws one-by-one
to a position to be driven in by a screwdriver bit (8) in a power screwdriver coupled

to said device, said slide assembly comprising a pair of sprocket wheels (4), for advancing
said screw tape, said slide assembly having a detachable nose piece (3)

containing said sprocket wheels, said slide housing having an arm extending therefrom
into the region of the nose piece (3) when said nose piece is coupled in place

for operation, said arm having sprocket advancing means (6) at its distal end, which
upon relative reciprocal movement between the slide assembly (2) and the slide

housing (1) acts to advance the sprocket wheels (4) one screw tape step upon return
movement of the slide assembly (2) 
chararacterized
 in that said arm extends
into said slide assembly, that said sprocket advancing means follows a cam

path to advance the sprocket wheels (4) one screw tape step upon return movement
of the slide assembly (2) back out of the slide housing (1), said nose piece being

detachable and replaceable, respectively, by displacement transversely to the slide
assembly in grooves, said nose piece having an opening to allow the sprocket advancing

means (6) of the distal end of the arm to pass out of and into the nose piece
as the nose piece is detached and replaced, respectively.
Screw positioning and feeding device according to Claim 1, 
characterized

in that said arm is articulated in two portions so that the sprocket advancing means

can follow the cam path, moving on its forward stroke out of engagement with the
sprockets of the sprocket wheels (4) and on its return stroke in engagement with said

sprockets.
Screw positioning and feeding device according to Claim 2, 
characterized

in that the portion of the articulated arm having the sprocket advancing means is 
spring biased to a central position extending straight from the other portion of the

arm.
Screw positioning and feeding device according to Claim 1, 
characterized

in that the proximal end of said arm is held by friction in a slot (12) in the slide
housing said friction being overcome upon continued relative movement of the slide

assembly into the slide housing after the sprocket advancing means has reached its
forwardmost position in its cam path, whereupon the proximal end of the arm moves

in said slot during said continued relative movement.
Screw positioning and feeding device according to Claim 4, 
characterized

in that different lengths of screws are accommodated by an extension adjustably
fixed to the nose piece.
