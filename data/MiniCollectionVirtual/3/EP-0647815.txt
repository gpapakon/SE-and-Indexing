<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to steam generators with a bank of curved tubes connected to a horizontal tube plate, the tubes which are closest together delimiting a central transverse region (60) known as the tube lane, which it is appropriate to obstruct at least in part by solid elements which limit the circulation of the secondary fluid around the tubes on the exterior of these. According to the invention, these elements are constituted by a stack (62) of blocks (66, 68, 70) accommodated in the central region, these blocks being removable and capable of being extracted or put in place in the enclosure of the generator through an access hole (92) made in its external wall (10).
