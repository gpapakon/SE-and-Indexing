<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sealed feedthrough device for a casing of an electrical equipment. This sealed feedthrough device (10) is intended to close off an opening (11) made in the wall (12) of a casing, especially of a junction box. It includes a flexible membrane (14), of annular shape, having a central opening (16) and a rigid cap (15) fitted over the top of this flexible membrane. The combination of these two elements, fastened together mechanically or physico-chemically, constitutes a closure plug (13) which is bonded (connected) to the wall (12). This sealed feedthrough allows connection of tubular pipes (conduits) or wires without recourse to a tool, especially a cutting tool.

<CLAIMS>
A tightly sealed bushing device with flexible membrane, notably for an enclosure of 
a piece of electrical equipment, allowing the tight passage of at least one connecting 

element, notably a duct or a cable, this device comprising a sealing plug inserted in a 
first opening (11) of conjugate shape arranged in at least one wall (12) of said 

enclosure,
 
characterized in that said sealing plug (13) comprises a flexible membrane (14) 

having at least a second central opening (16) of a diameter smaller than that of the 
first opening (11), and an annular peripheral (17) rim inside which a rigid cap (15) is 

inserted comprising a central swelling (18) arranged to be housed in the second 
central opening (16) of the flexible membrane (14), the sum of the thicknesses of the 

flexible membrane (14) and of the rigid cap (15) being appreciably equal to the 
thickness of the wall (12) of the enclosure. 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the assembly formed by the 
membrane (14) associated to the cap (15) is mounted on a clamping ring (20) 

constituting an intermediate part between the sealing plug (13) and the wall (12) of 
the enclosure, and that said clamping ring (20) comprises joining means (21) with the 

wall (12) of the enclosure. 
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that said joining means comprise 
a peripheral groove (22) arranged to receive a complementary protuberance 

securedly united to the wall of the enclosure, and a ramp (23) arranged to enable 
fitting by engagement of this ring in the opening (11) of the enclosure, the size of the 

ring being larger than the size of the elastomer wall. 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that said rigid cap (15) is made of 
a synthetic material having more or less adherence with respect to the flexible 

membrane (14). 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the transverse dimensions of 
the central swelling (18) of the rigid cap (15) are slightly larger than those of the 

second opening (16) of the flexible membrane (14), said cap being securedly united 
to said membrane by engagement of said swelling (18) in said second opening.  

 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the annular rim (17) of the 

membrane (14) presents a slightly inclined inside wall (19) which achieves gripping by 
friction of the rigid cap (15). 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the flexible membrane (14) is 
overcast over the first opening (11) of the enclosure. 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that an annular-shaped 
protuberant collar (40) is arranged facing the opening (11), on the external face of the 

enclosure (12) to increase the mechanical strength of the cap (15) in the sealing plug 
(13).
