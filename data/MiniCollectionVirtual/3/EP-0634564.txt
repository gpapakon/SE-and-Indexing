<ABSTRACT>
The abutment of a rocker lever (6) is formed by a longitudinally displaceable bearing pin (8), which can be locked by means of a locking bolt (13). With the bearing pin locked, the lift of the cam (7) is transmitted to the valve (1), with the bearing pin unlocked this is actuated instead of the valve. The bearing pin and the locking bolt are supported in a housing insert, which is in turn supported in the cylinder head (5) resting on a clearance adjusting element (11).

A device for deactivating a gate valve (1) of an internal combustion engine 
operated by a cam (7) via a rocking lever (6), the device comprising a 

bearing pin (8) constituting an abutment for the rocking lever (6) and 
disposed so as to be longitudinally movable relative to a spring element (18), 

and also comprising a locking pin (13) for locking the bearing pin (8),
 
characterised in that the bearing pin (8) and the locking pin (13) are 

disposed in a casing insert (10) which abuts a clearance-compensating 
element (11) in the cylinder head (5) of the internal combustion engine. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised by at least one of the following 
features: 


the locking pin (13) is movable substantially transversely relative to the 
bearing pin (8) and over its entire end face (19), 
the end face (19) of the bearing pin (8) is so inclined relative to the direction 
(15) of motion of the locking pin (13), which is situated in a side chamber 

(16) when the bearing pin is not locked, that the internal width (w) between 
the end face (19) and the opposite wall (20) of the casing insert increases 

from the longitudinal edge of the bearing pin remote from the side chamber 
(16) to the longitudinal edge facing the side chamber (16), 
a transverse pin (24) disposed in the casing insert (10) and extending in a 
longitudinal groove (25) through the bearing pin (8) prevents the bearing pin 

(8) from rotating around its longitudinal axis and 
the locking pin (13), which is cup-shaped, is held in the side chamber (16) 
by a tension spring (23) suspended in a pin (22) constituting a stop for the  

 
locking pin when at rest, and is movable relative to the tension spring (23) 

by hydraulic means during a locking operation.
