<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a resin composition made by blending a 
polycarbonate resin with an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin (hereinafter referred to 
as ABS), and is especially concerned with a low-gloss polycarbonate/ABS resin 
composition suitable for low-gloss products. Polycarbonate resins had high mechanical strength and have been known as 
highly functional resins, e.g., engineering plastics. These resins have also been known 
to be suitable for blending with various types of resins because of their properties. The following procedures, e.g., blending polycarbonates with an ABS resin 
(Japanese Kokoku Patent Nos. Sho 38[1963]-15225, Sho 51[1976]-11142); blending 
with polystyrene (Japanese Kokoku Patent Nos. Sho 43[1968]-6295, Sho 44[1969]-11551), 
have been known to improve the processability of an aromatic polycarbonate 
resin. Blending with either an ABS resin or polystyrene is suitable for improving the 
processability of a polycarbonate resin without damaging the mechanical strength.  However, the resulting products created by these blendings are glossy. Though 
glossy products are preferred for some applications, on the other hand, either mat or 
low-gloss products are desirable for the following applications, e.g., computer 
terminals (devices), OA devices, housings for various electric or electronic products, 
and various parts for cars. Embossing has sometimes been used to create products with low-gloss surfaces. 
However, the cost is high and the mat or low-gloss surface is damaged by abrasion. Also, there is an adverse influence on the physical properties such as impact 
strength when adding a mat agent such as fine-powder silica, silicate, alumina, or other 
mineral fillers. Attempts have been made to use a polymer as the added mat agent, 
resulting in an adverse influence on the following properties, e.g., impact strength, 
heat-distortion temperature, weather resistance, lightfastness, and other important 
properties. The following technique, i.e., blending an aromatic polycarbonate resin 
composition such as a glycidyl methacrylate copolymer that has low gloss and good 
mechanical properties, is the subject of a patent application (Japanese Kokai Patent  
 
Application Nos. Hei 2[1990]-227449, Hei 3[1991]-199255). However, products made 
of this resin composition exhibited high gloss, which was unsatisfactory for some 
applications. The purpose of this invention is to provide a polycarbonate/ABS resin 
composition which has high impact resistance, high weather
