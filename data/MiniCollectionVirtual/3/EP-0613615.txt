Haulm remover for potatoes or other tubers and roots,
able to be adapted to a pulling up, loading or cleaning

equipment comprising firstly a belt conveyor(1)taut between
two rollers with a transverse belt rotating anticlockwise

under one of said rollers(10), the entire unit overhanging
a device (4) for removing the crop ; and secondly a blower

(51) characterised in that the transverse roller (3) is
placed against the roller of the belt conveyor(1) and in

that the opening of the pipe (5) of the blower (51) is
located opposite the entire width of said belt conveyor(1)

and said transverse roller (3) so that the flow of air (50)
coming out from said pipe (5) flattens the haulms and waste

(20) of the crop (2) against said belt conveyor(1) and in
that said haulms and waste (20) are carried and pulled

between the latter and the roller (3).
