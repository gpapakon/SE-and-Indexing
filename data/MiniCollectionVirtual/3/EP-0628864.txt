<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method determining 
where to add hardener in a multilayer coating pack on a 

web fed through a coating station. The process 
includes determining the frequency and amplitude of the 

process noise associated with the coating station, 
determining the growth factor as a function of 

frequency on the incline surface and repeating these 
two steps for each of the layers in the coating pack. 

The plurality of growth factors obtained as a function 
of frequency is converted into a plurality of wave 

amplification versus frequency. After the plurality of 
wave amplitudes versus frequency is determined, one 

then selects from this plurality the one which is below 
a predetermined value in order to reduce coating cross 

streaks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
method of coating photographic materials onto a 
support. More specifically, the present invention 
provides a method for coating a support from a slide 
hopper wherein coating cross streaks and other 
imperfections are reduced. In the coating of photographic layers on a 
support such as film base or paper, a number of 
individual layers are coated onto the support 
simultaneously by means of a multiple slot coating 
hopper. This process may be performed many times, 
resulting in a multiplicity of multilayer coatings on 
the same base. It is often desirable to match the 
viscosity and density of each of the layers in the 
multiple layer pack; however, this is not always 
possible. When the viscosity or density of a layer 
becomes much different than a layer adjacent to it 
there is a risk of hopper slide wave nonuniformity. 
Hopper slide waves form because of disturbances to the 
coating process, such as machine vibrations or flow 
pulsations. When the viscosity or density of two 
layers becomes very different these waves can grow 
substantially resulting in nonuniformity in the final 
product and significant waste. In general, in photographic applications 
densities are very similar. An example of a situation 
which very often results in a layer viscosity mismatch 
in the coating of aqueous gelatin based photographic 
systems is the addition of a diffusible hardener in one  
 
of the layers of the last multilayer application. The 
hardener is designed to react with gelatin to form 
chemical crosslinks between gelatin molecules in all 
layers of the plurality of multilayer coatings. This 
process results in a hardened product with desirable 
mechanical characteristics for the photographic system. 
Since this hardener composition is, by design, very 
reactive with gelatin, the layer which is delivered 
with the hardener must typically be delivered and 
coated at a very low gelatin percentage with respect to 
the solvent, which is typically water, to reduce 
reactivity. This results in a layer of very low 
viscosity. It is desirable to coat all layers at as 
high a viscosity as possible to reduce the severity of 
nonuniformity due to such things as flow after coating 
resulting from nonplanar base and flow after coating 
resulting from air impingement on the coating. It is 
also desirable to reduce the time needed to chill set a 
coating so that the coating speed may be maximized. A 
polymer thickener may be added to increase this 
viscosity without increasing
