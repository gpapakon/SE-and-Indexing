<ABSTRACT>
A hook type coil winding machine which is disclosed wherein the occupation 
rate of a wire (50) which is threaded into a core hole (82) of a head (81) to effect 

winding of the wire is raised and the deviation of physical properties of cores 
produced thereon is reduced and besides the difficulty in winding at a last stage 

which is caused by the wire which gathers only at a portion of the core hole is 
eliminated. In the hook type coil winding machine, a wire is threaded through a 

small core hole (82) of a head core of a head for a hard disk drive or a video head 
and wound on the head core. The relative positions of the wire (50) and the head 

core (81) are controlled for each turn of the wire to achieve aligned winding of the 
wire to improve the occupation ratio of the wire in the core hole and assure correct 

winding of the wire by a predetermined number of turns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hook type coil winding machine, and more
particularly to a hook type coil winding machine wherein a wire is threaded into a
core hole formed in a core and wound on the core.A magnetic head, for example, of a video tape recorder or a hard disk drive
includes a coil which is formed by threading a wire formed from a thin wire
material into a core hole formed in a core of the head and winding the wire around
one of a pair of portions of the core which define the core hole therebetween
thereby to form a coil. The coil is used to read or write a signal by way of
electromagnetic induction or magnetic induction.Accordingly, in order to manufacture a magnetic head for a video tape
recorder or a hard disk drive, a wire must be threaded into a hole of a core and
wound on the core. To this end, a hook type coil winding machine is used. In the
hook type coil winding machine, a hook adapted to hook or catch a wire at an end
thereof is threaded into a core hole of a core and catches a wire, and then the hook
is pulled back to introduce the wire into and through the core hole, whereafter an
end portion of the wire is clamped and turned by a turning clamper to wind the
wire around the core to form a coil.With a conventional hook type coil winding machine of the construction
described above, however, a wire is wound but not in an aligned condition since
the machine does not have a function of controlling the position of a wire being
wound and the wire is wound in a natural or uncontrolled condition.
Consequently, the conventional hook type coil winding machine is
disadvantageous in the following points.In particular, the occupation rate of the wire in the core hole is so low that the
core hole is occupied fully before the wire is wound by a predetermined number of
turns, resulting in failure to wind the wire by the predetermined number of turns.
Further, the winding condition is not always uniform among different works,
resulting in deviation in characteristic of works, that is, cores of magnetic heads
after the winding step. Furthermore, a wire is liable to gather at a portion of the
core hole, which makes winding at a last stage of the winding operation difficult,
resulting in deterioration of the yield. FR-A-2 635 904 describes a hook type coil winding machine in which
cooperative movements of a chuck and a hook allow a wire to be wound on a core
so as to form a coil. This machine includes means enabling the chuck and the core
to be displaced in various different directions; these means are

<CLAIMS>
A hook type coil winding machine, comprising:

supporting means (49) for supporting thereon a core (81) which has a core hole (82)
formed therein such that a wire (50) to be wound on the core can be threaded through the

core hole and wound on the core to form a coil;
a chuck (17) operable to grasp and move the wire to a predetermined position; and
a hook (16) operable to move through the core hole (82)of the core supported on
said supporting means to catch the wire (50) at the predetermined position and then

move back through the core hole to thread the wire through the core hole;

   characterised in that there is further provided position adjustment means
(39,40,47,48) adapted to cause a relative displacement, in the axial direction of the coil,

between the core and the chuck upon the backward movement of said hook (16) or upon
the movement of said chuck (17), by moving at least one of the chuck and the supporting

means.
A hook type coil winding machine according to claim 1, wherein a wire layer
including a plurality of turns of the wire (50) is formed on another wire layer including a

plurality of turns of the wire, and the relative displacement effected by the position
adjustment means in a single winding operation for a turn is set greater upon formation

of an upper layer of the wire than upon formation of a lower layer of the wire.
A hook type coil winding machine according to claim 1, further comprising a

wire holder (55) located in an opposing relationship to an end portion of the wire in an
axial direction of a coil being formed when the wire is threaded through the core hole

and wound on the core.
