<ABSTRACT>
A two piece throttling valve is disclosed. The valve 
assembly includes a stationary outer housing (35) with an 

inner removable operable assembly (69). In this 
configuration the piping (pump stack) does not have to 

disassembled to remove, clean or replace the internal valve 
pieces or the in-line screen. The inner assembly (69) can 

be quickly removed for cleaning. The entire valve assembly 
(25) is heated to reduce deposition of volatile process 

byproducts on the internal valve surfaces and reduce the 
cleaning frequency. A wedge plate (63) is provided in the 

outer stationary valve housing (35) to mate with a sloped 
bottom surface (73) of the inner valve housing (70) such 

that when the inner assembly (69) is in position in the 
outer valve housing (35) there is a tight fit between 

adjacent sealing surfaces around the valve bore. A single 
flat surface seal provides vacuum sealing between the inner 

assembly (69) and outer housing (35). A dual valve stem 
(shaft) seal seals the valve shaft (79). The seal includes 

an inner O-ring made of a chemically resistant material and 

an outer O-ring that is less chemically resistant, but has 
a dual-quad profile to prevent vacuum leakage. A screen 

(57) in the fluid passage adjacent to and supported by the 
outer housing (35) can easily be accessed from the inside 

of the outer housing (35).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to throttling valves used in low 
pressure (vacuum) systems used to achieve and maintain process 
conditions for processing semiconductor wafers. In plasma metal etch processing, (a typical arrangement 
is shown in Figure 2), the process chamber 20 is connected by 
vacuum piping to a vacuum system including: a screen 57, a 
throttling valve assembly 24, a gate valve 26, a turbo 
(booster, turbo molecular) vacuum pump 28, and an isolation 
valve 30 connecting to main vacuum pumps (in the direction of 
the arrow 32). The throttling valve assembly 24 is generally 
a butterfly type throttling valve installed in the exhaust gas 
line between the process chamber 20 and the vacuum pumps. The 
throttling valve regulates the pressure in the etch process 
chamber 20. Gases used in the process chamber often produce 
etch byproducts, e.g., Al₂Cl₃, polymeric reaction products. 
These reaction products are drawn into the vacuum piping and 
rapidly condense on and coat the throttling valve tending to 
create particulates that have been found to contaminate the 
wafer in the process chamber. To maintain chamber particle contamination at acceptable 
levels the heavy polymer deposits on the throttling valve must 
be removed. Considerable time (several hours) must be spent  
 
removing and cleaning the throttling valve. The throttling 
valve is an integral part of the process chamber vacuum 
piping. To remove and clean the throttling valve, the piping 
adjacent the valve must be disturbed, if not completely 
disassembled, to permit the throttling valve to be removed. 
Each removal, cleaning, and reassembly cycle increases the 
possibility of damaging the piping or the valve and creating a 
vacuum leak. The deleterious effect of particulate contamination on 
the processing chamber and wafer(s) being processed due to 
polymer buildup is unacceptable. Repeated breach of the 
vacuum system to remove, clean and reinstall the throttling 
valve is a very burdensome and time consuming procedure when 
the piping (pumping stack or pumping system) has to be 
disturbed or disassembled for each cleaning. It reduces the 
process chamber throughput (increases production system 
downtime) and creates a higher risk of component damage. This invention provides a two piece throttling valve 
assembly which allows quick removal of the valve internals for 
cleaning and heats the entire valve assembly to reduce the 
polymer deposition rate and cleaning frequency. A stationary 
outer valve housing is permanently mounted in
