<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of our co-pending application 
Serial No. 095,746 filed July 21, 1993, which is incorporated 
herein by reference thereto. The present invention relates to light valves, and more 
particularly to improvements in making particles useful in a 
light valve suspension used to control light transmission in a 
light valve. U.S. Patents 4,877,313 and 5,002,701 describe light valves, 
particles useful in a light valve suspension and light valve 
suspensions, and are incorporated herein by reference thereto. In 
these patents, a light polarizing material containing adsorbed 
iodine, is described as being comprised of a complex obtained by 
reacting (i) elemental molecular iodine, (ii) a hydrohalide acid 
and/or an ammonium or alkali metal or alkaline earth metal 
halide, and (iii) a precursor compound, in the presence of a 
solution of a polymeric stabilizer in a non-aqueous solvent in 
which the precursor compound and the light-polarizing material 
are substantially insoluble. These particles are suspended in a 
liquid suspending medium to form a light valve suspension. It is particularly useful that the particle size of the 
particles suspended in the light valve suspension are not be too 
large (generally on the order of about 1 micron or less) in order 
to maintain the particles in a suspension without agglomeration  
 
or precipitation during repeated on-off cycles of the light 
valve. Obtaining particles of appropriate colloidal size, 
however, has been generally unpredictable and has been believed 
to be a function of the specific combination and character of the 
reaction materials used to form the particles and various 
crystallization conditions and parameters. Breaking up of large 
particles may affect the ability of the particles to function as 
light valve particles. It would therefore be desirable to 
initially form the particles in the appropriate size dimensions. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to 
provide crystals of a light polarizing material of a size 
suitable for use in a light valve suspension. It is a further object of the present invention to provide 
means for forming the suitable size of particles of light 
polarizing crystals as the particles of the light polarizing 
material are initially formed. These and other objects, features and advantages of the 
present invention will become more evident from the following 
discussion. The present invention provides a light polarizing material 
containing adsorbed iodine, comprising a complex
