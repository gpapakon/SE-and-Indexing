<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle door impact beam assembly comprises a beam 
(12), each end (12') of which has a convex curvilinear 

outer surface to form opposite curvilinear, outwardly 
facing connector surfaces, a steel plate (14, 14') at 

each end having at least one portion which is generally 
flat, and having a pair of opposite faces, a pair of 

elongated beads (20) upstanding from one of these faces 
of the steel plate, each bead having a convex curvilinear 

cross section, the beads being spaced from and parallel 
to each other, defining elongated, adjacent, mutually 

facing, curvilinear surfaces engaging the opposite 
curvilinear, outwardly facing surfaces of the tubular 

impact beam, and each curvilinear bead surface being 
welded to one of the curvilinear beam surfaces of one of 

the beam ends. The beads may be formed from the steel 
plate, each having a radius of curvature smaller than the 

radius of curvature of the ends of the beam. The 
mutually facing curvilinear bead surfaces are preferably 

spaced apart an amount less than the diameter of the beam 
end.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle door impact beam 
assembly or a beam and bracket combination, and also to 
a bracket or extension of an impact tubular door beam 
assembly. In meeting the requirements of the United States of 
America federal government, enacted in the Federal Motor 
Vehicle Safety Standard 214 (FMVSS 214), which mandate 
installation of door impact beams in vehicle side doors 
so as to have certain minimum impact resistance, a 
tubular beam having a steel composition such as that in 
US-A-4,210,467 is mounted between the inner and outer 
door panels. Employees of the present applicants have 
developed various tubular door beam configurations 
heretofore as set forth in US-A-4,636,608, US-A-4,708,390, 
UA-A-5,118,159, and US-A-5,123,694, such beams 
having their ends secured to brackets (commonly called 
extensions) which are in turn mounted to the door. To 
accommodate the convex tubular configuration, these 
brackets have a concave recess of the same configuration 
as the tube and the same diameter as, or slightly larger 
than, the diameter of the convexly curved door beam tube 
ends. The convex and concave size correlation must be 
close in order to assure an effective weld bond between 
the tube and bracket, and thereby assure proper impact 
protection to the vehicle passenger. These concave 
recesses are formed by a pair of stamping dies. Different vehicles employ different diameter door 
beam tubes, because of different door lengths, door 
configurations and/or other factors. Each different door 
beam tube diameter necessitates a different size recess 
in the mounting brackets and hence a different set of 
stamping dies. Dies of this type presently typically  
 
cost about US$50,000-US$60,000 or more per set. 
Therefore, a working inventory of dies amounts to a very 
substantial cost investment by the manufacturer. 
Assembly of the tubular beams to the conventional 
brackets also normally requires a programmed welding 
robot because of the different angles of the welding 
seam. The total capital investment is very large, 
therefore. The present invention aims to alleviate these 
problems of the prior art. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a vehicle door impact beam and bracket 
combination with the features set out in claim 1. According to a second aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a vehicle door tubular impact 
beam bracket with the features set out in claim 4. In a preferred construction a vehicle door impact 
beam

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle door impact beam and bracket combination 
(10) comprising an elongated tubular steel impact beam 

(12) having a pair of ends (12), each end having a convex 
curvilinear outer surface to form curvilinear, radially 

outwardly facing connector surfaces at opposite ends of 
the beam; a steel plate (14, 14') at each beam end having 

at least one portion which is generally flat, and having 
a pair of opposite faces; a pair of elongated beads (20) 

upstanding from one of the faces of the plate; the beads 
each having a convex curvilinear cross section; the beads 

being spaced from and parallel to each other, defining 
elongated, adjacent, mutually facing, curvilinear 

surfaces engaging the opposite curvilinear, outwardly 
facing surfaces of the tubular impact beam; each of the 

curvilinear bead surfaces being welded to one of the 
connector surfaces of one of the beam ends. 
A vehicle door impact beam and bracket combination 
as claimed in claim 1 wherein the beads (20) are formed 

from the steel plate, and each have a radius of 
curvature, the beam ends (12') also having a radius of 

curvature, the bead radius of curvature being smaller 
than the beam end radius of curvature. 
A vehicle door impact beam and bracket combination 
as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which the beam end 

has a diameter and the mutually facing curvilinear bead 
surfaces are spaced apart an amount less than the 

diameter of the beam end. 
A vehicle door, tubular impact beam bracket for 
interfitting with tubular impact door beams of a range of 

 
diameters and having a convexly curved peripheral 

surface, the bracket (14) comprising: a plate (16) having 
at least one portion which is generally flat, and having 

a pair of opposite faces; a pair of beads (20) upstanding 
from one of the faces of the plate; the beads each having 

a convex curvilinear cross section; the beads being 
spaced from and parallel to each other, defining 

elongated, adjacent, mutually facing, curvilinear 
surfaces for engaging with and bonding to the curved 

peripheral surface of a tubular impact beam (12). 
A bracket as claimed in claim 4 wherein the 
elongated beads are spaced from each other an amount 

resulting in the adjacent, opposing, curvilinear surfaces 
being spaced apart an amount less than the exterior 

diameter of the largest tubular door beam of the range of 
diameters, and a small amount less than the smallest 

tubular door beam of the range such that the engagement 
of a door (12) beam and the beads (20) is close to the 

neutral plane of the centerline (15) of the beam. 
A bracket as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 wherein 
the beads (20) are integrally formed from the plate and 

have a radius of curvature substantially smaller than the 
radius of curvature of a tubular beam in the range of 

diameters.

which the range of diameters comprises about 25 to about 

40 mm, preferably 25 to 36 mm.
