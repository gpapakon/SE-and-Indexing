<ABSTRACT>
An improved architecture for an array of flash 
EEPROM cells with paged erase is provided. The array is 

formed of a plurality of half-sectors. In each sector, 
the sources of the memory cell transistors are connected 

to a separate individual ground line. A ground line 
circuit is provided for generating a half-sector ground 

line signal. The separate individual ground line is 
connected to the ground line circuit for receiving the 

half-sector ground line signal which is at a predetermined 
positive potential during erase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to floating gate 
memory devices such as an array of flash electrically 
erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) cells 
with paged erase architecture. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to an improved architecture for 
an array of flash EEPROM cells with paged erase which 
includes multiple independent array ground circuits so as 
to provide greater endurance as well as enhanced 
performance. In U.S. Patent No. 5,077,691 to Sameer S. Haddad et 
al. issued on December 31, 1991, there is disclosed a 
flash EEPROM array which has a negative gate voltage 
erase operation. The '691 patent is assigned to the same 
assignee as in the present invention and is hereby 
incorporated by reference in its entirety. One of the 
advantages obtained by applying a negative erase voltage  
 
through the wordlines to the control gates rather than 
applying a positive erase voltage through the source 
common line to the source regions of all memory cells in 
the flash EEPROM simultaneously is that erasure can be 
made to occur selectively on a row-by-row basis rather 
than having to erase all the memory cells of a chip 
simultaneously. Preferably, groups of rows are formed 
such that each group defining a sector provides a page-selectable 
erase block. For example, the memory array 
consisting of a large number, N x M (i.e., 1,000 or more) 
of such memory cells are typically formed on a single 
integrated circuit chip in an N x M matrix form, where N 
equals the number of columns and M equals the number of 
rows. If the matrix is assumed to have 1 million cells 
(i.e., 1024 x 1024), then groups of 128 rows each could 
be formed together so as to divide the matrix into eight 
sectors. Further, each of the sectors may be divided 
into two segments (left sector and right sector). Thus, 
the memory array could be typically formed of 16 half-sectors. 
Hence, the memory array could be erased 
selectively half-sector by half-sector for any given 
number of half-sectors rather than all memory cells being 
erased simultaneously. In U.S. Patent No. 5,126,808 to Antonio J. Montalvo 
et al. issued on June 30, 1992, there is disclosed a 
flash EEPROM array with paged erase architecture. This 
'808 patent is assigned to the same assignee as in the 
present invention and is also hereby incorporated by 
reference in its entirety. With this paged erase architecture, 
during an erasure of a page a relatively high 
negative potential of -12 volts was applied to all of the 
control gates
