<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a tremolo (100) for a stringed instrument including at least a tremolo spring (105) which on the one side is fixed to a fulcrum block (116) and on the other side to a baseblock (103) pivoting about fulcrums, to which baseblock the strings (108) of the stringed instrument may be anchored, wherein the fulcrums consist of two knife edge bearings, each knife edge bearing consisting of a groove-shaped means (130, 131) cooperating with a pointed means (106, 107), which two knife edge bearings together determine a pivoting axis (x), the pointed means (106, 107) and the groove-shaped means (130, 131) being fixed in such a way, that the mean distance between the strings and the pivoting axis (x), and the angle of the pivoting axis (x) relative to the rough plane determined by the strings, can be adjusted.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the following, the term "tremolo" is used to designate a device for achieving pitch change in a stringed instrument. Such devices are well known in the field of electronic guitars where the terms "tremolo" and "vibrato" are both used to define the same arrangement.The invention relates to a tremolo apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1.
Such a tremolo apparatus is known from US-A-4,742,750.A tremolo having an angled pivoting axis is known from
US-A-4,632,005. This known tremolo consists of a bridge to which
several roller-equipped saddles are mounted, which bridge is firmly
mounted to the body of the stringed instrument, and a tailpiece
pivotable about a fixed angled pivoting axis, to which tailpiece
the strings are anchored.The string tension of the plurality of strings is in balance
about the pivoting axis with a tremolo spring, whereas the tremolo
is activated by exercising a pulling or pushing force on a lever
(hereinafter referred to as: tremolo-arm). So, the tailpiece pivots
and a corresponding increment or decrement of the tension and the
pitch of each string is achieved, the strings moving on rollers in
the saddles. The movement of strings on the rollers can cause friction,
particularly when wear and corrosion occur in the bearing of
these rollers. Moreover, the bearing of the pivoting axis in the
known tremolo comprises an axis and a hole. It is known that such a
bearing has much more friction than for instance a knife edge bearing.
Furthermore, the known apparatus is equipped with a compression
type coil spring as tremolo spring, which about an arm counterbalances
the string tension. This construction is not statically
determined, so that undesired deformation and friction can occur.The occurrence of friction in the tremolo movement is a problem,
because the tremolo will not always return to the same neutral
position, causing the stringed instrument to sound out of tune.In addition, the angle of the pivoting axis is determined, so
that it is hardly possible to set the amount of pushing or pulling
force on the tremolo arm relative to the tremolo effect (hereafter
referred to as: tremolo action) precise and within an adequate
range. Particularly, when using a heavier string gauge the action
of the known tremolo cannot be set deep enough. The known tremolo further is supplied with the feature that
the distance between the anchoring point of each string and the
pivoting axis can be adjusted in order to facilitate a very precise
compensation of the different stretch characteristics of
