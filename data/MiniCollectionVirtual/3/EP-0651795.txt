<ABSTRACT>
A method for isolating a mutant cell that secretes a desired compound at a level greater than the starting cell from which the mutant cell is derived. The method includes providing a starting cell and a feeder cell. The starting cell has at least three characteristics. First, the starting cell has a requirement for a metabolite for survival or division of the starting cell in a solid growth medium. Second, the starting cell mutates to lack that requirement at a frequency of less than 10
<
-10
>
 per cell division. Third, the starting cell has a rate of mutation of at least 10
<
-6
>
 per nucleotide base per cell division. The feeder cell has at least two properties. First, the feeder cell requires the desired compound for survival or division of the feeder cell in a growth medium. Second, the feeder cell secretes the metabolite required by the starting cell into the solid growth medium. The method further includes contacting a plurality of the feeder cells and the starting cells together in a solid growth medium to allow the feeder cells to produce the desired compound and the starter cells to produce the metabolite. Both the cells will grow and divide to produce a plurality of colonies. Those colonies which are largest include one or more mutant cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR ISOLATING MUTANT CELLS Background of the invention This invention relates to methods for isolation of a mutant cell containing one or more mutations which enhance production of a desired compound from the cell compared to a cell without such mutations.It is common to isolate mutant cells which overproduce a specific metabolite by selecting cells which are resistant to analogs of the metabolite. For example, Yamada et al. describe isolation of mutants which overproduce biotin by selection for cells resistant to a biotin analog. 47 Agricultural Biological Chemistry. 1011, 1983. Other examples include methionine overproducing mutants (Yamada et al.. AgriculturalBiological Chemistry 46:47, 1982; isolated by selecting cells resistant to ethionine) ; valine overproducing mutants (Hibberd 62, Iowa State Journal of Research. 479, 1988; selecting valine resistance); pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic enzyme overproducers (Kempe et al., 9 Cell 541, 1976; selecting resistance to N-phosphonacetyl-1- aspartate) ; and amino acid overproducers in Cvanobacteria (Hall et al., 143 Journal Bacteriology. 981, 1980; selecting antimetabolite analog resistance) . In Hall et al., id., wild type Bacillus subtilis cells were used as a test lawn for screening obvious regulatory mutants from among collections of analog resistant strains. Auxotrophic strains of B. subtilis were convenient indicator strains for identification of mutants in Cvanobacteria through observation of syntrophic growth responses.Green, Second Chemical Congress of the North American Continent, San Francisco, August 22, 1980, Abstract No. 16 describes production of mutant Corn cells 

resistant to lysine- and threonine-induced growth inhibition.Grull et al. 137 Journal of Bacteriology. 480, 1979, describe isolation of a ino acid overproducing mutants of E. coli by mutagenesis and penicillin enrichment.Vincenzotto and Matagne, 90 Archive Internationales de Chemi, B88, 1982, describe isolation of mutants of an alga by mutagenesis and screening on agar medium containing various dyes.Santhaguru and Avissar, 21 Israel Journal of Medical Sciences. 185, 1985, describe use of levulinate, a competitive inhibitor of the heme biosynthetic pathway, for isolation of heme overproducing Rhizobium mutants. Summary of the InventionThis invention concerns a method for symbiotic amplification of desired mutant cells by using two genetically different populations of cells which can cross-feed each other. The mutant cells are produced from starter cells grown on solid
