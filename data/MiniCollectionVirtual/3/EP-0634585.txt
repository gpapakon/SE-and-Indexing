<ABSTRACT>
The brake drum has a cylindrical inner brake surface (16) for the brake linings (22), and a ring-like end face (18) at the open end of the drum. This end face adjoins the brake face at right angles and is surface-structured on a section adjoining the brake face and extending over the area of the maximum wear state. The surface structure section can be made of roughened material or have adjoining grooves and studs. It can be a ring groove (18) with an ring like intermediate area between the inner edge (18a) of the end face and the groove.

<CLAIMS>
A brake drum (10) having a cylindrical inner braking 
surface (16) for corresponding brake linings (22), and an 

annular end face (18) formed at the open end of the break 
drum (10), which is structured on its surface, at least 

at the portion (18b, c, d) thereof adjoining the braking 
surface (16). 
The brake drum according to claim 1, wherein the portion 
(18b, c, d) being structured on its surface runs 

annularly around the opening (14). 
The brake drum according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the 
portion (18b) being structured on its surface consists of 

a roughening of the material. 
The brake drum according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the 
portion being structured on its surface consists of beads 

and neps being disposed side by side. 
The brake drum according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the 
portion (18b) being structured on its surface consists of 

webs being disposed side by side in spaced apart 
relationship (ribbing 18c). 
The brake drum according to claim 5, wherein the 
structuring (18b) of the surface consists of a ribbing 

(18c) running radially. 
The brake drum according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the 
portion being structured on its surface consists of an 

annular groove (18d) adjoining directly the breaking 
surface (16).  

 
The brake drum according to claim 7, wherein an annular 
intermediate zone (18b) is disposed between the inner 

edge (18a) of the end face (18) and the groove (18d). 
The brake drum according to claim 8, wherein the inner 
portion (18b) has a surface structure according to anyone 

of claims 3 through 6. 
The brake drum according to anyone of claims 7 through 9, 
wherein the ring groove (18d) has - in section - the 

profile of a circular arc portion. 
The brake drum according to anyone of claims 7 through 9, 
wherein the ring groove (18e) has - in section - an V-profile 

opening into the end face. 
The brake drum according to anyone of claims 1 through 
11, wherein the width of the annular portion (18b) and/or 

a section of the annular groove (18d) corresponds to the 
condition of maximum wear. 
The brake drum according to anyone of claims 1 through 
11, wherein the width of the annular portion (18b) 

corresponds to a first condition of wear of the brake 
drum (10), and the width of the annular portion (18d) 

together with the width of the annular portion (18b) 
correspond to the condition of maximum wear of the brake 

drum (10). 
The brake drum according to anyone of claims 7 through 
13, wherein the ring groove (18d) is replaced by a ring 

surface of different surface structure, opposite of the 
inner portion (18b) and possibly an outer portion (18e) 

of the end face (18).
