<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a transport 
system as defined in the preamble to Claim 1. In prior art, transport systems are known for 
moving various kinds of loads. Such systems usually 
comprise an elongated rail section which is carried on 
a stationary structure, e.g. on a wall, ceiling or 
equivalent structure of a building. The system further 
comprises a travelling crab provided with traversing 
wheels and to which the load that has to be transported 
is connected, and said travelling crab can be moved 
with the aid of the traversing wheels in support of 
said rail section and longitudinally thereto. A particular application in which systems of 
this kind are employed is in association with real 
estate servicing operations, in which the transport 
system is used to suspend movable service platforms, 
hanging carriages, hanging ladders etc. appliances. 
Using these appliances, in turn, the indoor and outdoor 
façades, inside and outside surfaces of ceilings/roofs 
can be maintained and serviced, e.g. glass roof surfaces 
can be cleaned, façade elements can be installed, 
broken window panes can be replaced, etc. The rail section 
in support of which the travelling crab moves together 
with the appliance thereto attached may be 
mounted to run the circuit of the entire façade of the 
building in that it is bent at corners to conform to 
the configurations of the building. The rail may equally 
deviate from the horizontal at an upward or downward 
inclination, and the travelling crab provided with 
drive and brake means may run along the rail and negotiate 
uphill and downhill stretches formed in this way. Nowadays also premises roofed over with extensive 
glass roofs have become increasingly common, e.g. 
shopping centres and enclosed courtyards; these require 
apparatus for minding the vertical indoor façades as  
 
well as the roof glassing. The vertical façades can be 
serviced using hanging scaffolds or hanging ladders. 
The horizontal or inclined glass roofs can be serviced 
from a service platform installed in bridge fashion on 
two rails fixed to the supporting structures. The problem in systems of prior art is that 
the rail sections are designed for one type of use 
only, whereby a travelling crab of one single type can 
be installed to run along a given rail section, that 
is, either a travelling crab suspended from the rail 
section or one running thereupon. It follows that the 
rail sections of transport systems known in the art are 
greatly lacking in versatility of possible
