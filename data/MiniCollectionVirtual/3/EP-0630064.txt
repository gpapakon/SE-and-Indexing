<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithium ion type
nonaqueous electrolyte-secondary battery which is improved in
the discharge quality and the cycle properties or the charge-discharge
cycle life.There have actively been investigated nonaqueous
electrolyte-secondary batteries which make use of, as negative
electrode-active materials, lithium-containing light metal
alloys or substances capable of absorbing and releasing lithium
ions because of their high electric voltages and high energy
densities. On the other hand, there have generally been used
lamellar compounds which make use of intercalation of Li such
as LiMn2O4, Li2MnO3, LiCoO2, LiCo0.5Ni0.5O2, LiNiO2 and MoS2 as
positive electrode-active materials for secondary batteries. In
particular, LiCoO2 as disclosed in Japanese Un-examined Patent
Publication (hereunder referred to as "J.P. KOKAI") No. Sho 55-136131
is useful because it can provide a battery having a high
discharge voltage of not less than 3.5 V and a high capacity.
However, the crystalline structure thereof is gradually destroyed
as the battery is repeatedly charged and discharged, the
destruction of the crystalline structure becomes conspicuous if 
the degree of discharge is increased for the absorption of Li
and the deterioration of the quality thereof proceeds. In
respect of the charge-discharge cycle properties, however, it
requires an improvement in stability of voltage and capacity
like most of other materials for positive electrodes. Under such
circumstances, there have been proposed in, for instance,
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (hereunder referred to
as "J.P. KOKAI") Nos. Hei 4-61760, Hei 4-162357, Hei 3-201368
and Hei 4-267053, methods for improving the charge-discharge
characteristics and cycle properties of these secondary
batteries which utilize compound oxides obtained by further
adding polyvalent transition metals to the foregoing active
materials. These methods permit improvement in the cycle
properties such as stabilization of voltages, but they cannot
simultaneously improve battery quality such as capacity and
discharge voltage. Moreover, the use of many polyvalent metals,
in place of metals such as Co, Mn and Ni, has variously been
proposed, but there has not yet been investigated any effect
accomplished by the simultaneous use of polyvalent metals and
monovalent alkali metals usable in place of Li.EP-A-0 484 187 describes a positive active material for a non-aqueous
electrolyte secondary battery, the said material being
composed of a layer-like structure
