<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a novel culture which belongs to Actinoplanes (Actinoplanes sp. FERM BP-3832). This culture is capable of producing rapamycin more than ten times efficiently than the cultures which have been reported (e.g., Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC 29253). The present invention provides a process for the production of rapamycin which comprises cultivating Actinoplanes sp. FERM BP-3832 and thereafter isolating rapamycin from the fermentation mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new culture capable of producing rapamycin. 
Rapamycin of the present invention is produced by fermentation of a new 
microorganism designated as Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 (FERM BP-3832) in a 
nutritious medium. Rapamycin (United States Patent No. 3929992 and No. 3993749) was reported 
as an antifungal antibiotic which was produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus AY B-994 
(ATCC 29253) (C. Vezina, A. Kudelski and S. N. Sehgal, J. Antibiotics 28, 721-726, 
1975). In recent years, it has been demonstrated that rapamycin shows potent 
immunosuppressive activity. Hitherto, it is known that S. hygroscopicus ATCC 29253 
is used for the production of rapamycin, which was reported together with 
physicochemical properties (United States Patent No. 3929992). An object of the 
present invention is to provide a new culture which belongs to the different genus from 
Streptomyces. In addition, an object of the present invention is to provide a culture 
capable of producing rapamycin more efficiently than the cultures which have been 
reported in the prior art. The present invention is directed to a new culture capable of producing 
rapamycin. Rapamycin is produced by fermentation of Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 
(FERM BP-3832). The present invention also is directed to a culture capable of producing 
rapamycin more efficiently than Streptomyces hygroscopicus which has been reported 
in the prior art. Furthermore, the present invention is directed to a biologically-pure culture 
having the characteristics of Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 (FERM BP-3832), as well as 
mutants and transformants of any of the foregoing, capable of producing rapamycin, 
including any such culture in freeze-dried form. Such a culture is capable of producing 
rapamycin in a recoverable quantity upon fermentation in an aqueous nutrient medium 
comprising assimilable sources of carbon and nitrogen.  
 A culture N902-109 was isolated from a soil sample collected in Shizuoka 
Prefecture, Japan. The culture has narrow hyphae of the Actinomycetales and motile 
spores produced in sporangia-like clusters on the substrate mycelium - a feature 
characteristic of members of the genus Actinoplanes. The generic identity was further 
supported by the results of whole-cell analysis. The taxonomical properties of N902-109 are as follows. The culture N902-109 
was planted from a slant into ATCC #172 broth and grown for 4 days at 28Â°C on a 
shaker. It was then centrifuged for 20 minutes, washed 3 times with sterile water and 
planted on
