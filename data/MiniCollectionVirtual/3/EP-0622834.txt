<ABSTRACT>
SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology has been touted as a
promising approach for fabricating an advanced integrated

circuits because of its advantage over bulk silicon circuits
such as faster speed and improve radiation tolerance. One

drawback to SOI is that parasitic bipolar induced
latch-up/breakdown voltage levels severely limits the maximum

supply voltage at which SOI circuits and devices can operate.
When the parasitic device turns on, the SOI transistor cannot

be switched off by changing the gate bias. What is described
is a method whereby the operating voltage in which this effect

occurs is significantly increased thus allowing circuit
operation at reasonable power supply voltages. The method is

to implant a neutral impurity ion such as krypton, xenon or
germanium into the device (10) to form ion scattering centers.

The size of the impurity atom must be much larger than the
size of the silicon atom. The size difference generating a

scattering center.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor device processing, and 
more particularly, to latch-up prevention and increased 
breakdown voltage in SOI devices. Circuits and devices built in SOI substrates have been shown 
to have many advantages over identical circuits built in bulk 
silicon substrates. SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology has 
been touted as a promising approach for fabricating advanced 
integrated circuits because of its faster speed and improved 
radiation tolerance. However, one of the disadvantages of SOI 
devices is the parasitic bipolar induced latch-up/breakdown 
voltage, which severely limits the maximum power supply 
voltage at which SOI circuits and devices can operate. When 
the parasitic device turns on, the SOI device cannot be 
switched off by changing its gate bias. This single 
transistor latch-up also manifests itself as a very low 
breakdown voltage. The SOI device self latch-up effect is 
caused by a positive feedback mechanism generated by the 
steady-state balancing between the minority and majority 
carriers in the body of the transistor. For a given gate 
voltage, as the drain voltage is increased, the electric field 
at the body/drain junction becomes high enough so that 
electron/hole pairs are generated by impact ionization. The 
majority carriers (carriers of the same dopant type as the 
source and drain) are collected at the drain while minority 
carriers travel into the body of the transistor. In SOI 
devices, the body of the transistor is separated from the 
substrate by a buried oxide. The minority carriers thus 
collect in the body of the transistor. At sufficiently high  
 
drain bias, the concentration of minority carriers in the body 
disturbs the normal steady state potential of the body. To 
compensate, majority carriers are injected from the source. 
These carriers then diffuse to the high field region of the 
drain/body junction, creating even more electron/hole pairs by 
impact ionization, and cause a run-away current in the device. Several approaches have been discussed in the known art for 
increasing the voltage at the drain for onset of the device 
self latch-up/breakdown effect. The known approaches are 
based on reducing the drain electric field for a given drain 
bias (LDD approaches) or adding an extra contact to the body 
of the transistor to keep it at a constant potential and to 
act as a sink for the excess carriers (body tie approaches). In the body tie approach, either an extra contact is attached 
to the body of the transistor to keep
