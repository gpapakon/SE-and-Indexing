<ABSTRACT>
A set of panels (26, 28, 30, 32) and hinges are used to form a polygonal linkage, which in turn forms a reservoir (22). The reservoir (22) coupled to a movable door panel (30). The amount of air in the reservoir controls the position of the door panel (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to air flow control structures 
used for heating and cooling systems, and more 
particularly to a pressure operated door for use in 
controlling ventilation air flow in an automobile. Modern automobiles have complex ventilation systems 
which include air-cooling and air-heating units. 
Typically, rigid doors are provided within the duct work 
to control and direct the passage of air. Usually, the 
doors are mounted on a door axle which is rotated by a 
vacuum actuator located on the exterior surface of the 
duct work. More recently, it has been proposed to 
integrate a bellows type actuator with the door 
structure. Such a device is known from United Kingdom Patent 
Application GB-A-2 010 470. According to the invention, several rigid panels 
are linked together with hinges to form a 
polygonal linkage. The panels along with a first side 
wall and a second side wall define a closed 
reservoir. The volume within this reservoir is 
variable and depends upon the various angles between the 
various panels which make up the reservoir. A vacuum 
drawn in the reservoir causes ambient air pressure to 
collapse the reservoir by reducing the interior volume 
of the reservoir. Reduction of the volume of the reservoir is 
accompanied by movement of the panels. One of the 
panels may form a portion of a door 
assembly. Consequently the application of vacuum to 
the reservoir causes the door assembly to move 
from a first position to a second position. The panels and hinges are illustratively arranged to  
 
produce an asymmetrical trapezoidal shape for the 
polygonal linkage. This asymmetry causes the linkage to 
move in a preferred direction as the reservoir volume is 
reduced. The integration of the linkage into the door 
structure provides a compact space efficient assembly 
which has a long service life and which may be readily 
designed into an automotive ventilation system. An illustrative and exemplary embodiment of the 
invention is shown in the various figures. Identical 
reference numerals refer to identical structure 
throughout. FIG.1 is a perspective view of the door assembly. FIG.2 is a cross-section of the door assembly. FIG.3 is a perspective view of the door assembly. FIG.4 is a cross-section of the door assembly. FIG.5 is a front view of the door assembly in

<CLAIMS>
A door assembly for controlling airflow through a duct 
(14) of the type having a movable door panel and a supply 

of air, wherein the improvement comprises: 

a door panel (48); 
a mounting panel (50) coupled to said door panel (48) 
by a hinge (56); 
a base panel (54) coupled to said mounting panel (50) 
by a hinge (56); 
an actuator panel (58) coupled to said base panel (54) 
by a hinge (56), and coupled to said door panel (48) by a 

hinge (60); 
 
   whereby said panels and hinges collectively form a 

polygonal linkage for moving said door panel (48) in an 
arcuate path (68);
 
   whereby said panels and hinges together form a portion 

of a reservoir (22);
 
   said reservoir having an interior volume (20) which 

increases in response to door motion in a first direction 
and which decreases in response to door motion in a second 

direction;
 
   pressure control means (17) for controlling air flow 

into and out of said reservoir to control the position of 
said door panel. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said pressure control 
means comprises: 


a first air passage (62) communicating with said 
reservoir (22); 
a second air passage (70) communicating with said 
reservoir (22); 
a valve spring (66) connected to said base panel (54); 
 
   whereby said valve spring (66) may prevent said second 

air passage from communicating with said reservoir at a 
predetermined door panel position.  

 
The apparatus of claim 2 wherein said pressure control 
means comprises: 


a tube (82) coupled to said door panel, communicating 
with said reservoir (22); 
a rotary piston (80) coupled to said tube and having 
a port 84 which communicates with said reservoir (22); 
an annular control ring (78) mounted concentric with 
said rotary piston (80) and having a slot (94) in 

communication with a source of pressurized fluid, whereby 
said position of said slot with respect to said port 

determines the position of said door panel.
