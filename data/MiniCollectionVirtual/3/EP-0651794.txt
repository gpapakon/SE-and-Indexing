<ABSTRACT>
In the mutant  alpha -amylase one or more of the methionine amino acid residues is exchanged with any amino acid residue except for Cys and Met. The thus produced mutant  alpha -amylase exhibits an improved stability in the presence of oxidizing agents and an improved thermoactivity at moderate low pH values. The mutant  alpha -a amylase is well suited as an additive to detergents, dish washing agents and liquefaction agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MUTANT α-AMYLASE, DETERGENT, DISH WASHING AGENT, AND LIQUEFACTION AGENTThe invention comprises a mutant α-amylase, a detergent, a dish washing agent, and a liquefaction agent. Mutant amylases with improved oxidation stability, wherein one or more methionines have been mutated into cysteins or chemically modified cysteins are described in WO 91/16423. The reason for research in this field is the need for oxidation stable α-amylases as additives for detergents and dish washing agents, due to the presence of strong oxidizing agents in the detergents and the dish washing agents, as explained in more detail in WO 91/16423.It has been found that the activity level and the stability in the presence of oxidizing agents of the prior art mutant amylases is open to improvement, and thus, the purpose of the invention is the provision of a mutant α-amylase with an improved activity level and an improved stability in the presence of oxidizing agents in comparison to the prior art mutant amylases. In this context the term "stability in the presence of oxidizing agents" refers both to the storage stability of the α-amylase during storage of the α-amylase product and during storage of the α-amylase containing detergent or the α-amylase containing dish washing agent, and to the stability in the washing solution or dish washing solution during the washing process or dish washing process, and furthermore to the stability of the α-amylase during hydrolysis of starch in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or other bleaching agents, e.g. during desizing in the textile industry.The mutant α-amylase according to the invention is characterized by the fact that one or more of the methionine amino acid residues is exhanged with any amino acid residue except for Cys and Met. Thus, according to the invention the amino acid residues to replace the methionine amino acid residue are the following: Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Gin, Glu, Gly, His, He, Leu, Lys, Phe, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val.Surprisingly it has been found that the mutant α-amylase according to the invention exhibits a better activity level and a better stability in the presence of oxidizing agents than the prior art mutant amylases. 

 A preferred embodiment of the mutant α-amylase according to the invention is characterized by the fact that the α-amylase is a Bacillus α-amylase.Bacillus α-amylase exhibit in themselves a high heat stability, and by being mutated according to the invention the mutants exhibit an even better stability, especially in the presence of oxidizing
