<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of producing a biologically 
active polypeptide by culturing animal cells capable of producing the 

polypeptide, adapted to agitation culture in suspension in serum-free 
medium, and Chinese hamster ovarian cells, capable of proliferation in 

suspension in serum-free medium, which produce a polypeptide belonging to 
the human nerve growth factor family and is useful for industrial mass 

production of a biologically active polypeptide in high purity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of efficiently producing a 
eukaryotic biologically active polypeptide by culturing recombinant animal 
cells in suspension in serum-free medium, and cells capable of producing the 
biologically active polypeptide by the culture of the present invention. The mass-culture of recombinant animal cells is very important for the 
production of biologically active polypeptides such as interferons, 
erythropoietin, tissue plasminogen activator, granulocyte colony stimulating 
factors and nerve growth factors. For example, the nerve growth factor (hereinafter sometimes 
abbreviated to as NGF) family is known to play a key role in the survival of 
cholinergic neurons in the procephalic basal field in the central nervous 
system, as well as being essential for the survival of sensory or sympathetic 
nerve ganglion cells in the peripheral nervous system. Since NGF acts to 
enhance neuron survivability as stated above; since intracerebral 
administration of NGF improved memory disorder in aged rats [W. Fischer et 
al., Nature, Vol. 329, p. 65 (1887)]; and since research has advanced drug 
delivery systems for intracerebral transportation of intravenously 
administered NGF [P.M. Friden et al., Science, Vol. 259, p. 373 (1993)], there 
is a need for industrial production of NGF with the expectation that it is 
applicable to pharmaceuticals for senile dementia. For producing biologically active polypeptides by animal cell, both 
suspensive and adherent types of cells can be used for host cells: suspensive 
cells such as human Burkitt's lymphoma (Namalwa) cells and mouse 
myeloma (Sp2/0) cells, and adhesive cells such as Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, human uterocervical 
epitheloid carcinoma (HeLa) cells, mouse mammary tumor (C127) cells and 
mouse fibroblast (NIH/3T3) cells. CHO cells, in particular, are commonly 
used [C. Bebbington and C. Hentschel, Trends in Biotechnology, Vol. 3, p. 314 
(1985); D. Broad et al., Cytotechnology, Vol. 5, p.47 (1991)]. Suspensive cells usually permit agitation culture in suspension, while 
adhesive cells, not easy to culture in suspension, are usually cultured by  
 
roller bottle culture, microcarrier culture or culture in which cells are 
immobilized on an immobilizing bed. For industrial mass production of 
valuable substances, however, suspension culture is advantageous over 
immobilized culture from the viewpoint of operation and scale-up feasibility. 
Recently it was reported that the erythroblast
