<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
and a device for detecting the angular position of a
permanent magnet inductor relative to an armature
of the kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1
and Claim 9, respectively.The invention is applicable to devices
which detect the angular position of the rotor of
electric brushless motors.Brushless motors are synchronous
machines. Information concerning the position of
the rotor is necessary for correct operation and
control-of motors of this type. Typically, Hall-effect
sensors are used to detect the angular
positions of the rotor in which the current is to
be switched in the phases or windings of the
motor.Alternatively, in the absence of position
sensors, the angular position of the rotor can be
determined by detecting and analysing the
electromotive forces induced in the phases
of the motor. This enables the correct switching
points or moments of the current in the phases to
be determined. In this way, according to the prior art,
switching can be achieved without position
sensors. However, in the control systems
according to the prior art, the information
concerning the angular position of the rotor, in
motors of the type without sensors, is imprecise
such that the switching moments are not determined
in an optimum manner. This constitutes a
technical problem since the control and
performance of the motor is impaired.Furthermore, according to the known
processes, switching is brought about at fixed
angles of the rotor independently of the speed of
the rotor and the moment when the current is
prohibited in one phase corresponds to the
beginning of the conduction of current in another
phase.These aspects of the control of brushless
motors are still not optimum. In fact, brushless
motors controlled in this way have the following
technical disadvantages.In the motor a current waveform is
generated which causes a variation of the output
torque. Brushless motors also produce
electromagnetic interference. US-A-5 130 620 discloses a method and a device of the
above-mentioned kind for detecting the angular position of
the rotor of a brushless motor. According to this prior
art the zero-crossing points of the counter electromotive
forces induced in the stator windings are converted into a
pulse train. The period of that pulse train is digitally
measured by means of a first counter and a signal
indicative of the rotor position is generated in response
to the thus measured period. Thus, the content of the first counter,
which constitutes a control signal indicating
