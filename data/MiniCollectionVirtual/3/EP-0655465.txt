<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing volatile residues from polyacrylate melts by evaporating off the volatile components under reduced pressure, adding entraining agents to the melts at temperatures above 100 DEG C and simultaneously circulating the melts by pumping.

<CLAIMS>
A process for eliminating volatile residues from polyacrylate 
melts by evaporating off the volatile components, wherein the 

volatile constituents are evaporated off under reduced pressure, 
entraining agents are added to the melts at above 100°C 

toward the end of the distillation and the melts are simultaneously 
circulated, the entraining agent being fed directly 

into the circulation. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the entraining agent 
used is steam. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein steam at from 1 
to 20 bar is fed in. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
polyacrylate melt is circulated at least once, preferably 

several times. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the 
polymerization and distillation are carried out in a 1-kettle 

plant or a 2-kettle plant. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, which is particularly 
suitable for the preparation of polyacrylate melts 

having glass transition temperatures of from -50 to 0°C, preferably 
from -45 to -5°C. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, which is particularly 
suitable for the preparation of polyacrylate melts 

having K values of from 10 to 120, preferably from 15 to 80, 
particularly preferably from 20 to 60.  

 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, which is particularly 
suitable for the preparation of polyacrylate melts 

which are suitable as a raw material base for UV-crosslinkable 
hotmelt adhesives. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, which is particularly 
suitable for the preparation of polyacrylate melts 

which are suitable as flexible resins for plasticizing coating 
and adhesive raw materials.
