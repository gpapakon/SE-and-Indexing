<ABSTRACT>
The present invention consists in a method of preparing amino thiohydantoins either in isolation or as the C-terminals residue of a peptide. The method comprises reacting the amino acid or peptide with an acylating agent and thiocyanate or isothiocyanate in the presence of a strong acid. The present invention also relates to an improved method for C-terminal sequencing of peptides which routinely analyses all of the common amino acids of peptides. The invention involves the use of a strong, volatile, anhydrous organic or mineral acid to cleave the terminal amino acid thiohydantoin.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF AMINO ACID THIOHYDANTOINSField of the InventionThe present invention consists in a method of preparing amino acid thiohydantoins either in isolation or as the C-terminal residue of a peptide. The method of the present invention is particularly useful in the preparation of proline thiohydantoins. The present invention also relates to an improved method of C-terminal peptide sequencing involving the preparation and cleavage of amino acid thiohydantoins. Background of the InventionThe search for a chemical method for step wise removal of amino acids from the C-terminal end of proteins began early in this century when Schlack and Kumpf(Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 154: 125, 1926) applied the method of Johnson and Nicolet (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 33: 1973, 1911), for conversion of acyla ino acids to acylthiohydantoins, to a small peptide, and then cleaved the thiohydantoins from the molecule with IM sodium hydroxide. While alternative chemistries have been proposed over the years scientists have periodically attempted to utilize or modify the Schlack and Kumpf degradation procedure for C-terminal sequence analysis. None of the procedures proposed have, however, led to an accepted routine determination.It has been recognised that the major hurdle to clear before full rewards can be obtained from application of the thiohydantoin procedure is the difficulty in producing prolyl residues.Currently workers in the field are using different reagents to form thiohydantoins of amino acids. None of them have claimed to be successful with these reagents for proline. Earlier workers, Kubo et al. (Chem. Pharm. Bull. 19: 210, 1971), claim that acetyl proline and proline 

in two peptides reacted well at 30 with a two step reaction consisting of acetyl chloride-trifluoroacetic acid treatment, then addition of thiocyanic acid dissolved in dioxane. Unfortunately, this procedure is not a good practical solution, partly because of difficulties in preparing and storing the thiocyanic acid and it has not been elaborated by others in the field.Earlier papers by the present inventors have reported the successful application of a thiohydantoin procedure to both manual and automatic C-terminal sequence analysis of peptides and proteins. With the exception of proline, all amino acids that might have been expected to give difficulties were shown to be degraded normally in peptides (Inglis et al In: Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis, Ed. Wittman-Liebold, 1989; Inglis et al In: Modern Methods in Protein and
