Device for connecting a data processing apparatus 
to a transmission channel or medium, with a view to its 

participation in a computer network, comprising: 

a network-interface (I;RE) , capable of 
sending/receiving messages on the channel, with 

monitoring of the channel in order to establish event 
signals which selectively represent the detection of the 

start of a transmission on the channel, the detection of 
any new collision and the detection of the return of the 

channel to the vacant state, 
a send/receive handling device (DG), for managing 
the network-interface on the basis of the event signals, 

and 
a means whereby, in the case of a collision with 
regard to local sending, the send is maintained with 

collision signalling for at least a first minimum 
duration (C), after which all transmission is 

interrupted, 
 
characterized in that it comprises a channel observation 

register (RO) which receives the event signals and in 
response establishes a so-called channel observation 

signal, this observation signal having a predetermined 
set of possible states, which set comprises successful 

transmission (sending or receiving), "collision slot", or 
"vacant slot", whereas observation register refresh 

instants are defined at least at each vacant channel 
event,
 
and in that the handling device (DG) comprises means for 

reacting to a request to send a new data packet by: 

a) a normal mode consisting in awaiting the next  
 

refresh of the observation register and in performing or 
not performing a first send attempt, on the basis of a 

predetermined criterion, applied to the state of the 
observation register, before this refresh, 
b) in the case of failure (send refusal or collision), 

b1) the initialization of a running integer (E), to a 
value lying between a first (0) and a second (M-1) limit 

integer, inclusive, 
b2) modification of the running integer (E) at each 
change of state of the observation register, according to 

a predetermined law which tends to move the running 
integer away from the first limit-integer (0) in case of 

abundance of collision slots, and to move it towards this 
limit in case of abundance of vacant slots, 
 
a return to the normal mode a) being authorized only when 

the running integer (E) has reached the first limit-integer 
(0), so that the reaction of the handling device 

to a request to send a new data packet is independent of 
the past history of the channel, upstream of the last 

normal mode executed. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the predetermined criterion comprises the absence of 

any collision slot. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the transmission (successful) 

observation is noted, after a start of transmission 
event, upon a channel vacant event not preceded by a 

collision since the start of transmission; in that the 
collision time slot observation is noted at the channel 

vacant event which follows the said sending with 
collision signalling; and in that the channel vacant 

observation is noted when the channel vacant event has 
endured for a second minimum duration (B). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the initial value of the chosen 

integer (E) is substantially random. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the running integer is also moved 

towards the first limit-integer in the presence of a  
 

collision-free transmission. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the said predetermined law 

comprises: 

as long as the running integer (E) is not equal to 
the first limit-integer (0), incrementing the running 

integer by a first chosen increment (M-1), if the state 

of the channel is collision slot, or decrementing the 
running integer by a second chosen increment (1) if the 

state of the channel is vacant slot, the ratio of the 
first increment to the second being substantially equal 

to the gap (M-1) between the two limit-integers. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the sending/receiving handling 

device (DG) is send-disabled if a collision state already 
exists when it receives a send request. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the gap (M-1) between the two 

limit-integers is substantially equal to the integer part 
of the ratio of the first duration (C) to the second (B). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the chosen integer (E) is delivered 

by a pseudo-random generator (GPA) operating on an 
integer of at least 10 bits, modulated by at least one 

integer of at most 10 bits, which is specific to the 
relevant apparatus, the result being referred back to the 

interval of the limits of the said chosen integer (E). 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the chosen integer (E) is delivered by a pseudo-random 

generator (GPA) operating on an integer of at 
least 10 bits, modulated by at least one integer of at 

most 10 bits, which is specific to the relevant 
apparatus, and by a clock integer, the result being 

referred back to the interval of the limits of the said 
chosen integer (E). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the send requests are accompanied 

by a priority cue, picked from a predetermined set of 
priority classes; and in that the handling device (DG)  

 
logs, for each priority class, a quantity (P
i
) 
representing the congestion factor for the transmission 

medium, having regard to priority, whereas any request in 
progress is taken into account only if the said quantity, 

for its priority class, is in a predetermined 
relationship with a random quantity (g(t)). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that each quantity (P
i
) varies according to a 
predetermined law dependent on the said observation 

signal, in order to increase the congestion which it 
represents in the case of a collision slot, and to 

decrease it in the case of a vacant slot. 
Device according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the quantity (p
i
) is also modified in order to 
decrease the congestion which it represents, in the 

presence of a collision-free transmission. 
Device according to one of Claims 11 to 13, 
characterized in that the quantities (p
i
) and the random 
quantity (g(t)) are normalized to one, the predetermined 

relationship being a comparison of the random quantity 
with the relevant representative quantity (p
i
) . 
Process for resolving collisions in a data 
transmission network of the random access type, in which 

each apparatus is furnished with a network-interface for 
sending/receiving on a transmission medium or channel, 

with monitoring of the channel so as to establish event 
signals which selectively represent the detection of a 

start of transmission, the detection of any new 
collision, and the detection of the return of the channel 

to the vacant state, 

in which, following a request to send a data packet, the 
packet is sent upon obtaining the channel vacant state, 

with, in the absence of any collision in regard to this 
sending, validation of the sending of the data packet in 

progress and return to the awaiting of a request to send 
another data packet, 
whereas in the presence of a collision in regard to this 
sending, the sending is prolonged for a first chosen 

duration (C), referred to as the "collision slot", and  
 

then interrupted; 
 
characterized in that in response to any event signal, a 

channel observation signal is established from among a 
predetermined set of possibilities, this set comprising 

transmission (sending or receiving), "collision slot" and 
"vacant slot", the collision time slot being restricted 

to a first minimum duration (C), starting from any new 
collision detection, and the vacant slot existing only 

when the channel vacant state has endured for a second 
minimum duration (B), at least equal to the maximum round 

trip propagation time of a signal on the channel, and 
less than the first minimum duration (C),
 
and in that, in the presence of a collision, 


i) a running integer (E) is initialized to a value 
lying between a first (0) and a second (M-1) limitinteger, 

inclusive, 
ii) at each new observation, the running integer (E) is 
varied, according to a predetermined law dependent on 

the said observation, in order to move it away from the 
first limit-integer (0) in case of abundance of collision 

slots, and to move it towards this limit in case of 
abundance of vacant slots, 
iii) sending being possible only when the running integer 
(E) reaches the first limit-integer (0).
