<ABSTRACT>
A scalable method and system for easily scheduling 
data transfer or a a video-on-demand server system is 

provided. A strategy for locating available bandwidth and 
allocating available bandwidth to subscribers as needed is 

provided. The input/output bandwidth of storage devices that 
store data for video image sequences is modelled as a series 

of bandwidth units. Each bandwidth unit has sufficient 
capacity to service an individual subscriber during a 

scheduling cycle. Video image sequences or other data 
sequences are striped across storage devices such that data 

for a data sequence is forwarded to the subscriber by reading 
from a sequence of storage devices in consecutive time frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to data
processing systems and, more particularly, to video-on-demand
systems.Most conventional cable video systems provide
subscribers with a number of different viewing choices.
The different viewing choices are broadcast on separate
channels, and a subscriber selects a viewing choice by
tuning their television to the channel associated with the
viewing choice. The number of viewing choices is limited
by the number of available channels. An additional
limitation in conventional cable video system is that the
times at which the viewing choices begin are fixed.One service provided in conventional cable video
systems that has gained popularity is pay-per-view
channels. Pay-per-view channels make available to
subscribers selected viewing choices that start playing at
fixed times. A subscriber contacts a cable station to
request that he view a viewing choice that is being
provided on a pay-per-view channel at a fixed time. The
cable station responsible for programming the pay-per-view
channel then switches the connection to the subscriber so
that the viewer receives the broadcast of the requested
viewing choice beginning at the designated start time.
Different viewing choices are output on respective
channels.WO-A-91 03112 discloses a program transmission cable TV network in which a
maximum response time corresponding to a maximum time a user needs to wait until a
requested program is started to be played is selected. The program is divided into a
plurality of segments of a length which ensures that at least one segment can be
transmitted in the maximum response time. The segments are transmitted in
accordance with a scheduling algorithm. The length of the segments ensures that at a
user's receiver the program is continuously played back in real time.WO-A-92 12599 discloses a transmission and receiving system with user controlled
access. The program material is compressed and formatted into a sequence of data
blocks which are stored on multiple mass storage devices. A transmitter transmits at
least a portion of the compressed data to a user station.Both conventional cable systems and pay-per-view
systems have a number of limitations. The present  
invention eliminates these limitations. In accordance
with a first aspect of the present invention, a method is
practiced in a system having a sequence of storage devices
for storing data sequences. The data sequence includes
blocks of data that are stored as stripes across the
sequence of storage devices. The data sequence
