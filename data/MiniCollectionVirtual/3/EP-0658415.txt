<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing hollow objects made of thermoplastic materials, the walls of which are subjected to a treatment with a fluorine-containing gas mixture for the purpose of influencing the permeation properties. The method can be used in particular for fuel tanks in order to reduce the permeability of their walls, in particular irrespective of the alcohol content of the fuel. In this case, two treatment steps are provided, the first of which works with a gas mixture which contains fluorine and oxygen. In a second treatment step, following later, a gas mixture which contains fluorine but is free from oxygen is used.

A process for the production of hollow bodies from a thermoplastic
synthetic polymer by blow moulding and fluorination, in which a preferably

tubular preform is formed and expanded within a blow moulding mould using
a gaseous pressure agent until it bears against the internal contour of

the blow moulding mould and the internal wall of the resulting hollow body
is treated within the blow moulding mould by a gas or gas mixture of which

at least one component reacts with the synthetic material forming the
hollow body wall in order to make it less permeable in relation to at

least one substance, characterised in that in a first treatment step the
hollow body wall is treated with a gas mixture which contains fluorine and

oxygen and thereafter in a second treatment step the hollow body is
treated with a gas mixture which contains fluorine but no oxygen.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the two
treatment steps are effected in immediate succession.
A process according to claim 2 characterised in that between the
first treatment step and the second treatment step the hollow body is

purged with an inert gas for removing at least the oxygen from the hollow
body.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the fluorine
content in the treatment gas during the second treatment step is greater

than during the first treatment step.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the period of
action of the gas mixture during the second treatment step is longer than

during the first treatment step.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the container
is cooled between the first treatment step and the second treatment step. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the first
treatment step is carried out at temperatures above the crystallite fusion

temperature of the polymer.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the treatment
in the first treatment step is effected using a gas mixture which contains

0.01 to 5% by volume of fluorine.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the treatment
in the first treatment step is effected with a gas mixture which contains

0.5 to 25% by volume of oxygen.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the period of
action of the gas mixture during the first treatment step is from 5 to 60

seconds.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the second
treatment step is carried out with a gas mixture which contains only

fluorine and inert gas.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the second
treatment step is carried out at temperatures below the crystallite fusion

temperature of the polymer.
A process according to claim 12 characterised in that the second
treatment step is carried out at ambient temperature.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the treatment
in the second treatment step is carried out using a gas mixture which

contains from 0.5 to 20% by weight of fluorine.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the period of
action of the gas mixture during the second treatment step is from 10

seconds to 120 minutes. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the first
treatment step is carried out within the blow moulding mould.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the second
treatment step is carried out within the blow moulding mould.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the second
step is carried out outside the blow moulding mould.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the preform is
expanded using a gas or gas mixture which contains no fluorine.
A hollow body produced by an extrusion blow moulding process, in
particular a fuel tank, which at least predominantly comprises a

thermoplastic synthetic polymer, in particular of ethylene or propylene,
characterised in that the nature of the internal surface of the hollow

body is produced by treatment firstly with a gas mixture which contains
fluorine and oxygen and thereafter in a second treatment step with a gas

mixture which contains fluorine but which is oxygen-free.
