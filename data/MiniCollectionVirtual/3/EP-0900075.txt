No. 5,013,556 (5/1991).Cosmetic formulations containing lipids are well known. Lipids can function to
produce the desired consistency and viscosity in a formulation and, more importantly,
to help replenish lipids in the skin. Since most lipids commonly used in cosmetic formulations contain unsaturated
chains, such formulations are susceptible to oxidation. Oxidative damage can lead to
loss of alkyl chains, which results in loss of fluidity and lipophilic properties, e.g., the
ability to replenish lipids in the skin and thus impart suppleness and youthful
appearance. Oxidation can also lead to discoloration and development of unpleasant
odors. Oxidative damage can be attributed, in particular, to radiation-induced free
radical reactions.In addition to minimizing oxidation, it is desirable to enhance the moisturizing
properties of cosmetic formulations; i.e., the amount of moisture that can be retained
by the skin when the formulation is applied. Increased moisturizing effectiveness is
also important in topical therapeutic lipid formulations, such as are used in treating dry
eyes.Finally, it is desirable that the lipids themselves are stable; e.g., that they not be
readily oxidized or hydrolyzed.EP-A-0 370 481 is directed to small-sized liposomes containing certain
monophosphate and diphosphate compounds. EP-A-0 370 481 is not concerned
