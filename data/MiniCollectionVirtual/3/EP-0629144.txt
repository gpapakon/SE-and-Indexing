Apparatus for effecting simultaneously or 
sequentially occurring chemical reaction
s, having the 
features: 


a) four horizontally disposed bars (1, 2, 3, 4) are 
disposed above one another; 
b) the outer bars (1, 4) each have a contact face 
(5), and the central bars (2, 3) each have two 

oppositely situated contact faces (5), via which they 
are in contact with one another; 
c) the contact faces (5) are processed and pressed 
towards one another in such a manner that 


the bars are displaceable horizontally relative to 
one another, 
the contact faces effect a fluid-tight sealing; 
d) the first bar (1) 

has a plurality of continuous bores (6) and 
is firmly connected to the apparatus; 
e) the second bar (2), which is in contact with the 
first bar (1), 


is firmly connected to a carrier plate (7), which is 
horizontally displaceable relative to the first bar (1), 

and 
has a continuous bore (8); 
f) the third bar (3), which is in contact with the 
second bar (2), 


is horizontally displaceably mounted on the carrier 
plate (7) and 
has a number 
n
 of reaction chambers (9), which are 
provided with apertures at its upper and lower ends; 
g) the fourth bar (4), which is in contact with the 
third bar (3), 


is firmly connected to the carrier plate (7), and 
has a continuous bore (10); 
h 
n
 different positions of the third bar (3) can 
be set relative to the second (2) and fourth (4) bars, 

wherein the bores (8, 10) and the apertures of one of 
the reaction chambers (9) establish a continuous 

connection. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the bores (8, 10) of the second (2) and fourth (4) 

bars extend vertically and lie on a common straight 
line. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the bores (6) of the first bar (1) 

are connected in a fluid-tight manner to reagent lines 
(12). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the bore (10) of the fourth bar 

(4) is connected in a fluid-tight manner to a line (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in 
that a pump (14) is inserted in the line (13). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the bores (6) in the first bar (1) 

and the upper and lower apertures of the reaction 
chambers (9) in the third bar (3) are each provided at a 

constant spacing. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 6, 
characterised in that the third bar (3) is displaced 

horizontally relative to the carrier plate (7) by a 
structural element in such a manner that the bores (8) 

and (10) of the second (2) and fourth (4) bars are in  
 

alignment with the upper and lower apertures of one of 
the reaction chambers (9). 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the structural element is a stop member. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the structural element is a first stepping motor. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the carrier plate (7) is 

horizontally displaced by a second stepping motor. 
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the first stepping motor is controlled by a 

computer. 
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterised 
in that the second stepping motor is controlled by a 

computer. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the pump (14) is controlled by a computer. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the third bar (3) contains a continuous bore (15), 

which is provided at a constant spacing relative to the 
upper and lower apertures of one of the reaction 

chambers (9). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the bars (1, 2, 3, 4) are formed from a machinable 

glass.
