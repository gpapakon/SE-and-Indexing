<ABSTRACT>
A photographic printer for printing negative images 
on a negative film onto photographic paper. The printing 

direction can be changed over between "lateral" and 
"longitudinal" without changing the feed direction of the 

negative film (F). A reflecting mirror (7) is inclined by 45° with 
respect to the optical axis of the light emitted from a 

light source (1) to the negative film (F) and is supported to be 
rotatable about the optical axis. A driving unit (10) is 

provided to rotate the reflecting mirror (7) by 90° about the 
optical axis between a reference position and a second 

position. Exposure stages (17,18) are provided on the optical axes 
of the light beams reflected by the reflecting mirror (7) when 

the mirror is in its reference position and second 
position, respectively. The photographic paper (P) is guided 

through the exposure stages (17,18). According to the position of 
the mirror (7), negative images are printed on the paper (P) at one 

of the two exposure stages (17,18). Thus, the printing position 
can be changed over between lateral and longitudinal by 

turning the mirror (7) between its reference position and 
second position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photographic printer in accordance
with the generic clause of claim 1 for printing negative images
on a negative film onto a web of photographic paper.Such a printer is already well known in the prior art as shown
in Figures 10A,10B which will be discussed later in more detail.Document DE 3412691 shows a photographic printer, wherein a
negative film is turned 90° in order to enable the projection of
frames that are provided perpendicular to each other on the film
in a longitudinal direction.Document DE 4003549 discloses a photographic printer, whereby
light is transmitted to one exposure stage when a mirror is
moved in the light path and is transmitted to the other exposure
stage when the mirror is moved out of the light path.Generally, the negative images on a negative film F
as shown in Fig. 9A are printed on photographic paper in
the manner as shown in Fig. 9B or 9C.In the method of Fig. 9B, the image on each frame a
of the negative film F is printed on the paper P so that
the long sides of the frame correspond to the width
direction of the paper P. This method is called "lateral
printing". The method of Fig. 9C is called "longitudinal
printing" because the images are printed so that the short
sides of the frames a correspond to the width direction of
the paper P. Figs. 10A, 10B show a conventional photographic
printer. This photographic printer has a light source unit
50 for irradiating a negative film F carried by a negative
mask 51. The negative images are enlarged by a printing
lens 52, reflected by a mirror 53 and printed on
photographic paper P.The printing lens 52 may be provided between the
light source unit 50 and the negative mask 51 or between
the negative mask 51 and the mirror 53. In order to "lateral-print" the negative images on
the negative film F onto the paper P, the negative film F
is fed laterally with respect to the photographic paper P,
which is fed vertically as shown in Fig. 10A. For
"longitudinal printing", the negative film has to be turned
90° from the above position to feed it in a longitudinal
direction toward the paper P.It is necessary to change the feed direction of the
negative film not only when changing the printing
direction, but when changing the print size e.g. from size
E to size 2E or when the film size is changed from half-size
to full-size.As described above, printing work with conventional
photographic printers was very troublesome because the feed
direction of the negative film F had to be turned 90° every
time there was a change
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A photographic printer comprising a light source unit (1) for illuminating a negative
film (F,F1), on to which a negative image is recorded, fed in one direction, a

negative film mask through which the negative film (F) is fed, a printer lens (6), a
reflecting member (7) aligned with an axis connecting said light source unit (1)

and the negative image surface in said negative film mask and inclined by a
predetermined angle with respect to said axis the printer further comprising:


driving means (10) for turning the reflecting member (7) 90° about said axis
between a reference position and a second position,
locking means (14,15,16ab) for locking said reflecting member (7) in one of said

reference position and said second position,
characterized by
first and second exposure stages (17,18) arranged along the axis of the light
reflected by said reflecting member when it is in said reference position and in

said second position, respectively, wherein said first and second exposure stages
(17) are oriented perpendicularly to each other with a photographic paper web

passing through the first and second exposure stage, or with a first photographic
paper web (P1) passing through the first exposure stage and with a second

photographic paper web (P2) passing through the second exposure stage,
wherein in said first exposure state the negative image is longitudinally printed
onto the photographic paper web or the first photographic paper web so that the

short side of the printed image corresponds to the width direction of the 
photographic paper web or of said first photographic paper web and in the second

exposure stage the negative image is printed laterally onto the photographic
paper web or the second photographic paper web so that the long side of the

printed image corresponds to the width direction of the photographic paper web or
of said second photographic paper web.
