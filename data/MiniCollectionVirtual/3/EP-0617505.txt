<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement is described for regulating the rotation speed of electric motors by means of a phase-gating controller, in the case of which circuit arrangement the armature and the field windings of the electric motor are connected in series with an electronic module having switch characteristics. The electronic module is driven by electronics having a required-value transmitter (11) for setting the rotation speed. This required-value transmitter (11), which emits to the electronics a control voltage Us which correlates with the rotation speed, consists of a linear potentiometer (24) and two fixed resistors R1, R2 which form a voltage divider (27) and are connected between the supply voltage Uv of the required-value transmitter (11) and earth, as well as a component (29) which is connected between the wiper connection (28) of the linear potentiometer (24) and the junction point (32) of the two fixed resistors R1, R2 and has an electrical valve effect. The control voltage Us for the electronics is picked off at the junction (31) between the component (29) having the electrical valve effect and the wiper connection (28) of the potentiometer (24).
