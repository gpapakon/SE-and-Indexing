<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to uncrosslinked
polyethylene particles to be expanded and uncrosslinked
polyethylene expanded particles obtained therefrom.A method of molding expanded particles of uncrosslinked
straight-chain low-density polyethylene (hereinafter
abbreviated to LLDPE) in a mold is suggested in Japanese
Patent Publication No. 10047/1985, but in the case of
expanded particles whose base resin is a polyethylene such
as LLDPE, unless the expanded particles are given
expandability for pressure pretreatment, satisfactory
secondary expansion in a mold is not effected and it is
difficult to obtain good molded products because the heating
temperature range at the molding of the expanded particles
in which a good molded product can be obtained is narrow and
the adjustment of satisfactory heating to a proper heating
temperature at the molding of the expanded particles is
difficult and because of the crystalline structure of the
polyethylene. Therefore, when uncrosslinked straight-chain
low-density polyethylene expanded particles are molded,
generally, a technique is used wherein, prior to the
molding, the same expanding agent gas or an inorganic gas,
such as air, is further added to increase the internal
pressure. However, this technique wherein the same
expanding gas or an inorganic gas is further added to
expanded particles is attended with the problem that not
only the equipments are massive but also the number of steps
increases, leading to a high production cost of the molded
products. Further, in general, in the case of polyolefin 
resin expanded particles, even if the internal pressure is
increased by further adding an inorganic gas or the like to
give expandability to the expanded particles, since the
pressure in the particles easily escapes, it is difficult to
keep the expandability for a long period of time, and
therefore in order to obtain excellent molded products by
the conventional technique, after giving the internal
pressure, the expanded particles have to be used in a short
period of time, so that the molder cannot produce molded
products easily by using simply the expanded particles
directly supplied from the producer of the expanded
particles.As means of solving these problems, the applicant
suggested, as LLDPE expanded particles capable of being
molded without specifically giving an internal pressure,
LLDPE expanded particles having a crystalline structure
wherein two endothermic peaks appear in a DSC curve obtained
by differential scanning calorimetry (hereinafter referred
