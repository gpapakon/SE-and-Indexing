<ABSTRACT>
The process for preparing an ion exchanger polymeric material containing sulphonic functional groups of the invention consists in:   a) grafting onto the said material an ethylenically unsaturated monomer containing a tertiary amine functional group, for example morpholinoethyl or dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate,   b) reacting sodium sulphite with the material thus grafted.   The material obtained according to the operating conditions contains sulphonic functional groups by themselves or in combination with tertiary amine functional groups. In this latter case it is a mixed exchanger.
