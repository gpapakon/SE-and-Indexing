<ABSTRACT>
Described is an aqueous composition comprising     (a) a bleach-regulating component,   (b) a magnesium salt of an organic carboxylic acid, and   (c) a preservative. The present composition is suitable for use as a bleaching liquor for cellulosic fibre materials and is notable for a high stabilising effect, a high binding capacity for heavy metal ions, a good crystallisation-inhibiting effect and very good rewettability of the treated fibre materials. A significant advantage of the composition of the invention is its biodegradability. Also described are novel chitosan derivatives and the preparation thereof.
