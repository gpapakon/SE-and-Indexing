<ABSTRACT>
A filter unit for tubes of dental aspiration 
apparatus, comprising a box structure (1) 

containing a collector (2) connected by a first 
conduit (3) to a suction pump (not shown) and, to second 

conduits 66' each controlled by an interposed 
valve (4,4'); each of the second 

conduits comprises a syphon in a central part 
wherein is situated a chamber housing a filter 

for the fluid aspirated by the tube; the filters 
being mechanically connected one to another in a 

single filter sequence and separated by a closed 
wall; the filters being inserted through an 

aperture into the unit, and the closed wall 
forming a separating wall between the chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
Aspiration apparatus for dental use is provided
with suction tubes used to aspirate blood and
saliva, remove water and other extraneous
substances from a patient's mouth during dental
treatment.When not in use, the tubes are placed in forked
seats or the like, usually mounted on a rest
forming part of a console, whereat the source of
the depression creating the aspiration is also
located, and to which source of depression they
are connected by an end of their flexible tubes.The tubes, through a further tube attached to the
console, are thence connected to a suction pump
creating a depression inside the console itself.Devices such as pneumatic valves are normally
provided inside the console to interrupt
aspiration automatically when the tube is placed
on the rest: these valves are generally commanded
by a switch in turn activated by the tube, through
pneumatic distributors or solenoid valves of known 
type.During aspiration, the fluid entrained in the tube
crosses the valves and descends into a collector,
wherein a filter effecting a first filtering of
the fluid is situated; downstream of the filter
the filtered fluid is expelled from the console
through the tube connecting the apparatus to the
suction pump.Such a console-cum-filter plant apparatus is
described in patent EP 0040181 (US 43869110), by
the same applicant.The major drawback exhibited by these apparatus is
that the valves have to be cleaned out very
frequently as the aspirated fluids form residual
crusts, which would soon lead to unsatisfactory
functioning if left to harden.In an attempt to obviate this drawback, filters
have been inserted directly into the tubes in
order to effect a first filtration:
such a filter unit is described in EP - A - 0 214 105, which discloses all the features of
the preamble of claim 1 and wherein each single suction tube is provided with distinct
filtering means located upstream of the pneumatic valve. This
solution,
though, apart from leading to the need to equip
each separate tube with its own filter, also
necessitates using very small filters in the
individual tubes, which block up even more
quickly.A principal aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the above-mentioned drawback by providing
a filter plant which is constructionally simple
but which helps to reduce the number of cleaning
operations necessary, especially where the
pneumatic valves are concerned.A significant advantage of the filter plant is
that at the same time as solving the above
problems, one large filter alone is used.These aims and

<CLAIMS>
A filter plant for tubes of dental aspiration
apparatus, comprising

a box structure (1) containing a collector (2)
connected by a first conduit (3) to a suction pump

and, with an interposition of a pneumatic valve
(4, 4' ), also to each tube by second conduits (6,

6'); further comprising means for effecting a
first filtering of fluids aspirated by the tubes,

characterised in that inside the filter plant and
upstream of the pneumatic valve (4, 4'), each of

the second conduits (6, 6') comprises a syphon
(6a, 6a') at a central part whereof is situated a

chamber (6b, 6b') housing a filter (7, 7'); said
filter (7, 7') being upwardly open and being

provided with perforated walls, and being arranged
in the downward tract of the syphon (6a, 6a')

such as to be crossed down in a downwards direction by the fluids
coming from

each of the tubes.
A plant as in claim 1, characterised in that a
filter is provided for each tube, and that a

resulting plurality of filters (7, 7') are
mechanically interconnected one to another in a 

single longitudinally-developing filter sequence
(15), and that at least one filter (7, 7')

exhibits a closed wall (8) provided, at a side
facing a next filter, with a sealing element; each

filter (7, 7') exhibiting a straight constant
section, and each filter being of a narrower

section than a preceding filter; the syphons (6a,
6a') being connected one to another through an

aperture (9) afforded in a closed sealing surface
(10) on which the sealing element of the closed

wall (8) adheres, a size and shape of the aperture
(9) being such as to permit passage of a part of

the filter sequence destined to be located on a
far side of said wall (8); a through hole (12)

being made on an external wall of the plant for
allowing introduction of the filter sequence into

the plant.
A plant as in claim 2, characterised in that the
filters (7, 7') comprise projecting longitudinal

edges (13, 13') made laterally to an open upper
part of the filters (7,7'); the chambers (6b, 6b')

comprising longitudinal projections (14, 14')
offering a rest surface for the longitudinal

edges (13, 13').
