<ABSTRACT>
A well screen for separating particulate material 
from formation fluid, comprises a tubular body (58) of 

sintered, substantially spherical plastics members (60), the 
body (58) having a bore defining a production flow passage. 

Preferably, there is also an inner (44) and an outer (42) 
screen concentrically mounted in radially spaced relation 

around a perforated mandrel (38), thereby defining a prepack 
annulus in which the spherical plastics members (60) are 

disposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a well screen for 
use in completing downhole wells, and in particular to a well 
screen for filtering unconsolidated material out of inflowing 
well fluid in water, oil, gas and recovery wells. In the course of completing an oil and/or gas well, 
it is usual to first run a string of casing into the well bore 
and then run the production tubing inside the casing. At the 
site of the producing formation, the casing is perforated 
across one or more production zones to allow hydrocarbons to 
enter the casing bore. After the well is completed and placed 
in production, formation sand from unconsolidated formations 
may be swept into the flow path along with formation fluid. 
This sand is relatively fine and erodes production components 
in the flow path. In some completions, however, the well bore 
is uncased, and an open face is established across the oil or 
gas bearing zone. Such open bore hole arrangements are 
utilized, for example, in water wells, test wells and 
horizontal well completions. Similarly, after the well is 
completed and placed in production, formation sand from 
unconsolidated formations may also be swept into the flow path 
along with formation fluid. With either cased or uncased well bores, one or more 
sand screens are installed in the flow path between the 
production tubing and the perforated casing. A packer may be 
set above and below the sand screen to seal off the annulus in  
 
the producing zone from non-producing formations. Conventionally, the annulus around the screen in 
unconsolidated formations is packed with a relatively coarse 
sand or gravel which acts as a filter to reduce the amount of 
fine formation sand reaching the screen. To spot the gravel 
around the screen, a work string and service seal unit (SSU) is 
used. During completion, the service seal unit is employed to 
pump gravel through the work string where the gravel is 
squeezed into the producing formation around the screen. The 
gravel is pumped down the work string in a slurry of water or 
gel and is spotted to fill the annulus between the sand screen 
and the well casing. In well installations in which the screen 
is suspended in an uncased open bore, the gravel pack supports 
the surrounding unconsolidated formation. However, with either cased well bores or uncased well 
bores, some spaces may remain that are not filled with gravel. 
These spaces eventually fill up with accumulated sand, which 
form sand plugs or bridges. Thus, fine formation sand finds 
its way

production flow passage, said mandrel (38) being radially 
intersected by at least one flow aperture (40) connecting with 

said flow passage; and wherein said substantially spherical 
plastic members (60) are disposed along at least a portion of 

said mandrel (38) covering said flow aperture (40).

sintered, spherical plastic members (60) are formed into a 

cylindrical shape which is disposed concentrically around said 
tubular mandrel (38). 
A well screen according to Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein 
each of said spherical plastic members (60) is acid resistant 

and corrosion resistant. 
A well screen according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
wherein each of said spherical members (60) has essentially the 

same diameter. 
A well screen according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
which further comprises a fluid-porous, particulate-restricting 

member (42) mounted on said sintered, spherical plastic members 
(60). 
A well screen according to Claim 6, wherein said 
particulate-restricting member (42) is a cylindrical 

particulate-restricting member positioned concentrically over 
said spherical plastic members (60). 
A well screen according to Claim 6 or 7, wherein said 
particulate-restricting member (42) includes a plurality of 

longitudinally extending rib wires (52) circumferentially 
spaced around said sintered, spherical plastic members (60), 

and a screen wire (50) wrapped externally about said rib wires 
(52) in a longitudinally spaced pattern, said rib wires (52) 

and said screen wire (50) defining a plurality of 
longitudinally spaced screen apertures for conducting formation 

fluids through said particulate-restricting member (42), said 
longitudinally extending rib wires (52) being disposed between 

said external screen wire (50) and said sintered, spherical 
plastic members (60). 
A well screen according to any of Claims 1 to 8, 
which comprises a cylindrical inner screen (44) positioned 

inside the tubular body (58) of sintered, spherical plastic 
members (60).
