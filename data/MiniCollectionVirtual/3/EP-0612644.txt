<ABSTRACT>
An air bag employing a twill-like fabric having right hand and 
left hand diagonally extending twill lines (10,12) which form a diamond 

shaped portion therebetween. The diamond portion can be of a 
plain weave or other type of means depending on the desired 

fabric porosity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a new and improved woven
fabric and in particular to a woven fabric for use in air bags
having intersecting diagonal twill lines.Traditionally fabrics used for "air bag" usage have been of
a plain weave, rip stop, or basket weave construction. At
certain densities or yarn sizes these constructions can have
other than desired properties of stiffness, tear strength, or gas
permeability. Fabrics made from twill constructions are more
flexible, tear resistant, and have higher gas permeability than a
plain weave fabric for a given construction and weight. Fabric
made from one of the many twill constructions in common use in
the textile industry has the disadvantage of having more stretch
when pulled on one diagonal direction than when pulled from the
other. The permeability of twill fabric to gas may be too high
for certain applications. EP 0442373 A discloses an airbag adapted to be used in
conjunction with an airbag equipment in a motor vehicle
comprising an inflatable bag formed using fabric. This
fabric has at least one portion comprising a woven
fabric, said woven fabric having a plurality of cross-twill
lines being suitable for use in the gas-releasing
portion of an airbag. Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide a
woven fabric with intersecting diagonal twill lines
as defined in claim 1 which is
particularly useful in the production of air bags for automotive
use. Other objects and advantages of the invention will
become readily apparent as the specification proceeds
to describe the invention with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic cross-section view of a typical air
bag installation mounted in a steering wheel;Figure 2 is a schematic view showing the air bag of Figure 1
in expanded condition; andFigures 3 - 5 are schematic representations of the new and
improved woven fabric which can be employed in the air bag of
Figures 1 and 2 as well as other types of air bags.The air bag equipment as installed on a fixed portion of a
car body in front of a car seat plays an important role for the
protection of a person in the car from injury due to the
collision of the car body as the air bag is instantaneously
inflated at the collision of the vehicle by the pressure of
reaction gas released from an inflator, which is fixed on a
steering wheel or dashboard.In such air bag equipment 1, for example, chemical reaction
of gas generating agent is induced by a collision signal from a
collision detection sensor when the vehicle

<CLAIMS>
An air bag (1) adapted to be used in conjunction
with air bag equipment in a motor vehicle

comprising: an inflatable bag (1) formed using
fabric (3), said fabric (3) having at least one

portion of a woven fabric, said woven fabric
having a plurality of diagonal twill lines (10,

12) characterised in that the diagonal lines (10,
12) run right and left forming a plurality of

diamond shaped areas (16) therebetween.
An air bag (1) as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said
woven fabric (3) is comprised of substantially

100% continuous filament synthetic yarn.
An air bag (1) as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2
wherein said yarn is polyester.
An air bag (1) as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2
wherein said yarn is nylon.
An air bag (1) as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4
wherein the formed diamond portions (16) in one

portion of said fabric are smaller (18) than the
diamond portions in other portions of said fabric

(20).
An air bag (1) as claimed in Claim 1 wherein at
least one of the warp yarns (22) in each diamond

portion (16) is floated over a plurality of fill
yarns (21) in the same diamond portion (16) to

change the porosity thereof.
An air bag (1) as claimed in Claim 6 wherein said
woven fabric (3) is comprised of substantially 

100% continuous filament synthetic yarn.
An air bag (1) as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7
wherein said yarn is polyester.
An air bag (1) as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7
wherein said yarn is nylon.

wherein at least one of the warp yarns (22) in

each diamond portion (16) is floated over a
plurality of fill yarns (21) in the same diamond

portion (14) to change the porosity thereof.
