<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of United States Application Serial No. 
07/781,459; filed October 24, 1991. This invention relates to thermoplastic compositions useful in wire 
coating applications and more particularly to such compositions which are 
halogen-free and useful in high temperature resistant wire coating 
applications. Due to the increasing density of components under the hood of 
today's high performance cars, temperature requirements of the insulation 
materials of wires and cables used in such applications become more and 
more demanding. This is the more important as the current working horse 
for these applications, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is being considered more 
and more as an environmental threat, and the industry is therefore looking 
for a halogen-free, thermoplastic and high temperature resistant material 
which would fulfil the requirements of today's cars and be able to replace 
PVC at the same time. Today's requirements consist of retaining sufficient 
elongation after 3000h at 135Â°C while showing a minimum of discoloration, 
good chemical resistance, and good low temperature flexibility. Some materials described in published European Patent Application 
No. EP-290 588-A (Saltman) have been found to meet these requirements. 
This patent application describes elastomeric thermoplastic polymers 
prepared by meltgrafting three components: an engineering thermoplastic 
(e.g. nylon, polyester, copolyester ether, copolyester ester, or polycarbonate), 
an ionomer, and a polymeric grafting agent. In particular, this patent 
application describes polymer alloys which comprise, in general: 
a) 25-50% volumeof at least one thermoplastic resin;  
 b) 10-74% volumeof at least one ethylene copolymer E/X/Y where 
E is > 50%wt ethylene X is 1-35%wt of an acid-containing 
unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and 
Y is 0-49%wt of a moiety derived from at least 
one alkyl acrylate, alkylmethacrylate, vinyl ether, 
carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, or mixtures 
thereof, where the alkyl and ether radicals 
contain 1-12 carbon atoms and further wherein 
the acid groups in the acid-containing moiety are 
neutralized from 0-100% by a metal ion; c) 1-50% volumeof at least one polymeric grafting agent which 
contains reactive groups selected from at least 
one of epoxides, isocyanates, aziridine silanes, 
alkylating agents, that react with the acid-containing 
moieties in component b) and that 
additionally react with the reactive graft sites of 
component a). The aforesaid EP-290 588-A describes various
