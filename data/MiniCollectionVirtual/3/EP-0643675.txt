<DESCRIPTION>
 INHIBITING THE GROWTH OF ZEBRA MUSSELSTechnical FieldThis invention relates to the inhibition of the growth of zebra mussels (Dreissena Polymorpha) which have recently infested the Great Lakes and nearby rivers and other waters. It involves the use of certain thermosetting materials as structural or surface materials in areas where the zebra mussels are not desired. The areas of concern can be either stationary, such as piers, power plant cooling water intakes, and the like, or moving, such as boat hulls or buoys. The thermosetting materials are unsaturated polyesters copolymerized with N-phenyl maleimide or N-cyclohexyl maleimide.Background of the InventionZebra mussels were first discovered in American waters in Lake St. Clair in 1988, ["Infestation of the Monroe Power Plant by the Zebra Mussel (Dreissena Polymorpha)", Kovalack, W.P., Longton, G.D., Smithee, R.D., Proceedings of the American Power Conference, Chicago, 111., 1990]. It is believed that the mussel larvae were dumped into the water with a European or Western Asian ship's ballast water in 1985. The mussels have spread quickly throughout the Great Lakes Basin and are reasonably expected to infest waterways in most of 

the United States including Florida but excluding most of the other Southern and Southwestern states and to infest most of southern Canada. They have spread throughout most of Europe with the exception of northern Scandinavia, the Iberian Peninsula and Italy. They are also in western Asia where they originally inhabited the Ural River and Caspian Sea but now cover almost all of Russia, extending into Turkey ["Impact of the European Zebra Mussel Infestation to the Electric Power Industry", McMahon, R.F., Tsou, J.L., Proceedings of the American Power Conference, Chicago, 111., 1990].Zebra mussels float through the waters in a free swimming planktonic veliger state. They attach to any hard surface with byssal threads. The byssus contains up to 200 threads which are difficult to remove from a surface even after death. They may attach to other mussel shells and form large clumps of mussels which threaten to block intake lines of raw water supplying power plants and municipal water authorities ["Control of Zebra Mussels at CEI Facilities", Barton, L.K., Proceedings of the American Power Conference, Chicago, 111., 1990].Workers in the art have attempted to control macroinvertebrates generally by dissolving into the environment of the target organisms various amines and/or quaternaries.

<CLAIMS>
 Claims
1. Method of inhibiting the growth of zebra mussels on a surface comprising utilizing as said surface a cured resin composition comprising about 5-89% unsaturated polyester, about 1-40% of an N-cyclic maleimide, up to about 20% methacrylic acid or a lower alkyl ester thereof, and about 10-40% of a polymerizable monomer.
2. Method of claim 1 wherein the N-cyclic maleimide is N-phenylmaleimide.
3. Method of claim 1 wherein the polymerizable monomer is styrene.
