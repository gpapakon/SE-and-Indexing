<ABSTRACT>
Clamping and shaping jaws (14) are to provide a multi-purpose tool which can rapidly be adapted to the various purposes and with which not only high clamping but also shaping forces can be applied when necessary. This is achieved in that the tool jaws (14) are guided by guide components (15) in the basic body (2) or slide (3) which are essentially directed in the direction of closing, the tool jaws (14) are held in their operative position by a centric clamping component (16, 17, 19) and, besides the spindle drive (5-7) there is a further pedal (12a)-operated mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic and/or electric-motor-operated closing member (12) to move the slide (3) in relation to the basic body (2).

A clamping and deforming tool (1) having tool jaws (14) which 
are movable relative to each other in the inner of a vice by way of a 

spindle drive (5, 6) and which are fixed interchangeably to a stationary 
main body (2) on the one hand and a movable slider (3) on the other 

hand, wherein besides the spindle drive (5-7) for moving the slider (3) 
relative to the main body (2) there is provided at least one further 

mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic and/or electric-motor feed element (12) 
which can be operated by way of a pedal (12a), characterised in that the 

tool jaws (14) are guided in the main body (2) and the slider (3) 
respectively with guide elements (15) which are oriented substantially 

in the feed direction, wherein the tool jaws (14) are each substantially 
L-shaped at their contact in the main body (2) and in the slider (3) and 

are each positively lockingly arranged in the main body (2) and the 
slider (3) respectively and that the tool jaws (14) are held in their 

working position by means of a central clamping element (16, 17, 19) 
wherein provided in the main body (2) and the slider (3) are pins (15) 

corresponding to openings in the tool jaws, and that as the central 
clamping element a hook-shaped, spring-loaded and selectively 

displaceable pulling portion (16, 17) engages into an engagement groove 
on the tool jaws (14). 
A clamping and deforming tool according to claim 1 
characterised in that the pulling portion is provided with a head (16) 

engaging into the opening in the respective tool jaw (14) and with a pin 
(16a) which is operatively connected to a push button (18) which 

projects beyond the outside contour of the main body or the slider 
respectively. 
A clamping and deforming tool according to one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the pin (16a) passes at least in 

a region-wise manner through a spring-loaded nut (17), by bans of which 
the biasing of the spring (19) is adjustable.  

 
A clamping and deforming tool according to one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the push button (18) is provided 

with an internal bore for actuation of the biasing nut (17). 
A clamping and deforming tool according to one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the push button (18) is prevented 

from rotating by bans of a pin (21) engaging into a longitudinal slot 
and/or the nut (17) is provided with a screw slot or a hexagonal recess 

for actuation purposes. 
A clamping and deforming tool according to claim 1 or one of 
the following claims characterised in that for applying a deformation 

force a per se known foot-actuable linkage (12) is provided for 
actuating the slider (3). 
A clamping and deforming tool according to one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the actuating linkage (12) passes 

through the main body (2) in a plane in front of the stationary tool jaw 
and engages with an engagement projection (10) or fork into an annular 

groove (9) in a spindle sleeve (7).
