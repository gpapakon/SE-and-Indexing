<ABSTRACT>
The erodability of drilling fluid deposits and the 
shear stress required to remove drilling fluid deposits 

formed on the walls of a well bore are measured by 
introducing a drilling fluid into a test apparatus (20) 

which includes a permeable section (24,26) to simulate a 
permeable section of a well bore. Drilling fluid deposits 

are caused to be formed on the walls of the permeable 
section (24,26), and the drilling fluid is circulated 

through the permeable section (24,26) at progressively 
increasing flow rates to determine the pressure drop below 

which no appreciable erosion of the drilling fluid deposits 
takes place, which corresponds to the minimum shear stress 

required to erode the deposits. The erodability of the 
drilling fluid which is inversely proportional to the 

minimum shear stress, can also be determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to measurement of 
the shear stress required to remove drilling fluid deposits 
from the walls of well bores, and of the erodability factors 
for drilling fluids. In the drilling of an oil and/or gas well, a rotary drill 
bit connected to a string of drill pipe is most commonly used. 
The drill pipe and drill bit are rotated, and a weighted 
gelled drilling fluid, e.g. an aqueous clay containing fluid 
having particulate weighting material suspended therein, is 
circulated through the well bore to lift cuttings produced by 
the drill bit to the surface and to maintain hydrostatic 
pressure in the well bore whereby pressurized fluids contained 
in penetrated subterranean formations are prevented from 
entering the well bore. The circulation of the drilling fluid 
is accomplished by pumping the drilling fluid downwardly 
through the drill pipe, through ports in the drill bit and 
then upwardly in the annulus between the drill pipe and the 
walls of the well bore. When the drilling of the well bore is completed, the 
circulation of the drilling fluid is stopped while the drill  
 
pipe and drill bit are withdrawn, the well is logged and pipe, 
e.g., casing, is run into the well bore. During this shutdown 
period, significant quantities of filter cake and partially 
dehydrated gelled drilling fluid are often deposited on the 
walls of the well bore as a result of the drilling fluid 
remaining static in the well bore and the occurrence of fluid 
loss from the drilling fluid into permeable subterranean 
formations penetrated by the well bore. The filter cake is 
principally comprised of particulate weighting material and 
other solids, and the partially dehydrated gelled drilling 
fluid is formed from drilling fluid adjacent the walls of the 
well bore which develops gel strength in the absence of shear 
and loses a portion of its water as a result of the fluid 
loss. Also, the remaining drilling fluid in both the pipe and 
annulus develops gel strength in the absence of shear during 
the drilling fluid circulation shutdown. After pipe is run into the well bore, primary cementing 
operations are performed therein. That is, the pipe is 
cemented in the well bore by placing a cement slurry in the 
annulus between the pipe and the walls of the well bore. The 
cement slurry sets into a hard impermeable mass whereby the 
pipe is bonded to the walls of the well bore and the annulus 
is sealed. When the cement slurry is run into the annulus, 
drilling fluid is displaced from the well
