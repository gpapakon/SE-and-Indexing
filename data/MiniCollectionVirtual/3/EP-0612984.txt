<ABSTRACT>
A new procedure for a precise weighing of powder materials 
on air conveying packing machines is proposed. It is 

achieved by a precise material dosage in the final weighing 
stage (ca. 5% of the end quantity). The design is based on 

the final dosage carried out within the preset time limits 
(ca. 20% of the total dosage time). By controlling the final 

dosage time, and by the preset material quantity, the powder 
flow (kg/s) for weighing (ca.20% of the maximal value) has 

been determined. This prevents the weighing to be finished 
by an excessive powder flow onto the balance. The weighing 

completion is controlled resulting in a high accuracy level, 
wherein the corrections are made automatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for a precise
weighing of powder materials on air conveying packing
machines with a fluidization of the material in a bulk
storage from which the material is packed in at least two
stages with different quantities of flow of the material.The standard powder weighing procedure on air conveying
packing machines is normally carried out in two filling
stages: rough and fine.A procedure for a precise weighing of powder materials can be
gathered from EP-A 0 221 367, for example. With this known
procedure an opening of a metering means is predefined and a
further parameter can be varied according to the weight
increase during a period of time, wherein two filling stages
are provided.Another weighing system with at least two filling stages can
be taken from DE-A 30 26 084, wherein the weighing means
comprises vibrating strings being differently charged during
the filling procedure. This known system aims particularly at
allowing a precise weighing without any dependency on temperature
and reduced influence of mechanical vibrations.From DE-A 29 49 298 there has become known a valve means for
a weighing means aiming at a simplified construction of such
valve means.Another two-stage procedure for a precise weighing is known
from FR-A 2 413 297, wherein a filling can be achieved by
conveying material from different stocks.The machine operation procedure, for example flow of the
powder material, per each stage is adjusted manually by the
operator depending on the kind of powder. Powder properties
variations during operation (pourability - ISO 6186) normally
adversely affect the weighing accuracy. It is an object of the present invention to develop a new,
improved weighing procedure of powder materials for air
conveying packing machines with highly accurate material
dosage in the final weighing stage.It is a further object of the present invention to define a
new procedure of final powder dosage for weighing at air
conveying packing machines with high weighing accuracy.Further the problem of powder property variations (pourability
- ISO 6186) during operation adversely affecting the
weighing accuracy requires a new technical solution.These objects are achieved by a procedure for a precise
weighing of powder materials on air conveying packing machines
with a fluidization of the material in a bulk storage
from which the material is packed in at least two filling
stages with different quantities of flow of the material,
comprising the following steps:
rapid or rough filling

Procedure for a precise weighing of powder materials (P)
on air conveying packing machines with a fluidization of the

material in a bulk storage (SP) from which the material (P)
is packed in at least two filling stages with different

quantities of flow of the material (P), comprising the
following steps:


rapid or rough filling of the powder material (P) until
about 85 % of the preset weight, determined by weighing, is

reached,
fine filling with a reduced flow of material (P) until
about 95 % of the preset weight, determined by weighing, is

reached,
final filling with reduced flow of material (P) for a
preset period of time or a period of time calculated in a

previous filling and weighing cycle, and
calculating from the time necessary for the final filling
step a period of time for the final weighing step for

reaching the preset weight for a further weighing and filling
cycle.
Procedure for a precise weighing of powder materials (8)
on air conveying packing machines according to claim 1,

wherein the supply of the material (P) is controlled by

presetting the quantity and time in the final dosage stage in
a way that the pulse/permutation fluidization air (FS)

loosens the powder material (P) through nozzels (S), which
material is then conveyed via a dosage valve (d) into a bag

(V) placed on a balance (a), the shift of which is detected
by a pneumatic measuring cell (M) controlled by an orifice

(PR) and to which pressure switches (PS-1, PS-2, PS-3) are
connected, characterized in that a reducing valve (RV-2) sets

the desired 100 % weighing value read at a meter (b) and an
electric signal (START) actuates a solenoid valve (EPR-1)

which 100% opens the dosage valve (d) via a further reducing
valve (RV-1) for achieving the rapid filling until 85 %

weighing value is achieved, whereafter a pressure switch (PS-1) 
is actuated releasing a first solenoid valve (EPR-1),

which pneumatic signal is transmitted to the dosage valve (d)
via a second solenoid valve (EPR-2), a third solenoid valve

(EPR-3) and a third reducing valve (RV-3); in that the
reducing valve (RV-3) sets the opening of the dosage valve

(d) at 50 % for achieving the five filling until a weighing
value of 95 % is achieved, when the second pressure switch

(PS-2) is actuated switching on the third solenoid valve
(EPR-3) and an electronic block (EB), which controls the

final filling stage via an electro-pneumatic converter (I/P),
which controls the dosage valve (d) via the solenoid valves

(EPR-3, EPR-2 and EPR-1) until the 100 % weighing value is
achieved, whereafter the pressure switch (PS-3) is actuated

switching off a weighing cycle.
Procedure for the precise weighing of powder materials on
air conveying packing machines according to claim 2, characterized

in that the electronic block (EB) processes the
electric signal from the pressure switch (PS-2) brought to

the input (D) of a first unit (1) measuring the final dosage
time within time limits (Δt) preset by a first potentiometer

(A) and a second potentiometer (B), in that the output
signals activate a second unit (2), which determines the

direction and value of a current correction (ΔI) selected by
a third potentimeter (C), whose output signal activates a

third unit (3) which converts it into an analogue-current
signal controlling the dosage valve (d).
Procedure for the precise weighing of powder materials on
air conveying packing machines according to claim 2 or 3,

characterized in that the pneumatic components are at least
partly replaced by electric and/or electronic components.
Procedure for the precise weighing of powder materials on
air conveying packing machines according to any of the claims

1 to 4, characterized in that the powder materials to be
packed and weighed are resins.
