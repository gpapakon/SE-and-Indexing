<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming micro-trench isolation regions with a separation 
of 0.20µm to 0.35µm in the fabrication of semiconductor devices involves 

forming an silicon dioxide layer on select locations of a semiconductor 
substrate and depositing a polysilicon layer onto the silicon dioxide layer. A 

layer of photoresist is then deposited over select areas of the polysilicon layer 
and patterned to form micro-trench isolation regions of widths between about 

0.2µm to about 0.5µm and aspect ratio of between about 2:1 to about 7:1. 
Thereafter, the isolation regions are etched for a time and pressure sufficient 

to form micro-trenches in the substrate surface. The micro-trenches will 
generally have a width ranging from about 1000Å to about 3500Å and depth 

ranging from about 500Å to about 5000Å. The layer of photoresist is then 
removed to expose the polysilicon layer and a channel stop implant is 

deposited and aligned with the micro-trenches. A thermal silicon dioxide layer 
is formed in the micro-trenches and an undoped silicon dioxide layer is 

deposited onto the polysilicon layer to fill the micro-trenches. A planar silicon 
dioxide layer is then deposited onto the undoped silicon dioxide layer and the 

undoped and planar silicon dioxide layers are then etched back to expose the 
polysilicon layer. After etchback, the polysilicon layer is stripped to provide 

the micro-trench isolation regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to manufacturing semiconductor 
devices, and more particularly to methods of forming micro-trench isolation 
regions in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. Many electronic integrated circuits are formed by a strategic placement 
and interconnection of selected electronic devices, such as transistors and the 
like, within a semiconductor substrate. The electronic devices are 
interconnected using an array of surface conductors carrying data signals 
through which the devices communicate. The electronic devices, however, 
must be sufficiently isolated from one another so that the signals in each  
 
respective electronic device do not interfere with and degrade the others' signal 
quality. Device isolation is typically achieved using local oxidation of silicon 
("LOCOS") or shallow trench isolation ("STI"). In these device isolation 
techniques, isolation is commonly provided by forming a recess or trench 
between two active areas, upon which the electronic devices are located, and 
filling the trench with an isolation material. In either shallow trench isolation 
processes or local oxidation of silicon isolation techniques, the isolation for 
devices is typically spaced at 0.5µm or greater and a physical delta-ω 
(difference between the drawn active area width and actual active area width) 
of 0.30µm or greater. There is a need in the industry for a technique to allow fabrication of 
channel devices with denser packing, and thus separated by narrower isolation 
regions. The present inventive process provides a means to form device 
isolation trenches separated by about 0.10µm to about 0.35µm, about one-half 
the distance available with current technology. Further, the process yields a 
small physical delta-ω of less than about 0.1µm. This process is a 
modification of conventional processing and does not require advanced 
photolithography or plasma etch equipment. Thus, there is a significant cost 
benefit to employing the inventive technology, since other techniques to 
achieve similar results would require extensive and costly capital 
improvement. The present inventive process takes advantage of the 
characteristics of micro-trenching by incorporating them into isolation 
trenches. When the present inventive process is used in conjunction with  
 
standard techniques, such as STI, a device can be fabricated with variable 
trench width and variable distances between the trenches. The present invention provides a method of forming closely spaced 
micro-trench
