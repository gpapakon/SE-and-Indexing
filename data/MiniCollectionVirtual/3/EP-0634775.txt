<ABSTRACT>
A color cathode-ray tube comprises an envelope (5) 
having rectangular flat face and rear plates (1, 3) 

opposing each other. A phosphor screen is formed on an 
inner surface of the face plate. Mask support members 

(10) are mounted on an inner surface of the rear plate. 
A shadow mask (9) is arranged in the envelope and supported 

by the mask support members to face the phosphor 
screen at a predetermined distance. A plurality of 

positioning posts (15) are fixed on the inner surface of 
the rear plate and extend toward the face plate. A plurality 

of positioning pins (17) extend from the inner 
surface of the face plate and engage the positioning 

posts so as to position the face plate at a predetermined 
position with respect to the rear plate. The 

shadow mask has setting openings (9a) through which the 
positioning posts extend so as to position the shadow 

mask at a predetermined position with respect to the 
rear plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color cathode-ray
tube in which a phosphor screen is formed on the
inner surface of a flat face plate, and a method of
manufacturing the same.Recently, various researches have been made on
high-definition broadcasting and a high-resolution
cathode-ray tube with a large screen designed for the
high-definition broadcasting. In general, in order to
achieve high resolution of a cathode-ray tube, the spot
diameter of an electron beam on a phosphor screen must
be reduced.For this purpose, in the prior art, the structure
of an electrode of an electron gun has been improved, or
the caliber and/or length of the electron gun has been
increased. However, satisfactory achievement has not
been obtained. The main reason is that the distance
between the electron gun and the phosphor screen
increases in accordance with the increase in size of the
tube and the magnification of the electron lens
increases excessively. Accordingly, in order to achieve
high resolution, it is important to shorten the distance
(depth) between the electron gun and the phosphor
screen. In addition, when the wide-angle deflection is
used, the difference in magnification between the center
area and peripheral area of the phosphor screen
increases. Thus, the wide-angle deflection is not 
advantageous for achieving high resolution.Under the circumstances, in the prior art, Jpn.
Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 48-90428 discloses a
method of arranging a plurality of independent small-sized
cathode-ray tubes, thereby constituting a high-resolution,
large screen. This kind of method is
effective for large-scale screen display with a large
number of divided regions, which is designed for outdoor
installation. However, when this method is applied to
middle-scale screen display (e.g., the screen size is
about 100 cm (40 inches)), connection portions between the
divided regions of the screen are conspicuous, resulting
in low-quality images. Thus, when the display formed by
this method is used a household Tv receiver or computer-aided
design (CAD), the connection portions on the
screen are a serious defect.On the other hand, U.S. Patent No. 3,071,706 or the
like discloses a structure wherein phosphor screens of a
plurality of independent cathode-ray tubes are
integrated. In this cathode-ray tube having the integrated
phosphor screen, a vacuum envelope is constituted
by a face plate on which a phosphor screen is coated, a
rear plate opposed and arranged to the face plate, and a
plurality of funnels adjacent to the rear
