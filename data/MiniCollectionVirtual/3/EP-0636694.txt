<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of thymopoietin. More 
particularly, the invention relates to methods for producing human or 
human-like thymopoietin, and to means for such production. Thymopoietin (TP) is a hormone-like material which is believed to be of 
importance in a variety of biological processes. TP is a humoral factor 
secreted by the thymus. Other thymic factors have been isolated, mostly 
from calf thymuses, through extraction and purification procedures. 
Several peptides which are unrelated in amino acid content and 
sequence have been completely purified and sequenced, and include, 
besides thymopoietin, also thymulin, THF and several thymosin 
peptides. TP plays a major role in enhancing T-cells maturation and activation. 
TP is known to have an important influence on the immune system, and 
in particular it appears to have beneficial clinical effects in conditions of 
immunodeficiency, cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmuno 
disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis. For this reason, many efforts 
have been made in the art to provide thymopoietin, which so far have 
had only limited success, because the preparation of full length TP by 
extraction and purification, or by synthesis, is impractical and cannot be  
 
used for routine preparation of this compound for medical uses, and 
because the hTP sequence was not known. It is also known that a short peptide synthesized on the basis of a known 
sequence, the 32-36 amino acid sequence of bovine TP contains the active 
site of thymopoietin. This peptide, called thymopentin, is however 
instable, exhibiting an extremely short half-life in vitro, and cannot be 
used as such for this reason. It appears that the whole thymopoietin 
peptide is needed in order to impart stability to the thymopentin active 
fragment. Bovine thymopoietin has been cloned as described in European Patent 
Application No. 92300671.2. This application discloses the nucleotide 
sequence encoding the 18 to 49 amino acids of bovine thymopoietin. 
However, bovine thymopoietin differs from human thymopoietin, as 
more fully discussed below. This difference renders undesirable the use 
of bovine thymopoietin as a therapeutical agent in humans, because of 
the expected adverse immune response of the human body to it. Audhya et al. published in 1987 an article entitled "Isolation and 
complete amino acid sequence of human thymopoietin and splenin" 
[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 84, pp. 3545-3549, June 1987], in which 
the amino acid sequences of the
