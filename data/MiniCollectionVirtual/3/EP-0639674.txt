<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a homogeneous solid rubber vehicular barrier, 

comprising the steps of: mixing and knead melting a mixture 
of: 80 to 90 percent by weight particles of recycled waste 

rubber; 10 to 20 percent by weight virgin rubber; and an 
accelerator composition; forming the mixture in a mould to a 

selected barrier configuration thus forming a barrier; 
curing the mixture within the mould at a temperature of 250 

to 450 C° at a pressure of 500 to 1000 psi for a period of 
time from 1.5 to 7.5 hours; and removing the cured barrier 

from the mould. A homogeneous moulded solid rubber 
vehicular barrier, is thereby formed of 80 to 90 percent by 

weight particles of recycled waste rubber in a matrix of 10 
to 20 percent by weight virgin rubber. The completed 

barrier has a finished outer surface of cured uncontaminated 

rubber, and has a Shore hardness of between 65 and 70.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rubber vehicular impact 
barrier, for use as highway median or curb barriers for 
example, and particularly a solid rubber barrier constructed 
containing 80-90 percent recycled waste rubber. Highways and racetracks are often constructed with 
temporary or permanent barriers to contain and direct 
vehicles that have lost control. Conventionally the 
barriers are massive concrete walls which are either formed 
in place or are prefabricated in interlocking modules. The 
modules may be prefabricated in a concrete manufacturing 
facility and transported to the erection site to be lifted 
into place with cranes or forklift trucks. An advantage of modular systems is that they can 
be used during highway construction to protect workers and 
equipment on a temporary basis, as well as in permanent 
installations. When the barriers are no longer required the 
modules may be reused in other locations. When a module is 
damaged it can be easily removed and replaced. Typically conventional highway barrier modules 
include means to interconnect modules in a longitudinal 
series. One preferred conventional interconnecting means is 
a vertical tongue and groove however mechanical connections, 
such as bolts, are also used in permanent installations. The size and weight of conventional barrier 
modules is such that they may be placed directly upon paved 
surfaces and do not require any anchoring to the surface in 
order to resist lateral impact loads from vehicles. The 
weight of the modules, interconnected with other like 
modules, provides inertial resistance and frictional 
resistance to sliding on their bases, thus preventing 
vehicles from crashing through the barriers into adjacent 
lanes of traffic or into highway ditches.  
 The use of concrete barrier modules is fairly 
widespread since they are durable and relatively inexpensive 
to construct. Abrasion between an impacting metallic 
vehicles creates sparks which often ignites the fuel of the 
vehicle which is spilled upon impact with the barrier. The 
danger of sparks is particularly significant due to the 
increased use of propane and natural gas as a fuel for 
vehicles. In the future it is also very likely that 
explosive hydrogen gas will be used to fuel significant 
numbers of vehicles. A vehicle which looses control and crashes into a 
concrete barrier therefore may leak significant amounts of 
fuel. The vehicle may be abraded against the concrete 
barrier for an appreciable distance thereby creating sparks 
which may ignite the
