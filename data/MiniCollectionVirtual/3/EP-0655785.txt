<ABSTRACT>
A select MOS transistor (ST) and a data storage MOS 
transistor (MT) are formed in an element region. The 

transistor (MT) has floating-gate electrodes (71A, 71B). 
The floating-gate electrodes (71A, 71B) are spaced apart 

above the element region and connected to each other 
above a field region. Only a tunnel insulating film 

(66) much thinner than a gate insulating film (68) of 
the transistor (ST) is placed between the floating-gate 

electrode (71A) and a drain region (63). Only the 
gate insulating film (66) much thinner than the gate 

insulating film of the transistor (ST) is placed between 
the floating-gate electrode (71B) and the channel region 

of the transistor (MT). In the element region, the 
shape of a control electrode (75) is the same as that of 

the floating-gate electrodes (71A, 71B).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nonvolatile semiconductor
memory device capable of electrically rewriting data
and semipermanently retaining data.Nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices using
double-gate MOS transistors with a floating gate and a
control gate are well known.A conventional nonvolatile semiconductor memory
device will be explained with reference to FIGS. 1 to
10.FIGS. 1 and 2 show a first structure of a conventional
nonvolatile semiconductor memory device.The nonvolatile semiconductor memory device is of
the most widely used type. FIG. 1 is a plan view of a
memory cell in the nonvolatile semiconductor memory
device. FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken along line
II-II' of FIG. 1.The memory cell is composed of a data storage MOS
transistor MT and a select MOS transistor ST, which are
connected to each other in series.The source region of the select MOS transistor ST
and the drain region of the data storage MOS transistor
MT are made up of n-type regions 12 and 13 at the
surface of a p-type semiconductor substrate 10,
respectively.On a partial surface of the n-type region, a very
thin silicon oxide film 17 of nearly 10 nm in thickness 
is formed. A floating-gate electrode 19 and a control
gate electrode 20 are formed on and above the channel
region 22 of the data storage MOS transistor MT and the
silicon oxide film 17. The floating-gate electrode 19
and control gate electrode 20 are made of polysilicon,
for example.In a place directly under the floating-gate
electrode 19 where the silicon oxide film 17 has not
been formed, and directly under the gate electrode 18 of
the select MOS transistor ST, silicon oxide films 23,
16 (of several tens nm) several times as thick as the
silicon oxide film 17 are formed.The drain region of the select MOS transistor ST
is composed of n-type regions 11, 12', and the source
region of the data storage MOS transistor MT is made up
of n-type regions 14, 15.With the memory cell of such a configuration, the
erasing of data is effected by applying a high potential
to the control gate electrode 20 of the data storage
MOS transistor MT. Specifically, once a high potential
has been applied to the control gate electrode 20,
Fowler-Nordheim tunneling allows electrons to move from
the n-type region (drain region) 13 via the silicon
oxide film 17 to the floating-gate electrode 19.The writing of data is performed by applying a high
potential to the n-type region (drain region) 11 and the
gate electrode 18 of the select MOS transistor ST, and
0V to the control gate electrode 20
