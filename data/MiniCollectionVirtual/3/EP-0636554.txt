<ABSTRACT>
A carton (11) of the top gripping type packaging a plurality of 
articles (A) comprising a number of apertures (60) which receive 

the tops of articles (A) and which are adapted to engage the 
underside of a flange F of the article (A). The carton (11) 

further comprises locking means (50) which can act to retain at 
least one article (A) and can also act to provide rigidity to the 

carton (11) by substantially fixing the relative positions of a 
top panel (28) and bottom panel (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a carton which is used for
packaging a plurality of articles such as bottles. More
particularly, it relates to a carton of the top gripping
type which attaches to the tops of articles thereby to
secure the articles in an array.It is known to provide so-called top-gripping cartons which
comprise so-called sunburst type apertures having a series
of circumferentially arranged tabs which enable a bottle
top to pass through the aperture which the tabs engage on
the underside of the bottle top or on a flange on the
bottle neck to prevent removal of the bottle from the
aperture. Such sunburst aperture arrays require to be
spaced apart on a panel, normally the top panel of the
carton. Cartons of this general type are shown for example
in EP188327A2 and GB154197B.Another type of top-gripping carton is disclosed in EP42720
wherein a relatively rigid collar is provided around a
series of bottles. The carton comprises apertures which
each have a peripheral edge which engages the underside of
opposite sides of a flange which protrudes from a bottle
neck thereby to retain the bottle. Such cartons generally 
accommodate a single row of articles and involve a relatively intricate folding process
to form both the carton and engage the articles.None of the prior art is concerned with a carton of the top gripping type for use with
containers such as bottles wherein the bottle tops have a radius which approaches that
of the radius of the body of the bottle. Such articles are provided, for example, to
contain dairy products such as yoghurt and can be made from plastics wherein a
plastics cap closes a wide neck opening and has a plastics pull-off safety ring. The
pull tab of such a safety ring can protrude to the same radial extent as the radius of the
plastics bottle. Such bottles are grouped so that a space is left between adjacent
bottles if a carton of the known type comprising sunburst apertures is to be used. This
has the disadvantage that the overall carton is not packaged as tightly thereby creating
the risk of damage to the containers and/or accidental displacement of a container
from the carton.One aspect of the present invention provides a carton of the top-gripping type
accommodating a plurality of articles, for example bottles, comprises a first panel and
apertures for receiving the top of the articles which apertures are struck from said first
panel and comprise a first edge which engages the underside of a radially protruding
part of an article present in the aperture and a second edge

<CLAIMS>
A carton of the top-gripping type accommodating a plurality of articles, for
example bottles, comprises a first panel (20), and apertures (60) for receiving the

tops of the articles which apertures (60) are struck from said first panel (20) and each comprise
a first edge (64) which engages the underside of a radially protruding part (F) of an

article (A) present in the aperture (60) and a second edge , which edge abuts a wall of
the article, characterised in that the second edge is substantially oppose
d to said first
edge (64) and axially above said first edge (64) thereby to restrict article (A) removal

from said aperture (60).
A carton according to claim 1 wherein the first panel (20) comprises a
marginal panel (18) hingably attached thereto and wherein said first edge (64) extends

into the marginal panel (18) such that the first edge (64) is provided by the marginal
panel (18), the carton thereby being adapted to engage an article top when the

marginal panel (18) is displaced from the first panel (20) by folding about a hinge line
(36).
A carton according to claim 1 or claim 2 further comprising a series of
hingably interconnected side panels (14, 26) and a top (12, 28) and locking means

(50) provided by the first panel (20) which is adapted to restrict relative movement of
the panels in the formed carton. 
A carton according to claim 3 wherein said locking means (50) comprises a
tab having an upstanding portion (54) adjacent a peripheral wall portion of one bottle

of a pair and a further portion (56) overlying the top of the adjacent bottle of that pair
said further portion (56) being secured to the top (28) of the carton.
A carton according to claim 3 wherein the locking means (170) comprises a
locking tab (172) which cooperates with a locking aperture (180) having a peripheral

rim in one of said panels (120).
A carton according to claim 5 wherein said locking tab (172) is provided along
the longitudinal marginal portion of a panel (112) which is disposed intermediate the

first panel (120) and the top (128) and said locking aperture (160) is struck from the
first panel (120).
A carton blank for forming a carton of the top gripping type in line with claims 1 - 6
comprises a bottom wall (16, 12, 20, 22, 24), a top wall (12, 28) and a side wall (14, 26) which are

hinged together in series wherein article receiving apertures (60) are provided at least
in part in a panel (20) which is to form the base of the carton,

characterised by each
aperture (60) being

defined by a first edge (64) adapted to engage a flange (F) on the neck of an article and
wherein a second edge of the aperture (60) is adapted to engage a peripheral wall of

the top of the article.
A blank according to claim 7 comprising locking means (50) having a tab
struck from the aperture (60) and has a first portion (54) for disposition against a 

peripheral wall portion of said article and a further portion (56) hinged to said first
portion (54) adapted to overlie the top of another article present in an adjacent

aperture.
A blank according to claim 7 comprising locking means (170) having a
locking tab (172) which cooperates with a locking aperture (180) having a peripheral

rim in one of said walls (120).
