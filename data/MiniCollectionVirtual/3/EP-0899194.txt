<ABSTRACT>
At its outlet end, where the products are delivered in bulk, the machine is equipped with a tray (1) with a series of corridors running in one direction, in which the products are aligned in rows, and two stepped conveyors (2,3) running perpendicular to the tray, carrying containers to be filled with the products. The two stepped conveyors are linked by a linear conveyor (4), and the filled containers are transferred by a second linear conveyor (5) to a bagging machine.
