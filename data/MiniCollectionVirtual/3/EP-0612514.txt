<ABSTRACT>
A clear shampoo is described which contains a 
nonionic oil-in-water emulsion of a trimethylsilyl endblocked 

amine functional polydimethyl silicone. In the method of 
making clear and stable shampoo compositions, an emulsion of 

an amine functional siloxane is added to the shampoo 
composition without causing cloudiness and without 

contributing instability to the shampoo composition whereby 
phase separation occurs. In accordance with the method, an 

emulsion of an amine functional siloxane is added to a 
shampoo composition without the necessity of requiring that a 

pearling agent be employed for the purpose of disguising 
cloudiness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a clear shampoo and 
to clear shampoo products which contain a nonionic oil-in-water 
emulsion of an amine functional polydimethyl silicone. Silicone containing nonionic emulsions have been 
traditionally known in the hair care art to tend towards the 
formation of surface creams, curds and separated oils, in 
anionic detergent systems such as shampoo products. Because 
of the positively charged nature of the silicone polymer at 
normal pH, such emulsions have not generally been compatible 
with anionic surfactants. These emulsions are particularly 
prone to form a surface cream when mixed into anionic 
detergent systems, resulting in unstable, unusable products. The silicone containing nonionic emulsion is an 
excellent shampoo ingredient from the standpoint of being 
very substantive to hair and bringing about a dramatic 
improvement in both wet and dry combing. It is also 
effective in reducing water retention in hair which leads to 
shorter drying times. It is further capable of providing 
conditioning, such as improved luster and resistance to dry 
fly-away. Yet, formulators have heretofore marketed products 
which contain the nonionic emulsion in a form which contains 
a pearling agent, in order to mask any turbidity in the 
product. A problem, therefore, exists in the personal care 
arena for clear shampoos containing nonionic silicone 
emulsions, which can be formulated into products without the 
necessity for masking or disguising otherwise turbid products 
or products having high cloud points.  This invention introduces a method of making clear 
and stable shampoo compositions in which an emulsion of an 
amine functional siloxane can be added to a shampoo 
composition without causing cloudiness and without 
contributing instability to the shampoo composition whereby 
phase separation occurs. The invention further provides clear and stable 
shampoo compositions without the necessity of a pearling 
agent for the purpose of disguising the presence of 
cloudiness. The conditioning agent which is used as a shampoo 
additive in the present invention, is a trimethylsilyl 
endblocked amine substituted siloxane polymer that is 
stabilized in the form of an aqueous emulsion by means of a 
nonionic surfactant. The siloxane polymer is represented by 
the formula: 
in which x and y are integers having positive values which 
control the molecular weight of the polymer. Typically, the 
integer x has a value of from one to ten thousand and the 
integer y has a value of from one

A method of making a clear shampoo composition 
containing a silicone nonionic emulsion comprising the steps 

of (i) forming an aqueous solution of an anionic surfactant, 
the anionic surfactant being present in an amount of from 3 

to 30 percent by weight on a solids basis, based on the total 
weight of the clear shampoo composition; (ii) adding to the 

aqueous solution at a temperature of from 5 to 30°C. from 
0.25 to 25 percent by weight based on the total weight of the 

clear shampoo composition of a silicone containing nonionic 
emulsion which is a trimethylsilyl endblocked amine 

substituted siloxane polymer stabilized in the form of an 
aqueous emulsion by means of at least two nonionic 

surfactants, the siloxane polymer being present in the 
nonionic emulsion in the form of particles having a diameter 

of at least about two hundred nanometers; (iii) mixing the 
solution containing the nonionic emulsion at a rate 

sufficient to disperse the siloxane polymer, but at a rate 
less than that which would cause the solution to foam or 

become aerated; (iv) adjusting the pH of the solution to a 
value of from 4 to 7; (v) and adding an electrolyte to the 

solution in an amount sufficient to provide a shampoo 
composition having a viscosity of from 500 to 15,000 mm²/s 

(centistokes); the total water content of the clear shampoo 
composition being from 50 to 97 percent by weight; steps (i) 

to (v) being carried out at temperatures of 35°C. or less. 
A method according to claim 1 in which the 
electrolyte is a compound selected from the group consisting 

of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride. 
A clear shampoo composition prepared in 
accordance with the method defined in claim 1. 
A method of shampooing and conditioning hair 
comprising the steps of applying the clear shampoo 

composition defined in claim 1 to hair, rubbing the clear 
shampoo composition into the hair and removing the 

composition from the hair by rinsing the hair with water. 
A method of making a clear shampoo composition 
containing a silicone nonionic emulsion comprising the steps 

of (i) forming an aqueous solution of an anionic surfactant, 
the anionic surfactant being present in an amount of from 3
