<ABSTRACT>
An applicator for dosing a pumpable food material 
comprising a dosing means and a three-way valve formed from 

a valve house and a valve tap, the valve house having an 
inlet opening through which the pumpable food material may 

be supplied to the valve, a dosing opening through which 
the pumpable food material may be dosed and an outlet 

opening through which the pumpable food material may be 
deposited from the valve, the valve tap being adapted to 

reciprocate to open alternately the inlet and dosing 
openings together and the outlet and dosing openings 

together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an applicator for dosing 
pumpable food materials. 
The documents FR-A-2 671 398 and EP-A-0 003 394 disclose 
applicators known in the prior art. The dosing of pumpable food materials such as stews and 
fillings is conventionally performed by the use of piston 
fillers which are made up of the following successive 
components: 
1) Material supply hopper, 2) Dosing cylinder connected to the hopper via a 3-way 
valve, 3) Tube for transportation of the food material from the 
dosing cylinder to the place of depositing, 4) Nozzle with cutting device for final depositing of 
the portions of mixed food materials. Such equipment is not suitable for fillings containing 
solid pieces because of problems which occur owing to 
weight variations caused by the long feeding distance 
between the dosing cylinder and the depositing nozzle as 
well as inadequate cutting of the material in the nozzle. 
The general dosage performance and the weight accuracy are 
often less than desirable. We have devised an applicator based on the same components 
conventionally used as described above, but in which the 
valve and the depositing nozzle are integrated into a 
single unit positioned directly above the depositing 
location. The transportation tube between the dosing 
cylinder and the nozzle is thus eliminated. Accordingly, the present invention provides an applicator 
such as claimed in Claim 1.  
 The pumpable food material may be supplied to the inlet 
opening of the valve house by any suitable means which is 
advantageously an inlet pipe connected to a supply of the 
pumpable food material and a pump for supplying the 
pumpable food material. The pumpable food material is 
conveniently stored in a hopper. The dosing means for dosing the pumpable food material 
through the dosing opening may be any suitable dosing means 
and such means is conveniently provided by a cylinder and a 
dosing piston which may be operated pneumatically or 
hydraulically. The outlet opening through which the pumpable food material 
may be deposited from the valve may be formed by the 
opening of a nozzle. The valve house is preferably tubular and the valve tap is 
conveniently positioned within the valve house. The valve 
tap is solid and is formed with a 
recess in its wall e.g. a milled out portion, to provide a 
channel between the valve tap body and the internal wall of 
the valve house so that, on reciprocation of the valve tap 
by rotation on its longitudinal axis, the channel enables 
either the inlet and

An applicator for dosing a pumpable food material 
comprising a dosing means (21) and a three-way valve (10) formed from 

a valve house (11) and a valve tap (12), the valve house (11) having an 
inlet opening (25) through which the pumpable food material may 

be supplied to the valve (10), a dosing opening (20) through which 
the pumpable food material may be dosed and an outlet 

opening (19) through which the pumpable food material may be 
deposited from the valve (10), the valve tap (12) being 

positioned within the valve house (11), is solid and formed 
with a recess (14) in its wall to provide a channel between 

the valve tap body and the internal wall of the valve house, 
is adapted to reciprocate around its longitudinal axis to 

bring the recess (14) in its wall into alignment with either 
the inlet (25) and dosing (20) openings together or the outlet 

(19) and dosing (20) openings together to communicate with the 
interior of the valve house, and wherein part of the edge 

of the recess (14) in the wall of the valve tap is adapted 
to form a cutting edge (15) characterised in that the outlet 

opening (19) is a nozzle positioned directly above the 
depositing location and the cutting edge (15) is adapted 

to cut the pumpable food material as it is deposited, and 
is shaped to enable the middle (16) of the nozzle outlet 

opening (19) to close before the extremities. 
An applicator according to claim 1 wherein the pumpable 
food material is supplied to the inlet opening (25) of the valve 

house (11) by an inlet pipe (24) connected to a supply of the 
pumpable food material and a pump for supplying the 

pumpable food material. 
An applicator according to claim 1 wherein the dosing 
mean (21) for dosing the pumpable food material through the 

dosing opening (20) is provided by a cylinder (21) and a dosing 
piston (22).  

 
An applicator according to claim 1 wherein the valve tap (12) 
is adapted so that, during reciprocation, the dosing 

opening (20) is in permanent communication with the interior of 
the valve house (11). 
A method for dosing pumpable food materials by means of 
a dosing means (21) and a three-way valve (10) formed from a valve 

house (11) and a valve tap (12) which is positioned within the 
valve house, is solid and formed with a recess (14) in its wall 

to provide a channel between the valve tap body and the internal 
wall of the valve house, and wherein part of the edge of the 

recess (14) in the wall of the valve tap is adapted to form a 
cutting edge (15), which comprises  

 

a. supplying a pumpable food material to the valve (10) through 
an inlet opening (25) of the valve house (11), 
b. dosing the pumpable food material by way of the dosing 
means (21) through a dosing opening (20) of the valve house (11), 
c. depositing the pumpable food material from the valve (10) 
through an outlet opening (19) of the valve house (11), wherein the 

valve tap (12) reciprocates around its longitudinal axis to 
open alternately the inlet and  

 
dosing (20) openings together to enable the pumpable food 

material to be supplied to the valve (10), and the outlet (19) and 
dosing openings (20) together characterised in that the 

outlet opening (19) is a nozzle and the pumpable food material 
is
 cut by the cutting edge (15) and deposited from the nozzle 
directly onto the depositing location, said cutting edge (15) 

being shaped to enable the middle (16) of the nozzle outlet 
opening (19) to close before the extremities. 
A method according to claim 5 wherein the inlet 
opening of the valve house faces upwards, the dosing 

opening faces laterally and the outlet opening faces 
downwards above the depositing location.
