<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a self-testing device for storage arrangements, decoders or the like for use in on-line operation, in which the word lines and/or the column lines of a storage matrix are connected to a test matrix (17). An error detector (27) generating an error signal when more than one word lines are active simultaneously is connected to the test matrix (17). As, for the most frequently occurring errors in the decoder, several word or column lines are activated, it is possible with this relatively simple and economically produced test matrix to perform a simple self-test during on-line operation.
