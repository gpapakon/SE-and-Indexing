<ABSTRACT>
A belt grill is described herein for continuously 
cooking fast food products on a conveyor formed of counter-rotating 

heat conductive belts. The belts (10,12) are 
heated by platens (14,16) disposed above and below whereby a 

run of the belts passes in heat conductive relationship 
between the platens, and the food to be cooked is placed in 

the nip between the rotating belts. The device further 
includes means (32,34) for tensioning the belts which can be 

automatically released by increasing the distance between 
the platens whereby when the distance exceeds a predetermined 

maximum, all tension on both belts will be released so 
that the belts can be quickly removed for cleaning or replacement. 

The belts are preferably Teflon (RTM) coated 
fiberglass and may be disposed at an angle to the horizontal 

to facilitate grease removal from the cooking process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to specific improvements to 
a belt grill or belt cooking device and, in particular, 
to such device useful in fast food type applications 
wherein large auantities of food portions are cooked 
rapidly and uniformly. Belt cooking devices known as belt grills have been 
in use for processing food products such as hamburgers 
and other meat patties, chicken and fish filets, 
pancakes, sandwiches, and other foods. Cooking is 
achieved by heat conduction to the food product as it is 
conveyed through heated platens. Typically, a belt grill 
uses upper and lower platens arranged in parallel planes 
which are heated by conventional means such as 
electricity, gas or the like. Opposed belts of flexible, 
heat resistant material convey the food between the hot 
platens and in contact therewith so that the uncooked 
food is fed onto the belt at one end and the cooked 
product exits the device at the other. The prior art 
includes both single belt devices and opposed belts. 
Typically, a belt may be constructed of metal such as 
stainless steel, links or mesh, or a more flexible 
material such as that sold under the Registered Trade 
Mark Teflon laminated over fiberglass fabric.  
 A typical belt grill (cf. preamble of claim 1) is described in 
US Patent No 3 646 880, 
in which there is disclosed a belt grill for cooking food 
comprising an upper frame assembly and a lower flame assembly 
disposed in registration thereon, each assembly including 
a heating platen and a continuous belt surrounding said 
platen in heat conductive relationship therewith. The 
platens each have respectively lower and upper heating 
surfaces which are mutually spaced a predetermined distance 
apart. The belts are rotatably mounted with at least a 
portion of a lower run of the upper belt and an upper run of 
the lower belt extending between the heating surfaces of the 
platens. The belts are mutually spaced to form a nip between 
the lower portion of the upper belt and the upper 
portion of the lower belt, which is adapted to receive food 
to be cooked. The grill also includes drive means coupled 
to the belts for driving said belts simultaneously in opposite 
directions, spacer means coupled between the frames for 
spacing the heat surface of the platens a predetermined 
distance apart, and tension means coupled between each frame 
and belt for applying tension to the belts. In U.S. Patent No. 5,044,264, a pair of opposed 
belts are used to convey food products between heated 
platens, and in that patent grill

<CLAIMS>
A belt grill for cooking food comprising: 

an upper frame assembly (48) and a lower frame assembly 
(50) disposed in registration, each assembly including a 

heated platen (14,16) and a continuous belt (10,12) surrounding 
said platen in heat conductive relationship therewith, 

said platens having, respectively, lower and upper 
heating surfaces mutually spaced a predetermined distance 

apart, said belts being mounted with at least a portion of a 
lower run of said upper belt (10) and an upper run of said 

lower belt (12) extending between the heating surfaces of 
said platens (14,16), and said belts being mutually spaced 

to form a nip between the lower portion of said upper belt 
and the upper portion of said lower belt adapted to receive 

food to be cooked; 
drive means (26,28) coupled to said belts (10,12) for 
driving said belts simultaneously in opposite directions; 
spacer means between said frame assemblies (48,50) for 
spacing the heating surfaces of said platens (14,16) a 

predetermined distance apart; and 
tension means (32,34), including biasing means (40,42), 
coupled between each frame and belt for applying tension to 

said belt; characterized by 
releasing means including a first means (64) coupled 
between said tension means (32) and said lower frame assembly 

(50), and a second means (66) coupled between said tension 
means (34) and said upper frame assembly (48), said 

biasing means (40,42) being depressed when said platens 
(14,16) are driven to exceed a predetermined distance apart 

by said spacer means, so as to simultaneously release the 
tension on both said belts. 
The grill of claim 1, wherein each frame assembly 
(48,50) includes a plurality of rollers (18,20,22,24) supporting

engagement with a respective belt. 
The grill of any one preceding claim, wherein said 
biasing means (40,42) are air springs.
