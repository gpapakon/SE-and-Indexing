measurement signal indicating that the accumulator is 

completely charged, derive at least part of the charge
current towards said dissipation means (20) and operate

said first pump (24).
Vehicle according to any of the preceding claims,
charaterized in that said conduits (26) of the cooling

circuit (34) extend between a cooling input (38) and a
