<ABSTRACT>
A golf club head (10) (e.g. an "iron" club head) has a 
body (11) defining a heel (12), toe (13), top wall 

(14), sole (15) and a front wall (17) defining an 
upwardly and rearwardly inclined front face (16) and 

rear face. The body has a forwardly extending main 
recess (21) located rearwardly of the front wall (17) 

and also an undercut recess (22) located directly 
rearwardly of the front wall rear face and extending 

outwardly from the main recess toward the top wall 
(14) and toward the bottom wall (16). The rear face of 

the front wall has a slant height dimension D₁ between 
uppermost and lowermost extents of the undercut recess 

(22) in a vertical plane, and the front wall (17) 
itself has a slant height dimension D₂ between 

uppermost and lowermost extents thereof in the plane, 
and .90

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to golf 
clubs, and more particularly to golf club irons of 
improved construction to achieve advantages, such as 
twist resistance, during impact with golf balls, and 
delayed momentum transfer to golf balls during 
stroking. In this regard, and in the past, irons 
evolved in design from flat back to hollow back 
structure to hollow back with an undercut recess as shown in document 
EP-A-0 582 366 (prior art falling under Article 54(3)EPC), the present 
invention providing a further evolution in back structure to achieve 
virtual head enlargement effects. Many efforts have been made to design iron 
heads to achieve higher energy availability for 
transfer to the golf ball when the ball is impacted by 
the head. However, no way was known, to our knowledge, 
to achieve delayed momentum transfer to the ball, over 
the very short time interval when the ball remains in 
contact with the head face, in the novel and unusual 
manner as achieved by the present invention; and no way 
was known to couple such delayed energy transfer with 
head twist resistance, in the manner to be described. It is a major object of the invention to 
provide an improved iron head construction meeting the 
need for delayed momentum transfer to the ball during  
 
club stroking, and also to provide club head increased 
twist resistance. Basically, the invention as embodied in 
a head metallic body, is constructed to define two 
intersecting recesses rearwardly of the head front wall, 
and bounded by head metallic extents projecting rearwardly 
proximate peripheral regions of the head face defining 
front wall. For example, the head may include: 
a) a body defining a forwardly extending main recess 
located rearwardly of the front wall, b) and the body also defining an undercut recess 
located directly rearwardly of the front wall and extending 
outwardly from the main recess toward at least two of the 
following: 
i) the top wall ii) the bottom wall iii) the toe iv) the heel The invention resides in a golf club head as defined 
in claim 1. Preferred features are defined in claims 2 to 
11 and 14 to 16. The invention also resides in multiple 
golf club heads in a set as defined in claim 12; a 
preferred feature is defined in claim 13. As will be seen, the undercut recess may extend 
outwardly from its intersection with the main recess toward 
all of the top and bottom walls, and the toe and heel, 
whereby the undercut recess may then bound the main recess. 
This construction facilitates slightly
