<ABSTRACT>
Color inkjet printers (10) commonly employ a plurality of 
print cartridges (22), usually either two or four, mounted in the 

printer carriage (20) to produce a full spectrum of colors. In 
order to optimize print quality, it is desirable to minimize the 

distance between a thermal inkjet printhead (26) and the media (90) 
that is being printed on. In a multiple printhead printer (10) 

only one printhead (26) can be the closest one to the media (90) 
due to the various mechanical tolerances of the printer (10). 

Since black text print quality is more sensitive to printhead-to-media 
distance than is color graphics quality, the overall print 

quality of both black text and color graphics is optimized by 
assuring that the black print cartridge (22) is closest to the 

media (90). Disclosed is a method for determining the relevant 
tolerances affecting printhead-to-media distance, analyzing the 

tolerance values to determine the range of tolerances and the 
greatest variation between one print cartridge and another, such 

that a determined percentage of the sampled print cartridges fall 
within this variation. This value is then used to offset the black 

print cartridge (22) carriage slot (24) so that the black print 
cartridge will be closest to the media (90).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of thermal 
inkjet printers and more particularly to improving black text 
quality in thermal inkjet printers using multiple black and color 
inkjet pen cartridges. The present invention is related to U.S. patent application 
08/056,639 filed April 30, 1993, now US-A-5 368 403, US-A-5 441 354 
and EP-A-0 622 241; USSN 08/056,229 filed 
April 30, 1993, now US-A-5 399 039 and US-A-5 456 543 and EP-A-0 622 222; 
USSN 08/057,241 filed April 30, 1993, now EP-A-0 622 208 and 
EP 93120341.8 filed December 16, 1993, now EP-A-0 622 240; all of the 
European applications being comprised in the state of the art according 
to Article 54(3) EPC. Thermal inkjet printers have gained wide acceptance. These 
printers are described by W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in "Ink Jet 
Devices," Chapter 13 of Output Hardcopy Devices (Ed. R.C. Durbeck 
and S. Sherr, San Diego: Academic Press, 1988) and U.S. Patents 
4,490,728 and 4,313,684. Thermal inkjet printers produce high  
 
quality print, are compact and portable, and print quickly and 
quietly because only ink strikes the paper. An inkjet printer forms a printed image by printing a pattern 
of individual dots at particular locations of an array defined for 
the printing medium. The locations are conveniently visualized as 
being small dots in a rectilinear array. The locations are 
sometimes "dot locations", "dot positions", or pixels". Thus, the 
printing operation can be viewed as the filling of a pattern of dot 
locations with dots of ink. Inkjet printers print dots by ejecting very small drops of ink 
onto the print medium and typically include a movable carriage that 
supports one or more printheads each having ink ejecting nozzles. 
The carriage traverses over the surface of the print medium, and 
the nozzles are controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate 
times pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller, 
wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is intended 
to correspond to the pattern of pixels of the image being printed. The typical thermal inkjet printhead (i.e., the silicon 
substrate, structures built on the substrate, and connections to 
the substrate) uses liquid ink (i.e., dissolved colorants or 
pigments dispersed in a solvent). It has an array of precisely 
formed nozzles attached to a printhead substrate that incorporates 
an array of firing chambers which receive liquid ink from the ink 
reservoir. Each chamber has a thin-film resistor, known as a 
thermal inkjet firing chamber
