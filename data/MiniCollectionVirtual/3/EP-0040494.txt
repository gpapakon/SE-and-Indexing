<ABSTRACT>
Carbapenam-3-carboxylic acids and carbapen-2-em-3-­
carboxylic acids substituted at the 1-position with an oxo, a 

hydroxy or an acetoxy group, variously substituted at the 
2-position with such groups as methyl, acetoxymethyl, 

methanesulfonyloxy, alkoxy, alkylthio, aminoalkylthio or 
amidinoalkylthio and optionally substituted at the 6-position 

with a hydroxyalkyl group, an acetoxyalkyl group or a conven­
tional penicillin side-chain, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts 

thereof and various esters thereof wherein the esterifying 
group is selectively removed in the laboratory, or hydrolyzed 

under physiological conditions. 
These compounds are useful either systemically or topi­
cally in the treatment of diseases caused by susceptible micro-­

organisms, as animal feed additives for promotion of growth, 
or in the preservation of biodegradable materials, or as inter­

mediates to compounds having such antibacterial activity. 
Key to the synthesis of these compounds is the light 
catalyzed rearrangement of 2-diazo-1-oxoceph-3-em-4-­

carboxylates to 1-oxocarbapen-2-em-3-carboxylates, a newly 
discovered reaction determined to be of general applicability.
