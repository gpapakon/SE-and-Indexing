<ABSTRACT>
A mixing assembly is provided which mixes liquids 
within a container. The mixing assembly has a vertically 

extending support frame (14) enclosed within an outer cabinet (12). 
Attached to at least one crank (94) which is in turn attached to the 

support frame, is a vertically extending rigid frame. A rotary 
drive apparatus rotates the crank to cause the rigid frame (16) to 

orbit in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis. 
The mixing apparatus also includes an attachment device (18) 
which removably attaches the container to the rigid frame. When 

the attachment device is in a lower position, the attachment 
device urges an upper support member (134) against the top of the 

container to clamp the container between the upper support member 
and a lower support member. The attachment device also includes 

a spring (146) to move the upper support member upward and off the top 
of the container when the attachment device is not locked in a 

lower position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to an assembly for 
mixing liquids and more particularly to a machine for agitating 
and mixing a liquid within a container such as paints or the 
like. Devices which mix liquids within a container by rapid, 
general oscillatory movement of the container are well known. 
However, to cause rapid movement of the container, forces must 
be applied to the container by the mixing device. The mixing 
device must balance the forces applied to the container, or 
vibration and/or damage to the mixing device may result. To balance the forces applied to the container, several 
prior art devices were developed which spins the container about 
one or more axes which correspond to a central axis of the 
container. Because the container is being spun about the central 
axis, the centrifugal forces created by the rotation of the 
liquid are directed against the container and not against the 
machine. The mixing effect of these devices is minimal, however, 
along the axis of rotation. Therefore, these machines must be 
operated for a longer period of time to perform adequate mixing. In addition, to prevent damage to the container by the 
mixing device during movement of the container, the container 
must be securely fastened to the mixing apparatus. The 
containers, however, are typically fungible; and therefore, the 
device which fastens the container to the mixing device should 
facilitate attachment and removal of the container. The  
 
attaching device should also provide some indication of when the 
container has been securely attached to the mixing device before 
operation of the mixing device. Furthermore, the attachment 
device must be able to attach containers having slightly 
differing dimensions without compromising the attachment or 
clamping force applied by the attaching device to the container. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide 
a device which mixes liquids held within a container. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a device which balances forces arising from the mixing 
movement of the container. Yet another object of the present invention is to 
provide a device which mixes the liquids quickly. It is a still further object of the present invention 
to provide a mixing device which allows quick and secure 
attachment and detachment of the container. A related object of 
the present invention is to provide a mixing device which 
provides an indication of when the secure attachment has 
occurred. It is also an object of the
