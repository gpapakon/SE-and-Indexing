<ABSTRACT>
A fluorinated polymer comprising at least three different groups within the 
polymer chain derived from reactive monomers, the monomers comprising: 


(a) a fluorinated, ethylenically unsaturated monomer; 
(b) a hydroxyl-containing, ethylenically unsaturated monomer; and 
(c) a polar, ethylenically unsaturated monomer. 
The fluorinated polymers provide a surfactant that is particularly useful in the 
coating of polymeric layers. The surfactants can reduce surface anomalies, such 

as mottle when used to coat photothermographic and thermographic elements from 
certain solvent systems. The 
present invention also provides photothermographic 
and thermographic elements comprising the foregoing fluorinated polymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
the use of novel fluorochemical surfactants in photothermographic
and thermographic elements. The use of fluorochemical surfactants in
coating compositions reduces disuniformities, such as mottle, in photothermographic
elements.Silver halide-containing photothermographic imaging materials (i.e., heat-developable
photographic materials) processed with heat, and without liquid
development, have been known in the art for many years. These materials, also
known as "dry silver" compositions or emulsions, generally comprise a support
having coated thereon: (1) a photosensitive material that generates elemental silver
when irradiated; (2) a non-photosensitive, reducible silver source; (3) a reducing
agent for the non-photosensitive, reducible silver source; and (4) a binder. The
photosensitive material is generally photographic silver halide which must be in
catalytic proximity to the non-photosensitive, reducible silver source. Catalytic
proximity requires an intimate physical association of these two materials so that
when silver specks or nuclei are generated by the irradiation or light exposure of
the photographic silver halide, those nuclei are able to catalyze the reduction of
the non-photosensitive, reducible silver source. It has long been understood that
elemental silver (AgÂ°) is a catalyst for the reduction of silver ions, and the photosensitive,
photographic silver halide may be placed into catalytic proximity with
the non-photosensitive, reducible silver source in a number of different fashions,
such as by partial metathesis of the reducible silver source with a halogen-containing
source (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,457,075); coprecipitation
of silver halide and reducible silver source material (see, for example, U.S. Patent 
No. 3,839,049); and other methods that intimately associate the photosensitive,
photographic silver halide and the non-photosensitive, reducible silver source.The non-photosensitive, reducible silver source is a material that contains
silver ions. The preferred non-photosensitive, reducible silver source comprises
silver salts of long chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, typically having from 10 to 30
carbon atoms. The silver salt of behenic acid or mixtures of acids of similar
molecular weight are generally used. Salts of other organic acids or other organic
materials, such as silver imidazolates, have been proposed and U.S. Patent No.
4,260,677 discloses the use of complexes of inorganic or organic silver salts as
non-photosensitive,
