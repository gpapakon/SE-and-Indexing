<ABSTRACT>
The transmission system includes a main station 
(MS) and a plurality of substations (SS1, .., SS16) which 

are each coupled to that main station via a respective 
individual link (l1/l16) and a common link (lc) and wherein 

first and second information packets are transmitted from 
substation transmitters (STR) to a main station receiver 

(MREC) and from a main station transmitter (MTR) to 
substation receivers (SREC) respectively. The main station 

includes a transmission timer arrangement (TTM) to time the 
operation of the main station transmitter and of each of 

the substation transmitters to avoid concurrent receipt by 
each one of the substation receivers of a second 

information packet sent thereto and of disturbing packets 
resulting from a first information packet sent by the 

corresponding substation transmitter. These disturbing 
packets can be reflected first packets or can result from 

crosstalk between the substation transmitter and the 
corresponding substation receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission 
system including a main station and a plurality of 
substations which are each coupled to said main station via 
a respective individual link and a common link and wherein 
first and second information packets are transmitted from 
substation transmitters to a main station receiver and from 
a main station transmitter to substation receivers 
respectively. Such a transmission system is already known in 
the art, e.g. from the Published European Patent 
Application No. 91870197.0-229 with publication No. 
0544975. The transmission system described therein is an 
optical system where the first and second information 
packets are transmitted in duplex mode, i.e. at the same 
time in both directions over the common and the individual 
links. In case first information packets emitted by a 
substation are reflected during their travel along the 
mentioned links and are thus received in this substation, 
the contents of second information packets received in this 
substation at the same time may be affected when the 
reflected packets are relatively important. These 
reflections may be caused by network elements such as 
couplers and splitters provided at the junction of the 
common and the individual links. Especially reflections 
produced by network elements located close to a receiver 
may affect received second information packets because the 
reflected first packets are then not or poorly attenuated. 
On the contrary network elements located for example 
between the splitter and the main station have a smaller 
adverse effect in the substation because of the attenuation 
produced in the splitter. In a similar way, the transmission of first 
information packets by the substation transmitters can 
cause crosstalk which, when relatively important, can  
 
negatively influence the receipt of second information 
packets by the related substation receivers. Obviously, the adverse effect of the above 
disturbing packets, i.e. the reflected packets or packets 
resulting from crosstalk, could be minimized by 
considerably attenuating them. However, this usually 
implies that the first and second information packets are 
attenuated as well. Another way of avoiding the negative effect of 
reflections or crosstalk is to work in ping-pong mode, i.e. 
by using a protocol which realizes that a substation never 
sends first information packets when the main station is 
sending second information packets and vice versa. However, 
this considerably reduces the bandwidth
