<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel composition for
two-cycle internal combustion engines which comprises a
major amount of fuel boiling in the gasoline range and a
minor amount of a lubricant composition comprising a
lubricating oil and an additive formulation containing a
molybdenum/sulfur complex of a basic nitrogen compound.Over the past several decades the use of spark-ignited
two-cycle (two-stroke) internal combustion engines including
rotary engines such as those of the Wankel type has steadily
increased. They are presently found in power lawn mowers
and other power-operated garden equipment, power chain saws,
pumps, electrical generators, marine outboard engines,
snowmobiles, motorcycles, and the like.The increasing use of two-cycle engines coupled with
increasing severity of the conditions in which they have
operated has led to an increasing demand for oils to
adequately lubricate such engines. Among the problems
associated with lubrication of two-cycle engines are piston
ring sticking, rusting, lubrication failure of connecting
rods and main bearings and the general formation on the
engine's interior surface of carbon and varnish deposits.
The formation of varnish is a particularly vexatious problem
since the build-up of varnish on piston and cylinder walls
is believed to ultimately result in ring sticking which
leads to failure of the sealing function of piston rings.
Such seal failure causes loss of cylinder compression which
is particularly damaging in two-cycle engines because they
depend on suction to draw the new fuel charge into the 
exhausted cylinder. Thus, ring sticking can lead to
deterioration in engine performance, and unnecessary
consumption of fuel and/or lubricant. Spark plug fouling
and engine port plugging problems also occur in two-cycle
engines.A variety of compounds have been proposed as additives for
fuel-lubricating oil mixtures to be used in two-cycle
internal combustion engines. For example, U.S. Patent
No. 4,708,809 to Davis discloses a lubricant composition for
two-cycle engines comprising a major amount of an oil of
lubricating viscosity and a minor amount of at least one
alkyl phenol having at least one hydrocarbon-based group of
at least 10 aliphatic carbon atoms. Preferably, such
lubricant composition will also contain a detergent-dispersant
additive selected from (i) a neutral or basic
metal salt of an organic sulfur acid, phenol or carboxylic
acid, (ii) a hydrocarbyl-substituted amine, (iii) an
acylated, nitrogen-containing compound having a substituent
of
