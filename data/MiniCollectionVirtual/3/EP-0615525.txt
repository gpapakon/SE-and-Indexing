<ABSTRACT>
Matrices for electrokinetic and chromatographic separations, based on a unique class of mono- and disubstituted (on the amido nitroagen) acrylamides (e.g., acrylamido-N-ethoxy ethanol, acrylamido-N, N-di-ethoxy ethanol) offer the following advantages: a) strong resistance to alkaline hydrolysis (most zone separations occurring at basic pH values); b) a high hydrophilicity and c) greater porosity, due to the larger Mr value of the monomers. Such matrices can be prepared as 'chemically cross-linked' gels or as 'physical gels', the latter consisting of 'strings' of monofunctional monomer in the absence of cross-linker, at concentrations above the entanglement threshold. It is moreover possible to further increment the gel porosity by polymerizing it in presence of laterally-aggregating agents (e.g., polyethylene glycol of Mr 6-20000 Da), thus obtaining matrices which allow better resolution of large Mr proteins and of nucleic acid fragments; by polymerizing the matrix in presence of a gradient of the laterally-aggregating agent, it is possible to obtain a porosity gradient even at constant per cent of monomers in the gel. Finally, photopolymerization (e.g., with methylene blue and a redox couple, sodium toluenesulfinate and diphenyliodonium chloride and light), instead with the standard red/ox catalysts, prevents formation of N-oxides of amines present in the polymerizing solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to hydrophilic polyacrylamide gels, 
to be used as matrices, possessing the following unique 
characteristics: 
a) very high resistance to alkaline hydrolysis; b) high hydrophilicity, so as to avoid hydrophobic 
interaction with macromolecules; c) higher porosity (either due to the use of monomers 
of larger molecular mass, or due to the use of laterally 
aggregating agents in the polymerization step); 
d) lack of oxidizing properties, typical of matrices 
polymerized with the standard red/ox couple 
(persulphate and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene diamine, 
TEMED). Matrices exhibiting the above characteristics are 
obtained, according to the present invention, via the 
polymerization or co-polymerization of a unique class 
of N-mono- or di-substituted acrylamide monomers, by 
using methods which also belong to the present 
invention. Included in the present invention are also 
matrices obtained with mixtures of such polymers or co-polymers 
of the afore-mentioned acrylamides, or with 
mixtures of such polymers and co-polymers with agarose, 
dextrans or other hydrophilic polymers. Polyacrylamide matrices, for separation in zone 
electrophoresis, were introduced already in 1959 by 
Raymond and Weintraub (Science,.130, 1959, 711-712) and 
further promoted for use in disc electrophoresis by  
 
Davis (Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 121, 1964, 404-427), 
Ornstein (Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 121, 1964, 321-349) and 
Hjertén (J. Chromatogr. 11, 1963, 66-70). Their 
popularity as electrophoretic supports stems from some 
fundamental properties, such as: a) optical 
transparency, including the ultraviolet; b) electrical 
neutrality, due to the absence of charged groups; c) 
possibility of synthesizing gels in a wide interval of 
porosities. During the years, the couple of monomers 
which has attained the greatest popularity has been 
acrylamide coupled to a cross-linker, N,N'-methylene 
bisacrylamide (P.G. Righetti, J. Biochem. Biophys. 
Methods 19, 1989, 1-20). However, several defects of 
such a matrix have been noticed upon prolonged use. The 
most dramatic drawback is its instability at alkaline 
pH values: after an electrophoretic run (most 
electrokinetic separations occur at alkaline pHs for 
both proteins and nucleic acids), the dangling amido 
bonds are partly hydrolyzed, originating carboxylic 
groups, which stay covalently bound to the polymer, 
which is thus transformed into a polyacrylate. This 
phenomenon generates strong electroendo-osmosis, with 
matrix swelling and considerable
