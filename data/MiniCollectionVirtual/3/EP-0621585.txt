<ABSTRACT>
The head (10) includes two substantially 
identical MR elements (12,14), separated by a thin film of titanium 

nitride (16) having a resistivity of 1000µΩ-cm. Signal loss due to 
current shunting in the shorted DMR head is significantly reduced 

by use of the titanium nitride film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetoresistive 
reproduce head and in particular to a shorted dual element 
magnetoresistive (DMR) head. A shorted DMR reproduce head for reproducing 
signals recorded in a magnetic recording medium is disclosed 
in U.S. Patent No. 5,193,038 issued March 9, 1993 to Smith. 
The shorted DMR head includes a pair of identical 
magnetoresistive (MR) stripes separated by a non-magnetic 
conductive spacer. Sputtered titanium has been employed as 
the conductive spacer material. The resistivity of 
sputtered titanium is about 100µΩ-cm and the resulting 
shorted DMR reproduce head suffers from a roughly 40% signal 
loss due to current shunting in the head. The problem to be 
solved by the present invention is to provide a shorted DMR 
reproduce head with reduced signal loss. The problem is solved according to the present 
invention by providing a shorted DMR reproduce head wherein 
the spacer between the magnetoresistive stripes is a layer 
of titanium nitride having a resistivity value of between 
200µΩ-cm and 2,000µΩ-cm. The titanium nitride is a high 
melting point metallic compound with high thermal and 
electrical conductivity and low grain boundary and bulk 
diffusivity. Generally, the resistivity of stoichiometric 
titanium nitride film is lower than that of pure titanium 
films. However, we have discovered that deposited titanium 
nitride films can have a wide range of resistivity values 
depending on the deposition conditions. Particularly, when 
depositing titanium nitride films by reactive sputtering,  
 
increasing the nitrogen gas flow or reducing the deposition 
rate by lowering the sputtering power, in the presence of 
some ambient oxygen, results in higher resistivity titanium 
nitride films. By controlling the deposition conditions of 
the titanium nitride films to produce a film having 
resistivity between 200µΩ-cm and 2,000µΩ-cm and preferably 
1,000µΩ-cm, the signal loss due to current shunting in the 
resulting shorted DMR may be reduced to less than 5%. In 
addition, the titanium nitride layer is easy to prepare and 
can be deposited in sequence with the MR elements in the 
same sputtering chamber. Fig. 1 is a schematic perspective view of a 
shorted DMR reproduce head according to the present 
invention; Fig. 2 is a flow chart showing the steps of making
