<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phthalocyanines, particularly to 
aryloxy substituted phthalocyanines which exhibit strong, narrow band 
absorption at 600 to 800nm. According to the present invention there is provided a 
phthalocyanine of Formula (1): 
(R)aMkPc(O-R¹)b(O-R²)cXd   Formula (1)wherein:
 
   MkPc is a phthalocyanine nucleus of the Formula (2): 
in which 
Mis a metal atom; ks inverse of ½ valency of M; Rs a heterocyclic compound or a tertiary amine; each R¹ndependently is an aryl or heterocyclic radical; each R²ndependently is an alkyl or cycloalkyl radical; each Xndependently is -H or halogen; as 1 or 2; bs an integer from 1 to 8; cs 0 or is an integer from 1 to 4; ds an integer from 4 to 15; and b+c+d = 16. M is preferably a transition metal, more preferably a metal 
from the first transition row of the Periodic Table and especially 
iron, or cobalt. Where M is iron, or cobalt it is preferably present  
 
in the divalent state i.e. as FeII, or CoII. It is especially preferred 
that M is FeII. The heterocyclic compound represented by R preferably has one 
or more heteroatom(s) each of which has at least one pair of electrons 
and is capable of complexing with the central metal, M. The 
heterocyclic compound represented by R preferably contains at least one 
nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen atom as the heteroatom or contains a 
combination of such atoms. Suitable heterocyclic compounds include 
pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline, bipyridyl, pyrazine, pyrimidine, 
pyridazine, triazine, thiophene, furan, pyrrole, pyrazole, imidazole, 
thiazole, isothiazole, thiadiazole, oxazole, isooxazole, pyran, 
oxazine, morpholine, indole, bipyridyl each of which may be optionally 
substituted. Suitable optional substituents for the heterocyclic 
groups represented by R may be selected from C₁₋₈-alkyl, C₁₋₈-alkoxy, 
-NH₂, -NHC₁₋₆-alkyl, -N(C₁₋₆-alkyl)₂, -Cl, -F, -Br, -CN, -CF₃, -NO₂, -OH, 
C₁₋₄-alkylphenyl, C₁₋₈-alkylC₁₋₈-alkoxy, C₁₋₈-alkoxyC₁₋₈-alkyl and 
C₁₋₈-alkoxyC₁₋₈-alkoxy. The heterocyclic compound represented by R is 
preferably an optionally substituted pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline, 
bipyridyl and pyrazine, more preferably an optionally substituted 
pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline, bipyridyl and pyrazine which is 
unsubstituted or which carry C₁₋₈-alkyl, C₁₋₄-alkylphenyl, -CN or 
-N(C₁₋₆-alkyl)₂ substituents and especially pyridine, isoquinoline, 
bipyridyl and pyridines substituted in the 3- and/or 4- and/or 5 
positions by t-butyl, benzyl, -CN, -N(CH₃)₂ or -N(C₂H₅)₂. The tertiary amine represented by
