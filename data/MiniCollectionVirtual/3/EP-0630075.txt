<ABSTRACT>
Symmetrical communication portions formed in 
respective inner surfaces of arms of a lever extend from 

an inner end surface of a guide groove to an inner 
peripheral surface of a rotation hole. To connect the 

lever to the selected housing, the lever is moved parallel 
relative to the male housing in such a manner that 

rotation pins move along the respective guide grooves and 
communication portions until they are rotatably received 

in the respective rotation holes. Accordingly, there is 
no need to elastically deform the lever in order to attach 

the lever to the housing, and therefore, the burden on the 
operator is small because the two rotation pins are 

simultaneously guided to the respective rotation holes by 
the respective guide grooves. Therefore the attaching 

operation can be carried out easily and positively. After 
the lever is attached to the selected housing, another 

housing may be connected to the selected housing also 
using the communication portions of the lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lever-type connector
and a method for assembling and connecting a connector in
which, for example, in the installation of a wire harness
in an automobile, a housing having male terminals is
connected to a housing having female terminals by a lever
mounted on one of the two housings.In the installation of a wire harness in an
automobile, a lever-type connector is used for connecting
a housing having male terminals to a housing having female
terminals. In such a connector, a rotation hole is formed
in an inner surface of each of two opposed arms of a
U-shaped lever. Also, a guide groove of a generally
volute shape is formed in the inner surface of each arm
and is open to a distal end surface of the arm. A
rotation pin is formed on each of opposite outer side
surfaces of one of the two housings, the respective
rotation holes in the lever are rotatably fitted on these
rotation pins and a guide pin is formed on each of
opposite outer side surfaces of the other housing.In such a lever-type connector, the two housings
are initially moved toward each other, and the guide pins
on the other housing are received respectively in the
guide grooves in the lever. Then, the other housing is
moved toward the one housing through leverage produced by
the engagement of the guide pins in the respective guide
grooves upon rotation of the lever about the rotation
pins. Finally, the two housings are connected to connect
the male terminals to the female terminals. Thus, the
connecting operation is carried out according to this
procedure.Conventionally, in such a lever-type connector,
for attaching the lever to the housing, the lever is
elastically deformed or expanded to move the two arms away
from each other. In this condition the rotation pin is
fitted in the rotation hole in one of the two arms, and
thereafter, the lever is further deformed so as to be 
expanded. In this condition, the other rotation pin is
fitted in the rotation hole in the other arm.This method, however, has a drawback because the
operator is required to produce a large force required for
deforming or expanding the lever. In addition, because
the rotation hole and the rotation pin are concealed
inside the arm during the attaching operation, the
operator cannot confirm the positions of the rotation hole
with respect to the rotation pin using his or her eyes.
This has resulted in a drawback that much time and labor
are required for the attaching operation, thus adversely
affecting the efficiency of the operation. The document

a first housing (1) having one of a plurality of male
and female terminals and one of a pair of rotation pins (2) formed on respective opposite side surfaces of the one housing (1)

and a pair of guide pins (12);
a second housing (11) having the other of the
plurality male and female terminals and the other of the

rotation pins (2) and the guide pins (12); and
a lever (21) connected to one of the first housing (1)
and the second housing (12), whichever includes the

rotation pins (2),
the lever (21) having a main body (21) spanning the
width of the one housing (1) and an arm (22) attached at

each end of the main body (21), the arms (22) having opposing inner surfaces and each arm including:
one of a through hole (23) and a blind hole (23) open to said inner surface for
receiving a respective one of the rotation pins (2) to

pivotably mount the lever (21) on the rotation pins (2) of
the selected housing (1); and
a guide groove (24) being formed in the inner surface and having an introduction portion
(25) adjacent a distal end of the arm (22) and a fitting

guide portion (26) of a volute shape being disposed closer
to a proximal end of the arm (22) than the introduction

portion (25), said guide groove (24) being open at one end to a side surface of said arm (22), 
characterized in that
said fitting guide portion (26) is located between and
contiguous with the introduction portion (25) and the one

of the through hole (23) and the blind hole (23).
The lever-type connector of claim 1, wherein

said lever (21) is generally U-shaped.
The lever-type connector of claim 1, wherein the lever
(21) is pivotable between a first and a second position and


wherein each guide pin (12) is positioned in a
respective introduction portion (25) when the lever (21) is

located in said first position, and
each guide pin (12) is engaged with its respective
fitting guide portion (26) when the lever (21) is pivoted

to said second position.
