<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated
circuit device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor
integrated circuit device equipped with an answer system
for teaching optional functions to a diagnostic system.A semiconductor integrated circuit device such as a
dynamic random access memory device has a wide variety of
optional functions such as a high-speed page mode, a nibble
mode and a static column mode, and the manufacturer tries
to increase the optional functions for standing at
advantage over other semiconductor manufacturer. The new
functions are, by way of example, an optional refresh cycle
time, an optional power voltage and different parallel
input/ output bits. In fact, those optional functions
result in tens to hundreds different models sharing a
fundamental circuit arrangement.The manufacturer carries out inspections for the
products before delivery to a customer so as to guarantee
the device characteristics listed in the specification. The inspections are computerized, and a diagnostic system
sequentially executes test sequences for the products.
However, the optional functions require respective test
sequences, and, for this reason, the manufacturer needs to
prepare individual test programs for the different models.
This results in a large amount of time and labor for not
only preparation of these test programs but also management
of the test sequences. EP-A-144 680 shows a semiconductor integrated circuit on a
single semiconductor chip in which a diagnostic system sends
an inquiry signal to an IC and in which the IC sends back the
mode signal of its sub-mode.The object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor
integrated circuit device, which allows a manufacturer
to easily examine optional functions and which has an enhanced
pin economy.This object is solved by the features of the main claim.Further advantages features are mentioned in the sub-claims. The features and advantages of the semiconductor
integrated circuit device according to the present
invention will be more clearly understood from the
following description taken in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings in which:
Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing the arrangement
of a dynamic random access memory device according to the
present invention;Figs. 2A and 2B are circuit diagrams showing the
arrangement of an answer system incorporated in the dynamic 
random access memory device shown in Fig. 1;Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing the dynamic random
access memory device coupled with a diagnostic
