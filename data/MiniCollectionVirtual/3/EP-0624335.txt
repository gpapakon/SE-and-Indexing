<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a grating disc (25) for insertion into a working container (1) of a multipurpose kitchen appliance which can be closed by a lid (19). The grating disc (25) can, on the one hand, be coupled in a rotationally fixed manner to a drive shaft (9) reaching into the working container (1) and consequently turns inside the working container (1) when the drive shaft (9) rotates. On the other hand, on its top side (26) facing the lid (19) it has grating elements (27) suitable for grating foodstuffs, a filling shaft (38) for foodstuffs being arranged on the lid (19). At its edge region, the grating disc (25) has means (53) which belong to a locking device (24) and by means of which an insert (4), which can be inserted into the working container (1), is substantially tubular and is equipped with a screening device (31), can be detachably connected to the grating disc (25). The grating disc (25) is fitted in the working container (1) at a height such that it forms, together with the tubular insert (4), a container suitable for extracting juice from foodstuffs. The filling shaft (38) is taken down as far as the grating disc (25). As a result, the grating disc can be used not only for producing finely grated foodstuffs but also, in conjunction with the tubular insert (4) and the screening device (31), for juice production.

<CLAIMS>
A grating disk (25) with an essentially tubular 
inset (4) provided with a straining device (31) and being 

detachably connectible with the grating disk (25) by 
means of a locking device (24), with the grating disk 

(25) and the inset (4) serving for insertion in a processing 
container (1), closable by a cover (19), of a 

multi-purpose food processor and being adapted to be 
coupled in a non-rotating relationship to a drive shaft 

(9) extending into the processing container (1), consequently 
rotating in the interior of the processing container 

(1) when the drive shaft (9) rotates, with the 
grating disk (25) having on its upper face (26) close to 

the cover (19) grater elements (27) suitable for comminuting 
food materials, and with the cover (19) providing 

a feed tube (38) for inserting food materials, the 
end of the feed tube on the side close to the container 

extending down to the grating disk (25),
characterized in that
 the locking 
device (24) is comprised of a bayonet-type lock (50, 55) 

formed between the inset (4) and the grating disk (25), 
the lock providing on the one side locking tabs (50) uniformly 

distributed on a ring (42) of the inset (4) and 
provided with slots (52), and comprising on the other 

side projections (53) projecting from the outer periphery 
of the grating disk (25), the projections engaging in 

turn within the slots (52) of the locking tabs (50) when 
in the locked position, with the trailing edges (59) of 

the grating disk (25), when viewed in the direction of 
rotation (U), then abutting stops (60) of the slots (52). 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in claim 
1,
characterized in that
 with the 
grating disk (25) and the inset (4) in the locked position, 

a knob (57) projecting from the upper face (26) of 
the grating disk (25) is in engagement with a corresponding 

notch (58) formed on the locking tabs (50). 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in claim 

1,
characterized in that
 the perimeter 
(54) of the grating disk (25) is centrally located on 

a ring (56) provided on the inset (4).  
 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in claim 
1,
characterized in that
 the grating 
disk (25) is provided with an engaging device (43) configured 

as a stem (6), and that the stem (6) is fabricated 
from a plastic material injection-molded onto the 

center of the grating disk (25). 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in claim 
4,
characterized in that
 the stem 
(6) has its end remote from the grating disk (25) rotatably 

journaled on the cover (19). 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in claim 
5,
characterized in that
 a cylindrical 
pin (15) fabricated from metal is secured within the 

stem (6), the pin engaging a centering sleeve (18) provided 
on the cover (19). 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in claim 
4,
characterized in that
 the stem 
(6) is connectible with the grating disk (25) by means of 

a further releasable locking device, preferably a 
bayonet-type locking means which engages within a bore 

(28) provided in the center of the grating disk (25). 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in claim 
1,
characterized in that
 the straining 
device (31) is comprised of a strainer basket inserted 

into the tubular inset (4) and provided with 
lamellae (33) relatively spaced by a very small distance 

and projecting down to the lower end of the inset (4), 
the lamellae (33) being spaced from the inner wall (35) 

of the inset (4) by a very small distance. 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in claim 
1,
characterized in that
 the straining 
device is comprised of straining holes of a very 

small cross-section formed in the inset (4), and that the 
inset is manufactured from stainless metal.  

 
The grating disk with inset as claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 the grating 
disk (25) is manufactured from metal, preferably high-grade 

steel, and that the grater elements (27) are 
arranged on the upper face (26) of the solid grating disk 

(25) in a uniform pattern, and that the grater elements 
(27) are formed by raised chips punched out of the upper 

face (26) of the grating disk (25).
