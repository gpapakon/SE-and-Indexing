<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions 
containing selected moisture-sensitive ingredients; it provides 

a combination between such compositions and a packaging system 
containing them, such a combination providing optimum protection 

against moisture to said selected ingredients, and thus 
excellent storage stability to the finished compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions
containing selected moisture-sensitive ingredients; it provides
a combination between such compositions and a packaging system
containing them, such a combination providing optimum protection
against moisture to said selected ingredients, and thus
excellent storage stability to the finished compositions.The problem of the negative interaction of moisture on
detergent ingredients during storage, and in particular during
prolonged storage has been known for a long time to the
detergent manufacturer. Such an interaction is either due to
the direct action of water on certain ingredients, resulting in
their decomposition and/or loss of activity, or to the action on
other ingredients of the decomposition products of certain
moisture-sensitive ingredients, also leading to decomposition 
and/or loss of activity. Numerous technologies have been
proposed, and many implemented, which call for addition of
special ingredients, or modification of the existing
ingredients, in order to protect the finished composition
against moisture.Relatively little attention however has been given to the
packaging systems containing detergent compositions, in relation
to the above problem. WO92/06163 focuses on the importance of
the humidity level, of the composition, tests being made using
closed wax laminated cardboard cartons. EP 0467 481 focuses on
gaz and/or vapour tight packages for vacuum packaging.The present invention is based on the finding that the
selection of a particular packaging system, in combination with
a careful control of the humidity level in the composition, can
surprisingly solve the storage stability problem described
above, for a series of particularly moisture-sensitive
ingredients which are identified herein.The present invention thus provides the combination of
detergent compositions containing selected moisture-sensitive
ingredients, and controlled humidity level, with a protecting
system with selected moisture vapour transfer rate
characteristics, as in claim 1.By the term detergent composition herein is meant preferably
laundry detergent compositions, although automatic dishwashing
compositions and laundry additive compositions are also
encompassed.The present compositions are characterized by their
Equilibrium Relative Humidity below 30% by weight at
35°C. For the purposes of the present invention, Equilibrium
Relative Humidity is measured as follows : 300 g of product is
place in a 1 liter container made of a water impermeable
material and
