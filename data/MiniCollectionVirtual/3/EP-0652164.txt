<ABSTRACT>
An infusion package (2) comprising two panels of porous 
material sealed together at their peripheral margin (3) 

to form an infusion (5) containing compartment (4). Two 
further regions (6) of the panels spaced inwardly from 

their peripheral margin (3) are also sealed together. A 
drawstring (7) enters (8) and exit (9) the compartment 

(4) and is looped within the compartment (4) around the 
sealed regions (6). The ends of the drawstring (7) 

outside the infusion package may be provided with tags 
(10). In use, pulling the ends of the drawstring (7) in 

opposed directions (11) causes the package at least 
partially to collapse, thus expressing residual liquid 

therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to infusion packages 
such as tea bags or coffee bags which contain a 
substance to be infused in a liquid. Tea bags are sealed porous bags containing tea 
leaves which are placed in boiling water in a cup or 
tea-pot, for example, in order to make tea. It is 
usual, particularly in the case where the bags are 
placed in a cup or mug to remove the tea bags prior to 
the tea being drunk. However, when the tea bag is 
removed, it still contains liquid and thus tends to drip 
and leave liquid on any surface below it. This is 
undesirable in view of the strongly staining nature of 
tea (and other infusible substances). It is usual 
therefore to squeeze the tea bag into a relatively dry 
state when it is removed, using a teaspoon, for example, 
to remove excess liquid from the tea bag. However, this 
method of removing the excess liquid from the tea bag is 
not particularly efficient. It is difficult to remove 
the liquid whilst ensuring that it all remains within 
the cup or mug, and it not always convenient or possible 
to have a teaspoon or other utensil readily to hand. A number of methods have been proposed to overcome 
the above problem, and to provide an efficient and 
convenient method for removing the residual liquid from 
an infusion package such as a tea bag. In most of these 
prior art methods, some form of device for applying an 
external pressure to the infusion package to squeeze out 
the liquid is provided. For example, in WO 91/13580 a 
string is provided which is fixed to one-side of the 
infusion package and passes through the package, so that 
after use the package may be compressed by pulling on 
the string whilst pressing down on the side of package 
from which the string exits in order to squeeze the  
 
opposite sides of the package together. A piece of 
cardboard may be provided on the string with which to 
press on the infusion package. The above device has a number of disadvantages. 
Firstly, if a card is not provided, then some other 
means such as the user's fingers must be found to press 
down on the infusion package, which is clearly not 
significantly any more convenient then simply using a 
tea spoon or other utensil to press on the package. The 
card itself, if provided, has a tendency to become 
saturated with the expelled liquid and thus may drip, 
thereby negating the desired effect. Furthermore, the 
squeezing effect is solely between opposite points on 
the edge of the package, thus it is not very efficient 
and does not tend to remove all

<CLAIMS>
An infusion package (2) comprising two panels of 
porous material which are sealed together around a 

peripheral margin (3) of the package to define an 
infusion containing compartment (4), the panels further 

being sealed together in at least one region (6) which 
is spaced inwardly from the peripheral margin, and a 

drawstring (7) which enters and exits the infusion 
containing compartment of the package via the peripheral 

margin and which is looped within the compartment around 
the sealed together region (6) of the panels in such a 

way that pulling on end portions of the drawstring in 
opposite directions (11) causes the package at least 

partially to collapse, thereby expressing liquid from 
the package. 
An infusion package as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
two or more spaced-apart, discrete sealed regions are 

provided between the panels and the drawstring is looped 
around each sealed together region. 
An infusion package as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the sealed region or regions are in the form of 

discrete, small islands. 
An infusion package as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the islands have rounded corners. 
An infusion package as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the drawstring (7) is a single length of 

string which enters and exits the infusion containing 
compartment at spaced apart locations (8, 9) on the 

peripheral margin (3) and extends around two sealed 
regions within the package which are located at opposing 

corners of the package. 
An infusion package as claimed in any preceding 
claim, comprising four sealed together regions within 

the package with one region being adjacent each corner 
of the infusion containing compartment close to the 

peripheral margin, and the drawstring passing between 
each sealed region and the peripheral margin and 

crossing over itself before exiting the package, so as 
to form a loop around the edge of the infusion 

containing compartment. 
An infusion package as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the ends of the drawstring outside the 

infusion package are provided with tags (10). 
An infusion package as claimed in claim 7, wherein 
both ends of the drawstring are attached to a single tag 

(10) which can be torn apart in use. 
An infusion package as claimed in claim 8, wherein 
the single tag is perforated or partially cut through 

along a centre line (12). 
An infusion package as claimed in claim 7, 8 or 9, 
wherein the tag has a size of similar dimension to the 

infusion package. 
An infusion package as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the sealing of the panels on the 

peripheral margin at the entry and exit points (8, 9) of 
the drawstring is interrupted. 
An infusion package as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the arrangement of the drawstring and 

sealed regions within the infusion containing 
compartment is symmetrical about a plane of symmetry 

passing through the centre of the infusion package.
