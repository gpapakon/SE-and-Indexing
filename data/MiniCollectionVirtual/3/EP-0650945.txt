<ABSTRACT>
Metal and ceramic sintered bodies and layers are produced by dispersing nanocrystalline metal or ceramic powder in which less than 1% of the individual particles have a deviation of more than 40% from the mean particle size and no individual particles have a deviation of more than 60% from the mean particle size in water and/or a polar organic solvent as dispersion medium in the presence of at least one low molecular weight organic compound which has at least one functional group which can react and/or interact with groups present on the surface of the powder particles, removing the dispersion medium and sintering the surface-modified metal or ceramic powder which has been processed into green bodies or layers prior to or after the removal of the dispersion medium.
