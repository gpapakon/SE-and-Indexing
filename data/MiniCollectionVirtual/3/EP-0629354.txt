<ABSTRACT>
When manufacturing a cigarette which is completely or partly formed of strands or sides of expanded tobacco or short strands, or else containing a smaller amount of tobacco, difficulties are encountered in obtaining a cigarette which has an acceptable measured compressibility value. By providing a cigarette-manufacturing machine (1) with a cam (3) which has at least one additional bearing surface (32A, 33A, 34A, 35A) it is possible, just before the operation (15) of nipping the top off the twist (20), to compress a certain number of regions (22) of the said twist, thereby increasing the tobacco density in these regions. A cigarette including one or more regions (22) with a tobacco density which has been increased in this way has a measured compressibility value which is equivalent to a normal cigarette.

Process of manufacture of a rod (20) made up of tobacco and/or of 
other raw materials of the tobacco industry (2), portions (21) of the length of 

which are periodically compressed in order to form end zones of cigarettes of 
higher density, this operation taking place on a cigarette-manufacturing 

machine (1) when the rod is held and conveyed by a porous belt (11), before 
the trimming operation (15) of the rod (20),
 
   characterised in that
 
   at least one other portion (22) of the length of the rod (20), disposed 

between two of said compressed portions (21) corresponding to the end zones, 
is also compressed, or its density is increased, respectively. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the compression of 
said other rod portion (22) is made by the same device (16; 3) as that effecting 

the compression of said portions (21) corresponding to the end zones. 
Device permitting a periodic compression, or a periodic increase in 
the density of tobacco, respectively, of a rod of tobacco and/or of other raw 

material of the tobacco industry (2), for carrying out a process according to 
claim 2, comprising a cam (3) rotating along an axis perpendicular to the rod 

(20) and disposed below said rod and comprising at least a first blade (31) 
comprising a support surface (31A) intended periodically to compress portions 

(21) of the rod in order to form the end zones of cigarettes having increased 
density,
 
characterised in that
 
   said cam includes at least one other blade (32, 33, 34, 35) comprising a 

support surface (32A, 33A, 34A, 35A) intended to compress, or to increase the 
density of tobacco, respectively, of another portion (22) of the rod. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the length of the 
support surface (32A, 33A, 34A, 35A) of said other blade or blades (32, 33, 34,  

 
35) is less than the length of the support surface (31A) of said first blade or 

blades (31). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the height relative 
to the rod of the support surface (32A, 33A, 34A, 35A) of said other blade or 

blades (32, 33, 34, 35) is equal to the height of the support surface (31A) of 
said first blade or blades (31). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the height relative 
to the rod of the support surface (32A, 33A, 34A, 35A) of said other blade or 

blades (32, 33, 34, 35) is different from the height of the support surface (31A) 
of said first blade or blades (31). 
Device according to one of the claims 3 to 6, characterised in that the 
width of the support surface (32A, 33A, 34A, 35A) of said other blade or blades 

(32, 33, 34, 35) is equal to the width of the support surface (31A) of said first 
blade or blades (31). 
Device according to one of the claims 3 to 6, characterised in that the 
width of the support surface (32A, 33A, 34A, 35A) of said other blade or blades 

(32, 33, 34, 35) is less than the width of the support surface (31A) of said first 
blade or blades (31). 
Product of the tobacco industry, especially cigarette, obtained 
according to the process of one of the claims 1 to 2, and by a device according 

to one of the claims 3 to 8, comprising portions (21) of its length compressed at 
increased density, corresponding to its two ends,
 
   characterised in that
 
   it includes in addition at least one other compressed or increased-density 

portion (22), respectively, disposed between the two compressed ends. 
Product of the tobacco industry according to claim 9, characterised 
in that the rate of compression, or the density, respectively, of said other 

portion or portions (22) is equal to the rate of compression, or the density, 
respectively, of the two ends (21).  

 
Product of the tobacco industry according to claim 9, characterised 
in that the rate of compression, or the density, respectively, of said other 

portion or portions (22) is different from the rate of compression, or the density, 
respectively, of the two ends (21). 
Product of the tobacco industry according to one of the claims 10 or 
11, characterised in that it is made up wholly or in part of expanded shreds of 

tobacco and/or of expanded tobacco ribs and/or of short shreds of tobacco. 
Product of the tobacco industry according to claim 12, characterised 
in that its measured compressibility is equivalent to the measured compressibility 

of a cigarette comprising a preponderant part of non-expanded shreds of 
leaf tobacco and not comprising said other compressed increased-density 

portion or portions.
