<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pipe (10, 40) and to a method for their manufacture and to a device (12, 120, 122, 158) for holding pipes (10, 40) for pipe connections which have at least one piece of pipe with rib-shaped pipe collars (26) between which sealing elements (36) can be inserted or which have an expanded region (74, 76). The proposal is that the piece (14, 40) of pipe should be clamped in a first fixed holding device (12, 120, 122, 158) and pressed against the first holding device (12, 120, 122, 158), starting from the edge of the piece (14) of pipe, by means of a second, movable holding device (16, 46, 48) which has a mandrel (18, 46) projecting into the piece (14) of pipe, the piece (14) of pipe being upset locally and a pipe collar (26, 52) being formed or the pipe (40) expanded. In this way, pipe collars (26, 52) which are variable in size and spacing and expanded portions (74, 76) can be formed retrospectively on pipes (10, 40). It is furthermore proposed to hold the pipes (10, 40) during working by means of holding jaws (120, 122, 158) which have a toothed profile (130).

<CLAIMS>
Use of a device for holding a pipe, having two
holding jaws (120, 122, 158), which are movable towards

one another and have openings or recesses (124, 126)
having a tooth-shaped profile (130) in such a way that

the teeth (138, 140, 154) are raised by a small amount
"x" relative to the tooth roots (134, 136), the tooth

flanks (142, 144) obtained as a result extending in the
circumferential direction along the surface of the

recess (124, 126), characterized by the use for holding
pipes when axial forces occur, the deeper-set tooth

roots (134, 136) of the profile (130) being larger than
or equal to the pipe outside diameter, and the teeth

(138, 140, 154) leaving an opening (124, 126) having a
smaller inside diameter than the pipe outside diameter.
Use of the device according to Claim 1 during
the integral forming of pipe collars.
Use of the device according to Claim 1 during
the widening of pipes.
