<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 
high-purity crystalline lactulose by crystallization of commercially 
available aqueous syrups. Lactulose, or 4-O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-D-fructofuranose, is a 
semisynthetic disaccharide, used in the form of syrup or of 
crystalline product on account of its laxative action, efficacy in 
the treatment of hepatic dysfunctions, in particular of portal 
systemic encephalopathy, and as a sweetener. Lactulose syrups that are now available on the market are generally 
not pure, but contain more or less large amounts of other 
carbohydrates, in particular galactose and lactose, and typically 
50% by weight of lactulose; from 5 to 8% by weight of galactose; 
from 3 to 5% by weight of lactose; from 5 to 10% by weight of other 
carbohydrates. As may be seen, the per cent amount of carbohydrates different from 
lactulose contained in the syrups of commerce is relatively high. The use of products containing other carbohydrates in addition to 
lactulose for the therapy of disorders requiring administration of 
lactulose alone, would be prejudicial and raise problems, e.g. in 
patients suffering from diabetes or requiring a diet without  
 
galactose. Therefore, as lactulose becomes ever more important in 
pharmaceutical practice, there is a need for an adequate 
purification of same from contaminating carbohydrates. As disclosed in U.S. patent No. 4,536,221, various processes known 
for lactulose purification are based on the crystallization from 
alcoholic solvents, usually ethanol. However, the lactulose crystals obtained from alcohols always 
contain a given amount of solvent, probably due to the formation of 
hydrogen bonds between the OH groups of sugar and the OH groups of 
the solvent, while the solvent residue cannot be completely removed 
even by prolonged dryings. The disadvantage of the crystallization from ethanol is not only 
that complex process are required for solvent residue elimination, 
but also that high operating costs are generally involved. Some processs for the direct recovery of lactulose from aqueous 
solutions based on the concentration of same by drying under vacuum, 
lyophilization, and spray-drying are also known. Some of them are mentioned below: 
the process disclosed in JP No. 61,104,800, which comprises 
concentrating an aqueous solution containing at least 60% lactulose, 
adding the concentrate with crystal seeds at from 60° to 110°C, 
kneading and pulverizing, thus affording a powder containing 
lactulose crystals;

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of crystalline lactulose having a 
content of carbohydrates different from lactulose lower than 1% and 

a purity higher than 98.5% from a commercial aqueous syrup having a 
lactulose content of from 50% to 70% by weight and a total content 

of carbohydrates different from lactulose of from 10% to 30% by 
weight, characterized in that the acqueous syrup is partially 

evaporated to sugar concentrations of from 70° to 80° Brix, the 
concentrated syrup is added with from 5% to 30% of crystalline 

trihydrated lactulose, the crystalline trihydrated lactulose which 
crystallizes from the syrup is separated and dried to a residual 

water content of 0.5% by weight. 
The process for the preparation of crystalline lactulose 
according to claim 1, characterized in that the commercial aqueous 

syrup has the following composition: from 50% to 70% by weight of 
lactulose; from 3 to 9% by weight of lactose; from 3 to 14% by 

weight of galactose; from 4 to 7% by weight of other carbohydrates. 
The process for the preparation of crystalline lactulose 
according to claim 1, comprising the following steps: 


a) said commercial lactulose aqueous syrup is evaporated under 
continuous stirring at a temperature of from 50° to 60°C and at a 

pressure of from 2660 to 6650 Pa, to a sugar concentration of 70°-80° 
Brix; 
b) the resulting concentrated syrup is cooled to from 5° to 20°C and 
added with crystalline trihydrated lactulose in an amount of from 5  

 
to 30 parts by weight of the lactulose present in the syrup; 
c) the suspension obtained is stirred at said temperature for a 
period of 20 to 120 hours and the lactulose present in the syrup 

crystallizes in the form of trihydrated lactulose; 
d) the crystallized trihydrated lactulose is separated by 
centrifuging or filtering from mother liquors, washed with cold 

water, and dried at a pressure of from 6650 to 13300 Pa, at a 
temperature of from 30° to 60°C, to yield crystalline lactulose 

having a water content below 0.5%. 
The process according to claim 3, wherein the concentrated syrup 
of step b) has a content of from 55% to 62% by weight of lactulose. 
The process according to claim 3, wherein the crystalline 
trihydrated lactulose is added in an amount ranging between 5 and 

15% of the lactulose present in the commercial syrup. 
The process according to claim 3, wherein the mother liquors 
resulting from the separation of crystalline trihydrated lactulose 

are passed once or several times through columns containing ion 
exchange resins to lower their content of carbohydrates different 

from lactulose within the aforesaid limits. 
The process according to claim 6, wherein the mother liquors, 
after treatment through said ion exchange resins, are mixed with the 

starting aqueous commercial syrup.
