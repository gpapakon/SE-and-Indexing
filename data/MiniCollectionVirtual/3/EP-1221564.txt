<ABSTRACT>
A transmission belt for a continuously variable transmission, comprising
transverse elements (5) and an endless carrier (9) for keeping together the transverse

elements (5), each transverse element (5) is provided with a rocking edge (12)
showing a curvature for allowing neighbouring transverse elements (5) to mutually tilt

about an substantially axially oriented contact line (7) over a tilting angle (α), so that a
part of the belt may pass along a longitudinally bent trajectory, According to the

invention the curvature of the rocking edge (12) is defined such that it notionally
displaces the contact line (7) in dependence on the tilting angle (α, β).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission belt for a continuously variable
transmission according to the preamble of claim 1. The present invention also relates
to a transmission and to a vehicle wherein such a transmission belt is applied.Such a transmission belt is generally known, e.g. from EP-A-0.522.612. The
elements in the known belt show a lower, or radially inner part that is tapered or is any
other way recessed with respect to an upper, or radially outer part. The radially outer
part of the elements shows a principal plane by which the elements transmit a pushing
force from one to the other in a pushing trajectory part of the belt when it crosses from
a first pulley to a second pulley of the transmission. A transition from this principal
plane to the recessed lower part is commonly referred to as a rocking edge. The
recessed lower part allows adjacent elements to mutually tilt about a contact line on
the rocking edge over a certain tilting angle, so that the belt may pass along a curved,
i.e. bent trajectory part between sheaves of a pulley of the continuously variable
transmission. In the known belt the rocking edge extends over the axial width of the
element and shows a curvature in the radial direction of the belt having a radius of
about 6 mm, which in the known automotive conforms to the radius of curvature that
develops as a stable value after initial, or run in wear of the element.The transmission realises a continuously variable speed ratio between the first
and the second pulley by varying a radius of the bent trajectory part for each of said
pulleys in a co-ordinated manner. The transmission is said to have a ratio coverage,
i.e. a measure for the range of speed ratios attainable by the transmission, which is
usually defined as the squared value of the quotient of a maximum and the minimum
radius of the said bent trajectory part, whereby said radii of the bent trajectory parts
are determined by the radial position of the contact line. A large ratio coverage is
advantageous for the efficiency of and driving comfort associated with a motor vehicle
in which the transmission is to be applied.The present invention aims at providing a transmission belt that realises an
improved, i.e. extended ratio coverage for a given transmission design, essentially
without sacrificing application capabilities of the transmission or the transmission belt.Such a belt is known from the Japanese patent publication JP-6-272737,
disclosing a rocking edge of magnified radius of curvature, transiting into
