<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an appliance (1) for cutting hair with a toothed cutting device (7) which exhibits a stationary cutter (10) with a series of cutting teeth (11) and a cutter (12) which can be driven back and forth and has a series of cutting teeth (13), the cutting teeth (11, 13) of at least one of the two cutters (10, 12) being of a rounded design at their free ends (31) apart from in the region of their running surfaces (15, 16). In the case of the appliance, the cutting teeth (11, 13) of the at least one cutter (10, 12) are additionally of a fully rounded design over the entire tooth depth as far as the tooth-root region (29), apart from in the region of their running surfaces (15, 16).

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (1) for cutting hair, having a toothed cutting device (7)
comprising a stationary cutter (10) with at least one row of cutter teeth (11) and a

reciprocatingly drivable cutter (12) with at least one row of cutter teeth (13), the cutter
teeth (13) having shearing faces (15, 16) and the two cutters (10, 12) being in

engagement with one another by at least a part of the shearing faces (15, 16) of their
cutter teeth (11, 13), and the cutter teeth (11, 13) of at least one of the two cutters (10,

12) being rounded at their distal ends (31) except for the area of their shearing faces
(15, 16), characterized in that the cutter teeth (11, 13) of at least one cutter (10, 12)

having cutter teeth which are rounded at their distal ends (31) except for the area of
their shearing faces (15, 16) are in addition wholly rounded over their entire tooth depth

into the proximal tooth areas (29) except for the area of their shearing faces (15, 16).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the cutter teeth
(11, 13) of both cutters (10, 12) are wholly rounded over their entire tooth depth into

the proximal tooth areas (29) except for the area of their shearing faces (15, 16).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that both
cutters (10, 12) are formed by punched metal parts and the cutter teeth (11, 13) are

rounded in an embossing process.
A method of manufacturing a cutter for a toothed cutting device of an
apparatus as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that an

unhardened steel strip (32) having a given strip thickness (D) is moved stepwise to a
follow-on tool arrangement and in that in a first follow-on step the steel strip (32) is

pre-embossed to form pre-embossed first cutter-tooth blanks (37) of a cutter, which pre-embossed
first cutter-tooth blanks (37) remain connected to one another by steel-strip

bridges (8) formed during pre-embossing and having a small bridge thickness (d) in
relation to the strip thickness (D), and in that subsequently in a second follow-on step

the strip-steel bridge (8) connecting the pre-embossed first cutter-tooth blanks (37) is cut
away in a cutting operation and at the same time second cutter-tooth blanks (43) of a

cutter are formed from the first cutter-tooth blanks (37), and in that subsequently in a 
third follow-on step the second cutter-tooth blanks (43) are post-embossed to produce

post-embossed third cutter-tooth blanks of a cutter, during which post-embossing the
third cutter-tooth blanks (48) are embossed so as to be wholly rounded over their entire

tooth depth from their distal ends (31) into the proximal tooth areas (29) except for the
areas intended for the formation of the shearing faces (15, 16) of the cutter teeth (11,

12).
A method as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that a steel-strip bridge
having a bridge thickness (d) equal to at the most 75 % of the strip thickness (D) is

formed during pre-embossing in the first follow-on step.
A method as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that a steel-strip bridge
having a bridge thickness (d) equal to at the most 30 % of the strip thickness (D) is

formed during pre-embossing in the first follow-on step.
A method as claimed in Claim 4, 5 or 6, characterized in that after the
third follow-on step in the follow-on tool arrangement the resulting cutter blank

including its third cutter-tooth blanks (48) is hardened in a further process step.
A method as claimed in Claim 4, 5, 6 or 7, characterized in that the third
cutter-tooth blanks (48) of a cutter are ground to form well-defined shearing faces (15,

16) and sharp cutting edges in the area intended for the formation of the shearing faces
(15, 16) of the cutter teeth (11, 13).
