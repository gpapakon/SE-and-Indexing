<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an exchangeable hard metal cutting insert
for use with a peripheral rotary milling cutter particularly, but not exclusively, for use
in milling slots, shoulders or the like, with the side milled surface disposed
substantially perpendicular to a milled base surface.One or more of such inserts are releasably mounted in corresponding
peripheral recesses formed in a rotary tool holder, each insert being
provided with at least one cutting edge which, when mounted in the tool
holder, is operatively disposed for milling operations. It is well known, with such rotary milling cutters, that it is
advantageous to position the or each insert in the cutter so as to present a
significantly large, positive axial rake angle.With known rotary milling cutters such as, for example that
described in our prior US Patent Specification Serial No. 5 158 402
which appears to be the closest prior art and which constitutes the basis for the
preamble of claim 1
increasing the axial rake angle of the operative cutting edge on the insert
involves providing a tool holder where the insert seat is sufficiently inclined
with respect to the rotary axis of the tool holder so that the cutting edge has the
required positive axial rake angle. It will be readily understood that
constructional considerations limit the degree of inclination of the support
seat in the tool holder, seeing that an excessively high inclination would of
necessity weaken the tool holder. Thus, with conventional rotary milling
cutters, an upper limit was always imposed on the magnitude of the axial
rake angle.It was with a view to overcoming this restriction that it was
proposed, for example in our prior US Patent Nos. 5 052 863 and
5 071 292, to provide the insert with a cutting edge which is inclined with X
respect to the base surface of the cutting insert. By so doing it is possible,
on the one hand, to achieve an increased positive axial rake angle and, on
the other hand, to maintain the insert support seat of the tool holder in a
more or less conventional inclination, thereby not leading to the structural
weakening of the tool holder. This solution, however, is limited by the size
of the insert. Thus, the angle of inclination of the cutting edge vis-à-vis
the base of the insert is a function of the ratio of the height of the insert to
the length of the cutting edge. Thus, the longer the cutting edge, any
increase in the angle of inclination of the cutting edge must be accompanied
by a corresponding increase in the height of the insert.

<CLAIMS>
A cutting insert for use with a peripheral rotary
milling cutting tool, having a cutting corner (19) and

an adjacent cutting edge defined between a cutting
rake surface (12) and a relief flank (13), and having

a base edge (20) defined between said relief flank and
a base surface, the cutting edge consisting of a

plurality of successive component cutting edges (17a,
17b, 17c) and intermediate edges (21) respectively

located between successive component cutting edges;
each component cutting edge having respective leading

and trailing extremities, each leading extremity other
than that of the first leading component cutting edge

(17a) merging with an immediately preceding trailing
extremity via one of said intermediate edges, and a

wiper edge (14) associated, via said insert corner
(19), with the leading extremity of the first of said

component cutting edges (17a), characterised in that
each component cutting edge is directed, from its

leading extremity, towards said base edge, and each
intermediate edge is directed, from said trailing

extremity, away from said base edge.

component cutting edges (17) are inclined with respect

to the base edge (20) of the insert by angles α which
are not less than 2°.
A cutting insert according to claim 2, wherein the
angle α lies in a range from 2° - 12°.
A cutting insert according to claim 2 or 3, wherein
the angle α lies in a range from 8° - 10°. 
A cutting insert according to any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said component cutting edges (17) are of

substantially equal length.
A cutting insert according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said intermediate cutting edges (21)

are directed away from said insert base at obtuse
exterior angles.

claims, wherein said component cutting edges (17) are

directed towards the insert base at substantially
equal acute angles.
A peripheral rotary milling cutting tool comprising a cutting
insert according to any one of the preceding claims.

wherein each normal to an axis of rotation of the

cutter tool which passes through a trailing extremity
of one component cutting edge (17), intersects the

successive component cutting edge (21) so that during
a milling operation, successive component cutting

edges (17) overlap.

9, wherein at least the leading extremities of the

component cutting edges (17) are designed to be on a
cylindrical envelope corresponding to an optimal

milling diameter.
