<ABSTRACT>
A system of treating teeth or associated tooth structure uses an abrasive-laden fluid. Fluid (101) at different selected pressures (103) is delivered to a device (105) for mixing the fluid with abrasive. The air/abrasive mix flows through a hand-held device (107) to the point of treatment. A selective control (107, 191) delivers air or air and abrasive as desired. Upon termination of an air/abrasive treatment, air is diverted through a purge line (214) to purge the system downstream from the abrasive device. A vacuum (221) removes abrasive and debris from the patient's mouth during and after the abrasive treatment. A hand-held nozzle device (107) has finger controlled fluid ports (194-197). A disposable collection chamber (232) for sterile disposal of the abrasive and debris has a common filter (233) for the purge circuit and the system for removal of abrasive and debris from the mouth. The existing dental office suction system or venturi may provide suction for the vacuum. Pressure regulating and relief valves insure instantaneous change from one pressure to another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
US-application Serial No. 07/859,158, filed
March 27, 1992.The present invention relates to systems used in
the practice of dentistry, and more particularly, to
systems for cutting, excavating and etching teeth or
associated tooth structure by means of finely divided
abrasive materials carried in a fluid stream.The use of abrasive-laden fluid streams to treat
teeth has long been known. For example, U.S. Patent
No. 2,661,537 to Angell describes equipment for
treating teeth with a relatively high-pressure stream
laden with abrasive particles. While the use of such
equipment has gained a significant degree of success in
connection with the cleaning of teeth, there has
heretofore been an overall lack of success in the
dental industry with respect to the use of such
equipment for cutting, excavating or etching teeth.
Applicant has found that this lack of success can be
attributed to several heretofore unrecognized
disadvantages associated with equipment of the type
described in Angell. For example, cutting or etching of teeth with
gas/abrasive streams frequently requires a source of
fluid at pressures of at least about 120 psig (1 psi absolute =
1 psi atm. + 1 psig; 1 psi absolute = 0,0689 bar).
Unfortunately, however, compressed air in the range of
about 60 to 80 psig is generally the highest pressure
available in dental operatories. In order to overcome
this limitation, the Angell patent describes the use of
cylinders containing CO2 gas at a pressure of about 800
psig as a source of pressurized fluid. Applicant has
found that there are numerous disadvantages associated
with the use of pressurized gas in this form. For
example, applicant has found that one important factor
in successfully achieving cutting, etching and/or
excavating tooth enamel is proper regulation and
control of the pressure at which such operations are
carried out. Such precise control and regulation is
difficult to achieve in the system described in Angel.
One reason for this difficulty is the very large
pressure differentials between the pressure needed to
operate the system (e.g. 100 to 120 psig) and the
pressure at which the gas is delivered (800 psig). In
particular, the accuracy of pressure regulation
equipment is frequently inversely proportional to the
pressure differential across the regulating device.
Thus, the precision of the regulated pressure
frequently decreases as the pressure differential
increases.Another disadvantage of the equipment described in
Angell is that it is
