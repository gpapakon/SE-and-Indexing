<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to semiconductor processing and more
specifically to BiCMOS processes.The integration of MOSFET structures and bipolar transistors on a
single substrate has become very desirable. As is well known in the art,
digital and linear functions are often performed by integrated circuits using
either bipolar or metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) technology. Bipolar
integrated circuits, of course provide higher speed operation and greater
drive currents than the MOS circuits, at the cost of higher power dissipation,
especially when compared against complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits.
Advances in manufacturing technology have allowed the use of both bipolar
and CMOS transistors in the same integrated circuit (commonly referred to
as BiCMOS devices). Further exploitation of the high current driving
capabilities of the bipolar transistor is important to obtaining even higher
levels of bipolar or merged bipolar CMOS integration.Bipolar transistors are typically formed by using a moat region for the
base of the bipolar transistor, doped polysilicon for the emitter, and a well
region for the collector. Additional moat regions are then used to form any
Schottky diodes or source/drain regions of PMOS transistors. In the proceedings of the IEEE Bipolar Circuits and
Technology Meeting, September 1990 (pages 78 to 81)
W. R. Burger et al. report on a complementary BiCMOS
(CBiCMOS) process offering improved drive capability and low
voltage performance by integration of a poly emitter
vertical PNP transistors into a core BiCMOS technology
containing NPN bipolar and CMOS transistors. Bipolar devices
are formed subsequently to NMOS and PMOS devices in the
wells over the buried layers used by the NMOS and the PMOS
circuit elements. The process features two electrode layers
and two underlying insulator layers.EP-A-0 436 297 shows a BiCMOS device with a structure in
which the inactive base of a bipolar transistor and the
drain of a CMOS transistor are formed by one doped region
and in which the collector of the bipolar transistor and the
source of the CMOS transistor are made contiguous.Other BiCMOS processes with integrated device modules like a
short key barrier diode or a lateral PNP transistor are
disclosed in JP-A-61136255 and in the Proceedings of the
IEEE 1990 Bipolar Circuits and Technology Meeting (pages 154
to 157) by Ali Iranmanesh et al. Generally, and in one form of the invention, a method for
forming a semiconductor device is defined in the claims. A first insulator
