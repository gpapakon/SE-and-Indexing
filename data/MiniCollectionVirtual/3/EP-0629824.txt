<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an evaporator for a compressor refrigerator which is fabricated from a two-layer evaporator blank, between which meandering refrigerant passages as well as an inlet and outlet area for supplying and drawing off the refrigerant are formed, having a suction tube which is connected to the outlet area and can be attached to a suction side of the compressor, and a capillary tube for feeding liquid refrigerant into the inlet area, which passes through the suction tube outside the evaporator and can be attached to a condenser. The characterising feature of the invention is the arrangement of a guide tube in which a capillary tube is inserted on the condenser side and a further capillary tube on the evaporator side in such a way as to be sealed off to the outside, and the capillary tube is connected to the inlet area via the further capillary tube.

An evaporator for a compressor-refrigerator produced from an 
evaporator plate (1) comprising two layers between which meander-like 

coolant channels and also an inlet and an outlet zone (3; 4) 
for the supply and removal of the refrigerant are constructed, 

the evaporator having a suction tube (10) which is connected to 
the outlet zone (4) and which can be connected to the suction 

side of the compressor, and a first capillary tube (12) which 
supplies liquid refrigerant to the inlet zone (3) and which can 

be connected to a liquefier,
 
characterized by
 
a second capillary tube (7) and the arrangement of a guide tube 

(8) in which the first capillary tube (12) is inserted outwardly 
sealed on the evaporator slide and the second capillary tube (7) 

is thus inserted on the liquefier side, while the first capillary 
tube (12) extends outwardly outside the evaporator plate (1) 

through the wall of the suction tube (10) or through the wall of 
an intermediate tube (11) adjoining the suction tube (10), and 

the second capillary tube (7) is connected to the inlet zone (3) 
via the first capillary tube (12). 
An evaporator according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the guide tube (8) is attached externally 

to the suction tube (10) or externally to the intermediate 
tube (11).  

 
An evaporator according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the outer end of the guide tube (8) extends 

in sealing-tight relationship through the suction tube (10) or 
the intermediate tube (11) and terminates in the outlet zone (4).
