<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fibrinogen
binding proteins in particular
the use of the proteins for the preparation
of agents for use in immunisation and for diagnostic purposes.Clumping of Staphylococcus aureus in plasma has
been suggested as a potential virulence factor.1-5 Several
mechanisms can be responsible for this aggregation. A
fibronectin-binding protein has been suggested to cause
aggregation of staphylococci in fibronectin at the concentration
found in sera.5,6 The presence of protein A
causes staphylococci to aggregate in normal human sera,
which frequently contain specific immunoglobulins directed
against staphylococcal antigens.7 Due to a high cell surface
hydrophobicity, many staphylococcal strains auto-aggregate
under isotonic conditions.8 It is believed that
clumping of staphylococci in fibrinogen is caused by the so
called clumping factor or fibrinogen-binding protein,
situated on the staphylococcal cell surface.1,9 Fibrinogen
has also been suggested to mediate adhesion of S. aureus to
cultured human endothelial cells10 and to catheters invitro and invivo.11,12 It has been disputed whether
clumping factor is distinct from coagulase1 or if it is a
cell-bound form of coagulase.13,14Staphylococcus aureus
coagulases can be grouped into eight different serotypes15
and the existence of multiple molecular forms of coagulases 
has been suggested,16 although most investigators believe
that lower molecular weight subspecies in coagulase preparations
are due to proteolytic degradation of a larger
protein.17 Staphylococcal coagulases have been shown to induce
polymerization of fibrinogen to fibrin by binding, and
thereby activating, prothrombin. The coagulase-prothrombin
complex causes the release of fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen
in a manner similar to that described for thrombin in
physiological blood clotting. 18 Fibrinogen precipitation
and network formation can also be induced non-enzymatically,
e.g. by exposing fibrinogen to various highly positively
charged molecules like protamine, which interacts
with specific negatively charged sites on the D-domain of
fibrinogen.19We have recently described staphylococcal components
that interact with fibrinogen and which can be purified
from S. aureus culture supernatants.13 These are an 87
kDa coagulase and a 19 kDa fibrinogen-binding protein. The
87 and 19 kDa fibrinogen-binding proteins are essentially
extracellular proteins, but can to some extent be found on
the staphylococcal cell surface. Thus, these proteins can
give rise to the clumping
