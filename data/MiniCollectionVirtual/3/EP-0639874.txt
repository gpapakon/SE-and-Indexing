<ABSTRACT>
A multi-array twin tube lamp assembly 
allows for increased luminous output in a compact 

volume. The lamp assembly comprises multiple twin 
tube lamps, each lamp having an electrode structure 

and independent discharge path. In one embodiment, 
the base may be modified to allow the multiple twin 

tube lamps to be assembled in closed proximity. 
Alternatively, the lampholders may be modified to 

allow the multiple twin tube lamps to be assembled 
in close proximity. The multi-array lamp 

arrangement may be operated at more than one 
discrete light level, with each lamp having its own 

separate voltage. Twin tube lamps may be connected 
electrically in parallel to essentially achieve 

extended lamp life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
folded discharge low pressure lamp such as a 
fluorescent lamp and, more particularly, to a 
compacted and segmented array of lamps for 
increasing the lumen output characteristics in a 
compacted volume. Lamps that use mercury along with an 
inert gas, such as Argon, as a means of converting 
ultra-violet energy into visible light are 
classified as low pressure fluorescent discharge 
lamps. One such family of lamps that are 
commercially available are called twin tube lamps 
and typically range in wattage from 5W to 50W. 
Double twin tube lamp types, generically called 
quads, are also commercially available and operate 
within the same range of wattage. However, since 
quad lamps are inherently higher voltage devices 
than linear or twin tube lamps of equivalent length, 
it may be difficult to start the device due to the 
length of the discharge path and the bends 
associated with the quad lamp. This longer 
discharge path imposes more difficult limitations on 
the ballasting because of the inherently higher 
ballast voltages needed. Additionally, existing 
quad lamps are difficult and more expensive to 
manufacture, particularly due to the additional need 
to join the glass lamp tubes. U.S. Patent 4,937,487 of Blaisdell et al 
discloses single bent lamp tubes used for an 
information display system for use as a picture  
 
element. The Blaisdell et al patent requires lamps 
of different colors and air flow openings in its 
assembly. While the lamp assembly of this patent 
serves well its desired needs, i.e., to change 
color, it has definite limitations with regard to 
increasing total lumen output and in fact does not 
even address the issue of increasing lumen output. It is therefore highly desirable and an 
object of the present invention to provide an 
alternative approach to the present quad concept 
which can offer the equivalent high lumen output 
with the compactness feature of the quad design and 
do so with the lower lamp operating voltages of twin 
tube lamps. The present invention has been developed 
to provide such a twin tube lamp arrangement, 
wherein the quad concept of higher light output 
values in a compact volume can be accomplished by 
assembling existing twin tube lamps in close 
proximity with each other. The present invention 
provides a low cost option to the quad design by 
mechanically and electrically connecting existing 
twin tube lamps, without the need to join glass, as 
the quad lamp design requires. Total lumen output 
can be
