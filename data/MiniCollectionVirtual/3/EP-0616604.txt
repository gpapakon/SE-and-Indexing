<ABSTRACT>
A device for separating one or more strands of molten glass into individual posts has a number of pairs of shearing blades corresponding to the number of strands to be separated, one blade of each pair being arranged on a first supporting arm and the other on a second arm and the arms being movable towards and away from each other, and a drive unit for the to and fro movements of the arms. In order to ensure complete simultaneity of the movement of the co-operating components of the device and high positioning precision, the drive unit has a bidirectionally operable crankshaft by which two crank journals mutually staggered by 180  can be moved, the first of which is operationally connected to the first supporting arm via a first connecting rod and the second to the second arm via a second connecting rod.

Device for separating one or more strands of molten
glass into individual gobs, the device having a number of

pairs of shearing blades (19, 20) corresponding to the
number of strands to be separated, one shearing blade (19)

of each pair of shearing blades (19, 20) being arranged on a
first supporting arm (18) and the other shearing blade (20)

of each pair of shearing blades (19, 20) being arranged on a
second supporting arm (21) and the supporting arms (18, 21)

being moveable towards one another and away from one
another, and the device having a drive unit for the movement

of the supporting arms (18, 21) towards one another and away
from one another, the drive unit having a crankshaft (1)

which can be driven in two directions and by means of which
two crank pins (3, 6), offset at 180 degrees to one another,

are moveable, of which the first (3) is drivingly connected
to the first supporting arm (18) 
via
 a first connecting rod
(4) and the second (6) is drivingly connected to the second

supporting arm (21) 
via
 a second connecting rod (7),
characterised in that each connecting rod (4, 7) is

connected at its end remote from the crank pin to an
operating element (11, 22) which moves linearly back and

forth with the cranking or rotating movement of the
connecting rod (4, 7) and which in turn is drivingly

connected to the corresponding supporting arm (18, 21).
Device according to claim 1, wherein the operating
element is in the form of a clamping strip (11, 12) which is

attachable to a rectilinearly guided rod arrangement (12,
12, 14, 15; 23, 24, 25, 26) connected at its end remote from

the clamping strip to the corresponding supporting arm (18,
21). 
Device according to claim 2, wherein the rod
arrangement has at least two rods or tubes which have two

bearings and which are arranged parallel with one another.
Device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein each rod (12)
is guided and held in a first bearing (16), which is

arranged on the side of the clamping strip (11) facing the
crankshaft (1), and in a second bearing (17), which is

arranged on the side of the clamping strip (11) remote from
the crankshaft (1), the distance between the first (16) and

the second bearing (17) in the direction of movement of the
clamping strip (11) being sufficient to permit any travel of

the clamping strip (11) necessary when operating and
maintaining the device.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the two crank pins (3, 6) are arranged on a crank disc (5)

arranged in a rotationally and axially secure manner
relative to the crankshaft (1).
Device according to claim 5, wherein each crank pin (3,
6) penetrates the connecting rod (4, 7) associated with it,

the first crank pin (3) being held at its end remote from
the crank disc on a first bearing disc (2) which is

connected to the crankshaft (1) in a rotationally and
axially secure manner and the second crank pin (6) being

held at its end remote from the crank disc on a second
bearing disc (8) which is connected in a rotationally and

axially secure manner to a bearing shaft (9) arranged in
alignment with the crankshaft (1), and the distance between

the crank disc (5) and the bearing discs (2, 8)
corresponding approximately to the dimension of the

connecting rods (4, 7) in the axial direction of the
crankshaft (1). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein a
servomotor is provided as the drive unit and is controlled

so that the speed of movement of the supporting arms (18,
21) reaches a maximum value when the strand is being cut.
