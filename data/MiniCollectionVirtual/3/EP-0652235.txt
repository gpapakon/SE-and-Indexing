<ABSTRACT>
A process for purifying a polymer by separating and 
removing volatile components from a polymer composition 

containing the volatile components is disclosed herein 
which comprises: 


(a) a step of heating the polymer composition 
containing a solvent such as methanol to a temperature of 

120-270°C; 
(b) a step of discharging the polymer composition 
into a tank in which a predetermined pressure is maintained, 

and then separating and collecting most of the 
volatile components from the composition; and 
(c) a step of feeding the obtained polymer composition 
to a vent extruder in which a predetermined temperature 

is set and pressure in a vent portion is set to a 
predetermined pressure, and then extruding it to lower the 

content of the remaining volatile components in the composition 
to 1% by weight or less. Alternatively, if necessary, 

between the above-mentioned steps (b) and (c), there 
can be interposed a step (b') of introducing an inert gas 

into the polymer composition before heating or under heating, 
or into the vicinity of the polymer composition which 

is being discharged into the tank. According to this 
process, the polymer can easily be separated and purified, 

so that the high-quality polymer, particularly the methyl 
methacrylate polymer can efficiently be manufactured without 

involving modification such as coloring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
purifying a polymer, and more specifically, it relates to a 
process for purifying a polymer by efficiently removing 
volatile components such as unreacted monomers and a solvent 
from a polymer composition obtained by a solution 
polymerization process or the like. In recent years, methacrylate polymers having 
excellent characteristics in points of transparency, 
weathering resistance and surface gloss have widely been 
used in various applications such as car parts, light 
electric parts, optical materials, and materials for 
lights, signs and displays. Heretofore, usually as a 
manufacturing method for methacrylic resin molding materials, 
a suspension polymerization method has been used, but 
this method inconveniently involves some problems such as 
the contamination of a polymer and the complication of a 
washing step and a waste water treatment step. Accordingly, 
much attention has nowadays been paid to a solution 
polymerization method as an excellent process from the 
viewpoints of economy and product quality. In this solution polymerization method, a devolatilization 
step is essential where volatile components 
such as unreacted monomers and a solvent which remain in a  
 
polymerization solution are removed after the completion of 
the polymerization. In such a method for removing the 
volatile components from the polymer composition, the 
polymer composition is generally heated to a high temperature, 
and then introduced into a vacuum atmosphere to 
evaporate and separate the volatile components therefrom. 
This method is suitable for mass production on an industrial 
scale, because it permits the treatment of a large 
amount of the polymer composition at once. As one example of this method, Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 29797/1978 has reported a method which 
comprises heating a polymer solution by the use of a multitubular 
type heat exchanger, and then flushing the heated 
solution with bubbles into a devolatilizing tank in which 
pressure is reduced, thereby removing volatile components 
therefrom. In this method, it is necessary that the polymer 
composition is beforehand sufficiently heated for the 
purpose of lowering the concentration of the remaining 
volatile components in the obtained polymer. Furthermore, 
the polymer composition flushed into the devolatilizing 
tank foams due to the evaporation of the volatile components, 
and at this time, owing to cooling by evaporation 
latent heat, the viscosity of the polymer composition
