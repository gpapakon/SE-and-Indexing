<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multilayer, readily thermoformable film, having the sequence arrangement ABCD, in particular for packaging objects with sharp edges, where   - the sequence A comprises at least one copolyamide based on caprolactam and/or a mixture of an aliphatic polyamide with copolyamide based on caprolactam, and/or amorphous polyamide, - the sequence B contains at least one layer of olefinic (co)polymers, - the sequence C contains at least one layer of copolyamide based on caprolactam and/or a mixture of an aliphatic polyamide with a copolyamide based on caprolactam, and/or an aromatic polyamide, and the C:A thickness ratio is from 1.5 to 4, - the sequence D contains at least one layer of olefinic (co)polymers which, as outer layer, comprises a heat-sealable material, and the thicknesses are in the D:B ratio of from 3 to 10, preferably from 4 to 7.

<CLAIMS>
Multi-layer, readily thermoformable, unoriented film 
having the sequential arrangement ABCD, in particular 

for packaging sharp-edged goods, characterised in that 

sequence A consists of at least one copolyamide 
based on caprolactam or of a blend of aliphatic 

polyamide with copolyamide based on caprolactam 
or of amorphous polyamide, 
sequence B contains at least one layer of 
olefinic (co)polymers, 
sequence C contains one or more layers containing 
a copolyamide based on caprolactam or a blend of 

an aliphatic polyamide with a copolyamide based 
on caprolactam or an aromatic polyamide and the 

ratio of thicknesses of C:A is 1.5-4, 
sequence D contains at least one layer of 
olefinic (co)polymers, which as the outermost 

layer consists of a heat sealing material, and 
that the thicknesses are in the ratio of D:B of 

3-10, preferably of 4-7. 
Film according to claim 1, characterised in that 
sequence C has a thickness of 30 to 150 µm, preferably 

of 50 to 100 µm. 
Film according to claims 1 to 2, characterised in that 
sequence D has a thickness of 100 to 250 µm, 

preferably of 150 to 200 µm.  
 
Film according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
sequence B contains an acid-modified polyolefin which 

acts as a coupling agent for sequences A and C. 
Film according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the film structure ABCD or one or more of sequences A, 

B, C and D is produced by coextrusion or adhesive 
lamination or extrusion coating or extrusion 

lamination. 
Film according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the heat sealing material in sequence D is 

polyethylene or ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer or 
ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer or ethylene/methylene 

acrylic acid copolymer or ionomer. 
Film according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the side of the film facing away from the heat sealing 

layer and/or at least one further layer is printed. 
Film according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in that 
the film is used for packaging sharp-edged foodstuffs.
