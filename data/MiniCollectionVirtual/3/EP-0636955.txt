<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 
control unit for vehicle where increase in number of 

input/output and upgrading of function can easily be 
performed and, in addition to this, changing of a program 

in a control unit can easily be performed even when a 
single-chip micro-computer is used. 
In order to cope with an increase in input/output 
points and addition of function, a control unit is 

constructed such as to comprise interface software memory 
means storing an interface software program for connecting 

an application software program with an OS (operating 
system) in an internal ROM, a CPU (central processing 

unit) for performing computation of the application 
software program and the interface software program, a RAM 

(erasable memory) storing data such as the result of 
computation, an I/O unit for extending the control unit, 

and extending means for communicating memory data through 
a bus or a LAN. 
A single-chip micro-computer used in vehicle control 
can easily cope with increase in input/output points or 

addition of function, and an application software program 
can continuously be used only by rewriting an interface 

software program, and further re-manufacturing of a core 
unit is unnecessary. Therefore, development of a control 

unit including programs becomes easy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control unit for
vehicle, and more
particularly but not exclusively to a control unit for vehicle
whereby to control the engine,
transmission, brake, electronic throttle, suspension and
the like.In recent years, a control unit mounting a single-chip
micro-computer is used in vehicle control. The
single-chip micro-computer incorporates memories (ROM, RAM
and so on) required by calculation of the central
processing unit (CPU). Therefore, there is an advantage in
that the control unit can be miniaturized as a whole,
being easy in use and high in processing speed.However, the conventional technology has an
disadvantage in that expanding of the control unit is
considerably limited when the software and/or hardware
happen to be changed due to change in the control
specification. Further there is a disadvantage in that the
software program needs to be made under a limitation of
the hardware when a single-chip micro-computer is used in 
vehicle control, and especially whenever fuel cost or cleaning
of engine emissions is to be improved, increase in number of
input/output and upgrading of function are indispensable and
all the hardware and softwear needs to be renewed.Furthermore, since the control software program for
performing various control written in the ROM is represented
in an assembler language, the contents and the production
technique of the program cannot be understood except by an
expert in the field. Therefore, no person except an initial
programmer actually participating in the production stage of
the application software program can understand the detailed
contents of the software program. When there is need to add
another function to the application software program, the
program is required to be re-written.Elektronik vol. 39, No. 6, 16th March, 1990, pages 61 -
