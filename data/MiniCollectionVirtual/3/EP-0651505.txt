<ABSTRACT>
A variable frequency digital ring oscillator which can be 
formed in a small area for use in testing of chips employs a 

ring oscillator formed of CMOS inverters (6), transmission gates (3,5) 
and capacitors (4,7) and CMOS logic as a voltage controlled ring 

oscillator. A wide range of frequency of oscillation is 
achieved with small number of components. The ring oscillator 

circuit's oscillator frequency is controlled only by DC 
voltages (V
p
,V
n
) 
such as may be provided by (but not limited to) a 

manufacturing chip tester. The output signal of the oscillator 
swings between Vdd and Vss and does not need additional level 

translation circuits to drive CMOS logic. The ring oscillator 
can be composed of an odd number of CMOS inverters connected in 

cascade to form a loop. We provide a CMOS transmission gate 
with PMOS and NMOS transistor device inserted between each 

adjacent inverter and a MOS capacitor connected between the 
output of each transmission gate and the Vss supply of the 

ring oscillator circuit (conventionally ground). The gate 
voltages of the PMOS and NMOS transistors in the transmission 

gate are different and provide a different DC voltage between 
Vdd and Vss. Variation of the gate voltages of the transmission 

gates controls the frequency of oscillation of the circuit. The 
use of a plurality of cascaded delay elements between inverters 

achieves a wider range of oscillation frequency than possible 
with a single delay element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a voltage controlled programmable 
digital oscillator and particularly to a voltage controlled 
programmable digital oscillator fabricated on a CMOS integrated 
circuit chip, suitable for use as part of a larger system on 
such a chip such as on-chip clock generation, phase locked 
loop, or on chip test clock generation. As background for our invention, United States Patent 
4,617,529, issued October 14, 1986, to A. Suzuki shows a ring 
oscillator composed of CMOS inverters coupled in cascade with a 
RC delay element inserted between adjacent inverters. However, 
this prior art uses a fixed delay element and has no other 
means of variability, making it unusable as a voltage 
controlled oscillator. In addition, we would note that there are patents of which we 
are aware which are listed below with a brief discussion of 
each of the patents. United States Patent 4,859,970, issued August 22,1989 to Matsuo 
et al. and assigned to Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba, shows a 
Voltage Controlled Oscillator, one element of which is a 
voltage controlled delay element comprising CMOS transmission 
gates connected between adjacent CMOS inverters. The gates of 
each of the PMOS and NMOS transistors of each transmission gate 
is connected to a variable control voltage which is used to 
vary the delay. This circuit does not have a MOS capacitor on 
the output of the transmission gate structure but uses the 
parasitic capacitance of the devices and the inverter gates to 
form the capacitance of the RC delay element needed. This 
circuit is not an oscillator but requires a phase comparator 
and other elements of a phase locked loop to generate a stable 
oscillation.  United States Patent 4,517,532, issued May 14, 1985 to 
R.A.Neidorff and assigned to Motorola, Inc shows a ring 
oscillator composed of a plurality of inverting gates connected 
in a loop configuration which has a bypass mechanism which is 
used to alter the frequency of oscillation. This circuit may be 
varied in discrete steps only and has no voltage control nor 
continuous variability. It preferred embodiment is bipolar I2L 
and not CMOS. United States Patent 4,884,041, issued November 28, 1989 to 
R.C.Walker and assigned to the Hewlett-Packard Company, shows a 
ring oscillator which may be integrated on chip comprising an N 
element ring oscillator merged with an M element ring 
oscillator by using a linear combining circuit. Variation of 
the control voltage allows variation of the oscillator 
frequency by varying the proportion
