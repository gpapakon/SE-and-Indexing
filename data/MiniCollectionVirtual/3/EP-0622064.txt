<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article (10) is disclosed having a 
liquid-permeable cover (12), an absorbent (17), a 

liquid-impermeable foam baffle (20), and a layer of hot melt 
adhesive (19) bonding the absorbent (17) to the foam baffle 

(20). The baffle (20) is a polyolefin foam having a 
thickness ranging from about 0.51 millimeters to about 1.54 

millimeters and having a density ranging from about 0.0225 
g/cm³ to about 0.0962 g/cm³.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an absorbent article. Disposable absorbent articles, such as sanitary napkins 
catamenial pads, panty liners, training pants, incontinent 
garments, diapers, and the like are designed to be worn 
adjacent to a human body to absorb discharged body liquids. 
Conventionally, disposable absorbent articles comprise an 
absorbent pad positioned between a liquid-permeable nonwoven 
top sheet and a liquid-impermeable back sheet. The nonwoven 
top sheet draws the waste away from the contacting skin and 
into the absorbent core while the liquid impermeable back 
sheet prevents the absorbed liquids from leaking out of the 
absorbent article. Numerous variations of, and elements in 
addition to, these basic components have been taught with 
each variation or additional element being directed to 
improving specific characteristics of the article. 
Regardless of the particular construction, however, it is 
expected that the absorbent article will have characteristics 
which permit liquid to penetrate the liquid-permeable top 
sheet while quantities of liquid are absorbed by the core. The body fluid which penetrates the thickness of the core 
will be prevented from wetting the surrounding undergarment 
by a liquid- impermeable baffle. Usually, the baffle is a 
polyethylene film having a thickness of about .025 to .13 
millimeters (about .001 to about .005 of an inch). 
Optionally, the absorbent article may provide for a pressure 
sensitive adhesive applied to the garment facing side of the 
baffle. The adhesive is of the type that is capable of 
securing the absorbent article to the crotch portion of an 
undergarment, yet permitting removal of the article when 
soiled.  For convenience in the description, a panty liner or a very 
thin absorbent pad used primarily for feminine hygiene, which 
may be used for undergarment protection between menstrual 
periods as well as absorbing light flow between and during 
periods will be described herein. However, it is to be 
understood that this preferred embodiment of this invention 
is not limiting the invention only to panty liners. Heretofore, in constructing a panty liner, some means was 
provided for holding the fibers constructing the absorbent 
core together to form a layer so the laminate does not fall 
apart and/or for bonding the layer of fibers to adjoining 
layers. Several approaches have been taken in the prior art. One 
technique is to seal the fibers within an envelope. The 
envelope is formed by sealing or adhesively attaching the 
cover
