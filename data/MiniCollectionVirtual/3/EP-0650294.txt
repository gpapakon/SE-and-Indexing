<ABSTRACT>
Background

 
It is very important that the driver circuit provides a 

sufficient base current to the power transistor because 
otherwise said power transistor might come out of saturation 

and can be damaged. In praxis it can occur that the charging 
capacitor providing operating current for the driver circuit 

has no sufficient charge to ensure required base current for 
the power transistor. 
Gist of the invention

 
It is an object to ensure that in all modes like switching from 

OFF to ON or from Standby to ON or during operation of a 
protecting circuit a sufficient base current for the power 

transistor is provided. According to the invention circuit 
means are provided ensuring that after switching the supply 

from OFF mode or from Standby mode to normal ON mode said 
charging capacitor (CP05) is fully charged before said 

switching voltage (Us) appears at the base of said power 
transistor (TP10). Especially said charging capacitor (CP05) is 

continuously charged during Standby mode or a delay circuit is 
provided for introducing a delay time between switching ON the 

circuit and the occurrence of the switching voltage (Us) at the 
base of said power transistor (TP10). 
Advantages

 
It is ensured that in all different modes like switching from 

ON to Standby or from Standby to ON or during protection 
operation or during repeatedly switching between ON an OFF 

sufficient base current for the power transistor is provided 
and there is no danger that the power transistor is damaged by 

insufficient saturation

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a switch mode power supply circuit according to the introductory part
of claim 1. Such circuits generally are used in TV receivers and video recorders.A first example of a known switch mode power supply is described in a German patent
application DE 37 20 600 further referred to as D2.In D2 is described a self oscillating switch mode power supply. A power switching transistor
TR1 has a control electrode which is fed through a relay RL 12 having two positions. In a first
position al the base receives a current from a current supply 8. In a second position b1, the
current that may fed the base, for instance from a rectified AC regulator 1 is dropped through
an absorbing circuit. Regulation system is provided to deliver power supply according to the
need of a load 7.A second example of such a known switched mode power supply which is nearer from the
present invention is described in EP patent application EP 0525 652 A12 further referred to as
D1.The power supply described in Dl comprises a power transistor TP29; having a control
electrode connected via a base network, to a control circuit 20.When first coupled to an AC mains 22, supply for control circuit 20 is provided by a start-up
current supply from a capacitor CP 28 coupled to an unregulated voltage Vin coming from a
bridge rectifier 24.The energy of control circuit 20 is then provided by capacitor CP28, the value of which is
320ÂµF.Said power supply of Dl is under control of a microprocessor 82 used, among other, to switch
the power supply between ON and STAND BY mode.The circuit of D7 is characterised by having a capacitor CP 24, to sweep out the base charge
in power transistor TP20 at the trailing edge of a pulse.This is important to prevent power transistor TP29 from heating and also to have a better
regulation of the delivered power supply.Within circuits of this art the following requirement does also exist. To ensure that said power
transistor is fully turned on, the current flowing into the base must be sufficiently large. Said
charging capacitor acts as a reservoir of charges to supply the necessary base current. That
means most current for the control of said power transistor is sourced from said charging 
capacitor. Hence, the charges stored in this charging capacitor are vital for the reliability of
the power supply. Insufficient charge will result in insufficient base current, said power
transistor will not be in the saturation region resulting in reduced reliability and at times
immediate destruction. With respect
