<ABSTRACT>
A liquid filter (10) for diesel fuel is proposed, in which an electrical heating device (34) and a manually operated auxiliary pump (33) are arranged in a housing module (17) on which the fluid and electrical connections (35, 37, 38) are also formed. The housing module (17) can be attached to a metal fixing flange (16), on the other side of which a box filter (12) can be fixed. The housing module (17) has a cylindrical plastic housing (39), in which the PTC heating elements (55, 56) are arranged between contact discs (53, 54) and the outer front face (42) of which is completely covered over by the pump diaphragm (46). The integrated construction is cost-effective and space-saving.

Liquid filter for diesel fuel, in which a filtering 
device (12) is fitted releasably and leaktightly to 

a filter head (11), which filtering device (12) accommodates 
a filter element (14) in a filter housing (13) and 

can be connected, with its openings assigned to the dirty 
and the clean side in one end, between an inlet connection 

(37) and an outlet connection (38) in the filter 
head (11), and a hand pump (33) and an electric heating 

device (34) with an associated electrical connection (35) 
being arranged in the filter head (11) and fixing means 

(19) for mounting the liquid filter (10) on an engine 
component being formed on it, characterized in that the 

filter head (11) comprises a fixing flange (16), the 
latter having the fixing means (19), and a housing module 

(17) mounted on the said flange, in that the heating 
device (34), the hand pump (33), the inlet connection 

(37), the outlet connection (38) and the electrical 
connection (35) are arranged in the housing module (17) 

and in that the filtering device (12) and the housing 
module (17) are mounted independently of one another on 

opposite sides of the fixing flange (16) in such a way 
that they are releasable and form the liquid connections, 

the housing module (17) having an essentially cylindrical 
housing (39), at the end (42) of which that is remote 

from the filtering device (12) the hand pump (33) with 
the diaphragm (46) is arranged, while the housing (39) is 

mounted by its other end on the fixing flange (16) via a 
plug-in connection comprising a plug connector (32) and 

the mating socket connector (31), and in that the fluid  
 

and electrical connections (37, 38, 35) are arranged 
radially on the cylindrical housing (39). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the outside diameter of the cylindrical housing 

(39) is significantly smaller than the outside diameter 
of the filter housing (13). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the fixing flange (16) is composed of 

metal, in particular aluminium, and the housing (39) of 
the module (17) is composed of plastic. 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that an air outlet device (36) is 

arranged in the housing module (17). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the air outlet device (36) has a float (63) which 

opens and closes an air outlet passage (62) as a function 
of a liquid level in the filter (10). 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the diaphragm (46) of the hand pump 

(33) seals off a liquid-filled space (43) from the 
outside and spans essentially the entire end (42) of the 

housing (39). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that inlet and discharge valves (51, 52) assigned to 

the hand pump (33) are arranged in the housing (39) in a 
dividing wall (41) situated between the two ends of the 

latter, of which valves the inlet valve (51) is assigned 
to an inlet space (45) and the discharge valve (52) is 

assigned to a heating space (44). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that a plurality of PTC heating elements (55, 56) 

assigned to the heating device (34) are held in the 
heating space (44) in the axial direction between two 

metallic contact washers (53, 54) which are in effective 
connection with the electrical connections (35), while, 

to hold them in the radial direction, webs (58) which 
hold the heating elements (55, 56) at the periphery are 

provided, the said webs emanating from a supporting plate 
(59) arranged in a manner fixed relative to the housing  

 
and passing axially through at least one of the contact 

washers (53, 54). 
Liquid filter according to one or more of Claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that the inlet connection (37), 

the outlet connection (38) and the electrical connection 
(35) are arranged in the housing module (17) in the same 

plane, which extends radially to the longitudinal axis of 
the filter (10) and, in particular, lies essentially 

centrally between the two ends of the housing (39). 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the filtering device (12) is fixed 

releasably on the fixing flange (16) with the aid of a 
screw collar ring (15) placed over the filter housing 

(13). 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the filtering device is designed as 

a box filter (12) which is sealed off by means of two 
radially acting sealing rings (24, 27) on two tubular 

stubs (22, 23) arranged concentrically on the fixing 
flange (16).
