<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for preparing products by removal of a solid
frozen solvent from a frozen matrix mixture.Freeze-drying, i.e., lyophilization, is a well known method of drying heat-sensitive
materials in order to protect them from thermal damage. In the past, preparations
containing active ingredients, such as pharmaceuticals, nutrients, diagnostics, fertilizers
and insecticides, have been prepared by freeze-drying aqueous solutions or suspensions
containing these bioactive ingredients. Conventional methods of freeze drying or
lyophilization involve the freezing of a material at a very low temperature followed by a
dehydration by sublimation under high vacuum.One problem that has arisen, however, with the use of conventional freeze-drying
processes is cracking of the freeze-dried preparations. Typically, cracking is caused by
the stresses set up during ice crystallization. Though cracking is never desirable, it is
especially undesirable where drop methods of freezing are employed. In such cases,
cracking of the frozen droplets usually results in unusable and inelegant remnants of
fractured droplets.Another problem encountered by use of known freeze-drying methods is a phenomenon
called meltback. Meltback occurs when the heat required during the drying process melts
the frozen material. As such, meltback defeats the whole purpose of freeze-drying-the
removal of water through sublimation as opposed to evaporation. To avoid meltback in
conventional freeze-drying methods, only limited amounts of material of limited
thickness can be dried at one time or, alternatively, very low temperatures have to be
used, thereby considerably extending the time required for sublimation. Even with these
limitations, conventional freeze-drying methods are not always sufficient to prevent
meltback.Yet another problem inherent in conventional freeze-drying methods is a lack of
resistance to disintegration in freeze-dried materials, i.e., they have little strength. Freeze-drying methods generally yield products that
merely crumble when handled. Various freeze-drying and
packaging methods have been employed in attempts to
circumvent this problem. For example, U.S. Patent No.
4,305,502 describes a method for forming a shaped
article by a lyophilization process in a depression in a
sheet of film material. However, such packaging
techniques do not avoid the problems posed by
conventional freeze-drying methods; the tablets are
still susceptible to crumbling if transferred to other
packaging.In the area of
