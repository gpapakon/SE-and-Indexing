<ABSTRACT>
A system for automatically identifying the desired concentrate to water ratio of a juice product in a concentrate container (10) inserted into a juice dispenser (12) and for automatically switching the ratio control system to the desired ratio. The system includes a product ratio I.D. member having ratio indicia on the fill plug of the container (10) and a sensor (16) in the dispenser. The sensed information is used by the ratio control system in the dispenser to change the pump motor speed to provide the desired ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
PRODUCT RATIO roENT-LFICATION SYSTEM FOR BEVERAGE DISPENSERCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/843,757 filed February 28, 1992, which was a continuation of U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/752,406 filed August 30, 1991.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field Of The InventionThis invention relates to postmix beverage dispensers and in particular to a system for automatically identifying the desired concentrate to water mixing ratio of the product in a juice concentrate container loaded into the dispenser.2. Description Of The Prior ArtPostmix juice dispensers are well-known for mixing together a quantity of juice concentrate and water to produce a beverage. Different juice concentrates are mixed with water at different ratios. When changing from one concentrate to another that requires a different ratio, changes must be made in the dispenser to change the ratio. Different dispensers use different systems to achieve the desired ratio and also to change the desired ratio. One known system, where the ratio is controlled by the speed of a motor that drives a concentrate pump, requires the operator to manually actuate a switch. If this is not done, or is done incorrectly, then the beverage is dispensed at the wrong ratio and the beverage quality is not satisfactory.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention overcomes the problems in the prior art caused by the requirement for a manual operation to change ratio, and provides a system for automatically identifying which of several different juice concentrates are in a concentrate container loaded into a beverage dispenser and for automatically switching the ratio control system in the dispenser to a different ratio. This system includes a product ratio I.D. (identification) member on the bottom of each concentrate container and a product ratio I.D. sensor in each container receiving chamber in the beverage dispenser. When a container is inserted into the chamber, the sensor automatically identifies the product ratio through the information on the I.D. member. This identification is then automatically used by the ratio control system of the dispenser to provide the proper ratio and thus a proper beverage, without the need for any manual operation. Throughout the present patent application, as will be readily understood by anyone skilled in this art, the phrase "identify the product ratio" shall mean "identify the desired concentrate to water mixing ratio for the product". 

 BRIEF
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. Apparatus for automatically identifying the product ratio of a product in a concentrate container inserted into a postmix beverage dispenser comprising:
(a) a postmix beverage dispenser;
(b) said beverage dispenser including a concentrate container-receiving chamber;
(c) a product ratio I.D. sensor located in said chamber;
(d) a concentrate container located in said chamber, said container including product ratio indicia thereon;
(e) said dispenser including means for receiving and supporting said container in said chamber in a single orientation of said container; and
(f) said product ratio indicia on said container being located on said container in a position such that when said container is in said single orientation in said chamber, said indicia is adjacent to said sensor.
2. The apparatus as recited in claim 1 wherein said container includes a fill plug and wherein said indicia are on said fill plug.
3. The apparatus as recited in claim 2 wherein said sensor includes a pair of Hall effect sensors mounted in said chamber.
4. The apparatus as recited in claim 3 wherein said sensor includes a pair of spring-biased, two-position, rocker members in tandem, each having a sensor arm and a contact arm and having a magnet in said sensor arm, and said each of said magnets being adjacent a respective one of said Hall effect sensors when said rocker members are in a first position.
5. The apparatus as recited in claim 4 in which said indicia are tabs extending from said fill plug adapted to selectively contact one or both of said contact arms of said rocker members.
6. The apparatus as recited in claim 1 wherein said dispenser includes means for automatically switching the mixing ratio of the dispensed beverage in response to the sensed desired product ratio.
7. The apparatus as recited in claim 6 wherein said automatic switching means includes a concentrate pump motor and means for changing the motor speed. 


 8. An article comprising:
(a) a juice concentrate container;
(b) said container including a fill plug; and
(c) said fill plug including product ratio I.D. indicia thereon.
9. The article as recited in claim 8 wherein said indicia includes a tab extending outwardly from said fill plug.
