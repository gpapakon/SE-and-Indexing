<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to Acetobacter sp. strain BPR
2001, a plasmid named pAH4 carried by said strain and
shuttle vectors constructed from said plasmid and an E.coli-derived
plasmid.Microorganisms belonging to Acetobacter xylinum have
been long known as acetic acid bacteria that produce
bacterial cellulose. Recently, bacterial cellulose produced
by acetic acid bacteria including Acetobacter xylinum has
received attention as material for, for example, medical
pads or loudspeaker diaphragms because its cellulose
microfibrils are more uniformly oriented as compared with
plant-derived cellulose so that it is homogeneous and
mechanically strong.However, the cellulose productivity of acetic acid
bacteria is low. Therefore, some attempts were made to
improve the productivity by varying incubation conditions or
introducing mutation. In addition to these conventional
means, the modern recombinant gene technology is also being
applied in the studies to improve the productivity. In order
to bring about gene recombination in cellulose-producing
acetic acid bacteria, it is necessary to develop, first of
all, a host-vector system for the object bacterium. It has been known that such microorganisms produce not
only cellulose but also acetan which is a water-soluble
polysaccharide. In view of the utility of acetan as starting
material for food-based thickeners and various chemical
products, it is also useful to develop such a host-vector
system. Seven vector plasmids carried by Acetobacter aceti
subsp. xylinum IFO 3288 were already reported (JPA1-199580).Plasmids carried by acetic acid bacteria were also
reported in JPW4-503456 and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol.
87, pp. 8130-8134 (1990).On the other hand, it would be very convenient for
gene recombination of acetic acid bacterial plasmids, if
plasmid vectors which can replicate not only in acetic acid
bacteria but also other host cells such as E.coli
(hereinafter referred to as "shuttle vectors") are
available.Such shuttle vectors were previously reported in, for
example, JPA1-199580 cited above and BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS,
Vol. 14, No. 7 (July, 1922), pp. 539-542.In this state of arts, the present inventors have
studied to provide a plasmid derived from a novel cellulose-producing
acetic acid bacterium and novel shuttle vectors
constructed from said plasmid and an E.coli-derived plasmid,
and succeeded in newly isolating a cellulose-producing
bacterium, which was classified as an Acetobacter according
to the method described in Bergey's Manual of Systematic
Bacteriolog
