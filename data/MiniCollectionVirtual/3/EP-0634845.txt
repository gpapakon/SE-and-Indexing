<ABSTRACT>
A signal processor such as an ADPCM decoder (128b) 
receives an input signal. As part of the CCITT Recommendation 

G.726 algorithm, an inverse adaptive quantizer (41) processes the 
input signal to provide a quantized difference signal d
q
(k). When 
enabled, a noise detector (50) samples signal d
q
(k) once for each 
of a predetermined number of received samples. The noise 

detector (50) adds the absolute value of signal d
q
(k) to a total 
energy estimate. At the end of the predetermined number of 

samples, the noise detector (50) compares the total energy 
estimate to a product of a noise threshold and the predetermined 

number. If the total energy estimate exceeds this product, then a 
noise indication is provided. In another embodiment (228b) a 

noise detector (250) compares an existing energy estimate signal 
d
ml
(k) computed by an adaptation speed control block (48) as part 
of the G.726 algorithm to an energy threshold to save processing 

time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to signal processors, and 
more particularly, to signal processors with noise burst detection 
and related methods. The increased density and reduced cost of integrated circuit 
components has made many previously impractical products 
commercially viable. One type of product made viable by advances 
in integrated circuit technology is the digital cordless telephone. 
A digital cordless telephone handset receives an analog speech 
signal via a microphone, converts the analog speech signal into a 
digital speech signal, compresses the digital speech signal, 
modulates the compressed signal at a radio frequency (RF), and 
transmits the modulated RF signal through an antenna. The 
transmitted RF signal is received by a nearby base station where 
it may be converted to an analog signal (or remain in digital form 
for digital switching equipment), and ultimately relayed to the 
destination telephone. When a similar signal is received from the 
destination telephone, the telephone signal undergoes the same 
process in reverse. The base station transmits a digital RF signal 
to the handset which is received via the antenna, demodulated, 
decompressed, and converted into an analog speech signal which 
drives a speaker in the handset. One standard for the operation of a cordless telephone 
handset is the U.K. Cordless Telephone, Second Generation (CT-2) 
standard. A CT-2 handset receives an analog voice signal from a 
microphone. The voice signal is converted to digital pulse code 
modulation (PCM) format, processed through an adaptive 
differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) encoder, and then 
modulated and transmitted according to the CT-2 Common Air 
Interface (CAI) protocol to a base station. CT-2 specifies CCITT  
 
G.721 ADPCM for the operation of the ADPCM encoder. Transmit 
and receive signals are sent and received to and from the base 
station in packets in a ping-pong fashion. CAI specifies that a 
part of the packet includes signalling information including such 
things as call setup and termination requests and handshaking 
information. For signal reception, a packet is received, 
demodulated, processed through a G.721 ADPCM decoder, 
converted from digital PCM to analog, and then provided to a 
speaker. Both analog and digital functions are necessary in the 
operation of a digital cordless telephone handset. To perform the 
conversion from analog to PCM and from PCM to analog, a 
conventional integrated circuit such as the Motorola MC145554 
m-law PCM Codec-Filter
