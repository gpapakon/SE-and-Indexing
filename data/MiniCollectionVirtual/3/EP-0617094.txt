<ABSTRACT>
Abhesive coating composition based on a radiation-curing organopolysiloxane which contains (meth)acrylic ester groups, siloxane containing an additive which influences the degree of abhesiveness and is obtainable by reacting an MQ resin with a polysiloxane which contains (meth)acrylic ester groups.

<CLAIMS>
Abhesive coating composition comprising one or
more radiation-curing organopolysiloxanes having

(meth)acrylic ester groups, a controlled release
additive and, if desired, a photoinitiator and

customary fillers, characterized in that the additive
is a polysiloxane obtainable by reacting a siloxane

resin A of the general formula


where

R
1
 is an alkyl radical of 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
R
2
 is an alkyl radical of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an
alkenyl radical of 2 to 6 carbon atoms,
R
3
 is as defined for the radical R
1
 or is an alkoxy
radical of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a hydroxyl radical,

the average molecular weight of the siloxane resin A is
from 500 to 100,000, and x, y and z are numbers, where

the quotient x/(y+z) is from 0.5/1.0 to 1.5/1.0 and
the quotient z/x is from 0/1.0 to 0.4/1.0,

with an organopolysiloxane B of the general formula 


where

R
4
 is an alkyl radical of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl
radical or a hydrogen radical and
R
5
 is as defined for the radical R
4
 or is the radical


in which
R
6
 is a divalent, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon
radical which has up to 20 carbon atoms and may be

interrupted by an oxygen atom, and
R
7
 is a methyl radical or hydrogen radical,

with the proviso that at least one radical R
4
 is a
radical


a is from 0 to 100 and
b is from 0 to 50,

in a weight ratio of siloxane resin A to polysiloxane B
of 100:0.1 to 50 in the presence of an acidic

equilibration catalyst in a temperature range from 0 to
140°C in the presence or absence of an inert organic

solvent.

1
 is a methyl
radical.

2
 is a methyl
radical.

3, characterized in that the radical R
3
 is a methyl
radical.
Coating composition according to one or more of
the preceding claims, characterized in that if R
3
 is a
hydroxyl radical the content of SiOH groups relative to

siloxane resin is ≤ 4% by weight, preferably ≤ 2% by
weight.

the preceding claims, characterized in that the radical

R
4
 is a methyl radical.

the preceding claims, characterized in that the acidic

equilibration catalyst employed is sulphuric acid or
trifluoromethanesulphonic acid in amounts of from 0.05

to 10% by weight, based on the reaction mixture.
