Lightguide device aimed at increasing the light intensity at the output of optical 
fibres (lightguides) and characterized by the fact that a lightguide endpiece (1) 

terminates itself with the smallest bending radius possible immediately after the 
bending,
 
where the refractive index of at least the light guiding core section of the bent 

guide (1) is homogeneous and free of materials tensions and where this device is 
either integral part of the main lightguide or as separate bent part attached to the 

preceding guide. 
Device according to claim 1 whereby the bending angle of the bent lightguide 
piece (1) is more than 45 to 60° and preferably exactly 90°. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2 whereby the numerical aperture of the bent 
lightguide piece (1) is identical or larger than the one of the preceding lightguide.  

 
Device according to claims 1 to 3 whereby the bent lightguide (1) piece is 
foreseen as made from a thermoplastic material bent under the influence of heat. 
Device according to claims 1 to 4 whereby the constitutive material of the bent 
lightguide piece (1) is already prefabricated in bent shape and particularly 

moulded. 
Device according to claim 4 or 5 whereby the bent lightguide piece (1) is 
annealed. 
Device according to claims 1 to 6 whereby the bent lightguide piece (1) is a glass 
or silica (quartz) rod, surrounded by air or water or mirror coated. 
Device according to claims 1 to 3 whereby the bent lightguide piece (1) is hollow 
and designed (so as to achieve) metallic or dielectric light reflection. 
Device according to claims 1 to 3 whereby the bent lightguide piece (1) is 
foreseen hollow with a liquid core and a thin closing device at one end.
