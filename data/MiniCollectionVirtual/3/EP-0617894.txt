<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with concentrated
liquid herbicidal compositions comprising glyphosate
herbicide and at least a co-herbicide other than glyphosate,
essentially insoluble in water, more particularly a diphenyl
ether type of herbicide.Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine) is a widely used
non-selective, highly effective herbicide. Glyphosate
herbicide is normally provided as a water soluble salt,
preferably the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate. Liquid
concentrated formulations intended to be diluted in a spray
tank at farmer's level, generally contain in addition to the
glyphosate salt, a surfactant or a surfactant mixture which
increases the biological effect of the glyphosate herbicide.Numerous studies have been made on the effect of
surfactants on the herbicidal action of glyphosate. Wyrill
and Burnside, Weed Science, Vol. 25 (1977), 275-287, for
instance studied the effects of many different surfactants
including examples from different classes of surfactant.
Some classes of surfactant were more effective than others in
enhancing the herbicidal effect of glyphosate (used as a
solution of the isopropylamine salt). Wyrill and Burnside
concluded that an effective surfactant is an important
component of any glyphosate spray formulation. The authors
also mention that "effectiveness of surfactant combinations
is quite variable and difficult to predict - therefore, the
indiscriminate addition of surfactants or wetting agents to
glyphosate sprays which already contain a surfactant should
be avoided". Glyphosate herbicide is known to act rapidly and
effectively but to show visual symptoms at a relatively late
stage. It has already been suggested in the art to apply
glyphosate herbicide in combination with diphenyl ether type
of herbicides essentially in order to accelerate the
appearance of visual symptoms.WO-A-84/03607 equivalent to EP-A-0 138 945 discloses a
herbicidal composition comprising a glyphosate type herbicide
and an acifluorfen type herbicide. Page 3 contains a broad
statement that small amounts of acifluorfen, or its salts,
added to glyphosate substantially enhance the speed of
phytotoxicity. On pages 11-12, concentrate formulations are
described in a very general manner.Similarly, EP-A-0 143 547 discloses a herbicidal
composition containing glyphosate herbicide and an
oxyfluorfen type herbicide.EP-A-0 340 583 is related to herbicidal compositions
comprising a glyphosate type herbicide (N-(phosphonomethylglycil)sulfonylamine)
and a herbicide
selected within a group containing
