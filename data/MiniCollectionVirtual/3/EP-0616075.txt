Doctor system, preferably for spreading devices, comprising a 
clamping device (8, 8') which supports via a holding blade (7, 7') a 

doctor bed (1, 1') which carries a doctor bar (2), and a pressure 
hose which presses the doctor bed and thus the doctor bar 

against a counter-roller (W), and a clamping ledge (4, 4') provided 
at the rear of the doctor bed (1, 1') which serves to hold the doctor 

bed on the holding blade (4, 4'), 
characterised in that
 the 
clamping ledge (4, 4') is fitted offset from a centre area of the rear 

of the doctor bed so that an engagement surface remains as a 
pressure surface for the pressure hose (3) at this side which is 

positioned essentially in a plane extending through the holding 
blade (7, 7'), and that the clamping ledge (4, 4') is designed as a 

continuation of the doctor bed (1, 1'). 
Doctor system according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 an 
end surface (14) of the doctor bed (1') is provided which extends 

transversely away from the doctor bar (2) and in the direction 
away from the clamping device of the holding blade (8, 8'), which 

is arranged at an angle between 45째 and 55째 to the connecting 
plane between the centre axis of the doctor bar (2) and the press-on 

line of the pressure hose (3), and that the clamping ledge (4') is 
located in this area of the doctor bed (1') remote from the 

clamping device of the holding blade (8'). 
Doctor system according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
clamping ledge (4) is closer to the clamping device of the holding 

blade (8) than to the bed (2) and protrudes beyond the doctor bed 
(2) in the direction of the clamping device. 
Doctor system according to one of Claims 1 - 3, 
characterised in 
that
 it is arranged at an angular range between 20째 and 60째 as 
measured from the base point of the roller (W), in its lower 

quadrant.
