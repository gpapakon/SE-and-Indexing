<ABSTRACT>
Controlled release pharmaceutical tablet having a lenticular form 
consisting of three layers of which the central one or core (a) 

contains the active principle and the two outer layers or barriers (b) 
and (c) comprise gellable and/or erodible polymeric material, said 

barrier layers being equal or different among themselves for 
composition and/or thickness, while the central layer has a limited 

external annular surface exposed to the dissolution medium, through 
which the active principle is released.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a controlled release tablet, having a
lenticular form, consisting of three concentric overposed layers, of
which the central one or core (a) contains the active principle and the
remaining two outer layers (b) and (c) equal or different among
themselves for composition and thickness contain erodible
polymeric materials. The new pharmaceutical form has only a
limited part of the lateral surface of the core containing the active
principle in direct contact with the dissolution medium.In the recent years the controlled release pharmaceutical forms and in
general the so called therapeutic systems able to release an active
substance vehiculated into them for a prolonged period of time and if
possible preprogrammable by suitable tests in vitro, have assumed more
and more importance.To reach the controlled release objective, all the systems used in the
different application fields need the vehiculation of an high quantity
of active substance which, when the system works correctly is gradually
released from the system carrying on its activity for a prolonged
period of time.Controlled release compositions are used in agriculture (for
insecticides, insect-repellents, slug-killers, fertilizers), in the
cosmetic industry (environment and person deodorants, moisturizings) as
well as in the pharmaceutical industry.However, in the pharmaceutical field the need to have "systems" able to 
release the active substance, for a prolonged period of time, at a
suitable velocity for determining and maintaining high and effective
plasmatic levels, is more marked.As signed above, for all the applications fields, but particularly for
the pharmaceutical one, the controlled release systems of the active
substance need the vehiculation of active substance quantities as
higher as longer is the expected period of effectiveness, in other
words as longer the active principle release must result to assure
effective therapeutic levels.The embodiments carryed out and commercialized until today, for
obtaining a prolonged therapeutic covering, or the maintenance of
therapeutically effective plasmatic levels of the substance, are
numerous.Examples of such embodiments are the so called "reservoir" systems, the
osmotic pumps ("OROS"), the "PUSH-PULL" systems.However such systems nearby the undoubted advantages show some
inconvenients of structural and functional kind which limit their
massive use and in general for long periods of time.One of the disadvantages associated to such systems is attributable to
an

<CLAIMS>
A controlled release pharmaceutical tablet having lenticular form consisting of three superposed and
concentric layers of which the central one is the core (a) containing the active principle and the

outer ones are the barriers (b) and (c), said barriers layers being equal or different from each
other for composition and/or thickness and being applied in such way to leave at direct contact

with the dissolution medium the lateral anular surface of the core (a) and 
characterized in that
:

the barrier layers (b) and (c) comprise erodible polymers of the class of hydroxy
propylmethylcellulose, having molecular weight between 1000 and 4.000.000 said erodible polymers being in amount of 50% to 90% by w. of the

total weight of the barrier layer,
the lateral exposed core (a) surface is comprised between 10% and 35% of the total surface of
the tablet.
The tablet as claimed in claim 1, wherein a further outer polymeric film is applied, coating the
whole tablet and further contributing to modulate the active principle release.
The tablet as claimed in claim 2, wherein said outer polymeric film is gastroresistant and
enterosoluble.
The tablet as claimed in claim 3, wherein the outer polymeric film may be such to allow the
activation of the tablet with the active principle release only in the last part of the intestinal tract

or at the colon level.
