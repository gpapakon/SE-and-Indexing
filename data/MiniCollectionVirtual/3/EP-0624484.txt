<ABSTRACT>
The ball point pen comprises an elongate, hollow barrel 
(10), a tubular element (12) arranged coaxially within 

the upper portion of the barrel (10), a writing point 
(18) and a push-button (22) arranged to control the 

extension/withdrawal of the writing point (18) relative 
to the barrel (10). At least one longitudinal rib (40) 

and an annular projection (42) are formed either on the 
inner surface of the sleeve (24) of the push-button (22) 

or on the outer surface of the tubular element (12) and, 
correspondingly, at least one raised, shaped element (44) 

is formed either on the outer surface of the tubular 
element (12) or on the inner surface of the sleeve (24) 

so as to interfere radially with the annular projection 
(42) and to define at least one longitudinal groove (46) 

adapted to form a seat for the rib (40) when the sleeve 
(24) is fitted onto the tubular element (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ball point pen of the 
type including: 
an elongate hollow barrel,  a tubular element located coaxially within the upper 
portion of the barrel,  a writing point fixed to an ink-container tube, this 
tube being located coaxially within the lower portion of 
the barrel and the tubular element and this point being 
arranged at the lower end of the barrel, and  a push-button formed by a sleeve having an end 
surface at one end and an open end at the other, this 
push-button being assembled coaxially at the upper end of 
the pen and arranged to control the extension/withdrawal 
of the writing point relative to the barrel. An example of such type of ball point pen is to be seen in the 
patent publication US-A-4,991,988. The object of the present invention is to provide a pen 
of the type described above in which the push-button may 
be assembled with the other components in an automated 
assembly process. This object is achieved by means of a pen of the type 
described above, characterised in that either the inner 
surface of the sleeve or the outer surface of the tubular 
element has at least one longitudinal rib and an annular 
projection and in that, correspondingly, the outer 
surface of the tubular element or the inner surface of  
 
the sleeve has at least one raised, shaped element which 
interferes radially with the annular projection and 
defines at least one longitudinal groove arranged to form 
a seat for the rib when the sleeve is fitted onto the 
tubular element. During the assembly of the pen of the invention, the 
push-button is positioned along the axis defined by the 
remaining components of the pen, which have already been 
fitted together, and is subsequently fitted onto the 
tubular element with the at least one longitudinal rib 
inserted in the corresponding groove defined by the at 
least one raised, shaped element. This insertion movement also causes the annular 
projection to pass over the at least one raised, shaped 
element as a result of resilient deformation, and to 
position itself beyond the lower edge of the projection. 
When the pen is assembled, this lower edge thus forms a 
stop shoulder for the annular projection and prevents the 
push-button from sliding off the tubular element. The annular projection and a plurality of longitudinal 
ribs, equiangularly spaced around the circumference, are 
preferably formed on the inner surface of the push-button 
sleeve of the pen of the invention, while a plurality of 
raised, shaped elements are

A ball point pen comprising: 

an elongate hollow barrel (10), 
a tubular element (12) arranged coaxially within the 
upper portion of the barrel (10), 
a writing point (18) fixed to an ink-container tube 
(16), this tube (16) being located coaxially within the 

lower portion of the barrel (10) and the tubular element 
(12) and this point (18) being arranged at the lower end 

of the barrel (10), and 
a push-button (22) formed by a sleeve (24) having an 
end wall (26) at one end and an open end (28) at the 

other, the push-button (22) being assembled coaxially at the 
upper end of the pen and arranged to control the 

extension/withdrawal of the writing point (18) relative 
to the barrel (10), 
 
the pen being characterised in that at least one 

longitudinal rib (40) and one annular projection (42) are 
formed on the inner surface of the sleeve (24) or on the 

outer surface of the tubular element (12) and in that, 
correspondingly, at least one raised, shaped element (44) 

is formed on the outer surface of the tubular element 
(12) or on the inner surface of the sleeve (24), the 

raised shaped element being arranged to interfere 
radially with the annular projection (42) and to define 

at least one longitudinal groove (46) arranged to form a 
seat for the rib (40) when the sleeve (24) is fitted onto  

 
the tubular element (12). 
A pen according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the inner surface of the sleeve (24) 

has the annular projection (42) and a plurality of 
longitudinal ribs (40) equiangularly spaced around its 

circumference and in that the outer surface of the 
tubular element (12) has a plurality of raised, shaped 

elements (44) equiangularly spaced around its 
circumference so as to define between them the same 

number of grooves (46) as there are ribs (40), each 
shaped element having a pointed tip (48) at its end 

facing the push-button (22) such that the inclined 
surfaces (52) defining the tips (48) constitute lead-in 

surfaces for facilitating the entry of the ribs (40) into 
the corresponding grooves (46). 
A pen according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
each shaped element (44) has at least one portion (50) 

the thickness of which increases towards the end of the 
shaped element (44) opposite that facing the push-button 

(22). 
A pen according to any one of the preceding claims 
2 or 3, characterised in that the annular projection (42) 

is formed on the sleeve (24) adjacent its open end (28). 
A pen according to any one of the preceding Claims,  
 

characterised in that resilient means (32) are interposed 
between the end wall (26) of the sleeve (24) and the 

upper end (34) of the tubular element (12).
