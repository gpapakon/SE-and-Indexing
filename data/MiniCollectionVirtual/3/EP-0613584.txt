 PROTECTIVE -LAYER FORTHE BACK REFLECTOROFAPHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICEField of the InventionThis invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to (1) improved thin film photovoltaic devices incorporating a protective layer which is adapted to substantially maintain the high reflectivity of the underlying reflective layer; and (2) methods of fabricating improved photovoltaic devices which incorporate such a protective layer.Background of the InventionThe improved photovoltaic devices disclosed herein exhibit increased operational efficiency over the prior art due to improved reflectivity of the underlying reflective layer. Also disclosed are methods for the fabrication of the improved photovoltaic devices. The present invention has particular applicability to (1) large area, thin film, amorphous photovoltaic devices wherein the active semiconductor elements thereof are deposited onto a substrate electrode as relatively thin layers which are subsequently covered by a second electrode, and (2) the fabrication of such thin film, large area photovoltaic devices from amorphous semiconductor alloys.Single crystal photovoltaic devices, especially crystalline silicon photovoltaic devices, have been utilized for some time as sources of electrical power because they are inherently non-polluting, silent, and consume no expendable natural resources in their operation. 

 However, the utility of such devices is limited by problems associated with the manufacture thereof. More particularly, single crystal materials (1) are difficult to produce in sizes substantially larger than several inches in diameter, (2) are thicker and heavier than their amorphous counterparts, and (3) are expensive and time consuming to fabricate.Recently, considerable efforts have been made to develop systems for depositing amorphous semiconductor materials, each of which can encompass relatively large areas, and which can be doped to form p-type and n-type materials for the production of p-i-n type photovoltaic devices which are, in operation, substantially equivalent to their crystalline counterparts. It is to be noted that the term ■•amorphous," as used herein, includes all materials or alloys which have long range disorder, although they may have short or intermediate range order or even contain, at times, crystalline inclusions.It is now possible to prepare amorphous silicon alloys by glow discharge deposition or vacuum deposition techniques. The silicon alloy material possesses (1) acceptably reduced concentrations
