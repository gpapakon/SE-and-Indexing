<ABSTRACT>
The invention is intended to create a device and a method for the control of a starting torque transfer arrangement, which represent an improvement in the account taken of the driver's wishes on the one hand and the vehicle's environment on the other. For this purpose the starting sequence is performed in two phases, that is in a first phase in which the input speed is brought to a set speed, and a second phase following on from this in which a differential speed signal formed from the difference between input speed and output speed is made to follow a predetermined set curve until a value of zero is reached. The first phase begins when the starting torque transfer arrangement is not completely closed and the position of the power control element lies below a certain limit. During the first phase the set speed is first of all determined as a function of the position of the power control element, the variation of the position of the power control element with time and a signal describing the driving style of the driver. With the aid of the set speed thus calculated a reference curve of a control signal is then determined for an actuator of the starting torque transfer arrangement, so that the said set speed is also attained with the power control element in the present position. The second phase of the starting sequence begins when the input speed signal has almost attained the set speed or when a predetermined speed of travel is attained. In the second phase a speed differential signal, that is the wheel slip prevailing in the starting torque transfer arrangement, is reduced to zero in accordance with a reference curve. The thermal loading of the clutch is used in order to influence the starting sequence in that the set speed is determined as a function of this loading.
