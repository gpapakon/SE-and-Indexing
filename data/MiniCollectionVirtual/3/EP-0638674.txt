<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and device for monitoring the
soundness and quality of a twisted yarn produced in a double twist
spindle of a twisting frame.The invention is applicable to a double twist spindle for twisting
together a number of yarns to form a twisted ply yarn. Said yarns
can be of any composition or structure and will be known
throughout the description and claims simply as yarns, whether
they be in the form of filaments or filament complexes or natural
or artificial fibres.The term "twist together" is used herein in the wide sense of
combining two or more yarns, the wide sense including the twisting
of ends of previously twisted single yarns. The invention is
particularly useful for monitoring the twisting of two yarns, but
can however be used for monitoring the twisted combination of
three or more yarns, the limit being fixed only by practical
considerations. It is well known that in a double twist spindle,
the yarns to be twisted together are unwound upwards from at least
two packages rotating about a fixed mandrel.This well known unwinding operation has the drawback of causing 
the yarns to mutually interfere, they becoming interlaced before
entering the central hole in the spindle to form loops, rings,
corkscrew-like spiral parts and other shapes generally of this
nature. It is also well known that yarns unwinding in a double
twisting frame, especially at high speed, are exposed to a
variation in tension, this latter sometimes becoming excessive.In the case of more than one yarn, whether yarns spun from staple
or yarns formed from synthetic filaments, this excessive tension
is undesirable because the yarns undergo severe stressing and
rubbing contact on account of their mutual interference during
their continuous unwinding from the feed packages, and
consequently become excessively stretched, damaged or in the limit
broken. In this respect, a single yarn often breaks, resulting in
a yarn being collected which is no longer twisted with other
yarns, hence leading to the formation of a defective bobbin. Such
a defective bobbin compromises the subsequent working stages in
the production process, and hence reduces the economy and
productivity of plants of this kind. Again, the effect of mutual
intersection and interweaving of the yarns and the effect of the
said frequent sliding contact result in the formation of flying
fibrils and sometimes loose yarn pieces which are often twisted
together with the yarn, causing twisting defects.Double twist spindles of this type have the further

A method of monitoring the quality of a twisted yarn
moving in a path from a double twisting spindle, said twisted

yarn having a plurality of yarn plies, said method comprising
detecting the presence of the twisted yarn as it undergoes

circular movement transverse to its path by an opto-electrical
transducer, constituted by the emitter (21) and

the receiver (36) emitting light and generating a signal
corresponding thereto, said transducer being associated with

the yarn guide eyelet (6), the so
generated signal being amplitude modulated by the presence of

the twisted yarn, characterised by:

a) working of the signal in which it is filtered
to separate the useful signals from the optical interference of the

surrounding environment, amplified demodulated for extracting that
signal part being modulated by the presence of the twisted yarn, and

filtered for removing any residue in the output signal from the demodulation
b) splitting the signal worked in the preceding step
into a first signal and a second signal;
c) converting by the pulse generator (27) said first
signal into binary logic pulses for measuring the passage

frequency of the twisted yarn (5) indicating the real
revolutions of the twisting spindle so measuring the amount

of yarn twist per unit of time;
d) converting said second signal in digital form for
subsequent digital processing by determining the area

subtended by the yarn presence signal;
e) transmitting said converted first signal and second
signal to a processing means (30) for determining whether the

twisted yarn is within a predetermined quality range,;
f) generating by said processing means (30) a signal
causing the cutting of the yarn, if the twisted yarn falls

outside said predetermined range, so preventing any
depositing of unsuitable twisted yarn on the bobbin (18); 
g) returning to the pulse modulator (23), fed by the
pulse generator (24), the analogic signal from the filter

(29) and the digital signal from the pulse generator (27),
passing them through the amplifying (22) and closing the

monitoring loop between the emitter and receiver of the opto-electrical
transducer.
