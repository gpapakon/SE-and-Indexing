<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the preparation of carboxylic acids or of the corresponding esters by reaction of an alcohol with carbon monoxide in the presence of a catalyst containing iridium and of a halogenated promoter. The reaction is carried out with a reaction mixture whose composition is maintained throughout the operation. The said mixture comprises between 0 exclusive and 10% of water, between 0 exclusive and 10% of halogenated promoter, and between 2 and 40% of ester corresponding to the reaction of the abovementioned carboxylic acid and alcohol, the said carboxylic acid constituting the solvent of the reaction.

<CLAIMS>
A continuous process for the preparation of carboxylic acids or
corresponding esters having (n+1) carbon atoms, by the reaction in liquid phase of

carbon monoxide with at least one alcohol having n carbon atoms, in the presence
of an iridium compound-based catalytic system and a halogenated promoter,

characterised in that the water is maintained in the medium during the reaction at a
content ranging between 0 (excluded) and 10%, the ester corresponding to the

above-mentioned carboxylic acid and alcohol at a content ranging between 2 and
40%, and the alcohol between 0 and 10%, preferably between 0.1 and 8%, said

carboxylic acid constituting the reaction solvent.
The process according to the preceding claim, characterised in that a
water content is maintained between 2 and 8% in the mixture.
The process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that a halogenated promoter content is maintained between 1 and 6% in the

mixture.
The process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that a content of the above-mentioned ester is maintained between 5 and 30% in

the mixture.
The process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that a saturated C
1
-C
10
 hydrocarbon alcohol is used.
The process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that a halogenated promoter is used which comprises a halogen selected from

chlorine, bromine or iodine, in combination with hydrogen, a C
1
-C
10
 alkyl radical,
a C
1
-C
10
 acyl radical, or a C
6
-C
10
 aryl radical. 
The process according to the preceding claim, characterised in that a
halogenated promoter is used whose radical corresponds to that of the above-mentioned

alcohol.
The process according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that acetic acid is prepared by a reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide in the

presence of water, methyl iodide, methyl acetate, acetic acid constituting the
reaction solvent.
