<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) for indicating a predetermined tension of a driving belt (31) comprises a base (8), a hub (9) on the base for the drive belt, two links (10) pivotally connected to the base and having outer abutments (11) for the drive belt, and a helical tension spring (12) which is attached to the links (10) and which exert a reactional force corresponding to the predetermined tensional force. The links (10) are arranged for synchronized pivotal movement between two stable end positions for snap-over movement past the centre axis of the hub (9). When the links assume one (C) of their end positions, the drive belt (31) may be moved into abutment against the abutments (11) and the hub (9) and may be tightened while the links (10) are pivoted in synchrony against the action of the helical tension spring (12) until the drive belt extends along a straight line between the abutments. The predetermined tensional force and the reactional force now correspond to one another and thus effect the snap-over movement of the links to the opposite end position of the latter. The very snap-over is the indication of obtainment of the predetermined tension of the drive belt (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns a device for 
indication of a predetermined tension of elongate flexible 
elements, primarily of belts incorporated in belt transmissions, 
e. g. driving belts used in combustions engines 
and running around belt pulleys to drive the generator, 
the radiator fan, the servo pump, air conditioning unit, 
etcetera. During the assembly of new as well as reconditioned 
combustion engines, it is customary to simultaneously 
install the driving belt or belts driving the equipment 
items mentioned above. In a manner similar to that used 
when worn-out belts are replaced by new ones, these belts 
are placed loosely around the various pulleys with the 
adjustment device of e.g. the generator in a non-tightened 
condition. The set screws of the adjustment device is then 
tightened by means of a suitable tool, such as a screwdriver, 
while at the same time the belt is tightened by 
means of another suitable tool, e.g. a lever acting on the 
generator so as to force the latter outwards. The 
magnitude of the belt tension is usually checked by the 
operator who, for instance with the aid of his thumb, 
depresses the belt at a point intermediate two adjacent 
pulleys, and the tightening force or belt tension is 
normally considered to be "correct" if the force exerted 
on the belt in this manner amounts to a depression 
corresponding approximately to 10 mm. However, this method does not make it possible to 
ascertain with sufficient certainty the actual value of 
the belt tension, in addition to which the tension may 
vary within very wide limits from one engine to the next. 
Some belts therefore wear out prematurely as a result of 
slippage.  
 Since in modern engines, particularly motor vehicle 
engines, the driving belts are dimensioned for a comparatively 
long serviceable life, which is a feature 
requested by the consumer, it is necessary to make 
arrangements ensuring that a value of the tensional force 
may be achieved in a reproduceable manner and at a 
carefully predetermined level with only very minute 
tolerance deviations. The purpose of the subject invention is to provide a 
device meeting the demands outlined above in a simple, 
rapid and reliable manner. This purpose is achieved in that the device comprises 
a base, a hub associated with the base and protruding 
therefrom and including a means for supporting the 
elongate element, two links pivotally connected to the 
base at their first, inner end and projecting in opposite 
directions from the base essentially at right

<CLAIMS>
A device for indicating a predetermined tension 
of elongate flexible elements (2), comprising 

a base (8), a hub (9) associated with 
the base and protruding therefrom and including a means 

(23) for supporting the elongate element (2), two links 
(10) pivotally connected to the base (8) at their first, 

inner end (27) and projecting in opposite directions from 
said base (8) essentially at right angles to the hub (9), 

each link (10) formed at its opposite, outer end (30) with 
an abutment (11), said abutments (11) being equidistantly 

spaced from the hub (9) to support the elongate element 
(2), and a resiliently yielding member (12) connected to 

the links (10) and possessing a reactional force corresponding 
to the predetermined tension of the elongate 

element, said links (10) being arranged for synchronized 
pivotal movement between two stable end positions (C, D) 

while passing an imaginary line (E) interconnecting the 
abutment means (11) past the hub (9) for snap-over 

movement, the elongate element (2) arranged, when the 
links (10) assume one (C) of their end positions, to be 

moved to a position of abutment against the link abutments 
(11) and the support (23) of the hub (9) and to be 

tightened upon the synchronized pivotal movement of the 
links against the action of the resiliently yieldable 

member (12), until said elongate element extends along an 
essentially straight line between the abutments, at which 

time the predetermined tension of the elongate element and 
the reactional force of the resiliently yieldable member 

become equal and, in response to the resiliently yieldable 
member, said links snap over to their opposite end 

position (D), said snap-over movement per se being an 
indication of obtainment of the predetermined tension of 

said elongate element. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the base (8) comprises both a 

support plate (13) formed with a recess (14) which is open  
 

outwards and at its ends for reception therein of the 
inner ends (27) of the links (10), and a covering plate 

(16) covering the recess in the support plate outwardly, 
and in that the support plate, the covering plate, and the 

links, in the area of their inner ends, are formed with 
aligned holes (28) for reception therein of pivot pins 

(29) by means of which the links are pivotally connected 
to the base. 
A device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that abutments (39) are provided in the 
recess (14) in the support plate (13) in order to limit 

the angle of pivotal movement of the links (10), said 
abutments thus determining the two stable end positions 

(C,D) of the links. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that adjacent their 
inner ends (27) and at a point further inwards than the 

pivot pins (29), the links (10) are interconnected by 
means of a synchronizing mechanism (42) ensuring the 

synchronized pivotal movability of the links. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that said synchronizing mechanism (42) 

comprises a pin (43) extending through aligned holes (44) 
formed in the links (10), one of said holes
 being 
essentially circular whereas the other one is essentially 

oblong, whereby the pin is allowed some lateral movement 
in compensation for the mutual lateral movement of the 

holes occurring during the pivotal movement of the links 
about the pivot pins (29) between the two stable end 

positions (C, D). 
A device as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized
 
in that in the area of the synchronizing 

mechanism (42) the links (10) are formed with facing 
recesses (45), whereby the innermost portions of the inner

that the links are formed with inner edge faces (46) in  
 

abutment against counter edge faces (47) formed in said 
links in the merger area between the latter and the 

recesses (45) so that the edge faces and the counter edge 
faces form cooperating cam faces which upon the synchronized 

pivotal movement of the links against the action of 
the resiliently yieldable member (12) determine the link 

snap-over point.

claims, 
characterized
 in that the hub (9) is 
connected to the base (8) by means of an attachment plate 

(17), said attachment plate together with the support

the pins positioned on the link face opposite that on 

which the abutments are positioned, forming attachments 
(34) for securing the resiliently yieldable member (12).  

 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
