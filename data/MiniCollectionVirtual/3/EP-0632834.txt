<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides nucleic acids encoding one or more hyper-invasive genes within the hil locus (hyper-invasion locus) or fragments thereof, methods for making attenuated microorganisms and identifying such hyper-invasive nucleic acids as well as mutant microorganisms wherein one or more hyper-invasive genes within the hil locus are modified to attenuate the invasive phenotype of the microorganism. The methods of the invention utilize conditions which repress invasiveness in an otherwise invasive microorganism. The method comprises mutating an invasive microorganism to form a plurality of mutant microorganisms. The thus formed mutants are exposed to conditions which repress invasiveness of the parental invasive microorganism. At least one mutant microorganism is then detected which exhibits an increase in invasiveness as compared to the parental invasive microorganism. The site of mutation in the genome of the mutant microorganism is then determined to localize and identify one or more hyper-invasive genes within the hil locus of the invasive microorganism.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MICROORGANISMS HAVING ATTENUATED INVASIVENESSTechnical FieldThe invention relates to microorganisms having attenuated invasiveness.BackgroundFor many species of microorganisms, invasion and survival within mammalian cells is ■ central to establishing a successful host-parasite relationship. The invasive character of pathogens, while deleterious to the health and viability of host cells, does provide a mechanism for transfer of molecules and aggregates across an intact cellular membrane. Thus, microorganisms having an attenuated invasive phenotype which minimizes the deleterious effect of infection through invasion are useful as a vaccine for the pathogen itself or as a vehicle for transporting molecules of interest into a host organism or its cells.For example, a microorganism having attenuated invasiveness can provide for the transfer of genetic material into a mammalian host or its cells. In this manner, novel genetic capabilities can be imparted to the host. One capability of interest is the synthesis of surface membrane proteins or envelope proteins of pathogens. These proteins can then serve as antigens to provide a strong immune response, without the host 

having to suffer the effects of infection by the pathogen.A number of microorganisms are known to invade mammalian cells including Yersinia,, Shigella and Salmonella . The invasion of epithelial cells by Yersinia pseudotuberculoεis is reported by Bovallius and Nilson, (1975) Can. J. Microbiol.21:1997-2007 and Bolin et al. , (1982) Infect. Immun. 32:506-512. Isberg and Falkow, (1985) Nature 317:262-264 and Isberg et al. , (1987) Cell .50:769-778 describe the invasion locus of Yersinia pseudotuberculosiε . Falkow et al. , Reviews ofInfectious Diseases, 9 Supp. 5 S450-S455 (1987) describes the Yersinia gene inv. Miller and Falkow,(1988) Inf. and I m. _5£:1242-1248 describe a second invasion gene named ail (for attachment invasion locus) . Miller et al.,(1989) Science .242:916-922 describe factors involved with virulence of bacterial pathogens. The nucleotide sequence of the Y. enterocolitica ail gene is described in Miller et al., (1990) Bacterioloσy 172:1062-1069. See also Miller et al. , (1989) Infect, and Immun. 57:121-131.The factors associated with Shigellae invasiveness are described by Hale et al. , (1983) Infect. Immun. 40:340- 350. Sansonetti et al., (1983) ibid 39_:1392-1402 and Maurelli et al., (1985) ibid 49:164-171 describe the manipulation of the plasmid in Shigellae encoding functions essential for invasiveness.Salmonella penetrate
