<ABSTRACT>
Bleach for bleaching hair that has been colored consists of 2 compositions, (A) and (B), which are kept separate before use. (A) contains a reducing agent in aqueous alkaline medium with pH 7.5-12.5, whilst (B) is an acid aqueous emulsion with pH 1-4, containing fat(s) or oil(s), water-soluble emulsifier(s) and perfume(s). Mixing (A) and (B) in equal proportions gives a product with pH 2.5-5.0, ready for use. An Independent claim is also included for the method of bleaching hair that has been colored with this bleach.

<CLAIMS>
Composition for decoloring dyed hair, consisting of two Compositions A and B
being kept separately until application, whereby the Composition A contains at

least one reducing agent in an aqueous carrier and has an alkaline pH-value
between 7.5 and 12.5, and the Composition B is present as an aqueous emulsion,

containing at least one fatty or oily substance, at least one water-soluble
emulsifier, and at least one perfume component, whereby a ready-to-use product

with a pH-value between 2.5 and 5 is obtained upon admixing equal parts of both
Compositions.
Composition according to claim 1, wherein the Composition A contains about 5 %
to about 50 % by weight, calculated to its total composition, of hydroxymethane

sulfinic acid and/or an alkali salt thereof.
Composition according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the Composition A contains about
0.25 % to 2.5 % by weight, calculated to its total composition, of a thickening

agent.
Composition according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, wherein the Composition B
contains about 0.5 % to 10 % by weight, calculated to its total composition, of at

least one C
10
-C
24
-fatty alcohol.
Composition according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, wherein the Composition B
contains about 0.25 % to 7.5 % by weight, calculated to its total composition, of at

least one anionic surfactant of the sulfate, sulfonate, carboxylate and/or alkyl
phosphate type.
Composition according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, wherein the Composition B
contains about 0.1 % to about 1 % by weight, calculated to its total composition, of

a perfume.
Composition according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, wherein the ready-to-use
mixture of the Compositions A and B has a viscosity from about 100 to about

7.500 mPa.s, measured at 20Â°C in a Brookfield rotation viscosimeter. 
Process for decoloring dyed hair, wherein a composition having a pH-value of 2.5
to 5.0, and being obtained by admixing two Compositions A and B, stored

separately prior to application, is applied to wet hair, whereby the Composition A
contains at least one reducing agent in an aqueous carrier and has an alkaline

pH-value between 7.5 and 12.5, and the Composition B is present as an aqueous
emulsion, containing at least one fatty or oily substance and at least one perfume

component and having an acidic pH-value of 1 to 4, the mixture then being left to
process for about five to thirty minutes, subsequently being rinsed out of the hair,

the hair optionally being shampooed and dried.
Process according to claim 8, wherein the hair is treated with a 1 % to 6 %
aqueous hydrogen peroxide composition subsequent to the decoloration.
