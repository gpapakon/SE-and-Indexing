<ABSTRACT>
Aluminized optical fiber is used for transmitting electricity, as well as 
transmitting lightwaves. In one example, an aluminized optical fiber (17) is bonded 

within a photonics package in contact with a conductor (15) that interconnects it to a 
photonic device (12) or other electronic circuitry. Power is then supplied to the 

package by applying it to the aluminized coating (19) of the optical fiber. This 
avoids the need for a separate conductor extending into the photonics package for 

supplying electrical power. It also may significantly simplify system design since 
the power supply can conveniently be included a fairly remote distance from the 

photonics package. 
The aluminized optical fiber can be bonded to a metallization in the V-groove 
(13) that provides electrical contact simply by applying heat and pressure. 

This allows the aluminized fiber to be bonded without the need for any adhesives, 
while assuring good electrical contact for the transmission of electrical power. 

According to another embodiment (FIG. 6), the aluminized coating is used for 
electrical communication in an optical fiber television system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to techniques for transmitting electricity to 
electronic circuitry and, more particularly, to techniques for supplying electricity to 
electronic circuits that are used in conjunction with optical fibers. The union of lightwave technology and electronics technology, a science 
sometimes known as "photonics" or "optoelectronics," has been the subject of 
intensive research and development in recent years. Modern communications 
systems typically use complex electronics circuitry to operate on information in the 
form of electricity, lasers for converting the information to lightwaves, optical fibers 
for transmitting the lightwaves, photodetectors for converting the lightwave signals 
back to electronic signals, and other circuitry for operating on the electrical output of 
the photodetector. Photonics device packages typically enclose one end of an optical fiber 
and a photonics device, e.g., a laser or a photodetector, to seal and protect the 
photonics device and the end of the optical fiber into which light is directed or from 
which light is extracted. As described in the United States patent of H. R. Clark, 
No. 5,017,263, granted May 21, 1991, and the United States patent of Ackerman et 
al., No. 5,124,281, granted June 23, 1992, both hereby incorporated herein by 
reference, an optical fiber can be mounted in precise alignment with the photonics 
device by supporting it in a V-groove photolithographically formed in a 
monocrystalline substrate. Whether the photonics package is a laser package or a 
photodetector package, the photonics device itself must be electrically powered, and 
electronic circuitry associated with the device similarly requires electrical power, 
which is typically supplied by a power source and appropriate electrical conductors 
extending into the photonics package. It has recently been found that aluminized optical fibers, that is, fibers 
covered on their outer surfaces by a thin layer of aluminum, are advantageous for use 
in photonics device packages because the aluminum coating protects the fiber from 
accidental breakage. Aluminized optical fiber can be held within a V-groove by 
epoxy, but it is recognized that the use of such adhesives may constitute a source of 
contamination within the photonics package. Because photonics packages are used 
in such large numbers, there is a long-felt need for techniques that would simplify  
 
their fabrication and operation; it would also be desirable to avoid the use of 
adhesives in such packages. We have
