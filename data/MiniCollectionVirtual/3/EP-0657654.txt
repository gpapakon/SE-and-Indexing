<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pump powered by an integral canned motor 
includes a housing (4) having a cylindrical passage (6) 

extending therethrough. A sealed annular stator (10) is 
mounted around the housing. An impeller assembly (16) 

is rotatably mounted in the passage in the housing. The 
impeller assembly includes an axial flow impeller (18) 

and a sealed rotor (20) mounted around the periphery of 
the impeller. Bearings, including thrust bearings (24), 

are mounted between the periphery of the impeller 
assembly and the housing. A radial flow auxiliary 

impeller (28) may be mounted on the impeller assembly to 
create a radial flow of water from the cylindrical 

passage in the housing to a peripheral fluid circulation 
channel (26) between the impeller assembly and the 

housing. The auxiliary flow impeller pressurizes the 
peripheral fluid circulation channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid pumps. Many chemical processes utilize fluid pumps to 
circulate fluids, such as water and industrial 
chemicals, in reactors, distribution columns, kettles, 
water treatment plants and the like. Pumps in that type 
of service typically produce comparatively high flow 
rates at low heads and operate at relatively high 
specific speeds. One conventional device for providing circulation of 
fluids in such installations is a shaft sealed 
circulator, or elbow pump, of the type shown in Figure 
1. An axial flow impeller I is positioned inside the 
pipe P through which the fluid is being circulated 
adjacent to an elbow in the pipe. Impeller I is 
connected to a cantilevered shaft S. Shaft S extends 
through pipe P and exits through the wall W of the elbow 
portion of the pipe P. Seals X are provided between 
shaft S and wall W of pipe P where the shaft exits the 
pipe. The shaft is rotatably connected to a motor M, 
often through a belt drive BD. A bearing B is provided 
to rotatably support shaft S. Motor M rotates shaft S, 
which rotates impeller I. The rotation of impeller I 
produces a flow in the pumped fluid. There are several disadvantages with that type of 
pump installation. The seals require a considerable 
amount of maintenance and must be replaced often. Some 
chemicals have a detrimental affect on the seals and 
improper alignment of the shaft can cause them to 
deteriorate. If the seals fail, leakage may occur,  
 
which could result in toxic emissions and hazards to 
personnel. In some installations, the seals may have 
tobe isolated from the pumped fluid. In addition, the 
mechanical components of the drive used with prior art 
systems require a considerable amount of maintenance. 
The drive shaft length is limited, thereby requiring the 
motor and drive to be located near the impeller. Because 
the shaft must exit the pipe, suitable locations for the 
pump are limited to those adjacent to pipe elbows. There is a need for a circulation pump that does not 
require a drive shaft for rotation of the impeller and 
the associated seals. There also is a need for a pump 
that can be installed in any desired location in a 
length of pipe. These needs are met by the invention claimed in 
claim 1. This invention will be more clearly understood from 
the following detailed description of the preferred 
embodiment given with reference to the drawings appended 
hereto, wherein: Figure 1 shows a schematic view of a prior art pump 
installation. Figure 2 shows a longitudinal
