<ABSTRACT>
A structure of the sealing part of a discharge lamp, in which an open end of a bulb is sealed with a closing body having a 
core part constituting an electrode. The composition component of the closing body is the one which has substantially the same 

thermal expansion coefficient as that of the bulb in the region on the bulb side adjacent to the open end of the bulb, and also, has 
substantially the same thermal expansion coefficient as that of the core in the region on the core side adjacent to the core part. 

The component in the intermediate region between the bulb and core sides is adjusted so that it has a thermal expansion coefficient 
which gradually changes from that of the bulb side region to that of the core side region. The bulb region side and the core 

region side are separated by the intermediate region to form the independent bulb side region layer and the core side region layer, 
respectively. The intermediate region is structured with at least one layer having a thermal expansion coefficient gradually changing 

from that of the bulb side region to that of the core side region. Preferably, the thickness of the layers of the closing body 
gradually increase from the bulb side region to the core side region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sealing structure
for a light-emitting bulb assembly for use in a metal-vapor
discharge lamp such as a mercury-vapor lamp, a metal
halide lamp, or a sodium-vapor lamp, or a high-intensity discharge
lamp, and a method of manufacturing such a light-emitting
bulb assembly.Metal-vapor discharge lamps include a mercury-vapor
lamp, a metal halide lamp, and a sodium-vapor lamp. The mercury-vapor
lamp emits light excited from the mercury in a
positive column produced in a hot-cathode arc discharge. In
the metal halide lamp, a metal halide is evaporated into a
metal and a halogen by the heat of a mercury hot-cathode arc
discharge to emit light in a color inherent in the metal.
The sodium-vapor lamp emits light in yellowish orange at a D
line (589.0 nm, 589.9 nm) produced by a hot-cathode arc of a
sodium vapor. Heretofore, such metal-vapor discharge lamps
have been used as illuminating lamps for gymnasiums and factories,
light sources for overhead projectors and color liquid
crystal projectors, fog lamps for automobiles, and so on.The bulbs of metal-vapor discharge lamps were initially
made of quartz glass. However, since the quartz glass
has poor fade resistance and a large thermal capacity, the 
metal-vapor discharge lamps cannot be turned on quickly and
the individual bulbs have large dimensional variations.
Therefore, it has recently been proposed to make bulbs of
light-transmissive ceramic.Generally, a light-emitting bulb assembly for a
discharge lamp comprises a bulb made of light-transmissive
ceramic in the form of fired alumina or the like, and a closure
by which an electrode supported by an electrode support
is sealed and fixed in the bulb. To join the closure hermetically
to an open end of the bulb, a glass solder is filled
in a gap between end and inner surfaces of the open end of
the bulb and a confronting surface of the closure, heating
the glass solder to melt same, and then cooling and solidifying
the melted glass solder.It is the general practice for the closure to have
the same coefficient of thermal expansion as and to be as
chemically stable against metal vapor and halogen vapor as
the bulb or the electrode support.When the closure is joined to the bulb by the glass
solder, a starting rare gas and a discharging metal component
depending on the discharge lamp which incorporates the bulb
assembly, e.g., mercury if the discharge lamp is a high-pressure
mercury vapor lamp, or a metal halide if the discharge
lamp is a metal halide lamp, are sealed in the bulb.The
