<ABSTRACT>
An exposure device for sucking photosensitive 
materials of different widths on an exposure table. A 

suction belt, driven by a motor, is formed with a plurality 
of suction holes uniformly. On the back of the suction 

belt is mounted a suction box with a belt support plate 
which is formed with a plurality of suction holes. A pair 

of adjusting plates are attached to the belt support plate 
on its back. By adjusting the position of the adjusting 

plates in a width direction, the suction holes in the 
outermost rows at both sides are opened and closed. Thus, 

the suction width for the suction belt can be adjusted 
according to the width of the photosensitive material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an exposure device of the type as defined in the preamble of claim 1, used to
print/expose a negative image on a negative film on a
photosensitive material.An exposure device of the above mentioned type is known from GB-A-1358337, and is shown in Fig. 5.
In this exposure device, a photosensitive material
P drawn from a roll R is cut to a predetermined size by a
cutter device 30. The photosensitive material P1, which is
now cut off, is supported on an exposure table 20. A
negative film F is illuminated by a light source 21 to
print/expose the negative image thereon on the
photosensitive material P1 through a printing lens 22.As shown in Fig. 6, the exposure table 20 in the
exposure device comprises a motor 23, an endless suction
belt 24 driven by the motor 23 and formed with a plurality
of suction holes 25, a suction box 26 having a support
plate 27 formed with a plurality of suction holes 28, which
are communicable with the suction holes 25 of the suction
belt 24, and a blower 29 for sucking the interior of the
suction box 26. The photosensitive material P1 is sucked
and kept in its position by a suction force applied through
the suction holes 28 and the suction holes 25 until it is
fed to the exposure stage to be printed and exposed.Furthermore, the photosensitive material P1 after 
printed and exposed is fed from the exposure table 20 to a
developing unit (not shown) by the movement of the suction
belt 24.In such a conventional exposure device, the suction
force is applied through all the suction holes 25 of the
suction belt face 24a regardless of the width of the
photosensitive material P1. If it has a small width, so
many suction holes 25 are open that the air is also sucked
into the suction box 26 through the suction holes 25.Thus, the suction force per unit surface area of the
photosensitive material P1 becomes so weak that it is not
sucked enough and gets afloat. This will cause a problem
of fuzziness.If the suction force is set based on the smallest
width of the photosensitive material P1 to solve this
problem, it is necessary to provide a blower 29 of an
extremely large capacity, resulting another problem of
noise. Moreover, the suction belt 24 has a larger transfer
resistance, which will increase the size of the motor 23 as
well as the cost. EP-A-152 548 discloses an apparatus for automatically fixing a
film material onto a suction plate. The apparatus includes
drive rolls for feeding a film material along the cover plate
of a suction box, which is provided with holes
