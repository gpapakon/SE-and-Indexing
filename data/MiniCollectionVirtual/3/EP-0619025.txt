Linear acoustic antenna, including a set of 
hydrophones distributed along the antenna to form directional 

reception paths, characterized in that each 
hydrophone comprises at least one velocity sensor formed 

by at least one flexible bimetallic strip (102) fitted to 
one end of an inertial mass (101) and means (301-303) for 

processing the signals from this sensor so as to obtain 
two directionality diagrams in the form of opposite 

cardioids respectively pointed perpendicularly to the two 
faces of the bimetallic strip, these diagrams making it 

possible to resolve at least one ambiguity in the reception 
paths, this sensor and the means for obtaining a 

single cardioid being known per se, and in that the 
inertial mass is formed by a hollow cylinder (201) closed 

by two plugs (202, 203) into which the bimetallic strips 
(102, 103) are respectively fitted. 
Antenna according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each hydrophone furthermore includes a second 

flexible bimetallic strip (103) fitted to the other end 
of the inertial mass (101), perpendicularly to the plane 

of the first bimetallic strip, and means for processing 
the signals from this second bimetallic strip for forming 

reception signals which are similar to those of the first 
bimetallic strip but offset by 90Â° with respect to these 

signals and to make it possible to resolve two mutually 
perpendicular ambiguities. 
Antenna according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that one of the ambiguity resolutions is of the 

right/left type and the other of the up/down type. 
Antenna according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,  
 

characterized in that the cylinder (201) comprises a 
lateral recess (104) making it possible to accommodate 

the means (301-303) for processing the signals from the 
bimetallic strips. 
Antenna according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the inertial mass is formed by two 

substantially cylindrical end parts (402, 403) into which 
the bimetallic strips are fitted, and in that the 

hydrophone furthermore comprises a pressure hydrophone 
(404) placed between the two end parts, and an overmoulded 

part extending between the two end parts to 
reconstitute with the inertial mass a substantially 

continuous cylinder. 
Antenna according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the means (301-303) for processing the signals from 

the bimetallic strips are embedded in the overmoulded 
part. 
Antenna according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the inertial mass is pierced by 

longitudinal holes making it possible to accommodate 
fastening cables (105) extending all along the antenna. 
Antenna according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the bimetallic strips (502) include 

a narrowed end (501) making it possible to fit the 
bimetallic strip into the inertial mass (202) in such a 

way that this bimetallic strip has, at the point of 
insertion, a rotational movement rather than a bending 

movement.
