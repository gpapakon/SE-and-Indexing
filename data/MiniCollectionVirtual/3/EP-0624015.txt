<ABSTRACT>
An ATM communication system comprising an ATM switch
having a plurality of input ports and a plurality of output ports,

each of the said input ports being fed from an input port server
and each of the said output ports being arranged to feed an output

port server. Each input port server has a plurality of buffer
stores, one for each of the output ports to which said output port

data is transmitted through the switch. Each buffer store in the
input port servers is arranged to interrogate the output port

server with which it communicates by means of a bandwidth
request before the transmission of data, thereby determining

whether output port server data handling capacity is available,
whereby ATM switch operation during periods of peak traffic is

facilitated. The system includes a queuing arrangement for
bandwidth requests received during periods when there is no

available bandwidth capacity, the arrangement being such that
requests are released in a predetermined order when capacity

becomes available.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
communication systems.More especially the invention relates to apparatus operative
to facilitate ATM switch operation during periods of peak data
traffic, and to the problem of efficiently allocating bandwidth
resources in a situation where a multiplexed stream of ATM cells
are to be individually switched to different ports.The above problem has already been addressed and
discussed in our co-pending patent application number
GB9212447.8, to which attention is hereby directed and is further
discussed hereafter.ATM data traffic is predominantly bursty data traffic. By its
nature, bursty traffic requires high bandwidths for a part of the
time and little or no bandwidth for the rest of the time. In order
to efficiently use available bandwidth it is necessary to allocate
the bandwidth using the mean bandwidth requirement of each
data source and not the peak bandwidth. Thus it will be
appreciated that if mean bandwidth allocation is used, the total
peak bandwidth may thus be greater than the bandwidth
available. Thus in operation of an ATM switch, a problem occurs
when a number of data sources burst at the same time causing a
peak overload condition to occur inside an ATM
switch/multiplexer. If not controlled or limited this condition will 
cause data overflow in one or many of the switch/multiplexer
internal data buffers, and this will result in data being lost. This is
described in, for example, the paper by Tamir et al, Computer architecture, May 1988, p. 343-354.Data destined for a particular output port will enter a switch
from many different input ports. The total instantaneous data
rate across a switch may be greater than an output port can
sustain, and therefore buffering is required. However, even with
the provision of buffering, eventual loss of data due to buffer
overflow may occur. To reduce this probability to an
operationally acceptable level by simply increasing peak
capability, results in a low utilisation of the switch for much of the
time, which is clearly unacceptable. A dynamic bandwidth
allocation protocol, as described hereafter, provides a method of
allocating bandwidth by sending requests for bandwidth to a
designated output port and sending data thereafter only when
bandwidth has been allocated as indicated by a return
acknowledgement message.In ATM systems, request messages for increases in
bandwidth are sent by an input port server to an output port
bandwidth allocation mechanism for initial processing. When a
switch is

An ATM communication system comprising an ATM switch
(1, 25) having a plurality of input ports and a plurality of output

ports, each of the input ports being fed from an input port server
(2-4) and each of the output ports being arranged to feed an

output port server (8), said input port servers
each having a plurality of buffer stores (A, B, Z, 22, 23), one for

each of the output ports, to which said output ports data is
transmitted through the switch (1, 25), each buffer store (A, B, Z,

22, 23) in the input port servers being arranged to interrogate the
output port server (8) with which it communicates before the

transmission of data, thereby to determine whether output port
server data handling capacity is available, whereby ATM switch

operating during periods of peak data traffic is facilitated.
A system as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the interrogation
takes the form of a bandwidth request signal from an input port

server (2-4) in respect of an associated buffer store (A, B .....Z,
22, 23), the request signal being directed to an output port server

(8) with which that buffer store communicates via the switch (1),
and an acknowledgement signal from this output port server (8)

in the presence of available capacity, in response to which
acknowledgement signal data is thereafter transmitted from the

buffer store (A, B ..... Z, 22, 23) to the output port (8) via the
switch (1). 
A system as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein ATM
data traffic is transmitted in frames, wherein each frame

comprises a plurality of cells, an end of frame marker being
transmitted in the final cell of each frame, the request signal

being sent in the first cell of each frame, ie. a cell following a cell
which includes an end of frame marker.
A system as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the request cell is
arranged to request a bandwidth allotment which is based on

mean frame size, ie. the mean data capacity of a frame.
A system as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the
request signal is sent in dependence upon the data stored from

time to time in a buffer store.
A system as claimed in Claim 5, wherein each buffer store
(22, 23) embodies a plurality of data thresholds (T1, T2, T3),

request signals being transmitted in accordance with the
threshold reached.
An ATM communication system as claimed in any preceding
claim 
characterised by
 a queuing arrangement (35) for bandwidth
requests received during periods when there is no available

bandwidth capacity, the arrangement being such that requests are
released in a predetermined order when capacity becomes

available. 
A system as claimed in Claim 7, wherein the order of release
is first to arrive, first to be processed.
A system as claimed in Claim 7, wherein a priority releasing
system is provided for queued requests determined in

dependence upon the character of data appertaining to each
queued request.
