<ABSTRACT>
A system for recording and reproducing data including user data on a magnetic tape having a number of partitions in which recording can be performed, the tape having at least one system zone in which user data is not recorded, the system having a table of data located near the beginning of the tape and near each system zone with the table including data identifying the physical location of the system zones and partitions and other sections of the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and more particularly, to
recording and reproducing apparatus and methods for achieving very high density recording of
digital information at very high transfer rates. The market for mass storage devices is growing at what seems to be an ever
increasing rate with the sales of high-performance computers penetrating numerous industries
ranging from financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing power of these
high-performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster than the ability of
storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid retrieval is particularly
pronounced in computational-intensive applications which create huge amounts of data that need to
be accessed in seconds rather than minutes, hours or even days.Magnetic disks remain the preferred media for direct access to frequently used files
because cf their fast access times. However, because of their high cost per-unit of storage (such
as a megabyte) and their limited capacity, magnetic disk recorders are prohibitively expensive and
therefore impractical for large-scale data storage. With the advances in magnetic tape technology,
tape based systems remain the preferred choice for mass data storage. In addition to cost,
magnetic tape exceeds the storage density of any other medium, at least from a volumetric
standpoint, because tape is a much thinner medium than, for example, magnetic disks, and tape
can be tightly packed. A general discussion of such technology may be found in Mass Storage
Technologies, by S. Ranada, published in 1991 by Meckler Publishing.The tape format basically defines the recording path used to record signals on the
tape. There are many different recording formats developed for data recording and reproducing.
A commonly used format for high capacity systems is IBM's 3480 multi-track tape cartridge
format in which the tape transport employs a stationary head and records data along longitudinal
tracks. Since the late 1970's rotary head helical scan recorders, a technology developed originally
for video recorders, have been used for recording data. In helical scan recorders, the tape is
transported past a rapidly rotating head along a helical path whereby data is recorded diagonally
across the tape. Compared to longitudinal recorders, helical scan recorders generate high
recording densities and lower tape speeds for a given data transfer rate.The invention is defined in the claims, which are characterised with
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system adapted to selectively record and reproduce
digital data on a magnetic tape, which has a plurality of

boundaries defined along its length, the boundaries dividing
the tape into a plurality of recording partitions, said

system comprising:

a rotary scanner (32) adapted to selectively record and
reproduce user data on sets of helical-scan tracks in a

recording areas of said tape;
servo means for controlling the longitudinal movement of the
tape;
processing means for providing said user data to said
recording means for recording thereby on said tape, said

processing means generating a table of data for recording by
said recording means on said tape at least at one location,

said table including data identifying the locations of said
boundaries along said tape; and
at least one system zone (158) having a first sub-zone of a
length sufficient to allow the threading of the tape around,

and the unthreading of tape from, the rotary scanner, and a
second sub-zone in which tape format data is recorded,

characterised in that a plurality of system zones are
provided whose location is independent of the location of

the partitions, said system prohibits the recording of user
data within said second sub-zone, and said tape format data

includes a table as aforesaid, the table including data
identifying the location of the beginning of each system

zone and each partition of the tape. 
A system according to claim 1 wherein the
orientation of the system zones relative to the partition is

described by a plurality of sections defined within said
tape, the number of sections being independent of the number

of partitions, said table including data identifying the
location and being of said sections.
A system according to claim 2 wherein said table of data
comprises a plurality of table entries, said table

including data indicating the number of entries in the
table, based on the location of each section relative to the

beginning of the tape.
A system according to claim 3 wherein each table entry
includes data identifying the physical location on the tape

where said section begins, and the partition in which said
section is located.
A system according to claim 4 each table entry that
identifies the physical location on the tape where a section

begins comprises an identification of a set of helical
tracks (DF).
A system according to any foregoing claim wherein the
servo means co-operates with a recorded track extending

longitudinally along the tape and the track is recorded in
the or each system zone.
