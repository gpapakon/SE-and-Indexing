<ABSTRACT>
The bearing which is intended to be interposed between a shaft (A) with a reduced-diameter part (R) in the middle, bordered by two end pieces (E), one of which is capped by a sleeve (M) capable of sliding axially and a support, consists of an inner race (10), of an outer race (20), of a hooping ring (30), of rolling members (40) and of a cage (50), is characterised in that at least one of the sides of the cage is provided with a bearing element (5220, 5221, 5223) and in that the reduced-diameter part is equipped with an abutment element such as a ramp (121) so as normally to hold the cage (50) in place, axially stationary, and allow an axial sliding of the cage (50) after deformation of the bearing element when the sleeve (M) encounters, in particular, the cage (50). Application to land-based motor vehicles.
