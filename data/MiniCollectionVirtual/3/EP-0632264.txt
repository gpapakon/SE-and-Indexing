<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for rapid
analysis of solid sample made of metallic material or ceramic
material, or the like and to a technology to improve the
accuracy of analysis by laser vaporization through an
optimization of the conditions for fine particle generation.Along with the movement toward maintaining and improving
quality, basic material industry dealing with metals and
ceramics has strongly wanted the development of a material
analysis method which is carried out quickly at a high accuracy.Responding to the request, an analysis by laser vaporization
has been studied.The analysis by laser vaporization started from the
conventional analytical technology such as atomic absorption
analysis and plasma emission analysis which determine the
absorption spectra and emission spectra of elements in a
solution by introducing the solution into an excitation flame,
and extended the application to solid specimens. Accordingly, a 
solid target specimen is analyzed promptly by eliminating a
step for liquefying the specimen. A proposed method for that
purpose is the one where the solid specimen is vaporized to
generate fine particles which are then introduced to an
analytical device described above using a carrier gas to
analyze the solid state elements by direct excitation thereof.
The analytical device consists of a gas supply section, a fine
particle generation section, and an element detection section,
being attached to a data processing section and other
auxiliary sections.The solid specimen is sealed in a fine particle generation
box, where the solid specimen is irradiated by laser rays in an
inert gas flow. A part of the solid specimen becomes fine
particles. The laser rays are easy for irradiating the solid
specimen in a pulsed state while focusing on the surface of the
specimen, and are capable of charging large amount of energy
with a high density in a short time. By utilizing the energy,
the laser rays which irradiate the surface of the solid
specimen melt it to emit or vaporize a part of the specimen to
generate extremely fine particle samples. Even from a solid
state specimen, the generated very fine particles are allowed to
exist uniformly distributed in air, which uniformity is very
close to that of a dissolved element in a solution.However, the performed uniformity of the fine particles has
not yet given a sufficient accuracy of analysis compared with
that in a solution specimen. One of the causes of inferior
accuracy is the difficulty of generating a large quantity of 
fine
