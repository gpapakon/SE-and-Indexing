<ABSTRACT>
A package, as a closable container which can be made by machine, in particular from cardboard, for example for books, in which four container surfaces (11 to 14) and a projection/flap (15) are formed by a rectangular material blank (10) provided with appropriate fold lines, while the two remaining container surfaces comprise prefabricated padding tubes (16, 17) which are connected at their undersides to the container bottom (11) prior to the container being filled and to the closable lid (13) at their upper sides after the container has been filled, in each case by an application of glue, the free end of which lid can be overlapped by the projection (15), which can be folded over from the other side, and is tightly sealed with said projection by means of a glued connection.

Packaging consisting of a folding material such as cardboard, paperboard 
or corrugated fiberboard, in the form of a machine-produceable omnidirectionally 

closed parallelepipedic container for books and/or arbitrary 
other products, comprising four container walls - namely bottom (11), cover 

(13) and two sides (12, 14) - as well as a projection which can be bent toward 
each other about parallel fold lines and which are formed by a rectangular 

blank of material (10), the two remaining container walls (16, 17) being 
formed by pre-fabricated fasteners of parallelepipedic shape with the 

side surfaces of said fasteners corresponding to the container height and 
their top and under sides matching the length of a product compartment (18) 

in the container and being glued to the cover (13) or to the bottom (11), respectively,
characterized in that
the fasteners are hollow padding strips (16, 17) with rectangular cross sections 
pre-fabricated from second rectangular blanks of material (29), 
and a first of the two sidewalls (12, 14) of the container adjacent to the 
bottom (11) continues through the cover (13) and the second of said sidewalls 

(12, 14) continues through the projection (15) which, as a projecting 
tab, overlaps at least the free end of the cover (13) to which it is firmely affixed 

by glueing. 
Packaging according to claim 1, characterized in that by changing the 
spacings between the fold lines (e.g. 25, 26, 27, 28) in the first blank of material 

(10), containers of different height and/or width may be made, the 
largest sum of height and width being limited by a specified minimum overlap 

of the projection (15) regarding the cover (13) and the least sum is limited 
by a maximum overlap which corresponds to the width of the cover. 
Packaging according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the fold 
lines of first and second blanks (10, 29) of corrugated fiberboard run transversely 

to the direction of the corrugations. 
Packaging according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the product compartment (18) bounded by hollow padding strips (16, 

17) along its end surfaces is divided by at least one additional hollow padding 
strip (19) which is glued to the bottom (11). 
Packaging according to claim 4, characterized in that at least one of 
the hollow paddings strips forms an upwardly open receptical (37) with a 

rectangular bottom and is of the same height as the packaging container. 
Packaging according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that hollow padding strips (16, 17, 19) of different cross-sections made of 

blanks of material (29) of the same size are formed, in that a projection (35) 
produced by fold lines more closely adjacent is received in the padding cavity 

as a double material or as an additional projection (36). 
Packaging according to claim 6, characterized in that the projection of 
a hollowing padding strip forms an outer double material and a continuation 

of the projection (35) along the bottom level of the padding.  
 
Packaging according to one of the claims 4 to 7, characterized in that 
a partition (38) for dividing the product compartment is prepared in such a 

manner from the second blank that the sidewalls (39) are doubled by means 
of tightly adjoining fold lines and that projections (35) glued to the container 

bottom start from each sidewall (39). 
Method for manufacturing a packaging from a folding material such 
as cardboard, paperboard or corrugated fiberboard into a generally parallel-epipedic 

container for books and/or other arbitrary products, wherein 

a first rectangular blank of material comprises four parallel fold lines mutually 
bounding the bottom, cover, two sides and a projecting tab appended 

to one side, 
second blanks of material folded to subtend rectangular cross-sectional 
cavities and receiving glue to form folded and glue-bearing hollow padding 

strips deposited and bonded on the bottom in the vicinity of the free ends, 
said hollow padding strips forming two side surfaces of the container and 

limiting the length of a product compartment, 
the container sides are erected across the bottom until resting against the 
open ends of the hollow padding strips, 
the product is placed into the product compartment, 
the cover is glued to and closed on the top sides of the hollow padding 
strips and is overlapped at its free end by the tab and is bonded to it. 
Method according to claim 9, characterized in that at least one hollow 
padding strip similar to the hollow padding end strips or a partition pad is 

bonded, i.e. glued, to the bottom.  
 
Method according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the first 
blank is moved parallel to its smaller dimension along a path of advance 

and in that the container sides are erected only following deposition and 
glueing of the paddings. 
Method according to claim 11, characterized in that first a container 
side is erected against the end surface of the paddings and that thereafter the 

product and/or an enclosure item is inserted through the as yet not erected 
container side into the container compartment. 
Method according the one of the claims 9 to 12, characterized in that 
the procedural steps are carried out at consecutive work stations of a conveyor 

line each time while the line is set at rest between timed advances. 
Machine for manufacturing a packaging according to one of the 
claims 1 to 8 and/or to implement the method according to one of the claims 

9 to 13, characterized in that the manufacturing line is a timed longitudinal 
conveyance line passing through a plurality of sequential and equidistant 

work stations, namely at least through 

a feed and scoring station (40, 42) for the fold lines running in the direction 
of advance of the first blank, 
a joining station (46) associated with a gripper system to deposit prefabricated 
hollow padding strips on the bottom of the blank, 
a filling station (66) to fill the blank's laterally open product compartment, 
one or more erecting stations (64, 86) with guide means to raise the container 
sides, 
and two closing stations (88, 92) with glue nozzles to glue the hollow 

padding strips and to close the cover and further with a glue nozzle the 
cover and to close the projecting tab (15). 
Machine according to claim 14, characterized in that 

a pre-fabrication line (58) closed off by the gripper system (60) and in particular 
runing perpendicularly to the conveyance line leads to the joining 

station (46) and comprises a feed, scoring and cutting station (50, 52) to 
score and to cut a blank into mutually parallel second blanks for hollow 

padding strips, 
consecutive folding and glueing stations (56), buffer sections and a glue 
roller station (62) between the buffer sections and the joining station are present 

for each second blank in the pre-fabrication line, 
and the gripper system (60) is designed as a common conveyor means for 
several hollow padding strips across the glue roller station until said strips 

are deposited on the blank in the joining station (46).
