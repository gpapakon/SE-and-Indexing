<ABSTRACT>
Method for detecting data packets, such as ATM data cells. The 
preamble comprises a bit alignment word (AW) and a unique word (UW). 

Successively, the Hamming distances are calculated from the first detected 
1-bit, over a length of AW plus UW, then from the next bit over a length of 

UW, and finally from the second 1-bit, again over a length of AW plug UW. 
The position of the first bit of the detected data packet is then calculated on 

the basis of the hd values thus calculated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for detecting,
from a bit stream, data packets such as ATM data cells, in
particular where these originate from different sources and
are combined into one stream of data packets, each data
packet being preceded by a preamble which comprises at
least a gap, formed by a number of 0-bits, and a unique
word UW, whose reference value is formed by a specific
combination of 0-bits and 1-bits and which has a length of
b(uw) bits.It is generally known to have data packets preceded
by a string of 0-bits ("gap") and a recognition
string, the unique word (UW). using windowing of the
detected bit stream, the beginning of a new data packet is
detected as soon as the bit string within the window
corresponds to the specified UW which is known beforehand
and stored in the system in which the data packets have to
be detected. If this method is to have a sufficiently low
error probability, the UW has to be fairly long, which
results in the detection thereof being relatively
processing-intensive and thus requiring a considerable
amount of time.
It is also possible to use different synchronisation words,
as is disclosed as such -viz. within the area of mobile
radio communication- by GB2172176. GB2172176 discloses a
method of block synchronisation of data in a mobile radio
communication system, said method comprising the steps of:
encoding data to be transmitted and forming the encoded
data into blocks, adding to the head of said blocked data a
block synchronising signal having a plurality of different
successive patterns positioned in a prescribed order, and
transmitting the blocked data together with said block
synchronising signal, followed by the steps of receiving
said transmitted data and recognising one of said patterns 
constituting the block synchronisation signal, and
estimating the data start position on the basis of the
position of the properly recognised pattern within the
block synchronisation signal, and decoding the blocked data
beginning from said estimated position as received data.
Another method for synchronising, however within the area
of ATM, is disclosed by Takahashi Y et al, New retiming and
synchronisation scheme for optical ATM switching systems,
Electronics Letters, vol.26, no.2, pp. 99-100. In this
disclosure a signal format and retiming method for optical
ATM switching systems is proposed. An input signal is
transformed to an optical signal with a unique word as a
guard time for switching. A common optical receiver can be
used for bit synchronisation, and logic

Method for detecting, from a bit stream, data packets such as
ATM data cells, in particular where these originate from different sources and

are combined into one stream of data packets, each data packet being
preceded by a preamble which comprises at least a gap, formed by a number

of 0-bits, and a unique word UW, whose reference value is formed by a
specific combination of 0-bits and 1-bits and which has a length of b(uw) bits,


CHARACTERIZED IN that
 the UW is preceded by a bit alignment word AW
whose reference value is formed by, beginning with a 1-bit, a specific

combination of 0-bits and 1-bits and which has a length of b(aw) bits, the
following steps being carried out successively for the purpose of detecting a

new data packet after a previous data packet has ended:

detect, from the bit stream, the first 1-bit to occur and calculate, for a first
detected bit string B(d1), which begins with that first detected 1-bit and has a

length b(d1) equal to the number of bits b(aw) of the reference AW plus the
number of bits b(uw) of the reference UW, the Hamming distance hd(1)

between that first detected bit string B(d1) and a first reference bit string
B(aw+uw) which is equal to the reference AW plus the reference UW;
calculate, for a second detected bit string B(d2), which begins with the
detected bit, (b(aw)-1) bits after the said detected first 1-bit to occur, and has

a length b(d2) equal to the number of bits b(uw) of the reference UW, the
Hamming distance hd(2) between that detected bit string B(d2) and a second

reference bit string B(uw) which is equal to the reference UW;
detect, from the bit stream, the second 1-bit to occur and calculate, for a
third detected bit string B(d3), which begins with that second detected 1-bit

and has a length b(d3) equal to the number of bits b(aw) of the reference AW
plus the number of bits b(uw) of the reference UW, the Hamming distance 

hd(3) between that third detected bit string B(d3) and the third reference bit
string B(aw+uw) which is equal to the reference AW plus the reference UW;
calculate the position of the first bit of the new data packet on the basis of
one or more of the calculated Hamming distances hd(1), hd(2) and hd(3)

according to the following rules, where p is the number of bits of possible
further preamble words which follow the said gap, the AW and the UW:


if hd(1)=0 or hd(1)=1, then the first bit of the data packet is situated at a
distance of b(aw+uw)+p bits after the detected first 1-bit;
if hd(2)=0, then the first bit of the data packet is situated at a distance of
b(aw+uw)-1+p bits after the detected first 1-bit;
if hd(3)=0, then the first bit of the data packet is situated at a distance of
b(aw+uw)+p bits after the detected second 1-bit.
System for detecting, from a bit stream, data packets such as
ATM data cells, each data packet being preceded by a preamble which

comprises at least a gap, formed by a number of 0-bits, and a unique word
UW, whose reference value is formed by a specific combination of 0-bits and

1-bits and which has a length of b(uw) bits, 
CHARACTERIZED IN THAT

the UW is preceded by a bit alignment word AW whose reference value is
formed by, beginning with a 1-bit, a specific combination of 0-bits and 1-bits

and which has a length of b(aw) bits, which system, for the purpose of
detecting a subsequent data packet after a first data packet has ended,

comprises the following units;

a first detection unit (1) for detecting, from the said bit stream, the first
1-bit after the said first data packet has ended;
a first computation unit (2) for calculating, for a first detected bit string
B(d1), which begins with the first 1-bit detected by the first detection unit

and has a length b(d1) equal to the number of bits b(aw) of the reference AW 
plus the number of bits b(uw) of the reference UW, the Hamming distance

hd(1) between that first detected bit string B(d1) and a first reference bit
string B(aw+uw) which is equal to the reference AW plus the reference UW;
a pointer unit (3) for indicating the (b(aw)-1)th bit after the detected 1-bit;
a second computational unit (4) for calculating, for a second detected bit
string B(d2), which begins with the bit indicated by the pointer unit,

(b(aw)-1) bits after the first 1-bit detected by the first detection unit, and
which has a length b(d2) equal to the number of bits b(uw) of the reference

UW, the Hamming distance hd(2) between that detected bit string B(d2) and
a second reference bit string B(uw) which is equal to the reference UW;
a second detection unit (5) for detecting the second 1-bit in the bit stream,
after the said first data packet has ended;

unit and has a length b(d3) equal to the number of bits b(aw) of the reference
AW plus the number of bits b(uw) of the reference UW, the Hamming

distance hd(3) between that third detected bit string B(d3) and the third
reference bit string B(aw+uw) which is equal to the reference AW plus the

reference UW;

the said following data packet on the basis of one or more of the Hamming

distances hd(1), hd(2) and hd(3) calculated by one or more of the said
computational units according to the following 
rules, where p is the number
of bits of possible further preamble words which follow the said gap, the AW

and the UW:

if hd(1)=0 or hd(1)=1, then the first bit of the data packet is situated at a
distance of b(aw+uw)+p bits after the detected first 1-bit; 
if hd(2)=0, then the first bit of the data packet is situated at a distance of
b(aw+uw)-1+p bits after the detected first 1-bit;
if hd(3)=0, then the first bit of the data packet is situated at a distance of
b(aw+uw)+p bits after the detected second 1-bit.
