A method of forming a sealed passage (12) in a part of refractory 
composite material (10) comprising a reinforcement constituted by fibers of 

refractory material, densified by a matrix of refractory material, the method 
being characterized in that it comprises the following steps: 


inserting a tubular metal lining with interposed brazing in a hole 
in the part; and 
heating to braze the metal lining to the wall of the hole, thereby 
defining a sealed passage, the metal lining being selected so as to be 

plastically deformable, without losing its integrity, under the conditions of 
use of the part such that differential expansion of thermal origin between the 

refractory composite material and the metal lining can be compensated by 
plastic deformation of the lining, while the mechanical strength of the part is 

ensured by the refractory composite material. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that the part is 
made up of two portions each having a groove for forming said hole when 

said portions are united. 
A structure made of refractory composite material, comprising a 
reinforcement constituted by fibers of refractory material, densified by a 

matrix of refractory material, said structure being suitable for being cooled 
by the flow o
f a fluid, the structure being characterized in that it includes at 
least one element (10) having an internal passage (12) whose wall is sealed 

by a metal lining (14) brazed to the refractory composite material so as to 
enable a cooling fluid to flow along the passage, the metal lining being 

selected so as to be plastically deformable, without losing its integrity, under 
the conditions of use of the part such that differential expansion of thermal 

origin between the refractory composite material and the metal lining can be 
compensated by plastic deformation of the lining, while the mechanical 

strength of the part is ensured by the refractory composite material. 
A thermal protection structure cooled by a flow of a cooling fluid 
for a deflector in an electromagnetic confinement chamber for a plasma in 

an installation for controlled thermonuclear fusion, said structure being 
made up of a plurality of elements (30) of refractory material connected by 

brazing to metal ducts (39) to which are joined pipework (40, 42) for feeding 
and removing a cooling fluid,
  
 

structure characterized in that said elements (30) are of refractory 
composite material, comprising a reinforcement constituted by fibers of 

refractory material, densified by a matrix of refractory material, and each 
having an internal passage (38) whose wall is sealed by a metal lining (39) 

brazed to the refractory composite material, the metal lining being selected 
so as to be plastically deformable, without losing its integrity, under the 

conditions of use of the structure such that differential expansion of thermal 
origin between the refractory composite material and the metal lining can be 

compensated by plastic deformation of the lining, while the mechanical 
strength of the part is ensured by the refractory composite material. 
The structure according to claim 4, characterized in that it 
comprises a plurality of identical unit elements (30) disposed in a plurality of 

lines that substantially follow the profile of the wall of the confinement 
chamber. 
The structure according to any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that each element (10; 30) is in the form of a section bar of 

refractory composite material provided with a longitudinal passage (12; 38). 
The structure according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
section bar is rectilinear. 
The structure according to any one of claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the, or each, passage is curved. 
The structure according to any one of claims 3 to 8, 
characterized in that the metal lining is made of soft copper. 
The structure according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
linings (39) are of soft copper and are joined to the pipework (40; 42) for 

feeding and removing the cooling fluid by means of tubular copper couplings 
(41) welded to the linings and to the pipework.
