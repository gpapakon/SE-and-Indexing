<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the treatment of disease states, and especially AIDS, 
through the administration of antisense and other nucleotide constructs. The 

constructs are administered to the patient in a traditionally pharmaceutical manner, 
or through the use of recombinant retrovirus delivery systems. The latter delivery 

systems preferably target specific cell types or other components one desires to 
target. Such targeting is accomplished by modifying the envelope of a recombinantly 

produced therapeutic retrovirus to contain ligand (receptor) sequences for which a 
receptor (ligand) exists on the cell type or other component in question.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. application Serial 
No. 08/021,936, filed February 25, 1993. This invention relates to the treatment of disease states, and especially AIDS, 
through the administration of antisense and other nucleotide constructs. The 
constructs are administered to the patient in a traditionally pharmaceutical manner, 
or through the use of recombinant retrovirus delivery systems. The latter delivery 
systems preferably target specific cell types or other components one desires to 
target. Such targeting is accomplished by modifying the envelope of a recombinantly 
produced therapeutic retrovirus to contain ligand (receptor) sequences for which a 
receptor (ligand) exists on the cell type or other component in question. A myriad of approaches are currently being investigated for treatment of viral 
infections and other disease states. One of the newest approaches in treating viral 
infections is to use antisense oligonucleotides to selectively block virus replication, 
undesired protein production, and the like, usually by selective, competitive, 
hybridization. For example, Goodchild et. al. in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Vol.85, pp. 
5507-5511 reports on studies to inhibit HIV replication by the use of certain 
antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to twenty different target sites within human 
HIV RNA. The target sites were selected based upon their potential capacity to 
block functions during viral replication. The oligos were about 20 to about 12 base  
 
pairs in length. Some of the oligos were able to demonstrate an inhibitory effect, 
but this varied greatly between the various constructs. None of them stood out as 
particularly superior to the rest, and in fact, the oligos may be too small to 
effectively inhibit all of the areas necessary to achieve acceptable inhibition of the 
virus. Retroviral vectors used as delivery systems to deliver genetic information, including 
antisense, have been suggested to treat nongenetic diseases as well as genetic 
diseases. Tellier et al., Nature 318:414, 1985, suggested protecting T-cell clones 
by infecting stem cells with "defective" HIV, which has a genome that expresses 
antisense RNA, complementary to HIV RNA. However, it appears that this 
recombinant retroviral construct could actually reproduce like a wild-type virus and 
hence, cannot be considered "replication" defective. Using the Tellier techniques, 
newly constructed retroviruses could infect other cells, causing an increased risk of 
recombination with
