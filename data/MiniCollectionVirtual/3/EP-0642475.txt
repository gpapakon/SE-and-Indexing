Process for the manufacture of glass substrates with 
improved long-term stability at elevated temperatures, 

in which process 

(a) a coating composition is applied onto a glass 
substrate, said coating composition having been 

obtained by hydrolysis and condensation of at least 
one compound of at least one element from the group 

Si, Al, Ti and Zr, said compound being liquid 
and/or dissolved in a solvent, and/or of a suitable 

precondensate, optionally in combination with 
compounds of at least one element from the group of 

alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and boron 
which are soluble in the reaction medium, and 

optionally in the presence of a condensation 
catalyst; and 
(b) the coating thus obtained is heat-treated; 
 
characterized in that the coating is not completely 

compacted so that after said heat-treatment it has a 
residual porosity of 1 to 10 percent by volume, said 

porosity including micropores having a pore size of 
≤ 20 nm. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the

in that the coating composition is applied by 

dipping, drawing or spraying. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized 
in that the coating is heat-treated at a 

temperature below the softening point of the base glass, 
preferably below 550°C.
