<ABSTRACT>
The air intake comprises two main flaps (1, 2) face to face and each pivoting about a shaft (4, 5) which is adjacent to a wall (6, 7) extending the flap (1, 2) in question rearwards, and in which a first boundary-layer bleed (8a, 8b) is arranged, the shafts (4, 5) being substantially parallel to the plane of the wings or of the fuselage so that the flaps (1, 2) move perpendicularly to this plane, and a ramp (11) pivoting about a shaft (12) adjacent to its leading edge (11a) by which it is adjacent to the wings and to the fuselage and substantially parallel to the shafts (4, 5) is upstream of the flap (1) closest to the wings and with which it defines another boundary-layer bleed (13) of variable section. Application to the equipping of orbital aeroplanes and of intercontinental supersonic transports.

A two-dimensional variable-geometry supersonic 
and hypersonic air intake, for the combustion air of an 

aircraft engine, placed under the wings (3) or the 
fuselage of the aircraft (A) and comprising two main 

flaps (1, 2) arranged face to face and each movable about 
a pivot pin (4, 5) situated in the vicinity of one wall 

(6, 7) of the air intake which extends the main flap (1, 
2) in question rearwards, in which wall (6, 7) is 

arranged a first boundary layer bleed (8a, 8b), the pivot 
pins (4, 5) of the two main flaps (1, 2) being 

substantially parallel to the plane of the wings (3) or 
of the fuselage, so that the abovementioned main flaps 

(1, 2) move perpendicularly to this plane, characterized 
in that a ramp (11), which is movable about a pivot pin 

(12) substantially parallel to the pivot pins (4, 5) of 
the main flaps (1, 2), and situated in proximity to its 

leading edge (11a), is arranged upstream of the main flap 
(1) closest to the wings or to the fuselage, this 

upstream ramp (11) being adjacent, at its leading edge, 
to the wings (3) or to the fuselage and delimiting, with 

said main flap (1), a boundary layer bleed (13) of 
variable cross section. 
The air intake as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the boundary layer bleed (13) of 

variable cross section may be of zero cross section. 
The air intake as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that the leading edges (1a, 2a) of the 

two main flaps (1, 2) may come substantially into 
contact. 
The air intake as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the boundary 

layer bleed (13) of variable cross section exhibits an 
adjustable passage cross section which is controlled by 

motor means (25, 14) of the upstream ramp (11) and of the 
main flaps (1, 2). 
The air intake as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the actuating 

motor means (25, 14, 15) of the upstream ramp (11) and of  
 

the main flaps (1, 2) are linear actuators installed in 
at least one lateral fairing (16, 17, 18) of the air 

intake in line respectively with the abovementioned 
upstream ramp (11) and with the abovementioned main flaps 

(1, 2), at least one linear actuator (15) acting on at 
least one (2) of the main flaps in the region of at least 

one of lateral flanks (2d) integral with this flap (2). 
The air intake as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the walls (6, 7) 

of the air intake which extend the main flaps (1, 2) 
include fixed compression ramps (6c, 7c), facing each 

other, associated with a fixed diffuser (9). 
The air intake as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that the wall (7) of the air intake 

which extends the main flap (2) not following on from the 
ramp (11) exhibits at least one other boundary layer 

bleed (10b), blocking of which is controlled by motor 
means. 
The air intake as claimed in either claim 6 or 
claim 7, characterized in that the wall (6) of the air 

intake which extends the main flap (1) following on from 
the ramp (11) exhibits at least one other boundary layer 

bleed (10a), blocking of which is controlled by motor 
means.
