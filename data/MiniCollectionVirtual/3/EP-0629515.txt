<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for stitching printed sheets (3) collected on spaced-apart rests (2) of a conveying device (1) exhibits at least one stitching-head pair which rotates above the rests (2) and interacts with the latter and with a bending-over device (42). Each stitching head (5) is designed with a bending device (7), which deforms the fed wire portions (8) to form a clamp, and with a driver (9) which pushes the clamp through the collected printed sheets, the controlled stitching heads (5) being radially displaceably mounted in a guide arrangement (10) of a stitching-head carrier (6) which is driven in rotation, and the bending device (7) exhibiting, at the end which receives the wire portion (8), an opening (12) which is provided for the penetration of a deforming body (11) and is designed as a guide (13) for the clamp (19) and the driver (9).
