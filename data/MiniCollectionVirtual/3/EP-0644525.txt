<ABSTRACT>
An audible sound of modulated wave where a very 
low-frequency wave of about 20 hertz or lower is superposed on 

an audio low-frequency wave effectively stimulates Fm theta in 
human brain waves to improve attention and concentration during 

mental tasks when auditorily administered. The audible sound 
is also effective in stimulation of human alpha wave when the 

very low-frequency wave lies within the range of about 2-10 
hertz. Such audible sound is artificially obtainable by 

generating an electric signal which contains such a modulated 
wave, and transducing it into audible sound wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an audible sound which is 
able to induce Fm theta in human brain waves, as well as to a 
method, device and recorded medium to generate the same. Potential differences observed two different sites in 
the cerebral cortex and scalp are called as "brain waves" which 
have characteristic waveforms and rhythms correspondently to 
mental and physical conditions. Brain waves are usually 
classified into four types, i.e. "alpha wave", "beta wave", 
theta wave" and "delta wave" based on their frequencies. Among 
these, alpha wave, which usually lies in the frequency range of 
8-13 hertz, strongly, extensively and continuously appears as 
mind and body relax. While beta wave, which usually lies in 
the frequency range of 18-30 hertz, strongly and extensively 
appears as mind and body contract. Theta and delta waves, 
which are 4-8 hertz or less than 4 hertz respectively, are 
relevant to hypnosis and sleep: It is said that theta wave 
strongly appears in hypnagogic stage, while delta wave in turn 
becomes predominant as sleep becomes deeper. As seen in Inoeu 
et al., The EEG of Mental Activities, pp.136-148 (1988),  
 
certain theta wave which is observed as predominant rhythm of 
6-7 hertz around the frontal midline in adult is called as "Fm 
theta" and said to be closely relevant to mental tasks. One 
can observe Fm theta appearing around the frontal midline in 
persons who are in mental tasks, and its magnitude and distribution 
become strong and extensive as the persons' attention 
and concentration increase. Since as described above Fm theta is closely connected 
with attention and concentration, if Fm theta is artificially 
induced in workers, then it is expected to improve 
their attention and concentration as well as to improve efficiency 
and accuracy of tasks. There have been however 
available no devices and processes which can be used to artificially 
induce Fm theta. In view of the foregoing, one object of this invention 
is to provide an audible sound which enables artificial 
induction of Fm theta in human when auditorily administered. Another object of this invention is to provide a 
method which enables artificial generation of such audible 
sound. Further object of this invention is to provide a 
device which enables artificial generation of such audible 
sound.  Still further object of this invention is to provide 
a recorded medium which reproduceablly records such audible 
sound. The present inventors studied various means which 
might solve these objects, leading
