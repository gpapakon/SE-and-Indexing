<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an all digital method and apparatus for 
adjustment/regulation of the timing of the occurrence of the rising edges and 
the falling edges of pulses in a pulse train. In data transmission applications, delay elements are frequently used for 
clock synchronization, clock multiplication and clock/data recovery. In recent 
years digital technique's are displacing the analogue circuits which have been 
used in data recovery such as analogue phase locked loops. Digital techniques 
which enable selection of a variable delay length path through a plurality of 
short fixed time delay elements is being used to construct time delays used in 
data recovery circuits. This short fixed time delay element is typically provided 
by the propagation time of a signal through field effect transistors which are 
cascaded to achieve the desired length of delay. However, the delay value 
provided by these transistors are not stable enough for precise applications. 
The delay is a function of the manufacturing process and can vary as a function 
of the temperature and the power supply conditions. One solution to this problem is to calibrate the delay and to design and 
include compensation circuits in the same circuit. Another approach would be 
to provide a method for measuring the delay and adjusting the delays in such 
circuits. Accordingly, delay circuits are needed in which pulse delays are 
measured and adjustable in response thereto. Another problem in data recovery circuits relates to DC balance 
problems which requires modification of the duty cycle of serial data. This  
 
balance problem can result in errors in data recovery if the data is sampled at 
the wrong time as a result of duty cycle distortion. All of these problems can 
be corrected by delay techniques which can selectively and independently 
modify the rising edge and falling edge delays of a pulse transition. We will describe a cascaded delay line circuit which 
enables selective and independent control of both the delay of pulse rising 
transitions and/or pulse falling transitions of a binary signal. The described delay circuit is readily constructed in integrated 
circuit form and includes a falling edge delay block and a rising edge delay 
block and that both falling edge and rising edge blocks are identically 
constructed. Fig. 1 (a) is a schematic diagram of a preferred embodiment 
of the invention. Fig. 1 (b) is a schematic diagram of a unit delay element
