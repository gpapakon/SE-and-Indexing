<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to locks including a body 8 in the form of a slideway 9, a slide 11, and a hook 12 constituting the lock bolt. The lock is characterised in that it includes a spring rod 20 integral, via one of its ends 21, with the slide 11 and including, at its other end 22, a rubbing means 23, and an incline 25 including a sloping part lying between a top 26 and a base 32, the incline being situated on the body 8 and being capable of interacting with the rubbing means (23) so that, when the slide 11 is in an intermediate position between the open position 11-1 and the closed position 11-2, the rubbing means is on the top 26 of the incline and tightens the spring rod 20 and so that, when the slide arrives at its end of travel, the rubbing means runs over the sloping part of this incline and brings the spring rod into the relaxed position.

Lock comprising a body (8) in the form of a guide (9) 
which is hollow (10), a slide (11) mounted to move in translation 

in the hollow of said guide and able to assume two extreme 
positions, a so-called "opening position" (11-1) and "closing 

position" (11-2) and a hook (12) mounted to be integral with said 
slide and emerging from said body through a slot (13) provided 

in this body, this hook constituting the bolt of the lock able 
to cooperate with a projecting part (7) of a keeper (5), 

characterised in that it also comprises at least: 

a spring rod (20) integral, by one of its ends (21), with 
said slide (11) and comprising, at its other end (22), 

friction means (23), and 
a first ramp (25) comprising an inclined part comprised 
between an apex (26) and a base (32), said first ramp being 

situated on said body (8) and being able to cooperate with 
the friction means (23) so that, when said slide (11) is in 

an intermediate position between said opening position (11-1) 
and said closing position (11-2), the said friction 

means are located on the apex (26) of said first ramp and 
stretch said spring rod (20) and that, when said slide 

arrives at the end of its travel, said friction means 
travel over the inclined part of this ramp and bring said 

spring rod into the relaxed position. 
Lock according to Claim 1, characterised in that said 
spring rod (20) is mounted in a direction substantially parallel 

to the sliding direction of said slide (11). 
Lock according to Claim 2, characterised in that it also 
comprises a second ramp (40) substantially symmetrical with said 

first ramp (25) with respect to a direction perpendicular to the 
sliding direction of said slide, the distance, separating the low 

points (32, 42) of these two first and second ramps, being 
substantially equal to the sliding path of said slide when it 

passes from the closing position to the opening position.  
 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the two ramps are formed in the wall (43) of said body (8). 
Lock according to Claim 4, characterised in that the two 
ramps are constituted by a "recess" formed with the wall of said 

body. 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that said spring rod (20) has transverse elasticity and 

longitudinal rigidity.
