<ABSTRACT>
The operation of the minute and hour hands of prior art analog secondary clocks requires an electronic stepping mechanism integrated into each hand. The purpose of the invention is the further design development and simplification of the system by moving both clock hands by means of one stepping mechanism integrated only into the minute hand. The drawing in the figure clarifies the mechanical advance of the hour hand (14) by the minute drive (22) secured to the minute hand (3) via the minute wheel drive (23) and the hour wheel (15) with a reduction ratio of 12:1. The embodiment is specially designed for radio controlled electronic analog secondary clocks with a "jumping second" and a "creeping minute".

Electronic analog secondary clock with a minute hand and an 
hour hand, a minute drive non-rotatably connected to the minute 

hand and an hour wheel non-rotatably connected to the hour hand 
being connected to each other by a gear train with a reduction 

ratio of 12:1 and the time stepping of the minute hand taking 
place due to a stepping machanism connected thereto and rotating 

in synchronism, which drives an eccentric lever weight, 
characterised in that the eccentric lever weight is mounted to 

rotate coaxially with respect to the minute shaft of the stepping 
mechanism by means of a weight holder in a bearing support. 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that connected to the minute shaft of the stepping mechanism is 

a bar, which cooperates with the weight holder and/or the 
eccentric lever weight for its entrainment in the peripheral 

direction. 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the weight holder is bent at its end and enlarged to form 

a fork, in which the bar engages. 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that provided for counterbalancing the minute hand and possibly 

a minute hand carrier are two sliding weights, which are able to 
move in different directions. 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that one sliding weight is able to move in the radial direction 

and the other sliding weight is able to move in the tangential 
direction of the minute hand. 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the sliding weight able to move in the radial direction is 

located on the hand shaft of the minute hand carrier and the 
sliding weight able to move in the tangential direction is 

located on the stepping mechanism, which is attached to the 
minute hand carrier.  

 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that a fixed weight is additionally located on the minute hand 

carrier opposite the stepping mechanism. 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that a rotary weight is provided on the minute hand or the minute 

hand carrier for fine adjustment. 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that a protective housing comprising a base and a cylindrical 

rim is provided, that the hour hand and the minute hand are bent 
over the outer rim of the protective housing towards the wall and 

that the planes of rotation of the tips of the hands lie at a 
short mutual distance exactly above the time marking ring. 
Analog secondary clock according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the time marking ring consists of 4 identical 90Â° 

segments.
