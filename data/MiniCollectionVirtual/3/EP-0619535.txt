<ABSTRACT>
A controls system architecture (110) for an image output terminal (IOT) has a 
hierarchical structure which isolates subsystem controls for purposes of efficient algorithm 

design, analysis and implementation. The architecture is preferably divided into three levels 
(1,2,3) and has a controls supervisor (112) which provides subsystem isolation functions and 

reliability assurance functions. The architecture improves image quality of IOT outputs by 
controlling the operation of the IOT to ensure that a toner reproduction curve of an output 

image matches a tone reproduction curve of an input image, despite several uncontrollable 
variables which change the tone reproduction curve of the output image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hierarchical controls system architecture and method of
controlling an image output by a marking engine of an image output terminal (IOT). The hierarchial
architecture and associated method for controlling image output can be easily implemented in a
wide variety of lOTs, especially in next generation marking engines.GB 2 128 597A discloses a method and apparatus for controlling modular systems. Each
of the individually variable components is associated with an autonomously operating control unit
provided with setpoints from a common master computer.The controls system architecture for lOTs that output only black images (non-color lOTs)
provide good IOT design using comparatively simple process control loops. While the methods and
techniques developed for the marking engines of black only lOTs are successful, they cannot be
used effectively with the marking engines of color lOTs. Color lOTs are required to produce high
quality pictorial color images using several different primary colors. The process controls required
for the color marking engines need to be significantly more complex as compared to the process
controls for black only marking engines. Furthermore, as the popularity of color lOTs has increased
rapidly, there is also greater customer demand for color quality and more stable and predictable
output of the color IOT. Since precise control of multiple parameters is required to stabilize color
lOTs, the available process data needs to be used effectively. The control of the color lOTs is
complicated by the fact that multiple development subsystems are used in the color printing process
rather than only one development subsystem used in black only lOTs. Moreover, if a tandem
engine is used, control of four complete xerographic modules is required.Thus, the traditional difficulties associated with the control of color lOTs along with the
public demand for increased IOT image quality and reliability require a more complex controls
system and a more comprehensive design for the controls system.In digital laser printing and reproducing operations, a continuous tone image cannot be
identically reproduced because of the limitations of the laser in the printer. The laser cannot
identically match the continuous tone image because there are two sources which limit the ability of
the IOT to write the continuous tone images on the photoreceptor. The first source of limitation is
the difficulty in reliably determining which value of intensity of laser power should be used
