<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for leak testing a waterproof garment with respect 
to ingress of liquid water. Waterproof garments, such as oil skins, have been 
known for many years. Whilst these protect the wearer 
against water penetration, they are uncomfortable to wear 
since they are unable to allow perspiration from the body 
to escape, so that the inside of the garment becomes 
clammy. More recently, fabrics have become available 
which resist the ingress of liquid water, yet at the same 
time allow water vapour to pass through. One such fabric 
is available under the trademark GORE-TEX and comprises an 
expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane. 
Typically, the fabric comprises a porous expanded PTFE 
membrane laminated to a woven fabric (typically nylon or 
polyester) which protects the outside of the membrane. 
GORE-TEX fabric is generally a three-layer construction 
which further includes an open knitted material laminated 
to the inside of the porous expanded PTFE membrane, which 
protects the membrane and improves the feel of the 
fabric. The fabric is used to produce waterproof 
breathable garments in substantially conventional  
 
manner. However, in order to prevent water penetration 
at the seams of the garment, it is normal to apply a heat 
bonded tape over the inside of the seams. The heated tape 
is applied under pressure to the seam, such that the 
melted adhesive penetrates the inner knitted layer of the 
fabric and bonds to the PTFE membrane itself, thereby 
sealing the seam against water penetration. Waterproof breathable garments find application in a 
variety of fields, including industrial clothing, leisure 
clothing and military clothing. A wide variety of 
garments may be produced, including socks, mitts, jackets, 
suits, trousers, overalls, bib-and-brace overalls etc. 
However, one particularly important application is in the 
construction of aviation survival suits termed Over Water 
Flying Suits (OWFS). These suits are worn by pilots and 
passengers undertaking over water flights, such as Air 
Force Personnel and Crews servicing offshore installations 
such as oil rigs. It is a requirement that over water flying suits be 
washed and tested for water tightness every week or two 
during use. The OWFS must be capable of keeping dry a 
person who has accidentally come down in the sea for a 
period of at least half an hour. This is important in 
cold Northern seas in order to prevent hypothermia prior 
to rescue. One test standard

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for leak-testing a garment (2) for ingress 
of liquid water, with the garment turned inside-out, which 

apparatus comprises; 

closure means (4, 26, 28) for closing openings in 
the garment such as to allow the garment to be 

inflated; 
spray means (16, 18) for spraying the inner surface 
of the closed garment with liquid water; and 
pressurising means for inflating the closed garment 
by gas pressure and for forcing the sprayed liquid 

water through any leaks in the garment. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the closure 
means includes a plug (4) for fitting into the neck of the 

garment, and clamping means (36, 38, 40, 42) for clamping 
the neck in place. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein the 
spray means comprises pipes (6, 8, 10, 12, 14) for 

supplying liquid water and pressurised gas passing through 
the closure means (4) and terminating in spray nozzles (16, 

18) located in use within the garment. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein the garment is 
a suit (2) and the spray nozzles (18) direct spray into the 

arms and legs of the suit.  
 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim which 
further comprises means (48, 50) for tilting the inflated 

garment from a substantially horizontal position to an 
upright position for leak inspection. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim which 
comprises means for regulating the gas pressure inside the 

garment to a predetermined value. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim which 
further comprises restraint means (70) for enclosing the 

garment and avoiding over-stretching of the garment during 
inflation; the restraint means having an open or 

transparent construction allowing inspection for leaks. 
Apparatus according to claim 7 wherein the restraint 
means is in the form of a rigid cage (70). 
Apparatus according to claim 7 or 8 wherein the 
restraint means (70) is smaller than the garment to avoid 

over-stretching. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the closure 
means includes a plug (4) for fitting into an opening in 

the garment and clamping means (36, 38, 40, 42) for 
clamping the garment opening around the plug, and
 
   the spray means comprises pipes (44, 46) for supplying 

liquid water and pressurised gas passing through the  
 

closure plug and terminating in spray nozzles (18) located 
in use within the garment. 
A process for leak-testing a waterproof garment for 
ingress of liquid water, which comprises; 


closing openings in the garment such as to allow the 
garment to be inflated; 
simultaneously or sequentially pressurising and 
inflating the closed garment by gas pressure, and 

spraying the inner surface of the closed garment with 
liquid water; and 
examining the surface of the inflated garment for 
liquid water forced through any leaks in the garment. 
A process according to claim 11 wherein the garment is 
first inflated in a substantially horizontal position and 

then pivoted to an upright position. 
A process according to any of claims 11 and 12 which 
further comprises the step of providing a substantially 

inelastic restraint means around the garment to prevent 
over-stretching during inflation.
