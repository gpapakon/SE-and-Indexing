<ABSTRACT>
An electroless process has been developed to deposit nickel and gold 
onto optical fibers using aqueous chemistry. The key to the process is a sensitization 

of a surface of an optical fiber using a dilute aqueous stannous fluoride solution in 
absence of oxygen. Stannous fluoride solution is prepared by dissolving crystalline 

SnF₂ in deionized water. Subsequent treatment includes immersion of sensitized 
optical fiber in a palladium chloride/HCl aqueous solution and commercially 

available electroless nickel and electroless gold solutions. The process is compatible 
with either chemical or fusion lensing operations by using a strippable polymer 

coating to selectively metallize near the fiber end. The solder joints to the metallized 
fiber are hermetic as determined by helium leak testing, and solder pull-test strengths 

typically range from 3-5 pounds, depending on the type of solder. This electroless 
plating process for metallizing optical fibers makes feasible the incorporation of 

soldered fiber into packages which might be otherwise prohibitively expensive or 
mechanically infeasible with the sputtered metallization. The process is useful for 

all lightwave components which require either hermeticity or high reliability optical 
fiber attachment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns formation of metallizations on optical fibers by 
electroless plating. In fiber-optic technology many applications require an ability to solder 
to an optical fiber, either for alignment to such optical devices as lasers and 
photodetectors or in hermetic packaging. One currently employed technique to 
accomplish this task is to sputter metal onto the fiber. Sputtered metallizations on 
fibers, such as titanium, platinum and gold metallizations, are being used in 
submarine and terrestrial lightwave as well as in cable TV projects 
(see for example EP-A-497 489). This approach is 
not only expensive but also produces a non-uniform coating, tends to weaken the 
fiber, and puts limitations on the type of polymer jacketing that can be used in the 
vacuum of the sputtering chamber. Other approaches to hermetic bonding to fibers 
require high-temperature processing, such as the Englehard platinum ink process 
(670°C), or a low-melting glass made by Schott Fiber Optics (480°C). A process 
for depositing metal on optical fibers at low temperature and without the need for a 
high-vacuum operation would be more technically and economically advantageous. 
One technology has been used in the past to metallize such dielectric surfaces as 
glass by an electroless deposition of nickel. A glass surface is prepared for the 
electroless deposition of nickel by applying onto the surface a sensitizer which acts 
to deposit a catalyst for the nickel reduction from an electroless nickel plating 
solution. For example, an aqueous solution of stannous chloride (SnCl2) applied to 
a glass surface, such as a microscope slide, will coat the surface with Sn2+ ions. 
When this sensitized surface is exposed to a solution of Pd2+ ions, an oxidation-reduction 
reaction occurs in which the tin ion is oxidized to Sn4+ and the palladium 
ion is reduced to palladium metal (Pd0). When this activated surface is subsequently 
exposed to a solution of Ni2+ and a reducing agent, such as sodium hypophosphite, 
the palladium (Pd0) catalyzes the reduction of nickel ion to nickel metal (Ni0), 
which is itself a catalyst for its own reduction (see for example 
FR-A-2 486 064). A variation of this technique using SnF2 instead of 
SnCl2 has also been proposed (see FR-A-1 562 392) Unfortunately, although SnCl2 and SnF2 work adequately as sentizers for 
glass surfaces, it has not been possible to obtain reproducible, uniform plating of 
nickel on silica fibers using these standard approaches. Thus, a reliable process for the
