<ABSTRACT>
A cardiac pacemaker with an analog telemetry system. A calibration circuit within the pacemaker is adapted to provide a reference signal of known character to the pacemaker's telemetry system. The reference signal is transmitted across the telemetry link as if it were an actual cardiac signal, and received by an external programmer. Since the reference signal has known, predetermined qualities, the programmer can automatically calibrate and scale the telemetry signal from the pacemaker, thereby increasing the accuracy of the telemetry channel. The increased accuracy is particularly useful in assessing rejection of a transplanted heart, which is known to be associated with a 15 % decline in the peak R-wave amplitude of the cardiac signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of cardiac pacemakers, and 
is particularly applicable to a pacemaker having an automatic 
calibration signal for an analog telemetry channel. As of January 1, 1991, over 16,000 heart transplants have taken place worldwide, 
more than 87% of these since 1984 (according to Kreitt et al., "The Registry of the 
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: Eight Annual Report", The 
Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation, Number 4, July-August 1991, pp. 491 - 
498). Rejection of the transplanted heart within two years is the cause of death in 
40% or more of all cases. Currently, the preferred method for monitoring rejection 
is by serial transvenous endomyocardial biopsy. Such a procedure is invasive and 
relatively traumatic, and must usually be performed at specialized facilities. 
Typically, two such tests are performed during the first six post-implant months; 
thereafter, the tests are given less frequently, but throughout the patient's lifetime. 
Up to a day may be required to obtain results from such a test. One known 
shortcoming of the serial transvenous endomyocardial biopsy in evaluating heart 
rejection is that existing scar tissue in the heart, which can occur for various reasons 
other than heart rejection, can be erroneously interpreted as indicating rejection. 
It has also been found, however, that certain features of the electrical cardiac signal in 
transplant patients may also be utilized as an indicator of heart rejection. See, e.g., 
Warnecke et al., "Noninvasive Monitoring of Cardiac Allograft Rejection by 
Intramyocardial Electrogram Recordings", Circulation 74 (suppl. III), III-72 - III-76, 
1986. In particular, it has been found that the onset of heart rejection is accompanied 
by a reduction of up to 15% in the magnitude of intracardiac R-wave and T-wave 
peaks. See, e.g., Rosenbloom et al., "Noninvasive Detection of Cardiac Allograft 
Rejection by Analysis of the Unipolar Peak-to-Peak Amplitude of Intramyocardial  
 
Electrograms", Ann. Thorac. Surg., 1989;47:407-411; see also, e.g., Grace et al., 
"Diagnosis of Early Cardiac Transplant Rejection by Fall in Evoked T Wave 
Amplitude Measured Using an Externalized QT Driven Rate Responsive Pacemaker", 
PACE, vol. 14, June 1991. The ability to monitor and detect this phenomenon would 
therefore facilitate the early detection and treatment of rejection. To this end, an 
implantable pacemaker with an accurate analog telemetry channel for transmitting 
intracardiac signals would
