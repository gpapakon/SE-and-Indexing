<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an ointment composition for 
prophylaxis and treatment of premature ejaculation in a male 

patient and more particularly to a composition for applying to 
the glans penis, which contains the alcohol and/or aqueous extracts 

of ginseng radix, angelicae gigantis radix, broomrape, 
cassiae cortex, asiasari radix and bufonis venenum as the essential 

galenic components and, if necessary, one or more additional 
components selected from the extracts of xanthoxyli fructus, 

cnidium fructus, caryophylli flos and moschus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition
for the prophylaxis and treatment of premature ejaculation.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a galenic
composition for the prophylaxis and treatment of male ejaculation
accommodation ataxia due to sexual nervous hypersensitivity and
to a process for preparing said galenic composition.The nervous system of the human body can be classified into
the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.
Nervous hypersensitivity (neuroticism) is generally caused by a
disorder of the physico-neurological system which is under the
influence of the central nervous system. However, sexual nervous
hypersensitivity is mainly caused by a disorder in the complex
cooperation between the peripheral nervous system and the central
nervous system. Meanwhile, with the advance of modern civilization
and the development of scientific technique an activation of
the central nervous system is preferentially necessary for
achieving high mental activities, such as the adaptation to novel
scientific techniques, maintenance of smooth human relations and 
to maintain social discipline rather than to pursue the instinctive
physical satisfaction in, for example, the necessities of
life and sexual desire.Such complicated social life results in a destruction of the
balance and smooth cooperation of central nervous system and
peripheral nervous system. Particularly, in men, this may cause
a loss of the ability to achieve sexual accommodation which is
necessary for the satisfaction of the human instinctive desire.
Recently, it has been determined that the number of cases manifesting
various symptoms caused by such loss of sexual accommodation
is rather large.According to statistics, it has been shown that although
there is some differences between age groups, approximately 30 to
50% of Korean adult men visiting to impotence clinic suffer from
sexual hypersensitivity. The typical example of sexual hypersensitivity
is premature ejaculation, which is the main reason for
sexual problems and which leads to social difficulties, such as
asthenia due to the loss of self-confidence, as well as domestic
discord. Premature ejaculation is defined as persistent or
recurrent ejaculation before, upon, or shortly after penetration.The reasons for premature ejaculation is generally thought
to include a malfunction of the repressor center due to the
fatigue of nervous transmission, hypersensitivity of a specific
site due to genital disorders, hormonal disorders, physical
