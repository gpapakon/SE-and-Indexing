<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an X-ray examination apparatus comprising a patient-bearing table that is pivotable about a first axis (3), a spot-film device (6) which is located above the table top (4) of the patient-bearing table and can be displaced by a transport device (10) parallel to the table top, as well as an X-ray emitter (2) for generation of an X-radiation beam, which emitter is coupled to the transport device. Use of the X-ray emitter located underneath the table top for overtable radiography is permitted in that the X-ray emitter is pivotable about a second axis (12) connected to the transport device and parallel to the first axis.

<CLAIMS>
An X-ray examination apparatus, including a patient table (22) which is
pivotable about a first axis (3), a spot film device (6) which is arranged over the top (4) of

the patient table and can be displaced parallel to the table top by means of a transport
device (10), and also comprising an X-ray source (2) which is coupled to the transport

device, 
characterized in that
 the X-ray source (2) is pivotable about a second axis (12)
which is connected to the transport device (10), or to a part (9) rigidly connected thereto,

and extends, parallel to the plane of the table top (4) and parallel to the first axis, from a
position in line with the spot film device (6) to a position over the table top (4).
An X-ray examination apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the second axis (12) is situated at a distance from a plan (13), which extends
perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the table top and contains the focus of the

X-ray source (2) in a position underneath the table top.
An X-ray examination apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that

underneath the table top (4) there is provided a moving grid device (14) which can be
coupled to the movement of the X-ray spot film device (6) in the longitudinal direction.
An X-ray examination apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the X-ray source (2) is pivotable about a third axis (18) which extends parallel to the first
and the second axis (12) and through the focus of the X-ray source (2), that the X-ray

source (2) is coupled to a stationary point (17) on the X-ray apparatus via a coupling rod
(16), and that means (19) are provided for motor-driven displacement of the X-ray source

(2) in the longitudinal direction of the patient table (22).
