<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a safety cut-off device especially for a vehicle with a circuit breaker (10) interposed on the electric circuit immediately downstream of the energy storage means, comprising a ball (17) made of an electrically conducting material located between a first ball-support element and a second ball-support element, these both also being made of conducting material, pressed towards each other by elastic return elements so as to make contact, the said ball being capable of escaping from the ball-support elements under the effect of substantial deceleration resulting from an impact so as to cut off the power supply to the functional members, and this circuit breaker is characterised in that it comprises a main electrical safety circuit (83, 84) connected to the complementary safety members or refinements with at least one contactor interposed between this electrical safety circuit and at least the first ball-support element which is connected to the means for storing the electricity produced, this contactor being triggered by the movements, at least, of this first ball-support element.

Safety circuit-breaker device, notably for a vehicle
equipped with a thermal engine using a flammable fuel,

this vehicle being equipped with an electrical circuit
comprising electricity production means (63), means (50)

for storing the electricity produced, functional
components (56, 59, 62, 64) directly attached to the

engine, as well as complementary safety (77) or comfort
(71) components fed with electrical energy from the

storage means, this device comprising a circuit breaker
(10) designed to be interposed on the electrical circuit

immediately downstream of the electricity storage means,
comprising a ball (17) disposed between first and second

elements (14, 14') supporting the ball, pressed towards
each other by elastic return means (19, 19') so as to

make contact, said ball being able to escape from the
ball-support elements under significant deceleration

resulting from an impact so as to cut off the power
supply to the functional components, the device

comprising a main safety electrical circuit (83, 84)
designed to be connected to the complementary safety (77)

or comfort (71) components, with at least one contactor
(18, 22; 18', 22'), this contactor being triggered at

least by the movements of said first ball-support
element, characterised in that the ball (17) and the ball

supports are made from electrically conductive material
so as to make contact, and in that the contactor (18, 22;

18', 22') is interposed between this safety electrical
circuit and at least the first ball-support element (14) 

designed to be connected to the means (50) for storing
the electricity produced.
Safety circuit-breaker device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that it comprises a supplementary safety

electrical circuit (87), connected in parallel with the
main safety electrical circuit (83, 84), this

supplementary safety electrical circuit being connected
on the one hand to the contactor (22, 22') of the main

safety electrical circuit, and therefore to the first
ball-support element (14) when this contactor is closed,

and on the other hand able to be connected to
supplementary safety devices (88).
Safety circuit-breaker device according to Claim 2,
characterised in that the supplementary safety components

(88) comprise notably inflatable safety bags, automatic
safety-belt release systems, an extinguishing system or a

safety beacon.
Safety circuit-breaker device according to Claim 1, 2
or 3, characterised in that it comprises a visual safety

signalling system (31), comprising a self-contained low-voltage
electricity source (32), hazard warning lights

(90) and a contactor (40) triggered by the movements at
least of the second ball-support element (14').
Safety circuit-breaker device according to Claim 4,
characterised in that the hazard warning lights (90) are

able to be disposed inside the vehicle passenger
compartment, behind the front and rear windows so as to

protect them. 
Safety circuit-breaker device according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the first and

second ball-support elements (14, 14') comprise means
(15, 22) for supplying the main and supplementary safety

circuits, triggered as soon as the ball (17) first moves,
before the complete ejection of the ball (17) out of the

ball-support elements (14, 14') in the internal space
(16) of the circuit breaker (10).
Safety circuit-breaker device according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the first and

second elements (14, 14') have a mushroom shape with a
body and head (15, 15'), each of these heads being

provided with a concave housing (29, 29') intended to
receive the ball (17).
Safety circuit-breaker device according to Claim 7,
characterised in that the heads (15, 15') each comprise

an annulus (30, 30') made of insulating material,

disposed at its periphery.
Safety circuit-breaker device according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the upper

(11') and lower (11'') parts of the casing (11) comprise
dedicated directional contacts (92) for providing

triggering of some of the safety elements depending on
the orientation of the resultant of the impact.
Safety circuit-breaker device according to any one
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the upper 

(11') and lower (11'') parts are welded to each other so
that this circuit breaker is for use only once.
