<ABSTRACT>
A first object, which comprises organic material, is bonded to a second 
object by a method whereby both objects are provided with complementary optically 

smooth surfaces, subsequent to which these surfaces are brought into substantial contact 
with one another, consequent upon which spontaneous atomic bonds are formed between 

atoms of the two objects. The strength of the atomic bonds thus formed can be increased 
by subsequently heating the region of contact of the two surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of bonding a first object, which comprises 
organic material, to a second object. Such methods are well known from common experience, and may involve 
application of an adhesive substance to a surface of at least one of the two objects, 
subsequent to which this surface is held in contact with a complementary surface of the 
other object, whereby a chemical bond is formed between the two surfaces. Appropriate 
adhesive substances for this purpose are manifold, and include pastes, putties, cements, 
resins and glues, all demonstrating a wide range of chemical, mechanical, thermal, 
electrical and optical characteristics. A disadvantage of these known methods is that they result in the permanent 
presence of a foreign substance (i.e. the adhesive substance) between the bonded 
surfaces of the two objects. Intended application of the objects in a precision device 
may thus place stringent demands on the characteristics of the adhesive substance used. 
For example, if the thermal expansivity of the adhesive substance is not carefully matched 
to that of the objects to be bonded, then exposure of the bonded objects to large or 
sudden changes in temperature may result in partial or complete severance of their 
bonded surfaces, due to the mechanical stresses arising from differential thermal 
expansion. Alternatively, application of the bonded objects in an ultra-high vacuum 
environment will necessitate use of an adhesive substance having a sufficiently low 
vapour pressure, so as to minimise outgassing. Furthermore, in applications requiring 
highly accurate mutual positioning of the two objects, such as the manufacture of 
integrated circuits or precision optics, allowances must be made for the thickness of the 
interfacial adhesive substance itself, especially since this will usually be inhomogeneous. These considerations often necessitate the development of special adhesive  
 
substances for particular applications, at high cost. Such adhesive substances are often 
toxic and inflammable, so that care must be exercised both in their application and in 
their disposal. Moreover, many such adhesive substances contain solvents which can 
seriously degrade the surfaces of organic materials. A further disadvantage of the known methods is that they often do not 
provide an instant bond between the two objects. Rather, the objects must be held in 
motionless contact for an extended interval of time, so as to allow sufficient setting of 
the adhesive substance and consequent
