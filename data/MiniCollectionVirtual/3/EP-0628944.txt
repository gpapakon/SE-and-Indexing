<ABSTRACT>
A plasma-addressed display device which achieves 
both of suppression of abnormal discharge and 

stabilization of a discharge potential of a plasma cell. 
The plasma-addressed display device comprises a display 

cell having a plurality of data electrodes therein, a 
plasma cell associated with the display cell and having 

a plurality of addressing channels in a direction 
perpendicular to the data electrodes. Each channel has 

a pair of electrodes which comprise a coated electrode 
coated with a dielectric material layer and an exposed 

electrode. A driving circuit applies data voltages to 
the respective data electrodes on the basis of a 

reference potential, and a scanning circuit controls the 
application of strobe pulses to the addressing channels. 

The scanning circuit has switching means for switching 
from the application of an anode potential to the coated 

electrode and the application of a cathode potential to 
the exposed electrode to the application of the cathode 

potential to the coated electrode and the application of 
the anode potential equal to the reference potential to 

the exposed electrode when one of the channels is 
addressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plasma-addressed
display device which includes a flat panel including a
display cell such as a liquid crystal cell and a plasma
cell placed one on the other, and more particularly to
the structure of a plasma cell of a plasma-addressed
display device of the type mentioned which addresses a
display cell by selective plasma discharging.A plasma-addressed display device is disclosed,
for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,896,149 and U.S.
Patent No. 5,077,553 which correspond to Japanese
Published Unexamined (Kokai) Patent Application No. 1-217396
and is shown in FIG. 8. Referring to FIG. 8, the
plasma-addressed display device shown has a layered flat
panel structure which includes a display cell 101, a
plasma cell 102 and a common intermediate sheet 103
interposed between the liquid crystal cell 101 and the
plasma cell 102. The plasma cell 102 is formed using a
lower substrate 104 which has a plurality of parallel
grooves 105 formed on a surface thereof. The grooves 
105 are closed up by the intermediate sheet 103 to
individually define scanning channels 106 which are
individually separate from each other. Each adjacent
ones of the scanning channels 106 are isolated from each
other by a barrier rib 107. Ionizable gas is enclosed
in the scanning channels 106. A pair of parallel
electrodes 108 and 109 are formed to extend in the
longitudinal direction of the grooves 105 on a bottom
surface of each of the grooves 105. The pair of
electrodes 108 and 109 are made of a metal material and
individually function as an anode and a cathode to
ionize the gas in the corresponding scanning channel 106
to produce discharge plasma.Meanwhile, the display cell 101 is constructed
using an upper substrate 110. A liquid crystal layer
111 is filled between the upper substrate 110 and the
intermediate substrate 103. A plurality of data
electrodes 112 each formed from a transparent conductive
film are formed on an inner surface of the upper
substrate 110 and extend in parallel to each other. The
data electrodes 112 extend perpendicularly to the
scanning channels 106, and picture elements arranged in
a matrix are defined at intersecting positions between
the data electrodes 112 and the scanning channels 106. In order to drive the plasma addressed display
device described above, plasma discharge is produced in
a line sequential condition in the individual scanning
channels 106. To this end, the potential to a cathode
relative to an anode is controlled so that the absolute
value thereof may be higher than the
