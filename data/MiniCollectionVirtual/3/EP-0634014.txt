<ABSTRACT>
A method for the direct analysis of analyte indicative of marijuana exposure found in keratinized structures, e.g., hair, fingernails and toenails, which comprises preparing a mixture containing dithiothreitol or dithioerythritol, a protease suitable for the digestion of the keratin structure and a sample of the keratin structure; permitting the enzyme to at least substantially digest the sample of keratin structure to form a digest solution, followed by mixing the digest solution with a suspension of an ion exchange resin to remove an interfering, cross reacting substance naturally found in hair and finally subjecting the digest solution to analysis to determine the identity and amount of marijuana analyte in the keratin structure sample. To accelerate the method, cupric sulfate may be added to the mixture after degradation of the keratin sample in order to deactivate the activator. The enzyme may be a protease with papain, chymopapain, and proteinase K being preferred for use in the invention. Exemplary ion exchange resins useful in the method according to the invention are DEAE Sephadex (Diethylaminoethyl Sephadex) and DEAE Sepharose (Diethylaminoethyl Sepharose).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved analytical method
which effectuates the relatively rapid solubilization of
hair and analysis of marijuana analyte
present in hair
without effecting the
structure of the analyte or being detrimental to biological
analyte probes.
Marijuana analyte can be analyzed by adding an antibody
to the solubilized hair sample
containing marijuana analyte and determine
the extent and duration of its
consumption by a subject. In the past, hair analysis techniques for the detection of
trace metals were developed that purported to provide
information on an individual's nutritional status. One
objection to the use of these techniques is the difficulty
of distinguishing between trace metals deposited in hair
from the bloodstream and metals which have become embedded
in hair through external contact with, for example, water
and cosmetic agents. Consequently, these techniques are not
considered useful by the medical community for diagnosing
nutritional problems, and therefore have not been considered
sufficiently accurate to determine the level of a particular
trace metal consumed by a subject.The problems with previous hair analysis techniques have
caused reliance on urine and blood analysis techniques for
the detection of ingested chemicals, e.g., drugs-of-abuse,
medications and toxic chemicals, in a subject. However,
these techniques also are known to be disadvantageous in
that the duration and intensity of use or exposure cannot be
ascertained. Urine and blood analysis, at best, can provide
short term information concerning ingested drugs or
chemicals such as drugs-of-abuse. In addition, there are
also problems with the interpretation of such results. For
example, the detection of a low level of ingested chemical
in the urine could mean that a subject ingested a small
amount of the drug or chemical very recently or a larger
amount several days earlier. Thus, chronic drug use cannot
be determined with these methods without repeated testing.In response to the problems of establishing a reliable and
accurate method that would measure both the duration and
intensity of use of drugs-of-abuse, medications, toxic
chemicals, etc., work performed by Dr. Werner A.
Baumgartner, as reported in "Radioimmunoassay of Hair for
Determining Opiate Abuse Histories", J. Nucl Med 20:749-752 
(1979), determined that long-term histories of exposure to
drugs-of-abuse can be obtained through the analysis of
mammalian body hair, since these substances are "trapped"
within individual hair fibers during their

A method for the detection of marijuana
intake by an individual which comprises:


(a) chemically treating a sample of hair from
the individual in a manner that releases an

analyte which has become embedded in the
hair from the bloodstream of the subject as

a result of marijuana ingestion to form a
test solution; said solution containing a

lipidic interfering cross reaction substance
naturally found in hair;
(b) preparing a suspension of an ion exchange
resin in a concentration and amount

sufficient to remove the interfering
substance from the test solution such that

the analyte may be detected by immunoassay
using an antibody which specifically binds

to cannabinoids;
(c) mixing the test solution and the suspension
sufficient to remove the interfering

substance from the test solution; and
(d) after the interfering substance has been
substantially removed from the test

solution, subjecting a portion of the
solution to analysis by immunoassay using an

antibody which specifically binds to
cannabinoids to detect the analyte if

present.
