<DESCRIPTION>
PROCESS FOR REGENERATING A CATALYST AND RESULTANT REGENERATED CATALYST AND PRODUCTION OF OLEFINS BY CATALYTIC ETHER DECOMPOSITION USING REGENERATED CATALYST1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to methods for producing olefins by catalytic decomposition of ether precursors, ethers, alcohols and mixtures thereof. Specifically, the present invention is directed to processes for regenerating catalysts and particularly decomposition catalysts used in methods for decompositions ethers, alcohols and mixtures thereof to produce olefins.2. Disc ssion Q_t Background and/or Material Informat on10 Tertiary olefins are in general commercially produced by the sulfuric acid extraction of such olefins from mixtures containing them obtained e.g., by steam cracking of petroleum feeds.Tertiary olefins may be prepared by reacting them15 selectively from such feeds with a primary alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to produce the corresponding alkyl tβrt-alkyl ethers; only the tert-alkyl ethers are formed since the secondary olefins react very slowly and the primary olefins are completely inert. Such alkyl tert-alkyl20 ethers may then be easily separated and subsequently decomposed back to the tertiary olefins and the primary alcohol.Although it is disclosed that the clay of the catalyst is preferably washed first with water and then with methanol25 before calcining (column 2, lines 43-45), this washing refers to that which is conducted after the clay is reacted with the acid, and does not refer to a washing which is conducted for the purpose of regenerating a deactivated catalyst which has been taken off-line due to becoming contaminated with30 foulants, after some time on stream.U.S. Patent No. 2,784,238, discloses regenerating a clay catalyst by washing the catalyst with a polar oxygenated 

solvent until the resins absorbed on the catalyst are dissolved. However, the clay catalyst is used in the production of resorcinals by the decompositions of hydroper oxides, and does not regenerate the catalyst in situ. U. S . Patent Nos. 3 ,472 , 786 and 4 , 469 , 805, disclosed the use of a methanol wash to regenerate clays used as absorbents for "treating hydrocarbons; however, the clays are not disclosed as being useful as catalysts for any reaction.Japanese Patent Mo. JP60-075331 , discloses the regeneration, of a layered clay catalyst by washing the clay with an aqueous mixture including 50-98% of an organic medium, such as methanol or ethanol, and discloses that the layered catalyst is for use in
