<DESCRIPTION>
 Cephalosporins and l-carba-l-deth1a cephalosporlnsThis invention relates to novel β-lactam compounds, their preparation and their use, and in particular to a novel class of cephalosporins. These compounds have antibacterial properties, and are therefore of use in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals caused by a wide range of organisms.EP 0487996 Al (Bayer AG) discloses cephems of general formula (A):(A) wherein Ra, and RD arc various substituents, and Rc is a ring system selected from:
 where A and D may be the same or different and may be CH=CH, oxygen or sulphur, and Ra and RD may be various substituents.We have found a particularly advantageous class of cephems and carbacephems bearing a bicyclic substituent at the 3-position of the cephem nucleus, which includes a 5- or 6- membered cyclic ether or cyclic thio-ether moiety.The present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof:
 ω wherein:R! is hydrogen, methoxy or formamido;R2 is an acyl group, in particular that of an antibacterially active cephalosporin;CO2R3 is a carboxy group or a carboxylate anion, or R^ is a readily removable carboxy protecting group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt-forming group or in vivo hydrolysable ester group;X is S, SO, SO2 orCH2;R is a bicyclic group 

 where m is 1 or 2; wherein one of Y or Z is O, S, SO or SO2 and the other is CH2, and wherein R^ may be unsubstituted or may have one or more optional substituents R^, which may be present on any of the carbon atoms in the bicyclic ring system shown, selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, amino, alkylamino, acylamino, dialkylamino, CO2R, OCOR, CONR2, SO2NR2 nere R is hydrogen or alkyl; aryl and heterocyclyl, which may be the same or different and wherein any R^ alkyl substituent is optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from the list from which R^ is selected, in place of any of the hydrogen atoms in the bicyclic system.The bonding carbon atom of the heterocyclic moiety of R^ which links R^ to the cephalosporin nucleus is generally asymmetric. The present invention includes either stereoisomer, as well as mixtures of both isomers. In compounds of formula (I) wherein R is formamido, the formamido group can exist in conformations wherein the hydrogen atoms of the -NH-CHO moiety are cis- or trans-: of these the cj conformation normally predominates.Since the compounds of the present invention are intended for use as therapeutic agents for antibacterial use in pharmaceutical
