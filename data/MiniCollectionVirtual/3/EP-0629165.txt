<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ram air turbines for
incorporation on aircraft in a normally stowed condition.For many years, aircraft have included as
standard equipment, backup power supplied for use in times
of power outage in the form of air driven turbines or fans.
These turbines or fans are lowered into the airstream,
thereby making use of the relative speed of the aircraft
through the ambient air to cause the turbine or fan blades
to rotate. The rotation imparted to the blades is then
used to drive electrical generating gear or provide
hydraulic power to the aircraft hydraulic system, or both
during a power outage.Conventionally, these devices are known as ram
air turbines and include governor mechanisms that provide
a measure of control over the output rotational speed
delivered from the blade to the electrical or hydraulic
units corresponding to the most efficient operating speed
of such units.One example of such a unit is illustrated in
United States Letters Patent 4,411,596 issued October 25,
1983 to Chilman, entitled "Ram Air Turbine Control System"
and assigned to the same Assignee of the instant
application
which discloses all features mentioned in the preamble of claim 1.
The Chilman device is successful for its
intended purpose. However, because it employs fly weights
which are used during startup of the device in addition to
counterweights for the turbine blades, the same is larger 
than desired. Needless to say, in aircraft usages, bulk
and weight are always of concern as is cost. Clearly, it
would be desirable to reduce each.A primary reason for the configuration of the
Chilman device is that it provides a mechanism that may be
stored out of the airstream with its blades in a coarse
pitch position. When the blades are in coarse pitch
position, the achievable speed is minimal. Consequently,
if the blades are stuck in one pitch position, due to ice
or corrosion, when the ram air turbine is deployed after
the blades have been stored in the coarse pitch position,
the unit will not overspeed and self-destruct as might
occur if the blades were stuck in a fine pitch position.In normal starting, when the ram air turbine
blades increase in rotational speed, the blades are
conventionally transitioned from coarse pitch to fine pitch
by the fly weights which move an entire spring carriage
assembly. After that is accomplished, the turbine
accelerates to a speed in the normal governing range and
the primary governor, a counterweight associated with the
blades and a governor spring take over and regulate

<CLAIMS>
A ram air turbine comprising:

a hub (10;110) mounted for rotation about a
rotational axis (12;112) ;
at least one turbine blade (14;114)) rotatably
mounted on said hub for rotation about a blade pitch axis

(16;116) between coarse and fine pitch positions, said
blade pitch axis being different from said rotation axis;
a counterweight assembly (18,20,22;20) for each said
turbine blade and mounted on said hub for rotation between

coarse and fine pitch positions about said blade pitch
axis in spaced relation to said rotational axis and

disposed when rotated about said rotational axis to bias
said turbine blade toward said coarse pitch positions;

and
a main governor spring (30;130) biasing one of said
counterweight and said blade toward said fine pitch

position;

   characterised by

a lost motion connection between said turbine blade
and said counterweight assembly;

and
means (42;142) acting across said lost motion
connection and biasing said blade toward said coarse pitch

position.
A ram air turbine according to claim 1 wherein said
means acting across include a biasing spring.
A ram air turbine according to claim 2 wherein said
biasing spring is a torsion spring.
A ram air turbine according to claim 3 wherein
torsion spring includes a wrap and said wrap is about said

blade pitch axis.
A ram air turbine according to claim 4 wherein the
main governor spring (30;130) is mounted on the hub

(10;110) and coupled to the counterweight assembly for
biasing the counterweight assembly towards said fine 

position thereof; and the torsion spring wrapped about
said blade pitch axis has one end coupled to said

counterweight assembly and on opposite end coupled to said
turbine blade and is operative to bias said turbine blade

towards one limit movement of said lost motion connection
relative to said counterweight, said one limit of movement

corresponding to the coarse pitch position of said turbine
blade.
A ram air turbine according to any preceding claim
wherein said lost motion connection comprises a collar

(143) fixed to and rotatable with said turbine blade about
said blade pitch axis, and a pair of interengaging stop

surfaces (146,150,144,148) on each of said collar and said
counterweight assembly, the stop surfaces of the pair on

one of said collar and said counterweight being spaced a
greater distance than the stop surfaces of the pair on the

other of said collar and said counterweight.
The ram air turbine of claim 6 wherein said counter
weight assembly includes an opening centered on said blade

pitch axis with the stop surfaces of the associated pair
being circumferentially spaced about said opening, and

said collar is disposed in said opening and the stop
surfaces of the associated pair are spaced about the

periphery of said collar.
A ram air turbine according to any preceding claim
further including means for biasing t
he blade when rotated
towards its fine pitch position.
