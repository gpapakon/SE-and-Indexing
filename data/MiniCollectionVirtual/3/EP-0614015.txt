<ABSTRACT>
The transverse fan impeller (30) has at 
least two modules (32). Each module is defined by an 

adjacent pair of partition disks (34) each 
perpendicularly centered on the rotational axis of the 

impeller (30). Blades (31) extend longitudinally between 
pairs of partition disks (34). The angular spacing of 

blades (31) in a module (32) is nonuniform but also not 
random, being determined by application of certain 

formulae disclosed. The angular blade spacing within 
each module (32) of the impeller (30) is the same, but 

the modules (32) are angularly offset so that a blade 
(31) in one module (32) is offset from the corresponding 

blade (31) in an adjacent module (32) by a predetermined 
value. The module and blade configurations reduce both 

the blade rate tonal noise and overall radiated noise 
produced as compared to an impeller having uniformly 

spaced blades.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of air 
moving apparatus such as fans and blowers. More specifically, 
the invention relates to an impeller for use in 
fans of the transverse type. Transverse fans are also 
known as cross-flow or tangential fans. The operating characteristics and physical configuration 
of transverse fans make them particularly suitable 
for use in a variety of air moving applications. Their 
use is widespread in air conditioning and ventilation 
apparatus. Because such apparatus almost always operates 
in or near occupied areas, a significant design and manufacturing 
objective is quiet operation. FIG. 1 shows schematically the general arrangement 
and air flow path in a typical transverse fan installation. 
FIG. 2 shows the main features of a typical transverse 
fan impeller. Fan assembly 10 comprises enclosure 
11 in which is located impeller 30. Impeller 30 is 
generally cylindrical and has a plurality of blades 32 
disposed axially along its outer surface. As impeller 30 
rotates, it causes air to flow from enclosure inlet 21 
through inlet plenum 22, through impeller 30, through 
outlet plenum 23 and out via enclosure outlet 24. Rear 
or guide wall 15 and vortex wall 14 each form parts of 
both inlet and outlet plena 22 and 23. The general principles 
of operation of a transverse fan are well known 
and need not be elaborated upon except as necessary to an 
understanding of the present invention. When a transverse fan is operating, it generates a 
certain amount of noise. One significant component of 
the total noise output of the fan is a tone having a 
frequency related to the rotational speed of the fan 
multiplied by the number of fan blades (the blade rate 
tone). The passage of the blades past the vortex wall 
produces this blade rate tone. Discrete frequency noise  
 
is in general more irritating to a listener than broad 
band noise of the same intensity. The blade rate tone 
produced by the typical prior art transverse fan has 
limited the use of such fans in applications where quiet 
operation is required. At least one prior art disclosure has proposed a 
means of reducing the blade rate tonal noise produced by 
a transverse fan. U.S. Patent 4,538,963 (issued 3 September 
1985 to Sugio et al.) discloses a transverse fan 
impeller in which the circumferential blade spacing 
(called pitch angle in the patent) is random. Random 
blade spacing can be effective in reducing noise but can 
lead to problems in static and dynamic balance and to 
difficulties in
