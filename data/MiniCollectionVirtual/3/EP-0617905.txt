<ABSTRACT>
A stick-shaped piece drive container capable of preventing a 
stick-shaped piece from drying out by evaporating moisture is 

provided. A stick-shaped piece supplying cassette capable of 
supplying a stick-shaped piece to the stick-shaped piece drive 

container in a simple way is also provided. The stick-shaped 
piece drive container is comprised of an outer cylinder (1) and a 

screw shaft (5) having a helical groove (5B) provided on a circumference 
thereof and a connecting portion provided on a front end thereof, 

and being inserted in the outer cylinder (1) unrotatably but movable 
in an axial direction thereof. An inner cylinder (2) has a projection 

provided on a rear inside thereof that fits the helical groove (5B), 
and is immovably mounted in the outer cylinder (1) but is rotatable 

in an axial direction thereof to extend out of it forwardly. A 
stick-shaped piece holder (4) is detachably coupled with the 

connecting portion of the screw shaft (5) and slidably provided in 
the inner cylinder (2) for holding a stick-shaped piece. A cap (8) 

detachably fits the inner cylinder (2) or the outer cylinder (1) or both. 
Sealing means (9A) provided on a circumference of the stick-shaped 

piece holder (4) close by fitting the inside of the inner cylinder (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drive container
for extending or retracting a stick-shaped piece and a
storage supply cassette for a stick-shaped piece of material.
The drive container comprising an outer cylinder;
a screw shaft inserted in said outer cylinder, so as to be
axially movable but rotationally fixed with respect to
said outer cylinder, said screw shaft having a helical
groove; an inner cylinder mounted
on said outer cylinder so as to be rotationally movable
but axially fixed with respect to said outer cylinder, a
portion of said inner cylinder extending beyond a forward
end of said outer cylinder; projecting means on an inside
surface of said inner cylinder for engaging said helical
groove of said screw shaft; a holder
formed of a cylindrical elastomer resin
holding said stick-shaped
piece on said screw shaft for
axial sliding movement within said inner cylinder; cap
means detachable covering said inner cylinder; and annular
projecting sealing means integrally formed on an outside
circumference of said holder for sealing between the circumference
of said holder and the inside of said inner
cylinder. A drive container of this type is known from EP-A-182
655. A disadvantage of such a container is that the stick-shaped
piece cannot be replaced easily since before supplying
a new stick-shaped piece the remaining stick-shaped
piece must be removed from the holder.Another example of a conventional drive container for
extending or retracting a stick-shaped piece is shown in
Fig.7, which has the following construction.In the figure, outer cylinder 21 has stick-shaped piece
holder 24 provided therein which holds stick-shaped piece 23,
such as, for example, a correction rod, with internal screw-thread
24A. Stick-shaped piece holder 24 is mounted for axial
movement but is prevented from rotating by key 29 formed on an
inside of outer cylinder 21 and keyway 30 formed on a
circumference of stick-shaped piece holder 24.Stick-shaped piece holder 24 also has internal screw-thread
35 formed on a rear inside thereof. Stick-shaped piece holder 24
further has screw shaft 36 provided therein which has screw
groove 36A formed on a circumference thereof to engage internal
screw-thread 35. Screw shaft 36 has annular ridge 37, annular
ridge 38 on a large-diameter shaft and rear end knob 39 provided
around its root, which are axially immovable but are axially 
rotatable and coupled with the inside of a inward step 40, an annular
groove 41 in a large-diameter cylinder of the rear end formed on
the inside of outer
