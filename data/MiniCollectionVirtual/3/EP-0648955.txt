<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clutch disc for a motor-vehicle friction clutch comprising a hub (2) concentric with an axis of rotation and having a hub disc (3), a lining carrier (4) arranged on one side and having friction linings, a cover plate (6) which is arranged on the other side and is connected rigidly in terms of rotation to the lining carrier, helical springs (8) for the load range, which are arranged, on the one hand, in apertures (9) in the hub disc and, on the other hand, on the lining carrier and the cover plate and rest by one end on control edges (21) of the apertures of the lining carrier and the cover plate and by the other end, in contrast, on stop lugs (28) of load active friction discs (26, 27) which are arranged on both sides of the hub disc and of which at least one has webs (51) for receiving stop lugs on an annular main body (50). The aim is to construct a clutch disc of this kind with load active friction discs in such a way that even when the stop lug is in an unfavourable position relative to an associated control edge, the stresses which are produced by a torque introduced by the forces applied can be kept within limits. For this purpose, the stop lug is formed integrally both with the web and with a brace (56) aligned at an angle to the latter and is provided in the region of engagement of the spring with an increase (57) in cross-section which can be elastically deformed when force is introduced.

Clutch plate for a motor vehicle friction clutch comprising a hub 
and hub disc concentric with an axis of rotation, a lining carrier for 

the friction linings arranged on the one side, a cover pressing 
arranged on the other side and connected to the lining carrier to 

rotate with it, coil springs for the load range, arranged in windows 
in the hub disc on the one hand as well as in the lining carrier and 

cover pressing on the other hand and engaging with one end against 
control edges of the windows in the lining carrier and cover 

pressing and with their other ends on the other hand against stop 
lugs in load friction discs arranged on both sides of the hub disc, at 

least one of the load friction discs having a web for receiving the 
stop lugs on a ring-shaped base body, characterised in that,
 
each stop lug (28) is made integral both with the web (51) and also 

with the bracing (56) which is directed at an angle to it and has in 
the region of engagement by the spring (8) a region (52) which, as 

a consequence of its elastic deformability on the application of a 
force by the spring (8) is brought into engagement against a region 

(53) of the bracing (56) spaced away with respect to this region 
(52) in the circumferential direction of the ring-shaped base body 

(50), so that the spaced-away region (53) of the bracing (56) forms, 
on engagement of the elastically deformable region (52), a 

reinforcement cross-section (57) of the stop lug (28). 
Clutch plate according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
on each stop lug (28) the region (53) of the bracing (56) projects in 

a radial direction beyond the remainder of the bracing (56), 
whereby this region (53) is provided for the application of force.  

 
Clutch plate according to claim 1, characterised in that the stop 
lug (28) has as an elastically deformable region a first lug portion 

(52) connected to the web (51) and as a region of the bracing (56) a 
second lug portion (53) made integral with the latter and acting as a 

cross-section reinforcement (57) which is bent back with respect to 
the first lug portion (52) through an angle which lies between 90° 

and 180° . 
Clutch plate according to claim 1 and 3, characterised in that the 
angle between the two lug portions (52, 53) amounts to almost 

180°. 
Clutch plate according to claim 1, characterised in that the bracing 

(56) is formed on one load friction disc (27) and is used as an axial 
abutment (30) for the other load friction disc (26).
