<ABSTRACT>
The tray is characterized in that it is comprised of a reinforcement element (6) having a cross-section equivalent to the cross-section of the tray column (5), the reinforcement element (6) being encased there inside. It has also tongues (19) which are inserted between the column (5) and the reinforcement element (6). The process comprises the following steps: sizing or gluing of the external part of the columns (5); placing the side walls (3) in vertical position; placing a body in the columns (5); pressing the head walls (4) against the columns (5); placing the reinforcement elements (6) unfolded at the bottom of the tray (2); and folding of the tray conformed in its transport position. A tray is thus obtained which can be transported in a folded configuration and which can withstand considerable weights by placing the reinforcement elements.
