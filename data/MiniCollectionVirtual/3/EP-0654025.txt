<ABSTRACT>
A biocatalytic method of preparing optically pure precursors of paroxetine and a method of preparing paroxetine therefrom are disclosed. A racemic trans ester precursor compound of paroxetine is first prepared. The racemic trans ester precursor compound comprises a mixture of (3S, 4R) and (3R, 4S) enantiomers. The (3R, 4S) enantiomer is hydrolyzed biocatalytically to the corresponding (3R, 4S)-trans carboxylic acid or alternatively, the (3S, 4R) enantiomer is biocatalytically hydrolyzed to the (3S, 4R)-trans carboxylic acid in a reaction catalyzed by an isolated enzyme or a microorganism. In the first instance, the unhydrolyzed (3S, 4R) enantiomer is separated from the (3R, 4S)-trans carboxylic acid, whereas in the second instance the (3S, 4R)-trans carboxylic acid is separated from the unhydrolyzed (3R, 4S) enantiomer. The (3S, 4R) enantiomer obtained following the selective hydrolysis is reduced to form a (-)-trans-(3S, 4R) primary alcohol precursor of paroxetine. Paroxetine is then formed from the (-)-trans-(3S, 4R) primary alcohol precursor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF PREPARING OPTICALLY PURE PRECURSORS OFPAROXETINEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a biocatalytic method of preparing optically pure precursors of paroxetine, and more particularly, it relates to an improved method of resolving a first racemic precursor of paroxetine into a second, optically pure precursor of paroxetine. Additionally, the present invention relates to a method of preparing paroxetine, an optically pure compound, from a racemic precursor.Description the Background ArtU.S. Patent No. 4,007,196 and U.S. Patent No. 4,902,801, both incorporated by reference herein, disclose compounds of formula I:in which R1 represents hydrogen, trifluoro (CM) alkyl, alkyl or alkynyl, R2 represents an alkyl or alkynyl group having 1-4 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group.optionally substituted by CM alkyl, alkylthio, alkoxy, halogen, nitro, acylamino, methylsulfonyl or methylenedioxy groups. Alternately R2 may represent a tetrahydronaphthyl group. X represents hydrogen, an alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy, trifluoroalkyl, hydroxy, halogen, methylthio or aralkyloxy group.The compounds of formula I have pharmacological properties that make them useful as anti-depressants. One compound that has proved especially valuable is 

the serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitor paroxetine [R1=H, R2=(l,3-benzodioxyl-5-yl) , X=4-F] , the pharmacologically active form of which is the (-)- trans isomer. The (-)-trans isomer (i.e., the active form) of paroxetine exhibits the (3S,4R) absolute stereoconfiguration according to Plenge et al. fJ. Phar . Pharmacol. 1987, 3_9: 877-882].In U.S. Patent No. 4,902,801 and U.S. Patent No. 4,007,196, paroxetine is prepared from a (3S,4R)-trans precursor compound of formula (II) :in which R is CH3 or H. The piperidine carbinol compounds of formula (II) are in turn prepared by reduction of a racemic trans ester precursor compound of formula (III) :Rin which R is CH3 or H and R1 is CH3 or C2H5. The reduction is carried out conventionally using a metal hydride, for example lithium aluminum hydride or 

aluminum hydride, in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or in a tetrahydrofuran/ oluene mixture. Following reduction of the racemic trans ester precursor compound of formula (III) , the precursor compounds of formula (II) are obtained in the trans configuration but as a mixture of (3R,4S) and (3S,4R) enantiomers. The precursor compounds of formula (II) are then resolved into their respective enantiomeric forms by conventional
