<ABSTRACT>
Somatotropin solutions which remain clear for extended periods and which remain clear when subjected to mechanical agitation are prepared by mixing a lyophilized somatotropin composition containing about 1 part somatotropin per 2 to 8 parts arginine HC1 on a weight basis, wherein the pH of the composition prior to lyophilization was about 7.2 to about 8.5, and a biocompatible diluent which comprises EDTA and a nonionic surfactant. If the pH of the somatotropin composition prior to lyophilization was between 7.2 and 7.8, the diluent further comprises a buffer; otherwise the diluent optionally further can comprise a buffer or nonbuffering agent.

 1yoph1.1zed somatotropin formulationsBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe" present invention relates to novel solutions of somatotropins which remain clear for an extended period of time and which remain clear when subjected to mechanical agitation, and to kits for making the solutions.Somatotropins, also known as growth hormones, are polypeptide hormones secreted by the pituitary glands of many animal species. These hormones are valuable for a number of therapeutic uses, and compositions comprising somatotropin can be administered in the treatment of pituitary deficiency in humans and gastrointestinal bleeding or to promote the healing of bone fractures and accelerate the healing of contusions and other wounds. Somatotropins also are useful in promoting meat and milk production in animals when administered through various drug-releasing devices or by injection. (See E.J. Tur an, "Some Effects of Pituitary Anterior Growth Factor" Thesis: PurdueUniversity, April, 1953; L.J. Machlin, J. Ani . Sci. 35: 794-800 (1972); T.R. Kasser et al., J. Anim. Sci. 53: 420-426; L.J. Machlin, J. Dairy Sci. 56: 575-580 (1973)). It frequently is desirable to work with and administer proteins such as somatotropins in the form of a solution. However, dissolved proteins, such as 

somatotropin, can be adsorbed at hydrophobic interfaces, thus causing secondary reactions. For example, "denaturing", i.e. a change in the shape of the adsorbed somatotropin molecules can occur. In addition, aggregation of adsorbed somatotropin molecules can take place to give soluble or insoluble polymeric forms. This aggregation will manifest itself, for example, as turbidity of the solution or as biological inactivation of the somatotropin protein on stirring or shaking of the aqueous solutions (See A.F. Henson et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci. 32: 162 (1970)).When the somatotropin precipitates from solution, the precipitated protein becomes unavailable for administration. Thus, a somatotropin solution is needed which will not become turbid upon stirring or shaking and which will remain clear over extended periods of storage.Summary of the InventionIn accordance with the present invention, there are disclosed somatotropin solutions which remain clear for extended periods and which do not become cloudy or precipitate when subjected to mechanical agitation. The somatotropin solutions contain a lyophilized somatotropin composition containing about 1 part somatotropin per 2 to 8 parts arginine HCl on a weight basis, the pH of the composition prior to
