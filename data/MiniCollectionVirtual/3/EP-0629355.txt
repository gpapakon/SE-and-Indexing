Process for the treatment of waste material in
the form of filter rods, filter-tipped cigarettes and the

like which contain filter material having inner cavities
accessible from the outside and having at least one other

material component, in particular paper and tobacco, the
following process steps being carried out:


a) a gas that is inert with respect to the filter
material is dissolved in a liquid that is largely inert

with respect to the filter material and is contained in
a pressure vessel, the waste material already being

present in the inert liquid or being fed to it after the
inert gas has been dissolved,
b) the waste material/liquid mixture is stirred until the
filter material has been detached from the other material

components,
c) the inert gas dissolved in the liquid is then
released, at least partly, in the form of fine gas

bubbles by the pressure being lowered and/or the temperature
being raised, and
d) the fine gas bubbles produced on the surface of the
other material components to be separated off are removed

or the formation of the fine gas bubbles is prevented by
a selectively acting wetting agent being added in the

course of the process, prior to measure c) being carried
out, this wetting agent raising the wettability of the

surface of the other material components to such an
extent that no fine gas bubbles are produced on the

surface of these components while measure c) is carried
out,
 
in which the above measures lead to the situation where

the filter material in the inert liquid rises, because of
the gas bubbles enclosed in its inner cavities, and the

other material components to be separated off sink,
because of their different buoyancy behaviour, which

leads to the separation of filter material and the other
material components.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in measure a), the gas is dissolved in the inert

liquid by the pressure being increased.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that, in measure a), the inert gas is dissolved in the

inert liquid by the temperature being lowered.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the inert liquid is partly

saturated, saturated or over-saturated with the inert
gas.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that water is used as inert liquid.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that air and/or carbon dioxide is/are

used as inert gas.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the filter material is based on

cellulose acetate or polypropylene.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that, in measure d), the free gas

bubbles are knocked off mechanically, in particular by
stirring.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the wettability of the other

material components to be separated off from the filter
material is raised by wetting agents being added in

measure d), with the result that the free gas bubbles
formed on the surface of the other material components

are thereby removed.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that, in measure b), the inert liquid is

heated to at least 80Â°C in order to facilitate, in 
particular, the separation of the individual components

of the waste material.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that, in the case of water as inert

liquid, the pressure difference between measures a) and
c) is set at 10 bar.
