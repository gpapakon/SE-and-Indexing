<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for exposing a printed circuit to light through two negatives. The upper negative is movable in a vertical direction. The lower negative (68) is movable horizontally along two directions by virtue of motors (90, 92, 94). The printed circuit (72) which rests on the lower negative can be moved by virtue of two fingers (96, 98) which penetrate into two orifices (104, 106). The fingers can be moved independently with respect to the lower frame (64) in order to achieve positioning of the circuit (72) with respect to the lower negative (68). Movable cameras (76, 78) make it possible to detect positioning errors.

Apparatus for exposure to light of a double-sided
printed circuit board through negatives, comprising:


a first support (12) for a negative (54) provided
with a position registration mark;
a second support (14) for a negative (68) provided
with a position registration mark;
a light source (26);
optical means (28, 34, 36) for simultaneously
directing a light beam towards each negative support

from the beam emitted by the said source; and
means for arranging the said circuit (72) between
the said first and second negative supports, the

said circuit being provided with a position
registration mark;
optical means (74, 76) for detecting errors in
positioning between the said circuit and the said

second support and between the said first support
and the said second support or between the said

circuit and the said first support by means of the
registration marks;
characterised by
 the fact that it also comprises:

means (90, 92, 94) arranged externally of the
assembly formed by the said supports and the said

circuit and on the side of the said second support
to displace the said second support in its plane

relative to the said first support as a function of
the detected positioning error; and
means (96, 98, 100, 102) arranged externally of the
assembly formed by the said supports and the said 

circuit and on the side of the said second support
to displace the said circuit in its plane relative

to the second support as a function of the detected
positioning error, the said means comprising a first

(96) and a second (98) displacement finger which can
be displaced in two directions at right-angles

parallel with the said circuit, the said circuit
including two orifices (104, 106), the end of each

of the fingers being able to enter one of the said
orifices; and
means (56, 58) for displacing the said first support
perpendicularly to its plane towards the said second

support and the said circuit.
Apparatus for exposure to light as described in
claim 1, 
characterised by
 the fact that the registration
marks on each negative (54, 68) comprise two target marks

(130, 134, 144, 146, 152, 156), by the fact that the
registration marks of the circuit (72) comprise two

orifices and by the fact that the optical detection means
comprise two cameras (74, 76) displaceable in a plane

parallel with the said circuit in two directions at
right-angles.
Apparatus for exposure to light as described in any
one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised by
 the fact that the
optical detection means (74, 76) detect positioning

errors between the second negative (68) and the said
circuit (72) and positioning errors between the said

circuit (72) and the first negative (54).
Apparatus for exposure to light as described in any
one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised by
 the fact that the
optical detection means (74, 76) detect positioning

errors between the second negative (68) and the said 
circuit (72) and positioning errors between the said

second negative (68) and the said first negative (54).
Apparatus for exposure to light as described in any
one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by
 the fact that each
negative support comprises a frame (50, 64) and a glazing

(52, 66) rigidly attached (12, 14) to the said frame,
each glazing receiving one of the said negatives (54,

68).
Apparatus for exposure to light as described in any
one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by
 the fact that the
said first negative support (12) is arranged above the

said second negative support (14).
