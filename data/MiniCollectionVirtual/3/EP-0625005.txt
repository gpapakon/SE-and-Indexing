<DESCRIPTION>
 Polyphenol OxidasePolyphenol oxidases (PPO) are ubiquitous copper metalloenzymes of angiosperms which catalyze the oxidation of phenols to quinones at the expense of O2. More specifically these enzymes catalyze the 0- hydroxylation of a monophenol followed by its oxidation to the 0- diquinone (cresolase activity [E.C. 1.14.18.1]), or the oxidation of an 0- dihydroxyphenol to the o-diquinone (catecholase activity [E.C. 1.10.3.2]). Although PPOs may possess both catecholase and cresolase activities, typically the cresolase activity is absent, labile, or requires priming with reducing agent or small amounts of an o-dihydroxyphenol. The quinonoid reaction products formed by PPO are highly reactive, electrophilic molecules which undergo secondary reactions with themselves or act to covalently modify and crosslink a variety of cellular nucleophiles, including nucleophiles of proteins such as sulfhydryl, amine, amide, indole and imidazole substituents. The formation of quinone adducts (usually brown or black colored) represents the primary detrimental effect of PPO in post harvest physiology and food processing and is the primary reason for the interest in PPOs in food technology. [See Adv. Food Res 19:75 (1971 )]. In the cultivated potato alone, melanization driven by PPO is responsible for significant losses each year in potato processing (prepeel blackening, blackspot, pressure bruising and blackheart). Sulfite or ascorbate additives used in the food, wine and beverage industry are frequently employed to inhibit activity of PPO. Conversely, the ability of quinones to covalently modify and reduce the nutritive value of plant proteins has generated interest in PPO for increasing the herbivore resistance of plants [see Naturally Occurring Pest Bioregulators, pp 166-197, ACE Books, Washington (1991)]. Despite the intense study of PPO since its first description in1895, a large number of biochemical and physiological studies have provided few answers to the question of PPO function and expression. The primary obstacle to understanding PPO function is the formation of artifactual protein species and enzyme inactivation due to quinone 

adduct formation and PPO crosslinking during isolation and purification. Thus, rapid quinone formation makes it exceptionally difficult to isolate an unmodified PPO, and this problem is a significant factor contributing to the high and varying estimates of the number and properties of higher plant PPOs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining PPO-null plants has thus far
