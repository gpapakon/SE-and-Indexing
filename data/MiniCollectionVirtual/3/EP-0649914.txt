<ABSTRACT>
An Fe-Mn vibration damping alloy steel having a mixture structure of ε, 
α' and γ. The alloy steel consists of iron, manganese from 10 to 24 % by weight and 

limited amounts of impurities. The alloy steel is manufactured by preparing an ingot 
at a temperature of 1000°C to 1300°C for 12 to 40 hours to homogenize the ingot 

and hot-rolling the homogenized ingot to produce a rolled alloy bar or plate, 
performing solid solution treatment on the alloy steel at 900°C to 1100°C for 30 to 

60 minutes, cooling the alloy steel by air or water, and cold-rolling the alloy steel at 
a reduction rate of below 30 % at around room temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method for making an Fe-Mn vibration
damping alloy steel at a low production cost.In line with a trend for high-grade and high precision
aircraft, ships, automotive vehicles and various machinery,
vibration damping alloy is widely used in the many kinds of
machine parts that are sources of vibration and noise.
Study of vibration damping alloys has been lively because
of the increase in demand for such alloys.Vibration damping alloys developed and used so far are
classified into following types: Fe-C-Si and Al-Zn which
are of the composite type; Fe-Cr, Fe-Cr-Al and Co-Ni which
are of the ferromagnetic type; Mg-Zr, Mg and Mg2Ni which are
of the dislocation type;- and Mn-Cu, Cu-Al-Ni and Ni-Ti
which are of the twin type. The above vibration damping
alloys have excellent vibration damping capacities but have
poor mechanical properties. Thus, the alloys cannot be
used widely; and since they contain a lot of expensive
elements, the production costs are high, limiting the
industrial use of the alloys.A solution of the above problem is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,290,372 (Jong-Sool Choi, et al.) and in an article of Metallurgical
Transactions A, Vol. 18A, June 1987, titled 'The relationship between
toughness and microstructure in Fe high Mn binary alloys', by Tomota, Strum and Morris.
These two disclosures describe
Fe-Mn (10 to 22%) and (16-36% respectively) vibration damping
alloy steels having a partial martensitic structure. As a
method for making the alloy, an Fe-Mn (10-22%) ingot is
homogenized at 1000°C to 1300°C for 20 to 40 hours and hot-rolled. 
After solid solution treatment of the ingot at 900
to 1100°C for 30 minutes to an hour, air cooling or water
quenching is carried out to produce a partial epsilon
martensite from the parent phase, austenite. This damping
mechanism is entirely different from those of the
conventional damping alloys, and has a characteristic of
absorbing vibrational energy by movement of the ε/γ
interface under external vibration stress. However, we
have made an effort to further improve excellent vibration
damping alloy steels and we succeeded in inventing a
vibration damping alloy steel of the present invention.The method of the present invention is given in the single claim.FIG. 1 is a binary phase diagram of an Fe-Mn alloy; FIG. 2 shows a transformation amount of the Fe-Mn
alloy at room temperature; FIG. 3 shows specific damping capacities according to
the amount of cold rolling of the Fe-17%Mn alloy; andFIGS. 4A to 4D show free vibration
