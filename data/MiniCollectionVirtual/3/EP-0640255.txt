<ABSTRACT>
A primary inductive track or path (450) for a resonant inductive power distribution system is made up from a number of modules (453), each supplied as a pre-built and substantially pre-tuned segment of the track. These modules have more than one capacitor (456, 457) and more than one inductance (458, 459) (generally, the inductance is the intrinsic inductance of the length of track) and each capacitor and adjacent inductor is capable of resonating at its own native frequency. A zero-inductance cable (452) carries a small fraction of the circulating resonant current (comprising a mismatch or an error current), directly connects the capacitors at poles having equal polarity and tends to constrain the system limiting possible frequencies of resonance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power distribution systems, particularly those using inductive
power transfer from high frequency resonant currents within the primary conductors, and
more particularly to modular resonant magnetic field emitter units.Long-standing problems exist in the conventional transfer of electric power to self-powered
moving vehicles. Those having a sliding brush rubbing along a fixed current-carrying
conductive rail exhibit wear, dust production, intermittent loss of electrical contact, sparking,
and electric shock hazards. Vehicles lacking the guidance of weight-bearing rails are
particularly prone to wander away from a defined route and are then likely to lose electrical
contact with a supply conductor.Inductive power distribution systems overcome many of the problems by using the
alternating magnetic field surrounding a fixed primary conductor to induce current in a
secondary conductor at some distance from the primary conductor, thereby avoiding direct
contact. They are particularly suited to providing motive power.The use of high-frequency resonating currents within primary and secondary conductors has
greatly improved the efficiency of inductive power distribution, and recent developments in
semiconductor technology have permitted the application of improved inductive power
systems as have been described by Boys & Green in WO 92/17929)EP A 0 289 868 describes an electrical modular roadway system adapted for transmitting
power to and controlling inductively coupled vehicles travelling thereon. The system
comprises a plurality of elongated, electrically connected inductor modules arranged in an
aligned end-to-end and spaced apart in order to form a continuous vehicle path. Each module
has a magnetic core and power windings which generate a magnetic field extending above
the road surface. Controllable relays are connected between modules for allowing operating
electric current either to activate or bypass selected modules. Sensing windings in modules
are activated by the presence of a vehicle on one module to provide control signals to relays
for other modules. A paper entitled "Contactless Power Delivery System for Mining Applications" by K Klontz
et al (Conference Record of the 1991 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting,
Volume 1, 28 September 1991, USA, pages 1263-1269) describes a primary inductive
pathway for a resonant inductive power distribution system, the pathway comprising several
primary conductor modules. Resonant inductive power transfer systems been
