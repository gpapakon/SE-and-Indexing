<ABSTRACT>
Slot or track milling tool device wherein a number of inserts having an insignificant axial extension are arranged in seats at the peripheral portion of an essentially disc shaped tool holder body, the inserts (7) being of a per se known kind, having at least one relatively to the insertion direction of the insert obliquely arranged abutment face (17) which will be in contact with an abutment portion (16) at each seat of the tool holder body (2), each such abutment portion being a tongue shaped portion (15) integral with the tool holder body and wherein between each of the essentially tongue shaped portions (15) and the remainder of the tool holder body (2) there is arranged a rotatable clamping device (20) having surfaces (24) arranged in a cam or eccentric fashion and intended to without displacement of said disc displace the tongue shaped portions (15) so that an abutment point (16) thereon reaches an engagement with and remains engaging the obliquely rearwardly facing engagement surface (17) of the insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates especially to milling tools 
according to the precharacterising portion of claim 1 for slot 
milling operations, i.e. rotating tools for milling slots 
in work pieces; see CH-A 120 050. Many different types of rotating milling tools for slots 
are known and as an example of the state of art may be 
mentioned such a tool including an essentially disc shaped 
body, at its periphery having a number of recesses or cuts 
in which inserts are arranged. The cuts are arranged in 
such a way relatively to the inserts, e.g. with essentially 
radially localized complementary abutments portions, that 
the positioning necessary in axial and circumferential 
direction, i.e. the direction of working, is achieved. 
In radial direction, the tools are secured, besides by the 
influence of the cutting forces, by friction and clamping 
action excerted by material portions adjoining the cuts only. 
This clamping force is dependent on the tolerances between 
the cut and the insert and could to a certain extent also be 
influenced negatively by material fatigue in the adjoining 
material portions. This implies that the ability of the disc shaped body to 
retain the inserts is dependent on the rotational speed of 
the milling tool, i.e. the centrifugal force, and this is 
the background of the one of the most prominent drawbacks of 
known slot milling tools, namely that the ability to retain 
the inserts decreases or ceases when the speed is allowed to 
go beyond the intended one and also when the material of the  
 
disc shaped body starts to be fatigued. There are known cases 
where milling discs have been rotated with too high a speed 
and the inserts like bullets from an automatic weapon have 
been thrown from the retaining disc causing great hazard for 
persons nearby. It is obvious that such tools even if they 
have a notation concerning speed limit recommended by the 
manufacturer are to be regarded as dangerous tools. One aspect of the invention is to bring about a device 
eliminating the above mentioned risks for inserts e.g. 
at too high a rotational speed will leave the tool holder 
disc. Another aspect is to bring about a device allowing safe 
and stable fixation of inserts also at very thin discs. Another aspect is to bring about a device where the 
dependency of remaining resiliency characteristics of 
the material to the largest possible extent is eliminated 
and where the locking of the inserts is based on relations 
between configurations. Still another aspect is to make it possible to

<CLAIMS>
Rotating milling tool device, especially a slot 
or track milling tool, wherein a number of inserts, (7) each 

having an insignificant axial extension, are arranged at 
the peripheral portion of an essentially disc shaped tool 

holder body (2), each one of the inserts (7) being received 
in a seat having guiding means for the positioning of the 

insert, wherein each such insert (7) 
has at least one 

abutment face (17) which is 
to be engaged by an abutment portion (16) adjacent each 

respective seat of the tool holder body (2), each such 
abutment portion being an essentially tongue shaped 

portion (15) integral with the tool holder body and 
defined by cuts or the like (11,13) for allowing 

predetermined movability relatively to the tool holder 
body, the abutment portion holding and supporting an 

insert inserted into such a seat and wherein, between each 
of the tongue shaped portions (15) and the remainder of 

the tool holder body (2), is arranged a clamping device 
(20) including a rotatably arranged piece inside an 

opening and having a thickness essentially corresponding  
 

to that of the tool holder body, 
characterized
 
in that said rotatably arranged clamping device (20) 

further includes at least one surface (24) to function as 
a cam or eccentric, which surface on turning of the 

clamping device is arranged to, without peripheral or 
radial displacement of the clamping device relatively to 

the tool holder body, displace the tongue shaped portion 
(15) peripherally so that the abutment portion (16) 

thereof increasingly powerful engages the relatively to the 
direction of insertion obliquely arranged 

abutment face (17) of the insert thereby securing the 
insert (7) also due to mutual cooperation of 

configurations at the insert and the tool holder body, and 
in that at each of the tongue shaped portions (15), the 

nose (16) intended to engage the insert is localized 
adjacent the free end of said tongue shaped portions 

whereas the portion (25) thereof intended to be biassed by 
the clamping device, being at the opposite edge thereof, 

is closer to the connection between the tongue shaped 
portion and the remainder of the holder body. 
Device according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the cam or curve 
surfaces (24) of the clamping devices (20) have such a 

rise that a self locking effect is achieved in reached set 
position. 
Device according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that each rotatably 
arranged clamping device includes a circular plate having  

 
a centrally arranged through tool engaging hole and a 

peripherally arranged slot (22) defined by two tool holder 
body opening (19) engaging edges (23), the bottom (24) of 

the slot (22) forming an excentric curve or cam; and in 
that the one part of the opening (19) bridging a cut 

separating a tongue shaped portion (15) and the remainder 
of the tool holder body (2) presents a projection (25) 

extending essentially longitudinally of the said tongue 
shaped portion and adapted to be straddled by the plate 

edges (23) and engaged by the slot bottom (24) 
therebetween for acting as an excenter means biassing the 

tongue shaped portion (15) in turn engaging an insert (7).
