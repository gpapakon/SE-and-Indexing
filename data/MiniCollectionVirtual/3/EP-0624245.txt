<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to medical
diagnostic tests, and more specifically to metabolic breath
tests utilizing isotope ratios.Certain diagnostic medical tests rely on
administering an isotopically labelled compound to a patient
and then monitoring the patient's breath for metabolic products
of the labelled compound. Traditional metabolic breath tests
rely on administering a 14C-labelled substrate to a patient and
then measuring the concentration of 14CO2 exhaled on the
breath. Since 14C is radioactive, it is easily detected with
inexpensive radiation monitoring equipment. Unfortunately,
this radioactivity is also a problem because of its health risk
to the patient. One approach has been to replace the 14C
isotope with a non-radioactive one, such as 13C. Although this
eliminates the risks associated with exposure to 14C, it
creates a new problem; how to detect 13CO2 on the breath. This
problem is further compounded by the fact that the relative
natural abundance of 13C is approximately 1%, and considerable
variability in this value is known to exist. Although a number
of traditional approaches exist for monitoring 13C, including
isotope-ratio mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometry, the associated instrumentation is exceedingly
expensive and therefore limits the widespread use of 13C
labelled compounds in diagnostic tests.Lee and Majkowski (U.S. Patent 4,684,805) consider
the use of cryogenically cooled tunable infrared lead-salt
laser diodes for this as well as other medical tests by
monitoring certain molecular species on human breath. Since
the strongest absorption lines of interest were in the 4-µm to
5-µm range, lead-salt laser diodes, which emit in the 3-µm to 
30-µm region were a natural; choice. However, lead-salt laser diodes and their
associated detectors operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Furthermore, their
output is generally multimode and is typically less than a milliwatt.Reference is also made to US-A-4937448 which describes self-normalisation
of a laser spectrometer by I"/I laser modulation and detection. A single tunable
diode laser is frequency modulated by a high S/N ratio triangle wave, mechanically
chopped, passed through an isothermal in-line gas and reference chamber absorption
cell, and synchronously detected to provide the I" and I signals. The described
embodiment performs isotopic ratio measurements using a cryogenically cooled lead-salt
tunable diode laser, operating in the 3-30µm range. The disclosed system is said
to be suitable
