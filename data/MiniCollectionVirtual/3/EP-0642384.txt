<ABSTRACT>
A method for treating a contact body which comprises a moisture and/or heat exchange mass in a manner to obtain a silica gel whose structure is appropriate for such an exchange. The body is impregnated with waterglass in a first method step and then treated with acid to produce a gel. The gel is subjected in a second method step to a maturing process in which the gel is caused to mature in an environment with an elevated pH, so as to produce a sorbent silica gel of desired pore structure. The desired pore structure thus obtained is stabilized in a third step with the addition of chemicals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of treating a 
contact body intended for the exchange of heat, moisture 
or the like. Contact bodies are used in different applications for 
the exchange of moisture and/or heat, and are normally 
produced from sheets of paper which are preferably 
comprised of inorganic material and formed into blocks 
from which solid contact bodies are produced, or wound 
to form a rotor for use in rotary exchangers or contact 
bodies. Such bodies contain a moisture and/or heat-exchanging 
mass of alternating flat and corrugated layers which are 
so arranged that the corrugations form a large number of 
fine passages which extend generally parallel with one 
another. The flat and the corrugated layers are mutually 
combined and bonded to one another, normally by gluing 
the layers, whereafter, when a rotor is to be produced, 
the structure comprised of one flat layer and one corrugated 
layer is wound to form a generally cylindrical 
rotor in which the passages extend parallel with the 
rotor axis. When producing solid contact bodies, a 
number of such structures are stacked one upon the other 
to form a block. The turns of the rotor or the structural 
units forming said block are mutually bonded together 
in the same way as the flat and the corrugated sheets, 
for instance by gluing. It is known in the manufacture of such contact bodies 
for heat or moisture exchange purposes to impregnate the 
paper sheets of said bodies with a waterglass solution. 
The applied waterglass solution is then treated in  
 
different ways, e.g. dried by heating or by dipping the 
contact bodies in a spirit bath (see SE Patent No. 
305,170) and then treated with acid, salt or the like 
to form a silica gel. When producing a gel with the intention of manufacturing 
a structure that is suitable for moisture exchange 
purposes, it is essential to obtain a desired mean pore 
size and pore size distribution in a controlled fashion. 
When the exchange element is used to de-moisturize air 
and thus adsorbs moisture from the air, the moisture 
content of the air will change as the air passes over an 
effective adsorption surface, and consequently, in order 
to be effective, the adsorbent must be effective over a 
region of the moisture isotherm. When the exchange 
element is also to be effective over a larger climatic 
area, the gel must be given corresponding properties. 
This means that an effective gel is dependent on the 
availability of a controlled pore size distribution. The pore distribution of
