<ABSTRACT>
A leakage-detecting hose for the transportation of a 
fluid comprises a hose body (1 - 5) and an outermost 

rubber layer (8) through a buoyancy member (6), in which 
a secondary reinforcing layer (7) is arranged so as to 

divide the buoyancy member into two layers (6a, 6b) and 
comprised of at least two cord plies, the cords (7a, 7b) 

of which plies have a cord angle (ϑ) larger than the 
angle of repose with respect to a longitudinal direction 

of the hose and are crossed with each other in an axial 
direction of the hose.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a leakage-detecting
hose for fluid transportation, and more particularly to
a structure of a hose capable of exactly detecting
leakage of transporting fluid under a simple structure
without causing leakage from the inside of the hose
toward the outside thereof.In petroleum shipping and discharging,
petroleum is transported from a tanker floating on the
sea to a petroleum tank disposed on the land through a
hose connecting them to each other. However, if any
problem arises during the transportation,
there may be caused an accident wherein the hose is
cracked to allow petroleum to flow from the inside of the
hose into the sea. In this case, the ecosystem is broken down
in the vicinity of the petroleum floating area on the sea to
bring about a serious influence on fish, sea birds and
the like.To this end, it is attempted to take various
countermeasures for preventing the leakage of fluid such
as petroleum from the hose or further visually detecting
an abnormal state of the hose from the exterior in order to prevent a
significant accident from occurring.As a countermeasure for preventing the leakage 
of the fluid, there known is a method of arranging a secondary
reinforcing layer on an outer periphery of a hose body
to prevent the diffusion of fluid leaked from
cracked portions of the hose toward the outside of the
hose. As countermeasures for detecting the leakage
of the fluid from the hose body, there are known a first
method in which the secondary reinforcing layer is
previously disposed at a slackened state in an axial
direction of the hose body and then
expansion of the secondary reinforcing layer in the
peripheral direction thereof by stretching the slackened
state through pressure of the fluid leaked from the
hose body is visually detected from the exterior, and a
second method in which a mechanical type or electrical
type fluid detecting mechanism is arranged in the
vicinity of an end of a hose and detects fluid leaked
from the hose body and guided to the end of the hose
while retained inside the secondary reinforcing layer.A hose having a structure as shown in Fig. 5a of the accompanying drawings is
used in the first detecting method. That is, such a
hose comprises a hose body comprised of an inner rubber
layer 1, a primary reinforcing layer 2 of at least two
cord plies, reinforcing wires 3 embedded in rubber 4,
an outer rubber layer 5, and a secondary reinforcing
layer 10 disposed on an outer periphery of the hose body
wherein an inner surface of the layer 10 facing
