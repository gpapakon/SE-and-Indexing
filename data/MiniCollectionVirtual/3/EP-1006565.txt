<ABSTRACT>
A conveying device in which a conveying arm assembly can be
quickly set in a conveying position and can be rapidly stabilized in the

conveying position is disclosed. The conveying device comprises a
conveying arm assembly, a fixed shaft, at least one set of hollow operating

shafts which are necessary for controlling an operation of the conveying
arm assembly, and a motor provided between the fixed shaft and each of

the operating shafts. The one set of operating shafts are attached to the
fixed shaft such that they can be rotated coaxially with respect to the fixed

shaft outside fixed shaft and are arranged in an axial direction of the fixed
shaft. The motor comprises a stator provided on the fixed shaft and a

rotor provided on each of the operating shafts such that it is opposed to the
stator on an outer peripheral side of the stator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conveying device for conveying a
work piece such as a silicon wafer, for example.For etching of a wafer, CVD(chemical vapor deposition) and the like,
for example, it is necessary to convey the wafer in a multi-chamber in a
clean and ultra-high vacuum environment. In such an environment, the
conveying device operates. A conveying device which does not require the
use of a magnetic fluid seal, that is, a conveying device provided with a
separating wall between a rotor and a stator in a motor has been devised in
order to prevent the environment in the chamber from being deteriorated.
The conveying devices described in Japanese Patent No. 2,761,438 and
USP 5,720,590 are examples of such conveying devices. Fig.9 is a
longitudinal sectional view showing a conveying device 101 having the
same basic structure as the conveying devices described in the above-mentioned
publications. The conveying device 101 comprises a coaxial
shaft mechanism including a first shaft 121 and a second shaft 122 which
are independently rotatable, and a conveying arm assembly 130 fixed to
the upper ends of the shafts 121 and 122. The first shaft 121 extends
downward from the lower end of the second shaft 122 and penetrates the
second shaft 122. A rotor R' is attached to the outer peripheral sides of the
first shaft 121 and the second shaft 122, and a stator S' is attached to a
housing 190 accommodating the first shaft 121 and the second shaft 122.
A motor M' is constituted by the rotor R' and the stator S'. By controlling
the rotation of the motor M', the expansion, contraction and turn of the
conveying arm assembly 130 can be controlled. The reference numeral 
145 denotes an optical encoder for detecting the rotation of the first and
second shafts 121 and 122.In the conveying device 101 having such a structure, it is required
that the conveying arm assembly 130 should be quickly set in a conveying
position and be rapidly stabilized in the conveying position. For this
purpose, adequate characteristics are required for the shafts 121 and 122.
Fig. 10 is a chart showing a process of controlling the rotation of the shaft,
wherein an axis of ordinate indicates angular velocity of the shaft and an
axis of abscissa indicates time. In general, the rotation of the shaft is
controlled to reach a stopping step "e" from a stopping step "a" through an
accelerating step "b", a constant-velocity rotating step "c" and a
decelerating step "d" as shown in Fig. 10. In the conveying device 101, it
is necessary to
