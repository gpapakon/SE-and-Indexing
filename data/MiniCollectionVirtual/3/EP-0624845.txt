<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are provided for maintaining memory coherency. 
A memory device (16) stores information. A non-cached (18) is 

coupled to the 
memory device. The non-cached device inputs at least a portion of the 

information and outputs an indication that the portion is not to be 
cached by the non-cached device. At least one cached device (12,14) 

coupled to said memory device is responsive to said indication.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application relates in general to systems for 
processing information and in particular to a method and system for 
maintaining memory coherency. A system for processing information can include a system memory. 
Moreover, one or more devices of the system can include a cache memory. 
A cache memory is a relatively small high-speed memory that stores a copy 
of information from one or more portions of the system memory. 
Frequently, the cache memory is physically distinct from the system 
memory. Each device manages the state of its respective cache memory. A device can copy information from a portion of the system memory 
into the device's cache memory. The device can modify information in its 
cache memory. Further, the device can copy modified information from its 
cache memory back to a portion of the system memory. In a coherent memory system, all devices operate in response to the 
most recent version of information for the system memory. Such coherency 
allows synchronization, cooperative use of shared resources, and task 
migration among the devices. For maintaining memory coherency, the 
devices communicate status indications to one another through a system 
bus. Such status indications add traffic through the system bus. The 
added traffic is significant where a first device frequently modifies 
information for the system memory while a second device frequently 
attempts to input the information. By adding traffic through the system 
bus, overall performance of the system is degraded. Thus, a need has arisen for a method and system for maintaining 
memory coherency, in which traffic through the system bus is diminished 
relative to previous techniques. Also, a need has arisen for a method 
and system for maintaining memory coherency, in which overall performance 
of the system is improved. According to the invention there is provided an information 
processing system comprising: a memory device (16) for storing 
information; one or more cached devices (12, 14) coupled to the memory 
device (14), the or each cached device including a cache memory (24, 26);  
 
characterised by a non-cached device (18) coupled to the memory device 
and arranged to provide, when accessing information stored in the memory 
device (16), a signal to the, or each, cached device indicating that such 
information is not to be cached by the non-cached device, the or each 
cached device (12, 14) being responsive to said signal when a copy of the 
information being accessed is present in its respective cache
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An information processing system comprising: 
   a memory device (16) for storing information; 

   one or more cached devices (12, 14) coupled to the memory device 
(14), the or each cached device including a cache memory (24, 26); 

   characterised by 
   a non-cached device (18) coupled to the memory device and arranged 

to provide, when accessing information stored in the memory device (16), 
a signal to the, or each, cached device indicating that such information 

is not to be cached by the non-cached device, the or each cached device 
(12, 14) being responsive to said signal when a copy of the information 

being accessed is present in its respective cache memory to cause the 
copy to be stored or remain stored in the cache memory in a state 

indicating that the copy is consistent with the corresponding information 
in the memory device. 
An information processing system as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the or each cached device (12,14) is responsive to said signal, when a 

copy of the information being accessed is present in its respective cache 
memory and has been modified by the cached device since last being 

accessed in the memory device (16), to transfer a copy of the information 
to the memory device (16). 
A system as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 and further comprising a 
system bus for transferring information between said devices. 
A system as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said non cached device 
acces the memory devices through said system bus and provides said signal 

through said system bus. 
A system for maintaining memory coherency, comprising: 
   a system bus for transferring information between devices;

 
   a memory device coupled to said system bus for storing said 

information; 
   a graphics controller coupled to said system bus for inputting at 

least a portion of said information through said system bus and 
outputting an indication through said system bus that said portion is not 

to be cached by said graphics controller; and 
   a processor coupled to said system bus and including a cache memory 

for caching said portion in an exclusive state, said processor continuing 
to cache said portion in said exclusive state in response to said 

graphics controller outputting said indication and inputting said 
portion. 
The system of Claim 5 wherein said exclusive state is an exclusive 
modified state. 
The system of Claim 5 wherein said exclusive state is an exclusive 
unmodified state. 
The system of Claim 5 wherein said cache memory is integral with 
said processor. 
A method, comprising the steps of: 
   storing information at a first device; 

   outputting an indication that at least a portion of said 
information is not to be cached by a second device; and 

   using said second device, inputting said portion. 
The method of Claim 9 and further comprising the step of caching 
said portion at a third device.
