in such a manner that many amorphous metallic fibers are 

arranged in parallel, twisted primarily to be formed into a 
yarn (3) and that the necessary number of yarns (3) are twisted, 

wherein the cord satisfies the following formula:


aD² + b² + cD + d + eD + f ≧ 0.900 



 
   in which D is a diameter of the cord in millimeters, 

 is a diameter of the amorphous metallic wire in micrometers, 
a is -0.680, b is -3.13 × 10⁻⁵, c is 0.773, d is 2.78 × 

10⁻³, e is 2.42 × 10⁻³, and f is 0.618.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tension member embedded in 
many kinds of belts such as a synchronous belt, a V-belt, a 
flat belt and a variable speed belt. Since many kinds of belts such as a synchronous belt, a 
V-belt, a flat belt and a various speed belt require as its 
characteristics high strength, high elasticity and high dimensional 
stability, a tension member such as fabric and a reinforcing 
cord formed of fibers is generally embedded in each 
body of those belts in order to fill the above requirement for 
the belts. Meanwhile, in recent years, there have been growing 
requirements of maintenance-free performance and increase in 
belt life from the viewpoints of particularly compaction and 
safety of a machine. Accompanying with the compaction of the machine, a belt 
driving system gradually shifts from two-shaft drive in which 
one driven shaft is driven to multi-shaft drive in which many 
driven shafts are simultaneously driven by one belt. Further, 
due to the tendency to reduce a pulley in diameter, the tension 
member is subjected to heavy flection by the multi-shaft 
drive. Therefore, in addition to the above characteristics, 
there is also a demand of flection fatigue resistance for the  
 
tension member of the belt. Furthermore, a high-performance belt such as a belt for 
continuous speed-shifting device requires high strength and 
heat resistance in order to be used under conditions of high 
temperature and heavy load. For a tension member of a timing belt for automobile and 
the like, there is now commonly used a glass cord or an aramid 
cord which have large modulus of elasticity. When the glass 
cords are used as tension members of the belt, due to its high 
coefficient of linear expansion, the belt has insufficient 
flection fatigue resistance though it has good adaptability to 
thermal expansion of a pulley or the like. The aramid cord has a characteristic of generating a 
thermal shrinkage though it has good flection fatigue resistance. 
When the aramid cords are used as tension members, 
thermal expansions of an engine and a pulley at the warming up 
of the engine invites a thermal shrinkage of the belt, thereby 
increasing the belt tension. This promotes the flection fatigue 
of the tension members and causes the failure of teeth. 
As a result, the failure of the transmission device may cause. 
On the contrary, in cold climates, the belt tension decreases. 
This generates an engagement failure between the belt and 
pulley at the starting of the engine so that the belt jumps.
