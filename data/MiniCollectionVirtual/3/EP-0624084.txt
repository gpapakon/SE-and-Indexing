<DESCRIPTION>
 CARDIAC ASSIST APPARATUS* Background of the Invention" Field of the InventionThe present invention is related to cardiac assist apparatus, and more5 particularly, to an improved peri-cardiac implant to assist systole and a peri- aortic device to assist diastole combination in which a regulator of improved design is provided.Description of Related ArtThe art described in this section is not intended to constitute an 0 admission that any patent, publication or other information referred to herein is "prior art" with respect to this invention, unless specifically designated as such. In addition, this section should not be construed to mean that a search has been made or that no other pertinent information as defined in 37 C.F.R. ยง 1 .56(a) exists. 5 Recently there have been developments to provide a cardiac assist cup attached to the heart ventricles and to pump and withdraw air from the cup to assist during systole and diastole, the pulses being coordinated with the rhythm of the heart. This development is described by G.L. Anstadt et al in "Prolonged Circulatory Support by Direct Mechanical Ventricular 0 Assistance", Trans. ASA/O 12:72-79 (1966) and D.B. Skinner in"Experimental and Clinical Evaluations of Mechanical Ventricular Assistance", The American Journal of Cardiology, 27:146 (1971 ) . Related information is also found in U.S. Patent No. 4,573,997 to Wisman et al. A broad range of information is available in the book entitled Transformed 5 Muscle For Cardiac Assist and Repair, edited by R. Chiu and I. Bourgeois,Futura Publishing Company, Inc. (1 990), particularly pp. 255-327. 

 The principle of the cardiac cup is to provide systolic assist to the heart similar to heart massage. The cup is placed around the sick heart. During systole, the heart is assisted by the diaphragm in the cup which contracts the ventricles. However, it is also necessary to deflate the diaphragm during diastole to allow the heart to receive coronary infusion of blood. This active deflation is viewed as critical for proper assist.Circulatory counterpuisation with the intra-aortic balloon is now a widely accepted form of cardiac assist. A major limitation is the patient's dependency on an external power source with its risk of infection and restriction in mobility. A totally implantable counterpuisation assist system would offer an important therapeutic option for patients with end-stage heart failure.Developments have also occurred which utilize a skeletal muscle, which has been transformed to be fatigue resistant, wrapped
