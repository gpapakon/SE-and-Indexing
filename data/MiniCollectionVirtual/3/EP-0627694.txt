<ABSTRACT>
An image processing method and apparatus extracts 
outline vectors from a binary image, by defining outline 

points at positions between white pixel area and black 
pixel area, closer to the black pixel area, to extract 

vectors representing the black pixel area smaller than 
the white pixel area. Outline vector patterns are 

defined in advance in consideration of the length and 
the direction of an object vector and the lengths and 

relative directions of preceding and subsequent vectors. 
Upon smoothing of the image, outline point after the 

smoothing are determined in accordance with an outline 
vector pattern that corresponds to the states of an 

object vector and its preceding and subsequent vectors 
in an outline.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to an image processing
method and apparatus for obtaining high-quality
enlarged/reduced image using outline information of a
binary image and, more particularly, to smoothing and
enlarging/reducing an outline vector extracted from
the binary image.A conventional image processing method comprises: a
detection step of taking out an object pixel in a
raster-scanning order and detecting pixel arrangement
vectors in horizontal and vertical
directions based on the state of the object pixel and its
peripheral pixels; a discrimination step of
discriminating the connection state of the pixel
arrangement vectors; and an extraction step of
extracting outline of image data.According to this method, an object pixel is taken
out in a raster-scanning order, and a horizontal pixel
arrangement vector and a vertical pixel arrangement
vector are detected based on the state of the object
pixel and the peripheral pixels. The connection state
between these vectors is discriminated, and outline of 
image data is extracted based on the discriminated
connecting state. This method extracts all the outlines
of an image during only one raster-scanning. As an
image memory for storing the whole image data is not
required, the memory capacity can be reduced. Further,
the extraction is performed not at the center of a
pixel, but at the outline of the pixel, thus outline
edge data having a useful width even with respect to a
narrow line such as an one-pixel width line can be
obtained. Moreover, this method extracts not only
outline of a connected pixel area in which at least one
of four pixels (rightward, leftward, upward and
downward pixels of the object pixel) are connected with
each other (hereinafter referred to as "4-connected
component"), including the object pixel but outline of a
connected pixel area in which at least one of eight
pixels (neighboring pixels of the object pixel) are
connected with each other (hereinafter referred to as
"8-connected component").As to extracting outlines of an 8-connected
component, respectively defining two outline points set
between two black pixels connected in a slant direction,
at each extraction with one of these pixels as an object
pixel, has been proposed as a rule for outline
extraction of an 8-connected component. This rule 
enables respective extracting units to operation
independent of the state of the other peripheral pixels.On the other hand, there is disclosed in European
Patent Application EP-A-0482862 an image processing
apparatus which uses binary image
