<ABSTRACT>
Chrominance signals of a digitized composite video 
signal are processed by including automatic phase control and 

automatic chroma control operations that use circuit elements 
that are concurrently available for both operations as well as 

for other signal processing operations. The automatic phase 
control operation calculates a phase error corresponding to a 

phase difference between a reference clock signal and a burst 
synchronization signal of the chrominance signal. The reference 

clock signal is generated in response to the phase error data, 
such that the phase error is minimized and the reference clock 

signal coincides with the burst synchronization signal. The 
automatic chroma control operation multiplies the chrominance 

signal by coefficient data corresponding to the difference 
between the chrominance signal and a reference value to generate 

a constant level chrominance signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and methods
for processing chrominance signals of a composite video signal,
and, more particularly, to apparatus and methods which
incorporate automatic phase control (APC) and automatic chroma
control (ACC) operations in processing chrominance signals.A composite video signal includes a modulated color
sub-carrier signal (chrominance signal), shown in Fig. 1A,
combined with a monochrome signal (luminance signal) and shown in
Fig. 1B. The chrominance signal contains information regarding
the color portion of an image, and this information is
represented by both the amplitude and phase of the chrominance
signal. Because color information is stored in the phase of the
signal, an operation that processes the chrominance signal must
be closely synchronized with the phase of the signal to avoid
loss of color information, such as the tint or hue of an image
recreated from the processed signal. Preferably, the phase of
the processing operation should be within 2Â° of the chrominance
signal.To maintain a precise phase relationship between the
transmitted chrominance signal and a chrominance signal
processing operation, a color synchronizing burst signal, shown
in Fig. 1A, is transmitted with the chrominance signal to provide
a phase reference for the processing operation. The color 
synchronizing burst is a short, unmodulated signal usually
consisting of nine cycles and is located on the back-porch of the
horizontal blanking interval, after the horizontal sync pulses.A chrominance processing operation uses the color
synchronizing burst to generate an internal reference signal.
The reference signal is generated by an Automatic Phase Control
(APC) operation which separates and amplifies the color
synchronizing burst signal, and then locks the phase of a local
reference oscillator of the same frequency as the burst signal to
the phase of burst signal.In analog chrominance signal processing, the phase-locking
is usually provided by a phase locked-loop, as shown in
Fig. 2, or a phase controlled oscillator. Typically, the phase-locked
loop is formed by a DC voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)
40, which generates the internal reference signal, in combination
with a phase detector 42 and a low pass filter 41. The phase
detector 42 is supplied with the VCO output signal and the color
synchronizing burst signal and generates a DC output having
polarity and amplitude proportional to the direction and
magnitude of the relative phase difference between the VCO output
signal and the
