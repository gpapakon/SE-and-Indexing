<ABSTRACT>
An interval [0, 1] of the output of neural network is equally 

divided into M (M being an integer of two or more), and the numbers or 
frequencies of data for the correct/incorrect patterns contained in the 

i-th interval [(i - 1)/M, i/M] are µ1i and µ0i, respectively (where, i = 

1 ... M). In this case, if this network provides an output contained in 
the i-th interval to unknown pattern data, this pattern is stored as a 

likelihood conversion table so that the pattern outputs likelihood P1i, 
which is a category, in an equation P1i = (µ1i + 1)/(µ1i + µ0i + 2). 

Then, when a value contained in the i-th interval [(i - 1)/M, i/M] is 

output from a neural network, the likelihood convertor receives it as an 
input and outputs P1i which is so to speak normalized likelihood. 
Because the intervention of such likelihood convertor makes it 
possible for each network to be adjusted to output likelihood, the 

variation of learning is corrected for the networks so that the output 
from each network can be compared with each other. That is, a category 

provided the highest likelihood can be determined to be the most 
probable candidate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a neural network, and more 
particularly, to an improvement in pattern recognition using a neural 
network. It has been known that, when a neural network is applied to pattern 
recognition, if a category set to be identified is not so large (for 
example, on the order of 50 categories), a pattern identification system 
with higher accuracy can be implemented by a single network in an 
attainable learning process and a period of time (see, for example, I. 
Guyon, P. Albrecht, Y. Le Cun, J. Denker, and W. Hubbard: "Design of a 
Neural Network Character Recognizer for a Touch Terminal," Pattern 
Recognition, Vol. 24, pp. 105-119, 1991). However, this approach has 
difficulty in attaining a pattern identification system which can be put 
in practical use for a system having several hundred categories of 
patterns to be identified, such as identification of similar hand written 
characters in Japanese. Then, the method conventionally practiced for identifying patterns 
with many categories is one which first roughly classifies all categories 
into several classes, and uses a separate neural network for each class 
for detailed identification (Y. Kojima, T. Koda, H. Takagi, and Y. 
Shimegi: "A Study on Generalizability of Neural Networks," Proceedings 
of National Meeting of IECE Japan 1990, 6-5; I. Hayashi: "Method for 
Integrating a Neural Network and Fuzzy Control," Electronics Technology, 
1992-1, pp. 17; and A. Iwata, T. Toma, K. Matsuo, and N. Suzumura: "A 
Large Scale Four Layer Neural Network - CombNET," The Transactions of 
IECE Japan, Section J, D-II, Vol. 73-D-II, pp. 1261-1267, 1991-20). This 
is a method which adopts a category providing the largest output in 
networks selected for rough classification as a correct candidate. 
However, this method has such a problem that, because learning by a 
network is performed for a limited amount of learning data, the degree of 
learning necessarily differs from one network to another so that it 
becomes difficult to determine the result of identification merely by 
comparing outputs among a number of networks.  Additional publications relating to pattern recognition using 
neural networks includes the following. PUPA No. 3-67381 relates to a character recognition system suitable 
for recognizing hand written or printed character patterns composed of 
two-dimensional dot matrices such as those read by an image scanner. It 
discloses to extract characteristics from hand written or printed 
character patterns read by an image
