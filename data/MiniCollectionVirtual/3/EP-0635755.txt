<ABSTRACT>
Silver iodobromide tabular grain emulsions of 
enhanced photographic sensitivity are disclosed. The 

silver iodobromide grains contain from 2 to less than 
10 mole percent iodide, exhibit a coefficient of 

variation of less than 20 percent, and consisting 
essentially of tabular grains having opposed parallel 

major faces. Each of the tabular silver bromoiodide 
grains exhibit an iodide concentration in excess of 6 

mole percent within a surface region extending to a 
depth of less than 0.02 µm and exhibit a central iodide 

concentration of less than 2 mole percent. 
The tabular grain emulsion is prepared by 
providing within a reaction vessel a population of 

silver bromide or iodobromide host grains exhibiting a 

coefficient of variation of less than 20 percent and 
containing less than 2 mole percent iodide consisting 

essentially of tabular grains and introducing silver, 
bromide and iodide ions into the reaction vessel for 

deposition onto the major faces on the host tabular 
grains, with iodide ions accounting for at least 25 

mole percent of total halide ions introduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to photographic
emulsions and to processes for their preparation.In referring to silver halide grain
structures and emulsions containing two or more halides
the halides are named starting with the halide present
in the lowest concentration and ending with the halide
present in the highest concentration.Emulsions containing grains formed of silver
combined with chloride, bromide, iodide or any possible
mixture of these halides are known to form latent
images upon exposure to visible or near ultraviolet
radiation and can be employed for photographic
purposes. The photographically least used silver
halide grain compositions are high iodide (>90 mole
percent iodide, based on silver) silver halides. The
iodide ion released during development inhibits further
development and, unless addressed in developer
formulation, can effectively arrest grain development.
Although the remaining silver halide compositions have
application specific advantages, the most widely
employed photographic emulsions are silver
iodobromides, since they exhibit the highest attainable
levels of photographic sensitivity and exhibit superior
speed-granularity relationships. The incorporation of
iodide ions into the face centered cubic silver bromide
crystal lattice of the grains has been demonstrated to
enhance the efficiency of latent image formation.
Silver iodobromide emulsions are almost universally
used for camera speed photography.Kofron et al U.S. Patent 4,439,520, Wilgus et
al U.S. Patent 4,434,226 and Solberg et al U.S. Patent
4,433,048 were the first to point out the photographic 
advantages of tabular grain silver iodobromide
emulsions. Among numerous advantages resulting from
the tabular shape of the grains were improvements in
photographic sensitivity and speed-granularity
relationships. As clearly shown in Figure 1 of Wilgus
et al and Figure 3 of Kofron et al, the iodobromide
tabular grain emulsions contained a variety of grain
shapes and exhibited considerable variance among the
tabular grains. The tabular grain emulsions were not
monodisperse, regardless of whether the entire grain
population or only the tabular grain population is
considered in assessing grain dispersity.Tsaur et al U.S. Patent 5,210,013 discloses
the preparation of highly monodisperse tabular grain
silver bromide and iodobromide emulsions. Tabular
grain emulsions are disclosed exhibiting a coefficient
of variation (hereinafter also referred to as COV) of
less than 10 percent based on the total grain
population. The tabular grain
