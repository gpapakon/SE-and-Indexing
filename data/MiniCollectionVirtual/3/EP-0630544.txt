<ABSTRACT>
Filing compressed digital images requires maximum data compression with a predetermined image quality. According to an image-adaptive regulation process of the quantification interval during image data reduction, the optimum Q-factor is derived from mean image intensity and contrast.

Process for the image-adaptive regulation of the 
length of a quantisation interval in image data reduction 

of an image, comprising the following steps: 

a) the mean image intensity 

M = 
1
N
 Σ
i,k
 p
i,k
 
is determined from the non-quantised intensity values p
i,k
 
of all image dots 1 ≤ i ≤ I, 1 ≤ k ≤ K of the image, 

where N=I·K is the total number of image dots; 
b) the image contrast 

C = 
1
2N
 Σ
i,k
 (
p
i,k
 - p
i+1,k
+
p
i,k
 - p
i,k+1
) 
 
is determined, where 1 ≤i ≤ I-1 and 1 ≤ k ≤ K-1; 
c) the length Δ of the quantisation interval is 
divided by a factor Q, which is a monotonic function f of 

the variable M - a·C, i.e. 

Q = f (M - a·C) 
 
where a is a constant and 1 ≃ a ≃ 10. 
Process according to Claim 1, wherein a ≃ 4. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein f is a step by step constant step function. 
Process according to Claim 3, wherein 

Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
wherein f is a linear function 


f(x) = b + c·x 
Process according to Claim 5, wherein b = 0.8 and 
c = 0.002. 
Use of a process according to one of the preceding 
claims for the determination of the Q-factor in a  

 
JPEG data compression process. 
Use of a process according to one of the preceding 
claims for the data-compressed archiving of 

fingerprints. 
Use of a process according to one of the preceding 
claims for the determination of the Q-factor in a 

JPEG data compression process for the compressed 
archiving of fingerprints.
