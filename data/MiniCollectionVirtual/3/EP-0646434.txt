<ABSTRACT>
A laser beam 
machining method capable of 

preventing the occurrence of 
a notch portion (burn-through) 

at a machining terminating 
point on a product even when 

a work is machined into a 
shape in which a machining 

starting point and machining 
terminating point agree with 

each other, and an apparatus 
used therefor. A boring and 

periphery machining operations 
are started with a boring 

operation at a point P, and a 
cutting operation is then carried 

out from the point P to a point 
Q. A periphery machining 

operation is started at the point 
Q, and this cutting operation is 

carried out along a path 40 up 
to a point R. At the point R, 

the machining conditions are 
changed, and the laser beam 

reaches a point S, at which the 
periphery machining operation 

is completed. In order to carry 
out this boring and periphery machining operations, a CNC (10) subtracts a very short distance ΔL1 between the 

points Q, S from a one-round machining path which starts at the point Q, to generate the machining path 40, which 
is then stored in a memory. This very short distance ΔL1 is set to such a level that permits the portion of the work 

which is on the inner side of the periphery thereof to be removed speedily at the time of completion of the periphery 
machining operation. Since the machining finishing point S is set by subtracting the very short distance ΔL1 from a 

one round machining path without having the starting and finishing points Q, S of the periphery machining operation 
agree with each other, the occurrence of a notch portion, which is encountered in a machining operation in which the 

starting and finishing points Q, S agree with each other, can be avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laser-beam machining 
method of machining a workpiece by irradiating a laser beam 
thereon and a system therefor, and more particularly to a 
laser-beam machining method suitable for machining a shape 
having a machining start point and a machining end point 
coincident with each other. Conventionally, when a workpiece is machined to a 
shape by a laser beam along a machining path having a 
start point and an end point coincident with each other, 
such as hole cutting, cutting of the shape is actually 
started at the start point of the machining path and ended 
at the end point which is coincident with the start point. Now, a conventional process for cutting a hole 
will be described with reference to FIG. 4(A) and FIG. 4(B). 
As shown in FIG. 4(A), the hole-cutting process is 
conventionally started by piercing at a point P1, from 
which cutting is performed to a point Q1. Then, hole-circumference 
cutting is started at the point Q1 and 
continued, making one turn around the circumference of the 
hole, back to the point Q1.  However, this hole-cutting process can result in a 
nick (burn through) formed at the point Q1 corresponding 
both to the start point of the hole-circumference cutting 
and the end point of same, as shown in FIG 4(B). The nick 
is formed by an excessive meltdown of a lower-side portion 
of a plate of the workpiece, and this makes the cut surface 
not perpendicular to the lower surface of the plate. The 
nick is more liable to occur as the thickness of the plate 
is larger. The existence of such a nick in a component 
part may not only cause a crack or breakage to a machined 
product due to stress concentrated thereon, but also impair 
an appearance of the machined product. Therefore, 
formation of a nick has been a disadvantage of the laser-beam 
machining. On the other hand, to prevent formation of such a 
nick e.g. in a case of cutting off mild steel, a method is 
proposed which is characterized by switching assist gas 
from oxygen gas to air before the machining end point for 
blunting the cutting operation. This method, however, 
cannot achieve markedly advantageous effects. Further, an 
attempt has also been made to modify a machining path along 
the circumference of a shape to be cut, without achieving 
advantageous results, as well. Under these circumstances, experiments as 
illustrated in FIG. 5(A) and FIG. 5(B) are made to 
investigate into the mechanism of formation of a nick. In 
an experiment shown in FIG. 5(A), piercing is effected at a  
 
p
