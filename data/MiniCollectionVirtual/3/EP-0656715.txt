<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an adjustable support 
arrangement by means of which an apparatus can be adjusted to 

different positions of inclination in relation to a supportive 
surface, such as a telephone apparatus on a table surface. 

The arrangement includes at least one apparatus foot, wherein 
one end of the apparatus rests on the supportive surface and 

the other end of the apparatus rests on the foot. The bottom 
of the apparatus includes a hinge means in which one end of 

the foot can be rotated and snapped-in. According to the 
invention, the bottom of the apparatus (1) is provided with at 

least one stop ledge (19) which is spaced from the hinge means 
(6, 16), and the apparatus foot (3) is provided with a stop 

cleat (9) which in a first position abuts the stop ledge (19). 
The stop cleat (9) is provided with a lever (11) which, when 

pressed, will cause the stop cleat (9) to move resiliently to 
one side and therewith be able to pass the stop ledge (19), 

wherewith the apparatus foot (3) is folded-in to a second 
position relative to the bottom of the apparatus (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjustable support arrangement 
by means of which an apparatus can be brought to different 
angles of inclination in relation to a supportive 
surface, for instance a telephone apparatus on a table top. 
The arrangement includes at least one apparatus foot, wherein 
one end of the apparatus supports against the supportive 
surface and the other end supports against the apparatus foot. 
The bottom of the apparatus is provided with a hinge means 
into which one end of the apparatus foot can be rotatably 
inserted with a snap-in action. In order to obtain good ergonomy, for instance to enable a 
display and designations to be readily discerned by eliminating 
reflections and shadows, and to enable the keys of a 
telephone key pad for instance to be manipulated effectively, 
it is necessary to provide an adjustable foot or base which 
will enable the body of the apparatus to be brought to 
different angles of inclination. The foot shall be stable and 
easy to handle when making the adjustment, and it shall also 
be easy to fit and to dismantle when using the apparatus 
alternatively on a table or on a wall, and will also be 
capable of being produced at a low cost and have an attractive 
design. The foot must also provide good handling stability to 
the apparatus assembly. Examples of known solutions of this problem utilize an 
additional detail, a U-shaped element or the like, which is 
placed in different positions on the foot part of the adjustable 
support. Other solutions to the problem utilize only 
one single detail, although in this case the bottom of the 
apparatus rests against the top of the table when in its lower  
 
inclined position, for instance a keyboard having an adjustable 
foot or feet. These know solutions have the drawback of being expensive and 
complicated in manufacture and also in their handling, and do 
not impart good stability to the apparatus. The object of the present invention is to avoid the aforesaid 
drawbacks and to provide an adjustable support arrangement of 
simple construction which is inexpensive in manufacture, 
simple to adjust to different angles of inclination and which 
will impart good stability to the apparatus in all positions. This object is achieved with a construction which is comprised 
of an element, an apparatus foot, and functional elements 
formed in the bottom of the apparatus, such as hinge means, 
guide means, hooks for defining outer stop positions, stop 
means for determining different positions of

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable support arrangement for enabling an apparatus 
to be brought to different positions of inclination in 

relation to a supportive surface, wherein the arrangement 
includes at least one apparatus foot, wherein one end of the 

apparatus rests on the supportive surface and the other end of 
the apparatus supports against the apparatus foot, and wherein 

the bottom of the apparatus includes a part which has the form 

of a hinge pivot means and in which one end of the apparatus 
foot can be rotated and snapped-in, characterized in that the 

bottom of the apparatus (1) includes at least one stop ledge 
(19) which is spaced from the hinge pivot means (6, 16); in 

that the apparatus foot (3) includes a stop cleat or shoulder 
(9) which in a first position abuts the stop ledge (19); and 

in that the stop cleat or shoulder (9) is provided with a 
lever (11) which, when pressed, will cause the stop cleat (9) 

to move resiliently to one side and therewith be able to pass 
the stop ledge (19), wherewith the apparatus foot (3) is 

folded into a second position in relation to the bottom of the 
apparatus. 
An arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the apparatus foot (3) includes a rectangular frame (5); and 

in that the apparatus bottom is provided with an outwardly 
projecting rectangular part (15) on which the stop ledge (19) 

is disposed, wherein the part (15) is adapted to the frame (5) 
such as to guide rotation of the foot (3) in relation to the 

apparatus. 
An arrangement according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the frame (5) and the outwardly projecting part (15) are 

provided with mutually coacting stop cams (14, 18) which 
restrict rotation of the foot (3) away from the apparatus. 
An arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the stop cleat (9) and the lever (11) are joined by means of 

stiffening ribs (12). 
An arrangement according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the stop ledge (19) is triangular in shape and when the foot 

(3) is folded-in or collapsed is accommodated in the space 
define between the stop cleat (9) and the stiffening ribs 

(12), and when the apparatus foot (3) is folded-out or 
extended functions as a support surface which presses the stop 

cleat (9) to one side so that the foot is able to move to its 
first position. 
An arrangement according to claim 2, characterized in that 
a plurality of stop ledges (19) are disposed one above the 

other on the outwardly projecting part (15).
