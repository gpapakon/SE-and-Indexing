<ABSTRACT>
Consisting of a cellular mobile communications network (CS) that
provides coverage of voice and/or data communications services to

terminals located in a set of cells in any one of which there can be at least one
fixed cellular terminal (4) that communicates, on one side, by radio, with one

of the base stations (3) of the cellular mobile communications network (CS)
and on the other side, by cable, with at least one base station (6) of a cordless

communications system (WS) through control and interface means that
perform the adaptation between the two systems to provide communications

services to a number of cordless terminals (7).
When the cellular communication system (CS) makes use of time
division multiple access technology, TDMA, for example GSM, one single

radio transceiver is connected to a transceiver control means to manage the
radio channel allocations, so that it can support simultaneously as many

communications channels as possible without there being temporal
overlapping of channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a communications system for the provision 
of voice and/or data services to a set of terminals either in the form of 
telephones or of any other kind (facsimile machines, data modems, etc.), in 
environments where there is still no fixed communications infrastructure, or 
where the latter is already saturated and an operational "island" is planned 
where this communications service will be offered. The system described in this document is of particular application in 
zones where there exists coverage by some cellular mobile service, though it 
also is of great interest in zones where there is no such service and an 
installation is required urgently or where the cost is less than that of a fixed 
service. The problem of providing a communications service in a very short 
space of time to certain environments where there is still no infrastructure 
(as usually occurs in new development areas outside large cities), or in those 
zones where there already exists such an infrastructure but which is now 
saturated, has resulted in numerous resources having been dedicated to the 
definition and design of specific networks that provide a solution for this 
situation, this solution being preferably based on existing networks or new 
ones that are easy and quick to install. Since the introduction of cellular mobile systems, their use has been 
extended to other purposes than those for which they were originally 
conceived. One of the most attractive from the point of view outlined above 
is that known as "fixed cellular network", which is based on the use of 
terminals compatible with the cellular network of which it makes use, in a 
fixed environment. The antenna of the system is usually lodged in a fixed 
site (normally on roofs) and is usually of the directional type, pointed 
towards the base station that covers the cell in which it is located. All this is explained in the US patent 4658096, in which the base 
stations of a cellular system communicate with fixed cellular terminals that 
comprise the corresponding interface systems each of which offers a single 
subscriber line to which may be connected a standard telephone, as well as 
with the corresponding cellular mobile terminals. In the same document a  
 
configuration is also shown in which a communications service is provided 
for a number of standard telephones, all of the latter being connected to a 
unit that acts as a concentrator for sharing the communications channels 
offered by a smaller number of fixed cellular

FIXED CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM composed 
by a first cellular mobile communications network (CS) that provides 

communications coverage for voice and/or data services, in which in any of 
the cells there is at least one fixed cellular terminal (4) that communicates by 

radio with one of the base stations (3) and characterised in that the fixed 
cellular terminal (4) is joined to at least one base station equipment (6) of a 

cordless communications system (WS), through control and interface means 
(9) that perform the adaptation of information and control channels between 

the two systems, in order to provide communications services to a number of 
cordless terminals (7). 
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM according to claim 1 
characterised in that the fixed cellular terminal (4) that communicates with 

at least one base station (3) of the cellular mobile communications network 
(CS) comprises at least one cellular transceiver obtained from a cellular 

mobile terminal, at least one base station transceiver of a cordless 
communications system (WS) and control and interface means (9) that 

incorporate the functions for adapting the two transceivers of the cellular 

and cordless systems, and for concentrating, when this is necessary, the 
number of channels offered to the number of channels available. 
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM according to claim 1 
characterised in that the control and interface means (9) that perform the 

adaptation of the two systems, cellular and cordless, also permit the 
connection of standard terminals (5) through telephone lines or by means of 

radiolink equipments (8). 
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM according to claims 1 and 2 
characterised in that both the cellular mobile communications network (CS) 

and the cordless communications system (WS) can be of either the analogue 
or of the digital type. 
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM according to claim 1 
characterised in that the control and interface means (9) also permit the 

setting up of internal communications between cordless terminals (7) 
without making use of the communications channels of the cellular network, 

and the centralising of the communications channels offered to both the 
cordless terminals (7) and to the fixed terminals (5). 
FIXED CELLULAR TERMINAL for use in above cellular mobile 
networks (CS) that communicates with at least one of its base stations (3) in 

order to provide voice and/or data communications to one or more 
subscribers characterised in that it comprises a single cellular radio 

transceiver (RTX) of time division multiple access, TDMA, technology, and 
transceiver control means (19) connected to this cellular transceiver (RTX) to 

manage the radio channels, so that they can support simultaneously as many 
communications channels as possible without there being temporal 

overlapping of channels, so that it is possible to offer the same number of 
subscriber lines through the corresponding subscriber line interfaces (SL). 
FIXED CELLULAR TERMINAL according to claim 6, 
characterised in that it also comprises control and interface means (9) that 

extend the number of channels available through the cellular transceiver into 
a greater number of subscriber lines. 
FIXED CELLULAR TERMINAL according to claim 6 
characterised in that instead of a single cellular radio transceiver (RTX), it 

comprises a number of these connected, on the radiofrequency side, to a 
single antenna system (ANT) in order to make available a greater number of 

communications channels. 
FIXED CELLULAR TERMINAL according to claim 8, 
characterised in that it also communicates with a second communications 

network with cellular access or with another communications network of 
different types through point to point or point to multipoint radiolinks in 

order to provide another number of alternative channels.
