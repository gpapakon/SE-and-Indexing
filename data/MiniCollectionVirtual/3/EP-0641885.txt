<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wet non-woven fabric 
and a method for producing the same, and, more 
specifically, to a wet non-woven fabric having an 
excellent water absorption property and a method for 
producing the same. Non-woven fabrics having an excellent water 
absorption property have already been commercialized. 
Most of them are dry non-woven fabrics. To improve their 
water absorption percentage, absorptive polymer fibers or 
particles are contained in the dry non-woven fabrics. In 
the paper making case where the absorptive polymer fibers 
or particles are mixed with a wet non-woven fabric, as an 
absorptive polymer fiber or particle generally used has a 
diameter as large as 0.5 to 2.0 mm, the water absorptive 
polymer fiber or particle swells to approximately 1000 
times its original size and has a diameter of several 
millimeters at mixing with water. Consequently, the water 
absorptive polymer fiber or particle has the disadvantage 
that it excludes other fibers at the time of paper-forming 
and falls off from the non-woven fabric when it is dried 
after paper-making. Furthermore, the water absorptive polymer fiber 
or particle has another disadvantage that an increase in 
its mixing ratio with the fabric lowers the strength of 
the wet non-woven fabric. Therefore, to overcome this 
disadvantage, the absorptive polymer fiber or particle is 
dispersed between layers of a laminate. However, this 
method requires additional cost for stacking layers, thus 
boosting costs.  Japanese Patent Publication No. 55202/1986 
discloses a method which comprises the steps of 
impregnating a non-woven fabric with a monomer before 
polymerization and then polymerizing the monomer. Since 
the method requires an intricate apparatus, a large amount 
of initial investment is necessary, also inviting an 
increase in costs. An object of the invention is to provide a wet 
non-woven fabric having a uniform water absorption 
property. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
method for producing the wet non-woven fabric of the 
invention with ease at a low cost. Other objects and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent in the following description. Firstly, according to the present invention, the 
above-mentioned objects and advantages of the invention 
are attained by a wet non-woven fabric which comprises (A) 
a highly water absorptive polymer in an amount of 5 to 60 
% by weight and (B) pulp in an amount of 40 to 95 % by 
weight, based on the total weight of the components (A) 
and (B).
