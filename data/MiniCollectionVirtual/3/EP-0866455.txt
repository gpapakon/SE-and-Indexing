<ABSTRACT>
In a wobble signal detecting circuit provided by the
present invention, a wobble signal is converted into

binary data before being supplied to a PLL circuit by way
of a polarity switching circuit and a clock switching

circuit. The PLL circuit outputs a recording/playback
timing generation clock signal. The frequency of the

recording/playback timing generation clock signal is
divided by a frequency dividing circuit before being fed

back to the PLL circuit. A difference in phase between the
wobble signal and the feedback signal is detected by a

phase inversion detecting circuit and, if the difference
in phase exceeds a phase difference determined in advance,

the phase inversion detecting circuit generates a polarity
switching signal for switching the polarity of the wobble

signal. The polarity switching signal is used to invert
the polarity of the polarity switching circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
In general, the present invention relates to an
information processing technology which is capable of
recording and reproducing information with a high degree
of reliability. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a wobble signal detecting circuit for detecting
a wobble signal obtained from a recording medium such as a
disk, a wobble abnormality detecting circuit for detecting
an abnormality of the wobble signal, an information
processing apparatus or method using these wobble signal
and wobble abnormality detecting circuits and a recording
medium used in the apparatus or method.As a recording medium used in recording and playback
operations, there has been developed a recording medium
that is provided with groove tracks as well as land tracks
created on a board thereof and infinitesimally wobbling in
the radial direction and provided with information
recording areas on both the groove and land (inter-groove)
tracks. The recording medium has a predetermined wobble
pattern. In a recording or playback operation, by using a
wobble signal based on this wobble pattern, position 
information or a position signal is obtained. An operation
to record or play back information is based on the
position signal.In the conventional technology, a wobble signal
based on a wobble pattern originated from such a recording
medium may not be generated normally due to a defect on
the recording medium or a control deviation occurring in a
playback operation, resulting in a miss which gives rise
to a problem that position information or a position
signal can not be obtained in a recording or playback
operation.Document US-A-5,508,995 shows an optical recording medium including a
groove track and a land track; each divided into a plurality of sectors. Each sector
has an ID region, a servo region and an information region. First and second wobble
pits are provided on both sides of the center line of each track and they are
spaced with each other in the direction of the track. According to US-A-5,508,995,
the center of the track can be detected accurately by these first and
second wobble pits.Document US-A-5,566,141 shows a track retrieving method detecting a middle
point between adjacent tracks of an information medium, in which medium the
polarity of a tracking control is alternately inverted in the tracks. By detecting a
change in a polarity of the track middle-point signal, it is detected that the light
beam reading the information medium reaches the middle-point between the adjacent
tracks.It is thus an object of
