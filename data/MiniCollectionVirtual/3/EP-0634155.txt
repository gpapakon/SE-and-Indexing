<ABSTRACT>
A knee prosthesis includes a femoral component in 
which the condyles have a continuous contact surface for 

the tibial bearing surface and in which the sagittal 
radius is constant from posterior to a point more anterior 

than the distalmost point. The tibial bearing surface is 
shaped to have a curvature which corresponds closely with 

that of the femoral condylar surfaces. The tibial 
component includes a plastics meniscus component (203) supported 

on a metal platform (201) for sliding movement in the anterior posterior 
direction and the mating surface between the 

meniscus (203) and platform (201) has a sagittal curvature which is 
larger than the sagittal radius of the femoral condyles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to prostheses for knee
replacement. The features of the preamble of claim 1 are known from the document FR-A-2 663 536.Most of the knee replacement designs in current use
are of the Condylar Replacement type, where the arthritic
joint surfaces are resected and are replaced with metal
and plastic surfaces. There are two conflicting
requirements in design; first, the desirability for
freedom of motion requires relatively low conformity
between the femoral and tibial surfaces, while the
desirability for low contact stresses on the plastic
surface requires high conformity. This conflict similarly
applies to the patello-femoral bearing joint.The present invention provides several approaches to
a solution of this dilemma. First, it provides a femoral
component which alters the sagittal radius and which has
continuous contact surfaces for the tibial surface and
also, preferably, with the patella surface. Secondly,
the invention relates to a sliding bearing type of
prosthesis where guide tracks for the tibial bearing
surface are curved in the sagittal plane to provide the
necessary stability, as well as freedom for translational
motion in the anterior-posterior direction. The above two broad concepts may be combined in a
single prosthesis or employed individually depending on
the requirements of a particular case. The invention
also includes variations of the above concepts and various
designs of tibial components.Another problem in the design of a knee prosthesis is
to provide for the proper degree of rotational freedom of
motion, without at the same time leading to an unstable
linkage or one which is insufficiently robust to withstand
loadings and movement during walking. The invention is
therefore also directed in another aspect to an artificial
knee joint in which this problem is addressed.According to the invention there is
provided a knee prosthesis which comprises the features of claim 1. The prostheses of this invention are of the condylar
replacement type. In prostheses of this type, some or
all of the natural collateral and cruciate ligaments are
retained to give stability to the artificial joint.
Often, because of the difficulty in resecting the natural
joint surfaces without damaging the cruciate ligaments, it
is the practice to resect at least the posterior cruciate
ligament. However, the collateral ligaments are
generally retained.Normally, the condylar surfaces of the femoral
component are shaped to conform quite closely with the
depressions or concavities in the meniscal
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A prosthesis for knee replacement which comprises:-

(a) a femoral component having a pair of condylar bearing surfaces (31,32);
(b) a tibial component (301,401,602) including a tibial platform;
(c) a meniscal component (303,403,607) located between the femoral and
tibial components for transmitting a load therebetween, said meniscal component having

depressions for receiving the condylar surfaces, and being arranged for sliding movement
in a generally anterior-posterior (
A-P) direction on said tibial platform; and
(d) guide means (302,408,601) associated with said platform and comprising a
first projection engaging in the meniscal component between said depressions, wherein

said meniscal component is guided for sliding movement in an anterior-posterior (A-P)
direction, and wherein rotational movement of said meniscal component is limited by a

second projection (407,603,604) on the tibial platform, 
characterised in that
 the first
projection is a post and cap which is substantially "T"-shaped in cross-section and engages

for sliding motion in a correspondingly shaped slot (404,605) formed within the meniscal
component so that the meniscal component is restrained from lifting off the tibial platform,

the slot being open at one end to permit entry of the post and cap and closed at the other
(406,606), and limits sliding motion of the meniscal component in the anterior or posterior

direction.
A prosthesis according to claim 1 wherein the cap (409,610) is
substantially circular when viewed in plan.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the post
is positioned on said tibial platform substantially on its centre line (L-C) extending in the

A-P direction.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the
guide means is a snap fit in the slot. 
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the slot
is open at one end (620) to facilitate fitting of the meniscal component on the guide

means.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the
tibial base plate includes an anterior projection (604) positioned to limit anterior sliding

movement of the meniscal component on the tibial base plate.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the
tibial base plate includes a posterior projection (407,603) positioned to limit posterior

sliding movement of the meniscal component on the tibial base plate.
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 8 wherein the posterior projection is
located on said tibial platform medially of its centre line extending in the A-P direction.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein each
said condylar bearing surface has an anterior portion, a posterior portion and a distalmost

point therebetween, wherein the radius of the bearing surface in each sagittal section is
substantially constant from posterior to a point more anterior than the distalmost point,

and the bearing surfaces in the respective sagittal sections of the condylar surfaces and the
corresponding meniscal depressions being substantially continuous from posterior to

anterior, whereby contact can be maintained across a substantial width of the condylar
surface throughout the range of flexion.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which the
tibial platform and the meniscal component are cut away posteriorly to provide space for

cruciate ligaments.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the
tibial platform and femoral component are of metal and the meniscal component is a

plastics material.
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 11 wherein the plastics material is of
polyethylene.
