<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED METHOD FOR FORMING PNP AND NPN BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR IN A SAME SUBSTRATEFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to bipolar transistors and, in particular, to an improved method for forming PNP and NPN bipolar transistors in a same substrate.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTo decrease the fabrication time and therefore to decrease the cost of forming integrated circuits, the number of masking steps, etching steps, doping steps, and drive-in steps should be held to a minimum. In addition, the number of critical mask alignments, where one mask pattern must be precisely aligned with respect to another mask pattern, should also be held to a minimum to simplify the fabrication process. Therefore, any processes which form circuit components using less and/or simpler process steps than those already used to form the circuit components are very valuable. It is often desirable to form both PNP and NPN bipolar transistors on a same substrate. When forming a lateral PNP bipolar transistor on a same substrate as an NPN bipolar transistor (whether vertical or lateral) , it has been known to form the P+ collector and emitter regions of the lateral PNP transistor using the same masking, doping, and drive-in steps as used to form a P+ base region of the NPN transistor. Such a resulting structure is illustrated in Fig. 1.Generally, to form the structure of Fig. 1, an N- epitaxial layer 10 is deposited or grown over a P- substrate 12 and N+ buried layer regions 13.A masking, etching, doping, and drive-in step is used to form the highly conductive and deep P++ isolation region 14, which isolates one portion of epitaxial layer 

10 from another portion. Such a portion isolated by isolation region 14 is sometimes referred to as a tub. Isolation region 14 is formed so as to make contact with the underlying P- substrate 12. After isolation region 14 is formed, a next masking, etching, doping, and drive-in process is conducted to deposit and drive-in P-type dopants to concurrently form the P+ contact region for isolation region 14, the P+ collector and emitter regions of the PNP lateral transistor, and the P+ base region of the NPN transistor. These regions, after drive-in, are identified in Fig. 1 as P+ regions 15, 16, 17, and 18, respectively. Although the cross-section of Fig. 1 shows two collector regions 16, these regions 16 are part of a same ring and are thus considered one region.Since these P+ regions 15-18 are all formed in the same process, they must all have the same conductivity and depth. It is well known
