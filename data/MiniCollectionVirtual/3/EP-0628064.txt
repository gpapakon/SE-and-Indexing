<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain novel naphthopyran compounds. More particularly, this invention
relates to novel photochromic naphthopyran compounds with unexpected properties, and to compositions and articles
containing such novel naphthopyran compounds. When exposed to light radiation involving ultraviolet (UV) rays, such
as the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight or the light of a mercury lamp, many photochromic compounds exhibit a reversible
change in color. When the ultraviolet radiation is discontinued, the photochromic compound will return to its original
color or colorless state.Various classes of photochromic compounds have been synthesized and suggested for use in applications
in which a sunlight-induced reversible color change or darkening is desired. US-A-3,567,605 (Becker) describes a
series of chromene derivatives, including certain benzopyrans and naphthopyrans. These compounds are described
as derivatives of chromene and are reported to undergo a color change, e.g., from colorless to yellow-orange, on
irradiation by ultraviolet light at temperatures below about -40°C. irradiation of the compounds with visible light or upon
raising the temperature to within the range of -10°C. to 0°C. is reported to reverse the coloration to a colorless state.
US-A-4,931,221 describes a series of spiropyrans in which two cyclopropyl groups are appended to the position adjacent
to the oxygen in the pyran ring. US-A-4,563,458 describes certain 2H-chromenes as precursors of certain chroman-4-aldehydes,
which are reacted with certain amines to prepare 4-aminomethylene-chromans and -chromenes
that are used in medicaments.EP-A-0 246,114 and US-A-4,826,977 describe a series of photochromic spiropyrans in which a spiro-adamantane
group is appended to the position adjacent to the oxygen in the pyran ring. US-A-4,818,096 and EP-A-0
250,193 describe photoreactive plastic lenses that are coated or impregnated with the photochromic spiropyrans of
EP-A-0 246,114 in combination with a photochromic benzopyran or naphthopyran having an aminophenyl substituent
at the position adjacent to the oxygen in the pyran ring. EP-A-0 294,056 describes a process for producing a polyurethane
plastic having photochromic properties. Reversible cleavage photochromic compounds disclosed therein
include a naphthopyran derivative in which the pyran ring is substituted at the 3-position of the pyran ring with di(p-methoxyphenyl)
substituents. JP-A- HEI 2(1990)-69471 describes spiropyran compounds in which a norbornylidene
group is
