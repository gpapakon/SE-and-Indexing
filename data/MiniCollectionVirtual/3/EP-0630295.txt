<CLAIMS>
A method for reducing scale formation during the hot 
rolling of metal, in particular steel, in which the 

heated metal is briefly plastically deformed with an 
elastic portion at high pressure and then can be stress 

relieved, whereby the rolling stock is covered with inert 
gas at the outlet side,
 
characterised in that the rolling stock leaving the roll 

gap (6) is only blown with the inert gas over that 
distance (E) inside which the stress relief of the 

elastic deformation portion occurs. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the inert gas is also blown into 

the spaces of the roll gap (6) lying laterally next to 
the rolling stock. 
A device for performing the method according to Claim 1 
or 2 on a roll stand for the hot rolling of metal, in 

which a device for the supply of inert gas, which 
comprises a plurality of nozzles directed towards the 

forming stock, is connected to the roll stand,
 
characterised in that means (23, 28, 48, 49) are 

provided, with which the supply of inert gas after hot 
rolli
ng can be extended and limited after the roll gap 
(6) to the distance (E) corresponding to the elastic 

stress relief phase of the respective rolling stock. 
A device according to Claim 3,
 
characterised in that the means contain housing 

components in which the inert gas can build up to a 
pressure higher than atmospheric pressure.
