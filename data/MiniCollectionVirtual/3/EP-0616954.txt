<ABSTRACT>
The tank (1) which can be set up individually or in sets and is designed as a safety tank for storing oil consists of an internal container (2), produced by blow-moulding and made of high-pressure polyethylene, and of an external container (3) which bears against said internal container and is made of hot galvanised steel plate with fluid-tight welds. In the upper end (4) of the internal container (2) of each tank (1) of a tank set there are a filling nozzle (5) connected to a filling line (6), a removal nozzle (8) connected to a removal line (7), a venting nozzle (9) for connection to a venting line (10), and a nozzle (11) for inserting a filling-level indicator (12). The different connection nozzles (5, 8, 9 and 11) are accessible via a cutout (14) in the lid (13) of the external container (3). For the purposes of installation and transportation, the tanks (1) are fixed on tubular steel pallets (17).
