<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a foldable article (1) of 
furniture, such as a chair, which has a support surface 

(2), normally a seat portion, pivotally connected to 
underlying support leg means (10, 12). The support surface 

comprises a first section (3) and a second section (5), 
each of which is pivotally connected to a respective one of 

the support leg means (10, 12) as well as to each other. In 
this way a neatly and compactly foldable article is 

provided without requiring any sliding pivots or joints.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to foldable articles of furniture as defined in the preamble of 
claim 1. Such an article of furniture is known from US-A-1 959 046 for example. In particular the invention relates to articles of furniture which are more commonly 
known as foldable or collapsible items, such as collapsible chairs, collapsible benches 
or the like. US-A-1 959 046 mentioned above discloses a folding chair having a single support 
surface in the form of a seat panel. The seat panel is fixedly attached to an 
underlying seat beam. For folding the chair, two metal straps are provided under the 
seat panel at the outer sides of the seat beams. US-A-1 989 865 discloses a chair similar to that of US-A-1 959 046, wherein link 
rods underneath a seat panel are used for folding purposes instead of straps. Additionally known from the prior art documents US-A-2 794 492 and US-A-2 574 
387 are articles of foldable furniture. The latter documents relate to folding chairs having a foldable structure which 
comprises either a sliding pivot joint or a hook type connection of the individual 
elements at at least one location. Thus whilst the chairs can fold into a relatively 
compact shape in their folded-away position, the slide and hook arrangements of 
these types of chairs are prone to jamming, sticking and difficulties with locating the 
elements with respect to each other. This is particularly the case when the chair has  
 
been used many times and the components become worn or dirty, or for example 
where the material of the chair is subject to age variations (e.g. wooden chairs). US-A-1 989 865 and US-A-1 959 046 merely relate to chairs having a single support 
surface with a link member used solely to provide a folding linkage for a single 
upwardly facing seat member. With respect to these prior art documents, the present 
invention relates to providing an improved support surface structure which uses 
elements of the folding structure of the article of furniture. One solution to the problem with sliding joints as encountered with US-A-2 794 492 
and US-A-2 574 387 has been to provide high precision components and high quality 
surface  
 
finishes for the joint assemblies such that the sliding 
movements result in less wear due to low friction. However, 
even with such precision, lubrication is often required on 
the sliding surfaces after much handling, which lubrication 
is unsightly and may cause damage or staining if the chairs 
are made of wood. A further problem which arises with such foldable

<CLAIMS>
Foldable article (1) of furniture, foldable between a 
collapsed position and a folded-out position, said article 

being provided with an upwardly-facing support surface (2), 
upon which surface (2) objects can be placed directly from 

above in said folded-out position, said surface (2) being 
pivotally connected to underlying support leg means (10, 

12), wherein said surface (2) comprises an upwardly-facing 
first section (3) for supporting objects placed thereon 

directly from above, 
characterized in that
, in said folded-out 
position, said upwardly-facing support surface (2) is 

constituted by both said first section (3) and a second 
section (5), in which said second section (5) is also an 

upwardly-facing support surface for supporting objects 
placed thereon directly from above, and in that each of 

said support-surface sections (3, 5) is pivotally connected 
to a respective one of said support leg means (10, 12) and 

to each other.  
 
Foldable article according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the first and second sections (3, 5) are pivotally 
connected to each other at a location (14) remote from 

their respective ends. 
Foldable article according to either of claims 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 there are two underlying support leg 
means (10, 12) connected to each other at a pivot location 

(6). 
Foldable article according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 in that a portion (5a) of 
said second section (5) overlies and is supported on a 

portion (3a) of said first section (3) in the folded-out 
position of the article. 
Foldable article according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
, in the folded-out position, 
the upper surface of the first section (3) and the upper 

surface of the second section (5) are at substantially the 
same level.  

 
Foldable article according to any one of the preceding 
claims
, characterized in that
 said first section, in plan 
view, comprises a substantially U-shaped outer frame. 
Foldable article according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the foldable article has a 
backrest (20) and in that the support surface (2) forms a 

seat portion, said overlying portions (3a, 5a) of said 
first and second sections being positioned at the edge 

remote from the backrest, and in that said first and second 
sections (3, 5) forming said support surface (2) are 

attached to said leg means (10, 12) at respective first and 
second spaced pivot locations (4, 8). 
Foldable article according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 all pivot locations (4, 6, 8, 
10, 14, 22, 24) on the article are substantially fixed with 

respect to said article, so that no sliding pivot locations 
or joints are provided. 
Foldable article according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 a cross brace (16) is 
provided at a location such that it provides support for
