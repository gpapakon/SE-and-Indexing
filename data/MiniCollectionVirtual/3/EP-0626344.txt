<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for controlling the carbon 
balance of a silicon smelting furnace by maintaining the 

concentration of calcium within the silicon formed in the 
furnace within a range of 0.4 to 2.0 weight percent. The 

calcium yield of the furnace is a rapid and sensitive 
indicator of the carbon balance of the furnace. More 

specifically, a calcium yield of less than 80 weight percent 
indicates a negative carbon balance in the furnace; a calcium 

yield of greater than 90 weight percent indicates an excess 
carbon balance in the furnace; and a calcium yield within a 

range of 80 weight percent to 90 weight percent indicates a 
furnace in carbon balance. A preferred embodiment of the 

present invention uses calcium yield in conjunction with a 
harmonic volts parameter and a electrode consumption 

measurement to further control carbon balance of the furnace.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention introduces a method for 
controlling the carbon balance of a silicon smelting furnace. 
We have found that when the concentration of calcium within 
the silicon formed in the furnace is maintained within a 
range of 0.4 to 2.0 weight percent, the calcium yield of the 
furnace is a rapid and sensitive indicator of the carbon 
balance of the furnace. More specifically, a calcium yield 
of less than 80 weight percent indicates a negative carbon 
balance in the furnace; a calcium yield of greater than 90 
weight percent indicates an excess carbon balance in the 
furnace; and a calcium yield within a range of 80 weight 
percent to 90 weight percent indicates a furnace in carbon 
balance. In a preferred embodiment, we use calcium yield in 
conjunction with a harmonic volts parameter andan electrode 
consumption measurement to control carbon balance of the 
furnace. Elemental silicon is produced by the carbothermic 
reduction of silicon dioxide (SiO2) according to the overall 
reaction: 
SiO2 + 2C → Si + 2CO 
Those skilled in the art recognize that this reaction 
proceeds through a number of intermediate reactions involving 
the production and reaction of silicon monoxide (SiO) and 
silicon carbide (SiC). Important intermediate reactions are 
summarized as: The reaction of silicon dioxide with carbon 
to form silicon carbide, 
SiO2 + 3C → SiC + 2CO 
the reaction of silicon monoxide with carbon to form silicon 
carbide,  
 
SiO + 2C → SiC + CO 
and the reaction of silicon with carbon to form silicon 
carbide, 
Si + C → SiCAs equation (1) suggests, a silicon smelting 
furnace is in carbon balance when two moles of carbon are 
added to the furnace per mole of silicon dioxide. This 
condition is described as 100 percent carbon theory. 
However, due to process inefficiencies, operation of a 
silicon smelting furnace does not proceed exclusively 
according to reaction (1). If there is insufficient or unreactive carbon 
present in bulk or locally, reaction (3) is affected and a 
portion of the silicon monoxide will exit the charge bed in 
the offgas. This situation can occur due to raw materials 
selection, bed design and unbalanced stoichiometry in the 
bed. The loss of silicon monoxide from the furnace results 
in reduced recovery of elemental silicon. In addition, in 
the case of insufficient carbon, increased consumption of 
carbon electrodes used in the furnace can occur. In extreme 
cases of carbon deficiency, carbon used as furnace lining may 
also be consumed. Conversely, if too much
