<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and an apparatus for recycling backwater in a papermaking machine. According to the invention backwater draining through a forming fabric is collected into several collecting means (51, 52, 53, 54) and pumped by separate pumps (20) in at least two and preferably numerous separate flows (81 to 85) directly as substantially air free separate flows to the fibre process (12, 30, 40) of the short circulation in order to implement a fast, air free and split recycling of backwater from said forming fabric to said fibre process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for the circulation of
papermaking machine backwater, see for example US-A-4 504 358. Particularly the invention relates to a process,
which provides a fast and exact control of the papermaking process and
which significantly reduces the time needed for changing the paper grade
produced. The process according to the invention especially presents measures
by which the recycling time for backwater is significantly reduced. The apparatus
according to the invention is designed to serve the principle of a controlled
and fast recycling of back water.In a conventional papermaking process the paper stock, prepared in a separate
stock preparation department, goes through the following phases, which constitute
the primary process: after consistency control the stock is fed as a constant
flow to the papermachine approach system, where it is brought close to a
mixing pump, in which it is diluted and mixed to a consistency suitable for
cleaning in centrifugal cleaners; the mixing pump pumps this thin stock to
primary centrifugal cleaners, where debris is separated by means of the centrifugal
force; the accept is brought either directly or via a second mixing pump
to one or more primary pressurized screens, from where it is forwarded to the
papermachine headbox via an appropriate dilution system; the headbox distributes
the diluted stock evenly on an endless forming wire, or in some cases
between two such wires, through which the major part of the water contained
in the thin stock is drained, leaving a consolidated fibre web on the wire, from
which it is transferred to the following phases of paper making, typically pressing
and drying.In the conventional primary fibre process parts of the stock are deviated and
circulated in secondary loops. This is particularly the case with the rejects of
cleaners and screens which, due to a poor selectivity of these devices, contain
good fibres, typically 10 to 30% of the material handled in the primary stage.
Said rejects are diluted in mixing pumps and recovered in secondary cleaning
stages which may be numerous, each handling the reject of a previous stage
and recycling the accepts upstream to a previous stage or into the primary
fibre process. A significant part, typically 5 to 50% of the solids of the thin stock follows the
water drained through the forming wire and is circulated back into the fibre
process with the backwater. In a traditional papermaking process said backwater
passes through backwater pans and
