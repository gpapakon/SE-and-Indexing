<ABSTRACT>
The object was to provide composite articles in which polyesters having a non-impaired processing behaviour and commercially available, unfunctionalised EP(D)M grades are employed. This object is achieved by composite articles in which the hard component is based on a thermoplastic polyester and the soft component is produced by dynamic vulcanisation of a mixture containing the following constituents:     a) from 50 to 95 parts by weight of EP(D)M rubber, b) from 5 to 50 parts by weight of thermoplastic aromatic polyester containing aliphatic double bonds, c) from 0 to 45 parts by weight of unmodified thermoplastic aromatic polyester,   d) from 0 to 100 parts by weight of plasticiser oil,   e) from 0 to 100 parts by weight of reinforcing agent and   f) an effective amount of a crosslinking agent.   The composite articles according to the invention can be produced rapidly; in addition, strong adhesion between the composite partners is achieved.
