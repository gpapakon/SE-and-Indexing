<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high
efficiency salient pole reluctance synchronous motor.As is known, a reluctance synchronous motor
is an electric motor having an induction polarized
rotor, which is started as an asynchronous motor, in
order to operate as a synchronous motor at a rated
operating speed.Such an electric motor, which is very
simple from the construction standpoint, has the
drawback that it has a comparatively low efficiency
and cannot be used for high power applications.Another drawback, moreover, is that the
above mentioned motors, which are driven through
frequency converters, can be used as drives in
adjustable speed systems, but only with loads having a
small moment of inertia because of the difficulties
encountered by said motors for overcoming the
inertial torques generated during the acceleration of
said motors.Such a problem is further compounded as the
motor must be started under load in a direct manner,
that is without providing frequency converters and at
full voltage. In fact, in such a case, the starting time
is very short and, even under a small moment of
inertia load, there are generated inertial torques
which cannot be practically overcome by the motor.The document US-A-1 915 069 discloses a
synchronous motor comprising a rotor with at least two
(actually four) salient poles, each having a pole
surface of a prescribed contour forming with a stator a gap which
increases toward side regions thereof, said rotor
being moreover provided with a cage secondary assembly
comprising bars which are shorted by front rings.The rotor profile taught by this document has
been specifically designed for preventing the locking of
the motor rotor and a slow starting thereof, but not
for increasing the maximum torque of the motor.The document US-A-1 618 771 provides a
synchronous motor in which the gap on the side portions
of the poles presents a step-like variation. This motor
construction has been specifically designed for
reducing to a minimum the angular offset of the rotor
as produced by small variations of the applied voltage
or of the load, with a minimum possible negative effect
on the conditions necessary for a proper starting.The document GB A-914 913 discloses a
synchronous motor actually comprising a centrally
arranged synchronous motor and two asynchronous motors
arranged at the end portions of the overall rotary
body.The document US-A-2 870 352, finally
discloses synchronous motors with rotors which may be
made of solid iron and which may dispense with
squirrel-cage bars, the
