<ABSTRACT>
A method for separating enantiomers of derivatives of aryloxipropanolamines is disclosed. In the method, the derivative is contacted with a chiral solid-phase chromatography material containing molecular imprints of an optically pure enantiomer of the derivative to be separated. A chiral solid-phase chromatography material for use in the method is also disclosed. This material consists of a polymer prepared by polymerisation of a monomer in the presence of a cross-linking agent and of an optically pure enantiomer of the derivative to be separated, a molecular imprint of the optically pure enantiomer being formed in the polymer by non-covalent interactions between the monomer and the optically pure enantiomer. Moreover, there is disclosed the use of the molecular imprinting method for preparing a chiral solid-phase chromatography material for use in the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
separating enantiomers of derivatives of aryloxipropanolamines
and a chiral solid-phase chromatography material
for use in the method. The invention also relates to the
use of the molecular imprinting method for preparing the
chiral solid-phase chromatography material.β-adrenergic blocking compounds (or β-blockers) are
important pharmaceutical preparations which are used in
the treatment of hypertension, arrhythmia and angina
pectoris. There is a great need of using optically pure
enantiomers since the stereoisomers express a varying
pharmacological activity, and in some cases they can also
be used against various symptoms (1). Consequently,
intensive research is in progress for preparing optically
pure β-blockers, e.g. by using an asymmetric synthesis
(2) including biocatalysts (3), a fractional crystallisation
(4), as well as indirect (5) or direct (6) chromatographic
separation of the enantiomorphs.Journal of Chromatography, vol. 516, 1990, 313-322,
relates to the separation of enantiomers of amino acids
such as Cbz-aspartic acid and Cbz-glutamic acid, using
molecular imprinting techniques.Journal of Chromatography, vol. 516, 1990, 323-331;

Chromatography, vol. 470, 1989, 391-399; J. Am. Chem.
Soc. vol. 110, 1988, 5853-5860, relate to optical resolution
of different amide derivatives.Journal of Liquid Chromatography, vol. 13, No. 15,
1990, 2897-3000, relates to optical resolution of alpha-phenylmannoside
and mannose.According to the present invention, a method is
provided for separating enantiomers of derivatives of
aryloxipropanolamines by means of a chiral solid-phase
chromatograpy material (Chiral Stationary Phase = CSP),
which is prepared by the so-called molecular imprinting
method (7). The molecular imprinting method used is based
on non-covalent complementary interactions between the
non-derivatised print molecule and polymerisable monomers.More precisely, a method is provided for separating
enantiomers of derivatives of an aryloxipropanolamine, by
contacting enantiomeric derivatives of aryloxipropanolamine with a chiral solid-phase
chromatography support which contains molecular imprints
of an optically pure enantiomer of the derivatives to be
separated.  Moreover, a polymeric chiral solid-phase chromatography material
is provided to be used in the separation of
enantiomers of derivatives of aryloxipropanolamines, which
material consists of a cross-linked polymer imprinted with
an optically
