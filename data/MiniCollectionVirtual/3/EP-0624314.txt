<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a tunnel-like line passageway which is provided for the use of angling floats. Such tunnel-like line passageway exhibits a baseplate at least on one longitudinal side and has, on the baseplate, a latching pin which is slit in the axial direction. On the baseplate there may be arranged a through-passage hole instead of a fixed latching pin. Located in the longitudinal region of the tunnel-like line passageway is a retaining means with two openings located on one plane.
