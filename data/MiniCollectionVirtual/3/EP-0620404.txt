<ABSTRACT>
A flameholder (36) is disclosed for use in an afterburner (33) of an 
aircraft 

gas turbine engine. The flameholder (36) comprises at least one annular 
ring (40,42) 

and a plurality of open ended slots (68) around the forward end (66) 
of the ring (40,42) with 

the open end (70) of each slot (68) open through the forward edge (66) 
of the ring (40,42) for 

accepting a plurality of fuel spraybars (74). One particular embodiment 
provides two or more sub-pluralities of slots (68) having two or more 

differing 
axial lengths to accommodate different axially spaced sub-pluralities of 

spraybars (74) such as primary and pilot spraybars. A fastening means 
(58) is 

provided for attaching the annular ring (40,42) to the outer engine 
casing (18) and is 

accessible through the exhaust nozzle (39) of the engine. One embodiment 
provides a fastening means (58) with an anti-rotation means on a 

connecting 
link into which a bolt head (60) may be slipped and held from rotating 

during 
torquing of a nut (71). Another feature of the present invention is the 

use of a 
bolt (59) having a thread (57) diameter smaller than the bolt shank (67) 

diameter which 
is particularly useful when the threads (57) are seized due to high 

temperature 
exposure. Overtorqing the nut (71) will fail the bolt (59) at the threads 

(57) facilitating removal of the flameholder (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aircraft gas turbine engine afterburner
flameholder and, more particularly, to a removable flameholder which can
be removed from the rear of the engine through the tailpipe with the
engine installed in the aircraft.It is well known in the aircraft gas turbine engine art to provide
thrust augmentation by burning additional fuel in an afterburner located
downstream of the engine turbine. The afterburner generally includes
means for dispersing a main flow of fuel together with a flameholder to
which the flame may attach. The flameholder locally reduces the velocity
of the gas stream and establishes a recirculation zone within the
afterburner in order to sustain the flame which would otherwise blow out.
The flameholder further provides an ignition zone and a low temperature
rise zone which, in conjunction with fuel injected in parallel and
additionally to a pilot fuel flow, provides staging to accomplish broad
temperature and thrust modulation of the afterburner. One well known
type of flameholder is made of sheetmetal and comprises two concentric
annular flame rings arranged to diverge from each other in a downstream
direction. Fuel may be introduced either uniformly upstream of the
flameholder or in a plurality of locally concentrated zones so that the
afterburning flame is maintained downstream of the trailing edges of the
flame rings.In order to provide for positive and uniform lightoff of the
afterburner during all modes of augmented flight operation, pilot fuel may
be introduced and ignited by means of a point source igniter. The pilot
flame, in turn, operates to ignite the main fuel droplets. It is well known
to introduce the pilot fuel to the afterburner by means of discrete jets 
situated around the flameholder. The pilot fuel jets are generally located
intermediate the flame rings such that each pilot jet receives gas flow from
the turbine exhaust through an inlet to the flameholder.Afterburner flameholders of this type are in
our U.S. Patents Nos. 3,765,178 and 3,931,707.
These afterburner flameholders incude an inner
flame ring and an outer flame ring spaced radially
outwardly from and concentric with the inner flame
ring to form an annular flow passage for receipt
of the turbine exhaust.Modem afterburners such as the one described in the Hufnagle, et
al. patent are made from sheet metal, with elongated slots having closed
semicircular ends that are conventionally referred to as racetrack shaped
holes and have pilot and main spraybars inserted therethrough. The
flameh

<CLAIMS>
A flameholder assembly for use in an
afterburner (33) having spraybars (74) for introducing

fuel into the afterburner (33) of an aircraft gas turbine
engine having an exhaust nozzle (39) aft of the

afterburner (33), said flameholder assembly having
an annular flameholder (36) having a forward end ;


a plurality of open ended slots (68) for receiving
at least one spraybar

, said slots (68) being
circumferentially disposed around

said forward end and a plurality of corresponding open
ends (70) of said slots (68) that are open through a

forward edge of said forward end whereby the flameholder
may be axially removed through the exhaust nozzle without

removal of the spraybars; and,
mounting means including fastening means (58) for
removably attaching the flameholder assembly in the

afterburner, which fastening means (58) are accessible
through the exhaust nozzle (39) of the engine and from

within the flameholder.
A flameholder assembly as claimed in claim 1
wherein said mounting means comprises a plurality of

rotatable retaining links (50) connected to said
flameholder (36) by said fastening means (58) and said

each of said fastening means (58) comprises;

a bolt (59) having a bolt head (60) and said bolt
(59) being disposed through a first aperture (51) in a

member of said link (50),
an anti-rotation means (56) disposed about said
first aperture (51)
said bolt (59) being secured to said flameholder by
a nut (71)
one of said bolt head (60) and said nut (71) being
anti-rotationally engaged by said anti-rotation means

(56), and
the other of said bolt head (60) and said nut (71)
being accessible from interior of said flameholder.
A flameholder assembly as claimed in claim 2
wherein said bolt (59) comprises a shank (67) having said

bolt head (60) at a proximal end and threaded portion
(57) at a distal end and an unthreaded portion

therebetween,

said threaded portion (57) being engaged by threads
of said nut (71) and having a first diameter, and
said unthreaded portion having a second diameter,
wherein said first diameter is sufficiently smaller
than said second diameter so as to preferentially

fracture said threaded portion with said nut (71) during
overtorquing of said fastening means (58).

wherein said annular flame holder comprises:


two radially spaced apart annular inner and outer
flame rings (40,42) having a circumferentially disposed

plurality of radially extending sleeves (61) radially
