<ABSTRACT>
Provided herein is an ultrasonic motor in 
which at least fluorocarbon resin and whisker-shaped 

powder is present on the contact surface of the rotor. 
Since the fluorocarbon polymer provides a smooth contact 

surface, the ultrasonic motor generates no noise and 
produces a stable starting torque and holding torque. 

In addition, it has a long life with a minimum of wear.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic motor 
which is so designed as to produce a driving force by the 
aid of traveling waves of ultrasonic frequency vibration 
generated by piezoelectric elements. An ultrasonic motor driven by traveling waves, as 
disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,562,373, is 
made up of a flat piezoelectric element, a flat stator to 
which is attached said piezoelectric element, a rotor 
which is in contact under pressure with said stator, and a 
friction material interposed between said stator and said 
rotor. To run the motor, an electric power of ultrasonic 
frequency is applied to the piezoelectric element, with 
the time difference and phase difference properly 
controlled. The applied electric power generates transverse 
traveling waves in synchronism with the ultrasonic 
vibration in the thickness direction of the piezoelectric 
element and stator. The wave crests of the traveling 
waves drive the rotor forward through the friction material.  
 The ultrasonic motor of traveling wave type will be 
described with reference to Fig. 5. There are shown a 
piezoelectric element 1, a stator 2 which is bonded and 
fixed to the piezoelectric element 1, a rotor 3 placed on 
the stator 2, and a friction material 4 firmly attached to 
the rotor 3. When energized, the piezoelectric element 1 
generates traveling waves of ultrasonic frequency which 
propagate in the direction of arrow A in the stator 2. 
The vibration causes each particle of the stator 2 to move 
along the elliptic orbit indicated by arrow B. The wave 
crest of the traveling wave advances horizontally in the 
direction opposite to that of the traveling wave, and the 
wave trough of the traveling wave advances horizontally in 
the same direction as the traveling wave. Therefore, the 
rotor 3 placed on the stator 2 is in contact with the wave 
crests only and is driven horizontally in the direction of 
arrow C by frictional force generated between the rotor 3 
and the stator 2. An important factor in the ultrasonic motor of such 
structure is how the rotor is in contact under pressure 
with the stator. It greatly affects the starting torque, 
no-load speed, motor efficiency, and motor life. Heretofore, 
much has been studied on increasing friction between 
the rotor and the stator. To this end, a variety of materials 
have been investigated. For example, there was  
 
proposed a method of increasing friction by attaching a 
metallic material or rubber having a high coefficient of 
friction to the rotor and
