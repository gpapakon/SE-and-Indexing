<ABSTRACT>
A tether retention system for an airbag module 
cover (22) includes a channel (24) formed in the side of a 

reaction canister (12). One end of the tether (30) 
includes a loop (38) which is inserted into the channel 

(24) through a slot (26). A solid rod (40) is inserted 
into the channel (24) and through the loop (38) to anchor 

it in place. The other end of the tether (30) includes a 
further loop (32) which accommodates a metal bar (34) and 

is connected to the cover (22) by rivets (36). The rod 
(40) is restrained against longitudinal movement by 

reaction can end plates (14, 16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of motor vehicle
airbag systems. More specifically, it relates to means for
tethering the cover of a passenger side airbag module.Passenger side airbag modules are normally positioned
behind the instrument panel of a motor vehicle. The module
comprises a reaction canister which houses a cylindrical inflator
and a folded airbag. A breakaway portion of the instrument panel
forms the cover of the airbag module. Upon inflation, the airbag
rapidly expands, breaking away the module cover portion of the
instrument panel to provide a protective cushion for the
passenger.It is customary to provide some type of tether on the
module cover to prevent it from flying into the vehicle. Because
of flexibility and availability of material, it would be
desirable to employ fabric tethers for these applications.
However, this has created problems in the past due to the fact
that the end of the tether secured to the reaction canister has
a finite number of attachment points. The attachment points
might be, for example, rivets. Point loading at the attachment 
points tends to cause the fabric tether to fail. The
problem has been to provide a tether with adequate strength
to withstand the force of propelling the cover.An existing airbag module cover door restraining
arrangement is described in EP-A-0 465 869 (on which the
pre-characterising part of claim 1 is based). The module
door is retained by a tether one end of which is connected
to the door and the other end of which is looped over a
member connected to a module support structure.A further airbag module cover door restraining
arrangement is described in US 4,852,907. The cover
includes two doors and a substrate member connected to a
module housing by rivets. The cover includes flexible belts
which are cast in the door cover and extend from the doors
into a surrounding portion of the cover. Retaining rods are
located in discontinuous channels in the substrate member
and one end of each belt passes through a discontinuity in
one of the channels and around the rod accommodated in the
channel.Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present
invention to provide a fabric tether restraint wherein the
force of deployment is evenly spread along the tether width.
Other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent
from the following description and appended claims.In accordance with the present invention, one end of a
wide fabric tether is securely fastened to the airbag module
cover. The other end of the tether is formed into a

<CLAIMS>
An airbag module for use in a motor vehicle
including a reaction canister (12) housing an airbag (20)

and an airbag inflator (18), a module cover (22)
displaceable by said airbag (20) upon inflation, a tether

(30) having first and second ends, the first end being
secured to said module cover (22) and the second end forming

a loop (38) and retaining means in a fixed position in said
motor vehicle including means extending through said loop

(38) to anchor said tether (30) during displacement of said

module cover (22), characterised in that said retaining
means comprises a retainer rod (40) extending through said

loop (38) and means for securing said retainer rod (40) in
said fixed position comprising a channel (24) on said

reaction canister (12) enclosing said retainer rod (40) and
loop (38) therein.
The module according to claim 1 wherein said
securing means additionally comprises at least one end plate

(14, 16) on said reaction canister (12) blocking an end of
said channel (24).
The module according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said
tether (30) is fabric.
The module according to claim 3 wherein said tether
(30) is a single ply fabric folded upon itself to form a

double ply main body with a loop (32, 38) at each end.
The module as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein said tether (30) is a single ply material folded 

upon itself to form a double ply main body with a loop (32,
38) at each end.
The module according to any preceding claim wherein
said channel (24) extends along the length of said reaction

canister (12).
The module according to claim 6 wherein said tether
(30) has a width substantially equal to the length of said

reaction canister (12).
The module according to any preceding claim wherein
said tether (30) extends within said channel (24) through a

slot opening (26) formed therein.
The module according to claim 8 wherein said
retainer rod (40) is sized greater than said slot opening

(26).
The module according to any preceding claim
wherein said reaction canister (12) is composed of extruded

aluminium with said channel (24) formed thereon.
The module according to any preceding claim
wherein said channel (24) and said retainer rod (40) are

each of a generally cylindrical shape.
