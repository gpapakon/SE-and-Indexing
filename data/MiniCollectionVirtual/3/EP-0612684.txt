<ABSTRACT>
The aforementioned invention relates to a bottle opener for levering off crown caps having a handle body (2) on which there is arranged a lever edge (12) for gripping beneath the crimped flange of the crown cap (4),  the handle body (2) being disk like and having an inner shaft (3) to accommodate the crown cap to be levered off, with there being formed in each case between the shaft and the upper edge (5) and the lower edge (6) of the handle body a web (7, 8), which webs (7, 8) are in each case at least partly penetrated by a bore (9, 10) which leads into each shaft and the web (7) which is arranged in the region of the upper edge (5) taking the form of a supporting edge and the web (8) arranged in the region of the lower edge (6) taking the form of a lever edge (12) for removing crown caps, the bore (9) in the region of the upper edge having a smaller diameter and the bore (10) in the region of the lower edge having a larger diameter than that of the crown caps.

Bottle opener for levering off crown cork closures, with a 
disc-shaped hand-grip, on which a lever edge for gripping 

under the corrugated edge of the crown cork is arranged, 
the hand-grip having a shaft to receive the crown cork and 

holes traversing the hand-grip coaxially with the shaft,
 
characterised in that
 
the inner shaft (3) and top edge (5) as well as the bottom 

edge (6) of the hand-grip (2) form projections (7,8), which 
are at least partially traversed by the holes (9,10) 

leading into the shaft (3), the projection arranged in the 
area of the top edge (5) forms a supporting edge (11) and 

the projection (8) in the area of the bottom edge (6) a 
lever edge (12) for the crown cork (4), the hole (9) in the 

area of the top edge (5) having a smaller diameter and the 
hole (10) in the area of the bottom edge (6) a larger 

diameter than the crown cork (4), said holes being 
dimensioned in such a wa
y that the crown cork (4) can be 
received approximately coaxially in the shaft (3) and is 

movable within the latter, the height (h) of the shaft 
being only slightly greater than the height "h'" of the 

crown cork (4), so that the pressure point (20) of the 
hand-grip (2) applied to the crown cork (4) is positioned 

near the centre of the crown cork (4).
