<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotor for a 
dynamo electric machine in which materials for portions 
on the rotor such as wedges where an eddy current flows 
are improved. Iron or aluminum alloy is generally used for wedges 
which press field windings of a rotor for an electric 
generator used in an electric power generating plant 
using a gas turbine or a steam turbine as its prime 
mover. In response to increasing electric power demands 
large capacity electric power generation plants are these 
days being constructed. In association therewith likely 
large starting devices are necessitated which are 
designed to start gas turbine or combined cycle power 
generation plants and a thyristor type starting system 
has been drawing an attention, in which during starting a 
power generation plant a synchronous generator in the 
power generation plant is operated as a variable speed 
motor and a gas turbine in the electric power generation 
plant is accelerated upto a predetermined speed from  
 
where a self speed up is possible by a torque generated 
by the variable speed motor. A rotating speed of a synchronous motor varies 
depending on frequencies of an AC power source applied to 
the armature windings thereof. Therefore, an AC power 
source of variable frequency is necessitated for 
operating a synchronous generator in variable speed, and 
the frequency thereof has to be adapted to be controlled 
dependent on the rotating speed of the variable speed 
motor. For the purpose of obtaining such AC power source 
of variable frequency a frequency converter device using 
semiconductor elements such as thyristors is made use of. A frequency converter device is composed by a 
forward converting unit in which an AC is converted into 
a DC and a backward converting unit in which a DC is 
converted into an AC. When starting an electric power 
generation plant by making use of such frequency 
converter device, a rectangular shaped current is flowed 
through the armature windings of the electric generator. 
The rectangular shaped current contains higher harmonic 
current components as expressed by the following 
equations ; 
Frequencies of higher harmonic waves : fi=(6i ± 1)foMagnitudes of higher harmonic waves : Ai=Ao/(6i ± 1) 
wherein, 
   i=1, 2, 3, ···    fo=frequency of fundamental wave    Ao=magnitude of fundamental wave The higher harmonic current components flowing 
through the armature windings induce eddy currents on the 
surface of the rotor. Eddy current flowing through a 
wedge moves to teeth
