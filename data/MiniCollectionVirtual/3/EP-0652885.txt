<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a new polyazamacrocyclic compound or a salt thereof and its uses as a tissue specific chelator. The compound has formula (I), where x is 2, 3 or a combination of p 2(s) and q 3(s) where p + q = y; y is 3 or 4; R is (CH2)ZP(=O)OR1OR2; R1 is H or CH3; R2 is CnH1+2n; n is 4 to 6; z is 1 to 3. In one important embodiment, this compound may be complexed with a metal to be a plyazamacrocyclic compound-metal complex having formula (II), where r is 2 or 3; and M is a metal ion, including a lanthanide, a heavy metal, or a radionuclide metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions and
methods for enhancing contrast in imaging internal
structures and functions of living subjects.Imaging of internal structures and functions of
living subjects may be accomplished by applying
electromagnetic radiation from external sources (as in
conventional x-rays and computerized axial tomography) or
internal sources (as in PET or positron emission
tomography and radionuclide scans). Use of ionizing
radiation is avoided in imaging with nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) and ultrasonography, making these methods
advantageous for many applications.Whatever the imaging modality, consideration is
given to means of increasing image contrast through
localization of contrast agents in the region to be
imaged. Such agents are frequently metals which emit,
absorb, or scatter energy or, as in the case with NMR
agents, increase the image signal strength locally. For
best effect, agents must be localized. This may be
accomplished, for example, by direct injection of
contrast agent (as in myelograms or retrograde
urethrograms), through metabolic uptake of an agent (as
in PET), and by conjugation of contrast agents with
monoclonal antibodies which tend to accumulate in certain
tissues. The latter process in particular has been used 
in NMR image enhancement with chelated metal ions. Though
well known, the process has several shortcomings:
1 - preparation of the antibody is complex;2 - diminished immunoreactivity of the antibody
occurs following conjugation;3 - there is limited uptake of the conjugate by the
target tissue; and4 - there may be unfavorable interactions between
the chelated ion and the antibody.Because of the advantages of NMR imaging (good
resolution and avoidance of ionizing radiation), an NMR
contrast agent capable of greater localization would be
clinically important. Such an agent would offer
significant advantages over contrast agents of the prior
art.The quality of the images obtained from an NMR scan
is based on two properties: the proton densities of the
various tissues and differences in proton relaxation
rates. The proton density of tissues cannot be readily
altered. Proton relaxation rates can be adjusted by
adding a paramagnetic relaxation agent, more commonly
known as a "contrast agent." Contrast agents enhance the
contrast in NMR images between magnetically similar but
histologically dissimilar tissues.Gadoliniun, which has strong paramagnetic properties
because of its seven unpaired electrons, has been tested
as a contrast agent. It has a
