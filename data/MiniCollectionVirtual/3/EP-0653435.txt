<ABSTRACT>
An improved process suitable for large-scale production of 2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine 
(d4T) and close analogs is disclosed. The 

improved process yields d4T in high yield and purity without the use of 
hazardous reactions or reagents and incorporates several process 

improvements important on a large scale including a novel purification 
step involving the isolation of a d4T·N-methylpyrrolidinone solvate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an improved process for 
producing 2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine 
(d4T) that is suitable for adaptation to 
large-scale manufacture. There have been several processes reported for synthesizing 
2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxynucleosides such as d4T. Most proceed via 
an anhydronucleosidic intermediate. The nucleoside derivative, 2'3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine 
(d4T), has previously been prepared by various synthetic processes. 
Horwitz et al, in Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry (Vol.1), 
Zorbach et al (eds); Interscience, New York, p. 344, describe the process 
of Route 1 (below), which utilizes 3',5'-anhydrothymidine as the starting 
material, and employs flammable and moisture sensitive potassium 
tertiary butoxide (KOt-Bu) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Besides the 
material handling difficulties, the process is impractical on a large scale 
due to decomposition of the product during its isolation from a DMSO 
solution, when it is subjected to the required high temperatures and 
strongly basic conditions for extended periods.  
 
An improvement in isolation noted by Mansuri et a in J. Med. 
Chem.,1989, 461 (Route 2), gives the potassium salt of d4T as an oily 
solid by dilution of the DMSO reaction mixture with toluene before further 
processing. However, on a large scale, the volumes used are 
unmanageable and generate large amounts of waste solvents, which 
are difficult to recover. Also, the isolated salt is very sensitive to moisture 
and excessive drying. After redissolution and neutralization, crude d4T 
is isolated and dried and a further reslurry in solvent is necessary to 
obtain the final product. 
Starrett, Jr. et al in U.S. 4,904,770 disclosed modification of the 
Mansuri process that comprised room temperature reaction of the 3',5' 
anhydro intermediate with the strong base in a polar organic solvent, 
e.g. KOt-Bu/DMSO followed by trituration of the resulting potassium salt 
of the 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxynucleoside in an organic solvent, e.g. 
cold toluene. After redissolution and neutralization, crude d4T is 
obtained by acetone extraction of the solids isolated from the 
neutralization process. A different approach to minimizing the product decomposition 
problem involved replacement of the KOt-Bu/DMSO system.  
 This variation (Route 3), using hexamethylphosphoric triamide 
(HMPA) and sodium hydroxide, eliminated the decomposition problems 
in the above Routes 1 and 2, since the HMPA solvent could be removed 
from an aqueous
