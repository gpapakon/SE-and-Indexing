<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
Escherichia coli peptidyl prolyl-cis·trans isomerase-β 
and genes coding for the same. Peptidyl prolyl-cis.trans isomerase (PPIase) 
accelerates protein folding reaction by catalyzing the 
isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds in the protein. 
It is useful as means for activating an inactive protein 
produced by genetic engineering and as a reagent for 
enzymological analysis. Its corresponding gene coding 
is useful for the production of the enzyme by genetic 
engineering, and is also expected to be used as starting 
material for the gene which allows for the production by 
genetic engineering of the enzyme derivatives in which 
the enzymatic activity, intracellular localizability, 
substrate specificity and stability thereof have been 
altered. The present application further describes 
means for efficient production of a useful protein with 
a correct conformation by expressing the above-mentioned 
gene in the same cells as that in which other gene 
coding for the useful protein is expressed. PPIase was found in the porcine kidneys 
[Fisher, G., Bang, H. & Mech, C. Biomed. Biochim. 
Acta,43, 1101-1111 (1984)], is known to have the 
enzymatic activity of isomerizing Xaa-Pro bond (wherein 
Xaa stands for any amino acid and Pro for L-proline) 
[Fisher, G., Bang, H & Mech, C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta, 
43, 1101-1111 (1984)] and accelerate protein folding 
reaction of some denatured proteins such as 
immunoglobulin L chain and ribonuclease T1 [Lang, K., 
Schmid, F. & Fisher, G, Nature329, 268-270 (1987)]. 
The amino acid sequence of the enzyme purified from 
porcine kidneys was shown to  
 
be identical with that of Cyclophilin, a protein known 
to bind to an immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporine A 
(CsA) which has found to inhibit the PPIase activity. 
Since the immunosuppressive activity is directly 
proportional to the binding ability of CsA derivatives 
to cyclophilin, which represents the most of the 
CsA-binding activity in lymphoid cells, it is inferred 
that the action of CsA, for example, immunosuppressing 
action in T-cells, is mediated through the inhibition of 
the PPIase activity [Takahashi, N., Hayano, E. & Suzuki, 
M. Nature337, 473-475 (1989)]. The CsA binding and the 
PPIase activities were found in almost all organs and in 
nearly all species. However it is not known how CsA 
acts specifically on immune system, particularly on T 
cells, during an organ transplantation, has not been 
explained. Rhodopsin, a visual pigment occurring in animal 
retinas,
