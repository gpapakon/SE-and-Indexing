<ABSTRACT>
A secondary mechanical seal assembly is used on a shaft (12) that is rotatable within a housing (14) to seal both gaseous and liquid medium (20). The assembly (18) includes a stationary seal face element (26) that is fixed relative to the housing and a rotating seal face element (24) that is fixed relative to the shaft (12). One of the seal face element (24-26) back surfaces (34) includes at least one slot (40) configured to produce a wave on the front surface (32) of the seal face element (24-26) when the shaft (12) is rotated. The wave creates an opening force that is sufficient to control wear and prolong seal life when the secondary seal assembly (18) is exposed to a gaseous medium. When exposed to a pressurized liquid medium, the hydrodynamic loading from the liquid medium alters the seal face element (24-26) waviness, and increases the closing force due to the action of the pressurized liquid on the back surface of the seal face elements, such that excessive leakage is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SECONDARY GAS/LIQUID MECHANICAL SEAL ASSEMBLYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to mechanical seal assemblies and, more particularly, to secondary mechanical seal assemblies that can seal a gas and also a liquid.2. Description of the Related ArtA mechanical seal assembly seals a shaft that is rotatable within a housing and includes a pair of opposed seal face elements, one stationary seal face element that does not rotate relative to the housing and one rotating seal face element that rotates with the shaft. One of these seal face elements is free to move axially toward the other one. Such seal assemblies, for example, can be used in pump systems to seal the pump shaft against either a liquid medium or a gaseous medium to substantially prevent the medium from flowing along the shaft and out the housing to the atmosphere. The seal face elements are pressed together at their opposing front surfaces by a closing force, which typically is supplied by one or more axially-oriented springs and the pressure of the sealed medium on the back side of the seal face elements.In general, mechanical seal assemblies that are used to seal a liquid medium have seal face elements with opposing surfaces that are flat. The opposing surfaces do not actually come in contact with each other because the liquid medium has sufficient pressure to push the seal face elements slightly apart, providing an opening force. The opening force allows a thin film of the liquid medium to. act as a lubricating film between the seal surfaces, on 

 the order of a few microns, that prolongs seal life and reduces seal wear. In general, mechanical seal assemblies that are used to seal a gaseous medium have seal face elements with opposing surfaces that are provided with stepped pads or spiral grooves. Because a gaseous medium provides less efficient lubrication than a liquid medium, the stepped pads or spiral grooves are needed to create surface deformities that generate a sufficient opening force to push apart the seal face elements. The seal face elements are thereby kept apart, which prolongs seal life and reduces seal wear.In critical operations, or applications where a volatile medium is involved, it is often necessary to provide a redundant sealing system that will prevent the medium from flowing to the atmosphere, contain a leak, and meet safety requirements for stable operation of the system. A redundant sealing system includes a primary seal assembly that seals the system medium from
