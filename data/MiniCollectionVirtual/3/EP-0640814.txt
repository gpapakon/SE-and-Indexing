<ABSTRACT>
A combinational weighing or counting apparatus designed 
to increase the probability of selection of combinations. This 

combinational weighing or counting apparatus includes a plurality of 
weighing hoppers (6
i
), and a plurality of driving feeders (3
i
) for 
supplying articles (M) from an upstream side towards the 

corresponding weighing hoppers (6
i
) when the driving feeders (3
i
) are 
driven. In this combinational weighing or counting apparatus, the value 

at which the probability of occurrence of the combinational calculated 
weight or count, attains a maximum value is chosen to be greater than 

the target combined weight T
M
, but falling within an allowance of an 
lower limit T
MIN
 to an upper limit T
MAX
 of the target combined weight 
T

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combinational weighing
or counting methods and apparatus therefor which utilize a plurality
of weighing devices for weighing or counting a plurality of articles of
varying weight such as, for example, snacks, candies, fruits or vegetables
or small machine parts, and then to select an appropriate
combination of the articles based on results of weight measurements
or counts.The combinational weighing apparatus is a machine so
designed that the articles of varying weight such as snacks, candies,
fruits or vegetables can be averaged or substantially matched in weight
to a target combined weight. An example of this combinational
weighing apparatus is well known and is disclosed in, for example, the
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 63-30725 published in 1988,
and will now be discussed with reference to Fig. 6.Referring to Fig. 6, articles M to be weighed which have
been transported by means of a transport conveyor 1 are dispensed
through a dispensing feeder 2 into a plurality of vibratory feeders or
driving feeders 31 to 3n which subsequently loads fractions of the
articles into respective weighing hoppers 61 to 6n. A combination control
means (not shown) selects some of the weighing hoppers 61 to 6n
to thereby select an appropriate combination of the weighing hoppers
61 to 6n. In other words, based on the weights given by the respective
weighing hoppers 61 to 6n, the combination control means selects the
appropriate combination of the weighing hoppers 61 to 6n which would 
eventually provides a measured combined weight equal or generally
equal to a target combined weight. The respective fractions of the
articles M accommodated within the selected appropriate combination
of the weighing hoppers 61 to 6n are then discharged into a collecting
and discharging chute 9.According to the prior art, in order to accomplish the selection
of the appropriate combination as precisely and as efficiently as
possible, arrangement has hitherto been made that the amount of the
articles M to be supplied into each of the weighing hoppers 61 to 6n is
equal or approximately equal to a target supply weight T (for example,
the quotient of the target combined weight TM divided by the number
m of the weighing hoppers selected for the combination) to which the
articles are supplied into the respective weighing hoppers 61 to 6n. For
this purpose, parameters for controlling a supply ability of each of the
driving feeders 31 to 3n (such as representative of the amplitude of
vibration to which

A combinational weighing or counting method which
comprises the steps of:


supplying from an upstream side articles to a
plurality of weighing hoppers by driving a corresponding

number of driving feeders;
selecting as a combination selected value, one of
combinational calculated values which are obtained by

combining measured values of the articles supplied into the
weighing hoppers, which one is of a value equal to a target

combined value or within an allowance thereof; and
controlling a supply ability of each of the driving
feeders on the basis of target supply values to which the

articles are to be supplied to the respective weighing
hoppers so that the value, at which a probability of

occurrence of the combinational calculated value is
maximum, is greater than the target combined value, but

falls within the allowance.
