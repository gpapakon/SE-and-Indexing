<ABSTRACT>
A demountable peristaltic pump block combination for use 
in a photoactivatable agent patient treatment system 

wherein photoactivatable agents, while in contact with 
patient blood cells, are pumped through an irradiation 

chamber associated with the pump block (201) and irradiated 
extracorporeally before being returned to the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of treating cells with 
photoactivatable compounds and radiation which activates 
the compound thereby affecting the cells and specifically, 
relates to clinically useful systems for the 
extracorporeal treatment of blood cells, and more 
particularly to radiation chamber pump blocks and a 
demountable peristaltic pump therefor. It is well-known that a number of human disease states may 
be characterized by the overproduction of certain types of 
leukocytes, including lymphocytes, in comparison to other 
populations of cells which normally comprise whole blood. 
Excessive or abnormal lymphocyte populations result in 
numerous adverse effects to patients including the 
functional impairment of bodily organs, leukocyte mediated 
autoimmune diseases and leukemia related disorders many of 
which often ultimately result in fatality. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,321,919; 4,398,906; 4,428,744; and 
4,464,166 to Edelson describe methods for treating blood 
whereby the operation or viability of certain cellular 
populations may be moderated thereby providing relief for 
these patients. In general, the methods comprise treating 
the blood with a dissolved photoactivatable drug, such as  
 
psoralen, which is capable of forming photoadducts with 
DNA in the presence of U.V. radiation. It is believed 
that covalent bonding results between the psoralen and the 
lymphocyte nucleic acid thereby effecting metabolic 
inhibition of the thusly treated cells. Following 
extracorporeal radiation, the cells are returned to the 
patient where they are thought to be cleared by natural 
processes but at an accelerated pace believed attributable 
to disruption of membrane integrity, alteration of DNA 
within the cell, or the like conditions often associated 
with substantial loss of cellular effectiveness or 
viability. Although a number of photoactivatable compounds in the 
psoralen class are known, 8-methoxy psoralen is presently 
the compound of choice. An effective radiation for this 
compound, and many psoralens in general, is the 
ultraviolet spectrum in the range of approximately 320 to 
400 nanometers, alternatively referred to as the U.V.A. 
spectrum. As the development of photoactivatable 
compounds proceeds, it may be expected that changes in the 
preferred activation radiation spectrum will be necessary. 
Suitable selection of radiation sources will, of course, 
increase treatment efficiency and is contemplated as an 
obvious optimization procedure for use with the inventions 
disclosed

<CLAIMS>
1. In a patient treatment system wherein patient fluids, 
in contact with a photoactivatable agent, are irradiated 

extracorporeally in an irradiation chamber for 
photoactivating the photoactivatable agent, and returning 

said treated cells to the patient, a combination 
comprising a peristaltic roller pump having three or more 

rollers, a pump block associated with said irradiation 
chamber having hollow tubing in fluid communication with 

said irradiation chamber, said pump block further 
comprising an arcuate track having an angle  satisfying 

the following formula: 
180 ≧  ≧ 360/n where n is the number of rollers 

associated with said peristaltic roller pump, said hollow 
tubing following the contour of said arcuate track, said 

pump block adapted to slidably engage said peristaltic 
roller pump whereby upon engagement, said hollow tubing is 

occluded by at least one roller. 
2. The combination as provided in Claim 1 wherein said 
peristaltic roller pump comprises a pump with three 

rollers, said rollers mounted on arms, one end of which 
are pivotably mounted on said peristaltic roller pump, and 

the other end of said arms being urged outward from the 
center of said peristaltic pump by resilient means 

associated with said pump. 
3. The combination as set forth in Claim 2 further 
comprising travel limiting means associated with the end 

of said pump having said resilient means for limiting the 
outward movement of said arm and said roller. 
4. The combination of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said 
peristaltic roller pump further comprises alignment means 

for facilitating engagement of said rollers of said 
peristaltic roller pump with said arcuate track of said 

pump block upon sliding engagement therebetween.
