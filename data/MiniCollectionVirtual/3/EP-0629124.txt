<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for determining an individual's ability to become tanned or to stand exposure to ultraviolet radiation without causing a skin reaction, such as skin cancer or erythema. According to the method, at least part of said individual's skin surface is exposed to electromagnetic radiation of first and second wavelengths and of predetermined intensities. The first and second wavelengths at which erythrodermic skin reflection is high and low, respectively. The intensity of electromagnetic radiation reflected from the individual's skin surface is measured so as to determine first and second coefficients of reflection of said first and second wavelengths, respectively. The first and second coefficients are compared to sets of coefficients of reflection representing coherent sets of coefficients of reflection of specific states of redness, and the first and second coefficients of reflection are corrected into a set of corrected first and second coefficients of reflection of a specific state of redness. The corrected first coefficient of reflection is further converted into a measure representing the individual's ability to become tanned or to stand exposure to ultraviolet radiation without causing said skin reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the technique of determining an
individual's ability to become tanned or to stand exposure to ultraviolet
radiation without causing a skin reaction, such as skin cancer or
erythema, which technique is described in US Patent No. 4.882.598, to
which US Patent reference is made.According to the technique described in the above US Patent, the
individual's ability to become tanned or to stand exposure to ultraviolet
radiation without causing a skin reaction may be determined by exposing
a skin surface part of the individual to electromagnetic radiation,
e.g. visible light, and determining the coefficient of reflection
of the individual's skin surface part to the electromagnetic radiation
and converting the coefficient of reflection to a measure representing
the individual's ability to become tanned or to stand exposure to ultraviolet
radiation. The technique described in the above US Patent is
based on clinical experiments revealing a linear relationship between a
number of individuals coefficients of skin surface reflection in logarithmic
representation and the same individuals' ability to stand exposure
to ultraviolet radiation of a predetermined intensity and of a predetermined
spectral composition. According to the above-mentioned US Patent,
individuals who are erythrodermic or erythematous may further be
identified by performing the determination of the individuals' coefficient
of reflection to electromagnetic radiation at two distinct wavelengths,
one of which is a wavelength at which erythrodermic skin reflection
is high, and another one of which is a wavelength at which
erythrodermic skin reflection is low.The basis of the present invention is the realization that the determination
of the individual's coefficient of reflection or reflections
to electromagnetic radiation is to a high degree influenced by the blood
flow of the individual at the site or the skin surface part at which the
measurement is carried out. An obvious solution solving the problem of
eliminating the blood flow influence on the determination of the measure
representing the individual's ability to become tanned or to stand exposure
to ultraviolet radiation in accordance with the teaching of the
above US Patent is to specify a "normal" measuring routine involving
that the individual is kept in a normalized position and state, e.g. 
specifying the site or the part of the individual's skin surface at
which the measurement is to be performed, the position of the site or
skin surface part in question,
