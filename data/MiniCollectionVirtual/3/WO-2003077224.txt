 METHODANDAPPARATUSFORREDUCINGFALSETAWS WARNINGSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to avionics, and more particularly to Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS) and navigational systems.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A conventional altitude display for a terrain awareness system for a given aircraft provides a pilot with a visual display of the terrain having an altitude higher than the aircraft, as well as the terrain within some distance (e.g. 2000') below an aircraft. If it appears that the aircraft is going to hit or travel relatively close to terrain, various alerts and warnings are generated. See, e. g. , U.S. Patent 6,138,060 to Conner et al . As used herein, warnings relate to more threatening conditions than alerts. Each may include audible, visual or other type of indications to a user. One problem with conventional systems is false or nuisance alerts and warnings may be generated as the aircraft is preparing to land at a runway. That is, as the aircraft descends it will naturally appear to be headed towards terrain (the runway) , and nuisance alerts and warnings may be generated. Furthermore, the terrain may still be displayed on the aviation display unit. As 

a result, the screen may be cluttered with non- threatening terrain data during landing.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention, in certain embodiments, overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art noted above. In one aspect, the invention is directed to a system for reducing nuisance alerts and warnings in a terrain awareness and warning system for an aircraft, including determining if the aircraft is within a predetermined geometric volume surrounding an airport. If the aircraft is within the geometric volume, then determining the aircraft's current projected flight path for a selected distance or time and comparing it with at least one approach volume extending from a runway at the airport towards an outer boundary of the geometric volume. If the aircraft's current projected flight path is such that the aircraft is expected to be within the approach volume and stay within the approach volume to the runway, then inhibiting selected alerts and warnings associated with non-threatening terrain.In another aspect, the invention is directed to a terrain awareness and warning system for an aircraft comprising a display apparatus which displays terrain within a predetermined look-ahead region based on the aircraft's current projected flight path and generates alerts and warnings for terrain in or proximate to the
