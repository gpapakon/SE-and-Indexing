<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a chimney base (10) with a liquid discharge for a chimney having an outer casing (12) and an inner pipe (14), in which there is a support with an aperture for liquid for the inner pipe (14) at the lower end section (18) of the chimney. In order to provide a chimney base (19) in which a secure connection between a container (29) and a liquid discharge aperture is ensured while additional space for the container is not necessary, it is proposed that the outer casing (12) have blocks, that there be a container (20) in the form of a neutralisation vessel to receive liquid inside the lower end section (18) of the chimney base (10), that the lower end section (18) of the chimney base (10) have a lateral aperture (22) for the introduction of the container (20) into the inner chamber (16) and that the discharge (28) for liquid be connected to the container (20) via a pipe (30) preferably arranged in the inner chamber (16) which can be hydrostatically closed against the ingress of unwanted air or flue gas, preferably by a siphon (32) fitted in the pipe (30). Supports (40, 42) may be provided on the side walls of the inner chamber (16) to engage with projections (36, 38) provided on the sides of the container (20) preferably in the region of its upper end so that the container (20) may be slid like a drawer into the inner chamber (16) of the lower end section (18) of the chimney base (10). The lower end section (18) of the chimney base (10) may be made of casing blocks (21, 47, 49) which, together with the support (24), may be joined together into one unit by tie rods (52).

in its inner chamber (16) and a lateral aperture (22)

for placing the container (20) into the inner chamber
(16),
the casing blocks (21, 47, 49) and the support (24)
being joined together into a unit by tie rods (52),

the support (24) showing an outlet or passage (28)
for liquids and a pipe (30) which can be closed

against the ingress of secondary air, e.g. flue gas,
connecting the passage (28) with the container (20).

characterized therein
 that

the lower end section (18) of the chimney base (10)
shows a base to receive a condensation pump.
Chimney base according to one of the claims 1 or 2,
characterized therein
 that

above the support (24) in the inner pipe (14) and in
the outer casing (12) an aperture for cleaning (46)

is provided for.
Chimney base according to claim 3,
characterized therein
 that

above the aperture for cleaning (46) in the outer
casing (12) an aperture for aeration (48) is provided 

for.
Chimney base according to claim 3 or 4,
characterized therein
 that

the aperture (22), the aperture for cleaning (46) and
if necessary the aperture for aeration (48) are

arranged above each other in the same wall of the
outer casing (12) and that their borderings are

provided with one common lining.
Chimney base according to claim 1,
characterized therein
 that

the pipe (30) can be closed by a siphon (32) provided
for in the pipe (30).
Chimney base according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterized therein
 that

the container (20) may be slid like a drawer into the
inner chamber (16) of the lower end section (18) of

the chimney base (10).
Chimney base according to one of the claims 1 to 7,
characterized therein
 that

a recess (76) is provided for on the upper part of
the container (20) for the outlet of the pipe (30)

and that the latter opens above a vessel (44) fitted
in the container (20) in horizontal direction and

which can be filled with a neutralisation product.
Chimney base according to one of the claims 1 to 8,
characterized therein
 that

an aperture (143) is provided for in the cover (122)
