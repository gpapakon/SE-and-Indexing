<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cartridge for
applying medicament to an eye from a vial-dispenser of
the type which is actuated by compression of the vial
between its nozzle and its bottom wall.There are various dispensers which are known
for applying medicament to an eye. A typical eye-drop
container includes a flexible vial storage portion and a
nozzle for dispensing drops of medicament into the eye by
squeezing the vial between its side walls. Less common,
but more precise, are accordion-like or piston-like
dispensers which are actuated by squeezing the vial
between a bottom wall and the nozzle so as to compress
the vial in its longitudinal direction, rather than from
its sides. It is these accordion-like or piston-like
dispensers with which the cartridge of the present
invention is particularly adapted for use. An example of
a new and improved piston-like dispenser is the subject
of my co-pending U.S. application serial no. 07/801,243,Most people encounter difficulty in applying
drops to their eyes. The eye is a very sensitive body
part and individuals find it difficult to control
reflexive blinking when applying drops thereto. Also,
eye drop users often have poor vision. Poor vision makes
it difficult to position the tip of the dropper bottle 
over the eye and frequently causes drops to be
incorrectly applied to the nose or cheek. Additionally,
elderly people often have difficulty holding a dropper
bottle steady or encounter difficulty in squeezing the
bottle to apply a proper quantity of the medicament.Even if the liquid medicament is properly
applied to the eye, the medicament's effectiveness is
limited. The minimum volume of a drop of liquid
medicament which can ordinarily be introduced into
contact with an eye at one time is about 30 µl. Any
amount which is greater than about 25µl usually spills
over the eyelid onto the cheek since this is the maximum
volume which the eye can ordinarily handle. When eye
drops are applied to the surface of the eyeball, blinking
and natural tear flow combine to limit the time to a few
minutes that liquid medicament will remain effective.On the other hand, if medicament is applied to
the cul de sac of the conjunctiva, the medicament will
remain effective for a longer period of time, maximizing
the benefits of applying drops of liquid medicament to
the eye. This is because the conjunctiva is an area of
low sensitivity and low tear turnover such that blinking
and tearing are avoided. However, because of the
difficulty encountered in steadying the dropper and
accurately

<CLAIMS>
A device (14) for use in combination with a dispenser-vial for applying
medicament to an eye, said device 14 having a housing (16) and a longitudinally

slidable member (18), said housing (16) having an anterior wall (22) with an aperture
(24) and an open back end (20), and said longitudinally slidable member (18) being

received through the open back end (20) of the housing (16), characterised in that:

said longitudinally slidable member (18) has a flexible outwardly projecting
extension (32) which has a tip (34) engaging an inner surface of the housing (16);
said device (14) further comprises a notch (36) disposed on the inner surface
of the housing having an anterior face (40) and a posterior face (38) which are angled

to the housing and which cooperate with the extension tip (34) such that the extension
tip (34) can be forced over the posterior face upon sliding the slidable member (18)

toward the anterior wall (22) to a locked position where the tip (34) engages the
anterior face (40) of the notch (36), but the tip (34) cannot be forced over the anterior

face (40) upon sliding the member (18) toward the back end of the housing from the
locked position; and
a trigger (42) in the housing having an inner surface for engaging the flexible
extension (32), said trigger (42) being capable of inward movement toward the central

longitudinal axis of the device (14), said trigger (42) being movable to a position
where its inner surface forces the flexible extension tip (34) in its locked position in

a direction towards the slidable member (18) and away from the inner surface of the
housing so that the tip (34) is free to move past the notch (36) upon sliding of the

slidable member (18) away from the anterior wall (22).
The device according to claim 1 wherein the housing is cylindrical and
wherein a finger (28) for engaging an eyelid is attached along the housing (16) at a

point which is about 180° from the location of the trigger (42).
The device according to claim 1 wherein a finger (28) for engaging an eyelid
is attached along the housing (16) and has a surface of a soft thermoplastic material. 
The device (14) according to claim 1 wherein the inner surface of the trigger
has a projecting heel for engaging the flexible extension tip.
The device (14) according to claim 1 wherein the posterior face of the notch
is a smooth inclined surface and wherein the anterior face of the notch is a flat

surface which is normal to the inner surface of the housing.
The device (14) according to claim 1 further comprising a finger (28) for
engaging an eyelid, the finger (28) projecting from an outer surface of the housing

and extending out to a point anterior to the anterior wall (22).
