<ABSTRACT>
A neutral, generally green colored, infrared energy and ultraviolet radiation absorbing glass composition comprises conventional soda-lime-silica float glass ingredients, a relatively high concentration of moderately reduced iron, and titanium oxide(s). The resultant glass exhibits an Illuminant A visible light transmittance of at least 70 %, a total solar energy transmittance not greater than about 46 %, and an ultraviolet radiation transmittance not greater than approximately 38 %, at selected glass thicknesses in the range of 3mm to 5mm. The titanium oxide(s) as well as at least a portion of the iron in the glass is provided by the inclusion of the mineral ilmenite in the glass batch formulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to ultraviolet and
infrared radiation absorbing soda-lime-silica glass compositions
containing oxides of iron and titanium, and to the methods of
making the compositions and forming glass articles therefrom.
More particularly, the invention concerns neutral, generally
green colored glass compositions having a particular combination
of energy absorption and light transmittance properties. The
preferred glass has a narrowly defined dominant wavelength and
color purity. The present invention is particularly useful for
producing automotive and architectural glazings, wherein high
visible light transmittances and low total solar energy and
ultraviolet radiation transmittances are desired.It is generally known to manufacture heat or infrared
radiation absorbing soda-lime-silica glass by the incorporation
therein of iron. The iron is generally present in the glass as
both ferrous oxide (FeO) and ferric oxide (Fe2O3). The balance
between ferrous and ferric oxide has a direct and material
effect on the color and transmittance properties of the glass.
As the ferrous oxide content is increased (as a result of
chemically reducing ferric oxide), the infrared absorption
increases and the ultraviolet absorption decreases. The shift 
toward a higher concentration of FeO in relation to the Fe2O3
also causes a change in the color of the glass from a yellow or
yellow-green to a darker green or blue-green, which reduces the
visible transmittance of the glass. Therefore, in order to
obtain greater infrared absorption in glass without sacrificing
visual transmittance, it has been deemed necessary in the prior
art to produce glass with a low total iron content which is
highly reduced from Fe2O3 to FeO.U.S. Patent No. 2,860,059 discloses an ultraviolet
absorbing glass composition, having a low total iron
concentration, which is described as superior in visible light
transmittance to the greenish-blue glasses generally used in
automotive and architectural glazings. The maximum iron content
is 0.6% by weight, in order for the glass to maintain its
colorless appearance and high visible light transmittance.
Titanium dioxide, and up to 0.5% by weight ceric oxide, are
added to the glass for the purpose of providing ultraviolet
radiation absorption.U.S. Patent No. 1,936,231 discloses a colorless glass,
wherein ferric oxide is added as an ultraviolet radiation cut-off
agent in quantities so small that the resultant glass
retains its high visible light transmittance. The suggested
total iron content is
