<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a mass storage system for a data processing 
system providing data redundancy by mirroring files and 

arranging redundant record copies in a way to reduce access 
time and energy consumption over a pure mirrored 

system. A plurality of mirrored disk drives for long term 
storage of duplicate copies of the records are utilized. 

The logical address for each record is equated to relatively 
displaced radial locations among the mirrored disk 

drives. A controller for the mirrored disk drives maintains 
a record of correspondence between track physical 

addresses and logical addresses, and the current location 
for the transducer positioning arm for each disk drive. 

Upon a read access to a record, the arm closest, in terms 
of track displacement, from the track where a record copy 

is kept is used to access the record copy. Application of 
the method to zone bit recording system is also discussed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to direct access storage devices 
(DASD) and more particularly to a system and method for 
reducing read access time to data which have been duplicated 
to two or more DASD units. A direct access storage device is an information storage 
device in which access time to data is essentially independent 
of the location of the data. The characteristic 
of independence in access time to data distinguishes direct 
access storage devices from serial storage devices 
such as tape drives. Disk drives of various types are the 
most common direct access storage devices. A disk drive is a data storage device which utilizes at 
least one rotatable magnetic disk (or platter). The data 
are represented on the disk as a series a physical transformations 
of a recording media, such as magnetically 
polarized regions of a magnetic material. The physically 
transformed regions are arrayed along the surface of the 
disk along either a plurality of concentric data tracks or 
spiral data tracks. A transducer reads data from a disk by producing an electrical 
signal in response to encountering the physically 
transformed regions. Data is written by using an electrical 
signal to control formation of the physically 
transformed regions along the various tracks on the disk 
while the disk moves underneath the transducer. In magnetic 
systems, the transducer forms a portion of a body 
called a slider. The slider flies just off the surface of 
a rotating disk. The slider is attached on its backside 
to a suspension system which in turn is connected to an  
 
actuator arm. The actuator arm is used to selectively 
position the head over one particular desired track during 
a read or write operation. As the disk is spun the magnetically 
polarized regions pass by the head one after 
another. The slider itself may be moved radially or on an 
arc inward or outward to change the track over which the 
slider is positioned. While disk drive reliability has improved over the last 
few years, the devices are nonetheless electro-mechanical 
and liable to failure. These failures may be caused by a 
circuit defect which affects the readback function, in 
which case no data has been lost. Data may be recovered 
by repair of the circuitry to gain access to the data. If 
the failure occurs at an inconvenient time, the delay in 
recovery may be very expensive to user. If the failure 
occurs in the write circuitry or on the medium itself, 
then the data are permanently lost. If the failure is a 
so called head crash where a

A secondary data storage system, comprising: 
a plurality of direct access storage devices having 

rotating media for recording data; 
means for assigning one logical address to a different 

location on each of the direct access storage 
devices, where the different locations have different 

radial displacement from an axis of rotation for the

A secondary data storage system as set forth in 
Claim 1, and further comprising for each direct access 

storage device: 
a transducer for reading data from and writing data

an arm for positioning the transducer at a selected 

radial displacement from the axis of rotation for the 
rotating media; and
