<ABSTRACT>
A multi-function support structure (1) comprises a box-shaped 
body (2) consisting of one section member (3) 

adapted to define a longitudinal inner cavity (4) for 
housing service ducts, and a second section member (5) 

to be engaged to the first section member (3) so as to 
form a closing cover for said cavity (4) and define an 

attachment portion for operating elements accessible 
externally of the longitudinal cavity itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-function 
support structure, in particular for electric 
installations. It is known that many types of facilities are 
increasingly more required in domestic use premises, 
work and medical centres and others. These facilities 
are generally distributed by means of ducts of several 
different types, such as mains-voltage electric cables, 
fluid-conveying pipes, sheaths containing communication 
cables, low-voltage electric lines, and similar 
components. In addition, there is always a need for appropriate 
connecting members to be provided at the points of use 
of the above facilities, such as for example electric 
sockets, supports for lighting elements, pipe fitting 
members, hooks for hanging different types of devices, 
push-button panels and the like. Usually, when ducts and relavant connecting members have 
not been put inside the walls during the wall 
construction, they are subsequently added by fastening 
them externally of the walls and are therefore 
unconcealed. While this known solution avoids masonry 
works, on the other hand it does not often provide 
installations offering reliable safety guarantees 
because, for example, live cables are insufficiently 
protected. In addition, this solution is not always economically 
advantageous and of easy accomplishment because it has 
the drawback that not only fastening of sockets and 
connecting members must be carried out directly to the 
walls, ceiling or floor, but also each individual piping  
 
or line must be secured thereto, as well as all lighting 
elements and further elements required at the moment or 
added at some future time. Under this situation, the general aim of the present 
invention is to provide a multi-function support 
structure, in particular for electric installations, 
capable of substantially eliminating the above 
drawbacks. Within the scope of this general aim, an important 
object of the present invention is to provide a multifunction 
support structure enabling a plurality of ducts 
to be protected by gathering them together in an orderly 
manner along the intended paths until they reach the use 
points, thereby avoiding them being directly fastened to 
the walls, floor or pieces of furniture. Another important object of the invention is to provide 
a multi-function structure capable of allowing the 
operating elements to be readily supported and/or 
fastened. The above specified objects are substantially achieved 
by a multi-function support structure characterized in 
that it

<CLAIMS>
A multi-function support structure, in particular for 
electric installations, characterized in that it 

comprises a box-shaped body (2) having a prevailing 
extension in the longitudinal direction and consisting 

of at least one section member (3) adapted to define a 
longitudinal inner cavity (4) and at least a second 

section member (5) to be engaged to said first section 
member (3) so as to form a closing cover for said cavity 

(4), at least one of said section members (3, 5) 
exhibiting in said cavity (4), longitudinal seatings (6) 

adapted to house service ducts, and least one of said 

section members (3, 5) defining an attachment portion 
for operating elements susceptible of being accessible 

externally of said longitudinal cavity (4). 
A structure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said second section member (5) close to one edge 

(5a) thereof exhibits a longitudinal bulging portion 
(13) adapted to rotatably engage with a corresponding 

recessed seating (14) in said section member (3), and 
close to a second edge (5b) thereof exhibits a shaped 

tailpiece (15) adapted to be snap-fitted in a 
corresponding projection (16) in said first section 

member (3). 
A structure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that externally of said cavity (4) said section members 

(3, 5) exhibit at least one longitudinal groove (17) 
defining at least one track (18) for electric conductors 

(18a). 
A structure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that externally of said cavity (4) said first section 

member (3) exhibits at least one longitudinal bent 
portion adapted to define a hooking region for suspended weights.
