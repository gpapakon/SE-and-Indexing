<ABSTRACT>
A method for decoding an encoded non-return to zero (NRZ) signal without the use of external clock. Transitions within the encoded NRZ signal cause a differential voltage signal to be output. This differential voltage increases at a constant rate between two transitions. At the second transition the magnitude of the differential voltage is compared to a preset value to determine a number of consecutive like bits. These consecutive bits can then be transmitted in one step to a storage means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data processing systems, and more specifically, to a
system for decoding a digital bit stream which is transmitted within a digital data
communication system.Digital information is commonly transmitted between different data processing
systems via an electronic signal. The information is encoded in a series of high and low
pulses which are transmitted, decoded, and then stored in temporary memory registers.
This signal is commonly known as nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ).From EP-A-0 377 335 such a decoder is known which receives a bit stream of biphase-coded
data, detects the edges of the pulses forming the bit stream, determines the time
periods between said edges and decodes the sequence of bits in the bit stream from said
determined time periods.In most data transmission systems, the NRZ signal is encoded so that the number
of consecutive like bits in the bit stream is limited to a particular number. This is done
in order to avoid errors in the reading of the data. A well known encoding scheme such
as 4B5B limits the number of like bits which may be transmitted to either four or five
before a transition in the electronic signal, or bit stream, will occur.When digital data is transmitted via a serial bit stream, difficulties may be
encountered in finding the proper means to extract the data from the incoming bit
stream. One decoding method provides a clock signal which controls at what intervals
the incoming data is read or sampled. In most cases the pulses from a voltage control
oscillator are used as a clock. Every time a pulse is output from the oscillator, a reading
is taken from the bit stream.In systems which use a clock signal to decode, means must be provided to
synchronize the clock signal with the incoming bit stream. This can be done by
including a preamble in the bit stream. This preamble is at the beginning of the bit
stream and contains a series of test signals which align the clock with the incoming data.
If the data stream and the clock are not properly synchronized, data will be read at the
wrong time, possibly causing multiple bit errors.Any system which uses clock signals may be susceptible to noise which may
appear in the signal of the digital data stream. Noise or frequency variations in the bit
stream can cause the data and the clock to become misaligned which in turn causes bit
errors. Also, a preamble degrades link latency when multiple sources are to be received.
thus slowing the system.Another type of prior art system includes the timing signal in the
