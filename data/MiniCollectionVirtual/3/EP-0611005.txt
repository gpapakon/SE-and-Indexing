<ABSTRACT>
Supplementary taillight for automobiles useful to 
indicate to the driver of an automobile that the vehicle 

in front of him is slowing down comprised of a two-color 
pilot light, one red and one amber, placed in the bottom 

center part of the rear plate of the vehicle and which is 
interconnected with the electronic control unit (1) which 

picks up signals from the sensors (2) and acts in terms 
of the operating conditions of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a supplementary tail-light 
system for automobiles having a rear window and two conventional 
rear brake lights activated by a stepped-down brake 
pedal for providing warning information to other drivers when 
a vehicle is slowing down. All moving vehicles have kinetic energy in terms of the operating 
conditions at each moment, in other words, of the speed 
and mass of the vehicle, though the former has a greater influence 
than the latter. The kinetic energy is proportional 
to the mass of the vehicle and to the square of the speed 
thereof. In the case of the vehicle stopping or braking suddenly, the 
brake system of the automobile will absorb all the kinetic 
energy of the moving vehicle until it comes to a full stop, 
going a so-called stopping distance. Road traffic conditions require each drive to keep a minimum 
distance between vehicles while they are moving, so that, in 
the event of braking, the vehicle can stop without the danger 
of causing a collision (rear collision.) This minimum distance 
between vehicles is called the safety distance. The theoretical safety distance between vehicles depends on 
the traffic conditions (intensity of traffic), speed of the 
vehicles, visibility and road conditions. A predominating factor of the safety distance between vehicles 
is the distance travelled during the driver's reaction 
in the following stages:  
 
1) optical perception 2) assimilation of what has happened 3) decision 4) control of the vehicle In this process, from the driver's reaction until the vehicle 
comes to a full stop (emergency situation) factors of vital 
importance such as the following have an influence: 
1) the driver's perception  2) the driver's visibility 3) technical improvements of the vehicle (ABS, suspension, 
etc.) The driver's total reaction time is that which elapses between 
the moment when he perceives the need to brake and the 
moment when he begins to step down on the brake pedal. As an average of the careful driver's reaction time, around 
0.6 seconds can be accepted, however, this dead time frequently 
reaches 0.75 seconds when the driver's attention is 
not full, and even longer periods of time depending on the 
driver's state and conditions. In short, there is a series of variables and circumstances 
that vary the distance travelled by the vehicle before it 
comes to a stop, causing in many cases irremediable rear collisions. In rear collisions, the automobile that causes the impact, 
transmits its kinetic energy to the vehicle

A supplementary tail-light system for automobiles having 
a rear window and two conventional rear brake lights activated by a stepped-down brake 

pedal, for providing warning information to other drivers 
when a vehicle is slowing down, comprising: 


a supplementary tail-light positioned at the bottom center 
part of the rear window of the car, said supplementary 

tail-light being positioned such that the two conventional 
break lights and said supplementary tail-light constitute 

the corners of an imaginary triangle; 
sensors (2); 
an electronic control unit (1), including means for 
receiving signals from the sensors (2), means for 

detecting deceleration and means for activating the 
supplementary tail-light when deceleration over a 

predetermined threshold is detected; 
 
wherein 


the supplementary tail-light comprises a two-colour 
lamp for selectively emitting red light or amber light; 
the tail-light system including means for 

activating the amber light when deceleration over a 
certain threshold is detected; 
activating the red light when the brake pedal is 
being stepped down; and 
deactivating 
the amber light when the brake pedal is 

stepped down.
