<ABSTRACT>
A cutting device for cutting flat workpieces, especially steel cord, comprises a blade and a counter-blade. The movable metal blade, which has two surfaces adjoining at an angle at its cutting edge, is pressed on the counter-blade with a pressure running transversely to the cutting force. At its cutting edge the counter-blade is blunted in such a way that it has at least three adjacent surfaces enclosing a blunted angle.

A cutting device having a counter-blade made of metal 
with a cutting edge for cutting flat workpieces, in 

particular steel cord, with the cutting device including 
a blade made of metal, with cutting edge, interacting 

with the counter-blade by producing a cutting force and 
movable relative to the counter-blade, with the blade, at 

its cutting edge, having two faces adjacent to one 
another at an angle and with the blade being pressed 

towards the counter-blade with a contact pressure acting 
transversally to the cutting force,
characterized in that
 the counter-blade (3, 3', 3'') is 
blunted at its cutting edge, against which the blade (2) 

is pressed by the transversally acting contact pressure 
(F), so that it has at least three faces (6, 7, 8) 

adjacent to one another whilst enclosing obtuse angles 
(α, β). 
A cutting device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the counter-blade is rounded (17) 
at its cutting edge. 
A cutting device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the counter-blade is made of hard 
metal in the region (20) of its blunt cutting edge. 
A cutting device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 with the presence of three adjacent 
faces (6, 7, 9) at the cutting edge of the counter-blade 

(3), the angle (β) between the two faces (7, 8) lying 
distant from the workpiece (4) have a value of roughly 

100° to roughly 180°.  
 
A cutting device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 a first face (6; 11; 21) of the 
counter-blade (3, 3', 3'') lying directly opposite the 

workpiece (4) encloses an angle (τ) of roughly 20° to 
roughly 120° with a further face (8, 14, 16) disposed the 

furthest away from the workpiece (4). 
A cutting device according to Claim 5,
characterized in that
 the counter-blade (3) has four 
adjacent faces (11, 12, 13, 14) in the region of its 

cutting edge (20), with the second face (12) adjacent to 
the first face (11) forming an angle (δ) of roughly 2° to 

roughly 85° with a face (15) parallel to the further face 
(14) and with the third face (13) adjacent to the further 

face (14) forming an angle (ε) in the range of roughly 
0° to roughly 70° with the face (15) parallel to the 

further face (14). 
A cutting device according to one or more of the 
preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 - seen in the direction of movement 
of the blade (2) and also measured transversally to the 

longitudinal direction of the cutting edge - the width 
(d; d'; d'') of the blunted region (7; 12, 13; 17) of the 

counter-blade is at most roughly 1 mm. 
A cutting device according to Claim 7,
characterized in that
 the width of the blunted region of 
the counter-blade is roughly 0.02 mm to roughly 0.5 mm.
