<ABSTRACT>
The thickness of the entire surface of a thick 
semiconductor (94) layer on an insulator is determined 

all at once by dividing the surface into a plurality of 
pixels, by varying the length of a variable length 

optical path (110) in a Michelson interferometer (66) 
having an infrared source (62), illuminating the entire 

surface of the layer with an image of the IR source 
during the length variation operation, and by detecting 

(64) the product of the intensity (I
s
(z)) from the 
Michelson interferometer and the reflectivity R(t) of the 

layer as the path length is varied, such being indicative 
of the thickness of the layer, and by determining, for 

each pixel, which one of a plurality of groups of stored 
reflectance values, for a corresponding plurality of 

thicknesses, best matches the detected values, thereby 
providing a thickness map of the semiconductor layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application discloses subject matter that may 
be disclosed and claimed in copending applications having 
the following Serial Numbers, filing dates and titles:
 
   (1) Serial No. 07/804,872 (filed on December 6, 1991) 
entitled "Apparatus and Method for Measuring the 
Thickness of Thin Films";
 
   (2) Serial Number 07/906,079 (filed June 29, 1992) 
entitled "Apparatus and Method for Performing Thin Film 
Layer Thickness Metrology on a Thin Film Layer Having 
Shape Deformations and Local Slope Variations";
 
   (3) Serial Number 07/891,344 (filed May 29, 1992) 
entitled "Apparatus and Method for Performing Thin Film 
Layer Thickness Metrology By Deforming A Thin Film Layer 
Into A Reflective Condenser"; and
 
   Serial Number (Atty. Docket No. D92020) (filed 
December 10, 1992) entitled "Apparatus and Method for 
Measuring the Thickness of Thin Films" and assigned to 
the assignee hereof and which are hereby expressly 
incorporated by reference. The present invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for measuring the thickness of a semiconductor 
such as the outer layer of a semiconductor-on-insulator 
wafer for thicknesses of more than five microns and up to 
many hundreds of microns. There are no accurate full aperture imaging systems 
which can measure very thick layers of silicon in a 
bonded wafer and provide a thickness map of the outer 
layer. Commercial instruments operate one point at a 
time on the wafer in either the ultraviolet or visible 
region and cannot measure films hundreds of microns thick  
 
since the high absorption in the silicon outer layer 
effectively eliminates fringe formation. Even though infrared radiation is not absorbed as 
much, it is difficult to achieve a plurality of 
narrowband infrared filters such as would be required to 
expose the wafer separately to many different infrared 
wavelengths (as was similarly done in the above mentioned 
copending application Serial No. 07/804,872) with visible 
light for relatively thin layers of silicon on insulator, 
i.e., on the order of four or five microns or even tens 
of microns thick. Semiconductor manufacturers presently purchase 
silicon wafers that have been micropolished down to the 
four-to-five micron thickness range. The above cited 
patent application permits smoothing down to less than 
100 nanometer with uniformity better than 10 percent. 
Nevertheless, it has heretofore been required to purchase 
wafers already micromachined down to the four-to-five 
micron thickness level as a starting point. This is due
