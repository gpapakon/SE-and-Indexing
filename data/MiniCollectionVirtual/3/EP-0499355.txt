<ABSTRACT>
A medical stapler includes a front wall (13) having an 
opening (17) at a lower end portion thereof. A mirror (60) is 

mounted in the vicinity of an upper edge (17a) of this opening. 
A straight line, representing a wound (S) pinched by a pincette 

by the operator, is reflected on the mirror. The operator 
adjusts the posture of the stapler so that the straight line of 

the actual wound (S) can be aligned with the straight line (S') 
reflected on the mirror, and in this condition the staple is 

shaped so as to effect the suturing of the wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical or surgical stapler. A medical stapler disclosed in US-A-4,411,378 (= GB-A-2 092 503), 
includes a casing having a front wall. A ram is mounted within 
the casing so as to slidingly move along the front wall. An 
opening is formed in the lower end portion of the front wall. 
This opening is formed by an upper edge, disposed perpendicular 
to a path of movement of the ram, and a pair of side edges 
extending respectively from the opposite ends of this upper edge 
in parallel relation to the path of movement of the ram. An 
anvil is provided in the path of movement of the ram, and is 
disposed in the vicinity of the opening. The center of the upper 
edge of the opening is aligned with the center of the width of 
the anvil in the direction of the length of the upper edge of the 
opening. Mounted within the casing is a staple supply device 
which holds a plurality of staples in contiguous relation to one 
another, and supplies these staples sequentially to the anvil. 
Each staple has a crown portion, and a pair of legs extending 
angularly from the opposite ends of the crown portion, 
respectively. The crown portion of the foremost staple is placed 
on the upper surface of the anvil, with its center aligned with 
the center of the width of the anvil, and is disposed in parallel 
relation to the upper edge of the opening. Through the 
cooperation of the advancing ram with the anvil, the foremost 
staple is shaped in such a manner that the pair of legs are moved 
toward each other, thereby suturing a wound of a patient during 
this shaping operation.  
 The above suturing operation will now be described in 
detail. The operator grasps the stapler with one hand, and holds 
a pincette with the other hand, and the opposed sides of the 
wound are brought toward each other by the pincette to render the 
wound generally straight. Then, an operating member of the 
stapler is manipulated to advance the ram so as to shape the 
foremost staple in the above-mentioned manner, thereby effecting 
the suturing operation. In order to achieve a good suturing, it 
is required to shape the staple while keeping the staple 
perpendicular to the wound. To meet this requirement, the 
operator must overhang the patient so that his eyes can be 
disposed right above the wound, and in this condition the 
operator must shape the staple, while confirming that the upper 
edge of the opening of the stapler is kept perpendicular to the 
wound. Therefore, the operator is forced to take an unnatural 
posture

<CLAIMS>
A medical stapler comprising: 

(a) a casing (10) including a front wall (13) having an 
opening (17) at a lower end portion thereof; 
(b) staple supply means (59) mounted within said casing so 
as to hold a plurality of staples (1) in contiguous relation to 

one another, said staple supply means sequentially supplying said 
staples to a position near said opening, each of said staples 

having a crown portion (1a) and a pair of legs (1b) extending 
respectively from opposite ends of said crown portion, and said 

crown portion of a foremost one of said plurality of staples 
extending in substantially parallel relation to said front wall; 

and 
(c) shaping means (80) mounted on said casing so as to shape 
the foremost staple, disposed near said opening, in such a manner 

said pair of legs of said foremost staple are brought toward each 
other; 
 
   CHARACTERIZED in that a mirror (60) is mounted on an outer 

surface of said front wall (13) in the vicinity of an upper edge 
(17a) of said opening (17). 
A medical stapler according to claim 1, in which said upper 
edge (17a) of said opening (17) is disposed in 

parallel relation to the crown portion (1a) of the foremost 
staple (1), the center of the crown portion of the foremost 

staple being aligned with the center of said upper 
edge of said opening in a direction of the length of said crown  

 
portion of said foremost staple. 
A medical stapler according to claim 2, in which said mirror 
(60) extends upwardly a predetermined distance 

from said upper edge (17a) of said opening (17). 
A medical stapler according to claim 3, in which indication 
means (61) for indicating the center of said upper edge (17a) of 

said opening (17) is provided on said mirror (60). 
A medical stapler according to claim 1, in which said 
shaping means (80) comprises a ram (22) mounted within said 

casing (10) for sliding movement along said front wall (13), an 
operating member (25) mounted on said casing for moving said ram 

downward, and an anvil (40) disposed in a path of movement of 
said ram in the vicinity of said opening (17) of said front wall, 

the crown portion (1a) of the foremost staple (1) being placed 
on said anvil, and the foremost staple being shaped through the

which is higher than the plane of an upper surface of said anvil 
(40) by an amount corresponding to the diameter of said crown 

portion (1a) of said staple (1), and a position in 
the plane of a lower surface of said anvil.  

 
A medical stapler according to claim 6, in which said upper 
edge (17a) of said opening (17) is disposed between the plane of 

the upper surface of said anvil (40) and the plane of the lower 
surface of said anvil. 
A medical stapler according to claim 7, in which said staple 
supply means (59) comprises guide means (35) for supporting said 

plurality of staples (1) in contiguous relation to one another, 
and urging means (50) for urging said plurality of staples,
