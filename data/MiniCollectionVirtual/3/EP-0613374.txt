<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions and
methods employing said compositions for preventing
urogenital tract infections.It is well known that indigenous, non-pathogenic
bacteria predominate on intestinal, vaginal
and uro-epithelial cells and associated mucus in the
healthy state, and that pathogenic organisms (such as
bacteria, yeast, chlamydia, viruses) predominate in the
stages leading to and during infections. Organisms such
as Escherichia coli, enterococci, candida, Gardnerella
and Klebsiella originate from the bowel, colonize the
perineum, vagina, urethra and can infect the bladder and
vagina. Treatment with antimicrobial agents is required
to eradicate the organisms. However, infections can and
do recur, for the urinary tract in an estimated 80% of
cases. Prolonged use of antimicrobial agents creates drug
resistant pathogens, breakthrough infections and a
disruption of the normal flora. The possibility that
indigenous bacteria have a role in preventing infection
has been postulated for many years, but few studies have
been carried out to identify specific bacteria and their
properties required for such an effect. United States
patent no. 4,314,995 to Hata et al. investigated
anaerobic, lactobacilli-like organisms as a means of
treating a number of infectious diseases, but no
consideration was given to the combined importance of
their hydrophobicity, hydrophillicity, adhesiveness to
biomaterials, epithelial cells, mucus and tissues, and no
discussion was included to prevent urogenital infections. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,347,240 to Mutai et al. discloses a
composition and method employing a specific strain of
lactobacilli to inhibit tumour growth.In recent years, our group has investigated the
use of lactobacillus to prevent recurrent urinary tract
infections, particularly in adult women. Our conclusion
has been that the ability of lactobacilli to adhere,
inhibit, competitively exclude and coaggregate formed the
basis for the protection of the host. However, new and
more important information has now come to light, further
to human and experimental studies. The invention now
takes into account a new infectious state
(microbial urogenital re-infections after antimicrobial treatment) as distinct from
simple urinary tract infection. The former is initiated
following use of antimicrobial agents. This application
was not obvious previously, as previous literature has
concentrated on virulence characteristics of pathogens
causing problems, ignoring the fact that recurrences can
follow the use of external
