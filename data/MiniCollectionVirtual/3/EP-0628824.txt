<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transport
system for instruments utilized in the analysis of fluids
and, more particularly, relates to a transport system
adapted to be employed in the automated analysis of blood
samples.In the analysis of fluids, for instance, such
as blood samples and the like, it has become important to
be able to implement a procedure in which the samples are
rapidly prepared in an essentially automated mode for
analysis with a minimal need for manual intervention or
handling, and wherein such blood samples are transported
in a computer-controlled manner from an initial
preparation station to a final auto-read station
providing for the analysis of the prepared blood sample
or samples. To achieve the foregoing, provision may be
made for the storage of cassettes transportable to a
suitable carousel which may incorporate an incubator
rotor and a rotor for operating at room temperature;
wherein a pipettor is adapted to aspirate fluids
comprising blood samples and specified selected reagents
and to transport these fluids to the cassette or
cassettes stored in the carousel and fill them into wells
in the cassettes pursuant to the particular blood
analyses which are to be implemented. Thereafter, the
cassette or cassettes containing the blood and reagent
samples is or are transported to a centrifuge where the
samples are centrifuged to provide for appropriate mixing
thereof, and are then transported to a further carousel 
or rotor operatively associated with an auto-reader for
effectuating the spectrographic or visual analysis of the
blood sample. When the analysis of the blood sample is
considered to be qualitatively satisfactory, there is
then carried out the discarding of the cassette.In order to be able to implement the foregoing
sequence in a substantially automated manner, a transport
system including cassette transporting and filling
structure is provided to extend over and operatively
interconnect various stations of a blood analysis
apparatus consisting of a blood sample and reagent supply
holder, a storage unit for unused cassettes, a carousel
or rotor containing an incubator chamber and a room
temperature chamber for the receipt and filling with
blood samples of cassettes, a centrifuge and an automated
readout rotor. The essentially computer-controlled
operation of the transport system and instruments
employed which enables movements of the various operative
components in at least three mutually orthogonal
directions; in effect, within mutually perpendicular
horizontal planes
