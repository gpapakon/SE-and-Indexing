<ABSTRACT>
An alumina sorbent capable of adsorbing NOx and SOx 
from waste gases and being regenerated by heating above 

650°C is made by incorporating an alumina stabilizing 
agent into the sorbent. A preferred method is to add the 

stabilizer when the alumina is precipitated. The 
precipitated powder is formed subsequently into a slurry, 

milled and spray dried to form the stabilized spheroidal 
alumina particles having a particle size of less than 500 

microns. These particles are impregnated with an alkali 
metal or alkaline earth metal to form the stabilized 

sorbent. Alumina stabilizers include one or more of 
silica, lanthana, other rare earths, titania, zirconia 

and alkaline earths.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved sorbent 
for removing NOx and SOx from exhaust gases and the 
improved removal process using that sorbent. The NOXSO process, described in U.S. Patent No. 
4,798,711, uses a porous alumina sorbent containing 
sodium to adsorb NOx and SOx from flue gases. The 
process involves using beads of a sufficient size so that 
they can be used in a fluidized bed system. When 
discussing the attrition test they use beads of 10 to 20 
mesh (about 2 mm to about 840 µm). Since a 20 mesh screen has openings of about 840 
µm, the particles will be at least 840 µm in 
diameter. After the adsorption the nitrogen- and sulfur-laden 
sorbent is regenerated by heating the sorbent in a 
reducing atmosphere. In addition to other preferred reducing atmospheres 
for regenerating, methane gas is also disclosed. 
However, by using natural gas or methane the regenerator 
operates at a higher temperature of about 650°C which 
tends to further reduce the surface area of the alumina 
beads. As this NOXSO sorbent cycles back and forth from 
adsorption to regeneration, it undergoes transformations 
which reduce its surface area. In the fresh condition 
the alumina sorbent has a surface area on the order of 
about 200 m2/g. After about 100 cycles the surface area 
of the sorbent is reduced to below 50 m2/g. When the  
 
surface area becomes that low, the performance becomes 
unacceptable. In U. S. Patent No. 5,180,703, an improved sorbent 
is made by adding a stabilizer to an alumina forming 
slurry. The preferred alumina stabilizer is silica which 
can be added in the form of sodium silicate. The 
resulting silica alumina coprecipitate is preferably 
filtered, washed and dried to a powder. The powder is 
slurried in a water/nitric acid/acetic acid mixture and 
dripped in a drip column containing a NH3-liquid 
hydrocarbon phase on top of an aqueous ammonia phase. 
The silica stabilized alumina beads are dried and 
calcined and then impregnated with up to 1-20 wt % with 
an active ingredient of either an alkali metal or 
alkaline earth metal and preferably with sodium at about 
4-6 wt %, by the incipient wetness technique. The beads 
are screened to pass through 10 mesh (about 2 mm) and remain on 20 
mesh (about 840 µm). Since a 20 mesh screen has openings of 840 
µm, the particles will be at least 840 µm in 
diameter. The beads have sodium carbonate on them. When this 
strong base contacts the acidic SO2 present in flue gas, a 
very rapid acid-base reaction occurs. Initially the SO2 
and NO gas
