<ABSTRACT>
A hearing aid with digital, electronic compensation for acoustic feedback comprises a microphone (5), a preamplifier (7), a digital compensation circuit (3), an output amplifier (9) and a transducer (11). The digital circuit (3) comprises a noise generator (33) for the insertion of noise, and an adjustable, digital filter (27) for the adaptation of the feedback signal. The adaptation takes place using a correlation circuit (31). The circuit further comprises a digital circuit (79) which carries out a statistical evaluation of the filter coefficients in the correlation circuit, and changes the feedback function in accordance with this evaluation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a digital hearing aid as diclosed in more detail in the
preamble to claim 1.A hearing aid of this kind with digital suppression of or compensation for acoustic
feedback is known from the applicant's earlier European patent application no.
90309342.5 (publication no. EP-A2-0415677). The present application is related
to this European application, which was filed on August 24th 1990.It is known from EP-A2-0.415.677 to monitor the digital filter and change the
coefficients when changes occur in the acoustic feedback path, in that a digital
circuit monitors and controls the updating of the coefficients in the filter.Such a hearing aid has in practice proved to function as intended. In order for
the hearing aid not to oscillate, the compensation, which is carried out by
updating the coefficients in a digital filter in a feedback circuit, is effected by
means of an algorithm or function which takes into account the error in the filter,
i.e. the difference between the filter's actual setting and the desired setting. Such
a hearing aid will not always be quick enough to adapt to sudden changes in the
acoustic feedback path, even though it is still able to compensate for the
acoustic feedback which arises. The lack of speed in the adaptation function can
result in undesired acoustic signals which can be heard by the user of the
hearing aid.The object of the present invention is to increase the adaptation speed without 
hereby giving rise to any inconvenience for the user of the hearing aid. In order
to be quite certain that the hearing aid does not begin to oscillate, the function or
algorithm which takes care of the updating of the coefficients in the digital filter in
the compensation circuit must take into consideration that the filter error
depends on the number of coefficients, signal/noise ratio, input level, volume,
and on the degree of peak clipping in the limiter circuit. Such an embracing
function or algorithm will not be particularly fast in adapting itself to changes in
the acoustic feedback path, but on the other hand it will provide a reliable and
precise adjustment of the filter under stationary conditions in the feedback path.By configuring the hearing aid according to the invention as characterized in
claim 1, the updating of the coefficients in the filter takes place following a choice
between a number of adaption rates, so that the hearing aid selects between
alternative adaption rates when a significant change occurs in the acoustic
feedback path. It for example, the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Hearing aid in which acoustic feedback between the transducer (11) and the
microphone (5) is compensated for electronically by means of an electrical

feedback signal produced using an adjustable digital filter (27), the coefficients of
which are adjusted in accordance with the actual acoustic feedback, and where

the microphone signal is converted to digital signals (17) which pass an
amplitude-limiting circuit (15) which is arranged to prevent the transducer from

entering its non-linear range, and where a digital noise signal (33, 21) and the
electrical feedback signal in the form of a digital compensation signal (27, 23)

are added to the microphone signal, after which the composite signal is fed to a
digital-analogue converter (19) from where the analogue signal is fed to the

transducer (11) via an amplifier (9), and where the digital filter (27) is controlled
by a correlation circuit (31) and also where the hearing aid comprises a digital

circuit (79) which monitors and controls the updating of the coefficients in the
digital filter (27), 
characterized in
 that the digital circuit (79) controls the
correlation circuit (31) which supplies the digital filter (27) with filter coefficients,

that the digital circuit (79) is arranged to monitor and control the updating of the
coefficients in the digital filter (27) in accordance with a function with two or more

adaption rates, where at least the one adaption rate effects the updating
considerably more quickly than the second or the other adaption rates, and that

the digital circuit (79) is arranged to control the changeover of the adaption rate
with which the updating of the digital filter (27) is currently being carried out, on

the basis of an evaluation of the standard deviation of the filter coefficients and updating
being carried out by the correlation circuit (31).
Hearing aid according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the digital circuit (79)
is arranged to carry out the evaluation on the basis of the monitoring of

all filter coefficients which are currently being changed.
