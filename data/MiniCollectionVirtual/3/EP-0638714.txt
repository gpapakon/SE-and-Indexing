<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel internal
combustion engine design to reduce the length of engines
with a large number of cylinders.For both alternate mass balancing and more
strictly thermodynamic reasons, high performance engines
normally present a large number of cylinders, typically
twelve or sixteen. As opposed to being arranged in-line
as in the past, the cylinders are now arranged in a V
composed of two lines or banks of six or eight side by
side in-line cylinders converging in a V towards an
ideal apex consisting of the drive shaft or crankshaft.
Typically, the crankshaft is located at the bottom with
the oil sump to catch the oil by gravity, and at the top
the opposite ends of the diverging cylinders in the two
banks are connected to two heads - one for each bank -
with the timing systems and members.A major drawback of the above designs is the
considerable size involved both lengthwise, on account
of the side by side arrangement of a large number of
cylinders in one line or bank, and vertically, due to 
the presence of the supply members, particularly the
intake and exhaust manifolds and engine valve control
systems. The engine shown in US-A-2 507 923 is not a solution of the mentioned drawbacks, because it is extremely difficult to lubricate.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an engine designed to overcome the above
drawbacks and which at the same time is relatively
straightforward to produce.According to the present invention, there is
provided an internal combustion engine as defined in Claim 1. The resulting engine presents what may
be defined in general terms as a "superimposed twin V"
design which, for a given piston displacement and number
of cylinders, provides for drastically reducing both the
length and height of the engine as compared with
conventional currently used designs, particularly those
with in-line cylinders or V cylinders at any angle. The
superimposed twin V design also provides for simplifying
the structure, reducing the number of cylinder heads,
and, more especially, for drastically reducing the
weight of the engine for a given piston displacement and
power.According to the invention, the engine is
installed with a first oil sump at the bottom and a
second oil sump inverted at the top.Moreover, the common block presents a first number 
of vertical passages formed at the respective converging
ends of the first and second cylinders in each group,
for maintaining constant hydraulic communication between
the first and second oil sumps. Optionally,
