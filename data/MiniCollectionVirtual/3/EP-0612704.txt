<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for acidifying manure, 
in particular slurry, in which the ammonia present in the 

manure is substantially fixed in the manure and the carbonates 
present in the manure are substantially discharged in the form 

of carbon dioxide gas, wherein for the acidification, acid-producing 
bacteria are used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for acidifying manure, 
in particular slurry, in which the ammonia present in the 
manure is substantially fixed in the manure and the carbonates 
present in the manure are substantially emitted in the form of 
carbon dioxide gas. Manure, and more particularly slurry, is produced in very 
large quantities at modern stock farms. Until recently, this 
manure was uilized practically exclusively as a soil 
fertilizer on agricultural lands. Over the last few years, 
more and more measures have been taken by the government to 
reduce the amount of manure annually introduced into the 
environment per hectare of agricultural land. The objective of 
these measures is to push back the detrimental environmental 
effects that occur if too much manure is introduced into the 
environment. Accordingly, it is endeavored to find other ways of 
disposing of the amount of manure produced. One of the 
possibilities to that end is the industrial processing or 
drying of manure, yielding a valuable fertilizer, for instance 
in the form of concentrated manure pellets. Such processing 
has a number of advantages. In the first place, the volume of 
the product to be processed is reduced considerably. In 
addition, it is possible to control the composition of the dry 
manure pellets by mixing different types of manure and/or by 
admixing other products. Thus, a product can be produced that  
 
is useful for fertilizing applications for which slurry as 
such is less suitable, if at all, such as the application in 
horticulture. Moreover, the pellets produced can be simply 
transported and exported to regions where there is a great 
demand for fertilizers. Before the manure is presented to a manure processing 
plant, it will have to be stored at the stock farm for a 
considerable time, for instance six weeks, in manure vaults or 
manure silos. During the storage of manure, a considerable 
amount of ammonia is generated. This ammonia is formed during 
the break-down of nitrogen-containing compounds, such as 
proteins, under the influence of microorganisms present in the 
manure. The pH of slurry is generally between 7.2 and 8.2. More 
particularly, the pH of fresh manure is lower than the pH of 
older manure. At a pH in the range mentioned, the ammonia 
generated will be emitted into the atmosphere in the form of 
gas. This emission of ammonia must be prevented, not only from 
the point of view of environmental protection, but also to 
ensure the highest possible quality of the dry manure to be 
fo

<CLAIMS>
A process for acidifying manure, in particular slurry, in 
which the ammonia present is substantially fixed in the manure 

and the carbonates present in the manure are substantially 
discharged in the form of carbon dioxide gas, characterized in 

that for acidification acid-producing bacteria are used, and 
that the pH of the manure to be acidified is adjusted a single 

time to a value lower than approximately 6.5, wherein the use 
of colloidal support material upon which bacteria and yeasts 

are fixed and the introduction of air or oxygen in the manure 
to such an extent that the circumstances in the manure become 

essentially aerobic are disclaimed. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
day-fresh manure is treated with acid-producing bacteria. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the manure is treated with lactic acid-producing 

bacteria. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the manure is treated with lactic acid-producing 

bacteria of the genus 
Lactobacillus
, preferably of 
the species 
Lactobacillus
plantarum
. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the treatment occurs in such a manner 

that the pH of the manure decreases to a value between 4.5 and 
6.2 and is maintained in this range.  

 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it is carried out in a "fed-batch" 

system. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that substrates for acid-producing bacteria 

are added to the manure. 
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that 
sugars, in particular glucose, are added. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that also microorganisms or enzymes are 

added, which are capable of breaking down macromolecular 
substrates into substrates for the acid-producing bacteria. 
A process as claimed in 9, characterized in that also 
macromolecular substrates are added to the manure.
