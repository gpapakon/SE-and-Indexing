<ABSTRACT>
A butyrophenone transdermal composition which comprises 
the following components (a) to (f): 


(a) a water-soluble polymer which is constituted by a 
monomer containing, partly or wholly, aliphatic carboxylic 

acid having a polymerizable double bond or a salt of the 
carboxylic acid, 
(b) a cross linking agent, 
(c) a cross linking promoter, 
(d) water, 
(e) a butyrophenone drug, and 
(f) a solvent for the butyrophenone drug (e), 
 
as essential components. The pH of the composition is 

adjusted to fall in the range of 5.5 to 8.0. 
With the composition of the invention, the 
concentration of the active component butyrophenone in blood 

can be controlled. The composition is capable of exhibiting 
its primary action, antiemetic action, without causing rash 

in the skin and with less adverse side effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to butyrophenone 
transdermal compositions (hereinafter may be referred to as 
transdermal compositions) capable of inhibiting vomiting 
which occurs as an adverse side effect when chemotherapeutic 
drugs against cancer are administered. Vomiting which occurs as an adverse side effect when 
chemotherapeutic drugs against cancer are administered is a 
hindrance in achieving effective cancer treatment. In order 
to inhibit vomiting caused by the administration of 
chemotherapeutic drugs against cancer, countermeasures such 
as massive dose therapy using metoclopramide, combination 
use of a chemotherapeutic drug and a steroid hormone, and 
oral administration or injection of butyrophenones or 
serotonin antagonists have been practiced. However, massive 
dose therapy of metoclopramide and use of a steroid hormone 
in combination with other drugs are not very much useful 
because they involve drawbacks that antiemetic action is 
weak, and in addition, adverse side effects are caused. On 
the other hand , serotonin antagonists, which has recently 
been developed, causes less adverse side effects, but their 
antiemetic  
 
action is still unsatisfactory. Since vomiting caused by anti-cancer drugs occurs not 
only during the period of drug administration but also 
during the suspension period of drugs, the antiemetic effect 
must last long enough. Conventional antiemetics, however, 
cannot maintain their effect successfully when they are 
dosed once a day. Accordingly, patients are forced to take 
the drugs 3 or even more times a day, or receive intravenous 
drip in a limited number of well-equipped institutions. When a patient has vomiting by the use of an anti-cancer 
drug, antiemetics are hardly administered via oral 
route due to vomiting, and therefore, their effect cannot be 
expected. On the other hand, since chemotherapeutic drugs 
against cancer are generally administered by injection, 
further injection of antiemetics will bring more suffering 
to patients, and in addition, such injection involves 
limitation because it will not be performed in the home 
treatment. Butyrophenones have already been used as a psychotropic 
drug. They have also been used, in the forms of oral or 
injection preparations, for preventing vomiting which occurs 
during use of anti-cancer drugs and have exhibited good 
results. They are, however, accompanied by a shortcoming of 
causing extrapyramidal side effect. Butyrophenones have a 
narrow range of concentrations in which the side effect and
