<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a mask (7) for covering the radially outer region of a disc-shaped substrate surface during a coating process, for example a sputtering or vapour deposition process in vacuo, the mask (7) is produced from an elastic material and designed as a flat plate having at least one essentially circular opening. For the purpose of centring and locking the mask on the substrate (1), in the opening there is provided a concentric, annular surface which takes over the actual masking function and extends in a plane parallel to the plane of the plate and onto which the substrate (1) can be placed with its one side which is to be coated. Provided on the outer wall of the opening at a constant spacing from this surface are clamping pieces which are to extend radially inwards and bear against the other side of the substrate (1).

Mask (7) for covering the radially outer region of an 
outer surface of a disc-like substrate (1) during a 

coating process, for example a sputtering or vacuum 
metallising process, characterised in that the mask 

(7) is manufactured from a resilient material and is 
formed as a plane plate with at least one circular 

recess (14), wherein for centring and locking of the 
mask (7) on the substrate (1) the substrate abuts in a 

sealing-tight manner with its radial circumferential 
face the wall part (14a) of the mask (7) formed by the 

recess (14), wherein on this wall part (14a) a 
concentric, circular face (9) is provided which 

extends radially inward in a plane parallel to the 
substrate plane and on to which the substrate (1) can 

be placed with one of its lateral faces to be coated, 
wherein on the wall part (14a) of the mask (7) formed 

by the recess (14), at a constant distance (11) from 
the face (9), radially inwardly extending tongues or 

projections (10, 10', ...) are formed, which abut the 
other lateral face of the substrate (1). 
Mask according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
mask (7) is manufactured from plastics material or 

metal. 
Mask according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
circular recess (14) is formed as a hole. 
Mask according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
distance between the planes of the face (9) and the 

tongues or projections (10, 10', ...) corresponds to 
the substrate thickness. 
Mask according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
tongues or projections (10, 10', ...) are distributed  

 
evenly around the circumference of the circular 

aperture (14). 
Mask according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
diametral distance (12) between the radially inner 

edges of the tongues or projections (10, 10', ...) in 
the plane state of the mask (7) is smaller than the 

substrate diameter (13). 
Mask device, characterised in that it consists of two 
masks (7, 21) according to claim 1, which are 

assembled back to back. 
Mask according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
mask (23) has two or more circular recesses (14) for 

receiving the substrates (24, 24', 24''). 
System comprising a mask according to claim 1 and a 
substrate, characterised in that the mask (7) is 

locked to the substrate (1) and both parts together 
are movable through a vacuum chamber (8). 
Method of covering the radially outer region of a 
disc-shaped substrate surface during a coating process 

in the course of vapour deposition or sputtering in a 
processing chamber by means of a mask, characterised 

in that the mask (7) according to claims 1 to 9 
cooperates with a fixed stop (18) of an annular 

abutment (16) of a bending device, wherein the mask 
(7) locked on to the substrate (1) completes a tilting 

movement out of the substrate plane, to which end the 
mask (7) is movable by a pressure member (15) of the 

bending device against the stop (18) of the abutment 
(16), and the pressure member (15) acts on the 

under-side of the radially inner edge of the mask (7), 
whilst simultaneously the fixed stop (18) of the  

 
bending device must abut the radially outer, upper 

edge of the mask (7). 
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the stop (18) of the annular abutment (16) and the 

movable pressure member (15) of the bending device are 
disposed concentrically to one another. 
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that 

the inner diameter of the fixed stop (18) of the 
abutment (16) is larger than the outer diameter of the 

movable pressure member (15). 
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the mask (7) is placed on the pressure member (15) and 

is moved with the pressure member (15) so far towards 
the stop (18) that the diametral distance (12) between 

the tonges or projections (10, 10', ...) is greater 
than the substrate diameter (13).
