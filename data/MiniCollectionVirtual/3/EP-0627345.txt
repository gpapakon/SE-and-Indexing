<ABSTRACT>
The safety belt retractor has, in conventional fashion, a locking mechanism which is sensitive to the vehicle and a release mechanism having a disc cam (64) which is connected to the belt reel (12) and the rotation of which can be stopped by means of an inertial sensor (71, 71a, 73a, 75a) which is sensitive to the vehicle. A belt tightening drive engages on the first axial end of a torque rod (30), the second end of which is coupled to the belt reel (12) in a mounted manner. When the belt has been tightened, the former end of the torque rod (30) is locked against the casing (10) in a non-rotating manner, and the torque rod (30) is twisted about its axis in an energy-absorbing manner under the load which is subsequently imparted via the belt. The disc cam (64) is connected to the belt reel (12) via a coupling (60, 62, 68, 74, 78; 92 to 106) which limits the torque.

A seat belt retractor having a belt reel (12) rotatably 
mounted in a housing (10) and a belt tensioner drive (18, 

19, 20) for rotating the belt reel (12) in the take-up 
direction, an axial end of a torsion bar (30) being 

connected non-rotatably to the belt reel (12) and the 
torsion bar (30), after belt tensioning has taken place, 

being blocked non-rotatably in withdrawal direction on the 
housing (10) due to a blocking mechanism (32, 34, 40, 44, 

46) and under load being able to be twisted between its 
axial ends due to rotation of the belt reel (12), characterized 

in that the belt tensioner drive (18, 19, 20) engages 
at the other axial end of the torsion bar (30) and in that 

the blocking mechanism (32, 34, 40, 44, 46) comprises a pawl 
coupling (32, 34, 40). 
Safety belt retractor according to claim 1, comprising a 
vehicle-sensitive locking mechanism (16, 64, 71a, 73a, 75a) 

provided with a control disk (64) which is rotabable in 
limited manner relatively to the belt reel (12), a locking 

toothing (11) on the belt reel (12) and a locking pawl (16), 
characterized in that the control disk (64) is connected to 

said belt reel (12) via a torque-limiting coupling (60, 62, 
68, 74, 78; 92 through 106).  

 
Safety belt retractor according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the coupling is formed by a first toothing (62, 92) 

provided on the belt reel (12) and a second toothing (68, 
100) coupled to the control disk (64), said second toothing 

being held engaged with the first toothing (62, 92) by 
spring force. 
Safety belt retractor according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterized in that the control disk (64) is spring loaded 

in the axial direction with respect to said belt reel (12) 
and said first toothing and said second toothing are each 

formed by a spur gear toothing (62, 68). 
Safety belt retractor according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the control disk (64) is mounted to be axially 

shiftable on a pin (74) firmly connected to said belt reel 
(12) and a spring (78) is tensioned between a widened end 

(76) of said pin (74) and said control disk (64) to spring-load 
said control disk (64) in an axial direction. 
Safety belt retractor according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterized in that said belt reel (12) is provided with 

an outer toothing (92) which is engaged by an inner toothing 
(100) of said control disk (64), which toothing is spring-loaded 

substantially in radial direction and is swivable 
outwardly. 
Safety belt retractor according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the tensioner drive 

comprises: 

a pulley (20), the circumference of which is engaged by a 
pulling cable (18); 
a ratchet wheel (22) coupled non-rotatably to the pulley 
(20) and at the circumference of which at least one coupling 

pawl (24) is mounted which can be swiveled outwardly; and  
 
a coupling wheel (32a) coupled non-rotatably to the first 
axial end of said torsion bar (30), which is assigned to 

said belt tensioner drive, and provided with a coupling 
toothing in which the coupling pawl (24) can be engaged 

selectively. 
Safety belt retractor according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the blocking 

mechanism comprises: 

a ratchet wheel (32) coupled non-rotatably to the first 
axial end of the torsion rod (30) and at the circumference 

of which at least one blocking pawl (34) is mounted so that 
it can be swiveled outwardly; and 
a ring (40) supported at the housing (10) and provided 
with a locking toothing in which a blocking pawl can be 

selectively engaged. 
Safety belt retractor according to claim 7 and claim 8, 
characterized in that the coupling wheel (32a) connected

(16) and holds said pawl out of engagement with the locking 
toothing (11) of the belt reel (12) when the ring (40) is
