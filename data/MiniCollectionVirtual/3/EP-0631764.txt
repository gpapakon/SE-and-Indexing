<ABSTRACT>
The tibial part of a knee joint endoprosthesis comprises a tibial 
plateau (4) made of metal, a plastic 

insert (6) on the tibial plateau and an anchoring element (8) on 
the lower side of the tibial plateau. 
In order to 
increase the stability of the anchorage in the tibial 

bone, the anchoring element is designed in such a way 
that the diameter (d) of the largest circle inscribed in the horizontal 

cross section of the anchoring element directly beneath 
the tibial plateau 

is at least half the radius (R) of the largest 
circle inscribed on the tibial plateau.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the tibial part of a knee joint 
endoprosthesis, comprising a tibial plateau made of 
metal, a plastic insert on the tibial plateau and an 
anchoring element on the lower side of the tibial 
plateau. Such a tibial part is known from German Patent 3,433,264 
and is used at the proximal end of the human tibial bone 
that has first been resected appropriately. It serves as 
the support for a corresponding femoral part of a knee 
joint endoprosthesis that is implanted at the distal end 
of the human femur bone. With this known design, a 
slender anchoring shaft element is arranged on the 
underside of the tibial plateau (facing the bone) and is 
composed of two parts. This anchoring element is 
provided in order to secure the position and anchoring of 
the tibial part. The lower side of the tibial plateau 
and the anchoring elements have an open-celled or open-pored 
surface structure that allows the adjacent bony 
tissue to grow into the pores or cells that are 
accessible from the surface. This bony ingrowth gives an 
additional anchoring effect for the tibial part beneath 
the tibial plateau in the adjacent bony tissue. Since the tibial part rests on the resected tibial bone 
forces acting vertically such as the weight of the body 
are transmitted to the adjacent bony tissue, especially 
the corticalis. It is necessary that care be taken to 
assure that transverse forces acting in the knee will 
also be absorbed well in order to assure that the tibial 
part will be secured adequately. In this regard, a 
disadvantage of this known embodiment has proven to be  
 
the very small horizontal projected area of the anchoring 
part, especially directly beneath the tibial plateau, 
which can absorb the transverse forces only to an 
inadequate extent. The object of this invention is to improve the tibial 
part of the type described initially such that an 
improved anchoring is achieved, especially in order to 
effectively absorb transverse forces. This problem is solved according to this invention due to 
the fact that the cross-sectional area of a first section 
of the anchoring element has a radial extent directly 
beneath the tibial plateau such that the diameter d of 
the largest circle that can be described on the tibial 
plateau corresponds at least to half the radius R of the 
largest circle that can be described on the tibial 
plateau. The advantages of this invention include especially the 
fact that a large surface area is achieved due to the 
large radial extent of the anchoring
