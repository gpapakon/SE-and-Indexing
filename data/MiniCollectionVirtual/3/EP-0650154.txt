<ABSTRACT>
A self-adhesive label comprising a multilaminar label 
portion (64), a self-adhesive laminar material (72) extending over, 

and adhered by its self-adhesive surface to, the 
multilaminar label portion thereby to form two self-adhesive 

edge portions (72,74) thereof on opposed sides of the multilaminar 
label portion, and a backing (66) of release material to which 

the two edge portions are releasably adhered by a 
self-adhesive rear surface thereof and to which the 

multilaminar label portion is releasably adhered by a layer 
of pressure-sensitive adhesive (68). There is also provided a 

method for producing such a label.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-adhesive label and
to a method of producing a succession of self-adhesive labels
carried on a backing of release material.This application is divided from European Patent Application
No. 91915912.9 published as EP-A-0546047 which discloses and
claims a self-adhesive label and a method of producing a
succession of self-adhesive labels carried on a backing of
release material.WO-A-90/05631 discloses a self-adhesive label having the
features of the pre-characterising portion of claim 1 and also
a method of producing such a label. GB-A-2199010 discloses a
method of producing self-adhesive labels by applying sheets to
a layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive on a backing of release
material, adhering a laminar material to the upper surface of the
sheets, cutting out the self-adhesive labels from the laminar
material and the sheets to form self-adhesive labels and removing
the waste surrounding the labels.A number of self-adhesive multilaminar labels are known.
These labels can suffer from the disadvantage that they can be
difficult for a user to open when the self-adhesive label is
adhered to a product.The present invention provides a self-adhesive label
comprising a multilaminar label portion, a self-adhesive laminar
material extending over, and adhered by its self-adhesive surface
to, the multilaminar label portion thereby to form two self-adhesive
edge portions thereof on opposed sides of the
multilaminar label portion, and a backing of release material to
which the self-adhesive label is adhered, characterised in that
the two edge portions are directly releasably adhered by a self-adhesive
rear surface thereof to the backing of release material
and the multilaminar label portion is directly releasably adhered
by a layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive to the backing of
release material.The present invention also provides a method of producing 
a succession of self-adhesive labels carried on a backing of
release material, the method comprising the steps of:- (a)
directly releasably adhering a succession of multilaminar label
portions to a backing of release material by a layer of pressure-sensitive
adhesive; (b) applying a self-adhesive laminar material
over the succession of multilaminar label portions and the
backing of release material, the laminar material being adhered
directly thereto by the self-adhesive surface thereof; and (c)
cutting through the laminar material and the multilaminar label
portions thereby to form the self-adhesive labels, each self-adhesive

<CLAIMS>
A self-adhesive label comprising a multilaminar label
portion (64), a self-adhesive laminar material (72) extending

over, and adhered by its self-adhesive surface to, the
multilaminar label portion (64) thereby to form two self-adhesive

edge portions (72,74) thereof on opposed sides of the
multilaminar label portion (64), and a backing (66) of release

material to which the self-adhesive label is adhered,

characterised in that
 the two edge portions (72,74) are directly
releasably adhered by a self-adhesive rear surface thereof to the

backing (66) of release material and the multilaminar label
portion (64) is directly releasably adhered by a layer of

pressure-sensitive adhesive (68) to the backing (66) of release
material.
A self-adhesive label according to claim 1 wherein one of
the edge portions (74) has an unadhered flap (75) which may be

pulled to release the said one edge portion (74) thereby to open
the multilaminar label portion (64).
A self-adhesive label according to claim 2 wherein the
unadhered flap (75) comprises a patch (76) of non-adhesive

material which coats the self-adhesive surface of the laminar
material (72).
A self-adhesive label according to claim 3 wherein the patch
(76) is comprised of ink.
A method of producing a succession of self-adhesive labels
(62) carried on a backing of release material, the method

comprising the steps of:-

(a) directly releasably adhering a succession of
multilaminar label portions (64) to a backing (66) of release

material by a layer (68) of pressure-sensitive adhesive;
(b) applying a self-adhesive laminar material (70) over the 
succession of multilaminar label portions (64) and the backing

(66) of release material, the laminar material (70) being adhered
directly thereto by the self-adhesive surface thereof; and
(c) cutting through the laminar material (70) and the
multilaminar label portions (64) thereby to form the self-adhesive

labels (62), each self-adhesive label (62) including two
edge portions (72,74) of the laminar material (42) on opposed

sides of the multilaminar label portion (64), which edge portions
(72,74) are directly adhered to the backing (66) of release

material.
A method according to claim 5 further comprising the step,
before, during or after step (a) of applying a succession of

patches (76) of non-adhesive material to the backing (66) of
release material.
A method according to claim 6 wherein the patch (76) is
printed onto the backing (66) of release material.
A method according to claim 7 wherein the patch (76) is
composed of ink.
