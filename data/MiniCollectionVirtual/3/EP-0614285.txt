data into analog form includes a reference voltage 

source, a ground path, a tapped shift register for 
shifting the single bit digital input data, an 

operational amplifier having a feedback resistor 
therearound, and a discrete electronic element connected 

at one end to the operational amplifier. The circuit 
also includes structure, responsive to the single bit 

digital input data as it is being shifted through the 
shift register, for connected another end of the discrete 

electronic element to either the reference voltage source 
or to ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and 
apparatus for digital signal processing. More 
Particularly, the present invention relates to digital-to-analog 
converters and finite impulse response ("FIR") 
filters. Digital-to-analog converters ("DAC's") have come to 
be commonly employed in digital audio applications, such 
as those involving compact disk ("CD") players, digital 
audio tape ("DAT") players, and the like. Additionally, 
DAC's are being incorporated into personal computers 
("PC's") to provide them with audio capability. For 
example, some effort has been expended to include audio 
capabilities on PC motherboards. Needless to say, a large dynamic range is a desired 
characteristic of audio equipment. Those skilled in the 
digital signal processing art have learned that the 
greater the number of bits that a DAC can accept with 
linearity (i.e., in a manner so that the change in the 
value of one quantity is directly proportional to the 
change in the value of another quantity), the better the 
dynamic range of the player or "reproduction equipment" 
involved. Conventionally, DAC's derive analog signals from 
digital data by parallel processing; that is, all or 
substantial portions of the bits comprising the digital 
representation of an analog signal sample are used  
 
substantially simultaneously to recreate the analog 
signal sample. A shortcoming and deficiency of this 
approach is that the more bits employed in a DAC, the 
harder it is to keep production costs low and the harder 
it is to maintain desired processing characteristics 
(e.g., linearity). To address the foregoing problems and deficiencies, 
those skilled in the art have developed so-called 
"oversampling" techniques. By employing these 
techniques, a DAC using only a very few bits (most often, 
one bit), at a very high rate, can achieve a performance 
level equivalent to a DAC having more bits, but operating 
at a lower rate. Oversampling apparatus and circuits, in part, 
convert parallel digital data into a single, high rate, 
digital bit stream. The portion of oversampling 
apparatus that perform this conversion are called delta-sigma 
converters. They are also called "noise-shapers" 
and "interpolative modulators". A drawback of conventional delta-sigma converters is 
the fact that they introduce a significant amount of 
noise into the conversion process, particularly at higher 
frequencies. To reduce the amount of noise introduced at 
lower frequencies, those skilled in the art have 
heretofore constructed
