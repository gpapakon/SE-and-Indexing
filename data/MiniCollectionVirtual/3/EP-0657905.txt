<ABSTRACT>
This is a cassette of the type including, on the one hand, a body (19), which forms the accommodation (22) for the electrical component in question, and which is equipped with fastening means (23A) suitable for interacting with complementary fastening means (23B) provided for this purpose in the casing (11), and, on the other hand, an arm (24) which, integral with the body (19), extends in cantilever fashion from the latter, and which, is itself equipped with fastening means (23'A) suitable for interacting with complementary fastening means (23'B) provided in the casing (11). According to the invention, the fastening means (23'A) of the arm (24), which are of the same type as those (23A) of the body (19), are situated in a position which is diagonally opposite with respect to the latter. Application, particularly, to making up single or double two-way switches.

<CLAIMS>
A case for housing an electrical component in a casing (11) of 
the kind comprising on the one hand a body (19) which itself forms the 

housing (22) for the electrical component in question and which is 
provided with fixing means (23A) capable of co-operating with 

complementary fixing means (23B) provided for that purpose in the casing 
(11) and on the other hand an arm (24) which, fixed with respect to the 

body (19), extends in cantilever relationship therefrom and which is 
also provided with fixing means (23'A) capable of co-operating with 

complementary fixing means (23'B) provided in the casing (11) 
characterised in that the fixing means (23'A) of the arm (24), which are 

of the same type as those (23A) of the body (19), are disposed in a 
diagonally opposite position with respect thereto. 
A case according to claim 1 characterised in that parallel to 
the arm (24) the body (19), along its side opposite thereto, is of a 

dimension (D1) substantially equal to the length (D2) of the arm (24). 
A case according to either one of claims 1 and 2 characterised 
in that, the body (19) being in the general shape of a plate portion, 

the arm (24) extends substantially level with one of its main faces. 
A case according to claim 2 characterised in that the upper 
face of the arm (24) is substantially level with the lower face of the 

body (19). 
A case according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that in plan the body (19) is of an overall quadrangular contour and the 

arm (24) extends parallel to one of its sides, from one of its angles. 
A case according to any one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in 
that the arm (24) is of a thickness (E2) which is less than the 

thickness (E1) of the body (19).  
 
A case according to any one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in 
that, by co-operation in respect of shape between the body (19) and the 

arm (24), it is capable of being associated in mutually reversed 
relationship with an identical case. 
A case according to claim 7 characterised in that complementary 
latching means are provided on the body (19) and the arm (24). 
A case according to claim 8 characterised in that said latching 
means comprise on the body (19) at least one hook (33) and at a 

corresponding position on the arm (24) at least one groove (35) with 
which the hook (33) on the body (19) of the associated case can come 

into engagement. 
A case according to claim 9 characterised in that the hook (33) 
extends in full surface relationship for the body (19) and the groove 

(35) extends along the edge of the arm (24). 
A case according to any one of claims 7 to 10 characterised in 
that, when it is associated with an identical case, its arm (24) extends 

on the same face of its body (19) as the arm (24) of the case with which 
it is associated. 
A case according to any one of claims 7 to 11 characterised in 
that, when it is associated with an identical case, the fixing means 

(23A) of its body (19) are in superposed relationship with those (23'A) 
of the arm (24) of the case with which it is associated. 
A case according to any one of claims 7 to 12 characterised in 
that its arm (24) comprises an edge portion (26) at its free end. 
A case according to any one of claims 1 to 13 characterised in 
that the fixing means (23A) of its body (19) are formed by a simple lug, 

and the same applies for those (23'A) of its arm (24).  
 
A case according to any one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in 
that its body (19) comprises at the base of its arm (24) at the 

connection thereto a hole (28) which passes entirely through it. 
A case according to any one of claims 1 to 15 characterised in 
that its arm (24) has no other function than to present fixing means 

(23'A) at its end. 
A case according to any one of claims 1 to 16 characterised in 
that its arm (24) is reduced overall to a beam portion.
