<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
memory apparatus. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a sliding type magnetic
head assembly for use in an external memory apparatus
of an electronic computer; a magnetic memory apparatus
and a magneto-optical recording/reproducing apparatus,
used as a recording/reproducing apparatus for music,
video signals and other information.Conventionally, a magnetic head of a sliding
type has been mainly used for recording on magnetic
tapes and flexible magnetic disks. In recent years, a
mini disk (hereinafter, referred to as "MD") has been
popularized as a magneto-optical information storage
medium for storing music data. The MD includes a
sliding film and needs a sliding type magnetic head.
The sliding type magnetic head realizes an overwrite
operation by modulating magnetic fields.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 4-132060
discloses a sliding type magnetic head for
magneto-optical recording. The magnetic head slides on
a storage medium at the start and end of the disk
rotation. The magnetic head includes a slider whose
bottom surface is flat. The bottom surface is made of
a resin having lubricative properties and excellent
abrasion resistance, so as to prevent the magnetic
head slider and the magneto-optical information storage
medium from being abraded and damaged. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 55-22296
discloses a suspension applicable to the conventional
magnetic head. The suspension includes a gimbal
for allowing the slider to follow the surface of the
rotating disk and a load beam for generating a load to
press the slider on the disk.During the process for assembling the conventional
magnetic head, several problems have arisen: the
first one is that the load beam and the gimbal should
be welded by a spot welding, and the gimbal and the
slider should be bonded together; and the second one is
that a precise locational restriction between the
gimbal and the slider is required to maintain their
mechanism, and also between the slider and the load
beam via the gimbal to maintain the locational precision
of a magnetic core.Thus, the fabrication of the gimbal is extremely
costly because it requires precise processing,
resulting in a rise in the cost of the magnetic head
assembly. Furthermore, the load beam requires a bending
process for producing a rigid part and precise
control of the deformation process to provide an appropriate
load, also resulting in a rise in the cost of
the magnetic head assembly.JP-A-5 144 115 relates to a
