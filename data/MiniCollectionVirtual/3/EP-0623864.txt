<ABSTRACT>
A system controller (32) monitors certain parameters 
for the purpose of exercising supervisory control over 

a number of discrete chiller units (10, 12, 14) each 
having individual dedicated controls (26, 28, 30). 

The supervisory controller (32) imposes limits on the 
amount of compression that can be demanded by the 

individual dedicated control units (26, 28, 30). 
These limits are selectively changed when certain 

parameters pertaining to the collective chilling 
capacity of all of the active chiller units (10, 12, 

14) exceed or fall below acceptable levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the simultaneous control of several
individual chiller units within a system that is processing
chilled coolant via common supply and return lines. In
particular, this invention relates to the control of a number
of different chiller units each having their own respective
dedicated control units.Multiple chillers on a common coolant loop are subjected to
the same entering coolant temperature at approximately the
same time. The chillers are typically required to maintain
the leaving coolant at the same temperature. This causes the
individual units to simultaneously start or stop their
compressors at the same time. This leads to unnecessary and
at times excessive demands on electrical power consumption and
excessive compressor cycling in order to provide the chilling
of the coolant perceived to be necessary. In this regard,
each individual chiller unit having its own particular
compressor stages and control unit is trying to activate the
perceived number of compressor stages necessary to achieve the
desired chilling without regard to what may be happening
elsewhere. This often produces an over reaction.EP-A-0204521 discloses a system in which a controller issues a
load signal to a heating/cooling source to instruct it
positively to load (or unload) a compressor stage, and in
which the sources are brought on-line one at a time, the
controller sending a load signal to a first source to
successively load the stages of that source until the source
reaches full load, and then sending a load signal to a second
source after the first source is fully loaded.US-A-4483152 discloses a system in which a controller
activates selected individual compressor stages from any of
the chillers of the system in accordance with a database of
detected efficiencies. The present invention aims to provide a control system which
allows individually controlled units to provide normal control
functions while at the same time monitoring and controlling
these individual chiller units when necessary so as to
maintain the leaving coolant temperature at a predefined
level.The present invention provides a process as claimed in claim
1. The process imposes demand limits on individual chiller
control units whereby the individual units cannot simply
activate or deactivate compressor stages. In the event that
the capacity demands placed on the individual units need to be
exceeded, the overall control system selects which individual
units are to receive changes in demand limits so as to thereby
allow an increase or
