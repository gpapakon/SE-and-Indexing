<ABSTRACT>
A wave transmitter covers a predetermined spatial sensing field and a reflected wave receiver controls an automatic device such as an automatic door. A radiating antenna with an elongate body has a number of radiating elements arranged lengthwise along the elongate body, each of said radiating elements being sized and arranged so that the antenna radiates in planes which are substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the elongate body. Said radiating antenna advantageously provides sensing in a preferred direction. In one embodiment, the antenna consists of a slotted waveguide having slots on one side surface thereof and a wave transceiver at one end of the waveguide. The slots are arranged at a predetermined angle, preferably alternately in one direction and in the opposite direction so that the radiated waves are in phase. The slot angle may vary along the antenna, either between individual slots or between groups of slots or elements.

An electronic device for sensing and protection of 
persons and/or objects in the immediate environment of 

an automatic device, which device for sensing and protection 
comprises a wave transmitter covering a 

determined spatial sensing field and a wave receiver 
controlling an automatic device, characterised in that 

it furthermore comprises a radiating antenna consisting 
of a slotted waveguide (110) which has lateral faces, 

the slots (120) being arranged on one of the lateral 
faces in order to form the aforesaid radiating 

elements, and the placement of which is determined in 
such a way that the antenna radiates in planes which 

are virtually perpendicular to the longitudinal direction 
of the waveguide, 


a wave transmitter/receiver arranged at one end of the 
waveguide and a matched load arranged at the opposite 

end, 
substantially identical reflectors (160, 161) arranged 
virtually over the whole length of the waveguide, these 

reflectors extending virtually symmetrically with respect 
to the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the 

guide while making a predetermined angle with one 
another, the waveguide (110) and the reflectors (160, 

161) being extruded in one or two pieces. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that one of the pieces forms the radiating face (111) 

of the waveguide and is fabricated from a metal strip 
drilled with slots or from a metallized epoxy substrate 

in which the slots have been photoengraved. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that one of the pieces forms the casing of the sensor, 

the main part of the waveguide and the reflectors.  
 
The device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the reflectors (160, 161) are 

arranged so as to be able to pivot about an axis parallel 
to the longitudinal axis of the waveguide (110). 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the inclination of the radiating elements varies 

over the length of the waveguide. 
The device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the variation in the inclination of the radiating 

elements takes place per group of several elements.
