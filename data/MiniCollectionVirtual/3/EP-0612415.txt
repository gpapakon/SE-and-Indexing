<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides optical modulators which comprise aligned chiral smectic liquid crystal cells within an optical resonance cavity. The cavity configurations include symmetric and asymmetric Fabry-Perot etalons. The liquid crystal cells can be planar- or homeotropically-aligned and can be discrete state or analogue cells. The device configurations of the present invention provide discrete or continuous optical modualtion of the phase, intensity, and wavelength of elliptically polarized light, without requiring polarization analyzers. The modulators are optically or electronically addressable in single pixels or arrays of multiple pixels. Certain homeotropically-aligned cells are provided as an aspect of this invention, as are certain variable retarders comprised of planar-aligned cells in combination with birefringent elements. For example, the figure T shown includes a photo sensitive layer (110), reflective surfaces (113-114), a wave plate (112) and a chiral smetic liquid crystal (111).

/CHIRAL SMECTIC LIQUID CRYSTAL OPTICAL MODULATORSField of the Invention 5 The present invention relates to tunable electro- optical modulators having a folded optical path structure using chiral smectic liquid crystal materials as tuning elements and, in particular, relates to Fabry-Perot interferometer and etalon modulators.10 Background of the InventionLiquid crystal devices operate on the basic principle that due to the dielectric anisotropy of nematic, cholesteric and smectic liquid crystals, the average molecular axis, or director, can be oriented in the15 presence of an applied electric field. The coupling of non-ferroelectric liquid crystals to the applied field is a weak, second order interaction. In general, slow response times are characteristic of non-ferroelectric, non-chiral, liquid crystal optical devices.20 Meyer et al. ("Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals", in LeJournal de Physique, Vol. 36, March, 1975, pp. L69-L71) showed that chiral C* or H*, smectic liquid crystals, could be ferroelectric, that is, possess a permanent electric dipole density, P. This permanent polarization, P, is25 perpendicular to the average orientation of the long axis of the molecules (denoted by the molecular director, n,) and generally contained within a plane parallel to the smectic layers. In these chiral smectic liquid crystals (CSLCs) , the molecular director makes a temperature 

 dependent angle, Ψ, with respect to the layer normal, ς ' shown in Figures 1 and 2. In general, Ψ ranges from 0° to 45°. The presence of the eiectric dipole provides a much stronger coupling to the applied electric field as compared to non-ferroelectric liquid crystals. Furthermore, the coupling, and hence aligning torque is about linear with applied field. The significance of this is that changing the sign of the applied electric field will change the direction of P in smectic C*, H*, A* and other chiral smectic phase liquid crystals.N. A. Clark et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,367,924, realized a ferroelectric liquid crystal switching device by sandwiching a thin layer of a smectic C* (SmC*) liquid crystal between two glass plates coated with transparent electrodes. In this patent, they describe the surface- stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) device, which employs SmC* or SmH* liquid crystal phases in the so- called bookshelf geometry, otherwise designated the planar alignment, where the smectic layers are perpendicular to and the liquid crystal molecules are parallel to the glass plates which also contain the electrodes, as
