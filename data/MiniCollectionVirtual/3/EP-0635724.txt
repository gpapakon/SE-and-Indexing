<ABSTRACT>
A motor assembly 
(A)
 cyclically moves a sample 

(34)
 longitudinally through the longitudinally aligned 
central bores 
(16, 18)
 of a pair of hollow electrodes 
(12, 
14)
. One of the electrodes 
(14)
 is connected with a 
Faraday shield 
(10)
 which electrically shields the 
electrodes and the sample and the other electrode 
(12)
 is 
electrically insulated from the Faraday shield. 

Preferably, the Faraday shield structure further serves as 
a hermetic seal for sealing the hollow electrodes against 

adverse effects of the ambient atmosphere. An electrical 
instrument 
(C)
 is connected across the two hollow 
electrodes to measure the induced charge transfer or 

potential difference as the sample cyclically moves back 
and forth between the hollow bores of the two electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification relates to the art of 
electrical potential determination. It finds particular 
application in determining true or absolute potential and 
measuring other electrostatic potentials on an absolute 
scale. It is to be appreciated that the present proposals 
are applicable to monitoring potential and change in 
potential relative to a standard or absolute potential 
reference. The potential of earth-ground or other objects, 
such as aircraft, fluid or grain containers, chemical 
reaction tanks, hospital patients, and the like may be 
measured. Historically, voltage measuring devices required 
two different electrostatic potentials in order to produce 
a measurement. It has been considered a common convenience 
and practical convention for engineers and scientists to 
use the Earth as a common reference point when measuring 
single point sources of potential. Earth-ground is 
arbitrarily assigned a zero potential. A convenient common 
reference for voltage measurements is provided by a metal 
rod driven into the ground, a connection to a metallic 
water pipe, a connection to a power line common ground 
wire, or the like. There are inherent inaccuracies resultant from 
measuring potential with reference to earth-ground. The 
potential of the Earth changes with time and location. 
Telluric currents flow along the Earth on both land and 
water. Telluric currents result from storms, time-varying  
 
electromagnetic induction, and other natural and man-made 
causes. Thus, the potential of earth-ground varies with 
location on the surface of the Earth and with time. Further, solar wind and energetic charged 
particles, often associated with sunspots, periodically 
flow over and immerse the Earth. Exposure of the Earth to 
a varying flux of charged particles can also be expected to 
alter the absolute potential of the Earth. Within the atmosphere, the Earth is more negative 
than the surrounding atmosphere, which surrounding 
atmosphere in turn has an altitude-dependent potential 
difference relative to the Earth. That is, the potential 
difference across the atmosphere of the Earth is about 
400,000 volts. The potential difference tends to vary most 
quickly adjacent the Earth with a voltage variation on the 
order of 75 to 250 volts per meter. Pollution, humidity, 
snow, rain, and other atmospheric events cause variations 
in this potential difference. Electronic equipment in an aircraft is commonly 
grounded to the metal frame of the airplane and other 
vehicles. However, aircraft with
