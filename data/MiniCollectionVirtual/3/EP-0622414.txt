<ABSTRACT>
A composition mainly comprising polybutylene terephthalate, and also containing a halobenzyl acrylate resin having repeated 
halobenzyl acrylate or methacrylate units and phosphonic acid or a monoester thereof. The composition may further contain 

a polytetrafluoroethylene resin, an ethylene copolymer and an inorganic filler as optional components. The composition is 
capable of a reduction in the amount of volatile decomposition gas generated in the melt molding step and an improvement in the 

fluidity, thus shortening the cycle of producing molded articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame-retardant 
polyester resin composition. More 
specifically, it relates to a flame-retardant polyester 
resin composition from which very little volatiles to 
contaminate metals are generated and which is excellent 
in moldability (flowability, rigidity at high-temperature, 
high-cycle molding). Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 
3682/1977 discloses a process for producing a flame-retardant 
polyester resin, which comprises 
incorporating a halogen-containing benzyl acrylate or 
benzyl methacrylate polymer into a polyester resin. Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 
6248/1984 discloses a polyester resin composition 
containing a thermoplastic polyester resin, a halogen-containing 
acrylic resin obtained by the polymerization 
of a halogen-containing benzyl acrylate or methacrylate 
of the following formula (1), 
   wherein X is a halogen atom, n is an integer 
of 1 to 5 and Z is a hydrogen atom or a 
methyl group,
 
and a hindered phenol compound. Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 
20350/1984 discloses a polyester resin composition 
obtained by incorporating the same halogen-containing 
acrylic resin as the above halogen-containing acrylic 
resin and a thioether compound into a thermoplastic  
 
polyester resin. Further, Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Publication No. 20351/1984 discloses a polyester resin 
composition which is the same as the composition 
disclosed in above Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Publication No. 20350/1984 except that the thioether is 
replaced with at least one selected from the group 
consisting of phosphoric acid metal salt, phosphorous 
acid metal salt, hypophosphorous acid metal salt and 
organic phosphorous acid ester. The above Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Publications describe that the above polyester resin 
compositions respectively improve the tensile 
elongation and folding endurance of a polyester resin. However, the above hindered phenol compound, 
thioether compound and phosphorus compounds are all 
volatile per se, and it is known that in a point where 
these compounds contact the metal, phosphorus-containing 
compounds, for example, are greatly highly 
corrosive to a metal. These compositions hence cannot 
be said to be satisfactory as base materials for a 
relay and a switch of electric parts obtained by 
assembling parts prepared therefrom. For deceasing the volatiles in melt-molding 
for a molded article, it is important to decrease 
volatiles derived from a polybutylene terephthalate 
base material, and it
