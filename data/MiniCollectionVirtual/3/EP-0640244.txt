<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatuses for 
processing of substrates using radiofrequency induced 
plasma in a plasma chamber. In particular, the 
invention provides apparatuses and methods for 
generating a plasma of a uniform plasma density. Gaseous plasma technology is a well known 
technique used for the fabrication of integrated 
circuits. Parallel plate reactors have been used 
extensively for exciting the gases in the reaction 
chamber to generate the chemical reactions required for 
thin film etching and deposition of wafers. In 
general, when coupling power through an insulator, 
previous hardware setups have used 13.56 MHz as the 
exciting frequency for the gases due to a higher 
excitation efficiency. For instance, see U.S. Patent 
No. 4,948,458 ("Ogle"). In apparatuses such as that shown by 
Ogle, a radiofrequency magnetic field is induced in a 
low pressure reaction chamber by sending a 
radiofrequency resonant current through an external 
planar coil and passing the generated radiofrequency 
energy through a dielectric window in the chamber. The 
magnetic field generates a plasma by causing a 
circulating flux of electrons in a process gas 
introduced into the chamber to produce a region of 
ionic and radical species. The plasma so generated is  
 
used to etch or deposit materials on a wafer in the 
chamber. It has been found that the plasma density 
across the surface area of the wafer is highly variable 
in such apparatuses, with densities measured across 150 
mm and 200 mm wafer areas being as much as two times as 
great in some areas as in others. This non-uniform 
plasma density causes significant non-uniform oxide and 
resist etch rates over measured wafer areas and makes 
it extremely difficult to control critical dimensions 
of fine line geometry on the wafer. Normally, a flat dielectric window is used 
with the apparatuses. It has been observed that the 
magnetic flux of the planar coil is highest near the 
window center and, with a flat window, the induced 
electric field is consequently higher near the window 
center. The apparatuses and methods of the present 
invention utilize a dielectric window having a 
characteristic cross-section, wherein the window is 
thicker at the center and thinner at the edges, to 
decrease the higher induced electric field near the 
window center. An apparatus according to one aspect of the 
present invention includes a housing having a chamber 
in which a wafer can be treated with plasma, the 
housing including at least one inlet port connected to
