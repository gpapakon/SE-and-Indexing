<ABSTRACT>
A carding machine for producing a nonwoven tissue/card sliver is characterized by guiding the fibres along the lower side of the drum (5) and by a waste collecting chamber (2) arranged below the drum and provided with a suction device (4). The drum is equipped with carding elements (22b) and discarding blades (23) substantially located at its lower circumference. The opening drum (7) and taker-in drum (6) are associated to the upper circumference of the drum (5) and are also provided with carding elements (22c, 22b). The supply device (14) at the taker-in drum and the dispensing device (19) at the doffing drum (8) are located at approximately the same level. By guiding the fibres around the lower side of the drum, discarding and in particular evacuating particles of dirt become very simple. The bulky waste collecting chamber (2) allows an uniform suction flow for all dirt discarding elements without affecting the quality of the nonwoven tissue. In addition, the opening drum (7) and the taker-in drum (7) may be arranged at the upper circumference of the drum. A narrow and consequently very compact embodiment is thus obtained.
