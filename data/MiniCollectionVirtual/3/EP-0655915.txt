<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTION- t OF ANGIOTENSIN II ANTAGONISTS FOJ* <TttJs TREATMENT OF HYPERLIPIDAEMETechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a new use of a compound having angiotensin II antagonism.More particularly, the present invention relates to a new use of a compound having angiotensin II antagonism(hereinafter referred to as "angiotensin II antagonist" ) for lowering lipids in living bodies .Disclosure of the InventionAccordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a lipids-lowering agent which comprises an angiotensin II antagonist as an active ingredient.Another object of the present invention is to provide a new use of an angiotensin II antagonist as a lipids-lowering agent.Further object of the present invention is to provide a new use of an angiotensin II antagonist for manufacturing a medicament for treating or preventing lipids-associated diseases and conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperlipemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, atherosclerosis, and the like. 

 Still further object of the present invention is to provide a method for treating or preventing lipids-associated diseases and conditions as mentioned abov which comprises administering an effective amount of an angiotensin II antagonist to a host such as animals including human.It is reported that angiotensin II, which is a kind of hormones existing in living bodies of animals and is mainly produced by angiotensin II converting enzyme from angiotensin I, possesses strong vasoconstrictive action and releasing action for aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Therefore, it is known that an angiotensin II antagonist exhibits vasodilating activity, and is of use for treating hypertension and some heart failures. The inventors of the present invention extensively investigated various effects of the angiotensin II antagonists, and during such investigations, it has been found that an angiotensin II antagonist further exhibits lipids-lowering activity in living bodies of animals, particularly in blood. This finding is really new and is no expectable at all for a person skilled in this field.In the present invention, so-called "lipids" include various cholesterols, particularly high and low density lipoprotein cholesterols (HDL-C, LDL-C), phospholipids, neutral fats (e.g. triglycerides of fatty acids, etc.), and the like. Therefore, according to the present invention, an angiotensin II antagonist is capable of lowering the level of various lipids including the above lipids in living bodies of animals, particularly total
