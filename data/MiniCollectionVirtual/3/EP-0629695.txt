<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel aminopeptidase
and a process for the preparation thereof. More particularly,
it pertains to a novel aminopeptidase separated from a culture
of Streptomycesthermonitrificans; a process for producing
said aminopeptidase by culturing said microorganism; and a
process for preparing a wild-type recombinant protein by using
said aminopeptidase.Aminopeptidases are found in various microorganisms and
animal cells, and generally metallo-proteases requiring a
metal ion such as calcium and zinc for their activities. Said
enzymes are known to be capable of maintaining their
activities of diverse nature, depending on their origin of
derivation, even in a temperature range of 50 to 70°C.Aminopeptidases have their industrial uses in the
determination of protein primary structures, and in the
pharmaceutical drug development etc., and, in particular, they
are useful for the preparation of a recombinant protein having
a same amino acid sequence as its wild-type protein by 
eliminating N-terminal methionine from the recombinant
protein, which is accompanied by methionine in its N-terminal(N-methionyl
recombinant protein), produced in a
microorganism by using a recombinant DNA technique.As the presence of an N-terminal methionine on
recombinant human proteins may cause an unwanted immune
reaction when administered to human beings, it would be
desirable to remove the N-terminal methionine, thus producing
the mature eucaryotic proteins whose primary amino acid
sequences are identical to that of human origin.G. Roncari and H. Zuber disclosed in Method in
Enzymology,19, 544(1970) three aminopeptidases derived from
Bacillusstearothermophilus, having slightly different
properties from each other; and Takayuri Uwajima et al.
reported in Agr. Biol. Chem., 37(12), 2727(1973) the
physicochemical properties of an aminopeptidase requiring a
calcium ion for maintaining its activity, which was derived
from Streptomycespeptidofaciens KY 2389.In addition, various aminopeptidases have been obtained
from, e.g., Bacillussubtilis(Fred W. Wagner et al., Arch.
Biochem. Biophys., 197(1), 63-72(1979)), Streptomycesrimosus
(Lj. Vitale et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 23, 449-455(1986)),
Streptomycesgriseus(K.D. Vosbeck et al., J. Biol.
Chem., 238, 6029-6034(1973), EP Patent Publication No 489711), etc.A. Spungin and S. Blumberg disclosed in Eur. J. Biochem.,
183, 471-477(1989) an aminopeptidase having a molecular weight 
of about 33kd as determined by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal amino
acid sequence of

An aminopeptidase separated from a culture medium of

Streptomyces
thermonitrificans,
 said aminopeptidase

at the N-terminal thereof and amino
acid sequences of Glu-Pro-Gly-Thr-Gly-Ala-Leu-Glu-Pro

and Asn-Pro-Asp-Ile-Val-Tyr at other regions thereof.
The aminopeptidase of claim 1 having an apparent
molecular weight, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate

polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under a reducing
condition, from 41 to 45 kd and an apparent molecular

weight, as determined by gel filtration under a
native state condition, from 36 to 40 kd.

ranging from 30 to 50°C.
A process for preparing an aminopeptidase defined in

the basis of the total weight of the medium.
The process of claim 4 or 5 which further comprises the
steps of:


(A) centrifuging the culture of 
Streptomyces
thermonitrificans

and separating the supernatant therefrom; 
(B) adding ammonium sulfate to the supernatant;
(C) carrying out a triphase partition by adding
tertiary butanol to the supernatant and separating a

clear solution as a lower layer thereof;
(D) adding ammonium sulfate to the clear solution and
repeating said step (C) but separating an intermediate

layer between said tertiary butanol and said aqueous
layers;
(E) subjecting the intermediate layer obtained in said
step (D) to cation exchange chromatography to obtain

fractions containing the aminopeptidase; and
(F) conducting FPLC with respect to the fractions to
obtain the aminopeptidase in a high degree of purity.
The process of claim 6 wherein said ammonium sulfate is

from 35 to 50 % (wt/vol) and from 80
to 90 % (wt/vol), respectively.

FPLC column chromatography is conducted by employing a
