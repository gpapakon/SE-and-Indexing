<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic system comprises an image acquisition unit (1), an image 
coding and recording unit (2) and an image information retrieval unit (9). The image 

acquisition unit (1) acquires moving-image information relating to an object (3) to be 
examined and comprising a series of images which succeed one another in time. The 

image coding and recording unit (2) comprises a first coding unit (4) for converting the 
series of images which succeed one another in time into a first data stream in 

accordance with first conversion rules optimised for the compression of moving-image 
information, and a second coding unit (6) for converting the image information into a 

second data stream in accordance with second conversion rules optimised for the 
compression of still-image information. The average amount of information per coded 

image is smaller for the first coding unit (4) than for the second coding unit (6). The 
image coding and recording unit (2) further comprises a recording unit (7) for recording 

the first and the second data stream on one and the same record carrier. 
 
The image information retrieval unit (9) comprises a read unit (10) for 
reading the data streams from the record carrier (8), a control unit (17), a first decoding 

unit (12) for recovering the image information from the first data stream, a second 
decoding unit (13) for recovering the image information from the second data stream, 

and an image output unit (16) for supplying recovered images to an image reproducing 
device. The control unit (17) controls the read unit (10), the first and the second 

decoding unit (12 and 13), and the image output unit (15). In a first mode the control 
unit (17) is adapted to read a part of the recorded first data stream, to effectuate a 

recovery of the corresponding moving-image information by the first decoding means 
and to effectuate the supply of recovered moving-image information to an image 

reproducing unit (14). In a second mode the control unit (17) effectuates the read-out of 
a selected part of the second data stream, a recovery of the corresponding still-image 

information by the second decoding unit (13) and the supply of this recovered image 
information to the image reproducing unit (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of recording in coded form on a record
carrier image information relating to moving images for the purpose of further analysis
at a later instant, the image information representing moving images in the form of a
series of images which succeed one another in time, said series of images being
converted into a first data stream in which each of the series of succeeding images is
represented, which first data stream is subsequently recorded on the record carrier, the
series of images being converted into a second data stream, and the second data stream
being recorded on the record carrier together with the first data stream.The invention also relates to a diagnostic system using the method.The invention further relates to an image coding and recording unit and an
image information retrieval unit for use in such a system.
The storage of moving images on a record carrier for the purpose of subsequently
examining this image information is known from the SMPTE Journal, Volume 102, No.
7, July 1993, pp. 612-615.Such a method can be used, for example, in so-called cardiovascular diagnosis
where the cardiac function is examined by introducing a contrast medium into a blood
vessel of the heart and subsequently making a series of radiographs to record how this
contrast medium propagates in the blood vessels of the heart as a function of time. The
series of images obtained by means of the radiographs are converted into coded data
streams which are subsequently recorded on a suitable record carrier, for example in the
form of a magnetic or optical tape or disc. The image information thus recorded is read
out and displayed at later instant to analyse the cardiac function. This is effected by
examining moving images and if a further examination of individual images is required
stationary images are displayed. For this purpose it is desirable that each of the
individual images can be displayed selectively as a still image, enabling both preceding
images and subsequent images to be selected. For a correct diagnosis it is desirable that 
the images recovered from the coded information read from the record carrier are of the
same quality as the originally recorded images. This means that the amount of
information to be read out per image is large and, consequently, the data rate (amount
of information per unit of time) with which the information is read should be high. This
high data rate (hereinafter also referred to as "read velocity") imposes stringent
requirements on the read devices
