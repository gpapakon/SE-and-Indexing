<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a diathermy handpiece with endoscopic probe for use in surgical interventions, especially in laparoscopic ultrasound dissections, in which any haemorrhage due to the intervention has to be stopped by sealing the blood vessels. The essential advantage of the present solution resides in the fact that it is possible to permit coagulation and dissection with one apparatus, that is to say, that the sonotrode 8 which accommodates the gas feed line 19 and the suction channel 6 is given an electrically conducting design. The diathermy handpiece can be connected to an endoscopic probe which enhances the applications of this apparatus considerably.
