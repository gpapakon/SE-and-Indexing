<ABSTRACT>
To reduce the noise generated by a gear (1) which has sufficient mechanical strength to transmit even large torques, the proposal is, first of all, to mould a first hub component (1.1) composed of a thermoplastic with a high damping factor and a relatively low mechanical strength on to the transmission shaft (2) of a geared motor and to mould onto this first hub component (1.1) a second hub component (1.2) with an outer gear rim (1.21) composed of a thermoplastic with a high mechanical strength and a relatively low damping factor; to increase the strength, the first hub component (1.1) is moulded onto a metal driver disc (3) fixed on the transmission shaft (2) beforehand or the second hub component (1.2) is anchored to the first hub component (1.1) by having it surround or overlap the latter with a positive fit.

Method for the production of a composite gear 
operating at a low noise level and secured to a shaft, in 

particular a worm gear secured to a transmission shaft of 
a geared motor, characterized in that a first, shaft-side 

hub part (1.1) of the gear (1) composed of a 
thermoplastic with a high damping factor and a relatively 

low mechanical strength and a second, outer hub part 
(1.2) connected to the first hub part (1.1), having a 

toothed rim (1.21) and composed of a thermoplastic of 
high mechanical strength and with a lower damping factor 

are provided, and in that the first hub part (1.1) is 
moulded onto a driving part in such a way as to embed it, 

the driving part having a high mechanical strength and 
being fixed on the shaft (2) in such a way as to give a 

high driving torque and being anchored positively to the 
moulded-on first hub part (1.1). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the driving part is designed as a metal driving 

disc. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the anchoring of the first hub part (1.1) is 

accomplished by injection into notches (3.1) at the rim 
and/or into holes (3.2) in the faces of the driving part. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-3, characterized 
in that to ensure that it is driven in rotation 

with a positive fit with the driving part or with the 
first hub part (1.1), the outer circumference of the 

shaft (2) is provided with a profile which deviates from 
the circular. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-4,  
 

characterized in that the first hub part (1.1) is moulded 
onto a subassembly formed by the shaft (2) and the 

driving part mounted on the latter. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-5, characterized 
in that the second hub part (1.2) is designed as a 

component which is moulded onto the first hub part (1.1) 
after the latter has cured. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-5, characterized 
in that the first hub part (1.1) is bonded to the 

second hub part (1.2). 
Method according to one of Claims 1-7, characterized 
in that the second hub part (1.2) is anchored at 

least axially or tangentially to the first hub part (1.1) 
by fitting positively over or around it. 
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the second hub part (1.2) is rested on the faces of 

the first hub part (1.1) by means of shoulders (1.22; 
1.23) which project radially inwards. 
Method according to one of Claims 1-9, characterized 
in that the gear is fixed on the shaft (2) in the 

form of a transmission shaft of a motorized motor-vehicle 
sliding-roof drive, the shaft being provided on the 

output side with a coupling part (2.2) to allow it to be 
coupled to the sliding-roof drive.
