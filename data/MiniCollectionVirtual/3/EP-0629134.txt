<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the use of catalase-R from Aspergillus niger. Specifically, it has been discovered that catalase-R is superior in performance when compared to commercially available catalase preparations in the neutralization of hydrogen peroxide solutions, particularly contact lens cleaning/disinfecting solutions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the application of an Aspergillus
niger catalase enzyme for the neutralization of hydrogen
peroxide in solution. It was discovered that A. niger produces
two catalases, designated as catalase-A and catalase-R. When
compared to catalase-A and beef liver catalase, catalase-R
shows superior performance for biotechnological applications.
Furthermore, the A. niger catalase-R enzyme is shown to be
approximately four-times as effective as beef liver catalase in
applications requiring the neutralization of concentrated
hydrogen peroxide solutions.Catalases [hydrogen peroxide: hydrogen peroxide
oxidoreductases (EC 1.11.1.6)] are enzymes which catalyze the
conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to oxygen (O2) and water
(H2O) according to the following formula:
2H2O2  Catalase / â€ƒ
 2H2O + O2These ubiquitous enzymes have been purified from a variety of
animal tissues, plants and microorganisms (Chance and Maehly
1955 Methods Enzymol. 2: 764-791; Jones and Wilson 1978 in H.
Sigel (ed.), Metal Ions in Biological Systems, Vol. 7, Marcel
Dekker Inc., New York). Nearly all forms of the enzyme which
have been characterized consist of four polypeptide subunits,
each having a molecular weight of 50,000 to 60,000 and
containing one protohemin prosthetic group per subunit
(Wasserman and Hultin 1981 Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 212: 385-392;
Hartig and Ruis 1986 Eur. J. Biochem. 160: 487-490). Bovine liver catalase has been the most extensively studied
variety of this enzyme [Schonbaum and Chance 1976 in The
Enzymes (P.D. Boyer, ed.) 3rd edn., vol. 13, pp. 363-408,
Academic Press, New York]. The complete amino acid sequence
and three dimensional structure of bovine liver catalase are
known (Schroeder, et al., 1982 Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 214:
397-412; Murthy, et al., 1981 J. Mol. Biol. 152: 465-499).Although less well-studied from a biochemical and biophysical
standpoint, catalases from filamentous fungi have several
characteristics that distinguish them from their mammalian
counterparts. While similar in subunit number and heme
content, fungal catalases are substantially larger molecules
than those from other organisms, having subunit molecular
weights ranging from 80,000 to 97,000 (Vainshtein, et al., 1986
J. Mol. Biol. 188: 63-72; Jacob and Orme-Johnson 1979 Biochem.
18: 2967-2975; Jones, et al., 1987 Biochim. Biophys. Acta 913:
395-398). More importantly, catalases from fungi such as
Aspergillus niger are more stable than beef liver catalase to
proteolysis and to inactivation by glutaraldehyde, SDS,
