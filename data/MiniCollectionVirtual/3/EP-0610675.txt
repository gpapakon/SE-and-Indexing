<ABSTRACT>
After the production of the frame corner and the mechanical fixing of the hollow profiles (1 and 2) pushed onto the legs of a corner connector (3), adhesive-bonding composition is injected through an injection opening (18) into a distribution duct (16) by means of a press, the intention being for said composition to be distributed uniformly on the flank surfaces (14) of the corner connector. For the uniform distribution of the adhesive-bonding composition and for achieving sufficient bonding with the use of a small quantity of composition, the corner connector (3) is provided, in the region of the corner line or of the mitred joint (7), with grooves (13) which extend from the flank surfaces (14) and open into the distribution duct (16). Provided between the flank surfaces (14) and the inner delimitation surfaces of the hollow profiles (1, 2) are spacer pieces (20, 21, 22, 23), these determining the height of the gaps between the abovementioned parts for receiving adhesive-bonding composition. The gaps are filled with adhesive-bonding composition via the grooves (13).

A corner connector and associated mitre-cut hollow profile
members (1, 2) of a frame for windows, doors or facade assemblies

comprising a corner connector (3, 29, 43) engaging with its limbs into
internal chambers of the hollow profile members, their height

corresponding to the internal height of the internal chambers, with
which the hollow profile members (1, 2) can be braced, with force-locking

support in the mitre join, by fixing means which can be shaped
into, driven into or screwed into receiving means in the corner

connector, and further comprising a distribution passage (16) for an
injectable adhesive material, which extends transversely with respect

to the longitudinal central plane (15, 30) and which extends over the
height of the corner connector and which is defined by the hollow

profile members pushed thereon, characterised in that the distribution

passage (16) is defined by a flattened portion (17) in the region of
the outer corner of the corner connector and by the hollow profile

members (1, 2) which are pushed thereon and that in the region of or
adjacent to the corner line (12) or the mitre join (7) the corner

connector (3, 29, 43) has grooves (13, 49) which start from the flank
surfaces (14, 39) extending parallel to its longitudinal central plane

(15, 30) and which communicate with the distribution passage (16) and
that provided between the flank surfaces (14, 39) which extend parallel

to the longitudinal central plane (15, 13) and the inner boundary
surface of the hollow profile members are gap spaces which are

determined by spacer portions (20, 21, 22, 23; 36, 37, 38; 48, 50; 55),
for receiving adhesive material which is supplied through the

distribution passage (16).
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 1 characterised in that the adhesive material

injection opening (18) is provided in the proximity of the mitre join
(7) and opens into the distribution passage (16). 
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 1 characterised in that the spacer portions are in one

piece with the corner connector or with the hollow profile members or are
fitted on to the corner connector or on to the hollow profile members.
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 3 characterised in that the spacer portions (20, 21, 22,

23; 36, 37, 38) are in the form of projections on surface portions of the
flank surfaces or are in the form of ribs.
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 4 characterised in that the spacer portions (20, 21)

which are in one piece with the corner connector and which are in rib form
extend parallel to the corner line, which aligns with the mitre join, of

the corner connector.
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 3 characterised in that the spacer portions (55) which

are in one piece with the hollow profile members are in the form of ribs
extending in the longitudinal direction of the hollow profile members.
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 3 characterised in that the spacer portions are made

from the same material as or a different material from the corner connector
and are fixed to the corner connector by an adhesive agent.
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 1 characterised in that the groove (13) provided in the

corner line between the flank surfaces for distribution of the adhesive
also passes through the inner corner of the corner connector.
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to one of the preceding claims characterised in that the limbs

(8, 9) of the corner connector (3) are of a U-shaped configuration and are
open at the free ends and at the inward sides. 
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to one of the preceding claims characterised in that the fixing

means which are formed out of the hollow profile members form or clear
openings for adhesive to escape outwardly after an adequate degree of

filling is achieved.
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 1 characterised in that the corner connector is divided

therethrough in the longitudinal central plane (30) or in a plane parallel
thereto and the connector portions (31, 32) are positively lockingly

connected together by projections (33) on the one connector portion (31),
which projections extend through the plane of division of the connector

portions and engage into bores (34) in the other connector portion (32).
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 11 characterised in that outside surfaces of the corner

connector which extend to the division plane and which can be coated with
adhesive are sealed off relative to the internal chambers (40) by a

labyrinth seal (41, 42) formed by stepped surfaces.
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
according to claim 1 characterised in that the corner connector (43) has at

least two hollow chambers (45, 46) which are open at the flank sides
extending parallel to the longitudinal central plane and possibly at the

free ends of the connector limbs, the openings are closed at the flank
sides by cover bodies (47), and the cover bodies form grooves and channels

for guiding the adhesive and have the spacer portions (48, 50).
A corner connector and associated hollow profile members
