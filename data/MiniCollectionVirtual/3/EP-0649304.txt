<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides compositions and methods for decreasing tissue breakdown in mammals. Specifically, tissue breakdown in a mammal can be decreased by the administration of composition, wherein said composition comprises from about 35 % to 50 % essential amino acids of which from about 18 % to 30 % are branched chain amino acids, and from about 50 % to 65 % non-essential amino acids, wherein the non-essential amino acids comprise from about 5 % to 15 % ALA and from about 15 % to 45 % GLN. In addition, the present invention provides methods of preparing compositions which are capable of meeting the specific metabolic needs of a patient experiencing catabolic tissue breakdown.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITION AND METHODS FOR DECREASING MUSCLE BREAKDOWNBackground Of The InventionField Of The InventionThe present invention relates to the field of nutritional therapy. Specifically, the present invention provides novel compositions containing the necessary amino acids which, when administered to a mammal, are capable of decreasing the catabolic breakdown of body tissue. Such breakdown can be associated with acute catabolic states or injury, medical therapies such as the use of anti-inflammatory agents, and acute exercise.Description of the Background ArtThe breakdown of body tissue can be associated with a variety of catabolic conditions as well as a side effect of various medical treatments. Catabolic breakdown of body tissue occurs in patients during semistarvation (Pozefsky et al, J. Clin. Invest. 57:444-449 (1976)), prolonged fasting (Felig et al, J. Clin. Invest. 45:584-594 (1969)), acute exercise (Felig et al, J. Clin. Invest. 50:2703-2714 (1971)), injury (Aulick et al, Surgery 55:560-565 (1982)), protein feeding (Abumrad et al, Metabolism 37:463-470 (1982)), infection (Fong et al, J. Clin Invest. 55:1896-1904 (1990)), trauma (Brooks et al, J. Siirg. Res. 40:395-405 (1986)), and steroidal therapy especially glucocorticoids (Kaplan S.A. and Shimizu, C.S.; Endocrinology' 72:267-272 (1963); Ryan W. and Carver, M., Proc. Exp. Biol. Med. 774:816-819 (1963); Muhlbacher F. et al, Am. J. Physiol 247:E75-E83 (1984)).As a result of each of the above, patients experience a marked decrease in tissue mass due to catabolic breakdown. The mechanism 

 -9- leading to the tissue breakdown is unclear; however, it has been postulated that tissue breakdown is but one of the bodily defenses which is mounted against injury, the effect being to increase the inter- and intracellular supply of amino acids. Such amino acids supply the necessary elements for other metabolic activity (such as replication and function of immune and other cells and wound repair) as well as supplying energy.In general, patients suffering from a severe acute catabolic state can require some type of nutritional therapy. The nutritional requirements of these patients are met through the administration of either an enteral or parenteral diet. Enteral diets are usually administered using small-bore tubing which is placed through the nose into the gastric, or duodenal regions, or through surgical implantation as in, for example, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy. Parenteral diets are usually administered intravenously (i.v.). These i.v. fluids are

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of decreasing tissue breakdown in a mammal, comprising administering to said mammal a therapeutical ly effective amount of a composition wherein said composition comprises from about 35% to 50% essential amino acids, from about 50% to 65% non-essential amino acids, and from about 18% to 30% branched chain amino acid; wherein said non- essential amino acids comprise from about 10% to 25 % ALA and from about 15% to 45% GLN.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said mammal is a human.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said composition is administered parenterally.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said composition is administered enterally.
5. The method of any of claims 1-4, wherein said composition additionally contains from about 10-25% glucose.
6. The method of claim 1 , wherein said tissue breakdown results from an acute catabolic state.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein said acute catabolic state is selected from the group consisting of burns, trauma, infection, radiation and chemotherapy. 


 8. The method of claim 1 wherein said tissue breakdown results from the administration of an anti-inflammatory agent.
9. A composition comprising from about 35% to 50% essential amino acids of which from about 18% to 30% are branched chain amino acids, and from about 50% to 65% non-essential amino acids; wherein said non-essential amino acids comprises from about 5 % to 15% ALA and from about 15% to 45 % GLN.
10. The composition of claim 9 further comprising from about 10-15% glucose.
11. A method of preparing a composition which is capable of decreasing catabolic tissue breakdown in a patient comprising the steps of; determining a profile of the types and concentration of essential and non-essential amino acid released in said patient, supplying to said patient a diet containing from about 1 to 2 times the quantity of each of the amino acids present in said profile.
12. The method of claim 11 wherein said diet is an enteral diet.
13. The method of claim 11 wherein said diet is a parenteral diet. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
