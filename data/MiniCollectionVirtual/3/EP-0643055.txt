<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 
ketals of 2-amino-1,3-propanediol and more particularly relates to a 
process for the preparation of 5-amino-2,2-dialkyl-1,3-dioxanes. The ketals of 2-amino-1,3-propanediol are advantageously used as 
synthetic intermediates in the preparation of the compound (S)-N,N'-bis-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-5-[(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropyl)amino]-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzenedicarboxamide, 
known with the International 
Nonproprietary Name of Iopamidol (Merck Index, XI ed., page 
799, No. 4943). Iopamidol was first described by the Swiss Company Savac A.G. in the 
British patent No. 1,472,050 and is used in diagnostics as a non 
ionic X-rays contrast medium. The preparation of Iopamidol, described in said patent, comprises 
the condensation reaction of L-5-(2-acetoxy-propionylamino)-2,4,6-triiodo-isophthalic 
acid dichloride with 2-amino-1,3-propanediol, 
better known as serinol, in dimethylacetamide and in the presence of 
a base. Alternatively, in the same patent, it is described a method comprising 
the condensation reaction of the above acid dichloride, with 
a ketal of serinol; the subsequent acid hydrolysis of the formed 
diketal, carried out by conventional techniques, allows thus to 
obtain the desired product. Among the possible ketals of serinol which can be used in said 
synthesis, for instance, 5-amino-2,2-dialkyl-1,3-dioxanes are cited. 
Several processes for the preparation of 5-amino-2,2-dialkyl-1,3-dioxanes 
are reported in the literature. The British patent application No. 2,081,256 (Rhône-Poulenc  
 
Industries) and the United States patent No. 3,812,186 (Eprova A.G.) 
describe the preparation of 5-amino-2,2-dialkyl-1,3-dioxanes by 
catalytic hydrogenation of the corresponding 5-nitro derivatives, 
prepared, in turn, by direct cyclization of 2-nitro-1,3-propanediol 
with a suitable ketone, in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate. In the United States patent No. 4,978,793 (W.R. Grace & Co.) is described 
the preparation of 5-amino-2,2-dialkyl-1,3-dioxanes which 
comprises at first the synthesis of the corresponding 5-nitro-derivatives, 
through a three step process starting from nitromethane and 
formaldehyde and subsequently the reduction of the nitro group. The processes for the preparation of 5-amino-2,2-dialkyl-1,3-dioxanes 
described in the literature evidence the remarkable drawback of 
using nitro derivatives as intermediates, which are particularly 
unstable and explosive compounds. Now we have found and it is the
