<ABSTRACT>
The present invention pertains to a multicomponent prosthesis 
for use in traumatology, orthopedics and veterinary medicine for 

joint prosthesis operations, which consists of at least a first 
component (11, 111) and a second component (112) [sic, (12, 112) 

- Tr.Ed.] which are connected by a first conical coupling (15, 

115; 21, 121) and a second conical coupling (23, 26; 123, 126), 
which is coaxial and is tapered in the opposite direction to that 

of the first, conical coupling The second conical coupling is 
formed by a conical seat (23, 123) made in the second component 

(12, 112) of the prosthesis, by a female friction cone (13, 113) 
inserted into the conical seat (11, 111) [sic, (23, 123) - Tr.Ed.]
 
and by a locking counterscrew (14) which is screwed onto the first 

component and interacts axially with the female friction cone (13) 
in order to immobilize it in the conical seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains, in particular, to hip 
prostheses, but it can also be applied in other joint prosthesis 
operations, such as those for the shoulder, the knee, etc. More 
specifically, the present invention pertains to the joining among 
the components of the shaft of a prosthesis to be mounted in the 
medullary pin, if necessary. which is suitably adapted and bears 
the joint head, and when the said shaft necessarily consists of 
two or more complementary parts. The joint prosthesis operation as concerns the hip is usually 
carried out by resectioning the femoral head, adapting the proximal 
medullary pin of the femur, and then by fixing a prosthesis using, 
if considered valid, a special cement; the completed unit with the 
mounting of a spherical head is intended to replace the natural 
femoral head. Various types of prostheses, having various geometric shapes 
and being made with various types of alloys and/or metals, are 
available in the fields of orthopedics, traumatology and 
veterinary medicine. It is almost always felt to be necessary to 
have available a prosthesis that is suitable for each femur, and 
when this is indispensable, one resorts to making personalized 
prostheses by designing them with the aid of computerized axial 
tomography (CAT), but with a resulting, very often unacceptable, 
bearing on the costs. Therefore, in order to avoid modifications 
to the normal single-piece prostheses, which can really only 
succeed thanks to the high professional skill of the surgeon 
one would have to resort to a two-component or three-component 
prosthesis. In other words and for example, if the distal part is 
separated from the proximal part of a prosthesis shaft and/or the 
upper headholder part of the said proximal part, the different 
components can be selected as a function of the geometry of the 
skeleton on which the operation is being performed, reducing the 
bone removal as much as possible by means of adjustment and 
avoiding irreparable damage. Therefore, it could be possible to achieve the distribution of 
loads on the femur and thus the different stresses due to the 
forces that act on the prosthesis in various directions, under as 
natural conditions as possible, and with easily imaginable 
advantages for the individual, certainly limiting costs and 
tremendously facilitating the operation, and shortening the 
postoperative course and the rehabilitation times. For this 
reason, proposals have already been made for multicomponent  
 
prostheses, which, however, have

Multicomponent prosthesis for use in traumatology, 
orthopedics and veterinary medicine for joint prosthesis 

operations, consisting of at least a first component (11, 111) and 
a second component (112), which are connected at the adjoining 

ends by a first conical coupling (15, 115; 21, 121) which is 
tapered in one direction and is formed by a conical end (15, 115) 

at one end of the said first component (11, 111) which is inserted 
into a conical housing (21, 121) at the adjoining end of the 

said second component, characterized by a second conical 
coupling (23, 26; 123, 126), which is coaxial and is tapered in 

the opposite direction to that of the said first conical coupling, 
and which is formed by a conical seat (23, 123) made on the said 

second component (12, 112) of the prosthesis, by a female friction 
cone (13, 113), which is applied and is axially adjustable in the 

said second component, and by a locking counterscrew (14) which is 
screwed onto the said first component and interacts with the said 

female friction cone (13) in order to immobilize it in the conical 
seat of the said second component. 
Multicomponent prosthesis in accordance with claim 1, in
