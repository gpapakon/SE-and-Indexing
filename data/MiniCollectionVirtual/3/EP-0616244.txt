<ABSTRACT>
A film cassette contains a 35mm wide photographic film (1) 
without any of the perforations typically used to transport this kind 

of film, having one side of its rectangular effective photographic area 
(3) in a widthwise direction of the film (1) substantially equal to 

30mm and lateral control portions (2A, 2B).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to film cassettes. A photographic film now widely used is 35mm wide, and the photo-sensitive 
materials for forming such a photographic film are 
standardized by the International Organization of Standards (ISO). In 
such a film, the width between the outer edges of the film is 35mm, and 
a plurality of rectangular perforations are aligned along each edge of 
the film. The perforations are used to transport the film as it is 
exposed, and they may also be used during the development and printing 
processes. The dimension of each perforation in the widthwise 
direction of the film is 2.79mm and the dimension in the lengthwise 
direction of the film is 1.98mm. The distance between each perforation 
and the edge of the film is 2.01mm, and the distance between the 
opposing perforations in respective sides of the film is 25mm. The 
pitch of the perforations is 4.75mm. In such film, each frame, which is the effective photographic 
area, is rectangular in shape and is 24mm in the widthwise direction of 
the film. The pitch of the frames is 38mm, which is eight times the 
pitch of the perforations which is taken as a reference. In order to improve the image quality obtained from such film the 
following proposals have been made: (1) the photo-sensitive material 
should be improved to improve resolution; and (2) the width of the film 
should be increased to increase the frame size, so that resulting 
prints would require less enlargement and would appear sharper. In general, the particle size of the photo-sensitive material 
coated on the film determines the resolution and the sensitivity of the 
film, and these two parameters are inversely related. Hence, without 
the discovery of a new photo-sensitive material, it is difficult to 
improve the image quality according to proposal (1). Proposal (2) involves an increase in the width of the 
photographic film. Thus, the camera must necessarily also be increased 
in size and weight, which goes contrary to the recent trend that seeks 
to reduce the size and weight of cameras. Furthermore, all existing 
equipment for manufacturing and for developing film would have to be 
modified to correspond to the increased width. Two other proposals that have been made involve changes to the  
 
camera: (3) the size or portion of the image that is picked-up can be 
changed by changing the magnification of the lens attached to the 
camera body; and (4) the effective photographic area on the film cam be 
increased by recording magnification control data for

<CLAIMS>
A film cassette comprising: 
   a photographic film (1) which is 35mm wide, is devoid of sprocket 

perforations, has a quadrilateral effective photographic area (3) the 
dimension (W1) of one side of which in the film-width direction is 

substantially 30mm and at least one control portion (2A, 2B) provided 
on the film (1), the control portion having a dimension of 

substantially 2.5mm in the film-width direction and being located 
between a longitudinal edge of the film (1) and an edge of the 

effective photographic area; and 
   a single casing means accommodating the 35mm wide photographic 

film (1) therein with a leader portion of the film (1) protruding 
therefrom and having a spool on which is wound the accommodated portion 

of the film (1). 
A film cassette according to claim 1, wherein the or each control 
portion (2A, 2B) comprises small round apertures (4) each with a 

diameter of about 1mm and aligned at predetermined pitch. 
A film cassette according to claim 2, wherein the predetermined 
pitch is substantially 5.25mm or 6.28mm. 
A film cassette according to claim 1, wherein the or each control 
portion comprises aligned predetermined magnetic pitch marks.
