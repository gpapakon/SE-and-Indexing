<ABSTRACT>
A composite catalyst which contains:   - a zeolite of MFI structure containing silicon, aluminium and/or gallium in its lattice and in which the outer surface of its crystallites has been modified after its synthesis,   - a matrix, - at least one doping element chosen from the group consisting of gallium and zinc when the zeolite does not contain any gallium in its crystalline lattice, - optionally at least one doping element chosen from the group consisting of gallium and zinc when the zeolite contains gallium in its crystalline lattice, - optionally at least one element chosen from the group consisting of the alkali and alkaline-earth metals.   The invention also relates to the use of this catalyst in aromatization reactions of hydrocarbons contains from 2 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule.

Composite catalyst containing:

a MFI structure zeolite which has been modified
following synthesis by at least one treatment

with at least one dilute fluorosilicate cation
solution, the total dealumination ratio of the treated

zeolite being less than 5 atomic %, said zeolite
containing silicon and at least one element selected

from the group formed by aluminium and gallium in its
framework,
a matrix,
at least one doping element selected from the
group formed by gallium and zinc deposited on

at least one support selected from the group
formed by the matrix and the zeolite.
Catalyst according to claim 1 containing 1 to 99 %
by weight with respect to the total catalyst mass of

said zeolite.
Catalyst according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
doping element content is between 0.01 and 10 % by

weight. 
Composite catalyst according to any one of claims 1
to 3 containing 0.001 to 6 % by weight of at least one

element selected from the group formed by the alkali and
alkaline-earth metals.
Composite catalyst according to any one of claims 1
to 4 wherein said doping element is gallium.
Composite catalyst according to any one of claims 1
to 5 wherein said dilute solution contains between

0.0006 and 0.006 moles of cation fluorosilicate per
100 g of dry zeolite.
