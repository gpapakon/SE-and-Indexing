<ABSTRACT>
A dye mixture is disclosed. The mixture is 
useful in recording layers of optical recording 

elements. The mixture has: 

a) a real index of refraction of at least 1.8 
in the 780 to 790 nm region of the spectra; 
b) an imaginary index (k) between 0.3 and 
0.02 in the 780 to 790 nm region of the spectra; 
c) a metallized azo dye comprising an azo 
group linking a substituted 3-hydroxy-pyridine nucleus 

to a phenyl nucleus wherein the phenyl nucleus has an 
alkoxy or thioether substituent at its 2-position; and 
d) at least a second dye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates dye mixtures.
The mixtures are particularly useful in optical
recording layers and elements.Optical recording materials for storing
information are known. One of the currently popular
forms of optical storage of information is the compact
disk or CD. Digital information is stored in the form
of marks or with low specular reflectivity pits on an
otherwise reflective background. In this format, the
optical information is most often in the form of read
only memory or ROM. Optical information is not usually
recorded in real time but rather is produced by press
molding. In a typical process, the optical recording
substrate is first press molded with a master
containing the digital information to be reproduced.
The thus formed information is then overcoated with a
reflective layer and then with an optional protective
layer. In those areas having the deformations or pits,
the specular reflectivity is lower than in those areas
not having the deformations.It is desirable to produce optical recording
media which, when recorded in real time, produces a
record that mimics CD-ROM on read out. Read out is at
780 nm. In this manner, information can be added to
the CD and the CD can be used on a conventional CD
player.One recently disclosed system of this type is
the so called "Photo CD". In this system, conventional
photographic film is first processed in a conventional
manner. Then, the images from the film are digitized
and the digital information is recorded in a CD
readable form on an optical recording material. Images
can then be played back by means of a CD type player on 
a conventional television. Since the Photo CD is not
recorded to its capacity in a single session, or played
back only once, long time multi session recording and
play back capacity is needed. Thus, the need for very
stable recording materials.One method for forming a recordable element
that mimics conventional injection pressed CD elements
is to provide a support having thereon, in order, a
layer of a dye that absorbs recording radiation and
generates the needed change in the specular
reflectivity and a reflective layer. Exposure of the
recording layer through the support by the recording
beam heats the recording layer to an extent that it is
said that the surface of the heat deformable support
just adjacent to the recording layer surface is
deformed and the dye or dyes are changed to reduce
specular reflectivity. Materials of this type are
described in US-A-4,940,618, European Patent
