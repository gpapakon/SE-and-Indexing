<ABSTRACT>
A flexible fire and heat resistant material comprising an intimate mixture of organic intumescent filler and organic fibres adapted to char intensely within the temperature range of 200  DEG C to 500  DEG C. The added presence of inorganic fibre components enhances the structural integrity of this structure both during char formation up to 500  DEG C and at higher temperatures up to 1200  DEG C once char oxidation takes place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fire and heat resistant 
materials and their use as barriers to the propagation of fire 
heat, and flame. A wide variety of materials are employed as barriers to the 
propagation of fire. They resist the advance of a fire to a 
corresponding wide degree. Clearly materials which readily 
ignite and are readily combusted provide little or no barrier 
whilst at the other extreme materials such as asbestos will 
resist extremes of heat and fire. Where a rigid barrier such as an asbestos sheet cannot be 
utilised, protective and barrier fabric structures are adopted in 
a variety of types of textile products having different levels of 
performance. Within the United Kingdom, for example, such 
products find themselves within the end-use areas of both 
protective clothing (workwear, civil emergency services, defence 
organisations) and barrier textiles (transport upholstery 
fabrics, transport upholstery barriers, contract/domestic 
barriers). In terms of performance, known textiles designed for 
heat and flame protection can be divided into three broad 
categories: (i) flame retardant conventional textiles which 
transform to char barriers when heated above 250°C; (ii) higher 
performance textiles which char above 400°C; and (iii) ceramic 
fibre-containing fabrics which resist prolonged exposures up to 
about 1000°C. Fabrics possessing organic fibre contents which have 
desirable textile properties at ambient conditions, carbonise 
when heated in air or inert atmosphere above 250°C and slowly 
oxidise in air above 400-500°C are well known. These are 
typified by a whole range of product, ranging from flame 
retardant cotton and wool fabrics to inherently flame and heat 
resistant polyaromatic structures. Of these, the higher 
performance examples such as aramid and/or carbonised  
 
fibre-containing barrier fabrics will survive only a few minutes 
when heated up to temperatures as high as 1000°C. The organic materials which are used to form these known 
initially flexible barriers tend to char upon exposure to high 
temperature to produce a black residue. Although these charred 
residues are potentially valuable as barriers to the propagation 
of the fire, in practice, as indicated above, they are not 
terribly effective because the charred residues are brittle and 
become increasingly fragile when they oxidise at temperatures 
above 400°C. Both these results mean that the residues will tend 
to lose their mechanical integrity in the harsh environments 
associated with many

A material as claimed in Claim 9 characterised in that the 
increase in thickness is at least 50%. 
A material according to any preceding claim when including 
the limitations of any of Claims 4 to 7 characterised in that the

initial thickness of the material for periods of 10 minutes or 

more when heated up to 900°C.

A material as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in 
that said organic fibres which are adapted to char intensely
