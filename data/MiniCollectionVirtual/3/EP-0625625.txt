<ABSTRACT>
A power operating system for a vehicle door 
includes a motor operable to power the door open or 

closed. When a manual movement of the door a 
predetermined distance is detected while the motor is 

inactive, the motor is energised so as to move the 
door in the direction of the detected movement to 

complete the manually initiated door movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of an 
electrically driven door on a motor vehicle and 
specifically to manual to power control of the 
electrically driven door. 
US-A-4 952 080 discloses an arrangement 
in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1. Electrically driven doors on a vehicle are 
generally known. For example, it is known to provide 
an electrically powered sliding door for a van in 
which the door is opened and closed by operation of an 
electric motor. Typically, operation of a switch by 
the vehicle operator or a passenger within the vehicle 
is required to initiate the power opening or closing 
of the sliding door. To initiate operation of the 
door by a person on the outside of the vehicle would 
require the person to first enter the vehicle or to 
reach into an open door in order to gain access to the 
switch. Alternatively, an external switch would be 
required on the outside of the vehicle and generally 
on the body of the vehicle versus the door, since the 
sliding door does not typically have any power 
supplied thereto until electrical contact is made when 
the door is closed. The avoidance of this external 
switch would be desirable. It would be desirable to provide a means by 
which a person external to the vehicle may initiate 
powered movement of the door without requiring the 
addition of an external switch on the vehicle body or 
without requiring either entry into the vehicle or 
reaching into the vehicle. It is the general object of this invention 
to provide an improved powered door closure system for 
a vehicle that enables a person external to the 
vehicle to initiate powered opening or closing of the 
door and that does not require entry into the vehicle 
or the reaching into the vehicle to gain access to a  
 
switch or other means for initiating powered door 
operation. A vehicle door controller in accordance with 
the present invention is characterised over US-A-4 952 080 by the features 
specified in Claim 1. In a general form of the present invention, 
a power operating system for a vehicle door includes a 
motor operable to power the door open or closed. When 
a manual movement of the door is detected while the 
motor is inactive, the motor is energised so as to 
move the door in the direction of the detected 
movement to complete the manually initiated door 
movement. In one aspect of the present invention, the 
motor is energised to power move the door when door is 
manually moved a predetermined distance. In yet 
another aspect of the present invention,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle door controller for a vehicle 
door (12) moveable between a closed position and an 

opened position, the vehicle door controller having 
electric drive means including a door operator 

selectively operable to move the vehicle door in an 
opening direction to the opened position and in a closing 

direction to the closed position, means (122,124) for 
sensing a door movement and generating distance pulses, 

each distance pulse representing a predetermined 
incremental distance of travel of the vehicle door, and 

means responsive to the sensed door movement for 
operating the door operator in the one of the opening and 

closing directions of the sensed door movement,
 
characterised in that the means for sensing a door 

movement includes means (374-378) for sensing one of the 
opening and closing directions of movement of the vehicle 

door and wherein the responsive means comprises means for 
selectively energising the door operator to power move 

the vehicle door in the one of the opening and closing 
directions sensed by the door movement sensor when a 

predetermined number of the distances pulses representing 
a predetermined distance of movement of the vehicle door 

are generated while the door operator is de-energised. 
A vehicle door controller as claimed in 
Claim 1, wherein the door operator includes (A) cable 

means (72,88) attached to the vehicle door (12), (B) a 
pulley means (84,96) rotatable in a first direction to 

wind the cable means to move the vehicle door in a 
closing direction toward the closed position and in a 

second direction to wind the cable means to move the 
vehicle door in an opening direction toward the opened 

position, (C) an electric motor (108) having an output 
shaft (110), and (D) an electromagnetic clutch (114) 

coupled to the output shaft and the pulley means, the  
 

electromagnetic clutch, when energised, coupling the 
output shaft and the pulley means to enable the output 

shaft to rotate the pulley means and thereby move the 
vehicle door and, when de-energised, decouple the output 

shaft from the pulley means to enable the vehicle door to 
be manually moveable between the opened and closed 

positions, the pulley means being rotated in the first 
direction by the cable means when the vehicle door in 

manually moved in the closing direction and in the second 
direction by the cable means when the vehicle door is 

manually moved in the opening direction; wherein the 
sensing means includes a rotary position sensor (122) 

rotated by the pulley means for (A) indicating one of the 
first and second directions of rotation of the pulley 

means and therefore the opening and closing directions of 
movement of the vehicle door and (B) generating the 

distance pulses; and wherein the responsive means 
includes means for (A) determining the generation of a 

predetermined number of distance pulses by the rotary 
position sensor in response to a manual movement of the 

vehicle door and (B) when the predetermined number of 
distance pulses is determined, energising the 

electromagnetic clutch to couple the output shaft to the 
pulley means and energising the electric motor to rotate 

the pulley means in the direction indicated by the rotary 
position sensor in response to manual movement of the 

vehicle door to power move the vehicle door toward the 
one of the opening and closing directions of the manual 

movement.
