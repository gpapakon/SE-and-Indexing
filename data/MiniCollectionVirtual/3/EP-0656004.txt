<ABSTRACT>
Platelet activating factor receptor antagonists of diverse structures are imparted with 5-lipoxygenase activity by adding a moiety such as a hydroxamate, hydroxyurea, oxalkane, thioalkane, quinolylmethoxy, or amidohydroxyurea to the PAF receptor antagonist at a position on the PAF antagonist molecule that demonstrates "bulk tolerance", i.e., the ability to accommodate functionality without the significant loss of PAF activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DUAL FUNCTIONAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTSThis invention is in the area of pharmaceutical compositions and methods for the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders, and specifically provides novel compounds that have PAF receptor antagonist activity and inhibit the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase.Platelet activating factor (PAF, 1-0-alkyl- 2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine) is a potent inflammatory phospholipid mediator with a wide variety of biological activities. PAF was initially identified as a water soluble compound released by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized rabbit basophils. It is now known that PAF is also generated and released by onocytes, macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (P Ns) , eosinophils, neutrophils, natural killer lymphocytes, platelets and endothelial cells, as well as by renal and cardiac tissues under appropriate immunological and non-immunological stimulation. (Hwang, "Specific receptors of platelet-activating factor, receptor heterogeneity, and signal transduction mechanisms", Journal of Lipid Mediators 2, 123 (1990).) PAF causes the aggregation and degranulation of platelets at very low concentrations. The potency (active at 10"12 to 10""M) , tissue level (picomoles) and short plasma half life (2-4 minutes) of PAF are similar to those of other lipid mediators such as thromboxane A2, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes. PAF mediates biological responses by binding to specific PAF receptors found in a wide variety of cells and tissues. Structure-activity studies on PAF and its analogs indicate that the ability of PAF to bind to these receptors is highly structure specific and stereospecific. (Shen, et al., "The Chemical and Biological Properties of PAF Agonists, Antagonists, and Biosynthetic 

Inhibitors", Platelet-Activating Factor- and Related Lipid Mediators, F. Snyder, Ed. Plenum Press, New York, NY 153 (1987)). While PAF mediates essential biological responses, it also appears to play a role in pathological immune and inflammatory responses. Many published studies have provided evidence for the involvement of PAF in human diseases, including arthritis, acute inflammation, asthma, endotoxic shock, pain, psoriasis, ophthalmic inflammation, ischemia, gastrointestinal ulceration, myocardial infarction, inflammatory bowel diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Animal models also demonstrate that PAF is produced or increased in certain pathological states.The involvement of PAF in pathological inflammatory and immune states has stimulated a
