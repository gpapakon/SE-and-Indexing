<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for closing off the lateral ends of a roller shutter box. The device according to the invention comprises an end plate (18) made so that it engages with a foot piece (19) in order to completely shut off a recess in a lateral wall of the roller shutter box. The end plate (18) is fitted with a plurality of projecting teeth (22a, b, c) made so that they anchor into a box base. The foot piece (19) is also fitted with small spikes (33) designed to anchor into longitudinal walls of the box. Advantageously, these teeth (22a, b, c) and these spikes (33) have inclined faces  alpha  made so that they cause the longitudinal walls of the box to tighten around the end plate and the foot piece. A closure device of this type has the advantage that it is very quick to install.

<CLAIMS>
Device for closing the lateral ends of 
a roller-shutter box, said box (10) being so designed as to 

accommodate a roller shutter (V) and a corresponding driving 
mechanism (M), said closing device having a generally 

parallelepipedic shape and comprising: 

a base (13), 
two longitudinal walls (11), each of said 
walls being equipped with a guide rail (16) at its free end, 
and two lateral ends having a recess (20), 
said device being characterised in that it comprises: 
a side wall (18), the shape of which 
matches the cross-section of the recess in the lateral end 

(20) of the box (10), said side wall being so designed as to 
contact the box (10) along a peripheral support zone (21) 

equipped with a stop collar (23), said support zone being 
provided with projecting anchoring means (22a, b, c) so 

designed as to anchor themselves in the box (10), 
and a heel section (19) so designed as to 
be inserted in sliding manner into the guide rails (16), to 

cooperate with the side wall (18) and the longitudinal walls 
(11) of the box, and to form an impervious lateral end, said 

heel section (19) comprising blocking means (30, 31) so 
designed as to block translational motion of the side wall 

(18) in relation to the heel section (19) as well as 
anchoring means (33) so designed as to penetrate the 

longitudinal walls (11) of the box (10). 
Device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the blocking means (30, 31) of the 

heel section (19) are constituted by stops, i.e. a first 
stop (30) and a second stop (31), so designed as to 

accommodate jointly a lower part of the side wall (18). 
Device according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that the first stop (30) is so designed as 

to be accommodated within a recess (25) provided within the 
lower internal part of the side wall (18).  

 
Device according to Claim 2 or Claim 3,
 
characterised in that the second stop (31) is constituted by 

a plurality of wedges (31) forming a ramp (32) so designed 
as to enable sliding displacement of the side wall (18) in 

relation to the heel section (19) and blocking of said units 
(18, 19) in position. 
Device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the anchoring means (33) of the heel 

section are constituted by two spikes so designed as to 
penetrate the longitudinal walls (11) of the box. 
Device according to Claim 5,
 
characterised in that the spikes (33) have an inclined face 

(Î±) so designed as to draw together the longitudinal walls 
(11) as they penetrate said longitudinal walls. 
Device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the anchoring means (22a, b, c) of the 

side wall are constituted by at least two teeth (22a, c) 
arranged on the support zone (21). 
Device according to Claim 7,
 
characterised in that the teeth (22a, c) have an inclined 

face so designed as to facilitate positioning of the side 
wall (18) perpendicularly to the base (13) of the box. 
Device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the heel section 

(19) comprises a plurality of seats (34) so designed as to 
accommodate a retaining element (36) firmly connected to an 

underside (42) having the function of closing off a lower 
part of the box. 
Device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the side wall (18) 

has a face, the so-called external face, said face being 
provided with a plurality of predetermined securing points 

(24) which are so designed as to accommodate securing means 
for the roller shutter (V) and the driving means (M) 

arranged in the box. 
Device according to Claim 10,
 
characterised in that the securing points (24) are devoid of  

 
an outlet and so designed as to be completely perforated 

when securing said roller shutter. 
Device according to Claim 10 or Claim 
11, characterised in that the external face of the side wall 

is provided with reinforcements (43) so designed as to 
enhance the rigidity of each securing point (24).
