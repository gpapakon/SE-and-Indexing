<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent for 
enhancing the drug effects of an antitumor drug, which 
comprises a pyridine derivative or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient. Remarkable developments have been observed in the 
chemotherapy of cancer. There have been an increasing 
number of cases in which some of cancers have been 
reportedly completely healed. However, there are still a 
number of problems yet to be solved. Among them, to 
reduce the side effects, to overcome drug resistance 
against antitumor drugs and to prevent relapse and 
metastatis are problems which are desired to be solved as 
soon as possible. Further, no antitumor drugs have been 
developed which are truly effective against solid cancers 
such as carcinoma of the colon, cancer of the stomach and 
carcinoma of the esophagus. In the clinical field, it is frequently experienced 
that antitumor drugs which were initially effective, tend 
to be non-effective during an extended period of  
 
treatment. Further, when a tumor metastasizes or recurs, 
an antitumor agent is no longer effective in many cases. Among various factors attributable to such tendency, 
it is known to be an important factor. that cancer cells 
acquire drug resistance against antitumor drugs. Yet, it frequently happens that cancer cells which 
acquired drug resistance against a certain particular 
antitumor drug, also show resistance against many other 
antitumor drugs which are totally different from the 
particular antitumor drug in their chemical structures or 
functional mechanisms (multidrug resistance), which 
constitutes a serious obstacle in the chemotherapy of 
cancer. The study on the multidrug resistance against 
antitumor drugs has been rapidly progressed in recent 
years, and a part of the mechanism has been made clear. 
Namely, in the cancer cells which acquire resistance, an 
increase of a certain P-glycoprotein is observed which 
has a function of a drug efflux pump, whereby the 
antitumor drug is pumped out of the cells in an energy 
dependent fashion, and consequently, the concentration of 
the antitumor agent in the cells decreases. Tsuruo et al have found that Verapamil i.e. one of 
calcium antagonistic drugs overcomes the multidrug 
resistance against antitumor drugs (see Cancer Res. 41; 
1967-1972 (1981)). Akasawa et al have reported that calcium antagonistic  
 
drug nicardipin enhances the antitumor activities of 
vindecine sulfate (Cancer and Chemotherapy, vol. 11, 943-947 
(1984)). It has also been
