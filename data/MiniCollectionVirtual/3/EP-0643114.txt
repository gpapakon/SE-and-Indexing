<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition used 
as an ingredient of printing inks, which comprises an organic 
pigment and a pigment derivative. Pigments contained in non-aqueous dispersions, such 
as printing inks, are often flocculated and cause various 
problems, such as precipitation of the ingredient, viscosity 
increase of dispersion, reduction of tinting strength, 
lowering of gloss, color separation when pigments of different 
types are mixed, and the like. There have been a number of 
proposals, particularly on phthalocyanine pigments or 
quinacridone pigments, in order to overcome problems 
accompanied by the flocculation of the pigments or lowering of 
fluidity. For example, methods of admixing the pigment with 
a pigment derivative which is obtained by introducing a sulfo 
group into a pigment or a metal salt thereof as described in 
JP-B-50-4019 ("JP-B-" means Japanese examined patent 
publication), admixing the pigment with a substituted 
aminomethyl derivative as described in JP-B-39-16787, and 
admixing the pigment with a phthalimidemethyl derivative as 
described in JP-A-55-108466 ("JP-A-" means Japanese unexamined 
patent publication) have been proposed. Further, as an 
improvement, methods of admixing the pigment with a 
sulfonamde derivative of diamine as described in JP-B-1-34268, 
admixing the pigment with a methylimidazole derivative 
as described in JP-A-1-213366, and the like have been known. According to the above-mentioned methods, reduction  
 
of viscosity of the dispersion can be attained to a certain 
extent, but the effect is greatly affected according to the 
type of vehicles employed and the additional problems of 
reduction of tinting strength, lowering of gloss and the like 
have not yet been solved, so the effect thus far has not yet 
been satisfactory. Particularly for gravure printing inks, 
compounds which are effective to solve the above mentioned 
problems have not been known. The present inventors have conducted extensive 
studies for solving the problems mentioned above and, as a 
result, found a pigment derivative which can solve the 
problems and completed the present invention. The present invention provides a composition for an 
ingredient of printing ink, which comprises an organic pigment 
and a pigment derivative represented by the formula( I ) in 
the acid form: 
wherein D represents a residue of an organic pigment other 
than azo, R₁ represents a hydrogen atom or an unsaturated 
aliphatic, saturated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group 
having
