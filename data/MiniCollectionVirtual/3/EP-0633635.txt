<ABSTRACT>
The device uses an electrical conductor band (5), wound in concentric coils within a housing having a central core (2) fitted around the steering column and a bottom housing part (3) fixed to a stationary part of the vehicle. The terminals at the opposite ends of the conductor based are attached to the core and the bottom housing part respectively. A releasable locking mechanism (7) acts between the core and the bottom housing part in a radial direction w.r.t. the steering column and is released upon fitting the steering wheel (13) via a ramp surface (14) of the latter.

<CLAIMS>
A coil spring (1) in an electrical supply line (6) to a steering wheel (13) of a motor 
vehicle, comprising an electrical conductor band (5) which is arranged in concentric coils 

in a casing (2, 3) and one end of which terminates in a core (2) secured to the steering 
wheel around a steering spindle and the other end of which terminates on a lower casing 

part (3) held on the vehicle body, with a locking device (7) - mounted on the casing and 

acting in a radial direction to the axis of rotation of the coil spring - between the core and 
the lower casing part, 
characterized in that
 the locking device (7) is arranged flat on a 
flange of the core (2) outside the core (2) and engages in the lower casing part (3) from 

outside in the radial direction to the axis of rotation. 
A coil spring according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the locking device (7) is 
movable and thus lockable in the radial direction by positioning the steering wheel (13) 

by a ramp (14) arranged on the steering wheel. 
A coil spring according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the locking device (7) comprises 
a sheet-metal strip (8) with two projections (11, 15) arranged at the ends thereof 

and is held spring-loaded in a rest position in which the first projection (11) engages in 
one of a plurality of recesses (12) provided on the outside of the lower casing part (3), 

and the locking device can be moved into an operating position by the second projection 
(15) mounted on the inside of the core being movable radially outwards by a ramp (14) 

arranged on the steering wheel.
