<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coupling for liquified products at low temperatures for connecting two conduit ends (12, 13) via a receiving and a penetrating coupling piece (10, 11), each of which has a shut-off valve (20, 21) which is arranged on the outer conduit ends (12, 13) and by means of which through-flow openings can be closed. In order to reduce the decanting time for liquified products at low temperatures, means seal off both through-flow openings (25, 36) from ambient air before they are opened when the shut-off valves (20, 21) are in contact.

Coupling for low-temperature liquidified media,
which has two conduit ends and a receiving coupling

piece and a penetrating coupling piece for connecting
the two conduit ends, the coupling pieces having a

shut-off arranged at each of the outer conduit ends,
throughflow orifices being capable of being closed by

means of said shut-off valves, and, when the shut-off
valves (20, 21) are in contact, means sealing off both

throughflow orifices (25, 36) against ambient air prior
to their opening, and each of the coupling pieces (10,

11) having a tubular vacuum-insulated coupling housing
(40, 18), and the coupling housings (14, 18)

overlapping one another when the coupling pieces (10,
11) are in the pushed-together state, characterized in

that the means consist of valve housings (24, 43) which
surround the valve heads (22, 35) of the shut-off

valves (20, 21) and which come to bear sealingly
preferably after the contact of the valve heads (22,

35) and, when the two coupling pieces (20, 11) come
nearer to one another, open the throughflow orifices

(25, 36), and in that the valve heads (22, 35) are
provided with radial gaskets (33, 44) which prevent the

media from flowing through out of the vale housings
(24, 43) and which bear on suitable sealing surfaces of

the valve housings (24, 43).
Coupling according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the valve housings (24, 43) come to bear in an

overlapping manner and at least one valve housing (24)
is provided with a gasket (50) in th
e bearing region of
the two valve housings (24, 43).
Coupling according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the valve heads (22, 35) close

off on the end face the conduit ends (12, 13) located
opposite one another and the throughflow orifices (25,

36) emanate radially from the valve heads (22, 35).
Coupling to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the valve head (35) and the valve housing (43) 

of the penetrating coupling piece (10), when
approaching the valve head (22) and the valve housing

(24) of the receiving coupling piece (11), displace the
ambient air virtually completely, and the throughflow

orifices (25, 36) are sealed off, virtually without any
ambient air being included.
Coupling to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the valve head (35) of the penetrating coupling

piece (10) is of bowl-shaped design and has a shoulder
(39), on which is supported a spring (37) which brings

the valve head (35) to bear on a shoulder (42) of the
valve housing (43).
Coupling according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the valve head (22) of the

receiving coupling piece (11) is of bowl-shaped design
and has at its head end a bearing surface (23), on

which a spring (27) surrounding the valve head (22)
brings the valve housing (24) to bear.
Coupling according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the valve heads (22, 35) are

connected via their open sides to the conduit ends (12,
13).
Coupling according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the springs (27, 37) are arranged

in the medium.
Coupling according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the axial displacement of the

penetrating coupling piece (10) takes place via a
connecting element (15) which bears on a shoulder (17)

and which is in engagement with a counterpiece (16)
provided on the receiving coupling piece (11).
Coupling according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the connecting element (15) is a

union nut which is connected via balls (19) to the
coupling housing (14) of the penetrating coupling piece

(10).
Coupling according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the coupling housing (18) of the

receiving coupling piece (11) is provided, on its side 
directed towards the connecting element (15), with a

protective edge (52).
Coupling according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that the valve heads (22, 35) are

produced from plastic.
