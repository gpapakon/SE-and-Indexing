<ABSTRACT>
A method which assists in the early diagnosis of rejection in a liver transplant recipient comprises measuring an increase in plasma or serum alpha glutathione S-transferase ( alpha -GST) from said recipient in the absence of or preceding any change in plasma or serum transaminase.  alpha -GST is most suitably mesured by enzymeimmunoassay, using a solid phase antibody which is monospecific for  alpha -GST. The monospecific antibody cross-reacts with the alpha -GST dimers B1B1, B1B2 and B2B2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method which assists in the early 
diagnosis of rejection in a liver transplant recipient. In liver transplant recipients the risk of allograft rejection is 
greatest in the first few weeks after transplantation, although it can 
occur as late as the 8th post-operative month. Rejection is most 
common, however, between the 4th and 10th post-operative days. 
Prompt diagnosis is crucial to limit damage by this allogeneic immune 
response. It is also vital that the diagnosis is correct, since 
administration of augmented immunosuppression in the absence of 
rejection has its own morbidity - particularly in delaying wound 
healing and in predisposing the patient to serious infection. The most 
reliable evidence of rejection is histological but may not always be 
possible due to severe impairment of clotting. In current practice, the 
suspected diagnosis of rejection usually rests on evidence of progressive 
deterioration of liver function in the absence of any other explanation 
for this functional derangement (Calne, Ry, (1987); Liver 
Transplantation (2nd Edition), Ed Calne Ry, Grune & Stratton, Inc., 
London, 301-303). Thus, significant rejection is not diagnosed unless 
the serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated. If the 
serum transaminases and prothrombin time are also rising, then 
rejection is assumed unless there is evidence of (a) portal vein/hepatic 
artery obstruction, (b) septicaemia or (c) drug toxicity. The duration 
of treatment of rejection by augmented immunosuppression will depend 
on the improvement in liver function tests (LFTs). Patients with 
persistently raised LFTs have a poor prognosis.  
 The biochemical assessment of liver function usually includes 
measurement of plasma or serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. These cytosolic enzymes are 
released into the circulation following hepatocellular damage. The 
measurement of these aminotransferases for monitoring liver function 
has been questioned, however, as activities may be normal in patients 
with chronic liver disease. The poor sensitivity of aminotransferases in 
detecting damage in certain types of liver pathology may partly lie in 
their distribution within the liver. The periportal hepatocytes contain 
the highest concentrations of the aminotransferases but the 
centrilobular hepatocytes, which are relatively deficient in 
aminotransferases, are more susceptible to damage from hypoxia and 
toxins such as alcohol and paracetamol.

A method which assists in the early diagnosis of rejection 
in a liver transplant recipient, which method comprises measuring the 

level of 
alpha
 glutathione S-transferase (α-GST) in a plasma or serum 
sample of the liver transplant recipient, and comparing said level to a 

normal level, wherein an increase in said α-GST level in said recipient 
in the absence of or preceding any change in plasma transaminase level 

or serum transaminase level is indicative of liver transplant rejection. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the α-GST is 
measured by enzymeimmunoassay. 
A method according to Claim 2, wherein the sample is 
contacted with a solid phase bound antibody which is monospecific for 

α-GST.
