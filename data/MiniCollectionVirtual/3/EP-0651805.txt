<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method by which one can target an undesired target molecule or target antigen, preferably a protein. The method comprises the intracellular expression of an antibody capable of binding to the target. A DNA sequence is delivered to a cell, the DNA sequence contains a sufficient number of nucleotides coding for the portion of an antibody capable of binding to the target operably linked to a promoter that will permit expression of the antibody in the cell(s) of interest. The antibody is then expressed intracellularly and binds to the target, thereby disrupting the target from its normal actions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF INTRACELLULAR BINDING OF TARGET MOLECULESThe present invention is directed to a method for intracellular binding of specific molecules, preferably proteins. More specfically, this method involves the intracellular expression and subsequent use of antibodies specific for a desired molecule.Various abnormalities appear to be the result of the undesired expression of a particular molecule such as a protein. For example, many tumors are believed to be the result of the overexpression of cellular oncogenes, such as neu, myc, abl, etc. Other malignancies are believed to be the result of expression of an altered receptor. Certain illnesses are caused by the undesired cellular expression of viral proteins. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) uses mammalian cells for the preparation of viral encoded proteins including structrual proteins and regulatory enzymes. Human T-cell Leukemia virus type 1 or 2, (HTLV-1 or 2) produce tumors in infected individuals as a result of viral expression. Such viral encoded proteins can result in the assembly of virions which can in turn infect other cells.Therapeutic strategies have included the development of drugs to target the undesired proteins, means of intercellular blocking of such proteins, for example, soluble CD4, and the use of drugs which will selectively kill cells expressing the undesired proteins.Another method of treatment that has been suggested is the transfer of genetic materials into cell. For example, by receptor mediated 

gene delivery, transkaryotic implantation and viral shuttle vectors such as retroviral gene transfer. In such methods, broadly referred to as gene therapy, cells which are either deficient in a protein or produce a dysfunctional protein are hoped to be mended by introducing into the cell DNA coding for the normal gene product.In vivo gene expression has been reported following direct injection of non-infectious, non-oncogenic plasma DNA encapsulated in lyposomes [Nicolau, C, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 80:1068 (1983)] immunoliposomes [Wang, C.Y., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci 84:7851(1987)] and in a liposome/red blood cell membrane hybrid [Kaneda, Y.r et al., Science 243:375 (1989)]. Expression from a variety of calcium phosphate-precipitated gene sequences has been reported following direct intraperitoneal injection [Benvenitsy, N., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci 83:9551 (1986); Feigner, P.L., et al., Nature 349:351 (1991 )] or following transkaryotic implementation [Seldon, R.F., et al., Science 242:714
