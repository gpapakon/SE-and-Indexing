<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable settee cover or armchair cover has its back part (14) 
provided with cords sliding in a sheath on the upper side ends, and 

has two arm cover parts (18) realized with spaced out horizontal 
gatherings (24, 26, 28, 30). An excellent appearance is achieved as 

well as practical results, in that it is adjustable and it makes it 
possible to use the piece of material to the greatest advantage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to the field of settee covers or armchair 
covers adjustable for different sized settees and armchairs. The use has been known for some time of settee covers made to 
measure for the production of settees and the like. These covers 
have the disadvantage of being expensive, since they are 
craftsman-made. Recently a great success has been achieved on the market with settee 
covers and armchair covers which are completely gathered with 
elastic seams, so that they can be used on settees of greatly 
differing sizes. However these covers have not always been well 
received because of their particularly heavy appearance, because 
they have the tendency to catch crumbs and dust and because they are 
not easy to iron. For some time, therefore, studies have been going on to devise 
covers whose size can be adjusted but whose appearance is relatively 
smooth. In this respect, the applicant has devised the cover which 
is the object of the present application as claimed in claim 1. The 
cover consists of a substantially smooth seat cover part, a 
substantially smooth back cover part provided with adjuster cords at 
the upper side ends of the back, and of arms provided with gathering 
obtained with seams containing elastic thread or tape; in particular 
the elastic seams are horizontal and spaced out from each other.  With such covers the demand for the seat to be adjustable widthways 
and depthways can easily be met, notwithstanding the smooth 
appearance, by concealing any excess material which may occur in the 
folds at the side and the bottom of the back, which takes place 
automatically since the cover is provided with ties for applying to 
cushions; adjustment to the back takes place by means of very small 
gathers, by adjusting the cord at the ends of the back; while the 
gathers allow the arms to be adjusted widthways and depthways. In such a way a cover has been achieved which joins the greatest 
advantages to the smallest degree of disadvantage. Yet another advantage of the new cover lies in the fact that it can 
be made in three specially shaped pieces, making it possible to make 
the optimum use of the material and especially to employ the 
material in such a way that any motifs there may be on the border of 
the material can be positioned along the entire foot of the cover. An exemplary embodiment of the invention is given below with 
reference to the appended figures in which it is illustrated, and in 
which: Figure 1 is an axonometric illustration of a settee provided with

<CLAIMS>
A settee cover or armchair cover, characterized in that it 
comprises a seat cover part and a back cover part, the said seat 

cover part (12) not being gathered, the seat cover part (14) being 
provided with gathering cords (22) on the upper opposite side ends 

of the back, and arm parts (16, 18) provided with adjusting 
gathering.

horizontal seams which can be lengthened elastically extend on the 

front part of the arms (24', 26') also. 
A cover according to claim 1, characterized in that it is 
realized in three pieces of material joined together, one piece 

forming the seat cover part and the back cover part, and two pieces, 
each forming one arm and one side of the back.
