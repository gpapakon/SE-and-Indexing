<ABSTRACT>
A video game/communications system is disclosed which permits 
guest room guests to actively participate in video game play or to use 

other data processing/communication services. A multi-tasking master 
host computer (7) stores video games and other application programs on its hard 

disk (7A), downloads programs to an array (11) of SNES game playing engines (I to N) 
in response to guest selections. Each guest room guest room includes a 

terminal device (2) which is coupled to the guest's color television (1) and 
to a game controller (3). By pressing a game controller menu key, the 

guest room guest initiates the downloading of applications software by 
the host computer to the array of SNES engines located within the 

guest room. A downloaded applications program generate a display menu 
which appears on the guest's television (1). The display menu permits 

each guest room guest to select between various operating modes 
(identified, for example, by displayed icons), including movies, 

games, shopping, survey forms, language selection, communication/data 
processing services, etc. If a user opts for video game play, then 

the available game titles and/or descriptions thereof are displayed. 
The host computer (7) assigns a time slot to both a guest room terminal (2) 

and a SNES game playing engine for passing game play indicating key 
strokes from the room's game controller to the SNES engine. Audio and 

video outputs from each of the SNES engines is connected to a channel 
modulator that places the composite signal on an assigned frequency in 

the RF distribution system. The assignment is communicated to the 
room terminal during an initial interactive session, whereby the 

terminal tunes the TV to the proper channel for its assigned SNES 
engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to digital communications and
entertainment/video game systems. More particularly, the invention relates to a
hotel-(or cruise ship) based video game and communications system part of which
is embodied in individual guest rooms.Prior to the present invention, hotels have offered a limited degree of
in-room entertainment services. Such services have typically involved a cable TV-based
system in which a guest selects either a home box office (HBO)-type movie
and entertainment channel at no cost, or, alternatively, pay-per-view services.
Such pay-per-view systems have heretofore involved the generation of a menu
display for a user to select a desired pay-per-view option such as a one of limited
number of recently released movies.In isolated instances, certain pay-per-view services have been expanded
by establishing communication links between rooms in a hotel (or even between
rooms in different hotels) to permit guests to play trivia-type games. Such
systems operate in response to hotel guest entries via a television-type remote
controller and use satellite and/or telephone communication links.Such hotel-based entertainment systems are extremely limited in the 
range of entertainment services provided. For example, such systems do not
permit each guest to play complex video games which generate moving object
and background characters on the fly, like the Super Nintendo Entertainment
System (SNES), commercially marketed by the applicants' assignee.EP-A-0631247 is a document which falls within the terms of Article
54(3) EPC and describes a video game and communication system which is
suitable for use on an airplane.The present invention is directed to a video game/communications
system which permits hotel guests to actively participate in video game play or
to use other data processing/communication services.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
guest room communications system for generating interactive, in-room
videographic display sessions in a plurality of guest rooms comprising:
an in-room display located in each of the plurality of guest rooms;an array of videographic processing systems, the number of
videographic processing systems in said array being less than the number of
guest rooms, each videographic processing system including:
a videographics program executing processor arranged to receive
information generated during an in-room interactive videographics display
session, anda memory system, coupled to said videographics program
