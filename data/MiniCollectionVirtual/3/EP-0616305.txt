<ABSTRACT>
In a fire detector which consists of a detector insert (2) and a holder (1), in which the detector insert (2) in the inserted state completely covers the holder (1), the detector insert (2) has a movable closure device, preferably consisting of a ring (3), by means of which the detector insert (2) can be mechanically locked relative to the holder (1). Marking elements (5, 6) are provided on the detector insert (2), which elements permit the correct end position of the detector insert (2) relative to the holder (1) to be monitored.

<CLAIMS>
Fire detector comprising a detector insert (2) and a
mounting (1) into which the detector insert (2) can be

inserted and in the case of which, in the inserted state,
the detector insert (2) completely covers the mounting (1),

characterized in that the detector insert (2) has a movable
closure device (3) with which the detector insert (2) is

mechanically locked with respect to the mounting (1) and

which contains a first marking element (5) which, in the
limit position of the detector insert (2), is brought to a

unique position with respect to a second marking element (6)
provided on the lower part (4) of the detector insert (2),

as a result of which the correct limit position of the
detector insert (2) with respect to the mounting (1) can be

recognized from the outside.
Fire detector according to Patent Claim 1,
characterized in that the closure device comprises a ring

(3) which is provided at the upper end of the detector
insert (2).
Fire detector according to either of Patent Claims 1 or
2, characterized in that the marking elements (5, 6)

comprise shaping elements which are positioned alongside one
another or above one another for the purpose of recognizing

the limit position of the detector insert (2).
Fire detector according to Patent Claim 3,
characterized in that the shaping elements (5, 6) comprise

projecting ribs.
Fire detector according to one of Patent Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the marking elements (5, 6) are

distinguished in colour from the detector insert.
Fire detector according to one of Patent Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the closure device (3) has means which

are so disposed and constructed that they can actuate an 
electrical contact which generates a signal on reaching the

limit position of the detector insert (2).
Fire detector according to Patent Claim 6,
characterized in that further means are provided which are

so designed that the signal is transmitted to the central
station.
Fire detector according to one of Patent Claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that further means are provided which are

so designed that a visual signal is generated by the
electrical contact on the detector insert (2).
