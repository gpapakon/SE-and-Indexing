<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of 
producing carboxylic acid ester derivatives of formulae 
(I) and (II), which are useful, for instance, as 
intermediates for producing an anti-hypercholesterolemic 
agent having an inhibitory effect on 3-hydroxy-3-methylgulary-CoA 
Reductase (hereinafter referred to as 
HMG-CoA Reductase), in particular, through deprotection 
or the like. The present invention also relates to 
intermediates for use in the methods of producing the 
carboxylic acid ester derivatives: 
wherein R¹ and R² are independently a protective group for 
hydroxyl group, or R¹ and R² integrally constitute a 
protective group for hydroxyl groups; R³ is on alkyl group 
having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or an aryl group; and R⁴ is a 
substituted aryl group, a substituted heterocyclic group, 
a substituted vinyl group, or a substituted cycloalkenyl 
group.  wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are respectively the same as 
defined in the above formula (I). Compounds having as a substituent an (E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic 
acid moiety which is bonded thereto 
at the 7-position thereof, which are hereinafter referred 
to as 7-position-substituted (E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic 
acid compounds, serve as HMG-CoA Reductase 
inhibitors. Many methods of synthesizing such 7-position-substituted 
(E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid 
compounds, including the methods of synthesizing optical 
active compounds thereof, have been reported. The substituent at the 7-position of the (E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic 
acid moiety of the above-mentioned 
7-position-substituted (E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid 
compounds (hereinafter referred to the 7-position 
substituent) is a key substituent for the generation of 
the inhibitory activity against the HMG-CoA Reductase. 
Examples of such a 7-position substituent include a 
substituted aryl group, a substituted heterocyclic group, 
a substituted vinyl group, and a substituted cycloalkenyl  
 
group. Methods of introducing the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic 
acid unit into this 7-position substituent can be roughly 
classified into the following three methods: 
(I) A method of introducing a C3 carbon chain into 
the 7-position substituent, followed by the introduction 
of a C4 carbon chain. As the C3 carbon chain, 2-propenal 
or a 2-propene acid derivative is employed in this 
method. 
This method includes, for instance, the following 
specific methods: 
(I-1) A method of introducing as the C4 carbon 
chain a β-keto ester (J. Med. Chem. 1986, 29, 170, J. 
Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 5752).
