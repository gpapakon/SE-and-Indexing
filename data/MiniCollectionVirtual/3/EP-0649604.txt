<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for separating lighter particles such as 
lamina containing little or no stem from tobacco particles 

containing in threshed leaf tobacco which comprises a 
plurality of tobacco particle separating units (212, 214), 

each including a separation chamber and each having a fan 
system (218) for establishing a generally upward air flow 

therein. A tobacco particle projecting mechanism (220, 
222) is provided in each chamber for projecting, in 

cooperation with additional air flow provided at the 
projecting side (240) of the separation chamber, tobacco 

particles across the generally upward air flow therein with 
each having structure (430, 432, 290) for directing tobacco 

particles in cooperating relation therewith to be projected 
thereby. Mechanisms are provided for receiving the lighter 

particles carried upwardly by the air flow, the heavier 
particles moving downwardly within the air flow within each 

chamber and discharging the particles therefrom. The 
plurality of tobacco particle separating units are mounted 

in side-by-side relation in a row which includes an initial 
end unit (212) and a final end unit (214) with the tobacco 

particle directing structure (266) of the initial end unit 
arranged to receive a supply of threshed leaf tobacco and 

the tobacco particle directing structure (276) of the 
remaining of the plurality of units being directly 

connected to receive tobacco particle through a tobacco 
particle opening (272) in the receiving side of the chamber 

of the preceding unit so that the tobacco particles 
projec
ted across the chamber of the preceding unit which 
move across the air flow therein and pass through the 

opening form a tobacco particle supply directed to an 
associated projecting mechanism (222) by an associated 

tobacco particle directing structure (276).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to separating apparatus and
methods, in particular but not exclusively for
separating threshed leaf tobacco, and more particulary
to apparatus of this type which will improve the
separation characteristics while minimizing damage to
the lamina particles.The invention is particularly concerned with
the separation of threshed tobacco leaves by air
stream separation into (1) lighter particles such as
lamina with little or no stem, and (2) heavier
particles such as stem with or without attached
lamina. Air flotation type separation apparatus is
known, and basically includes a separation chamber
having opposed sides and a closed fan system for
establishing a generally upward flow of air within the
chamber between the sides thereof. Successive
particles from a supply of threshed leaf tobacco are
projected from one side of the chamber across the
chamber so that (1) lighter particles are carried
upwardly by the airflow within the chamber, and (2)
heavier particles move by gravity downwardly through
the airflow within the chamber. A discharge system is
provided in the upper portion of the chamber for
receiving the upwardly carried lighter particles and
discharging them from the chamber, and a separate
discharge system is provided in the lower portion of
the chamber for receiving the heavier particles moving
downwardly by gravity and discharging the same from
the chamber.In US-A-4,465,194, there
is disclosed an apparatus of this type in which means
is provided for further handling and separating
projected particles which travel entirely across the
chamber and for effecting a final separation of 
lighter particles entrained with the particles
received in the heavier particle discharge system.
The lighter particles separated in the apparatus are
frequently subsequently shredded into a form useful in
cigarettes.In the use of apparatus of the type herein
contemplated, it is often the case that the heavier
particle fraction discharging from the apparatus
contains lighter particles clumped therewith, which
did not get separated in the operation of the
apparatus. Consequently, it is often the practice to
set up an intervening power-operated system for
delivering the heavier particle discharge from one
apparatus to the inlet of a similar apparatus as the
threshed leaf tobacco supply thereof. In this way, a
better final separation can be achieved. However, due
to the additional handling by the intervening power-operated
sytem, it is acheived in a manner which tends
to effect damage to the lamina. In
