<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of finely divided 
particulate materials to improve the colour of granular 
products which comprise clay. The finely divided 
particulate material comprises a mixture of sodium 
aluminosilicate and silica in a defined ratio. The silica 
used is hydrophobic silica, preferably fumed hydrophobic 
silica. The ratio of sodium aluminosilicate to silica is 
from about 100:1 to about 5:1, preferably from 20:1 to 4:1, 
and most preferably around 10:1. It is known that clay particles are useful components in 
detergent compositions, largely due to the effect of 
softening fabrics during the laundering process. In 
particular clay particles have been incorporated into 
detergent products which are added during the wash cycle 
(rather than being added later during the rinse cycle) for 
the purposes of softening through the wash.  However, one of the disadvantages of clay is that it tends 
to give an off-white colour to the particles into which it 
is incorporated. This means that when a finished 
composition is made by blending its various components 
together, the particles which contain the clay are easily 
distinguished from particles which do not contain clay due 
to the difference in whiteness. This is readily apparent 
to the consumer who will generally find such product 
properties undesirable or even unacceptable. Furthermore, 
the problem becomes increasingly evident when particles are 
used which comprise high levels of clay. Various ways of addressing this problem have been proposed 
in the prior art:
 
GB 2 120 293, published 30th November 1983, and GB 2 121 
843, published on 4th January, 1984, both describe the 
addition of dyes or pigments to the liquid binder which is 
used to agglomerate the clay particles. This results in 
coloured clay "speckles", thereby masking the poor 
whiteness of the clay particles. The use of flow aids is 
also mentioned, but no indication is given of how suitable 
flow aids may be chosen. EP A 353 994, published 7th February, 1990, discloses base 
granules of smectite clay coated with white inorganic 
material. Suitable inorganic materials are kaolin clay, 
calcium carbonate or titanium dioxide. EP A 385 748, published 5th September, 1990, discloses the 
use of whitening particulates (e.g. silica, calcite) to 
coat the surface of the clay particles. However, where whitening particulates have been suggested 
in the prior art, they are generally not active in the 
laundry process, and they need to be present at relatively 
high
