<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides for a refrigeration lubricant for use with R-134a 
refrigerant. The lubrication composition of the invention combines a polyalkylene 

glycol synthetic lubricant or a polyolester synthetic lubricant with conventional 
mineral oil. The composition has enhanced lubricity which is unexpected in view of 

the fact that mineral oil is known to be incompatible with R-134a refrigerant. The 

lubricant compositions of the present invention are useful to replace the R-12 
refrigerant lubricants which are presently in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention relates to a lubricating oil composition which is 
blended with a refrigerant, particularly R-134a or other HFC refrigerants for use in 
a conventional compression-type refrigerator or air conditioning unit. The 
composition is particularly useful for use in an automotive air conditioning unit. In conventional compression-type refrigeration and/or air conditioning devices 
(including heat pumps) a refrigerant is compressed and circulated through the device 
while being subjected to alternating cycles of compression and expansion. In order 
to provide proper internal lubrication, particularly within the compressor, a lubricant 
is conventionally formulated with the refrigerant so that it can be circulated through 
the device along with the refrigerant. A refrigerant which is frequently used, especially for automotive applications, 
is CFC-12, which is also known as R-12. The R-12 refrigerant is identified 
chemically as dichlorodifluoromethane. The lubricants used with the R-12 refrigerant 
are conventional grade mineral oils which fall within the categories of paraffinic, 
naphthenic and alkyl benzene oils. These mineral oils are useful with the R-12 
refrigerant because they have similar solubility characteristics so that they are 
miscible with the R-12 refrigerant. In order for such formulations to be effective, it 
is essential for the lubricant to be compatible with the refrigerant. The use of 
lubricants which are not compatible with the refrigerant results in unacceptable 
compressor life in compression-type refrigerators and air conditioners. This problem 
is particularly troublesome in automotive air conditioners because the compressors are 
often not separately lubricated and, consequently, a mixture of refrigerant and 
lubricant circulates through the entire system. It is well known that in order for a  
 
lubricant to be compatible with a refrigerant, the lubricant must be miscible with the 
refrigerant. Although the R-12 refrigerant has highly desirable physical properties which 
make it useful as a refrigerant, its present use is highly discouraged because of its 
role in the depletion of ozone in the upper atmosphere. The ozone depletion potential 
of R-12 and other CFC refrigerants has led to the imposition of many environmental 
regulations limiting the use of such refrigerants which are known to deplete the upper 
atmosphere of ozone. In 1987, the signatory nations to the Montreal Protocol agreed 
to freeze production and use of CFCs at 1986 levels and then
