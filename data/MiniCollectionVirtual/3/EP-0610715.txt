<ABSTRACT>
A membrane module is described for the removal of gaseous substances from a gas stream, which module comprises a multiplicity of flat membrane pockets made of a gas-permeable, liquid-tight material. The pockets are arranged in parallel to each other and in parallel to the direction of flow of the gas stream. The membrane pockets contain a liquid reaction mixture or a suspension of microorganisms which react with certain constituents of the gas stream flowing past the pockets. The pockets have as an essential constituent a surrounding frame which is joined on both sides to the membrane material. The frame has inlet and outlet bore holes which are each joined to the interior of the pocket. When the frames are stacked one above the other, these bore holes come to lie one above the other and thus form inlet and outlet ducts via which the reaction mixture or suspension of microorganisms situated in the pockets can be renewed and taken off. The membrane module forms a compact unit built up from simple components, which unit can be easily assembled and can be used in a versatile manner.

A membrane module for removing gaseous substances from a gas stream
consisting of a plurality of flat membrane pockets made of a gas-permeable, liquid-tight

material and disposed parallel to each other and parallel to the direction of flow
of a gas flowing against the membrane module, the membrane pockets being adapted

to receive a liquid reaction mixture or a suspension of microorganisms and be
charged via an inlet and emptied via an outlet, and spacers being provided between

the membrane pockets laterally to the direction of flow of the gas stream to define a
minimum distance between the membrane pockets, thereby forming free spaces

through which the gas stream can flow,

characterized in that each membrane pocket (12) has a flat, peripheral frame
(27) determining the outside contour of the pocket, and said frame (27) is covered on

both sides with the membrane material which is connected with the frame (27) in
sealing fashion, and the frame (27) has at least one inlet bore (32) and at least one

outlet bore (34) perpendicular to the plane of the frame which penetrate the membrane
and are connected between the membranes by a further bore or a groove with

the interior enclosed by the membranes and the frame (27), and a plurality of membrane
pockets (12) are stacked in such a way that the inlet bores (32) and the outlet

bores (34) are located one above the other in each case and form continuous channels,
the spacers disposed laterally between the membrane pockets being formed as

seals which have bores corresponding in size and arrangement to the inlet and outlet
bores (32; 34) in the frames (27) of the membrane pockets (12), and the stack is

ended by a cover plate (18) and a baseplate (20), inlet channels (22) and outlet channels
(24) being formed in the cover plate and/or baseplate to communicate with the

inlet bores (32), on the one hand, and with the outlet bores (34), on the other hand.
The membrane module of claim 1, characterized in that the frames (27) are
rectangular and the inlet and outlet bores (32; 34) are disposed in opposite frame

pieces (28; 30).
The membrane module of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the frame pieces
(28; 30) are interconnected by transverse bars (32). 
The membrane module of any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a plurality
of inlet bores (32) are disposed in one frame piece (28) and a plurality of outlet

bores (34) in the opposite piece.
The membrane module of any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
membrane material is welded or glued to the frame (27) on both sides.
The membrane module of any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a supporting
structure (16) is disposed in the space between the membrane pockets, said

structure defining the distance between the membrane pockets over the total surface
of the pocket and hardly hindering flow through the free space between the membrane

pockets.
The membrane module of claim 6, characterized in that the supporting
structure is a stiff foil (16) with a zigzag profile.
The membrane module of claim 6, characterized in that the supporting
structure is an open-pore structure of bending-resistant fibers or wire.
An apparatus for removing gaseous substances from a gas stream, characterized
in that a plurality of the membrane modules of any of claims 1 to 8 are disposed

in a housing in such a way that a gas stream can flow through them in parallel
or successively.
