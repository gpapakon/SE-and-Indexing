<ABSTRACT>
An operator/facsimile interface includes an Undo key 
(62) that enables an immediately previous action to be 

reversed, thereby allowing an operator to correct an 
erroneous entry or a mistakenly commenced operation with 

one key press. The operator/facsimile interface further 
enables entry of alpha-numeric data from a telephone-style 

keyboard (58) . Alteration of displayed alpha-numeric 
characters may be accomplished by actuation of 

arrow keys (78), or sequential key presses of an alpha-numeric 
key. A displayed alpha-numeric character may 

be entered by actuation of an arrow key (78), an Enter 
key (64) or a different alpha-numeric key. Completion 

of an alpha-numeric entry may be signaled by actuation 
of a Start key (66) or Enter key (64). 
 
The * and # keys in the telephone-style keyboard (58) 
are assigned Yes and No functions, respectively, when 

the facsimile interface is in an alpha-numeric entry 
mode, thereby allowing immediate operator response to a 

displayed query. A report key (74) enables a selective 
print-out of transmission and reception record data only 

when desired by the operator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a telecommunication unit, for
example to an operator interface for a facsimile that
provides multiple, alternative, input paths to
accomplish procedures employed by the facsimile.Our copending European patent applications EP-A-0,649,239
and EP-A-0,649,243, filed the same day as this
application, disclose related subject matter.Once a facsimile machine has been properly set up by the
operator, it operates in a substantially automatic mode
to accomplish its connection, transmission and sign-off
functions. If the facsimile includes a "one-touch"
feature wherein actuations of each of a plurality of
single buttons accesses prestored telephone numbers, the
transmitting fax machine, upon actuation of one such
button, automatically dials the remote telephone number
and transmits a standard recognition signal which the
receiving facsimile acknowledges. Then, the
transmitting and receiving facsimiles send short
messages back and forth to select the highest speed
possible before sending the documents. No action is
required of an operator during this action, at 
either the sending or the receiving end. When a
transmission is completed, the facsimile units
automatically disconnect and the receiving facsimile
provides hard copy for the operator.While transmission and reception operations of a facsimile
are highly automated and require little or no operator
input, such "user-friendliness" is often not manifest when
an operator wishes to input instructions or data into the
facsimile via a control panel. Facsimile/operator
interfaces typically recognize only a single sequence of
operations to accomplish a given input task. To determine
the correct procedure sequence, the operator must refer to
an instruction manual and follow its instructions slavishly
to assure proper accomplishment of a desired task. Any
deviation from the required sequence of operations will
prevent the accomplishment of the desired task.Facsimile operator panels employ multiple keys that enable
multiple functions to be accomplished - assuming the
operator is aware of the proper sequence of key
activations. Because of both cost and size restraints,
little directory information is contained on the face of
the operator panel other than short key names. Certain key
names are ambiguous and lead to user confusion as to the
exact function to be performed by the key.For any given facsimile task, there are usually a number of
different "reasonable" approaches an operator might take to
accomplish the task - assuming that the operator

<CLAIMS>
A telecommunication unit including an operator
panel (50) with a keyboard (54) and a display panel

(54), said operator panel (50) including an Undo key
(62) and processor means (10) responsive to a user

actuation of said Undo key (62) to reverse at least an
immediately previous user-commanded action and to cause

said telecommunication unit to return to a state in
existence just prior to said immediately previous

operator-commanded action; wherein when said immediately
previous user-commanded action results in a

displayed cursor on said display panel (54) being
located at a character position within a name or number

field, said character position being other than a last-displayed
character in said name or number field, said

processor means (10) is operative to respond to actuation

of said Undo key (62) by moving said cursor to
said last displayed character position in said name or

number field, in lieu of causing said telecommunication
unit to return to a state in existence just prior to

said immediately previous operator-commanded action.
The telecommunication unit as recited in claim 1,
wherein said processor means (10) is operative respond

to a repeat actuation of said Undo key (62) by removing
a character displayed at a character position at which

said cursor is located and by moving said cursor back
one character position of said display panel (54).
The telecommunication unit as recited in claim 1 or
2, wherein said operator panel (50) includes a plurality

of arrow keys (78), and wherein said processor means
(10) is operative to respond to user actuation of said

Undo key (62), after one or more successive actuations
of an arrow key (78), by returning said telecommunications 

unit to a state in existence just prior to said
one or more successive actuations of said arrow key

(78).
The telecommunication unit as recited in any
preceding claim, wherein said telecommunication unit is

a facsimile unit and said operator panel (50) includes
an alpha-numeric keyboard (58) and an Enter key (64),

wherein actuation of said Enter key (64) immediately
after actuation of a key in said alpha-numeric keyboard
