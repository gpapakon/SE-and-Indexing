<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for regenerating an adsorbent which is freed by a hot gas of a medium adsorbed in the adsorbent, in particular humidity, and is subsequently cooled by means of a gas stream. To avoid undesired heating up of the exhaust gas stream and/or of the drying air, it is provided that, for cooling, a gas stream emerging from the hot adsorbent (26) is passed through a heat accumulator (50) for taking up the heat from the hot adsorbent (26) and, after the heat accumulator (50), is passed back through the adsorbent (26). Furthermore, a device suitable for carrying out the method is specified.

Method of operating a dry-air dryer, wherein air is circulated through
the moist matter (2) and via a moisture adsorption means (26), wherein the

moisture adsorption means (26) is regenerated by hot gas in the event of
moisture saturation, wherein the hot gas is outside air which is conducted to

the adsorption means (26) through a regeneration pipe (32,33,34,35) and is
thereby heated by a heater (7), wherein the ho
t gas absorbs the moisture
from the adsorption means when flowing therethrough and is discharged

outwardly, wherein the adsorption means (26) is cooled without drawing-in
fresh outside air subsequently to the regeneration, wherein the outside air,

remaining in the regeneration pipe (32,33,34,35) after the regeneration, is
circulated in a regeneration circuit (20,35,38,34,32,30), which is switched-on

via valves (31,37), is disposed parallel to the dry-air circuit and is separated
from said dry-air circuit via additional valves (14,29), the adsorption means

(26) and an apparatus (50) for cooling the circulating air being disposed in
said regeneration circuit, 
characterised in that
 the regeneration circuit includes
a heat storage unit (50) as the cooling means, 
in that
 the outside air, used for
regeneration purposes, is conducted through the heat storage unit for

preliminary warming prior to its being heated in the heater (7), and 
in that
 the
outside air, used for cooling purposes, in the closed regeneration circuit

(20,35,38,34,32,30) is circulated repeatedly through the heat storage unit (50)
and the adsorption means (26) until the adsorption means (26) is cooled

sufficiently.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 pieces of glass
and/or pieces of metal and/or stones are used in the heat storage unit (50) as

the storage medium.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 balls of material are
used as the storage medium in the heat storage unit (50), the diameter of said 

balls being advantageously selected to be less than 10 mm, preferably
between 10 mm and 2 mm, in cross-section.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that

the quantity of storage medium is so selected that the product of the weight of
the storage material and the specific heat thereof is approximately identical to

or greater than the product of the weight of the adsorption means (26) to be
cooled and the specific heat thereof.
