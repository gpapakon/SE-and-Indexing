from a monitoring center if to be unlockied, a code-identifying 

control device (6) electrically connected to the 
code-storing device (22) for identifying whether there is an 

input code identical to the preset code and for generating an 
unlocking signal if said codes are identical, and an electric 

lock circuit (23) electrically connected to the code-identifying 
control device (6) for unlocking the electric 

lock (37) after the electric lock circuit (23) receives the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an electric code 
lock set, and more particularly to one used for cross 
connect cabinets or wiring cabinets. Most of telecommunication cabinets are without a locking 
device so that the wire tapping, illegal connecting or 
illeagal disconnecting can happen easily. This situation is 
harmful to both the telephone subscriber and the Post 
Telephone and Telegragh (PTT). Some conventional cabinets are to be unlocked by keys of the 
same size and shape. Thus, with only one key, a key holder 
can unlock all cabinets with the same keyhole type. Although 
with locks, this kind of cabinets still suffer easily from 
wire tapping, illegal connecting or illegal disconnecting. If 
the cabinets are locked by electric code locks of the same 
code, there still is the similar problem. There still are conventional cabinets locked by keys of 
different sizes and shapes. Because the cabinets are of a 
large quantity and because the different key holders to a 
specific cabinet are not always from the same place, the 
management of keys is difficult and inconvenient. 
Conventional electric code card locks of different codes 
still have the similar problem. There further are conventional cabinets with electric code 
locks electrically connected to a fixed power supply and a 
keyboard for inputting therefrom an input code. Because the 
power supply for the electric code locks cannot always be 
desiredly obtained, there is a power-supply problem. Because  
 
the keyboard is mounted on the surface of the cabinets and 
prone to be damaged by a curious person, there is a repairing 
and maintaining problem. Because the code for the electric 
code lock is fixed and can not be changed, there is a 
security problem. It is therefore attempted by the Applicants to deal with the 
above situation encountered by the prior art. The primary object of the present invention is to provide an 
electric code lock set capable of being energized by a non-fixed 
power supply. Another object of the present invention is to provide an 
electric lock set obtaining an input code from a portable 
unlocking device, which thus, frees from being damaged by 
a curious fellow or kid. A further object of the present invention is to provide a 
well-monitored and well-protected electric code lock set 
connected to a monitoring center which monitors whether the 
electric code lock set is locked or unlocked and gives a 
warning signal when the electric code lock set is undesiredly 
unlocked. A yet object of the present

<CLAIMS>
An electric code lock set adapted to be mounted in a 
telecommunication cabinet compring a code-storing device (22) 

for storing therein a preset code, an electric lock (37) 
energized by an electric lock power source if to be unlocked, 

a code-identifying control device (6) electrically connected 
to the code-storing device (22) for identifying whether 

there is an input code identical to the preset code and for 
generating an unlocking signal if the codes are identical, 

and an electric lock circuit (23) electrically connected to 
the code-identifying control device (6) for unlocking the 

electric lock (37) after the electric lock circuit (23) 
receives the unlocking signal, characteri
zed in that the 
electric lock power source is selected from one of a 

portable unlocking device power source (34) and an electric 
power source from a monitoring center. 
An electric code lock set according to Claim 1 
characterized in that the preset code is preset by the 

monitoring center.
