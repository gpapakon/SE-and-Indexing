<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for holding a substantially flat element, 
particularly for suspending a bag (2), 


a) with a holding part (3, 3') and 
b) connecting means (5, 5') which can be linked to the 
element, 
c) wherein the connecting means are so constructed that the 
holding device (1) can be linked to the element (2) in 

at least two different positions of use, and 
d) wherein the connecting means have two retaining fingers 
(5, 5') which are provided at the two ends of a 

connecting piece (4) and extend in opposite directions,
 
characterised in that 
e) hooks (3, 3') which are constructed integrally with the 
connecting piece are provided on both ends of the 

connecting piece (4), 
f) and that each hook is formed in one piece by the 
following parts: 
 
a first part (3a, 3'a) which extends substantially perpendicular from 

the point of attachment on the connecting piece (4); a second 
part (3b, 3'b) which extends parallel to the connecting piece 

(4) and forms a T with the first part (3a, 3'a); a third part 
(3c, 3'c) which from the inner end of the second part (3b, 

3'b) extends substantially perpendicular away from the 
connecting piece (4); a fourth part (3d, 3'd) which adjoins 

the third part and extends outwards parallel to the connecting 
piece (4); and a fifth part (3e, 3'e) which extends at least  

 
in part substantially perpendicular to the connecting piece 

(4). 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the 
holding device (1) is of substantially flat construction. 
Device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that in a first position of use the holding 

device (1) which is linked to the element (2) extends 
substantially parallel with respect to the flat element and in 

a second position of use it extends substantially transversely 
with respect thereto. 
Device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the holding device (1) is produced from 

flexible elastic plastics material, preferably polypropylene. 
Device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the holding device has at least one pin 

(7, 7') extending substantially transversely with respect to 
the holding device. 
Device as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the 
pin (7, 7') is provided on one end with a barb (7a). 
Device as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the 
pin (7, 7') has a thickened head (7b). 
Device as claimed in one of Claims 5, 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the pin is held in a hole in the holding 

device. 
Element of flat construction, particularly a bag (2), 
with a holding device, chara
cterised by the holding device (1) 
as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 8, wherein the connecting 

means of the holding device co-operate with corresponding  
 

connecting means on the flat element. 
Element as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that the 
corresponding connecting means are formed by two openings.
