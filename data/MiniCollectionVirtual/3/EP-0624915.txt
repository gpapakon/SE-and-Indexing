<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for securing a
tester device to a battery in which the tester device
forms an integral part of the label encasing the
battery.Batteries are generally stored for various periods
of time before being put into use. The batteries can
be stored by the seller and frequently when purchased
they are again stored by the buyer prior to being put
to use. It is therefore desired to have some sort of
testing means for determining if a battery has
sufficient charge to operate a desired device.
Initially, separate battery testers were developed
which could measure the strength remaining in the
battery. Recently battery testers have been developed
that either are included in the battery package or
assembled in the label secured to the battery. The
testers generally indicate the capacity remaining in
the battery.U.S. Patent No. 4,702,564 discloses a device for
testing a battery, particularly a small, portable
battery, comprising a flexible, transparent substrate
on which is deposited a narrow band of a black light
absorbing material. A conductive material, which may
taper outwardly in opposite directions from a central
point to a pair of outer terminals, is then deposited
atop the substrate on the same side of the substrate as
the absorber layer or on the opposite side of the
substrate as the absorber layer. A layer of a 
chloesteric liquid crystal material is then deposited
on the substrate on the opposite side from the black
absorber layer or over the absorber layer. The
conductive material is an epoxy cement-based conductor,
preferably silver, printed or painted directly on the
substrate. An indicator scale is located along
sections of the conductive material. To test a dry
cell battery, the terminal ends of the conductive
material are placed in contact with the battery
terminals, causing a current to flow which heats the
conductive material, the heat generated being the most
intense at the central point and radiating outwardly.
The heat is transferred through the thin substrate to
the liquid crystal layer which results in a color
change in the liquid crystal. The traverse of the
color change along the length of the indicator scale,
outwardly from the center point, is proportional to the
current or voltage output or the condition of the
battery to be tested and can be read on the indicator
scale which is calibrated accordingly. The tester also
includes means for determining the amp-hours or life of
a battery.U.S. Patent No. 5,015,544 discloses a battery
strength indicating and switch

A method for preparing and attaching a battery test label to a battery having a first
