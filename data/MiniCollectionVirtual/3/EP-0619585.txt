<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic material comprised of FeRhGaSi 
containing Rhodium at a concentration of 1.0 to 6.0 

atomic percent, has improved saturation magnetization and 
permeability acquired by magnetic annealing of sputtered 

FeRhGaSi in thin film form between 350°C and 600°C. The 
FeRhGaSi material has an increased Curie temperature 

compared to FeGaSi material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to high 
density, high data rate recording systems such as modern 
rotary recorders and, more particularly, to magnetic 
alloys used in the fabrication of inductive metal 
laminated (ML) magnetic heads. High density, high data rate recording systems, 
such as video and data recorders, require head materials 
with a high saturation magnetization (4πMS), high 
permeability (µ) in the MHz frequency range, good 
tribological properties such as high wear resistance and 
high corrosion resistance. Monolithic ferrite has been a material for 
record heads used in both magnetic disk and tape drives 
when the coercivity of the recording medium is less than 
700 Oersteds (Oe) and the highest frequency is about ten 
megahertz (MHz). However, due to the need for high 
saturation magnetization and high frequency response, 
ferrite is not a good choice for newer applications. Historically, Permalloy (NiFe) has been the 
magnetic material of choice for a record head of the thin 
film type. However, NiFe has poor wear resistance, and 
has a relatively low resistivity, causing permeability to 
decrease rapidly at higher frequencies due to eddy 
current losses. Relative to monolithic ferrite, a sputter-deposited 
Sendust (FeSiAl) Alloy film offers a higher 
saturation magnetization, about 10 kilogauss (kG). 
Furthermore, a Sendust alloy has a relatively high 
resistivity and better wear resistance than Permalloy.  More recently, however, FeGaSi has been 
disclosed as a crystalline magnetic alloy having, 
compared to Sendust, both a higher saturation 
magnetization (about 13 kG) and lower coercivity (about 
0.1 Oe). (See Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 61, 
No. 8, Pages 3514 through 3519.) However, similar to 
Sendust, FeGaSi alloy films suffer from the disadvantage 
that their permeability, although almost constant in a 
range from 1 to 10 MHz, decreases rapidly for higher 
frequencies due to eddy current losses. Following these developments, an FeGaSi-based 
alloy film having Ru as an additive is known in the art. 
FeRuGaSi has higher saturation magnetization than FeSiAl, 
although somewhat lower than FeGaSi, and an excellent 
soft magnetic property (low coercivity) and good wear 
resistance. This (FeRuGaSi) alloy was shown to be 
suitable for recording in a high frequency range near 100 
MHz. (See Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 64, No. 2, 
Pages 772 through 779.) A need has therefore been felt for a magnetic 
core material which has as good or better soft magnetic 
properties (i.e.,
