<ABSTRACT>
A chain conveyor or scraper, in particular for sewage installations, has at least one chain (5) with large links guided on chain wheels (10) of which at least one is drivable. The chain links (11) and the parts (20, 21) of the chain wheels that engage them are designed as plastic parts. The mutually identical chain links (11) have a fork-like base shape, engage the following link between its web ends (14) and are provided with a bushing that links the chain webs at their base. The chain links are mutually linked by means of chain bolts (15) that extend through the bushing and the web ends. In order to improve guidance and diminish wear, the chain wheels (10) have, besides the teeth (22) for engaging the bushing (12), further teeth (20, 23, 24) arranged at both sides on the web outer sides of the chains (5) which supply an auxiliary guidance of the chain and engage projecting chain bolt ends or catches (16) arranged thereon.

<CLAIMS>
A chain conveyor or scraper, more particularly for 
sewage installations, comprising at least one large-link 

chain (5) guided over chain wheels (7, 8, 9, 10) 
at least one (10) of which is drivable, the links (11) 

and the parts (20, 21) of the chain wheels (7, 8, 9, 
10) in engagement therewith being plastics parts, the 

links (11), which are similar to one another, having a 
fork shape and a bush (12) at the base connects the 

arms (13) of the forks and engages between the ends of 
the arms of the next link (11) and is connected 

therewith via link bolts (15) extending through the 
bush (12) and the arm ends, conveying or scraping 

elements (6) being incorporated in the chain and the 
chain wheels (10) having teeth (22) designed for 

engagement with the bushes (12), characterised in that 
in addition to the central teeth (22) for engagement 

with the bushes (12), the chain wheels (10) have other, 
outer teeth (23, 24) disposed on the outsides of the 

arms of the chains (5) for engagement with projecting 
link-bolt ends or cams (16) mounted thereon, the arms 

(13) of the links (11) being automatically aligned in 
transit in the passage gaps (25, 26) or slots formed 

between the central teeth (22) and the outer teeth (23, 
24). 
A chain conveyor or scraper according to claim 1, 
characterised in that rolling and guiding surfaces for 

the edges of the arms (13) of the links (11) are 
provided at the base of the passage gaps (25, 26) for 

the arms (13) disposed between the outer teeth (23, 24) 
and the central teeth (22).  

 
A chain conveyor or scraper according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the cams (16) disposed on 

the link bolts (15) are mounted for rotation with the 
link bolts in the bushes (12). 
A chain conveyor or scraper according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the cams (16) disposed on 

the link bolts (15) are in the form of rollers 
rotatable on the link bolts. 
A chain conveyor or scraper according to any of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the teeth (22 - 

24) of the chain wheel are separate components (21) 
secured to a supporting disc. 
A chain conveyor or scraper according to claim 5, 
characterised in that each component (21) comprises a 

central tooth (22), associated outer teeth (23, 24) 
with passage gaps (25, 26) for the link arms (13, 14), 

and a groove (28) for receiving the edge of the bearing 
disc on the side remote from the teeth (22, 23, 24). 
A chain conveyor or scraper according to claims 5 
and 6, characterised in that in the place where the 

components (21) having teeth (22, 23, 24) are attached, 
the bearing disc has a non-circular contour so as to 

form supporting surfaces for these components (21) and 
for forming the base (27) of the receiving groove (28). 
A chain conveyor or scraper according to any of 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that at least some of 

the links (11) in the longitudinal central region of 
the arms (13) have guide and supporting surfaces (18)  

 
for attaching a block (30) for retaining a conveying or 

scraping element (6), and also have openings or 
passages (36) for elements securing the retaining 

block. 
A chain conveyor or scraper according to any of 
claims 1 to 8, characterised in that at least some of 

the chain wheels (7 - 10) have an odd number of teeth 
(20) or groups of outer or central teeth (22, 23, 24), 

disposed in succession at half the pitch determined by 
the length of the links.
