A device for masking a part of the surface (5) of an article
(20) having a band (6) which is formed from two strands (9, 10), wherein

one of the strands (9, 10) is elastic, and having a masking cover (2, 15)
which is disposed at an inward position between the strands (9, 10) of

the elastic band (6), wherein the strands (9, 10) form the outer border
of the device (1) and define the part of the surface (5) which is to be

masked, characterised in that both strands (9, 10) are elastic and are of
such a nature that a wedge-shaped gap (8) is formed between an exposed

surface region (7) and the region of the band (6), which lies thereon,
wherein the outer border of the band (6) becomes taut upon being fitted

by virtue of tensile stresses to adopt an established position and is
shortened upon being removed with instantaneous simultaneous detachment

of the band (6).
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that the band
(6) is made from chlorinated latex material.
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that the band
(6) is produced from a plastics material, in particular soft polyvinyl

chloride.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in
that the band (6) is of a substantially round cross-section.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in
that the strands (9, 10) of the band (6) have two jaws (29, 30) with a

channel (31) therebetween.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in
that the band (6) is an annular tensile band. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in
that the ends (11, 11') of the first strand (9) are connected to the ends

(12, 12') of the second strand (10) and form an annular tensile band.
A device according to claim 6 or claim 7 characterised in that
the masking cover (15) is elastic.
A device according to claim 2 and claim 8 characterised in that
the masking cover (15) is made integrally with the strands (9, 10) from a

chlorinated latex material which is thin in comparison with the diameter
of the strands (9, 10).
A device according to claim 9 characterised in that the masking
cover (15) has a compensating region (16) which is in the form of a fold

and which extends substantially centrally in the longitudinal direction
of the device (1).
Use of a device according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised
in that when painting the article (20) the two elastic strands (9, 10) of

the band (6) are fitted to the surface (5) to be masked, under tension,
forming a separation line, and are removed, with relief of the tension,

with an applied coat of paint (26) being sheared off.
