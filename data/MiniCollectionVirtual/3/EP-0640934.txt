<ABSTRACT>
An OCR system 10 classifies an input image vector of 
an unclassified symbol with respect to a library of T 

template image vectors of pre-classified characters. Each 
template vector is in the form of a sequence of elements 

representing the image contrast level of a pixel within 
the character defined by that template vector. Each 

template element is part of the image background or 
foreground or transition ground between the background 

and foreground. The input vector, like the template 
vectors, is also in the form of a sequence of elements. 

However, in the input vector, the elements represent an 
image contrast level signal component defining the symbol 

within the image of the unclassified symbol and a 
greyscale noise component. Each input element is also 

part of the background or foreground or transition 
ground. The input vector and at least one of the T 

template vectors are entered into a classifier device 18. 
The input vector is classified based on the backgrounds, 

foregrounds, and transition grounds. The presence of 
transition ground in the input vector and the template 

vector produces a robust classification response with a 
more uniform correlation coefficient between repeated 

classifications of the same input symbol. The classifier 
device may be a distance function classifier or a neural 

network classifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to OCR classification of 
input images against a library of template images, and 
more particularly to such classification employing 
transition ground data (greyscale signal) along with 
background data and foreground data (binary signal). Heretofore, unclassified input images and pre-classified 
template images were digitized to eliminate 
the greyscale content of the underlying data. The 
resulting binary inputs and templates were "clean" images 
with minimum data to be processed. These prior art 
systems were generally slow by today's standards with 
limited memory. Greyscale was treated as noise not 
signal. Digitization of the images eliminated the greyscale 
noise, along with the greyscale signal (transition ground 
data). Transition ground is the thin region of variable 
intensity along the edge within an image between the 
background region and the foreground region. The level of 
the transition ground signal progressively changes from 
background level to foreground level. Transition ground, 
like greyscale noise, forms part of the non-binary 
content of the image, and is lost during digitization.  
 The removal of greyscale noise permitted the 
classification process to provide higher correlation 
coefficients. Greyscale noise was generally non-reproducible 
between repeated classification of the same 
character, and merely detracted from the proper match of 
the input symbol with the templates. Unfortunately, the 
resulting classification response of these prior binary 
systems was "brittle" due to the loss of transition 
ground signal. The correlation coefficient was based on a 
suitable distance criterion such as the "Hamming" distance 
between the input symbol and the matching template. The 
distance and resulting correlation coefficients were nonuniform 
between repeated classifications of the same 
printed image. A paper by Lui et al (Proceedings of the International 
Joint Conference on Neural Network, Singapore, Nov 18-21 1991, 
Vol 1 of 3 18 November 1991 Institute of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers pages 325-330 entitled "Character 
Recognition on Gray Level image Using Neural Networks) 
describes an OCR technique for recognising gray level 
characters wherein windows of pixels define input nodes for a 
neural network to enable portions of the character image to be 
defined.  
 It is therefore an object of this invention to 
provide an OCR classification method which employs 
background and foreground binary data and transition 
ground greyscale data. In
