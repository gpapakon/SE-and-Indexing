<ABSTRACT>
When printing images on a photosensitive material, 
not only ordinary prints but index prints are automatically 

printed in the same size as the ordinary prints for higher 
work efficiency. At the projection exposure stage, 

exposure is made for ordinary prints by the exposure means 
including a light source, a lens and a shutter. The data 

of images on the film is read by an optical reader and 
converted into digital signals. Index prints are exposed 

by a PLZT print head controlled based on the digital 
signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for printing both ordinary and index prints
when printing on a photographic paper in accordance with the generic clauses of claims 1 and
4.Such a method and apparatus is already known from document US-A-5184227, which shows
an exposure means and a reading means for reading and scanning film data, and control
means for controlling the printing parameters, whereby an index print generator generates
signals in order to print an index print with the help of printer or with a hard copy output printer.
In this document, the projection exposure and the digital exposure on the photosensitive
material are carried out in a single common printing stage, i.e., printing stage.On a conventional image printer used to print on a
photosensitive material, the material is fed from a supply
magazine into a printer body to which a developed film,
too, is fed. The developed film is then exposed by use of
a halogen lamp at a photograph exposure stage so that the
image on the developed film will be printed on the
photosensitive material. After the material has been
developed and fixed at the developing unit, it is cut into
each frame and taken out.With such an image printer, with a roll of film
having 12, 24 or 36 frames, it is a common practice to make
an index print simultaneously to check the printing data
and the image information about the whole roll of film of
each customer. A mask exclusively used for index print is
inserted in the photograph exposure stage and in the mask 
the developed film is brought into a close contact with the
photosensitive material. Thus, an index print is made by
contact exposure.With such a conventional image printer, the film had
to be set in the special mask every time an index print is 
to be made. This work is troublesome and results in poor
working efficiency. Since each frame image is contact-exposed
for index print, an index print of the same size as
an ordinary print cannot be obtained. Also, the index
print does not look good because the frame line of the
film, too, is exposed to the light. Both of the ordinary
print and the index print cannot be obtained automatically
and continuously.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
method and an apparatus for printing images in which good-looking
index prints can be automatically obtained without
the need of setting the film into the special mask.This object is met by the characterizing features of claim 1 and 4.In this method, when an index print is printed, the
electric

<CLAIMS>
A method of printing the film images of a roll of film (F), comprising the steps of:

printing image prints by projecting and exposing the film images of the film (F) onto a photosensitive material
(PC) while optically reading data of said film images and converting the data to digital

electric signals; and
printing at least one index print of the film images contained in the film based on said
digital electric signals,
characterized in that
said image prints are exposed in a first printing stage (A),
whereas said at least one index print is printed on said
photosensitive material in a second printing stage (B) spaced from said first printing stage (A) in the feed direction of

the photosensitive material,
wherein said at least one index print is printed on said photosensitive material (PC) with
a PLZT print head (21) while feeding said photosensitive material from said first to

said second printing stage.
A method for printing images as claimed in claim 1 wherein said electric signals are
corrected according to the number of image frames of the film and the size of the film images on

the film to change the print size of each film image on said index print.
A method for printing images as claimed in claim 2, wherein if different film image formats
are contained in said film, said electric signals are corrected to form different kinds of

index prints in accordance with said formats. 
An appartus (1) for printing the film images of a roll of film (F), comprising a projection exposure means (A) for printing image prints of said film images by projecting and
exposing the film images onto a photosensitive material (PC), optical reading

means (17) for scanning and reading data of said projected film images and converting the data into
digital electric signals, a control means (30) for controlling printing parameters based on

said electric signals, and a digital exposure means (B) for digitally exposing said data and printing at least one index print of the film images contained in the film
in response to command signals from said control

means (30),
characterized in that
said digital exposure means (B) is spaced from said projection exposure means (A) in
the feed direction of the photosensitive material (PC) so as to digitally expose said

data and print said at least one index print on said photosensitive material,
and in that said digital exposure means (B) comprises a PLZT printer head (21) extending
across the path of the photosensitive material (PC) and a light source (6) for supplying

light to the PLZT printer head.
An apparatus for printing images as claimed in claim 4, wherein said control means (30)
comprises a data converter means for converting the size of the film images according to

the number of image frames of the film and the size of the film images on the film.
