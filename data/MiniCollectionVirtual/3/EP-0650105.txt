<ABSTRACT>
A structure for mounting a rotary member (A# to U#) is
provided including employing a pair of opposed spaced sheet

members (101, 102). First and second supporting structures
(101a, 101b, 101c; 102a, 102b, 102c) are respectively formed

at opposed locations on the sheet members, the supporting
structures each being one of a projecting part (101b, 102b)

and a burring part (101a, 102a). The rotary member is formed
with one of an axial shaft or an axial bore on each side

thereof for engagement with and support by a corresponding
opposed pair of supporting structures. The support members

may be either projecting parts, or burring parts. An image
forming apparatus is also provided employing this improved

structure for mounting a rotary member. The support
structures are formed on frame portions of the image forming

apparatus (U1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a structure 
for mounting a gear, a roller, or another rotary member and more 
particularly to an image forming apparatus, such as a printer or 
a facsimile machine, which performs a process for forming an image 
on a sheet material and employs this improved structure for 
mounting a gear, a roller, or another rotary member. A typical example of an image forming apparatus based on 
the prior art is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open 
No. 222270-1989 (Heisei 1). The mounting structure for a gear in 
the motive power transmitting mechanism for this apparatus is shown 
in FIG. 15, and is a structure formed with a first supporting shaft 
502, which supports a gear 501, being fixed in a frame 503, or 
formed with a gear mounted on each of both the ends of a second 
supporting shaft 505 inserted into a shaft bearing 504. An additional example of a prior art mounting structure, 
as shown in FIG. 16, 17 and 18, including a structure for mounting 
a component part by an application of a burring shaping process, 
is found in the structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Application 
Laid Open No. 34531-1989 (Showa 64). This structure is formed by 
forming a burring part 511 on a metal plate 510, mounting a rotary 
member or a sliding member 512 on this burring part 511, as shown 
in Fig. 16, and then bending a top end 513 of burring part 511 as 
shown in Figs. 17 and 18, thereby preventing the rotary member or 
sliding member 513 from falling off. However, these structures 
have a number of significant limitations. The environment surrounding computers in the more recent 
years is marked by a progressive downsizing of the size of 
computers, compact notebook type computers rising to a position of 
far greater importance than ever before. Along with this tendency, 
the market for personal computers has been enlarged to such an 
extent that there are now more intensified demands for the 
appearance of more compact external peripheral equipment, such as  
 
printers and facsimile machines. These peripherals must be offered 
for sale at lower prices, and must be smaller for use with 
compact-sized computers. Together, these components must be 
capable of being arranged on an individual person's desk leaving 
free work space still available. The prior art mentioned above 
cannot respond to such demand. The structure for mounting a gear as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 222270-1989 (Heisei 1), 
described above, is formed of a large number
