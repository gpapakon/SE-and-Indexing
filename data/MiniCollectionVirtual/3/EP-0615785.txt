<ABSTRACT>
For the purpose of disposal, discarded plastic packaging straps are fed substantially in a radial direction to a cylindrical path of at least one rotating cutting knife and are cut into short pieces. They are severed obliquely over their broad side faces and fed to the cylindrical path of the cutting knife at a uniform rate. The packaging straps are cut up between a cutting edge of the cutting knife and a knife edge past which the cutting edge is moved at a small distance from it. The cutting edge and the knife edge are inclined with respect to each other. The packaging straps are drawn by motor into the path of the cutting knife. The drawing-in of the packaging straps is interrupted automatically if a foreign body is drawn in. Each packaging strap is inserted between two draw-in rollers, which can be pressed against each other and of which at least one is driven by motor. The drawing-in of the packaging straps is interrupted if a predetermined distance between the draw-in rollers is exceeded.

A method of cutting up used-up hooping bands of plastic material
which are fed substantially in a radial direction to a cylindrical path of

at least one rotating cutting blade (18) and cut into short pieces and

advanced between two draw-in rollers (30, 32) which are arranged in front of
the path of the cutting blade (18) and which can be pressed towards each

other and of which at least one is motor-driven, characterised in that the
draw-in of the hooping bands is interrupted when a predetermined spacing

between the draw-in rollers (30, 32) is exceeded.
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the hooping
bands are severed inclinedly relative to their longitudinal direction.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the
hooping bands are fed to the cylindrical path of the cutting blade (18) at a

uniform speed.
Apparatus for cutting up used-up hooping bands comprising at least
one cutting blade (18) which rotates on a cylindrical path and to which the

hooping bands are fed substantially in the radial direction between two
draw-in rollers (30, 32) which are arranged in front of the path of the

cutting blade (18) and which can be pressed against each other and of which
at least one is motor-driven, characterised in that there is provided a

safety device which automatically interrupts a further feed of hooping bands
to the cutting blade (18) and which is switched on when a predetermined

spacing between the draw-in rollers (30, 32) is exceeded.
Apparatus according to claim 4 characterised by at least one
stationary stator blade (17) which is arranged outside the path of the 

rotating cutting blade (18) and which has a blade edge (15) arranged at a
small radial spacing from the cutting edge (20) of the cutting blade (18).
Apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in that the blade edge
(15) and the cutting edge (20) are inclined relative to each other.
Apparatus according to claim 6 characterised in that the angle of
inclination between the cutting edge (20) and the blade edge (15) is between

1 and 10 degrees, preferably about 5 degrees.
Apparatus according to one of claims 6 and 7 characterised in that
the angle of inclination is adjustable.
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 8 characterised by a
gripping-prevention protection means (72) disposed between a collecting

container (12) and the path of the cutting blade (18).
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 9 characterised in that
one of the draw-in rollers (30) can be automatically arrested in its

position when a predetermined spacing is exceeded.
Apparatus according to claim 10 characterised in that the
arresting means is manually releasable.
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 11 characterised in that
motor-driven draw-in of the hooping bands can be interrupted by applying a

pushing or pulling force to an introduction hopper (34).
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 12 characterised by an
introduction hopper (34) for the hooping bands, the hopper being mounted

pivotably or displaceably together with a draw-in roller (30). 
Apparatus according to claim 12 or claim 13 characterised in that
the spacing between two draw-in rollers (30, 32) is increased when a pulling

force is applied to the introduction hopper (34).
