<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pressure regulator (30) and in-tank mounting (28) for use in 
a non-return type fuel injection system of an automotive vehicle. The 

regulator housing is divided by a diaphragm (54) into an inlet chamber 
(56) and an outlet chamber (58). A spring (82) in the outlet chamber 

biases the diaphragm toward closing a through-passage (66) in the center 
of the diaphragm. The pressurized fuel supply is communicated to the 

inlet chamber (56) to open this through-passage (66) to an extent that 
allows the proper amount of excess fuel to pass through the outlet 

chamber from an outlet (86) of which the excess fuel spills into the tank 
(12), thereby regulating the pressure of the fuel supply. Several 

embodiments of pressure regulator are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel pressure regulators that are used in 
fuel injection systems of internal combustion engines that power 
automotive vehicles. From prior patents, including commonly assigned 
US-A-4 928 729, US-A-4 991 556, US-A-5 002 030, and 
US-A-5 076 320, it is known to mount a fuel pressure regulator on a fuel 
rail assembly for the purpose of regulating the pressure of the fuel that is 
supplied to fuel injectors mounted on the fuel rail. The pressurized fuel 
that is delivered to the fuel rail is pumped from a fuel tank through a fuel 
supply conduit, and excess fuel is returned from the fuel pressure 
regulator's return port through a fuel return conduit to the tank. This type 
of system is sometimes called a return type system. A typical fuel 
pressure regulator used in such a system comprises a housing having a 
moveable wall that divides the housing into a fuel chamber and a control, 
or reference, chamber. The reference chamber's interior is referenced to 
engine intake manifold vacuum so that the regulated pressure across the 
fuel injectors is essentially insensitive to changes in manifold vacuum. Another type of fuel injection system does not have a fuel return 
conduit and is sometimes called a non-return, returnless, or dead-headed 
system: In such a system, the fuel pressure is regulated at the tank, with 
the fuel pressure regulator being part of a pump module that is assembled 
into the tank and contains, inter alia, a fuel pump. If a fuel pressure 
regulator like the one in the above-described return system were to be 
used in a non-return system, a vacuum conduit from the engine intake  
 
manifold would have to be connected to its reference chamber if vacuum 
compensation were to be retained in the same way, and the fuel pressure 
regulator would simply spill excess fuel into the tank through its return 
port. On the other hand, if the reference chamber were exposed to the 
headspace of the tank, either intake manifold vacuum compensation 
would not be used or else it would have to be provided in some other 
way. Japanese Kokai JP-A-59170466 discloses a non-return fuel 
regulation system in which a fuel regulator is arranged with inlet and 
outlet chambers separated by a moveable wall means. A valve closure 
arrangement is disposed within the inlet chamber which co-operates with 
a through-passage formed in the moveable wall means to regulate the 
pressure of fuel supplied from a fuel tank to fuel injectors. The valve 
closure arrangement includes a swivel mounted

<CLAIMS>
A fuel regulator (30) for regulating fuel pressure within a fuel 
conduit (20) which connects a fuel tank (12) with a fuel injection system 

(22), the fuel regulator (30) comprising:- 

an inlet chamber (56) connected to receive fuel from said fuel 
conduit (20); 
an outlet chamber (58) connected to said fuel tank (12); 
moveable wall means (54) separating the inlet chamber (56) from 
the outlet chamber (58), said moveable wall means (54) being arranged 

to deformably distort in accordance with pressure differences between 
the inlet chamber (56) and the outlet chamber (58); 
an annular member (60) mounted on a central region of the said 
moveable wall means (54), said annular member (60) having a central 

through hole (66) formed therein for providing fluid communication 
between the inlet chamber (56) and the outlet chamber (58) when said 

moveable wall means is distorted, said annular member (60) including a 
valve seat portion (68) circumscribing said central through hole (66); 
resilient bias spring means (82) disposed in said outlet chamber 
(58) for biasing said annular member (60) towards said inlet chamber 

(56); and 
valve means (70, 72, 74, 76) located in said inlet chamber (56) 
including a swivel mounted closure member (70) which co-operates with 

said valve seat portion (68) to open and seal said central through hole 
(66); 
 
   characterized in that said swivel mounted valve closure member 

(70) comprises a truncated sphere which is disposed within a socket  
 

provided on a post (74) within said inlet chamber (56), said valve closure 
member (70) having a substantially flat face (72) which co-operates with 

said valve seat portion (68) to selectively restrict fuel flow through said 
central through hole (66) independently of angular variations in said 

annular member (60) resulting from distortions of said moveable wall 
means (54);
 
   and in that said socket has a rim (80) which is turned slightly 

inwardly after said truncated sphere (70) has been received therein so as 
to retain said sphere (70) in said orifice whilst permitting swivelling. 
A fuel regulator (30) as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said valve 
means (70, 72, 74, 76) further comprises a second resilient spring means 

(76) disposed within a cavity below said socket and is arranged to bias 
said truncated sphere (70) towards said rim (80) thereof. 
A fuel regulator (30) as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein said rim 
(80) engages said truncated sphere (70) above an equator thereof. 
A fuel system comprising a fuel regulator as claimed in any 
preceding Claim.
