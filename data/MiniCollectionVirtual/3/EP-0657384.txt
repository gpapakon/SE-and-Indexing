<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for efficiently 
producing hydrogen cyanide at a reaction temperature of 

preferably 250 to 550°C by a catalytic dehydrative 
reaction of formamide which comprises employing as a 

catalyst, a manganese oxide (MnO) and/or a magnesium oxide 
(MgO) each modified with an alkali metal (Na, K, Rb, Cs, 

etc.). The above process is capable of producing hydrogen 
cyanide at an enhanced conversion efficiency of formamide 

and at a high selectivity while minimizing the by-production 
of ammonia. The use of the catalyst comprising 

as a principal component, MnO modified with an alkali 
metal is particularly effective in prolonging its service 

life and enables a long-term stable operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing hydrogen cyanide by using formamide as a
starting raw material.Hydrogen cyanide is an indispensable basal chemical
to be used as various starting raw materials for organic
synthesis of mainly methacrylic ester, lactic acid and the
like and also to be used in mining and metallurgical
industries. In addition, it has recently expanded the
demand as the starting raw materials for the synthesis of
pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals and the like.As a process for industrially producing hydrogen
cyanide, there are spread the thermal cracking of
formamide, the oxidation of methane along with ammonia and
a like process. Hydrogen cyanide is also mass-produced as
the byproduct in the process for producing acrylonitrile
by the oxidation of propylene along with ammonia.The production of hydrogen cyanide by the thermal
cracking of formamide is represented by the reaction
equation (1) in which hydrogen cyanide and water each in
one (1) mol are produced from one (1) mol of formamide,
HCONH2 → HCN + H2O
which reaction is accompanied by the reaction equation (2) 
in which the formamide is decomposed into ammonia and
carbon monoxide.
HCONH2 → NH3 + COIn order to efficiently produce hydrogen cyanide
from formamide, it is indispensable to rapidly force the
reaction as represented by the equation (1) and at the
same time to suppress the reaction represented by the
equation (2) as much as possible. Accordingly, attempts
have heretofore been made to research and develop a
catalyst enhanced in activity and selectivity for the
reaction represented by the equation (1).There are described, for example, in USP No.
2,086,507 that a fused manganese oxide is effective as a
catalyst in the production of hydrogen cyanide from
formamide and in USP No. 2,534,000, a process for
producing hydrogen cyanide in high selectivity by using a
manganese oxide as a catalyst and by efficiently
evaporating formamide under vacuum.However, these catalysts that have heretofore been
employed involve the problem that in spite of their high
activity the selectivity to the objective hydrogen cyanide
is not so high and ammonia is by-produced in an amount of
about 10%.The by-production of ammonia not only lowers the
yield of the objective hydrogen cyanide but also functions
to accelerate the polymerization of hydrogen cyanide in
the form of liquid. Thus, in the case of isolating the 
produced hydrogen cyanide, the by-produced ammonia must be
removed by washing in advance, the reaction gas with
sulfuric
