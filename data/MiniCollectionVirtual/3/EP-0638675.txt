<ABSTRACT>
A draw-texturing apparatus comprises a heating device 
(3) for heating a running yarn (Y) and a false twisting 

device (5) disposed downstream of the heating device (3) for 
imparting twists to the yarn (Y). The apparatus further 

comprises a twist stopping device (11), disposed in the 
heating device (3), for stopping the run back of the twists 

imparted by the false twisting device (5). In the 
apparatus, drawing point of the yarn (Y) is not adversely 

affected by false twisting torque or vibration of the yarn 
(Y), and a textured yarn being free from unevenness in 

dyeability and having a high quality can be obtained by the 
apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a draw-texturing
apparatus of a synthetic yarn made of such as polyester or
polyamide. The present invention especially relates to a
draw-texturing apparatus of a partially oriented yarn (POY)
or an undrawn yarn (UD yarn) of such a synthetic yarn at a
high speed more than 400m/min.In a conventional draw-texturing apparatus, a false
twisting device is disposed downstream of a heating device,
a twist stopping device for stopping run back of the twists
imparted by the false twisting device towards the upstream
of the heating device is disposed near an entrance of the
heating device, and a bearing of the twist stopping device
is a ball-and-roller bearing. The running yarn is wrapped
around the twist stopping device so as to rotate the twist
stopping device.In another conventional draw-texturing apparatus, as
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-open
No. Sho 59-73378, a single heating device is disposed at a
draw-texturing region, and a twist stopping guide is
disposed upstream of the heating device, i.e., at the
entrance of the heating device. Thus, a yarn is drawn and
false twisted while it is partially in contact with the yarn
regulating guide disposed in a single heating device in a
draw-texturing region.Recently, the yarn texturing speed becomes high, while
the thickness of the yarn to be textured becomes small.As a result, when the twist stopping device is disposed
near the entrance of the heating device, the viscosity
resistance of the lubricant in the bearing of the twist
stopping device or rolling friction of the rolling bearing
is rapidly raised as the texturing speed is raised. Thus,
there occur such problems as described below. For an example, referring to Fig. 11, when a polyester
yarn, the thickness of which is 15 denier, is drawn and
false twisted, the tension in the yarn located upstream of
the twist stopping device (which is illustrated at the left
portion in Fig. 11) becomes excessively small, since the
rolling resistance of the twist stopping device is large
compared with tension in the texturing yarn (e.g., the
rolling resistance is about 4 to 5 g for a roller having a
diameter of 30mm). Thus, the yarn passage is fluctuated at
a position upstream of the twist stopping device or the yarn
entangles around a feed roller disposed upstream of the
twist stopping device, and operational conditions become
unstable.If the tension in the texturing yarn is raised in order
to prevent the yarn from the above-described entangling, the
tension in the yarn
