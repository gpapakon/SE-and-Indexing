<ABSTRACT>
A coordinate input device is provided to contribute to 
improvements in the mechanical mouse, opto-mechanical mouse or 

the like which are used to control cursor movements in the visual 
display unit of the computer system. The device comprises a 

position sensor (1) and a pressure sensor (3). The position 
sensor detects a two-dimensional position of the device, which is 

moved on a flat surface or the like by a person, so as to produce 
two-dimensional coordinates. The pressure sensor detects 

pressing force applied to the device by the person. Hence, the 
two-dimensional coordinates and the pressing force detected are 

used as parameters which control a cursor or a graphic image 
displayed on the screen of the visual display unit. The pressure 

sensor comprises an air-pressure sensor which detects a change of 
an air pressure caused by the pressing force applied to the 

device. In addition, the pressure sensor can be replaced by a 
grip sensor (4) which detects grip force applied to the device by 

the person.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coordinate input device,
and more particularly to a mouse whose movements on a flat
surface are reflected by cursor movements on a visual display
unit of a computer system.Conventionally, the coordinate input device such as the
mouse is widely used for the computer system in the business use
for the office work, engineering or the like, as well as in the
personal use for playing the video game, drawing the picture or
making the document containing tables. This device is useful in
inputting two-dimensional coordinates, which designate a location
to input a character on the screen or a location to start drawing
a picture on the screen. Normally, the cursor displayed on the
screen of the visual display unit is controlled in location or
coordinates by that device.FIG. 2A is a sectional view showing a mechanical structure
of the coordinate input device conventionally known. This is a
so-called mechanical mouse in which a rubber-coated ball 22 is
rolling on a flat surface 31 so that the amounts of movements in
X and Y directions are detected. Those movements are reflected
by the two-dimensional movements of the cursor on the screen.
This type of mouse is frequently used in the personal computer
system.In this device, a substrate 21 is fixedly located inside of
a main body 20. Due to the provision of the main body 20, the
substrate 21 and a ball-positioning member 24, the ball 22 is
located at a certain position such that the ball 22 can rotate in 
any directions. The rotation of the ball 22 is converted into
the location of the device on the flat surface 31.FIG. 2B shows a construction of a rotation detector 26.
Herein, a slit disk 34 is attached to an axis 32 such that the
slit disk 34 can rotate about the axis 32. A plurality of slits
are formed in the peripheral portion of the slit disk 34 at equal
intervals. A light-emitting element 36 is placed against a
light-receiving element 38 with respect to the slit disk 34. The
detection for the rotation of the ball 22 is activated when the
operator moves the device in a certain direction on the flat
surface 31 so that the ball 22 is correspondingly rotated. An
edge portion of the slit disk 34 normally comes in contact with
the ball 22; hence, the slit disk 34 should be rotated about the
axis 32 by a certain amount of rotation in response to the
rotation of the ball 22. The light emitted from the light-emitting
element 36 passes through the slit to reach the light-receiving
element 38. Since the slit disk 34 rotates responsive
