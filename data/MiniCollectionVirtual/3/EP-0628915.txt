<ABSTRACT>
A two-line multi-station bus system has a clock wire and a data wire and 
supports selective slave station addressing by a prevalent master station for thereupon 

eliciting a bitwise clocked data transfer between said clocking master station and an 
addressed and clocked slave station. Moreover, the system supports analog signal 

transfer in that said prevalent master station has holding means for while eliciting the 
ana
log signal from said actual addressed slave station holding said clocking through 
carrying said clock wire at a predetermined binary value. The analog signal is received 

until changeover of the clock wire to the other binary value. in a particular version the 
analog signal is pulse width modulated in combination with associate delimiting signals 

on the clock wire sent by the transmitter station that is not necessarily the master 
station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a two-line bus system as set forth in the preamble of Claim 1. Such a
system has been described in an article titled "I2C bus in consumer applications" by
A.Moelands and published in "Electronic components and applications", Vol 5, No.4,
September 1983, Eindhoven NL pages 214-221. The I2C system is also described in
European patent application EP 051332 and corresponding US patent US 4,689,740.
These references describe the so-called I2C system. The I2C system contains a bus with a
clock wire and a data wire, to which a number of stations may be connected. One or more
stations may be master stations that can become prevalent master station, if necessary by
winning arbitration on the bus. Thereupon, the master station and a slave station
communicate clocked binary data via the bus. The I2C bus has been designed predominantly
for communicating control signals between integrated circuit chips that are located
within a single apparatus such as may be intended for, but not limited to consumer
entertainment. I2C has gained status as de facto standard.The present invention intends to extend the field of use of bus systems
that are of comparable structure as, but not necessarily identical to the I2C bus, in
particular to such applications where both digital and analog signals occur. One field of
application is where a slave station may emit a bit stream that in principle may have an
infinite length. A particular example of an analog signal is one wherein a slave station
is a smart sensor that when addressed emits a sense signal with an analog amplitude or
shape. Analog in this context means multivalued to such extent as the receiver can
discriminate, such discrimination being generally equal to the discrimination assigned to
a signal by a transmitter, although the granularity applied by the receiver may be
coarser.Accordingly, amongst other things it is an object of the present invention
to provide a bus system according to the preamble, wherein simple analog signal
generators can be accessed in a straightforward manner without the need for providing
each such slave station with an analog-to-digital converter that would represent an
unbearable financial overhead. Now, according to one of its aspects, the invention is characterized in that
said system supports analog signal transfer in that said prevalent master station has
holding means for while eliciting said analog signal from said actual addressed slave
station holding said clocking through carrying said clock wire at a
