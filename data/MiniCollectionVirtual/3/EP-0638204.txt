<DESCRIPTION>
 BASE RESISTANCE CONTROLLED MOS GATED THYRISTOR WITH IMPROVED TURN-OFF CHARACTERISTICSThe present invention relates generally to the field of four-layer, latching semiconductor devices, and particularly to methods for controlling the conduction characteristics of such devices by modulating the voltage applied to the gate electrode of a MOSFET portion of the device.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe development of power MOSFET's was at least in part motivated by the objective of reducing the control current required by power bipolar devices during forced turn-off. In bipolar devices the injection of minority carriers into their drift region reduces the resistance to forward current flow. These devices are capable of operation at appreciable current densities, but are relatively inefficient as a consequence of the large currents required during device turn-on and turn-off.In contrast, the gate structure of the power MOSFET has a very high steady-state impedance. This allows control of the device by a voltage source, since only relatively small gate drive currents are required to charge and discharge the input gate capacitance. Unfortunately, the ease of gating the power MOSFET is offset by its high on-state resistance arising from the absence of minority carrier injection. Hence, a combination of low-resistance bipolar-type current conduction with MOS gate control would provide the desired features of high operating forward current density and low gate drive power. 

Referring to the cross-sectional illustration of Fig. 1, a device known as an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) illustrates one approach to combining these features. In this type of structure most of the forward current flow occurs between the emitter and collector terminals of the vertical PNP bipolar transistor portion of the device. The on-state losses of the IGBT at high voltages are significantly less than those of power MOSFETs due to the injection of minority carriers (electrons) into the N-base drift region.As shown in Fig. 2, a regenerative device known as MOS-controIled thyristor (MCT) exhibits less forward voltage drop than does the IGBT. This P-N-P-N structure can be regarded as two transistors - an upper NPN transistor and a lower PNP transistor - that are internally connected in such a fashion as to obtain regenerative feedback between each other. Specifically, a thyristor may be considered as a combination of PNP and NPN bipolar transistors connected such that the base of each is driven by the collector current of the other.
