<ABSTRACT>
A video distribution management system utilizes a shared 
video library and a wide area network to deliver video 

files to local caches on the local area networks serving a 
subset of local viewing stations. A combination of direct 

local cache access, scheduled future local cache access 
and speed match distribution of video files makes the 

overall system both efficient and economical. In particular, 
a locally stored preface of a video file can be immediately 

viewed on the local area network while the balance 
of the video file is transmitted from the remote video 

library.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multimedia file distribution and, more particularly,
to the use of existing wide area and local area networks for the distribution
of multimedia files from a centralized reposi tory for such files.Multimedia distribution systems have remained local area network systems
(LANs) due to the lack of an avail able distributed multimedia infrastructure. In
existing wide area networks (WANs), the available bandwidth is insufficient to
support remote playback of video files, particularly in view of network-related
problems such as network latency, jitter and limited throughput. As a result, a
typical solution is to maintain large libraries of video files in a large number of
geo graphically dispersed locations in order to provide reasonably rapid access
for widely disbursed users. The cost of creation and maintenance of such multiple
video libraries, along with the local distribution facilities, is often prohibitive
for most users. In addition to the prohibitive cost, the difficulty in
scheduling viewing and managing the local distribution of such videos makes video
distribution systems rare and inefficient.International Patent Application WO-A-91 03112 (De Bey et al.) entitled "PROGRAM
TRANSMISSION OPTIMISATION" discloses a system and method of optimising
transmission of a program to multiple users over a distribution system, with particular
application to video-on-demand for a CATV network. The system includes, at a 
head end of the CATV network a scheduling and routing computer for dividing the
video program stored in long term fast storage or short term fast storage into a
plurality of program segments, and a subscriber distribution node for transmitting
the program segments in a redundant sequence in accordance with a scheduling
algorithm. At a receiver of the CATV network there is provided a buffer memory for
storing the transmitted video program segments for subsequent playback whereby,
in use, the scheduling algorithm can ensure that a user's receiver will receive all of
the program segments in a manner that will enable continuous playback in real time
of the program. Under the control of controller the receiver distinguishes received
program segments by a segment identifier so that redundant segments captured in
capture memory are then stored in buffer memory from which the segments can be
retrieved and decompressed data decompressor for immediate or subsequent
viewing.Publication entitled "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR A LARGE SCALE VIDEO ON

<CLAIMS>
A method of distributing video files in a video distribution
system comprising the steps of :


storing a plurality of video files in a shared video file
library,
transmitting video files from a video file cache in a local
network to a plurality of viewing stations at a real time

playback rate of said video files for viewing at said stations
concurrently with the transmissions,
connecting a wide area network to the shared video library to
transmit video files stored at the shared library to the local

network at a rate lower than the real time playback rate of said
video files,
determining if the cache contains a requested file responsive to
a request from a viewing station to view the video file,
activating the transmission of the requested file from the
shared video library to the cache via the wide area network

responsive to the request from the requesting station in the
event the cache does not contain the requested file, and
activating the transmission of the requested video file in the
cache to the viewing station at a real time video viewing rate.
The method according to claim 1 further comprising the step
of : 


dividing at least one of said video files into two parts, a
first part or preface for transmission on said local network at

the real time playback rate, and a second part for transmission
on said wide area network over the duration of the playback of

the entire said video file, and
continuing the transmission of the second part to the requesting
station on the local network at the completion of the first part

so as to provide uninterrupted play of the requested file at the
requesting station.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims
further comprising the step of :


monitoring use statistics of each of said video files, and
transferring video file prefaces from said library to said local
cache in response to said use statistics.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims
further comprising the step of :


monitoring use statistics of each of said video file, and
transferring entire video files from said library to said local
cache in response to said use statistics.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims
further comprising the step of : 


providing complete access to video files or video file prefaces
in said local cache by any one of said viewing stations on

demand.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims
further comprising the step of :


scheduling delivery of a video file from said shared library to
said local cache prior to a requested viewing time for that

video file.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims
further comprising the step of :


in response to a request from a station containing a time of
playback of a requested file and to a determination that the

requested file is not in the cache, determining if the file can
be transmitted on the wide area network to the cache by the

requested playback time, and
denying the request if the requested file cannot be transmitted
to the cache.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims
further comprising the step of :


determining if the cache contains a preface of the requested
file, wherein a preface is an initial portion of a video file

sufficient to play at a real time viewing rate such that the
remainder of the file can be obtained at the lower transmission

rate of the wide area network by the time play of the preface is
completed, and 
obtaining the portion of the requested file not in the cache
from the shared library concurrently with the transmission of

the preface to the requesting station from the cache.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims
further comprising the step of :


continuing the transmission of the remaining portion of the file
obtained from the shared library to the requesting station at

the completion of transmission of the preface so as to provide
uninterrupted playing of the requested file at the requesting

station.
A video file distribution system for carrying out the method
according to anyone of the preceding claims.
