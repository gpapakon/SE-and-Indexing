<ABSTRACT>
Process and agent for the treatment of untanned skins, in particular pelts, with a view to ensuring a protection of the latter avoiding or reducing the degradation or the loss of their quality. This process consists in placing the substances in contact with an aqueous bath containing, in combination, an electrolyte, silicon oxide and at least one amide-amine, the pH of the bath being adjusted to a value of between 1.5 and 5, in particular between 3.7 and 4.3. The process of the invention provides a reversible treatment allowing the collagen-based substances to be subsequently returned to their initial state by a reverse treatment consisting in raising the pH to a value of at least 5.3.
