<ABSTRACT>
Chromogenic reagents, and more particularly compounds which function as selective cation-sensitive dyes are disclosed. The compounds are of formula (II) wherein X is a chromophore; Y and Z are -CH2(CHR-O-CHR)nCH2- in which n is an integer from 1 - 10 (which may be different for Y and Z) and each R independently is hydrogen or a substituent for hydrogen or when n is an integer from 2-10 at least one -CHR-CHR- group may additionally represent a substituted or unsubstituted arylene group; W indicates one or more optional substituents on the benzene ring; and A is a group imparting acidity to the molecule. Preferred compounds are those in which n = 2 for Z and n = 1 or 2 for Y; X is 4-nitrophenylazophenol and R is hydrogen or additionally when n is 2 at least one -CHR-CHR- group may represent a substituted or unsubstituted arylene group.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONCHROMOGENIC REAGENTSThe present invention relates to chromogenic reagents and more particularly to compounds which function as selective cation-sensitive dyes (referred to hereafter as chromoionophores) . These chro oionophores are based upon chromophores which are linked to cation-selective ionophores.Chromoionophores based upon chromophores which are linked to cation-selective ionophores are described in the publications listed below:-J.F.Alder, D.C.Ashworth, R. Narayanaswamy, R.E.Moss and I.O.Sutherland, Analyst, 1987, 112. 1191; I.P.Danks and I.O.Sutherland, J.Inclusion Phenomena and Mol. Recognition in Chemistry, 1992, 12, 223; A.M.King, C.P.Moore, K.R.A.S.Sandanayake, and I.O.Sutherland, J.Che . Soc, Chem. Commun., 1992, 582.In the first of these papers an optical fibre probe is reported to respond to potassium ions in aqueous solution with a K+/Na selectivity ratio of 6.4 and in the other two papers new chromoionophores are described which show much greater K+/Na+ selectivity.A series of modified cryptands has also been prepared as reagents for detecting potassium. These 

compounds are described in a patent and a recent publication which are, respectively;- R.Klink, D.Bodar, J.M.Lehn, B.Helfert, and R.Bitsch, DE-A- 3,202,779 filed on 4 August 1983 in the name of Merck GmbH (Chem.Abs., 1984, lp). 34574p) and E.Chapoteau, B.P.Czech, C.R.Gebauer, A.Kumar, K.Leong, D.T.Mytych, .Zazulak, D.H.Desai, E.Luboch, J.Krzykawski and R.A.Bartsch, J.Org. Chem. , 1991, 56, 2575.They have the general formula:
 wherein R is 

 3-phenyl-5-isothiazolylazo, 5-isothiazolylazo, 5-thiazolylazo, 2,4,6-(Î¸2N)3- 

 4-0x0-2,5-cyclohexen-l-ylidenamino, or (p- Me2NC6H4)2COH; m and n are 0 or 1; andX is N or COH.All of the documents above however relate to chromoionophores which are, to varying degrees. 

selective for potassium ions. These chromoionophores show relatively poor selectivity for other cations of physiological importance, such as sodium, magnesium and calcium. There is also poor selectivity for lithium, which has been widely used in the treatment of mental illness for about 40 years. Since the blood-serum concentration of lithium is important in such treatments, it is important to be able to measure this concentration accurately. However, to date the best Li+/Na+ selectivity that has been reported(D.Parker and co-workers, J.Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans.2, 1990, 321) is about 1500 which is still significantly short of the value of about 30000 required for the measurement of serum concentrations of
