<ABSTRACT>
A shaft support member of at least one (12) of a pair of kneading rolls (11, 12) opposing each other with a 
very small gap between them and forming a valley portion, in which a resin charged from above stays, is connected to 

a driving source which changes a shaft gap, and a pair of weir plates (15b) having a shape substantially in conformity 
with the shape of the valley portion and adjacent to the kneading rolls (11, 12) without coming into contact with them 

are connected to a moving driving source in the axial direction of the kneading rolls (11, 12) while being spaced apart 
by a substantial effective width of the kneading rolls (11, 12). A sheet frame supply source supplies sheet frames (40) 

one by one toward the valley portion. Conveyor means (57, 58) for an inspection sheet is disposed at a discharge 
position of the inspection sheet, which is formed by bonding a resin sheet (37) kneaded and formed by a pair of 

kneading rolls (11, 12) and bonded to the sheet frame (40), and a table (59) for the inspection sheet and an imaging 
apparatus including a light source (64) and a video camera (65) are successively disposed downstream of the conveyor 

means (57, 58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic inspection 
apparatus for fisheyes in such thermoplastic resins as a 
vinyl chloride resin to an apparatus which automatically 
manufactures the resin sheets to be specimens for such 
inspection and to the process for automatic manufacture of 
the resin sheets to be specimens for the same inspection. Ideally any synthetic resins should allow no mingling of any 
foreign matters nor any such heterogenous mixtures as 
non-gelated particles. However fabrication of any synthetic 
resins perfectly homogeneous is a task of extreme difficulty. 
In most cases therefore trying in vain to manufacture such 
perfect products would be to seek after over-quality, which 
will lead normally to higher cost. In this line of thinking 
most of synthetic resin manufacturers are inspecting quantitatively 
foreign matters and non-gelated particles in the 
resins to furnish the secondary transformation with the 
synthetic resins whose quality could be improved therethrough  
 
into that corresponding to the quality of the final products 
required. The control of non-gelated particles and other foreign 
matters in synthetic resins, called "fisheye" inspection, has 
been achieved visually and optically. More in concrete, the 
synthetic resins in powdered form are spread homogeneously 
and observed visually (by naked eyes) to detect any heterogeneous 
or non-gelated particles or else photographed and 
measured by means of a video camera. Sometimes the synthetic 
resins are formed into sheets to measure any foreign matters 
and fisheyes. Depending upon more or less fisheyes the 
synthetic resins corresponding to the production lot are 
provided to some appropriate uses. Conventionally the resins sheets applied to the foregoing 
examination have been manufactured by roll mill, a kneading 
machine. Provided in the roll mill is a pair of heating type 
kneading rolls the distance between which can be adjusted. 
The two kneading rolls are heated beforehand to a prescribed 
temperature in terms of the melting point of the resin to be 
processed, and the gap therebetween is regulated in match 
with the thickness of the resin sheet to be formed. One of 
the kneading rolls will be rotated at a high speed, while the 
other, at a low speed. When the compound for synthetic resin 
is put into the valley-formed portion between the two rolls,  
 
it melts down by the heat radiated from the respective rolls 
and goes to be kneaded by being crashed or sheared therebetween. 
The synthetic resin will then
