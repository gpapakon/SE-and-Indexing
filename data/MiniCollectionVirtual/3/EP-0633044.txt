<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing device disposed in a slot machine island (100) for dispensing medals to a plurality of positions in the island. 
This dispensing device is disposed along the arrangement of the slot machines, and comprises a conveying line (130) for conveying 

the medals in a direction of the arrangement of the slot machines and a dispensing mechanism (200) for taking out the medals 
conveyed by said conveying line from said conveying line. Said dispensing mechanism (200) is provided on the side surface of the 

conveying line and includes: a frame (4) having a plurality of discharge openings through which the medals conveyed by the conveying 
line are taken out sideways; a guiding mechanism (3) secured to the frame for introducing the medals on the line to the 

outside through said discharge openings; and a delivery path (9) for guiding the medals discharged through the discharge openings 
to the intended position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medal distribution system in a 
slot machine island for distributing medals transported on a 
supplying belt conveyor to slot machines and medal lending 
machines. Slot machines are grouped and each group of slot machines 
is placed like an island in a gaming house. The group of slot 
machines thus arranged is called a slot machine island. In 
addition to the slot machines, a plurality of medal lending 
machines for lending medals are located in the slot machine 
island. The medal lending machines are placed between the slot 
machines in the slot machine island and/or at least on one end of 
a row of slot machines. The slot machine island is provided with a medal 
distribution system for distributing medals to the slot machines 
and the medal lending machines. A conventional medal distribution system in a slot machine 
island is described in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No.Sho 61-16186, 
for example. The medal distribution system has a  
 
supplying belt conveyor disposed in the upper portion of the slot 
machine island, a plurality of distributors located along the course 
of the belt conveyor, and supply passages each disposed between 
each distributor and its corresponding slot machine or medal 
lending machine. The system transports medals in the horizontal 
direction via the supplying belt conveyor and distributes the 
medals by means of the distributors so as to supply the medals to 
the slot machines and the medal lending machines via the 
separate supply passages. Whenever medal distribution becomes necessary, the medal 
distribution system selects and operates a corresponding one of 
the distributors, each of which is installed for each slot machine or 
medal lending machine, in response to the necessity arising for the 
medal distribution, thereby dropping the medals into the supply 
passage connected to the slot machine or medal lending machine 
requiring medal, for distribution. However, the conventional distribution system is equipped 
with only as many distributors as the number of slot machines 
and medal lending machines to which the medals are to be 
distributed. The distributors are fixed to their respective 
installation places. Therefore, the connection positions of the supply passages 
are uniquely determined; in such a distribution system, the 
locations of supply passages (disposition route) are extremely 
limited. As a result, it is difficult to avoid interference with other 
devices in the slot machine island when disposing the supply  
 
passages.

<CLAIMS>
A medal distribution system placed in a slot machine 
island where a plurality of slot machines are arranged in a row for 

distributing medals to a plurality of sections in the island, said 
medal distribution system comprising: 

   a conveyance line being disposed along the row of slot 
machines for transporting medals in a row direction of the slot 

machines; and 
   a distribution mechanism for extracting medals transported 

on said conveyance line from said conveyance line, 
   said distribution mechanism having: 

   a frame having a plurality of discharge openings being 
formed on a side face of said conveyance line for extracting 

medals transported on said conveyance line from said line to the 
side; 

   a plurality of guide mechanisms being attached to said frame for leading 
medals on said line to an outside through said discharge openings; 

and 
   a plurality of supply passages for guiding medals discharge
d through said 
discharge openings to target sections, 

   wherein said frame has a greater number of said discharge 
openings than the number that are actually used for distributing 

medals, along a transport direction of said conveyance line. 
The medal distribution system as claimed in claim 1 
wherein each of said guide mechanisms and said supply passages 

 
has a structure detachably linked to said discharge opening. 
The medal distribution system as claimed in claim 2 
wherein each of said guide mechanisms comprises: 

   a rotating shaft being mounted sideways at a position above 
said conveyance line and inside said discharge opening; 

   a guide plate being mounted on said rotating shaft for 
rotation, when a lower edge of said guide plate approaches a top 

face of said conveyance line, said guide plate abutting against a 
medal transported on said conveyance line for leading the medal 

into the discharge opening where said rotating shaft is disposed; 
and 

   an actuator for driving said rotating shaft.
