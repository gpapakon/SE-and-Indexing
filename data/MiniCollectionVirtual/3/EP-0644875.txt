<DESCRIPTION>
 ULTRA WHITE N,N■-ETHYLENE-BIS(TETRARROMOPHTHALIMIDE) AND ITS PRODUCTION IN ACETIC ACIDBACKGROUNDThe present invention relates generally to fire retardants for use in polymer compositions and the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to an ul ra-white N, '-ethylene-bis-( etrabromophthalimide) composition and to a method for its production.Fire retardant compositions are performance chemicals that must meet exacting standards to gain acceptance and widespread use in industry. Among requirements for flarne retardants, color is of particular importance. For a majority of applications, it is desired that the flame retardant be as white as possible. This enables production of high quality white plastics, but is also important because polymer processors require that colors of end products result from the particular pigment utilized rather than its combination with the color of the flame retardant.One material receiving substantial attention as a flame retardant is N,N'-ethylene-bis-(tetrabromophthalimide)(EBT). However, acceptance of EBT compositions in industry has severely lagged largely because EBT compositions thus far available have been too yellow. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a uniquely white EBT composition for use as a flame retardant. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing a uniquely white EBT composition.Another object of the invention is to provide a polymer composition and articles produced therefrom comprising the uniquely white EBT composition.These and other objects of the invention are achieved by preferred embodiments of the present invention, one of which provides a process for preparing a highly white N,N'-ethylene-bis(tetrabromophthalimide) product. This process comprises reacting ethylene diamine and tetrabromophthalic anhydride in acetic acid to produce N,N"-ethylene-bis(tetrabromophthalimide) . TheN,N'-ethylene-bis(tetrabromophthalimide) is then recovered in a white precipitate, which is dried, so as to form a N,N'-ethylene-bis(tetrabromophthalimide) product with a yellowness index of about 4 or less. In a particularly preferred mode, this process is achieved by the steps of slurrying tetrabromophthalic anhydride into acetic acid, adding ethylene diamine to the slurry at a temperature of at least about 80°C to form a reaction mixture, reacting the reaction mixture at a temperature of at least about 120°C to achieve at least 70% conversion toN,N'-ethylene-bis(tetrabromophthalimide) ,
