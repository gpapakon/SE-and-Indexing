<ABSTRACT>
Composite panels having high fire protection performance and comprising two outer layers and a core, with the core containing a core mixture and the core mixture containing aluminium hydroxide in compacted form, light fillers, if appropriate finely divided or splintery aluminium hydroxide, if desired magnesium hydroxide and binder based on polymers. The composite panels are suitable, for example, as facing panels for above-ground buildings.
