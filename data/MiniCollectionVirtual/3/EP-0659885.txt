<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a vaccine 
against a virus associated with antibody-dependent-enhancement 

of viral infectivity. Such a vaccine 
comprises a herpesvirus vector which is able to spread 

from cell-to-cell and which does produce non-infectious 
progeny virions having a gene encoding an 

antigen of said virus inserted into the herpesvirus 
genome.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates te a live virus 
vector which is able to spread from cell-to-cell and 
which does produce non-infectious progeny virions, to 
a cell culture comprising such a live virus vector and 
to vaccines based on this live virus vector. The majority of viral infections of animals and 
man are not fatal, but are followed by recovery and 
the development of a state of relative or absolute 
resistance against re-infection with the same virus. 
Much of this resistance can be attributed to specific 
antiviral antibodies, although cellular immune 
mechanisms also contribute to the protection of the 
host. Viruses are complex antigens, and as such can be 
expected to stimulate the production of antiviral 
antibodies against a variety of different antigenic 
determinants or epitopes. Not all antiviral antibodies 
are necessarily virus neutralizing antibodies 
(Porterfield J.S., Advances in Virus Research 31, 335-355, 
1986). However, in addition to these virus 
neutralizing antibodies or non-neutralizing antibodies 
a further group of antibodies exist: antibodies which 
enhance the infectivity of the virus. This phenomenon 
is known as antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) of  
 
viral infectivity and has been observed with various 
macrophage-infecting viruses. ADE of virus infection occurs when monocytes or 
macrophages are more efficiently infected by complexes 
of virus plus antibody than by virus alone. ADE of 
virus infection in vitro or in vivo has been reported 
for a wide range of viruses, such as various 
flaviviruses, including Dengue virus, West Nile virus, 
Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Yellow fever 
virus; alphaviruses such as tick-borne encephalitis 
virus, Semliki Forest virus, Western equine 
encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus; Lactate 
dehydrogenase virus (family Togaviruses); human 
respiratory syncytial virus; influenza A virus, rabies 
virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), 
human- and feline immunodeficiency virus (HIV, FIV) 
and murine cytomegalo virus (review of Porterfield 
1986, supra; Olsen, C.W., Veterinary Mircobiology 36, 
1-37, 1993). Of course for those viruses associated with ADE 
of viral infectivity for which alteration of the 
pathogenesis of the disease in vivo occurs, ADE has an 
important bearing on the development of vaccines for 
these viruses, because the pre-existence of enhancing 
antibodies due to the vaccination with viral antigens 
may accelerate infection and the onset of disease once 
the vaccinated host becomes infected
