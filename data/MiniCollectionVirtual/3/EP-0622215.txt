<ABSTRACT>
A platen (38) is located at a print position in a sheet path 
leading from a sheet supply position through the print position 

to a sheet delivery position, and a thermal head (40) having an edge 
portion at which a plurality of heating elements (39) are arranged 

in a line is held by a head holder (47), wherein the thermal head (40) is 
positioned so that the heating elements (47) are kept in contact 

with the platen (38) through the sheet path at the print position 
and that the heating elements are directed to a downstream side 

of the sheet path (32). With this arrangement, the heating elements (39) 
of the thermal head (40) can be located close to the sheet delivery 

position, so that just after a leading sheet after printed is 
delivered, the next sheet can be printed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a line thermal printer
for printing with use of a thermal head, and more particularly
to a line thermal printer using a thermal head having an edge
portion at which a line of heating elements is formed.There conventionally exists a line thermal printer for
forming a desired print on a sheet of paper by selectively
driving a plurality of heating elements arranged in a
horizontal scanning direction and feeding the sheet of paper in
a vertical scanning direction. An example of such a
conventional line thermal printer will now be described with
reference to Figs. 7 and 8.Figs. 7 and 8 show an exemplary line thermal printer to be
primarily used as a label printer. A plurality of labels 1 are
attached to an elongated base sheet 2 to form a label sheet 3
stored in a rolled condition. The roll of the label sheet 3 is
supported to a sheet support shaft 4. A sheet path 5 is
provided to guide the label sheet 3 drawn from the sheet
support shaft 4 along a given path. A printing section 6 is
provided in connection with the sheet path 5.The printing section 6 is composed of a platen 7 adapted 
to be rotationally driven by a driving member (not shown), a
line type of thermal head 9 having a plurality of heating
elements 8 arranged in a line, and a ribbon supply unit 14 for
guiding an ink ribbon 13 along a given ribbon path 12 leading
from a ribbon supply shaft 10 to a ribbon take-up shaft 11.
The thermal head 9 is opposed to the platen 7 with the sheet
path 5 interposed therebetween, and is supported pivotably
about a fulcrum 15 to thereby come into contact with or
separation from the platen 7. Further, the thermal head 9 is
normally biased to the platen 7 by a biasing member (not
shown). The ribbon path 12 passes a print position P where the
heating elements 8 of the thermal head 9 come to contact with
the platen 7, and the ribbon path 12 is bent at an edge portion
E of the thermal head 9.A label separating plate 16 for sequentially separating
the labels 1 from the base sheet 2 by sharply bending the base
sheet 2 is provided in the sheet path 5 at a position
downstream of the print position P. The base sheet 2 bent by
the label separating plate 16 is wound by a base sheet take-up
shaft (not shown), while the labels 1 separated from the base
sheet 2 are sequentially delivered from a label delivery
opening (not shown).In operation, the label sheet 3 guided in the sheet path 5
is fed by the rotation of the platen 7. During the course of
such feed of the label sheet 3, desired contents

<CLAIMS>
A line thermal printer for printing on a label sheet
(35) composed of an elongated based sheet (37) and a

plurality of labels (36) attached to said base sheet,
comprising:


a first sheet path (32) leading from a label sheet
supply position (30) through a print position (P) to a

label delivery position;
a label separating plate (34) located substantially
at the label delivery position, for sharply bending said

base sheet;
a platen (38) located at said print position (P) so
as to be kept in contact with said sheet path;
a thermal head (40) having an edge portion (E) at
which a plurality of heating elements (39) are arranged

in a line; and
a head holder (47) for holding said thermal head so
that in the operating position said heating elements are

kept in contact with said platen through said first sheet
path at said print position;

sheet path (33) extending straight in a given range from

a position upstream of said print position (P) to a
position downstream of said print position, and said

thermal head (40) being held by said head holder (47) 
so that in the operating condition said thermal head is

inclined at such an angle from the straight sheet path
so as not to interfere with said straight sheet path;
