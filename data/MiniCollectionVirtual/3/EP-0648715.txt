<ABSTRACT>
An automobile window glass has a transparent colored 
film coated as a shade band on a sheet of glass along a 

longitudinal edge thereof. The transparent colored film comprises 
a coated paste made of Au, Si, and at least one transition 

metal selected from the group consisting of V, Fe, Cu, 
Co, Cr, Mo, Mn, Bi, W, Rh, Pd, and Pt. The transparent colored 

film has a varying thickness in a transverse direction 
across the longitudinal edge of the sheet of glass. 
An apparatus for manufacturing an automobile window 
glass with a shade band, comprising a rubber roll 

with a flexible shaft and a bending blade creating a progressively varying 
gap betweeen the rubber roll and the glass to be coated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automobile
window glass comprising a sheet of glass coated with
transparent colored film as a shade band.Heretofore, it has been customary to apply a
transparent colored film to a sheet of glass according
to an Ag staining process, as disclosed in Japanese
laid-open patent publications Nos. 56-14454 and 57-95854,
for example.The conventional Ag staining process is, however,
disadvantageous because the transparent colored film
formed on the sheet of glass tends to suffer abrupt
color irregularities because Ag ions are diffused into a
surface layer of the glass to different degrees
depending on the temperature.Another problem of the transparent colored film
produced by the conventional Ag staining process is that
the film lacks sufficient practical durability as it may
peel off easily when rubbed lightly by paper due to poor
abrasion resistance and its low acid resistance allows
it to be dissolved by contact with a battery solution.DE-A-2841287 discloses application of a varying
thickness strip of colored material to a substrate, e.g.
glass; however it uses an electrostatic spraying method
and the color of the material is provided by a dyestuff
mixture.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an automobile window glass with a shade band which is
highly durable and aesthetically attractive, and an
apparatus for manufacturing such an automobile window
glass with a shade band.According to the present invention, there is 
provided an automobile window glass comprising a sheet
of glass, and a transparent colored film disposed as a
shade band on said sheet of glass, said transparent
colored film comprising a paste which has been fired
after application to said sheet of glass, said fired
paste including therein Au, Si and at least one
transition metal selected from the group consisting of
V, Fe, Cu, Co, Cr, Mo, Mn, Bi, W, Rh, Pd, and Pt, said
transparent colored film having a varying thickness
along a surface of said sheet of glass. Preferably, the coated paste is made of 5 parts of
pine oil, 10 parts of rosemary oil with fine powder of Au
dissolved therein, 0.1 part of urea resin, 1 part of vanadium
naphthenate, 2 parts of bismuth naphthenate, 2 parts of iron
acetylacetonate, 1 part of methanol silica sol, and 15 parts
of tetraisopropoxysilane.The sheet of glass may be elongate, and the transparent
colored film may be disposed along a longitudinal edge
of the sheet of glass and progressively smaller in thickness
in a transverse direction of the sheet of glass away
