This invention relates to novel electrically conductive
conjugated polymers such as polyaniline. Another aspect of
this invention relates to articles formed from conjugated
polymers such as polyaniline articles, including films, inks,

polymer compositions of this invention.There has recently been an increased interest in the
electrochemistry and electrical phenomena of polymeric
systems. Recently, work has intensified with polymers
having extended conjugation in at least one backbone chain
such as a polyaniline. See for example , EP-A-0017717;
