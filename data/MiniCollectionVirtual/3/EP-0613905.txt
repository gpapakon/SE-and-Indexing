A biodegradable moulded article based on natural vegetable or animal fibres, in particular a biodegradable plant pot, is characterised in that it contains  90 to 50% by weight of fibres and  1 to 50% by weight of a pretreated potato pulp, where the data in % by weight are based on dry matter, and the potato pulp is pretreated by the action of enzymes which influence the fibrous structure of the potato pulp, or the particles of the potato pulp have been reduced to a size of less than 350  mu m by a mechanical pretreatment.
