<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises an emitter diode (17) and a 
receiver phototransistor (18) which are arranged at the 

same face of a transparent plate (19) associated with the 
drum (11) of the weft feeder (10) and suitable to receive 

the turns of the weft reserve (RF). The emitter (17) 
directs onto the transparent plate (19) a beam of rays (R₁) 

which is tilted at a preset angle of incidence (α), and the 
receiver (18) receives a beam of rays (R₂) that emerge from 

the transparent plate (19) and form an angle of reflection 
(β), with respect to the plate, which is different from the 

angle of incidence (α) produced by multiple-reflection 
means (20) located at the other face of the transparent 

plate (19). The incident rays (R₁) and/or the emerging rays 
(R₂) are interrupted by a turn (SP) of the reserve of 

thread (RF) when the turn reaches the plate (19), so as 
to screen the receiver (18) from the light; the receiver 

emits a corresponding turn presence signal (s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a weft detecting 
optical device, particularly for detecting the presence of 
a reserve of weft and/or the breakage of the weft on weft 
feeders for looms and textile machines in general, and to a 
weft feeder including said device. As it is known, weft feeders are units that have a 
fixed drum on which a rotating arm winds a plurality of 
turns of thread that form a reserve of weft. The reserve 
turns unwind from the drum on demand of the loom or textile 
machine, and before the reserve is depleted said rotating 
arm winds other turns so as to constantly supply the 
reserve of turns; a series of rods that move in a wavelike 
manner causes the axial advancement of the turns fed from 
the base toward the head of the drum of the unit. A detection device, which is sensitive to the presence 
of the reserve turns of the thread, activates the rotating 
arm when the number of said turns of the reserve drops 
below a preset limit. Devices for detecting the presence of the turns of 
reserve thread, based on the use of one or more light ray 
emitting devices, generally constituted by photodiodes, and 
of one or more receivers for said light rays, generally 
constituted by phototransistors, are already known. There are essentially two known methods for using said 
light emitters and receivers. A first method consists in detecting, by means of the 
phototransistor, or receiver, the change produced by the  
 
interference of the thread in the light rays that are 
emitted by the photodiode and reflected by a mirror on top 
of which the turns of thread are arranged. A second known method consists in detecting the light 
rays that are reflected by said thread and emitted by said 
photodiode. For example, WO 92/09516 discloses a thread 
optical sensing device, which includes a combination of 
features as recited respectively in the preambles of the 
appended claims 1, 8 and 14, and which includes in 
particular: a light source aimed at a predetermined passage 
region for the thread; a receiver directed to receive 
scattered light reflected from the thread in the passage 
region; and a shield element arranged beneath the thread 
which is constructed or arranged such that it does not 
reflect the light from the light source to the receiver and 
does not allow light reflected from areas or objects on the 
other side of the shield element to reach the receiver. 
The shield element is a black plastic plate, or 
alternatively may consist of a material which allows the 
light coming from the
