<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a load transfer 
and loading device capable of measuring and displaying 
the weight of a load when it is loaded into a bucket. Among the various types of construction machines 
useful in civil engineering work for excavating base rocks 
or removing sediment, hydraulic shovels are the most widely 
used to transfer and load rocks and sediment. A hydraulic 
shovel has a structure in which booms extend from an upper 
structure supported on an undercarriage and sticks coupled 
to the end of the booms support the bucket. Sediment 
can be loaded into a bucket or unloaded from the bucket 
by oscillating movable sections using the corresponding 
driving hydraulic cylinder. In most cases, sediment in 
the bucket is loaded onto a truck suitable for sediment 
transfer. In such a case, however, since the maximum 
loading capacity per truck is limited by law, care must be 
taken so as not to exceed this maximum loading capacity. With the above conventional hydraulic shovel, the 
weight of sediment loaded into a bucket is normally 
determined by visual estimation by an operator. It is thus 
difficult to determine whether or not the total weight of 
the sediment loaded onto a truck has reached the maximum 
loading capacity and, therefore, the maximum loading 
capacity is often exceeded which may result in serious 
accidents. Otherwise, loading is often finished before 
the maximum loading capacity is reached which reduces 
loading efficiency. In addition, the visual estimation 
of weight tends to fail due to the difference in specific 
gravity of the sediment, i.e. two lamps of sediment of 
seemingly the same volume often have different weights 
due to such differences in specific gravity. In another method, a loading weight measurement 
device is used wherein the weight of a truck is measured 
twice: i.e. when the truck is empty and when a bucket  
 
is loaded, and the difference between the two measured 
values determines a loading weight. Even when such a 
device is used, the operator must conduct a trial-and-error 
operation to unload an excess of sediment from the truck 
when such excess loading is found. Such a trial-and-error 
operation, however, prevents the quick completion of 
loading to its maximum loading capacity. Another method 
has been proposed wherein, instead of measuring the loading 
weight of a truck, sediment loaded in a bucket is once 
emptied into a weighing equipment, the weight of the 
sediment is measured, the sediment is then taken back 
into the bucket, which
