<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is addressed to providing a simple method for labeling an object for its verification. The method of the present invention for labeling an object for its verification commences with applying to a location on said object a mark which creates a permanent impression thereof which is perceptible to the unaided eye and a mark which creates a permanent impression thereof which is imperceptible to the unaided eye, yet which can be determined by mechanical, electrical, and/or biologic means. In prior art a combination of UV dye and amino acid/protein fragment was used to label objects for their identification. The present invention broadens such dual labeled scheme to include a variety of additional "invisible" labeling techniques. Additionally, the present invention includes the recognition that, in order to stop counterfeiting of records and like consumer goods, a visible mark also must be present on the object. A hologram or other visible indicia would provide the owner (and the copyist) with one level of protection in ascertaining the genuiness of the object. The second means is "invisible" to the owner (and the copyist) and is designed to be difficult (if not impossible) for the copyist to duplicate.

 TFCHNTOIIE FOR LABELING AN OBJECT FOR TTS TDFNTTFTCATION AND/OR VERIFICATIONCross-Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-pait of United States Application Serial No.07/597,859, filed October 15, 1990, now U.S. Pat. No. , which in turn is a continuation-in-part of United States Application Serial No. 07/263,058, filed October 27, 1988, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of United States Application Serial No. 868,955, 'filed May 30, 1986, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of United States Application Serial No. 857,929, filed April 30, 1986, now abandoned, the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.Background of the InventionThe present invention relates to the labeling of objects for verifying authenticity and more particularly to the use of a selectively-perceptible mark in combination with a perceptible mark for labeling of objects.Many objects require verification for authenticity. Such objects include paintings, sculptures, cartoon cells, sports and other collectibles, and like works of art; video cassette recorders, televisions, and like household objects; and computers; printers, and like office and business equipment. Other instances of identification in order to verify ownership, include, for example, records, audio and video tape cassettes, computer software recorded on floppy disks or diskettes, perfumes, designer clothes, handbags, briefcases, cartoon cells, automobile/airplane parts, securities (e.g., stock certificates), wills, and like objects. Many American industries have been plagued by a flagrant piracy explosion over the past decade involving many of the foregoing products. Often, these objects have no serial number or other unique means of identification, or the number can be removed easily following a theft. Alternatively, counterfeiting of such objects has become a thriving business and the need to identify authentic from counterfeit objects is of great importance. Thus, a simple method for reliably identifying or authenticating such objects would be welcomed by the owners, the manufacturers of such objects, and even the U.S. Customs Service.Broad Statement of the InventionThe present invention is addressed to providing a simple, yet reliable method for labeling an object for its verification. Broadly, the method of the present invention for labeling an object for its verification and/or identification comprises applying to a predetermined location on said object, a mark which creates a permanent impression

<CLAIMS>
I claim:
1. Method for labeling an object for identification which comprises the steps of:
(a) applying a first mark to said object which mark is visible to the naked eye; and (b) applying a second mark to said object which mark is invisible to the naked eye.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein said first mark is one or more of an ink pattern, a picture, or a hologram.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein said invisible mark is one or more of an ultraviolet radiation (UV) dye which is visible only in the presence of selected ultraviolet radiation, an infrared (IR) dye which is visible only in the presence of selected infrared radiation, an ink which displays a selected measurable electrical resistivity, or a biologic marker.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein said first mark is a hologram which is overprinted with an ink which contains one or more of a UV dye, an IR dye, or a biologic marker.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein said first and second marks comprise visible ink which contains a UV dye and a biologic marker.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein said biologic marker is one or more of a protein, amino acid, DNA, polypeptide, hormone, or antibody.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein two or more second marks are applied to said object.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein said second marks comprise a UV dye and a biologic marker.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein said a fluid housed in a pen creates said first and said second marks.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein said fluid comprises an ink which creates a visible first mark. 


 11. The method of claim 5 wherein said ink is housed in a pen.
12. The method of claim 4 wherein said ink is housed in a pen.
13. Method for labeling an object for identification which comprises the steps of:
(a) applying a first mark to said object which mark is visible to the naked eye; and (b) applying a second mark to said object which mark is invisible to the naked eye; and
(c) applying a third mark to said object which mark is invisible to the naked eye.
14. The method of claim 13 wherein said marks are created from an ink housed in a pen.
15. The method of claim 13 wherein said invisible mark is two or more of an ultraviolet radiation (UV) dye which is visible only in the presence of selected ultraviolet radiation, an infrared (IR) dye which is visible only in the presence of selected infrared radiation, an ink which displays a selected measurable electrical resistivity, or a biologic marker.
16. The method of claim 13 wherein said first mark is a hologram which is overprinted with an ink which contains two or more of a UV dye, an IR dye, or a biologic marker.
17. The method of claim 13 wherein said biologic marker is one or more of a protein, amino acid, DNA, polypeptide, hormone, or antibody.
