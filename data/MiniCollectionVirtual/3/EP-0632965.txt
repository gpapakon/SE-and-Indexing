<ABSTRACT>
It is necessary in medical engineering, the foodstuffs industry and also in other sectors to treat, for example to sterilise, products in a number of steps. This is normally carried out by treatment of the products (6) in batches by means of process media in a treatment unit taking the form of an autoclave. The invention provides for a sequence of individual treatment units (1,1a,1b) which are preferably moved in steps and are provided with the process medium (2,3) which is necessary in each case in a position-dependent manner.

Process for the treatment of lump products by means of process media in the
framework of a sequence of process steps (treatment steps) in a treatment unit, with

the steps:

As a treatment unit, a circular chain of individual chambers is formed, in which the
lump products are taken up in a small batch and remain so for the duration of the

sequence of process steps;
In the chain, divided over the separate individual chambers, the individual process
steps of the sequence take place simultaneously;
The sequence of the process steps in the individual chambers of the chain, or in
groups thereof begins in a specified cycle with temporal offsetting, and;
The temporal offsetting (cycle) is specified by a common control or regulating unit.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the common control unit is
established mechanically in the form of a transport system for the individual chambers,

that the individual chambers are transported to different locations, in which at least
one treatment stage is carried out, and that the beginning of the treatment is specified

by the location of each individual chamber.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the individual chambers are
transported further during treatment, and the temporal displacement of the beginning

of the treatment is additionally determined by the common control or regulating unit
for the process media.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the individual chambers are
transported stepwise one after another to the treatment locations, and that the chain 

of individual chambers is formed such that, in each case, a new individual chamber is
loaded when the previous loaded individual chamber is transported into the next

treatment step, and a treated individual chamber is unloaded when the following
individual chamber has been transported to the last treatment step.
Device for the treatment of lump products (6) by means of process media derived
from a supply unit (10) in the framework of a sequence of process steps (treatment

steps) in a treatment unit, 
characterised in that
:

The treatment unit consists of a plurality of at least three separate individual chambers
(1, 1a, 1b) arranged in circular fashion in a chain, which in each case features at least

one inflow and outflow (2, 3) for the process media, in which the lump products (6)
are taken up in the form of a small batch and remain so for the duration of the

sequence of process steps.
The inflows and outflows (2, 3) of the individual chambers are connected to the
supply unit (10) in such a way that in the chain, divided over the individual chambers,

the individual process steps of the sequence take place simultaneously;
A common control or regulating unit (12, 13) is provided for, which is designed and
connected to the individual chambers (1, 1a, 1b) in such a way that the sequence of

process steps in the individual chambers of the chain or groups thereof begins
temporally offset in a predetermined cycle.
Device according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
:

As the common control unit, a cyclic drive arrangement (12, 13) is allocated to the
individual chambers (1, 1a, 1b) for the generation of a stepped movement of the

individual chambers with a characteristic number of stopping stations (I, II, III), in
which specific treatment steps take place, and; 
Connection systems (9) for the process media are provided for, which on one side are
permanently connected to a fixed-location supply unit (10), and which, on the other

side, are capable of being brought into operational engagement with the inflow and
outflow (2, 3) of the individual chambers (1, 1a, 1b) in a manner specific to the

stopping stations, so that the individual chambers are capable of being imposed, in the
stopping stations, from the fixed-position supply unit, in a position-dependent manner

with the process medium necessary for the individual treatment step in question.
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that
 the individual chambers (1, 1a,
1b) are arranged mounted in circular fashion on a rotating dolly (12), and the cyclic

drive arrangement features a rotary drive system (12, 13).
Device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
, for the position-dependent
imposition of the individual chambers (1, 1a, 1b) with process media, a rotary infeed

device (4) is provided for, which features on the one hand a stator (24) with apertures
(25) located therein, which is rigidly connected to the connection systems (9), and

which on the other hand also features a rotor (23) with the apertures located therein,
which is rigidly connected to the rotating dolly (12) and is guided at the inflows and

outflows (2, 3) of the individual chambers, and that the apertures in the stator and
rotor are matched to one another in their spatial location in such a way that,

dependent on the angle of rotation, in each case the process line of the connection

systems (9), required for the treatment, is connected to the inflows and outflows of
the individual chambers located in the stopping stations concerned.
