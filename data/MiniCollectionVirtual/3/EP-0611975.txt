<ABSTRACT>
A subassembly (10) for use in packaging an optoelectronic device 
(e.g., LED or photodiode 11) includes a semiconductor (e.g., silicon) base (22) 

and lid (24) having a variety of etched features (e.g., grooves, cavities, alignment 
detents) and metalization patterns (e.g., contacts, reflectors) which enable the 

device to be reliably and inexpensively mounted on the base and coupled to the 
fiber (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lightwave devices and more particularly to a
subassembly used in packaging optoelectronic devices such as photodiodes and
light emitting diodes (LEDs).Conventional packages for discrete optoelectronic devices typically are
made out of a variety of dissimilar materials, such as metal, glass and ceramic,
and involve relatively complicated manipulation of components during assembly.
U. S. Patents No. 4,357,072 (LED), 4,119,363 (laser) and 4,233,619
(photodetector) are illustrative. Assembly involves manipulating components in
three dimensions in order to place the components in the desired locations; for
example, alignment of a device to a substrate, alignment of a fiber to a ferrule,
alignment of a ferrule to a package, and finally alignment of the package to the
device. These alignment steps depend upon fairly specialized, expensive
equipment. In general, therefore, z-axis assembly is not possible in those designs;
that is, one cannot simply move the components along a z-axis perpendicular to
the substrate and place them on the substrate without further orientation being
required in the x-y plane. In addition, because the packages include dissimilar
materials, great care is required to insure that the thermal-expansion coefficients
are adjusted in such a way that the alignments are stable even though the ambient
temperature changes. Instability, of course, leads to mechanical movement of the
components and consequently to a decrease in optical coupling between, for
example, the device and the fiber. Often this situation leads package designers to
compromise between thermal sinking and stability criteria. At the very least, it
increases cost.For many expensive applications, notably long haul transmission
systems, the relatively high cost of manufacturing such packages can be tolerated.
However, for some cost sensitive, high volume applications, such as lightwave
systems between central switching offices or remote-terminals and subscribers'
homes (known as the subscriber loop), the high cost of such packages renders
them unsuitable.Thus, it would be desirable to have a packaging scheme which
(1) uses, as much as possible, commercially available equipment for the
production of the pieceparts, for the alignment of the parts, and for closing of the
package; and (2) which accommodates different size packages for different
applications without requiring extensive retooling or new assembly techniques. 
For example, it would be desirable, on the one hand, to have a subassembly which
fits
