<DESCRIPTION>
Materials which satisfy the requirements of strength, toughness,
and corrosion resistance, and also of anti-stress corrosion
cracking property are disclosed in Examined Japanese Patent
Publication No. 61-3391, Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No.
58-199850 and 61-207550. Those materials show a resistance to an
environment containing only a slight quantity of H2S, but they
generate stress-corrosion cracking in an environment at over 0.01
atm. of H2S partial pressure. So those materials can not be used
in an environment containing a large amount of H2S.On the other hand, some of martensitic stainless steels which have
an improved anti-stress corrosion cracking property in an
environment exceeding 0.01 atm. of H2S partial pressure are
introduced. Examples of that type of martensitic stainless steel
are disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 60-174859
and 62-54063. Those materials are, however, also unable to
completely prevent stress corrosion cracking caused by H2S.From the viewpoint of strength, a trial for improving the strength
on all the martensitic stainless steels described above resulted
in a significant degradation of their toughness and anti-stress
corrosion cracking property.US 3,720,545 teaches the preparation of corrosion resistant
steel moulds which are particularly suited for plasticinjection
molding. The hardness of this steel is adjusted to
a Brinell hardness of 300 to 350 for optimum machinability. EP-O-384 317 discloses high strength martensitic stainless
steels excellent in corrrosion resistance and stress corrosion
cracking to be used in drilling or transporting crude oil or
natural gas with the composition. ≤ 0.1 % C, ≤ 1.0 % Si,
≤ 2% Mn, 8-14% Cr, 1.2-4.5 % Cu, 0.005-0.2 Al,
0.01-0.15 N, and the balance Fe with unavoidable imporities.
The steels are austeritized at temperatures of 920°C to 1100°C,
cooled and tempered at temperatures between 580°C and
AC1 point.Accordingly, all those martensitic stainless steels have an
unavoidable problem in that either toughness or anti-stress
corrosion cracking property is sacrificed. As a result, those
martensitic stainless steels can not be used as a deep OCTG (Oil
Country Tubular Goods), for example, for which a high strength, 
anti-stress corrosion cracking property, anti-corrosion property,
and toughness at the same time is requested.It is an object of the present invention to provide a high-strength
martensitic stainless steel which is applicable even in an
environment containing a large amount of H2S while
