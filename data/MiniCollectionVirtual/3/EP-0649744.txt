<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a system for
operating, monitoring and controlling a plurality of elements,
such as printing press machinery and associated accessories and
auxiliaries. More particularly, the invention relates to a
unified system for operating, monitoring, and controlling a
plurality of elements, such as printing press machinery and
associated auxiliaries and accessories with a central control
element which eliminates the redundancy of controls normally
associated with each individual printing press machine,
accessory or auxiliary, and which produces a desired set of
printing conditions characteristic of a finished printed
product by automatically relating particular printing job
requirements associated with the finished printed product to
the appropriate machine language functions of the associated
printing press machinery and accessories and/or auxiliaries.The production of final, finished printed products
employing conventional offset lithography is oftentimes a
complicated task. An offset printing production line generally
includes a multitude of printing presses and accessories and/or
auxiliaries, all of which must be simultaneously controlled and
monitored as a necessary part of obtaining a finished printed
product.Referring to Figure 13, a typical offset printing
production line may include one or more of the following
systems: sheet cleaner systems 131; systems 132 for cleaning
the impression cylinders and blanket cylinders of printing
presses, such as the Automatic Blanket Cleaner ("ABC") produced
and sold by Baldwin Technology Company of Stamford,
Connecticut; a plurality of printing press units 133,134,135
corresponding to a number of ink colors necessary to produce a
final printed product; dryer units 136 to dry the various
sheets, including but not limited to infrared and/or
ultraviolet systems; various ink and solvent supply and 
circulator systems 137; print temperature management systems
138; and the like.In prior practice, each of the various systems
(hereinafter generally referred to as printing press machinery
and accessories and/or auxiliaries) often included separate,
individual "control" or "user" stations, each of which had to
be individually programmed and controlled by a pressman who was
operating the printing line. This, oftentimes, led to undue
clutter and confusion in the press operating environment, owing
to the extraordinary number of separate control systems.
Moreover, each individual control system typically operated
with its own unique "machine"
