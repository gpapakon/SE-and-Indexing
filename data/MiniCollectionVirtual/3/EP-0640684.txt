<ABSTRACT>
A spray dried phosphate-free ultra concentrated powdered automatic 
dishwashing detergent composition containing a mixture of protease enzyme and 

an amylase enzymes have been found to be very useful in the cleaning of 
dishware. The compositions contain nonionic surfactants, a builder salt system, a 

zeolite and an alkali metal silicate and optionally bleaching agent and bleaching 
activator.

<DESCRIPTION>
It has been found to be very useful to have enzymes in dishwashing 
detergent compositions because enzymes are very effective in removing food soils 
from the surface of glasses, dishes, pots, pans and eating utensils. The enzymes 
attack these materials while other components of the detergent will effect other 
aspects of the cleaning action. However, in order for the enzymes to be highly 
effective, the composition must be chemically stable, and it must maintain an 
effective activity at the operating temperature of the automatic dishwasher. 
Chemical stability, such as to bleaching agents, is the property whereby the 
detergent composition containing enzymes does not undergo any significant 
degradation during storage. Activity is the property of maintaining enzyme activity 
during usage. From the time that a detergent is packaged until it is used by the 
customer, it must remain stable. Furthermore, during customer usage of the 
dishwashing detergent, it must retain its activity. Unless the enzymes in the 
detergent are maintained in a minimum exposure to moisture or water, the 
enzymes will suffer a degradation during storage which will result in a product that 
will have a decreased activity. When enzymes are a part of the detergent 
composition, it has been found that the initial water content of the components of 
the composition should be as low a level as possible, and this low water content 
must be maintained during storage, since water will deactivate the enzymes. This 
deactivation will cause a decrease in the initial activity of the detergent 
composition. After the detergent container is opened, the detergent will be exposed to the 
environment which contains moisture. During each instance that the detergent is 
exposed to the environment it could possibly absorb some moisture. This  
 
absorption occurs by components of the detergent composition absorbing 
moisture, when in contact with the atmosphere. This effect is increased as the 
container is emptied, since there will be a greater volume of air in contact with the 
detergent, and thus more available moisture to be absorbed by the detergent 
composition. This will usually accelerate the decrease in the activity of the 
detergent composition. The most efficient way to keep a high activity is to start with 
an initial high activity of enzyme and to use components in the dishwashing 
composition which do not interact with the enzyme or which have a low water 
affinity which will minimize any losses in activity as the detergent is being
