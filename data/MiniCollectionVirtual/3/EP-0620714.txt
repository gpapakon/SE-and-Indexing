<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toothbrush of the 
kind having a pair of heads capable of cleaning two sides 
of a tooth simultaneously. Toothbrushes are known which have two fixed heads 
which face one another and from which bristles extend 
towards those of the other head. These toothbrushes have 
two disadvantages. Firstly, they have a fixed gap between 
the bristles so that different thicknesses of teeth can not 
be uniformly cleaned. Secondly, the twin heads make the 
end of the toothbrush far more bulky than a conventional 
toothbrush and thus it is difficult to clean one side of a 
tooth alone. GB-A-1320380 discloses a toothbrush which can fit in 
a small package. The toothbrush has two head parts which 
can be pivoted between a flat position where the bristles 
of the head parts face away from one another and a useable 
position in which the head parts lie side by side with the 
bristles facing in the same direction. GB-A-2192784, which forms the basis of the preamble of claim 1, 
discloses a toothbrush comprising two 
halves, each consisting of an elongate handle with, at one 
end a head carrying bristles, whereby the two halves can be 
moved between a first position in which the heads lie 
closely side by side with the bristles extending in 
substantially the same direction, and a second position in 
which the heads are spaced apart with the bristles of each 
head extending towards those of the other head; and wherein 
the end of each half remote from the head is provided with 
a respective peg positioned such that the spacing between 
the pegs is the same in the first and second positions, 
whereby the toothbrush can be held in the first and second 
positions by a retainer having two sockets which are 
complementary to the pegs in the first and second 
positions, and according to the present invention, such a 
toothbrush is characterised by the two halves being hinged 
together using a film hinge about an axis extending  
 
substantially parallel to the lengths of the handles, so 
that the two halves can be pivoted about the axis between 
the first and second positions. With this arrangement, the toothbrush can be used in 
a first position as a conventional toothbrush and in a 
second position in which the brush can be used to clean two 
sides of the tooth simultaneously. An example of a toothbrush constructed in accordance 
with the present invention will now be described with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
