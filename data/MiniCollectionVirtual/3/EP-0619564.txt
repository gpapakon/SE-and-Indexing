<ABSTRACT>
An automated transaction system employs microprocessor-bearing user cards each 
issued to a respective user for maintainig a history of user account transactions and a 

user account balance, microprocessor-bearing master cards issued to vendors for 
maintaining a history of master account transactions and a master account balance, and 

terminals in which a user card and a master card are inserted for performing account 
transfer transactions wherein value from the account balance of one card is debited and 

the account balance of the other card is correspondingly credited. A transaction history 
recorder is used to produce or record the transaction history stored in the card for the 

user of the vendor. In the preferred embodiment, each master card is assigned to a 
respective terminal of a vendor and maintains a history of the transactions executed at 

that terminal between the master card and user cards presented for transactions at the 
terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automated transaction
system which receives with a user card having a microprocessor
for executing secure transactions in which an
article or item of value is dispensed from a terminal, and
an account balance stored in the card's memory is debited.
Such a system is described in WO 83/03018. The
invention is applicable to a postage transaction system
in which a postage account is maintained within the microprocessor
card and is used in transactions with postage
printing and metering terminals.Apparatus for effecting and recording monetary
transactions to simulate the function of a conventional
wallet is described in EP-A-0 172 670.Point-of-sale (POS) terminals and automated teller
machines (ATM) have been widely used in conjunction
with various types of cards issued to users for sale or
credit transactions. For example, banks regularly issue
account cards which have a magnetically coded number
stored on a stripe for accessing the user's account
through ATM terminals. Credit cards which have coded
magnetic stripes are inserted in ATM or POS terminals
to access a central account system for authorization of
a credit transaction. There also have been proposals to
use cards which have large non-volatile memories, e.g.
magnetic, integrated circuit (IC), or optical memory storage,
for storing and retrieving information specific to the
user, such as a medical history, biographical history,
maintenance of an account balance and transaction history,
etc.These conventional systems generally employ a
card which has a passive memory that is read in a card
reader or computerized terminal maintained by a vendor.
The security of the cards is problematic since most
account cards used conventionally are passive and do
not authenticate themselves or the particular transactions
for which they are used. Instead, on-line access
through a terminal to a central account system, such as
bank or credit card account records, is required for confirmation
of each transaction. This requirement places
an access time and cost burden on vendors, such as
bank branches and retail stores, which must maintain
the terminal facilities, as well as on the operator of the
central account system, which must provide sufficient
on-line access for all the users of the system and ensure
the security of the entire system.By comparison, off-line transactions, i.e. between a
user with an authorized card and a terminal not connected
to a central account system, have the advantage that
the vendor does not have to confirm each

An automated transaction system comprising a transaction terminal
(20) having a receiving slot for insertion of a portable user card (10) therein,

and a plurality of user cards issued to different users, each user card having
a microprocessor (60) and a memory incorporated therein for performing

value transactions through the terminal and maintaining a history of value
transactions and user account balance therein, and a data output device

(175) connected to the microprocessor of the user card, wherein:

a plurality of master cards (160) are issued for refilling user account
balances of user cards (10) via refilling transaction terminals (20"), each

master card (160) having a microprocessor (162) and a memory incorporated
therein for maintaining a history of refilling transactions and a master account

balance therein, and a data output device (163) connected to the
microprocessor of the master card;
a plurality of refilling transaction terminals are provided, each refilling
transaction terminal having a first receiving slot (174) for receiving a user

card inserted therein and establishing a connection with the user card data
output device, a second receiving slot (161) for receiving a master card

inserted therein and establishing a connection with the master card data
output device, an operating section for performing a set of desired terminal

functions, and a first data path for connecting the user card microprocessor
of a user card inserted in the first receiving slot with the master card

microprocessor of a master card inserted in the second receiving slot of the
terminal; and
the user cards and master cards have respective stored programs
operable for mutual interaction for executing a refilling transaction between a user card and a master card

inserted in the refilling terminal wherein account value from the account 
balance maintained in the master card is debited and the account balance of

the user card is correspondingly credited;

   
characterized in that
:

a master card is assigned to a supervisor card for use in a respective one of the plurality of refilling
terminals and is used to maintain a history of refilling transactions executed

between the master card and a series of user cards through the
refilling terminal;
said supervisor card (170) has a microprocessor (172) and
a memory incorporated therein, and a data output device connected to the

microprocessor;
each refilling terminal has a third receiving slot (171) for insertion of said

supervisor card (170) therein and a second data path for connecting the
master card microprocessor (162) of a master card (160) inserted in the

second receiving slot (161) with the supervisor card microprocessor (172) of
the supervisor card inserted in the third receiving slot of the terminal;
the supervisor card microprocessor (172) and memory includes a
stored program for communicating with the master card microprocessor (162)

to authorize the master card to execute refilling transactions with user cards
through an assigned refilling terminal (20"); and
