<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fabrics comprising
a melt-stable, biodegradable lactide polymer composition
and a process for manufacturing such fabrics from a
melt-stable, biodegradable lactide polymer.The need for and uses of fabrics, particularly
nonwoven fabrics, have increased tremendously in recent
years. Production of nonwoven roll goods was estimated
at 2.5 billion pounds in 1992. Nonwoven fabrics are
presently used for coverstock, interlinings, wipes,
carrier sheets, furniture and bedding construction,
filtration, apparel, insulation, oil cleanup products,
cable insulating products, hospital drapes and gowns,
battery separators, outerwear construction, diapers and
feminine hygiene products.There are basically three different manufacturing
industries which make fabrics, such as nonwovens; the
textile, paper and extrusion industries. The textile
industry garnets, cards or aerodynamically forms textile
fibers into oriented webs. The paper industry employs
technology for converting dry laid pulp and wet laid
paper systems into nonwoven fabrics. The extrusion
industry uses at least three methods of nonwoven
manufacture, those being the spunbond, melt blown and
porous film methods. The melt blown method involves
extruding a thermoplastic resin through a needle thin
die, exposing the extruded fiber to a jet of hot air and
depositing the "blown" fiber on a conveyor belt. These
fibers are randomly orientated to form a web. The
spunbond method also utilizes a needle thin die, but
orients or separates the fibers in some manner. The
porous film method employs both slit and annular dies.
In one method, a sheet is extruded and drawn,
fibrillization occurs and a net-like fabric results. In order to meet projected needs for biodegradable
packaging materials, others have endeavored to optimize
lactide polymer processing systems. Gruber et al. (U.S.
Pat. No. 5,142,023) disclose a continuous process for
the manufacture of lactide polymers with controlled
optical purity from lactic acid having physical
properties suitable for replacing present petrochemical-based
polymers.Prior to the present invention, it is believed that
there has been no disclosure of a combination of
composition control and melt stability requirements
which will lead to the production of commercially viable
lactide polymer nonwoven fabrics.It is generally known that lactide polymers or
poly(lactide) are unstable. The concept of instability
has both negative and positive aspects. A positive
aspect is the biodegradation or other forms of
degrada
