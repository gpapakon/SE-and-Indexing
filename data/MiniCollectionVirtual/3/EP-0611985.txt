<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic light-sensitive emulsion is 
disclosed. The emulsion comprises silver halide grains formed 

under a condition in which fine grains of silver halide are 
supplied into the protective colloid solution, in which the 

silver halide grains are formed, in a period in the course of 
formation of the grains, and

 
   the sum of projection area of tabular grains each having 

a aspect ratio larger than 1.2 accounts for lower than 50 % of 
the total projection area of the whole silver halide grains of 

the emulsion, and the tabular grains have an average aspect 
ratio is more than 1.2 and less than 5.0 and an average grain 

size of not larger than 0.6 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic
emulsion improved in preservation stabilities of sensitivity,
graininess and image-sharpness and to a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material applied with the above-mentioned
emulsion.In recent years, photographic equipments such as a camera
and so forth have been getting popularized, and there have
been increased photographic picture-taking opportunities with
the use of a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material. Accordingly, there have been more serious demands
for making a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material higher in sensitivity and image quality.One of the dominant factors for making a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material higher in sensitivity 
and image quality is a silver halide grain. Therefore, the
researches and developments of silver halide grains have so
far been aimed in the art for making sensitivity and image
quality more higher.However, when making the grain size of silver halide
grain smaller for improving an image quality, their
sensitivity is liable to be lowered, therefore, there has been
a limitation to make both high sensitivity and high image
quality compatible.For trying to make sensitivity and image quality more
higher, the techniques for improving a sensitivity/grain size
ratio per individual silver halide grain have been studied.
As for one of the techniques, a technique in which tabular-shaped
silver halide grains are used is described in, for
example, Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection
(hereinafter abbreviated to JP OPI Publication) Nos. 58-111935/1983,
58-111936/1983, 58-111937/1983, 58-113927/1983
and 59-99433/1984. When comparing these tabular-shaped silver
halide grain to the so-called normal crystal silver halide
grain having an octahedral, tetradecahedral or hexahedral
crystal form, the former grain has a surface area wider than
in the latter when the volume of them are the same.
Therefore, the former grain has an advantage for making a
sensitivity more higher, because more sensitizing dyes can be
adsorbed to the surfaces of silver halide grain. Also, JP OPI Publication No. 63-92942/1988 describes a
technique for putting a core having a high silver iodide
content inside a tabular-shaped silver halide grain; JP OPI
Publication No. 63-151618/1988 describes a technique for
making use of a hexagonal tabular-shaped silver halide grain;
JP OPI Publication No. 63-163451/1988 describes a technique
for making use of a tabular-shaped silver halide grain

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a silver halide emulsion in
which the sum of projection area of tabular grains each

having an aspect ratio larger than 1.2 accounts for not less
than 50% of the whole projection area of all grains and the

tabular grains have an average aspect ratio of more than 1.2
and less than 5.0 and an average grain size of not larger

than 0.6 µm, wherein the process comprises the step of
supplying fine grains of silver halide comprising twinned

crystals in a ratio of not less than 70% in number of total
number of fine grains, into a protective colloid solution, in

which the silver halide grains of said silver halide emulsion
are grown, in the course of the steps in order from a step of

growing a grain from the seed grain, a desalting step, a step
of dispersing the silver halide grain, until the end of a chemical

sensitizing step and color sensitizing step.
The process of claim 1, wherein said tabular grains have an
average aspect ratio of not less than 1.5 and less than 4.5.

average aspect ratio of not less than 2.0 and less than 4.0.
The process of claim 1, wherein said tabular grains have an
average grain size of 0.2 µm co 0.6 µm.
The process of claim 4, wherein said tabular grains have an
average grain size of 0.3 µm to 0.6 µm.
A process of claim 1. wherein an average grain size of the
seed grain is 0.03 to 0.25µm.
A process of claim 6, wherein an average grain size of the
seed grain is 0.05 to 0.20µm.
A process of claim 1, wherein an average grain size of the
silver hailde fine grains is not larger than 0.05 µm.
A process of claim 1, wherein the step of supplying the fine
grains of silver halide is prior to the desalting step.
