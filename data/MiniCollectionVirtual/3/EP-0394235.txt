<ABSTRACT>
In a process for smooth feed of elastic thread to the knitting system of a circular knitting machine having a thread feed device controlled by an electronic control unit, the position signals (P) are counted on the basis of a reference signal (A) and the stop signal (S) is produced only for a predetermined number of position signals, or the reference signal (A) is ignored during a predetrmined time-interval ( DELTA t) and the stop signal (S) is produced when this time-interval has elapsed, the predetermination being effected in function of the quality of the thread and/or the distance between the thread feed device and the knitting system. In this way, a subsequent feed is obtained which permits the tension of the elastic thread to be released. The circular knitting machine (1) contains a delay circuit (19) for the stop signal (S) in the electronic control unit (3) of the thread feed device (2).

Method for the positive feed of an elastic yarn to a 
knitting system of a circular knitting machine, with an 

electronic control unit for a positive yarn feed device, 
the control unit generating a start and a stop signal, 

respectively, for an electric drive motor of the positive 
yarn feed device in accordance with the laying-in and 

laying-out of the yarn by a yarn guide in the knitting 
system and transmitting these signals to the motor, and 

the control unit being supplied with signals derived from 
the working movement of the knitting machine in 

accordance with position in order to control the drive 
motor between the start and the stop signal by means of 

speed signals corresponding to the yarn consumption,

laying-out signal (A), the position signals (p) are 
counted in the control unit (3) and compared with a 

predetermined, stored number of signals (ΔP), that the 
stop signal (S) is transmitted to the drive motor as soon 

as the counted number of signals corresponds with the 
stored number of signals (ΔP), and that the number of 

signals (ΔP) is predetermined in accordance with the yarn 
quality and/or the yarn length between the yarn feed 

device and the knitting system such that the yarn is 
essentially relaxed between the feed device and the 

knitting system when the drive motor is at a standstill.
