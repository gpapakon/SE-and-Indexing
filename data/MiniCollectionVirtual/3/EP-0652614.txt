<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid-state
laser device which can be used in the industrial field,
medical field, and the like.A conventional solid-state laser device generally
comprises an arrangement wherein an optical fiber is
connected to a laser generator to guide a laser beam to
an arbitrary position, or an arrangement wherein a laser
resonator including a solid-state laser medium is housed
in a housing different from that for a pumping light
source, and the laser resonator and the light source are
connected via an optical fiber so that they can be
disassembled from each other, as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,665,529.Fig. 1 shows the arrangement of a conventional
solid-state laser device. Reference numeral 20 denotes
a semiconductor laser for generating a laser beam having
a wavelength of 809 nm; 21, a laser beam emitted from
the semiconductor laser 20; 22, a collimator lens; 23, a
focusing lens; and 24, a solid-state laser medium (e.g.,
Nd:YAG). A coating film which has a transmittance of
99.5% for a wavelength of 809 nm and a reflectance of
99.9% for a wavelength of 1.064 µm is formed on a facet
24a of the solid-state laser medium 24, and a coating 
film which has a transmittance of 99.9% for a wavelength
of 1.064 µm is formed on the other facet 24b. Reference
numeral 25 denotes a reflection mirror. A coating film
which has a reflectance of 97% for a wavelength of 1.064
µm is formed on a facet 25a of the reflection mirror 25.
Reference numeral 27 denotes a focusing lens; 28, an
optical fiber cable; 29, an output laser beam; and 30, a
device main body.The operation of the conventional solid-state laser
device with the above-mentioned arrangement will be
explained below. The laser beam 21 having a wavelength
of 809 nm, which is generated by the semiconductor laser
20, is shaped into a collimated beam by the collimator
lens 22, and the collimated beam is focused on the facet
24b of the solid-state laser medium 24 by the focusing
lens 23, thus pumping the solid-state laser medium 24.
Light pumped in the solid-state laser medium 24
reciprocates between the facet 24a and the facet 25a of
the reflection mirror 25 to cause laser generation, and
then emerges from the reflection mirror 25 as a laser
beam 26 having a wavelength of 1.064 µm. Thereafter,
the laser beam 26 is focused by the focusing lens 27,
and is incident on an incident end 28a of the optical
fiber cable. The laser beam 26 is guided to a distal
end portion 28b via the optical fiber cable 28, and
emerges from the optical fiber cable as
