<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to the family of molecules known as the 
transforming growth factor betas, or "TGF-βs". More 
"pecifically, it refers to new complexes of these molecules, 
sometimes referred to as "large latent" or "LL" complexes. Transforming growth factor beta, or "TGF-β" as used hereafter, 
refers to a family of multifunctional, dimeric polypeptides 
having a molecular weight of about 25000 daltons. See U.S. 
Patent No. 4,931,548 to Lucas et al., 
as well as Lyons et al., Eur. J. 
Biochem 187: 467-473 (1990); Massagué, Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 6: 
597-641 (1990); Roberts et al., in Peptide Growth Factors And 
Their Receptors, part 1 (Sporn et al., ed), pp. 419-472 (1990); 
Sporn et al., Science 233: 532-534 (1986); Massagué, Trends in 
Biochem. Sci. 10: 239-240 (1985). The TGF-βs have been found to 
stimulate certain cell types and to inhibit others with respect 
to cell growth and differentiation. They also influence 
adipogenesis, myogenesis, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, 
epithelial cell differentiation and immune cell function. See 
Lucas et al., supra. At least three related isoforms of TGF-β have been identified, 
i.e., "TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and TGF-β3". Although related, their 
properties are not identical, as summarized by, e.g., Graycar et 
al., Mol. Endrocrinol 3: 1977-1986 (1989), Cheifetz et al., J. 
Biol. Chem. 265: 20533-10538 (1990). Promoter regions of the 
three isoforms vary considerably, and their production is 
differently regulated, as painted out by Roberts et al., Ciba 
Found. Symp. 157: 7-28 (1991). TGF-β molecules have been observed to be produced in  
 
inactive, high molecular weight forms. For example, TGF-β1, 
isolated from human and rat platelets, have been found as a 
complex of three components, referred to hereafter as the 
"large latent complex", the "LL" complex or "LLTGF-β1". This 
complex consists of a dimer of the active TGF-β1 molecule, 
i.e., the 25 KDa structure referred to supra. It also 
includes a molecular moiety referred to as the "latency 
associated peptide" or "β1-LAP", and a larger molecule, 
referred to as the latent TGF-β1 binding protein or "LTBP". 
As to the high molecular weight forms, see Pircher et al., 
Canc. Res. 44: 5538-5543 (1984); Wakefield et al., J. Cell 
Biol. 105: 965-975 (1987). As to β1-LAP and LTBP, see 
Miyazono et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263: 6407-6415 (1988); 
Wakefield et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263: 7646-7654 (1988); and 
Okada et al., J. Biochem 106: 304-310 (1989). Latent TGF-β1 
can be activated in vitro via various physical and
