<ABSTRACT>
Element assembly for paving roads and the like, developing a filtering effect for flowing fluids and having at least two superimposed coatings (1, 2, 3 ...) in the direction of flow from the upper entry side to the lower exit side, in which the upper layer on the entry side is substantially thinner than each of the underlying layers (2, 3 ...) and the free through-flow sections (a) of the layer on the entry side are smaller than the free through-flow sections (b, c ...) of each of the underlying layers (2, 3 ...), whereby the dimensions of the free through-flow sections (a, b, c ...) increase in the successive layers in the direction of flow.

<CLAIMS>
Ground-surfacing assembly, which exhibits a 
filter action for fluids flowing through it and is formed 

from porous material, such as concrete or plastic, having 
at least two superposed layers (1, 2, 3 ...) in the 

direction of flow from the inlet upper side to the outlet 
underside, the inlet-side upper layer (1) of which is 

significantly thinner than each of the layers (2, 3 ...) 
underneath it, and the free flow cross-section (a), 

formed by the pores of the porous material, of the inlet-side 
layer (1) of which is smaller than the free flow 

cross-sections (b, c ...) of each of the layers (2, 3 
...) underneath it, the dimensions of the free flow 

cross-sections (a, b, c ...) increasing in the layers 
which follow one another in the direction of flow, 

characterized in that additional free flow cross-sections 
(a, b, c ...) are formed in all the layers (1, 2, 3 ...) 

by ducts formed by means of taper plugs and the like, 
which ducts ar
e essentially continuously conical or are 
stepped from layer to layer, and in that the additional 

flow cross-sections (a, b, c ...) also increase in the 
layers (1, 2, 3 ...) which follow one another in the 

direction of flow (D). 
Ground-surfacing element, which can be laid in 
bond form to produce a ground-surfacing assembly, 

contains porous material, such as concrete or plastic, 
and exhibits a filter action for fluids flowing through 

it, the porous material having at least two superposed 
layers (1, 2, 3 ...) in the direction of flow from the 

inlet upper side to the outlet underside, the inlet-side 
layer (1) of which is significantly thinner than each of  

 
the layers (2, 3 ...) underneath it, and the free flow 

cross-sections (a, b, c ...), formed by the pores of the 
porous material, of each layer (1, 2, 3 ...) of which 

increase from layer to layer in the direction of flow, 
characterized in that additional free flow cross-sections 

(a, b, c ...) are formed in all the layers (1, 2, 3 ...) 
by ducts formed by means of taper plugs and the like, 

which ducts are essentially continuously conical or are 
stepped from layer to layer, and in that the additional 

flow cross-sections (a, b, c ...) also increase in the 
layers (1, 2, 3 ...) which follow one another in the 

direction of flow (D). 
Ground-surfacing element according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the porous material is surrounded 

and held by a frame body (4), the frame orifice of which 
tapers from the top downwards.
