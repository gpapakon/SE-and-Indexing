Adsorption unit intended to be inserted in
a patient circuit of a closed-circuit anaesthesia

system, the unit (1) comprising a container (3)
containing a dose of adsorbent (13) and having a bottom

(4) and an open end, and means (5) for securing the
container to a support plate (2) that defines a portion

of the patient circuit (8, 11), a gas pipe, which can
be connected to the patient circuit, passing through

the adsorbent, characterized in that the container (3)
is secured to the support plate (2) by its open end and

in that the dose of adsorbent is contained in a
cartridge (12) that can be inserted into the container

(3) and comprises gas-permeable annular axial faces
(16, 17) and a central tube (18) connectable to a

portion (8) of the patient circuit.
Unit according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the cartridge (12) comprises a leak-tight

peripheral wall (15) connected to two perforated end
walls (16, 17).
Unit according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that the cartridge (12) and the

container (3) are cylindrical.
Unit according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the open end of the container comprises a screw-threaded

means (5) collaborating with a tapped means in
the support plate (2).
Unit according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the support plate (2) comprises a valve (9) placed

in a downstream portion (11) of the patient circuit and 
collaborating, towards an open position, with the

cartridge (12) when the container (3) is mounted on the
plate (2).
Unit according to Claim 4 or Claim 5,
characterized in that the container (3) is mounted such

that it is suspended from the plate (2).
Unit according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the adsorbent (13)

consists of soda lime granules.
Unit according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the central tube (18)

projects with respect to one (16) of the axial faces
(16, 17) of the cartridge (12).
Unit according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the central tube (18) is housed with sliding in

part (7) of the upstream portion of the patient
ci
rcuit (8).
Unit according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the container (3) is made

of transparent rigid plastic or glass.
