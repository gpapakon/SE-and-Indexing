<ABSTRACT>
A fluid motor with oscillating piston is proposed, which motor has a housing (1), containing a piston chamber (5) in which an oscillating piston (6) is situated. The oscillating piston (6) has at least two oscillating vanes (25, 26) spaced at an interval from one another in the oscillating direction (18), each of which is arranged in a common piston chamber (5) between two subchambers (33, 34; 33', 34'), the subchambers (34, 33'; 34', 33), each immediately succeeding one another in the oscillating direction (18), of two oscillating vanes (25, 26) succeeding one another in the oscillating direction (18), being separated from one another by a wall (36, 37) fixed to the housing. In this way, with a corresponding supply of pressure medium, an increased torque is obtained compared to a single-vane oscillating piston (6) for comparable overall dimensions.
