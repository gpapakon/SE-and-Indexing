<ABSTRACT>
The proposal of the invention is that a container for paints be so designed that it can be emptied of residues more easily, reliably and completely than is the case with conventional containers. The containers to which the invention refers are those for paints, surface coatings or other viscous contents. In order to achieve this objective, the invention envisages a base (1) which is connected to a container wall (10), which is closed (at the top) by a removable lid (11). The base (1) has a defined region (2) which is lowered in comparison with the remaining base region (residual base) towards the median axis of the container wall (10). The lowered region has at least one removal aperture (4; 4a, 4b, 4c), which is closed in the filled state of the container. It can however easily be opened, especially when the container has been emptied by use. In conjunction with this proposal, an apparatus is also shown whereby a base (1) can be produced which permits (virtually) complete emptying of a paint container. A method is also described whereby a container for viscous contents can be completely or virtually completely emptied of residues.
