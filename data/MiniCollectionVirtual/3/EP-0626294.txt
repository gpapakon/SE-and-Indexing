<ABSTRACT>
Roof rack for vehicles having two roof strips (3) which respectively have an upper supporting surface (5) and an inner channel (6) which is open facing the outside of the strip (3), the channel aperture being formed by inwardly arranged flanges (7) in an engagement wall of the roof strips (3), and being mounted respectively via supporting feet (2) by means of two transverse rods (1) which are adjustably fixed to the roof strips (3) and with fastening devices which are respectively composed of a clamping plate (8) which is arranged in the channel (6) and of a screw (9) which is screwed thereto. Provision is made for holes (10) extending parallel to the channel (6) at a distance from one another in a row and one behind the other to be formed in the roof strips (3) and for each supporting foot (2) to support a securing pin (11) which extends axially parallel to the threaded shaft and can be respectively inserted into one of the holes (10).

<CLAIMS>
A roof rack for vehicles with two stationary roof 
Strips (3), which are at least approximately 

parallel to each other and are fixed along the 
lateral edges of the roof surface, each strip being 

provided with an upper supporting surface (5) and 
an elongated internal passage (6), which opens 

towards the exterior of the strip (3), the opening 
of the passage being formed by internally directed 

flanges (7) in an insertion wall of the roof strips 
(3), with a front and rear adjustable transverse 

bar (1), which is mounted on the roof strips (3), 
and which is movable on the supporting surface (5) 

of the roof Strips (3) by means of support feet 
(2), and with fixing means for fixing the support 

feet (2) on the strips (3), each fixing means 
including a clamping plate (8) disposed inside the 

passage (6) and a cylindrical headed screw (9), 
whose threaded stem which extends through the 

passage opening is in threaded engagement with the 
clamping plate (8), 
characterized in that
 in the 
strips (3) are formed a plurality of successive 

holes (10) which are lined up in parallel with 
respect to the passage (6) at a certain distance  

 
from each other and in that each support foot (2) 

supports a locking pin (11) whose axis is parallel 
to the axis of the threaded stem and which is 

insertable in a respective one of the holes (10), 
wherein moreover th
e locking pin (11) is disposed 
on one end on a plate (12) which lies on the 

support foot (2), and the pin passes with its free 
end through the narrow section of a stepped hole 

(13), which is formed in the support foot (2), in 
that the plate (12) is fixed on the support foot 

(2) by means of the head of the cylindrical screw 
(9) which is in engagement with the clamping plate 

(8), the plate (12) being movable towards the 
support foot (2) against the force of a spiral 

pressure spring (14) which is supported on one end 
on the annular face of the stepped hole (13) and 

surrounds the locking pin (11) and the cylindrical 
head screw (9) supporting an abutment disc (15) 

which prevents an extraction from the support foot 
(2).
