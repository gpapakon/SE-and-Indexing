<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a baseband predistortion system for the 
adaptive linearization of power amplifiers and to a 

radiotransmitter using the predistortion system. 
It is based upon the updating of two error tables, one for the 
amplitude and one for the phase, whose content is used for 

correcting the baseband samples. 
The content of said tables is obtained by accumulating the 
difference, suitably weighed, between the sampling entering the 

predistortion device and the demodulated feedback value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a baseband predistortion system
for the adaptive linearization of power amplifiers and to a radio
transmitter making use of the predistortion system.In the past, mobile communication theory and practice have
emphasized constant-envelope modulation schemes such as FM or CPM
(Continuous Phase Modulation) in order to allow power amplifiers
to work in the nonlinear operating zone near saturation. This
permits the efficiency to be increased and do not generate
intermodulation products in the adjacent channels.At present, the main problem is determined by the limited portion
of available spectrum and therefore other types of modulation
spectrally more effective have been taken into account, like e.g.
n-QPSK and, more in general, n-QAM with baseband filtering.Unfortunately these methods do not feature a constant envelope
and the operating point of the RF power amplifier must be chosen
with care to avoid disturbances on the spectrum due to
intermodulation products; on the other hand, making an amplifier
to work in the linear zone (class A) leads to a significant
decrease in the efficiency and therefore suitable linearization
techniques are to be adopted.The idea of solving the distortion problem, caused by power
amplifiers, through adaptive baseband-operated linearizing
devices is not new.In particular, the article "Adaptive Linearization using 
Predistortion" by M. Faulkner, T. Mattson and W. Yates IEEE CH
2846-4/90 pages 35 to 40 describes a predistortion device based
upon the updating of error tables, whose content is used for
correcting the baseband samples. In this case an access mode to
such tables is used which is directly proportional, in a uniform
manner, to the amplitude of the input signal and to the distorted
signal of the amplifier.
The main drawbacks encountered with this type of predistortion
device, and also with others already known, are caused by slow
convergence, inaccurate calculations, long processing times and
loop instability phenomena. GB 2,239,770 teaches a modulation device with input signal modification for correction of
amplifier nonlinearity. The modulation device has a first arithmetic circuit for calculating an
amplitude Ai and a phase i of a complex signal from sampled input signals I and Q. The amplitude
Ai is used to address a ROM which provides amplitude compensation signals Ai' and phase
compensation signals i'. Anyway it does not teach or suggest a base band predistorter system
having an adaptive predistortion circuit with an address
