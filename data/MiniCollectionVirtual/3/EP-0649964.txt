attached to the jamb bracket. A channel assembly (22) 
having a longitudinally extending channel (23) is attached 

to the door and a mechanism for holding the door is 
positioned within the channel assembly, the door holding 

mechanism having a slide assembly (26) with a slot (30) 
defined therein for engagement with rollers (42). An 

adjustment assembly (50) for varying force on the rollers 
for engagement with the slot of the slide assembly includes 

a primary wedge (52) connected to a wedge adjust screw 
(56), with the primary wedge being configured for

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adjustable overhead door 
holder assembly and more particularly to an overhead door 
holder assembly having a low profile suitable for mounting 
in a door top inset, that can be easily adjusted without 
removal of a hold open stop. Temporarily holding a door in an open position is often 
necessary for convenience and safety. One commonly 
employed method uses an overhead door control device that 
includes a pivoting arm attached between an upper portion 
of a door jamb and an upper part of a door. When the door 
is to be held open at an angle that does not exceed about 
110 degrees, an overhead door control device is efficient, 
effective and convenient to install and maintain. Overhead 
door control devices are less subject to damage by 
vandalism or accidents and do not present a potential 
stumbling hazard. However, many conventional overhead door control devices 
are difficult to mount properly in an inset door top 
because of their thickness. Since time consuming or 
expensive modifications to the door are required to 
properly fit the door holder, door holders necessary for 
convenience or safety may be omitted. Alternatively, 
marginal performance conventional low profile door holders 
may be attached, leading to dissatisfaction and high 
maintenance and replacement costs. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided an overhead adjustable door holder assembly for 
attachment between a door jamb and a door, for selectively 
holding the door in an open position; comprising a jamb 
bracket for attachment to the door jamb; a jamb arm  
 
pivotally attached to the jamb bracket; a channel assembly 
having a channel therein defined by channel walls; a slide 
assembly positioned for movement in the channel, said slide 
assembly being pivotally attached to the jamb arm; and a 
hold open assembly attached to the channel assembly: 
characterised in that said hold open assembly has a roller 
link with connected rollers for engaging the slide assembly 
to hold the door in an open position, and a movable rod for 
modifying position of the roller link to allow for 
engagement/disengagement with the slide assembly and there 
being an adjustment assembly for varying force of a spring 
on the movable rod, the adjustment assembly having primary 
and secondary wedges positioned between the roller link and 
the movable rod. According to a second aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided an overhead adjustable door holder 
assembly for attachment between

<CLAIMS>
An overhead adjustable door holder assembly (10) for 
attachment between a door jamb (14) and a door (13), for 

selectively holding the door in an open position; 
comprising a jamb bracket (16) for attachment to the door 

jamb (14); a jamb arm (18) pivotally attached to the jamb 
bracket (16); a channel assembly (22) having a channel (23) 

therein defined by channel walls; a slide assembly (26) 
positioned for movement in the channel (23), said slide 

assembly being pivotally attached to the jamb arm (18); and 
a hold open assembly (36) attached to the channel assembly; 

characterised in that said hold open assembly (36) has a 
roller link (40) with connected rollers (42) for engaging 

the slide assembly to hold the door in an open position, 
and a movable rod (46) for modifying position of the roller 

link (40) to allow for engagement/disengagement with the 
slide assembly and there being an adjustment assembly (50) 

for varying force of a spring (48) on the movable rod, the 
adjustment assembly having primary and secondary wedges 

(52, 54) positioned between the roller link (40) and the 

movable rod (46). 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the primary 
and secondary wedges are configured slidably to engage each 

other. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
secondary wedge (54) is connected to a bracket (38) of the 

hold open assembly (36) and the primary wedge (52) is 
connected to a wedge adjust screw (56) capable of vertical 

adjustment to change the spatial relationship between the 
primary and secondary wedges, increasing or decreasing a 

horizontal distance across the combined primary and 
secondary wedges and moving the roller link (40) to alter 

 
the position of the rollers for engaging the slide 

assembly. 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the 
slide assembly (26) has a first ramp (28) for engaging the 

rollers (42) as the slide assembly advances toward the hold 
open assembly (36), and the slide assembly further defines 

a slot (30) to accommodate the rollers and hold the door in
