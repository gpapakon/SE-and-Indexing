<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit arrangement for a demodulator of a radio data signal in a broadcast receiver, the multiplex signal in digital form, after band pass filtering, is mixed into the base band with a reference carrier obtained from a sampling clock generated in the broadcast receiver at two phase angles shifted with respect to one another by 90@, a first and a second mixed signal being produced. A first and a second auxiliary signal are generated with a sinusoidal and a cosinusoidal variation. The first mixed signal is multiplied by the first auxiliary signal and the second mixed signal is multiplied by the second auxiliary signal, the results of these multiplications being added, forming a first output signal. The first mixed signal is multiplied by the second auxiliary signal and the second mixed signal is multiplied by the first auxiliary signal, the results being subtracted, forming a second output signal. The phase angle of the auxiliary signals is controlled in such a manner that the first output signal corresponds to the radio data signal converted down into the base band.
