<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the process and
apparatus for the production of encapsulated chemical foaming
concentrates which includes the compounding of chemical
foaming agents in a resin carrier and pelletizing the
concentrate under water at such conditions that the chemical
foaming agent is encapsulated. These uniquely encapsulated
and pelletized chemical foaming concentrates are used for
foaming thermoplastics. More specifically, one embodiment of
the present invention is the encapsulating of an endothermic
foaming agent such as citric acid and sodium bicarbonate in
a resin carrier which when incorporated into a thermoplastic
polymer to be foamed will react to form carbon dioxide as the
active foaming gas. Another embodiment of the present
invention is the encapsulating of an exothermic foaming agent
such as an azo compound or a hydride in a resin carrier which
when incorporated into a thermoplastic polymer to be foamed
will react to form nitrogen or hydrogen respectively as the
active foaming gas. Still another embodiment of the present
invention is the encapsulating of an endothermic foaming
agent with an exothermic foaming agent at levels from 10/90
to 90/10 wt % to obtain a hybrid foaming agent concentrate
exhibiting the best properties of each foaming agent system.Foaming of thermoplastics in the majority of
applications is now accomplished with exothermic foaming
agents, usually azo compounds, which when admixed with the
desired thermoplastic polymer in an extruder or molding
machine are heated above their decomposition temperatures,
and produces nitrogen which forms the cell structure in the
molded or extruded part. However, in the compounding and
producing of concentrates of these exothermic foaming 
materials the chemical reaction of the foaming agents is not
suppressed in any of the current processes employed.
Approaches vary, one is compounding the exothermic foaming
agents in a very low melting material so that when mixing the
foaming agent with the material the decomposition temperature
is not reached; however, the low melting material may not be
fully compatible with the desired thermoplastic polymer used
to produce a foamed part or product. Another approach is to
attempt to produce the concentrate at maximum flow rates or
minimum residence times in the extruder. However, the
conditions heretofore used are often contrary to controlling
the decomposition of the foaming agent and the foaming agent
reacts, releasing the gas and the pellets containing the
foaming agent are already
