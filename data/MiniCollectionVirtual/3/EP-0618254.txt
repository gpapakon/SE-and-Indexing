<ABSTRACT>
A plastic material with a paint film is coarse-crushed, 
and a film decomposition agent, e.g. a heterocyclic compound 

such as imidazole, a triazine compound such as 
benzoguanamine, a phenylendiamine compound such as N-phenyl-N'-isopropyl-p-phenylene 

diamine, is added to the coarse-crushed 
material. The mixture is then heated and kneaded to 

dissolve the paint film and uniformly spread the particles of 
the paint film in the plastic material. The physical 

properties and surface quality of the plastic material are 
substantially the same as those of the original material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for recycling
plastic products or plastic waste articles with painted
surfaces.In recent years, plastic products are often used for
automobile parts. For example, when plastic bumpers with
unpainted surfaces are recycled, defectively molded bumpers
and the bumpers recovered from scrapped vehicles are coarse-crushed
to a size about 3 mm cube, which are then mixed with
a virgin or new material and reused to mold bumpers. This is
possible because the physical properties of recycled plastic
materials are not substantially degraded.However, in the bumpers with painted surfaces, plastic
materials recovered in the same manner can not be reused for
bumpers. This is because, when the painted bumpers are
crushed, paint films are mixed in the recycled plastic
materials, so that the physical properties of the plastic
materials, such as impact resistance, elongation and surface
quality substantially degrade, resulting in a failure to
satisfy the performance required as a bumper.Therefore, the painted plastic bumpers which are
defectively molded or those recovered from scrapped vehicles
are buried in the ground or burned to thereby cause
environmental disruption. Some, however, are recycled for 
construction piles, in which requirements regarding physical
properties are not so strict.Japanese Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 3-23909 proposes
a method for separating and recovering polyurethane and
polyvinyl chloride from waste in which these compounds are
laminated. In this method, the above waste composite
materials are coarse-crushed to 20 to 50 mm masses, and are
then pulverized by agitation in an agitator. In order to
recover polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane with a particle size
of 1 to 2 mm is separated by a sieve from sheet-like
polyvinyl chloride with an overall size of 30 mm.Currently, for recycling the plastic bumpers with
painted surfaces, techniques are being developed to separate
the plastic portions from the paint film portions and to
recover only the plastic portions for recycling. The
following three major techniques are generally used:
(1) Method for removing the paint film by blasting
Abrasive materials are blown with compressed air against
the paint film of the painted plastic bumper to mechanically
remove the film.(2) Method for melting resin and separating the paint
film with a screen
A painted plastic bumper is coarse-crushed and fed into
an extruder where the plastic part is melted. Since the
paint film does not melt in the extruder due to its
thermosetting

<CLAIMS>
A method of recycling painted plastic articles comprising,

coarse-crushing the plastic articles having a paint film on a surface thereof,
supplying a paint film decomposition agent to the coarse-crushed plastic articles,

characterised in that said coarse-crushed plastic articles are heated and kneaded with the film
decomposition agent to dissolve the paint film and uniformly spread particles of the paint film in

the plastic articles, and in the that said film decomposition agent is:

(a) a heterocyclic compound selected from 2-mercaptoimidazoline, benzotriazole, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.
2-methylimidazole, N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide and

imidazole;
(b) a triazine compound selected from 2-di-n-butylamino-4, 6-dimercapto-s-triazine,
benzoguanamine, isomelamine, acetoguanamine,

2,4,6-trimercapto-s-triazine, isocyanuric acid and isocyanuric
acid ester; or
(c) a phenylenediamine compound selected from N-phenyl-N'-isopropyl-p-phenylenediamine.
N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, N-phenyl-N'-1,3-dimethylbutyl-p-phenylenediamine,

N,N'-di-beta-naphthyl-p-phenylenediamine and N,N'-diaryl-p-phenylenediamine.
A method according to Claim 1, further comprising moulding the plastic articles
containing the particles of the paint film for reuse.
A method according to Claim 2, further comprising adding new plastic articles to said
coarse-crushed plastic articles with the paint film to provide a mixture thereof.
A method according to Claim 3, wherein said plastic articles are crushed to have a cubic
shape with a size of 1-10mm in one length.
A method according to any of the preceding Claims wherein the step of heating and
kneading the coarse-crushed plastic articles with the paint film decomposition agent is performed

at a temperature of at least 180Â°C.
