<ABSTRACT>
A temperature probe (10) measures the temperature of a fluid which moves relative to the probe (10). The probe (10) includes a housing (14), a transducer (30), and one or more fins (28). The housing (14) has a bore (16) with a bore axis (18) and carries at least a portion of the fluid along the bore axis (18). The transducer (30) has a sensing length, and the fin (28) thermally couples to the transducer (30) along substantially the entire sensing length. The fin (28) is also substantially aligned with the bore axis (18) to promote laminar flow of the fluid in the bore (16). In a preferred embodiment the transducer (30) is held within a protective tube (32), and the fin (28) attaches to the tube (32) along a fin inner edge. The fin also attaches along a fin outer edge to a radiation shield (34) encircling the tube (32), the fin outer edge being shorter than the fin inner edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to temperature probes, and
in particular to those temperature probes which
measure the temperature of a fluid moving relative to
the probe.Arno et al. disclose, in U.S. Patent No.
5,062,571, a temperature sensing control for a
refrigeration system. Specifically, Arno et al. teach
a temperature sensor housed within a central portion
of finned member. Fins have their outer edges in firm
heat-conducting engagement with inside portion of
conduit through which the cooled air leaving shell
evaporator passes.In the present invention being defined by claim 1, a temperature probe includes one or more
fins thermally coupled to a transducer along substantially a full sensing length
of the transducer. The fin or fins are disposed to enhance convective heat
transfer between the transducer and a fluid moving relative to the probe, and
to promote laminar flow of the fluid. The probe further includes a housing
having a bore with a bore axis, the housing carrying at least a portion of the
fluid along the bore axis. The fins are disposed in the bore, and in a
preferred embodiment attach to a tube in which the transducer is located.
The fins enhance the convective heat transfer by increasing an effective
surface area-to-mass of the transducer, thereby quickening a response time of
the transducer to a transient flow condition. In a preferred embodiment, the
fin attaches to the tube along a fin inner edge and has a trailing fin edge
which tapers at an acute angle to the fin inner edge.FIG. 1 is a side elevational view partly broken away and sectioned of
a temperature probe in accordance with the invention; FIG. 2 is a perspective view partly broken away of a temperature
probe subassembly taken from FIG. 1;FIG. 3 is a side elevational view partly broken away and sectioned of
a portion of an alternate embodiment of a temperature probe subassembly in
accordance with the invention;FIG. 4 is an end view taken along line 4-4 of FIG. 2;FIG. 5 is an end view taken along line 5-5 of FIG. 3; andFIG. 6 is a view of an alternate embodiment of the temperature probe 
of FIG. 1.In FIG. 1, temperature probe 10 measures the temperature of a fluid
shown generally at 12. Preferably, probe 10 mounts on an air vehicle and
measures total air temperature. Probe 10 includes a housing 14, which has a
bore 16 of a generally cylindrical shape and aligned along a bore axis 18,18.
The fluid enters opening 20 in housing 14, and at least a portion of the fluid
generally follows arrow 22 into bore 16. Another portion of the fluid,
