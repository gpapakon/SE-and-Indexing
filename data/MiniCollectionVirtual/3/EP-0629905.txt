<ABSTRACT>
An image printer includes a developing unit (D) for 
developing a photosensitive material (2), a transport 

device (T) for transporting the photosensitive material 
(2) through an exposing position to the developing unit (D), 

an image exposure unit (P) for exposing the photosensitive 
material with image information at the exposing 

position with dividing the image information into a 
plurality of lines extending perpendicular to a 

transporting direction of the photosensitive material (2). 
The printer further includes a measuring device (M) for 

measuring intensity of light irradiated from a light 
irradiating end (14) of the image exposure unit with 

respect to the photosensitive material and a 
correcting device for correcting the exposure amount 

based on measurement data of the measuring device (M).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
printer, and more particularly to an image printer
including transport means for transporting a
photosensitive material through an exposing position
to a developing unit and image exposure means for
exposing the photosensitive material with image
information at the exposing position with dividing the
image information into a plurality of lines extending
perpendicular to a transporting direction of the
photosensitive material.According to an image printer of the above-described
type, the image exposure means exposes the
image information on to the photosensitive material
which has been transported to the exposing position by
the transport means. Then, the transport means
further transports this exposed photosensitive 
material from the exposing position to the developing
unit, by which the photosensitive material is
developed.When the image exposure means exposes the image
information on to the photosensitive material, this
exposure is effected with setting an exposure amount
for each of the areas of the image information.
Accordingly, for proper exposure of the photosensitive
material, the set exposure amount and the actual
exposure amount need to correspond to each other.For this reason, according to the convention, an
actual exposure amount is measured at the time of
shipping of the image printer so as to cause the set
exposure amount to correspond to the actual exposure
amount of the photosensitive material.However, even with the above adjustment at the
time of shipping, the set exposure amount and the
actual exposure amount of the photosensitive material
become different from each other due to a secular or
aging change in e.g. the irradiation light intensity
of the exposure light source. In such case, the
irradiation light intensity of the exposure light
source is adjusted to equate with its initial value at
the time of shipping.Accordingly, although the actual exposure amount 
of the image exposure means is adjusted at the time of
shipping of the printer, the convention only provides
the adjustment of the irradiation light intensity of
the exposure light source as means to cope with the
problem of the aging change. Thus, the convention has
been unable to fully cope with any other type of aging
change such as in the light transmission
characteristics of the optical components disposed in
the light path extending to the light irradiating end
of the image exposure means. The invention solves this object by providing an image printer according to
claim 1. EP 0
