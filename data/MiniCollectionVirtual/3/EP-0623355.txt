<ABSTRACT>
A medical tissue drainage device comprises a solid needle which is connected at its front end to a ground piece penetrating the tissue and at its rear end to a drainage tube to be positioned in the tissue. A connection element is arranged between the needle and the drainage tube. The connection element can be releasably fastened to the needle. A screw device is arranged between the connection element and the needle. The screw device comprises a single or multiple external and internal thread. At its rear end the needle may comprise an axially projecting peg provided with an external thread and screwable into an axial recess in the connection element provided with a corresponding internal thread, or an axial bore provided with an internal thread and into which a peg which projects axially beyond a front end of the connection element and has a corresponding external thread can be screwed. The connection element can be pressed against an opposite sealing surface of the needle by a sealing surface annularly surrounding the recess and the peg. The peg has a foot having an outside diameter which is smaller than the inside diameter of the external thread.

<CLAIMS>
Medical tissue drainage device with a solid needle (2), which is provided with a cutting tip (82) penetrating the tissue at its front end and is connected at its rear end (8) to a drainage tube (4) to be positioned in the tissue, and the needle (2) has a cutting tip (82) as a cannula cutter (84), 
characterised in that
 a separate connecting element (6) is disposed between the needle (2) and the drainage tube, which connecting element (6) can be releasably connected to the needle (2) by means of a screw connection at one end, and the connecting piece (6) can be inserted in a drainage tube (4) so that it can not be detached or is difficult to detach at the other end, and the screw connection can be screwed by means of an axially protruding pin (34) provided with an external thread (32) into a matching internal thread (29) of an axial recess (28) of the connecting element (6) or rear end (8) of the needle (2).
Tissue drainage device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the connecting element (6) can be pressed by means of a seal surface (40) surrounding the recess (28) or pin (34) in an annular shape against an oppositely lying seal surface (44, 46) of the needle (2).
Tissue drainage device as claimed in one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the pin (22, 34) has a base (38) with an external diameter smaller than the internal diameter of the external thread (24, 32).
Tissue drainage device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 a connection point (51) is provided between the connecting element (6) and the drainage tube (4), in the region of which the connecting element (6) has an external wall (7) with an external diameter at least equal in size to an external wall (53) bounding the drainage tube (4).
