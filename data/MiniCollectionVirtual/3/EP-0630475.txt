<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing a blood fluid sample substantially free from red blood cells (RBCs) is disclosed. The method involves applying whole blood to a solid support matrix which contains reagent such as antibodies or their immunologically reactive fragments that are directed against RBCs or their components. The invention further comprises a method and device for the testing of analytes in blood. Whole blood is applied to the device, which then separates the RBCs from the plasma. The device further contains zones and and reagents for analysis of the plasma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to immunological and
related assay methods and apparatus, especially those
used in blood testing.The literature on various forms of diagnostic
test methods including specific binding assays,
especially immunoassays, is extensive and commercial
products are numerous. A large number of simplified and
conveniently packaged assays are currently available.
Nonetheless, there remains a need for assay devices which
are easy to use and interpret.Whole blood samples may obscure the reading of
test results due to turbidity and color. In order to
solve this problem, previous investigators have described
devices which both separate out the Red Blood Cells
(RBCs) and analyze the resultant plasma or serum for a
particular dissolved component. EPO Publication No.
287731 to Maddox describes a dry test device comprising
an absorbent reagent zone containing a chemical assay or
immunoassay and an analyte target having a polysaccharide
material that can limit the passage of RBCs or hold the
RBCs on or near the surface of the absorbent reagent
zone. A one-step procedure, employing simultaneous
separation from whole blood with testing for a desired
component is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,678,757 to
Rapkin et al. Blood is applied to the surface of a 
carbohydrate-treated carrier. The fluid portion migrates
away from the point of contact and the cellular
components remain in close proximity to the point of
contact. If the carrier is further treated with a
reagent employed to detect a component, a color will
appear in the fluid. U.S. Patent No. 3,552,928 to Fetter
describes a means for separation of whole blood into a
colorless fluid and a red cell or residue component. The
whole blood is contacted with a separative reagent (a
water-soluble, nonvolatile amino acid), the residue is
removed and the remaining fluid can be contacted with a
test reagent. Both reagents may be contained on a single
matrix (i.e. bibulous filter paper), however, the matrix
must allow the colorless fluid to flow from the
separating reagent to the test reagent. U.S. Patent
4,594,327 to Zuk describes a procedure whereby blood is
first treated with a red blood cell precipitant, such as
an antibody, lectin or certain polymeric amino acids, and
then passed into an "immunochromatograph." The red blood
cells remain at the liquid/air interface.U.S. Patent 4,943,522 to Eisinger et al.
describes methods and apparatus for conducting specific
binding pair assays, such as immunoassays. A porous
membrane capable of non-bibulous lateral flow
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A lateral flow device for detection of the presence, absence, or amount of
an analyte in a whole blood sample, which device comprises in a generally planar format:


i) a sample receiving zone (23) comprising a first solid porous matrix with an
immobilized reagent that specifically binds red blood cell surface antigens

and effects the removal of substantially all red blood cells (RBCs) from the whole blood
sample to result in a substantially RBC-free fluid containing dissolved or dispersed

components, said sample receiving zone being in nonbibulous lateral flow contact with
ii) a labeling zone (26) comprising a second solid porous matrix with a
mobilizable labeling component comprising a visible label coupled to a moiety capable of

specifically binding to the analyte or of competing with the analyte for an immobilized
capture reagent that specifically binds to the labeled analyte or to the labeling component

competing with the analyte, said labeling zone being in nonbibulous lateral flow contact
with
iii) a capture zone (29) comprising a third solid porous matrix with an immobilized
capture reagent which specifically binds labelled analyte or the labeling component that

competes with analyte, said capture zone being in nonbibulous lateral flow contact with
iv) an absorbent zone (31);

wherein said sample receiving zone is separately prepared and positioned
contiguous with the remainder of the device prior to application of the sample; and

wherein all of said dissolved or dispersed components in said RBC-free fluid flow
through the sample receiving zone, labeling zone and capture zone in a non-bibulous

flow.
The device of claim 1 wherein said labeling component is capable of
specifically binding to the analyte and wherein the labeling component comprises a

visible label coupled to a specific binding partner for said analyte. 
The device of claim 1 wherein said labeling component is capable of
specifically competing with the labelled analyte for the immobilized capture reagent and wherein

the labeling component comprises a visible label coupled to a competitor of said analyte
for said immobilized capture reagent.
The device of claim 1 wherein the reagent that specifically binds red blood
cell surface antigens is selected from the group consisting of monoclonal antibody,

polyclonal antibodies, and their F(ab')
2
, Fab' and Fab fragments.
The device of claim 1 in which at least one of said first solid porous
matrix, second solid porous matrix and third solid porous matrix comprise a

non-woven fabric structure.
The device of claim 5 wherein said fabric has a spunlaced structure.
The device of claim 1 wherein at least one of said first solid porous matrix,
second solid porous matrix and third solid porous matrix further each are comprised of a

high density polyethylene sheet.
The device of claim 7, wherein said sheet has an open pore structure with
a density, at 40% void volume, of 0.57 gm/cc and an average pore diameter of 1 to 250

micrometers.
The device of claim 1 wherein said zones have a pore size of about 1-100
micrometers. 
A method to determine the presence, absence, or amount of analyte in a
whole blood sample which method comprises the steps of:


(a) contacting the whole blood sample with the device of claim 1; and
(b) visually observing the binding of the label as a function of the presence or
absence or amount of the analyte in the whole blood sample.
