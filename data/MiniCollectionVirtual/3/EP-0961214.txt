<ABSTRACT>
A method of processing customer image orders, each of at least one
image capturing an original scene. An image content identification in the form of

an image content identification signal, is generated based on an identification of
one or more scene objects, for at least one image of a customer order. The

generated image content identification is compared with different image content
identifications stored in a memory in association with respective predetermined

customer certificate data. When at least a generated image content identification
matches a stored image content identification, generating a customer certificate

from the stored certificate data associated with the matching stored image content
identification. The method can be used with customer image sets which may not

be image orders. An apparatus and computer program product which can execute
such a method, are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of photography, and in
particular to processing of images.In typical photofinishing operations a user (sometimes referenced
as a customer), delivers one or more film rolls carrying corresponding exposed
films, to a processing laboratory to have them chemically developed and
hardcopies of the images (such as paper prints or slides) prepared. The user can
include an individual or a retail store. Individual films are often spliced together
end to end to form a larger roll which is easily handled by automated equipment.
Following chemical processing of the roll to yield permanent images from the
latent images on the films, each image is scanned at high speed to obtain image
characteristics, such as color and density. These characteristics are passed to an
optical printer which uses the characteristic data to adjust exposure conditions
(such as exposure time, color balance, and the like) of an image frame on the
developed film which is optically projected onto a photosensitive paper. The
exposed photosensitive paper is then chemically developed to yield the final
hardcopy prints. In modern photofinishing operations, images may optionally also
be scanned to provide an image signal corresponding to each image on the film.
These image signals are usually stored on a medium such as a magnetic or optical
disk and provided to the customer, or made available to the customer over the
Internet, and may be used then or at a later time to provide a hardcopy output.
When the customer order is completed, each film is cut into strips (for 35mm film)
or reattached to a film cassette (for Advanced Photo System films), the exposed
paper (when prints are made) is cut into individual prints, and the film, completed
prints and any other media (such as a disk bearing scanned images, or mounted
slides) are packaged at a finishing station and the order is then complete. Recently
it has been described that in the foregoing type of photofinishing operation, the
optical printer can be replaced with a digital printer which will print the images 
directly from the scanned data, following enhancements or other manipulations to
the scanned images.There is a high degree of interest among photographers in using the
images returned from a photofinisher in a multitude of products, other than in
typical prints or slides. For example, it is known to provide a service whereby a
photographer can provide a particular image to a service operator, who will scan
the image and print it on T-shirts, cups,
