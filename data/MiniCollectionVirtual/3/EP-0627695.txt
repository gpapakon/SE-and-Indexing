<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for recognising structural changes, grouped to form clusters, in medical diagnostics using an appropriate picture. The particular field of application of the invention is in this case the recognition of point microcalcifications in mammography. In this case, the method uses as the picture a picture present in digital form, as well as an electronic image-processing method. The first step in this case is to check the individual pixels to ascertai0n whether they can be suspected of a structural change. The pixels suspected of being structural changes are then combined to form clusters. Finally, the clusters thus formed are checked with regard to cluster-specific criteria.
