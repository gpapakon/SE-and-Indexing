<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide simple moisture sealing for a motor-pump set having a motor housing (1), on the one hand, which is arranged axially in front of a pump housing (2) and having an electronic housing (3), on the other hand, which is arranged behind said pump housing (2), both the motor housing (1) and the electronics housing (3) making contact by means of their respective end surfaces, the connecting conductors (6.1; 6.2) between a brush plate (1.2) in the motor housing (1) and a printed circuit board (3.1) in the electronics housing (3) are not laid externally over the pump housing (2) but via bushings in the end surfaces, which rest against one another and are sealed with respect to one another by means of radially externally circumferential seals (9; 9), within the motor housing (1), as well as the pump housing (2).

<CLAIMS>
Motor-pump unit, preferably a motor-vehicle
anti-lock brake device, comprising, in an axial series

arrangement, a motor housing (1), a pump housing (2) and
an electronics housing (3) with the following features:


a) the motor housing (1) lies with its one end surface
tightly fitting in front of one end surface of the

pump housing (2);
b) the electronics housing (3) lies with its one end
surface tightly fitting in front of the other end

surface of the pump housing (2);
c) the end surfaces, which lie tightly fitting one in
front of the other, are sealed off from one

another, preferably radially outwards, by
interposed peripheral seals (9; 9);
d) connecting lines (6.1; 6.2) pass through bushings
in the end surfaces, which lie tightly fitting one

in front of the other - with leadthroughs from the
circumferential surface of the motor housing (1)

and reinsertions into the electronics housing (3)
from the outer circumference through the pump

housing (2) being omitted -, as electrical supply
and control lines between the interior of the motor

housing (1), on the one hand, and the interior of
the electronics housing (3), on the other;
e) the electrical connecting lines (6.1; 6.2) run
radially within the peripheral seals (9; 9) through

the end surfaces, which lie tightly fitting one in 
front of the other, of the motor housing (1) and of

the pump housing (2), as well as of the pump
housing (2) and of the electronics housing (3).
Motor-pump unit according to Claim 1 having the
following feature:

f) the electrical connecting lines (6.1; 6.2) are
laid, preferably injection-moulded, within the

motor housing (1) in axial spacers (6) which are
fixed between tangentially opposite end sides of

magnetic shells (4) held on the inner circumference
of the motor housing (1).
Motor-pump unit according to Claim 2 with the
following feature:

g) at least the spacers (6) which receive the connecting
lines (6.1; 6.2) are extended or designed as a

plug-type connector which passes through the pump
housing (2) and can be contacted in the electronics

housing (3) with an electrical or electronic supply
device.
Motor-pump unit according to one of Claims 1-3
with the following feature:

h) the connecting lines (6.1; 6.2) connect a brush
plate (1.2) in the motor housing (1), on the one

hand, to a circuit board (3.1) in the electronics
housing (3) on the other.
