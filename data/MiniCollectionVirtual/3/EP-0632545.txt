<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for electrically interconnecting a lead of an 
integrated circuit device (5) to a terminal (3) spaced at a distance from 

the lead, such as on a printed circuit board (4). The apparatus is 
also useful for interconnecting two printed circuit boards. The 

apparatus includes a housing (8) which has at least two flanges (7) 
extending therefrom. The flanges (7) are spaced a distance with an 

elastomeric element (2) captured thereby and extending therebetween. 
A conductive contact (1) is mounted on the elastomeric element (2) and thus 

freely suspended for contact with terminals to be interconnected. 
A multiplicity of such contacts (1) may be arranged in a suitable 

pattern for interconnecting specified integrated circuit devices 
with a printed circuit board. The contact shape can be generally 

disk-like to provide maximum wiping action and to facilitate airtight 
contact between the terminal and interconnect apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals broadly with the field of devices
for interconnecting electrical contacts. More narrowly, however,
the invention is related to technology for inter-connecting a
plurality of corresponding terminals by means of an electrical
conductor between an integrated circuit device and a printed
circuit board or between two printed circuit boards. The device is
particularly useful for interfacing an integrated circuit with a
tester, including a printed circuit board, during the manufacturing
process to assure operativeness. The preferred embodiment of the
invention is directed to contact design and means for mounting the
contacts for effecting interconnection between devices.Devices and methods for effecting electrical interconnection
between two conductors are generally known. A specialized area of
such interconnection has been recently expanding with the advent of
integrated circuit technology. The chip of the integrated circuit
must be electrically interconnected with the overall device by some
means in order to effect interfacing between the integrated circuit
and the overall device.In the manufacturing process for making integrated circuit
devices, each integrated circuit must be tested for operativeness.
Thus, another application for electrical interconnection of an
integrated circuit device is with a tester apparatus. To assure
proper testing, the electrical interface must be of high
reliability so that tested integrated circuits are not falsely 
found defective due to a poor electrical interconnection rather
than to actual defectiveness in the integrated circuit. Testing
apparatus which connect an integrated circuit device with a printed
circuit board are generally referred to as a device under test
(DUT) boards.Several technologies for packaging a semi-conductor chip into
an integrated circuit device have developed. These may be
generally categorized as pin grid array (PGA) systems and leaded
semi-conductor devices. The leaded semi-conductor devices include
plastic leaded chip carriers (PLCC), dual in-line packages (DIP)
and Quad Flat Pack (QFP). Each packaging type requires a
particular array of contacts to be interconnected with a printed
circuit board.A further specialized area of interconnecting electrical
contacts focuses on the interconnection of two printed circuit
boards. These interconnections have applications utilizing
insertable boards, such as memory cards, or multi-chip boards which
are highly miniaturized and integrated.All of the electrical interconnect
