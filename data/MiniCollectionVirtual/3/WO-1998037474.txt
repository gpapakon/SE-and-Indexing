<ABSTRACT>
A natural language-based information organization and collaboration tool for a computer system is disclosed. The present invention includes an apparatus and method for processing text expressions in a computer system, the apparatus including: 1) an object database defining an information object with an associated keyword; 2) a user input device for receiving an input text expression; 3) a parsing device for identifying the keyword in the input text expression, the parsing device including functions for linking the input text expression to the information object based on the keyword identified in the input text expression; and 4) a user output device for displaying to the user the identity of the information object to which the input text expression was linked. The apparatus of the present invention further includes supplemental information in the object database which is related to the information object, the user output device further including functions for displaying the supplemental information when a corresponding keyword is identified in the input text expression. The apparatus of the present invention further includes a method and apparatus for collaboration between users of a time and project management system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AN INFORMATION ORGANIZATION AND COLLABORATIONTOOL FOR PROCESSING NOTES AND ACTION REQUESTSIN COMPUTER SYSTEMSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the organization and access to information stored in a computer system. More specifically, the present invention relates to the analysis of natural language input to produce structured information output and the processing of notes in a computer system. The present invention also relates to time and action/project management using a computer system. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for collaboration between two or more persons for time and project management.DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ARTMany application programs exist in the prior art for organizing information in particular ways or for manipulating specific types of information. For example, word processing applications are specifically designed for manipulating text documents in a computer system. Similarly databases in the prior art provide means for structuring data in well defined ways. Further, calendaring systems provide a structured way for tracking events or actions required at specified dates and times. Although these prior art applications provide ways for organizing information in particular ways, it is often inconvenient to require a user to switch back and forth between application programs when updates of information are required. 

Moreover, these types of systems require a user to organize the information prior to entering data into the computer system. For example, the user must know to activate a calendaring program if an appointment or action date is to be entered. In separate actions, the user may also need to update lists or databases associated with the appointment or action for which a calendar entry was made. In many prior art systems, the user is required to spend time navigating around a user interface to link information to the desired lists or categories to which it pertains.U.S. Patent Number 5,115,504 entitled "Information Management System" describes a system for linking elements representing stored information in a database. The system comprises a link structure formed in a section of the database independent of the elements, a pointer in the link structure indicating the location of a first element, and a second pointer in the link structure indicating the location of a second element. The database contains items comprising textual data and a plurality of categories into which the items may be categorized such that each

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
We claim:
1. An apparatus for processing text expressions in a computer system, the apparatus comprising: an object database defining an information object with an associated keyword; a user input device for receiving an input text expression; a parsing device for identifying the keyword in the input text expression, the parsing device including functions for linking the input text expression to the information object based on the keyword identified in the input text expression; and a user ouptut device for displaying to the user the identity of the information object to which the input text expression was linked.
2. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the object database includes supplemental information related to the information object, the user ouptut device further including a functions for displaying the supplemental information when a corresponding keyword is identified in the input text expression.
