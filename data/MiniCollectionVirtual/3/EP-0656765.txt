<ABSTRACT>
This invention is an endoscopic surgical instrument (11) having a surgical tool (23) with at least one articulated member (25), a handle, a hollow elongated shaft (12) connecting the tool and handle (27) and having a hole (26) in the shaft for flushing the shaft, and an actuating rod (29) slidably disposed within the lumen of the shaft connecting the handle and the articulated member such that the handle can also be used to actuate the articulated member. Specifically, an endoscopic surgical instrument and an apparatus for attaching to endoscopic surgical instruments having a removable flush port (32) which is in fluid communication with the lumen of the shaft and a removable collar (28) which is removably affixed on the shaft of the instrument by the flush port such that the flush port simultaneously functions as a flush port and as a means for affixing the collar on the shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to endoscopic surgical
instruments having flush ports. More particularly, the
invention relates to a surgical tool with at least one
articulated member, a handle with actuating means for
movement of the articulated member, a hollow elongated shaft
connecting the tool and handle and having a hole in the
shaft for flushing the shaft, and an actuating rod
connecting the actuating means and articulated member such
that the rod is slidably disposed within the lumen of the
shaft. Specifically, the present invention relates to a
means for affixing a removable collar to the shaft of the
instrument whereby the affixing means can also function as
a flush port for flushing the shaft via the hole in the
shaft.Endoscopic surgical procedures are rapidly replacing
conventional surgical techniques in a variety of
applications. Diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopy
procedures are generally preferred because they reduce
trauma, decrease the risk of infection at incision sites,
and increase patient recovery times. Arthroscopy
procedures, for example, have all but replaced arthrotomy
approaches for joint repair. Likewise, laparoscopic surgery
is rapidly becoming the method of choice for a variety of
abdominal procedures that once required large laparotomy
incisions.The laparoscope allows the surgeon to perform surgery
within the abdomen by providing visualization of an
internalized surgical field. The laparoscope and related
instruments are usually introduced into the abdomen through
a self-sealing cannula introduced into the abdomen via a
small incision or trocharized opening in the abdominal wall.
These small openings are generally sealed around the cannula
during the procedure, thereby preventing airborne
contamination of the surgical field and escape of
insufflation gases. After surgery, the incision sites are 
easily closed and usually heal quickly with minimal
scarring.The growing popularity of laparoscopic surgery and the
continuing development of new laparoscopic surgical
techniques has created a need for specialized surgical
instruments. As a result, many surgical instruments have
been designed to meet the special needs of the laparoscopic
surgeon. Most of these instruments, by necessity, contain
certain basic design similarities. For example, in
instruments which are comprised of a tool with an
articulated member which must be actuated by means located
on the handle, the handle is usually connected to the
surgical tool via an elongated hollow shaft which contains
an actuating rod connecting

<CLAIMS>
An endoscopic surgical instrument comprising:

a hollow elongate shaft (12) having a proximal end
(14), an opposite distal end (16), an external surface (18),

and a luminal surface (20) defining a lumen (22);
a surgical tool (23) having at least one articulated
member (25) connected to the distal end of said shaft;
a handle (27), including actuating means (31),
connected to the proximal end of said shaft for imparting

motion to said articulated member;
an actuating rod (29) slidably disposed within the
lumen of said shaft and connecting said actuating means (31)

to said surgical tool (23);
a removable collar (28) on the shaft having an opening
(30); and
an affixing means (32) for attaching the collar to the
shaft, dimensioned to be receivable within and detachably

removable from the opening (30) in the collar;

characterised in that

the shaft (12) has a hole (26) in the external surface
(18) in communication with the luminal surface (20);
the opening (30) of the removable collar (28)
is in registration with the hole in the

external surface of the shaft; and
the affixing means (32) is dimensioned to be receivable
within and detachably removable from the hole (26) in said

shaft and has an opening (48) therethrough which is in fluid
communication with the lumen (22) of the shaft (12).
The instrument of claim 1, wherein said shaft (12) is
rotatably connected to the handle (27) and wherein said

collar (28) further includes a means for causing rotation of
said shaft (12) and said surgical tool (23) about the

longitudinal axis of said shaft relative to said handle. 
The instrument of claim 2, wherein the means for causing
rotation of said shaft (12) comprises at least one gripping

means (34) on the external surface of the collar (28).
The instrument of claim 1, wherein the affixing means
(32) comprises a tube (40) having a first end (42), an

opposite second end (44), a luminal surface (46) defining a
lumen (48) and an external surface (50), such that the lumen

of the tube can be placed in fluid communication with the
lumen (22) of the shaft (12).
The instrument of claim 4, wherein at least a portion of
the surface of the opening (30) in the collar (28) is

threaded (54) and at least a portion of the external surface
(50) of the tube (40) has a complimentary thread (56), the

tube being capable of removably being screwed into the
opening in the collar such that the first end (42) of the

tube forms a fluid tight seal with the hole (26) in the
shaft (12).
The instrument of claim 5, wherein the hole in said
shaft (12) further comprises a first shape (62) and the

first end (42) of the tube (40) further comprises a second
shape (64), complimentary to the first shape, whereby the

first end of the tube is capable of seating within the hole
(26) in the shaft in sealing engagement with the shaft.
The instrument of claim 6, wherein the first shape (62)
is a circular chamfered female countersink and the second

shape (64) is a complimentary male chamfer such that the
first end of the tube is capable of seating with the hole

(26) in said shaft (12) in a self-aligning and sealing
engagement.
The instrument of claim 5, further comprising a means
(66) for attaching a flushing source to the second end (44)
