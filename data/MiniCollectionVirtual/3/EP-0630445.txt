<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to screw compressors of the
type having a slide valve and more particularly to a
control for an axially shiftable slide valve for
regulating the volume ratio and the capacity of the
compressor.Variable capacity rotary screw compressors are known
that have a pair of helical rotors mounted within a
housing for compressing fluid drawn from an inlet at
suction pressure and discharging the compressed fluid
through an outlet at a higher discharge pressure. It is
also known to provide a slide valve that is axially
slidable in a recess in the compressor housing to control
the volume ratio (sometimes referred to in the art as
compression ratio) and the capacity of the compressor.
US-A-4,516,914,
discloses a rotary screw compressor of the
above type having a two-piece slide valve assembly that
includes a slide valve and a slide stop coaxially mounted
for axial sliding movement toward and away from each
other. The slide valve and slide stop each have an inner
face end with the inner faces being in confronting
relation to each other to provide an opening variable in
size and axial position. Both the slide valve and slide
stop are "active" in that their positions are regulated
by hydraulic pistons. A first double-acting piston is
connected to the slide valve to provide positive
regulation of the position thereof and the position of
the slide stop is controlled independently of the slide
stop by a second and separate double-acting piston. Both
pistons are energized by lubricating oil pressure
controlled by hydraulic valves. First and second sensing 
means sense the pressure at the discharge and inlet
openings, respectively. Third and fourth separate and
independent sensing means sense the position of the slide
valve and slide stop members, respectively. A
microcomputer is responsive to the four sensing means to
constantly energize the first and second pistons
independently of each other to regulate the positions of
the slide valve and slide stop to control the volume
ratio and capacity of the compressor.The basic objective of such compressor arrangements
is to control a compressor system condition which, for
example, could be the amount of refrigerated gas usually
expressed in pounds, passing through the compressor which
will determine the temperature at which a refrigeration
unit connected to the compressor is maintained. In many
processing industries, the process temperature must be
maintained within extremely close tolerances to avoid
process failure or diminution of final product quality.
