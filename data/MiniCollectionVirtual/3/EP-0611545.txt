<ABSTRACT>
The vacuum cleaner nozzle of the invention has a nozzle body (1) with a suction-pipe connection and a baseplate (2) which closes off the nozzle body at the bottom, the baseplate having at least one flow channel (3, 4) which is open at the bottom and leads into a central suction channel (5) connected to the suction-tube connection. The flow channel is in this case of double-parabolic shape in profile, i.e. is of parabolic shape both in transverse section and in the longitudinal section running perpendicularly to the base plate, with respect to the longitudinal axis of the flow channel. The transverse section increases here from the bottom of the flow channel in the direction of the base and from that end of the flow channel which faces away from the suction channel in the direction of the suction channel. By virtue of this suction-channel configuration, a more uniform distribution of the suction power over the entire width of the vacuum cleaner nozzle is achieved.
