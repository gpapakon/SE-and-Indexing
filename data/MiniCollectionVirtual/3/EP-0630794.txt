<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for connection between two railway or urban vehicles allowing relative movements of rotation of vertical axis and of horizontal axis between the vehicles, and defining a compartment via which one vehicle intercommunicates with the other, including two elements joined together by a flexible connection, each element being articulated with respect to the adjacent vehicle about a vertical axis common to the latter.

<CLAIMS>
A corridor connection between first and second rail or urban 
transport vehicles (1 
&
 2) whose bodies are connected together by at 
least one coupling bar (3), the connection comprising: 


a first swivelling semi-circular turn-table (4) which, on its 
central longitudinal axis relative to the vehicle (1) with which it 

is associated, is articulated to a first swivel bearing (6) having a 
vertical swivel axis (6a); 
a second swivelling semi-circular turn-table (5) which, on 
its central longitudinal axis relative to the vehicle (2) with which 

it is associated, is articulated to a second swivel bearing (7) 
having a vertical swivel axis (7a); 
 
   the semi-circular portion (4a, 5a) of each turn-table (4, 5) 

co-operating with, so as to swivel relative to, a respective semi-circular 
portion (8a, 9a) formed in the floor (8, 9) of the body of 

the corresponding vehicle (1, 2); 

a first cross-beam (10) secured to that end of said first 
semi-circular turn-table (4) which is remote from the semi-circular 

portion (4a) thereof; 
a second cross-beam (11) secured to that end of said second 
semi-circular turn-table (5) which is remote from the semi-circular 

portion (5a) thereof; and 
at least one longitudinal hinge bar (12, 13) hinged at one 
end to said first cross-beam (10) and at the other end to said second 

cross-beam (11); 
 
   said hinge bars (12, 13) being disposed head-to-tail, one end 

of each hinge bar being hinged in a respective bearing (14a, 14b) 
fixed to the first cross-beam (10) or to the second cross-beam (11), 

the other end of each hinge bar being mounted to slide in a 
respective hinged support (15a, 15b) fixed to the second cross-beam 

(11) or to the first cross-beam (10). 
A corridor connection according to claim 1, including a connection 
frame (16) constituted of two half-frames (17, 18) and whose 

transverse base (16a) rests on both hinge bars (12, 13).
