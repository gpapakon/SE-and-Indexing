<ABSTRACT>
A jaw crusher designed to break a non-rigid material, 
e.g., asphalt, into pieces of desired size without causing 

the material to be undesirably mashed by changing the motion 
of a movable tooth plate relative to a fixed tooth plate. 

The jaw crusher includes a fixed tooth plate (16), a swing 
jaw (8), a movable tooth plate (15), and a toggle plate 

(10). Motion of a lower end portion of the movable tooth 
plate (15) which is on an approximately circular locus 

satisfies the conditions that the relative angle between a 
straight line connecting the lower and upper end points of 

the approximately circular locus and the fixed tooth plate 
(16) is not smaller than 20°, and that the distance between 

the lower and upper end points is not shorter than 50 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a jaw crusher for
breaking a non-rigid object, e.g., asphalt. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a jaw crusher
suitable for breaking a viscous, non-rigid object, e.g.,
asphalt pavement wastes.Jaw crushers are known and used as machines for
breaking rocks, asphalt pavement wastes, concrete scraps,
etc. into pieces of desired size. These days, a large
amount of concrete scrap and asphalt pavement waste are
produced by dismantling of concrete buildings, repair of
asphalt pavements, etc. Treatment of these wastes,
particularly in urban areas, gives rise to a social problem
because of the generation of noise and dust during the
treatment, difficulty in securing a place for dumping
wastes, a high cost of waste transportation, etc. For this
reason, these wastes are desired to be speedily treated and
reused at or near the site where the wastes are produced, as
much as possible.It will be advantageous if asphalt pavement wastes can
be broken into pieces which are sufficiently small in
particle size to be reused as aggregates or other similar
material by using a conventional jaw crusher capable of
efficiently breaking a rigid object, e.g., rocks, into 
pieces of desired size. However, if a conventional jaw
crusher, which has been developed to break rocks or other
rigid objects since the beginning of the development
thereof, is used for breaking asphalt pavement wastes as it
is, the asphalt pavement wastes may be undesirably mashed or
stick to the movable and fixed tooth plates and fail to drop
from the V-shaped crushing space defined between the two
tooth plates. Thus, the conventional jaw crusher becomes
unable to break the object of crushing. Moreover, it is
almost impossible for the conventional machine to crush
asphalt pavement wastes favorably for reuse of them. At
present, conventional jaw crushers are reluctantly used as
they are for breaking asphalt pavement wastes, and reuse of
asphalt pavement wastes is not considered.Incidentally, jaw crushers for breaking rocks include
various types which may be most suitably selected for each
particular use in conformity to the kind of rock to be
crushed and the particle size of pieces into which rocks are
to be broken. We carried out an experiment by breaking
asphalt pavement wastes with these various types of
conventional jaw crusher, and found a new way of improving
the conventional jaw crushers for effectively breaking
asphalt pavement wastes. A jaw crusher according to the preamble of
claim 1 is known from

<CLAIMS>
A jaw crusher for breaking a non-rigid object, e.g.,
asphalt, said jaw crusher comprising:


a body (1);
a fixed tooth plate (16) secured to said body (1);
a swing jaw (8) adapted to swing relative to said fixed

tooth plate (16);
a movable tooth plate (15) secured to said swing jaw
(8) at an acute angle to said fixed tooth plate (16) to

define a crushing space for breaking an object of crushing
between said movable tooth plate (15) and said fixed tooth

plate (16);
an eccentric rotating shaft (7) provided on said body
(1) to swingably support an upper end portion of said swing

jaw (8) and to rotate eccentrically; and
a swing support member (10) provided between said body
(1) and said swing jaw (8) so as to be swingable relative to

both said body (1) and said swing jaw (8);

characterised in that motion of a lower end portion of said movable
tooth plate (15) is on an approximately circular locus and

satisfies the following conditions (U1) and (U2):

(U1) the relative angle between a straight line connecting
lower and upper end points of the approximately circular

locus and said fixed tooth plate (16) is not smaller than
20°; and
(U2) the distance between said lower and upper end points
is not shorter than 50 mm.
