<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a marking of vehicles for impeding theft or unauthorised sale. The marking mounted permanently on the vehicle contains information carriers with data - secondary information - which usually coincides in terms of contents with information - primary information - which is documented elsewhere, is not accessible for manipulation and gives information about the identity of the vehicle, there being the suspicion, if the secondary information deviates from the primary information, that the vehicle is in illegal possession. To achieve a protection of the vehicle identity against forgery (falsification, faking) which is reliable at any time, it is proposed that the information carriers (7) which carry the secondary information be of identical design and be incorporated, at least at specific points, in microscopically small form in the  mu m range, numbering many thousands, like colour pigments (coloured pigments) into a vehicle coating (5, 6).

Method of marking vehicles to hinder theft or
unauthorized sale, information carriers being permanently

applied to the vehicle with data - secondary information
- which normally coincides in terms of content with

information providing details on the identity of the
vehicle - primary information - which is stored in some

other way and is not accessible to manipulation, the
suspicion of unlawful vehicle ownership existing if the

secondary information deviates from the primary
information, characterized in that the information

carriers carrying the secondary information are
incorporated in the manner of pigments into a vehicle

coating (5), (6), at least at certain locations,
identically in many thousands and in the microscopically

small form, in the Âµm range, of platelets (7) which are
formed as embossed sections of a thin aluminium foil

(12).
