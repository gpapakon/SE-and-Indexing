<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a resist ink 
composition characterized by comprising a specific 

unsaturated polycarboxylic acid resin (A) or a 
specific unsaturated polycarboxylic acid/urethane 

resin (A'), a photopolymerization initiator (B), a 
diluent (C), and a curing component (D) and a cured 

article prepared therefrom. 
In the formation of a solder resist pattern via 
selective UV-exposure through a patterned film 

followed by development of the unexposed part, the 
composition of the present invention is excellent in 

developability even though at a small acid value (mg 
KOH/g) or over a prolonged drying time and shows a 

resistance of the exposed part against the developing 
solution. Further, a cured article prepared therefrom 

is excellent in electroless gold plating resistance 
and fully satisfactory in adhesion and soldering 

heat resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resist ink composition
and a cured article prepared therefrom. This
resist ink composition is usable in a solder resist
for the production of a printed circuit board or an
electroless plating resist and can be developed with a
dilute aqueous alkali solution and the cured article
prepared therefrom is excellent in adhesiveness,
soldering heat resistance and electroless gold plating
resistance.In recent years, there have been widely used
ultraviolet-curing compositions in various fields for
reasons of saving energy, saving resources, improving
workability and elevating productivity. In the field
of processing printed circuit boards, there occurs a
shift of the conventional heat-curing ink compositions
(for example, solder resist inks and marking inks) to
ultraviolet-curing ones for the same reasons.Screen printing has been widely applied to the
formation of resist patterns on printed circuit boards. 
However, this screen printing method frequently
suffers from bleeding, bleed-through or sagging in the
printing step, which makes it unsuitable for the
recent tendency toward high-density printed circuit
boards and surface mounting of parts.In order to solve these problems, there have been
developed photoresists of dry film type and liquid
photo solder resists. The photoresists of dry film
type have some disadvantages such that they are liable
to form bubbles in the step of thermocompression,
precarious in heat resistance and adhesiveness and
expensive. As the liquid photo solder resists, on the
other hand, solder resist ink compositions comprising
a partial reaction product obtained from a novolak
epoxy resin and acrylic acid as the main component are
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 208337/1985 and No. 59447/1986. To develop these
ink compositions, however, it is necessary to use an
organic solvent such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
trichloroethylene, toluene or cyclohexanone, which
brings about some problems in working environment and
economy. In order to solve these problems
accompanying the use of organic solvents, there has
been proposed solder resist ink compositions which can
be developed with dilute aqueous alkali solutions. 
For example, USP. 5009982
has disclosed a resist ink composition comprising a
product of reaction between a reaction product
obtained from a novolak epoxy resin and acrylic acid
with a polybasic acid anhydride as the main component.
In the case of this resist ink composition, however,
it is necessary to adjust the acid value of
