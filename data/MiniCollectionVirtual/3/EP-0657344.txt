<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a wheeled vehicle which has at least one steered main vehicle wheel (4) which is situated at the front of the wheeled vehicle, and at least one non-steered main vehicle wheel (7) which is situated at the rear of the wheeled vehicle. The front wheel (4) includes a suspension element (2) which has a connecting part (6) to the rear wheel (7). Handlebars (3), which are to be controlled manually, are provided for the front wheel (4). In order to be able to propel the wheeled vehicle by using the rider's arms and hands, it is proposed to provide the front wheel (4) with a free-wheel lock (34) and to mount the handlebars on the suspension element (2) in a manner which allows them to swivel to and fro around a geometrical swivelling axis parallel to the geometrical rotational axis of the front wheel (4) and to connect said handlebars to the front wheel (4) in a manner such that they can propel it.
