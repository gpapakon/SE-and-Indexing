<ABSTRACT>
A dental cast tray (100) subassembly for forming a 
dental cast model and for mounting to a dental 

articulator (36). The tray subassembly forms a channel (109) 
shaped in a configuration of a human jaw to receive a 

mold material for forming a dental cast model. The 
channel further includes ribs (112) for registering the 

model relative to the channel and a release mechanism (113) 
for releasing the model from the channel. Further 

included is a platform (57) for interconnecting with 
connectors for connecting the subassembly to an 

articulator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dental cast trays subassembly
for forming a dental cast model and for mounting to a dental
articulator according to the preamble of claim 1.
A dental cast tray of that kind is known from US-A 4157435
and includes first and second side members and a bottom
member which can be joined together to form a tray, and
disassembled to remove the dental cast.
The side members and the bottom member have ribs which
are oriented orthogonally to one another so that a dental
cast which has been removed can be properly inserted into
the tray when the same is assembled.
There is a disadvantage with the prior art tray in that
it is not jaw - shaped but takes only a portion of the
periphery of a jaw. A tray with an outer jaw shaped
periphery cannot be disassembled as in the prior art
document. Therefore, removal of the dental cast from the
tray and reinserting same on proper place of a tray having
an outer jaw shape periphery remains a problem.With articulators used for supporting impressions
of human jaws with artificial teeth and including a
lower jaw model and an upper jaw model, it is
important that they be capable of simulating the full
range of occlusal and masticatory registrations among
the patient population. As such, the lower jaw model
and the upper jaw model are supported by the
articulator to be positioned in a contiguous
relationship to provide centric, lateral and
protrusive movement relative to each other. This is
for simulating a patient's bite. While there are a
wide variety of shapes, sizes and arrangements of
human jaws and teeth, configurations and occlusion
patterns have a broad range among different patients. 
Nevertheless, the process of making jaw impressions
for the fabrication of partial dentures, fix bridges
and crowns by using jaw models in a dental laboratory
requires that a precise registration and desired
occlusal alignment be maintained. Therefore, it is
necessary to have articulators that meet these
requirements.Articulators which provide such a wide range of
registration and simplicity in use are disclosed in
U.S. Patent 5,076,786 entitled "Cast Dental
Articulator System and Method", issued on December 31,
1991 to Lars E. Callne. Likewise, another articulator
which is further improved is disclosed in U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 07/863,196, filed April 3, 1992
for "Cast Dental Model Articulator" by Lars E.
Callne.Additionally, to further facilitate and simplify
the procedures, there is a need for providing a
subassembly wherein the models may be formed

model and for mounting to a dental articulator (36), the

subassembly comprising:

a tray (102; 102', 102'') with a pair of sidewalls
(104, 106; 104', 106'; 104'', 106'') and a bottom wall

(108; 108', 108'') for receiving a quantity of mold
material for forming a dental cast model (110; 110';

110'')
release means (113, 118; 202, 204; 308, 314)

from the tray; and
registration means within at least one of said side-walls
(104, 106; 104', 106' ; 104'', 106'') and about

an interior periphery of said canal (109; 109'; 109'')
to interface with said mold material and to register

a position of a cured dental case model (110; 110';
110''),

characterized in that said tray (102; 102'; 102'')
has an outer jaw-shaped periphery with said side-walls

(104, 106, 104', 106', 104'', 106'') being
integral with said bottom wall (108; 108'; 108'')

to form a convex canal (109; 109'; 109''), and in that
said release means (113, 118; 202, 204; 308, 314)

includes an elongated slot (113; 308) along said
bottom wall, and an elongated member (118; 202; 314)

engaged within said slot (113; 308) of the tray
(100; 200; 300) and along said bottom wall

(108; 108'; 108'') to interface with and adhere
to said mold material such that the dental cast model

can be readily removed and replaced to the tray.

member of the release means is an elongated spinal

column (118) with a string of keys (120) aligned along a
