<ABSTRACT>
A method and a system in a distributed data processing 
network for enhancing the processing of a plurality of 

related data packets received at a receiving station (100) 
within the distributed data processing network, each of 

the data packets having a header associated herewith includes 
sequentially receiving a number of data packets at 

the receiving station. Next, the header associated with a 
first data packet is examined and a predicted profile is 

generated for comparison with a related subsequent data 
packet. The next data packet received is then compared 

with the predicted profile to determine whether or not the 
two data packets may be consolidated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method and
apparatus for processing incoming data packets and in
particular to method and apparatus for reducing overhead in
processing data packets.Various communication systems, computer systems, and networks
of computers transmit and receive information in the form of
frames or data packets. That is, a message or a file may be
broken up into many data packets and sent to another user or
computer on the system or network. Each data packet is a
separate entity on the transmission media.In the transmission of these data packets, a processing
overhead exists in terms of the time needed to process the data
packet.Batching or consolidating single data packets into groups can
reduce the processing overhead when compared to processing the
same number of data packets separately. Consequently,
consolidating data packets into a group or a super data packet
can reduce the processing overhead since the system can process
the super data packet a single time. Consolidating data packets
into super data packets, however, presents some problems. Data
packets may arrive on the transmission media asynchronously and
at somewhat random intervals. In addition, data packets
transmitted as a group from a source system do not always
arrive as a group at the target or receiving system. That is,
data packets from multiple connections may be interspersed
among each other. Some data processing systems include a special dedicated bit in
the processing header of the data packets as a form of
identification. This type of system, however, requires both the
sending system and the receiving system to be aware of the
dedicated bit, in order to decrease processing overhead of the
data packets. The "header" is that portion of a message which
contains control information for the message such as: one or
more destination fields; the name of the originating station;
an input sequence number; a character string indicating the
type of message; and, a priority level for the message.Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method and apparatus
for consolidating data packets into groups to reduce the
overhead necessary to process the data packets without
requiring both the sending and receiving systems to observe a
protocol which identifies batched data packets.European Patent Application EP-A-0 404 078 (Hitachi, Ltd.)

Received from a Network into a Message" discloses a
