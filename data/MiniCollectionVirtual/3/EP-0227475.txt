<ABSTRACT>
A variable displacement turbocharger comprises a 
turbine casing (1), a shroud (3) coaxially within the 

casing and a gas outlet cover (2) connected to the 
casing. The casing (1), the shroud (3) and the gas 

outlet cover (2) together define a closed annular space 
(8). The casing (1) and the shroud (3) together define 

a space which accommodates a turbine wheel (11) and 
which communicates with a gas inlet passage within the 

casing (1) through an annular passage in which a 
plurality of nozzle blades (6) are situated. Each 

nozzle blade (6) is rotatably carried by a nozzle shaft 
(4) and the nozzle shafts (4) are connected by 

respective links (27) to a common nozzle driving ring 
(9) within the annular space (8). The driving ring (9) 

is connected to actuating means (21,24) outside the 
space (8), movement of which results in rotation of the 

driving ring (9) and thus of the nozzle blades (6) to 
adjust the flow rate of exhaust gases to the turbine 

wheel. The driving ring (9) is axially retained by the 
accommodation of its periphery in a space defined 

between the casing (1) and the gas outlet cover (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to turbochargers and 
is concerned with variable displacement turbochargers 
of the type comprising a turbine casing, a shroud 
within the casing and a gas outlet cover connected to 
the casing, the casing, the shroud and the gas outlet 
cover together defining a closed annular space and the 
casing and the shroud together defining a space which 
accommodates a turbine wheel and which communicates 
with the gas inlet passage within the casing through an 
annular passage in which a plurality of nozzle blades 
are situated, each nozzle blade being rotatably carried 
by a nozzle shaft and the nozzle shafts being connected 
by respective links to a nozzle driving ring within the 
annular space, the driving ring being connected to 
actuating means outside the space, movement of which 
results in rotation of the driving ring and thus of the 
nozzle blades. Turbochargers, which serve to improve the thermal 
efficiency of various types of prime movers or engines, 
are driven by the exhaust gases from the engines. The 
flow rate of exhaust gases from an engine varies 
depending on the load on the engine so that 
conventionally part of the performance of the 
turbocharger is sacrificed. To overcome this problem, 
variable turbochargers have recently been developed in 
which the angle of the nozzle blades is varied 
depending on the load on the engine so as to control 
the flow rate of exhaust gases flowing to the turbine 
wheel in an optimum manner, whereby a high degree of 
thermal efficiency can be maintained at all times.  The turbine unit of a known variable displacement 
turbocharger of the type described above is shown in 
Figures 11 and 12 in which Figure 11 is a side 
sectional view and Figure 12 is a transverse sectional 
view on the line C-C in Figure 11. The turbine unit 
includes a shroud 3 which is clamped between a turbine 
casing 1 and a gas outlet cover 2 and rotatably carries 
nozzle shafts 4 in bearings 5. A nozzle blade 6 is 
securely attached to one end of each nozzle shaft 4 on 
the turbine casing side and one end of a nozzle link 7 
is attached to the other end of the nozzle shaft 4 on 
the gas outlet cover side. An annular or generally toroidal space 8 defined 
between the gas outlet cover 2 and the shroud 3 
accommodates the nozzle links 7 and a nozzle driving 
ring 9 positioned and rotatably supported by 
projections of the bearings 5. The nozzle driving ring 
9 is connected by intermediate links 10 to the other 
ends of the nozzle links 7. A turbine wheel 11
