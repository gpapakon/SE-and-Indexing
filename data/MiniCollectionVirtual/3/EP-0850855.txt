<ABSTRACT>
The drain comprises a cylindrical outer housing (2) with open ends between which is a bridge-piece (12) containing a through-passage (13). A buoyant closure element (18) closes the through-passage and is positioned on the top of the bridge-piece. A second buoyant closure element (19) for the through-passage is situated on the underside of the bridge-piece. The bridge-piece is connected to a valve cage (11) removably inserted into the outer housing. The bridge-piece divides the valve cage into a top and bottom chambers (14,15). The bridge-piece has a top (16) and bottom(17) valve seating. The outer housing's top end (8) has a fixture flange (9) tightly fixed to the underside of an inner plate facing the storage compartment. The underside (5) of the outer housing is positioned in a beaker-shaped holder fixed to an outer plate of the multi-layered container base (1).

An arrangement of an automatic drainage device
for freight containers or other freight-holding

compartments, comprising a substantially cylindrical
outer casing (2) with open end portions and a valve

plate (12) formed with a passage opening (13)
between the two end portions, the top of the valve

plate being associated with a first floating means
(18) for closing the passage opening (13),

characterised in that the outer casing (2) is
disposed in a multilayer-construction container

bottom (1) so that an underside (20) of a securing
flange (9) provided at the top end (8) of the outer

casing (2) is fastened in sealing-tight manner to an
inner plate (21) facing the freight compartment and

an underside (5) of the outer casing (2) is disposed
in a cup-like holder (22) fastened to an outer plate

(23) of the container bottom (1), and in that a
second floating means (19) for closing the passage

(13) is associated with the underside of the valve
plate (12).
An arrangement of a drainage device according
to claim 1, characterised in that the valve plate

(12) is connected to a valve cage (11) inserted in
removable manner into the outer casing (2).
An arrangement of a drainage device according
to claim 2, characterised in that the valve plate

(12) divides the valve cage (11) into a top valve
chamber (14) and a bottom valve chamber (15). 
An arrangement of a drainage device according
to claim 3, characterised in that the first floating

closure means (18) is disposed in the top valve
chamber (14) and the second floating closure means

(19) is disposed in the bottom valve chamber (15).
An arrangement of a drainage device according
to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the closure

means (18, 19) comprise balls.
An arrangement of a drainage device according
to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that in the

region of its passage opening (13) the valve plate
(12) has a top valve seat (16) on its top surface

and a bottom valve seat (17) on its underside, the
valve seats being sealingly adapted to the surfaces

of the respective closure means (18, 19).
An arrangement of a drainage device according
to claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the holder

(22) projects downwards beyond the outer plate (23).
An arrangement of a drainage device according
to claims 1 - 7, characterised in that at its bottom

end (24) the holder (22) has a funnel-like end piece
(25) which screens holes (10) in a bottom cover (6)

of the outer casing (2).
An arrangement of a drainage device according
to claims 1 - 8, characterised in that the holder 

(22) has an annular flange (26) adjoining the outer
plate (23) for fastening it to the outer plate (23).
