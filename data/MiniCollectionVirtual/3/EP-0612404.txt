<ABSTRACT>
The invention covers a procedure for the production of useful amorphous test specimens, for the gravimetric analysis of oxygen or other indirect determination of oxygen absorption, through oxidation and melting of the test sample intended for analysis together with a flux agent whereby before the oxidation pulverised GeO2 in the proportion of 1 - 200 % of the weight of the test sample and hydrogen peroxide in the proportion of 10 - 500 % of the weight of the test sample and lithium hydroxide or another alkaline hydroxide in the proportion of 1 - 50 % of the weight of the test sample are added. Test specimens obtained by the procedures in this invention are used for gravimetric analysis of oxygen or other indirect determination of oxygen and for the analysis of the oxidised elements or their elemental oxides in geological materials, inorganic environmental materials and sulphuric and/or oxideproducts from ferrous and non-ferrous production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The proposed invention covers a procedure according to the preamble of claim 1 for fusing
specimens in glass in such a way that the fused specimen's
oxygenabsorption can be gravimetrically analysed or its
oxygen content determined by other indirect means.The fusing of specimens in glass for test preparation
has been used successfully for some decades in inorganic
analysis.When using X-ray spectrometry analysis, specimens
produced in this way have solved the problem of grain size
effects. In optical spectrometry this type of glass is
often used for testspecimens of materials containing
volatile substances such as minerals formed at high
pressure/temperature. The main aim of these analytical
procedures has been the determination of metal or rock
forming elements but not oxygen.The technical literature describes a multitude of
different ways of making glass incorporating oxidising
agents with varying reactions. The use of
GeO2 as a glass-forming addition is previously known per se
from X-RAY SPECTROMETRY; vol. 14, 1985, p, 69-73.The main aims are to create, as far as possible, an
amorphous glass and quantitatively incorporate the
components of the testspecimen into the glass. Problems
arise in cases where volatiles, polyoxidising oxides or
sulphides are present. The treatment of specimens with
volatiles is simple in cases where these can be removed at
temperatures just above 100 degrees C. Where the volatiles
are given off at higher temperatures the ability to
determine the oxygen content is lost because one cannot
determine the origin or more precisely the quantity of the
absorbed oxygen from the volatiles, for example water of
crystallisation. In specimens with many oxidising oxides
the sum of the absorbed oxygen can be determined by this
method and can in many cases lead to the determination of
valences and quantitative relationships. In cases where 
sulphides are present the oxidation results in conversion
to sulphates which are deposited in the glass. The
difficulty here is that the sulphur is easily lost during
the oxidation process and is considerably more unstable
than the oxides. This process as defined in the appended claims suggests procedures which
quantitatively bind the compounds of the particular
inorganic substances in their existing valency states in
order to subsequently oxidise these into higher valencies
by means of a controlled oxidation process.One trait which is frequently underestimated when
analysing glasstest specimens is the change in the test
specimen-fluxrelationship as a
