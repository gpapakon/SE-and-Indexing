<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to recording sheets, such as transparency materials, 
filled plastics, papers, and the like. More specifically, the present invention is directed to recording 
sheets particularly suitable for use in ink jet printing processes. Recording sheets suitable for use in ink jet printing are known. For example, US-A-4,740,420 
(Akutsu et al.) discloses a recording medium for ink jet printing comprising a support 
material containing at least in the surface portion thereof a water soluble metal salt with the ion 
valence of the metal thereof being 2 to 4 and a cationic organic material. The cationic organic 
materials include salts of alkylamines, quaternary ammonium salts, polyamines, and basic latexes. US-A-4,576,867 (Miyamoto) discloses an ink jet recording paper with improved water 
resistance and sunlight fastness of the image formed on the paper wherein the recording paper 
has attached to its surface a cationic resin of the formula 
 
wherein R1, R2, and R3 represent alkyl groups, m represents a number of 1 to 7, and n represents a 
number of 2 to 20, and Y represents an acid residue. US-A-4,830,911 (Kojima et al.) discloses a recording sheet for ink jet printers which 
gives an image by the use of an aqueous ink containing a water-soluble dye, coated or 
impregnated with either of or a mixture of two kinds of water soluble polymers, one whose 
polymeric unit is alkylquaternaryammonium (meth)acrylate and the other whose polymer unit is 
alkylquaternaryammonium (meth)acrylamide, wherein the water soluble polymers contain not 
less than 50 mol percent of a monomer represented by the formula  
 
 
where R represents hydrogen or methyl group, n is an interger from 1 to 3 inclusive, R1, R2, and R3 
represent hydrogen or the same or different aliphatic alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, X 
represents an anion such as a halogen ion, sulfate ion, alkyl sulfate ion, alkyl sulfonate ion, aryl 
sulfonate ion, and acetate ion, and Y represents oxygen or imino group. US-A-5,141,840 discloses a light sensitive compound for making a lithographic 
printing plate, comprising a polysiloxane compound and an onium salt, such as a sulfonium salt. US-A-4,885,233 discloses a photographic recording material employing a 
combination of a mercury compound and a benzothiazolium compound. While known compositions and processes are suitable for their intended purposes, a 
ned remains for improved recording sheets. In addition, there is a need for improved recording 
sheets suitable for use in ink
