<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigeration apparatus which has a plurality of thermal
source units and which is capable of performing a cooling operation and a heating
operation at the same time.In UK Patent Application GB 2 248 494 A, a multi-airconditioner including a plurality
of outdoor units and at least one indoor unit is described. Refrigerant conduits connecting
the outdoor units and the at least one indoor unit are united by way of a
single common liquefied refrigerant conduit and a single common gasified refrigerant
conduit. A multi-conditioner for effecting simultanous room-cooling and
room-heating operations, in which some of the indoor units are in room-cooling operation
while the other indoor-units are in room-heating operation, may for each outdoor
unit and each indoor unit have a liquefied refrigerant conduit, a high-pressure
gasified refrigerant conduit and these be connected by way of a single common
liquefied refrigerant conduit, a single common high-pressure gasified refrigerant
conduit and a single common low-pressure gasified refrigerant conduit.Conventionally, there has been known a multi-type air conditioner as a refrigeration
apparatus in which a plurality of indoor units are connected to a single outdoor unit
through refrigerant piping so as to be arranged in parallel with one another, as
disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Gazette No. 3-16157. The
outdoor unit has a compressor, a four-way selector valve, two outdoor heat exchangers, 
an outdoor motor-operated expansion valve and a receiver. The indoor
unit has an indoor motor-operated expansion valve and indoor heat exchanger. The
outdoor heat exchangers are each connected at an end thereof to the discharge
and inlet sides of the compressor through the four-way selector valve so as to be
switchable between the two sides of the compressor by the four-way selector valve.
The outdoor heat exchangers is each connected at the other end to a liquid line.
The liquid line 
is connected to an end of the indoor heat exchanger. The discharge
side and the inlet side of the compressor are connected
to a high-pressure gas line and a low-pressure gas line, respectively.
The high-pressure and low-pressure gas lines are
connected to the other end of the indoor hear exchanger so as
to be switchable therebetween.At a cooling operation, refrigerant discharged from the
compressor is circulated, in such a manner as to be condensed
at the outdoor heat exchanger, reduced in pressure at the
indoor motor-operated expansion valve,
