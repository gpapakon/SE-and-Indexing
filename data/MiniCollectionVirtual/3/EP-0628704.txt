<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device intended for recycling (recirculating) a lubricant which is accumulated in a volume (11) of an internal combustion engine with pneumatic fuel injection, the volume connecting the crank case (8) of the said engine to a passage for the inlet of carburetted fuel under pressure into the combustion chamber (1), the passage being equipped with an intermittent shut off element (6) and the volume (11) including a non-return valve (12). According to the invention, at least one calibrated passage (14) passing through the separation wall between the said volume (11) and the said crank case (8) is provided. Furthermore, the end of the passage (14) via which the lubricant leaves the volume (11) is situated at the lowermost point of the volume (11).

Device designed for recycling a lubricant that 
has accumulated in a volume (11) of a pneumatic fuel 

injection internal combustion engine, in which the volume 
links a crankcase (8) of the said en
gine to an inlet 
orifice for a compressed carburetted mixture into a 

combustion chamber (1), the orifice being fitted with an 
intermittent closing element (6) and the volume (11) 

having a non-return valve (12), characterised in that it 
has at least one calibrated passage (14) passing through 

the dividing wall between the said volume (11) and the 
crankcase (8) and the end of the said passage (14) by 

which the lubricant leaves the said volume (11) is 
located at the lowest point of the volume (11). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the cross-section of the passage or passages (14) on 

the side of the volume (11) ranges between 0.5 mm
2
 and 10 
mm
2
. 
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the passage or passages 

(14) have a constant cross-section over their entire 
length. 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the passage or passages (14) have a 

cross-section that is not constant over their entire 
length. 
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the calibrated passage or 

passages (14) have a vertically oriented longitudinal 
axis.
