<ABSTRACT>
In an X-ray tube apparatus of a rotating anode 
type, a stator (23) surrounds an anode rotary structure 

(15) and an insulating container section (17) placed 
around the outer periphery of a stationary structure 

(21) such that a portion of its coil conductor (31) 
located near the anode target (19) side constitutes 

an expanding flared coil conductor portion (31a). 
Therefore, it is possible, for the X-ray tube equipped 

with an envelope having a large-diameter metal section 
and small-diameter insulating container section, to 

shorten the axial length from an anode target of the 
X-ray tube to a far end of the rotary structure and to 

suppress the build-up of electric charges on the inner 
surface of the insulating container section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an X-ray tube 
apparatus of a rotating anode type according to the preamble of claim 1 and, in particular, 
an improvement in the structure of a rotating anode type 
X-ray tube as a vacuum container equipped with a metal 
container section for receiving an anode target, in the 
structure of an X-ray tube holding housing for holding 
the rotating anode type X-ray tube and in the structure 
of a stator for rotational drive. As well-known in the prior art, the rotating anode 
type X-ray tube is mounted within an X-ray tube holding 
housing filled with an insulating oil. The X-ray tube 
apparatus of a rotating anode type is equipped with a 
stator of an electromagnetic induction motor for rotating 
a rotary structure of the X-ray tube at high 
speeds. The stator above is comprised of an iron 
core/coil conductor-combined unit and located near the 
outer periphery of a vacuum envelope for housing the 
rotary structure in the X-ray tube corresponding to a 
rotor of the motor. As shown in FIG. 1, the stator 13 is constructed by 
a stator coil conductor 12 wound along a number of slits 
formed in a cylindrical iron core 11, that is, a core 
comprised of stacked thin sheet rings made of a ferromagnetic 
material. On the other hand, the X-ray 
tube 14 is equipped, as well known in the art, with a 
glass container section 17 of a vacuum envelope 16  
 
surrounding a rotary structure 15. A disc-like anode 
target 19 is arranged in the vacuum envelope 16 at a 
metal container section 18 of a large diameter. The 
anode target 19 is fixed by a rotation shaft 20 to the 
rotary structure 15 and supported there. The rotary 
structure 15 is rotatably held on a stationary structure 
21 by bearing means not shown. In FIG. 1, reference 
numeral 18a denotes a corona ring extending from the 
metal container section; 17a, an expanding flared 
section of the glass container section; and 17b, a 
small-diameter cylindrical section of the glass 
container section. The stator 13 is arranged near the outer periphery 
of the small-diameter cylindrical section 17b of the 
glass container section. A rotation magnetic field is 
generated mainly on the inside of the iron core 11, 
acting upon the rotary structure 15 and hence rotating 
the rotary structure at high speeds. With the conventional X-ray tube apparatus having 
a structure as shown in FIG. 1, the coil conductor 12 of 
the stator 13 linearly extends toward the anode target 
side and the ion core 11 is relatively spaced far apart 
from the anode
