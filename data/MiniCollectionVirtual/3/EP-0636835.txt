<ABSTRACT>
A swirl mixer (10) for a fuel nozzel has a mixing 
duct (12) comprising a center duct (20) and two annular 

ducts (22,24) located radially outward therefrom. Each 
duct has an air inlet and swirling vanes located 

adjacent thereto. The outlet (30) of the center duct 
(20) is located entirely within the annular duct (22) 

located radially outward therefrom, to produce a 
confluence of the air flowing therethrough. The 

airflows within the ducts have significantly different 
swirl angles tailored to yield low smoke production and 

high relight stability in a high temperature rise 
combustor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an fuel/air mixer for
a combustor, such as the type of combustor used on gas turbine engine,
and more specifically, to an fuel/air mixer that uniformly mixes fuel
and air so as to reduce smoke produced by combustion of the fuel/air
mixture while maintaining or improving the flame relight stability of
the combustor.One goal of designers of combustors, such as those used in the gas
turbine engines of high performance aircraft, to minimize the amount
of smoke and other pollutants produced by the combustion process in
the gas turbine engine. For military aircraft in particular, smoke
production creates a "signature" which makes high flying aircraft much
easier to spot than if no smoke trail is visible. Accordingly, designers
seek to design combustors to minimize smoke production.Another goal of designers of combustors for high performance
aircraft is to maximize the "relight stability" of a combustor. The term
"relight stability" refers to the ability to initiate the combustion process
at high airflows and low pressures after some event has extinguished
the combustion process. Poor relight stability can lead to loss of an
aircraft and/or a loss of life, depending on the conditions at the time
the combustor failed to relight. In the typical combustors in use in gas
turbines today, relight stability is directly related to total airflow in the 
combustor.As those skilled in the art will readily
appreciate, smoke production can be minimized by leaning
out the fuel/air mixture in the combustor. Likewise,
relight stability can be increased by enriching the
fuel/air mixture. Thus, in the past, designers of
combustors have been forced to choose between low smoke
production and high relight stability.What is needed is method and apparatus which
reduces smoke production and increases stability in the
combustor of a gas turbine engine.It is therefore an object of the present invention
at least in its preferred embodiments to provide a
fuel/air mixer for a combustor of a gas turbine engine
which achieves the competing goals of low smoke
production and high relight stability.Another object of the present invention at least in
its preferred embodiments is to provide an air fuel
mixer which uniformly mixes fuel and air to minimize
smoke formation of when the fuel/air mixture is ignited
in the combustor.Another object of the present invention at least in
its preferred embodiments is to provide a fuel/air mixer
which exhibits high relight stability at altitude
conditions.US-A-3811278
