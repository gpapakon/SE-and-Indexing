<ABSTRACT>
The bar feed (bar loader) according to the invention comprises two bar guides (1, 2) which are parallel and laterally offset with respect to each other, and mounted on a moving support (3) which can itself be moved laterally in order to bring one or other of the bar guides (1, 2) alternately into alignment with the principal axis of the lathe. A single motor drives the driving gear (14) of the first bar guide (1) or the driving wheel (20) of the second bar guide (2) by means of a transmission with a clutch. The first bar guide (1) comprises a chain (13) and tab (tag) (11) drive, and is designed for relatively high diameters of bar stock. The second bar guide (2) comprises a drive by means of axial flexible cable (17) and is designed for smaller diameters of bar stock. Such a bar feed makes it possible to convey bar stock for machining into a lathe.

Bar feeder for an automatic lathe, comprising a first bar guide 
(1) mounted on a frame (8) and associated with means for introducing 

a bar into the first bar guide (1), and with means for axially 
pushing the bar into the first bar guide (1) and into the lathe, 

characterised in that it comprises: 

at least one second bar guide (2) mounted on the same frame (8) 
and associated with means of introducing a bar into the second bar 

guide , and with means for axially pushing the bar into the second 
bar guide and into the lathe, 
a mobile support (3) carrying the first bar guide (1), and the 
second bar guide (2) in positions offset laterally from one another, 

the mobile support (3) being displaceable on the frame (8) between a 
first position in which the first bar guide (1) is aligned on the 

main axis of the lathe, and a second position in which the second 
bar guide (2) is aligned on the main axis of the lathe, 
the respective diameters of the bar guides (1, 2) being different 
from one another in order to enable bars of different appropriate 

diameters to be introduced. 
Bar feeder according to claim 1, characterised in that: 

the first bar guide (1) is of the type driven by a longitudinal 
endless chain (13) offset laterally and stretched between a drive 

pinion (14) and a return pinion (15), the chain (13) being connected  
 

to an axial carriage (12) in the first bar guide by a tag (11) 
passing through a longitudinal slot (10) in the first bar guide (1), 
the second bar guide (2) is of the type driven by a flexible cable 
(17) sliding axially in the channel of the second bar guide (2) and 

in a reserve cable-guiding tube (19), and driven by a drive wheel 
(20). 
Bar feeder according to claim 2, characterised in that the means 
of axially pushing the bar into the bar guides (1, 2) comprise: 


a single motor (27), 
a mechanical transmission for transmitting the movement of the 
single motor (27) either to the drive pinion (14) of the first bar 

guide (1) or to the drive wheel (20) of the second bar guide (2). 
Bar feeder according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
mechanical transmission comprises a clutch disc (34) slidingly 

mounted on a drive shaft (31) driven by the motor (27) and secured 
against rotation on said drive shaft (31), the clutch disc (34) 

being capable of sliding between a first position in which it comes 
into contact with the side of the drive pinion (14) of the first bar 

guide (1) in order to cause it to rotate, and a second position in 
which it comes into contact with the side of the drive wheel (20) of 

the second bar guide (2) in order to cause it to rotate, the drive 
pinion (14) and the drive wheel (20) being coaxial with respect to 

the drive shaft (31).  
 
Bar feeder according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that: 


on the mobile support (3) the two main channels of the bar guides 
(1, 2) are disposed in parallel and are offset laterally with 

respect to one another with an appropriate centre distance between 
axes (E), 
the mobile support (3) is mounted on transverse guides (7) of the 
frame (8), on which said guides it can slide between its first 

position and its second position, 
locking means (9) are provided to lock the mobile support (3) in 
one and the other of its first and second positions. 
Bar feeder according to claim 2, characterised in that the drive 
tag (11) of the first bar guide (1) is oriented laterally in the 

opposite direction to the second bar guide (2). 
Bar feeder according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the two bar guides (1, 2) are made up of a single tubular 

member (4) made up of a lower half-shell (5) fixed on the mobile 
support (3), and of an upper half-shell (6) articulated on the lower 

half-shell (5) about a lateral and longitudinal axis of rotation 

(III) enabling simultaneous opening and closing of the two main 
channels of the bar guides (1, 2)
