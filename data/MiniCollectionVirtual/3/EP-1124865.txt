<ABSTRACT>
A process for polymerizing a cationically polymerizable olefin such as a mixtrue of isoprene and isobutylene to produce butyl rubber. The process is conducted at subatmospheric pressure in the presence of a conventional cationic polymerization catalyst system. The preferred cationic polymerization catalyst system comprises Cp*TiMe3 and B(C6H5)3. By conducting the process in this manner at subatmospheric pressure, a polymer having desirable molecular weight properties may be produced at a higher temperature than conventional means thereby lower capital and operating costs of the plant producing the polymer product.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZING A CATIONICALLY POLYMERIZABLE OLEFINTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a process for polymerizing at least one cationically polymerizable olefin.BACKGROUND ARTCationic polymerization of olefins is known in the art. Conventional, cationic polymerization is effected using a catalyst system comprising: (i) a Lewis acid, (ii) a tertiary alkyl initiator molecule containing a halogen, ester, ether, acid or alcohol group, and, optionally, (iii) an electron donor molecule such as ethyl acetate. Such catalysts systems have been used for the so-called "living" and "non-living" carbocationic polymerization of olefins.Component (ii) of the catalyst system typically is a compound having the formula:wherein R1, R2 and R3 are a variety of alkyl or aromatic groups or combinations thereof, n is the number of initiator molecules and X is the functional group on which the Lewis acid effects a change to generate a carbocationic initiatiation site - i.e., X typically is a halogen, ester, ether, acid or alcohol group depending on the Lewis acid employed. One or two X groups per initiator molecule tends to lead to the production of substantially linear 

polymers, whereas three or more X groups per initiator molecule tends to lead to the production of substantially star polymers.Catalyst systems based on halogens and/or alkyl-containing Lewis acids , such as boron trichloride and titanium tetrachloride, use various combinations of the above components and typically have similar process characteristics . For the so-called "living" polymerization systems, it is conventional for Lewis acid concentrations to exceed the concentration of initiator sites by 16 to 40 times in order to achieve 100 percent conversion in 30 minutes (based upon a degree of polymerization equal to 890) at -75° to -80°C. Examples of the so-called "living " polymerization systems are taught inUnited States patents 4,929,683 and United States patent 4,910,321, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. Specifically, these patents teach the use of Lewis acids in combination with organic acids, organic esters or organic ethers to form cationic polymerization initiators that also create a complex counter anion. Apparently, the complex counter anion does not assist in or cause proton elimination.In the so-called "non-living" polymerization systems, high molecular weight polyisobutylenes are prepared practically only at low temperatures (-60 to -100° C) and at catalyst concentrations exceeding one
