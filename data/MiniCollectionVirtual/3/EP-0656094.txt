<ABSTRACT>
A phase change mechanism is described for varying the phase of an engine camshaft relative to the engine crankshaft. The mechanism comprises a drive member (10) to be connected to the camshaft drive, a driven member (14) to be connected to the camshaft, an eccentric (20) mounted for rotation about the axis of the camshaft, a coupling element (18) mounted about the eccentric and acting to transmit torque from the drive member to the driven member, and drive means (22) for rotating the eccentric to move the coupling element (18) relative to the drive and driven members (10, 14) and thereby vary the phase between the drive and driven members. To reduce noise caused by chattering of the coupling element (18) about the eccentric (20), means such as springs (19, 19') are provided for applying a constant additional force to the coupling element while the phase change mechanism is in rotation, the force acting in a direction transverse to the line of action of the reaction force reversals acting on the eccentric (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a phase change mechanism for 
varying the phase of an engine camshaft relative the engine 
crankshaft, comprising a drive member to be connected to the 
camshaft drive, a driven member to be connected to the 
camshaft, an eccentric mounted for rotation about the axis 
of the camshaft, a coupling element mounted about the 
eccentric and acting to transmit torque from the drive 
member to the driven member, and means for rotating the 
eccentric to move the coupling element relative to the drive 
and driven members and thereby vary the phase between the 
drive and driven members. The optimum times for opening and closing the inlet and 
exhaust valves in an internal combustion engine vary with 
operating parameters such as engine load and speed. In any 
engine with fixed angles for opening and closing the valves 
for all engine operating conditions, the valve timing is a 
compromise which detracts from the engine efficiency in all 
but a limited range of operating conditions. For this 
reason, control systems have been proposed which vary the 
valve timing during engine operation. Numerous phase change mechanisms are described in the prior 
art using a wide variety of techniques and principles. A 
mechanism which bears a close resemblance to that of the 
present invention is that described in the Applicants' own 
earlier PCT Patent Publication No. WO90/10788. This publication discloses a phase change mechanism for a 
camshaft of an internal combustion engine, which comprises a 
drive member to be connected by a toothed belt to the  
 
crankshaft, a driven member to be connected to the camshaft 
and a coupling element for transmitting torque from the 
drive member to the driven member. The coupling element is 
connected for rotation with the drive and driven members in 
such a manner that the phase of the driven member relative 
to the drive member depend on the position of the coupling 
element. An inertial member is connected to the coupling 
element by an eccentric crank that causes the coupling 
element to move between two end positions when the inertial 
member rotates relative to the drive and driven members. A further development of the invention in the latter PCT 
application is described in copending British Patent 
Application No. 9213210.9 filed on 20 June, 1992. This 
application describes and claims a phase change mechanism 
for varying the phase of an engine camshaft relative the 
engine crankshaft, comprising a drive member to be connected 
to the camshaft drive, a

<CLAIMS>
A phase change mechanism for varying the phase of an 
engine camshaft relative the engine crankshaft, comprising a 

drive member (10) to be connected to the camshaft drive, a 
driven member (14) to be connected to the camshaft, an 

eccentric (20) mounted for rotation about the axis of the 
camshaft, a coupling element (18) mounted about the 

eccentric (20) and acting on pins (12,16) secured to the 
drive member (10) and driven member (14), respectively, to 

transmit torque from the drive member (10) to the driven 
member (14), and drive means (22) for rotating the eccentric 

to move the coupling element (18) relative to the drive and 
driven members (10,14) and thereby vary the phase between 

the drive and driven members, characterised by noise 
suppression means (19) for constantly applying an additional 

spring or centrifugal force to the coupling element (18) 
during rotation of the phase change mechanism, the force 

acting in a direction parallel to the line extending between 
the centres of the pins (12,16) and serving to maintain the 

same side of the coupling element (18) in constant contact 
with the eccentric (20). 
A phase change mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the drive means for rotating the eccentric comprises a 

one-way clutch (22) acting to permit rotation of the 
eccentric (20) in only one direction, the forces causing the 

rotation of the eccentric (20) being derived from the torque 

reversals acting on the camshaft. 
A phase change mechanism as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the coupling element (18) is made as a single rigid 

component carrying slider blocks (13, 15) journalled on the 
respective pins (12, 16) and slidable in slots formed in the 

coupling element (18).  
 
A phase change mechanism as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the faces of the slider blocks (13,15) in contact with the 

coupling element (18) taper and the sides of the slots in 
the coupling element (18) have a complementary taper.
