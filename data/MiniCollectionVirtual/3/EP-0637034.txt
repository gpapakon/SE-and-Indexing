<ABSTRACT>
A method whereby the N elements (R1, R2, ..., RN) 
of a memory (4) are read sequentially, and the data 

items (D1, D2, ..., DN) contained therein are compared 
with reference data items. Simultaneously with the 

reading of each element of the memory (4), its address 
is written in a number of redundancy check registers 

(7), each connected to a respective redundancy element 
(11). In the event the element of the memory (4) differs 

from the reference data item, the first of the 
redundancy check registers (7) is blocked to prevent it 

from being overwritten and so permanently memorize the 
address of a faulty element of the memory (4). Upon the 

entire memory (4) being read, the addresses of any 
faulty elements in the memory (4) are thus already 

memorized in the redundancy check registers (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
detecting faulty elements of a redundancy semiconductor
memory.Electronic semiconductor memories are known to be
formed of a number of memory cells arranged in an array
of n rows and m columns.In the case of redundancy memories, test machines
for sequentially checking the base elements (rows and/or
columns) are employed for detecting any faulty elements
and replacing them with auxiliary ones.The test devices provide for performing the
following operations:
sequentially reading the memory cells:comparing the read and expected values, and
memorizing the addresses of the faulty cells;locating the elements (rows and/or columns)
containing faulty cells;determining the auxiliary elements with which to
replace the faulty elements; and writing the faulty element addresses in
nonvolatile redundancy check registers.The methods employed on known test machines,
particularly for sequentially reading the memory
elements and writing the faulty element addresses in the
nonvolatile check registers, are fairly complex,
time-consuming, and require either a dedicated external
test machine or additional external hardware.A method of the type defined in the preamble of claim 1 is
disclosed in IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 27,
no. 11, November 1992, p. 1525-1531, wherein, during a
test-and-repair cycle, the address of the element to be
read is stored in the address buffer of the memory and, if
a faulty cell is detected, the faulty cell address is sent
from the address buffer to a fail address memory for the
use during the normal read/write operations in combination
with a spare memory. This method thus shares the same above
discussed drawbacks.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a method usable on a simplified test machine,
and which provides for straightforward, rapid detection
of faulty memory elements.According to the present invention, there is
provided a method for detecting faulty memory elements,
as claimed in Claim 1.A preferred non-limiting embodiment of the present
invention will be described by way of example with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig.1 shows a schematic view of a memory including
a test machine implementing the method according to the
present invention;Fig.2 shows a logic block diagram of the steps of
the method according to the present invention.Number 1 in Fig.1 indicates an electronic device
comprising both memory elements and elements for
implementing the method according to the present
invention.Device

<CLAIMS>
A method of detecting faulty elements of a redundancy
semiconductor memory, comprising the steps of:


a) reading (110) a data item stored in an element (R1,
R2, ..., RN) of main memory means (4);
b) temporarily storing the address (I1, I2, ..., IN) of
said element (R1, R2, ..., RN) in at least one control

memory location forming part of accessory memory means (7);
c) comparing (130) said stored data item with a
reference data item;
d) generating (170) a faulty element signal, in the
event said stored data item differs from said reference data

item; and
e) repeating steps a)-d) for all the elements of said
main memory means (4);
f) memorizing (165) said addresses (I1, I2, ..., IN) of said read elements in memory locations of a fail address memory (12);

characterizing in that, in said step b), the temporarily
storing is made into a memory location forming part of a

number of memory registers (7);

in that, in step f), the memorizing is made into permanent
memory locations; and
in that said step d) for generating a faulty element signal
comprises the step of associating said address (I1, I2, ...,

IN) of said faulty element with a code (REDENO) for
subsequently disabling writing of said memory register (7)

containing said address.
A method as claimed in
Claim 1, characterized in that said

code (REDENO) is generated for disabling said element of
said main memory means (4) and enabling an element of redundancy

memory means (11).
A method as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that said steps a) b)

of reading a stored data item and temporarily storing
the address are performed simultaneously.
A method as claimed in any one of
Claims 2-3, characterized in that said element of

said redundancy memory means (11) is a row.
A method as claimed in any one of
Claims 2-3, characterized in that said

element of said redundancy memory means (11) is a
column.
A method as claimed in
Claim 2, characterized in that said elements of said redundancy

memory means (11) comprise rows and columns.
