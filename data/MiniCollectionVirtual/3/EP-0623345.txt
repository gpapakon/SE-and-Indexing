<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new salts of morphine,
for use as analgesic medicament for relief of pain through
electromotive administration.Morphine is the first opioid drug to have been isolated
in pure forme and is used clinically as drug to achieve
relief of nocioceptive pain, too severe to be controlled by
peripheral analgesics such as the salicylates. Morphine with
a pKa of 8.2 units, is strongly ionised at a normal blood pH
of 7.4 units and has a low lipid solubility. Therefore this
drug is slow to enter the CNS, a fact that is readily
verified by having to wait at least 10 minutes after an iv
bolus injection to observe maximum respiratory depression.With detailed pharmacological understanding of agonism-antagonism
actions at CNS receptor sites as yet very
limited, morphine remains the "gold standard" for assessing
the efficacy of all other opioid drugs. It is familiar to
physicians the world over, very inexpensive and, given in
correct dosages for different painful conditions, always
exerts a beneficial therapeutic effect with small chance of
inducing psychological dependence.Morphine base is soluble 1/5000 in water and 1/250
ethanol, thus necessitating ionised formulations for aqueous
injections of reasonably small volumes. Two ionised forms,
morphine sulphate and morphine hydrochloride, are available
for clinical use in most countries. Both formulations are
soluble in water, 1/20-25, and their main physical
difference is in their solubilities in ethanol, 1/1000 and 
1/50, respectively. Many other derivatives of morphine have
been synthesised and these include: morphine - hydrobromide;
methyl bromide; oxide; nitrate; monobasic phosphate;
acetate; lactate; meconate; tartrate; valerate; 6-methylether;
oleate; hyperduric; ester-nicotinate and
hydrochloride - nicotinate. They proved however to be of
little clinical utility.Of the oral formulations of morphine available, slow-release
morphine sulphate has proven particularly valuable
in the long term management of cancer pain, although the
dose must be adjusted to allow for the 60-70% to be
metabolised in the intestinal wall and liver before it ever
reaches the systemic circulation and hence the CNS.Parenteral formulations of morphine are used when oral
administration of this agent is presumed ineffectual,
classically in post-operative situations. Effective though
routine intermittent injections are, they have their
disadvantages: blood levels of morphine assume a compound
sine-wave shape and, depending upon the frequency and dose
of the

A formulation of morphine according to claim 1
for use through electromotive administration.
A formulation according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said
cation is selected from sodium and potassium ions.
A formulation according to any one of claims 1 to 3
comprising a morphine citrate selected from trimorphine

citrate, morphine disodium citrate, dimorphine sodium
