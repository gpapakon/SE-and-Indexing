<ABSTRACT>
Processor architecture comprising a central processing unit CPU (2, 4), a program memory (1) and a data memory (3), the central processing unit being functionally composed of a program execution portion (1, 2) and a data processing portion (4), characterised in that, in order to reduce the number of components participating in the constitution of the processor, at least one element (6, 11, 12) of the program execution portion (1, 2) is disposed in the data processing portion (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns processors, and it relates
more particularly to a processor especially adapted to
applications of digital telephony.A certain number of applications of digital telephony use a
complete standard, ADPCM G721 for voice encoding/decoding. A
digital signal processor, DSP, Standard, such as TMS320C25
requires 1300 cycles for sampling at 8 kHz (10.4 Mips).The invention envisions creating a new architecture, BBSP,
for a broadband signal processor, optimized to reduce, on the one
hand, the number of cycles to below 1000 and energy consumption
on the other. The list of operations to be performed in the G721
standard are shown in Table I. 
FUNCTIONSNUMBERAdd/subtract122AND65Preshift, right53Preshift, left46Test bit372-complement24Dynamic shift22Normalization12XOR11MPY 6*68Post-shift11MPY 13*71Shift unit: the preshift, postshift, and normalization
functions represent 144 operations out of 415.The shift value varies from 1 to 15 bits to the right or
left. Immediate or calculated values are used at the time.Test bit: The G721 standard is characterized by a number of
indications of conditional inclusion access, where the result of
the test defines execution of one or more groups of actions.Multiplier: The G721 standard requires a multiplication
function. The TMS320C25, likewise with a multiplier, is not
acceptable from the point of view of economy. The Booth
algorithm, with the technique of shifting and addition, is more
suitable, and only reduces processor performance by 3%. ALU: a 16-bit ALU arithmetic and logic unit is necessary.Command: A subroutine of G721 requires specific
functionality in order to reduce the cycle count and the
dissipation of energy, such as a block of repetitive
instructions, retarded ramification and return, a normalization
block, and others.The structures of existing processors do not have these
capacities and cannot perform efficiently: shifts,
normalization, conditional execution, low-cost multiplication in
a 16-bit data path.The broadband signal processor (BBSP) uses a Harvard
architecture, modified to improve speed and flexibility.In a Harvard architecture, the program and data memories are
located in two separate places, permitting total recovery from
the call and execution of instructions.The invention envisions creating a processor architecture
that has the performance indicated above while staying at a
moderate cost price. The article in the 1982 AFRIPS Conference proceedings at
pages 87-93 discloses a Harvard architecture single chip
microcomputer

<CLAIMS>
A processor, comprising:

a program memory (1) for storing instructions,
a data memory (3) for storing data to be processed, the
program memory and data memory having different address

spaces,
a central processing unit (4) including an arithmetic
logic unit (17) and a plurality of registers, connected to

the data memory,
a program counter (6) for providing addresses to the
program memory, and
a program controller (2) for receiving instructions from
the program memory specified by the provided addresses to

produce control signals in response to those instructions,

characterised in that
the program counter and at least one other of the said
registers are each selectively connectable to the arithmetic

logic unit as a source register or as a destination register.
A processor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the central
processing unit comprises an incrementing device (11) for

incrementing the program counter.
A processor as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in which
the program counter (6) and the at least one other register

are arranged in a stack (15). 
A processor as claimed in claim 3, comprising a shift
unit (16) connected between the stack of registers (15) and

the arithmetic logic unit (17) permitting a logic or
arithmetic shift to the left or the right of a register

content to be performed before the execution of an operation
on this content by the arithmetic and logic unit(17)
A processor as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the or one of the other registers is a register (X, 25, B,

24) connected to an incrementing device (27, 16) which
functions in parallel with the arithmetic logic unit (17) and

is utilisable as an address register for indirect addressing.
A processor as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the or one of the other registers is a register (20)

connected to receive the result of a leftmost one operation,
and is associated with a leftmost one operating block (21).
A processor as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the or one of the other registers is a Booth shift

multiplication register (M).
A processor as claimed in claim 7, wherein the
multiplication by means of the Booth shift register is

executed by a series of addition/shift instructions (MPY),
the first one (MPY1) of which permits the initialisation of

the multiplication sequence.
A processor as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the or one of the other registers is a status or command

register (SW).
