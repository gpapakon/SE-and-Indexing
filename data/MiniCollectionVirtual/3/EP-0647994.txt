<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a potentially 
inexpensive light source for multi-channel wavelength-division-multiplexed 

(WDM) applications. The high-power 
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from a fiber 

amplifier, which is already in the optical fiber, is 
efficiently divided into many channels using a WDM 

demultiplexer. This "spectrum-sliced" ASE is used as 
light sources for WDM systems rather than several 

wavelength-selected DFB lasers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cost efficient 
spectrum-sliced fiber amplifier light source to be used 
with practical wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) 
systems for both long-distance (∼100 km) and local loop 
applications. Recent achievements in optical amplifiers revitalize 
the practicality of wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) 
systems for both long-distance transmission and local-loop 
applications. However, WDM systems are envisioned to have 
a multiple number of transmitter lasers operating at 
different wavelengths. Thus, these transmitter lasers 
should be wavelength-selected for each channel and 
controlled to operate at a specific wavelength to the end 
of a system's lifetime. However, this process would 
increase cost and complexity. There have been a few attempts to overcome this 
problem by using broadband light sources. For example, 
the broadband light from 1.3-µm light emitting diodes 
(LEDs) or superluminescent diodes (SLDs) was "spectrum-sliced" 
using grating-based demultiplexers and used in WDM 
systems. Thus, there was no need for wavelength-selecting 
transmitter lasers and identical LEDs were used for every 
channel. However, the transmission rates were limited to 
2 Mb/s - 150 Mb/s over the distances less than 7 km due to 
the insufficient power inherent in LEDs. Recently, the 
transmission distance has been extended to 110 km at 140 
Mb/s using 1.5-µm SLDs and an erbium-doped fiber amplifier 
(EDFA). M.H. Reeve, A.R. Hunwicks, W. Zhao, S.G. Methley, L.
