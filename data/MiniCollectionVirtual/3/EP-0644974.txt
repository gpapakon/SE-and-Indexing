Locking system consisting of lock and several keys, in 
which locking of the lock, which is determined by 

magnetically advanced tumblers (14), is variable such that 
the locking code of the lock initially corresponding to the 

coding of the first key can be altered to the coding of a 
secondary key by transfer of at least one tumbler member 

(14) within the lock, wherein the coding is formed by 
individual permanent magnets which are arranged in openings 

of a slide (10) and can be lifted out relative to a locking 
plate (11) by means of suitably positioned magnetisation 

zones of a key (5) which can be brought into a position 
parallel to the slide, whereupon the slide (10) can be 

displaced into a 'lock open' position, wherein some of the 
permanent magnets are provided as recoding magnets (42), 

characterised in that the tumbler member (33, 33′) is 
designed as a shift portion (33) associated with the 

recoding magnet (42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49) and arranged 
separately from the slide, such that the tumbler inlet 

opening (40, 50, 51) for the recoding magnet can be 
displaced out of the position of alignment with the 

recoding magnet. 
Lock according to claim 1, characterised in that a shift 
portion (33′) has several tumbler inlet openings (50, 51) 

of different diameter and/or depth. 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that at least one recoding magnet (46) 

corresponds in its length to the thickness of the slide 
(10) and, on abutment against the broad face of the shift 

portion (33), is lifted out of its locking position 
relative to the locking plate (11). 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the shift portion (33, 33′) is  

 
designed as a rotary disc and can be shifted by an angle of 

rotation by means of a tool (39) which can be passed 
through the bottom surface (7′) of the lock housing (6).
