<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video signal follow-up
processing apparatus.As an apparatus for tracking changes of position of
a subject in the field of view, there is a subject
tracking apparatus in a video camera which automatically
tracks the subject according to its movement. First,
for a subject tracking device in a conventional video
camera, an automatic subject tracking method has been
disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application No.
207107/1992 filed on July 10, 1992, which stores a peak
value of high-frequency components of brightness signals
in a measurement frame, and automatically tracks its
movement as characteristics of the subject.Secondly, an automatic subject tracking method has
been disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application No.
322652/1992 filed on November 7, 1992, which performs
automatic tracking by forming a motion vector through
matching of representative points for brightness signals
of front and back fields in a measurement frame, and by
assuming the motion vector as the movement of the
subject.The first automatic tracking method basically
utilizes signals at peak, so that it is vulnerable to
noise. Therefore the automatic tracking may not be
attained in a shooting environment with low illuminance.
Moreover, in principle, it extracts high-frequency 
components, so that the automatic tracking may not be
attained for a subject with low contrast.Furthermore, in the second automatic tracking method,
it is difficult to determine whether the calculated motion
vector is caused by movement of the hand on the video
camera or by movement of the subject, so that a malfunction
may arise in the practical use.US Patent US-A-4 364 089 discloses follow-up
processing apparatus according to the pre-characterising
part of Claim 1 hereof.US-A-5 031 049 contains a disclosure of further
information relevant to the technological background of the
present invention.The present invention provides a video signal follow-up
processing apparatus as set forth in Claim 1.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention
described below there is provided a video signal follow-up
processing apparatus or system, comprising (where the
following reference signs cross-refer to the detailed
description hereinbelow and should not be construed as
