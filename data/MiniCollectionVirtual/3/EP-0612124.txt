<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector system is provided for 
electrically coupling a plurality of conductors (14, 16) 

with a printed circuit board (18). The system includes a 
main housing (12) for mounting on one side of the printed 

circuit board, the board having an IC chip (52) on the 
opposite side thereof. Main terminals are mounted on the 

main housing for coupling the conductors to circuits of the 
printed circuit board. A unitary secondary housing (34) is 

adapted for mounting on the opposite side of the printed 
circuit board (18) and includes an integral shield portion 

(58) for covering the IC chip (52) and providing 
electrostatic discharge protection therefor. Apertures 

(56) are provided in the shield portion to allow for 
cooling of the IC chip. The unitary secondary housing (34) 

includes at least one integral header portion (40) defining 
a receptacle (42, 44) for receiving a complementary 

electrical connector (30, 32). Terminals are mounted in 
the secondary housing and have contact means (50a) located 

in the receptacle for interengagement with contacts of the 
complementary electrical connector and tails (50b) for 

interengagement with circuit traces on the printed circuit 
board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an input-output
electrical connector for electrically coupling a plurality
of conductors with an electronic component or device, and
including header connector receptacles.There are many applications in the electronic
industry, such as in copying machines, computers and the
like, wherein a plurality of conductors must be terminated
to various electronic components to carry out various
functions of a machine or apparatus. For instance, in a
copying machine, control electronics are fed through data
conductors or lines and power conductors or lines to
various devices, such as motors, audible or visual
indicators, or the like which perform the various functions
of the machine, such as changing the reduction of -the
copying process, varying the numbers of copies, rendering
audible or visual signals, and the like. Electronic
components or devices, such as printed circuit boards,
integrated circuit chips, headers or connectors must be
coupled through electrical connectors to the power and data
transmission conductors or lines.An electronic system of the character described
above is shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,125,846 to Sampson et
al, dated June 30, 1992 and assigned the assignee of this
invention. In that patent, a plurality of conductors are
coupled to a printed circuit board. The board, itself, has
an integrated circuit chip (IC chip) and a plurality of 
separate header connectors mounted thereon. The header
connectors have terminal pins interconnected to circuit
traces on the printed circuit board. In essence, the
header connectors are separate connector devices, and the
IC chip is exposed on top of the printed circuit board
between the header connectors.This invention is directed to an improved
electronic system of the character described above and as
generally shown in the 5,125,846 patent, but which includes
a multi-purpose upper or secondary housing which forms a
plurality of header connectors on the printed circuit
board, along with means for shielding the IC chip on the
board from electrostatic discharge while affording cooling
of the IC chip and, in one embodiment, affording
deformation of the terminals of the header connectors from
outside the housing.An object, therefore, of the invention is to
provide a new and improved input-output electrical
connector system of the character described.In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, an
electrical connector system is provided for electrically
coupling a
