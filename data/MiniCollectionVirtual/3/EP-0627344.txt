<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a belt retractor for safety belt restraining systems in vehicles, having a helical retraction spring (16) which has a radially internal spring connection to the shaft (12) of the belt reel and a radially external spring connection to a connecting part (18) which is fixed to the casing. A cylindrical part (141) of a cartridge (14) surrounds the retraction spring (16). According to the invention, the shaft (12) is arranged, together with the internal spring connection, eccentrically with respect to the cylindrical part (141) of the cartridge (14) in such a way that when the belt is wound up, the outside circumference of the retraction spring (16) is situated in the cylindrical part (141) of the cartridge (14) in an essentially concentric manner.

A belt retractor for vehicular seat belt restraining 
systems having a spiral retraction spring (16) including a 

radially inner spring connection on the shaft (12) of the 
belt reel and a radially outer spring connection on a 

connecting part (18) firmly connected to the housing, and a 
cassette (14) surrounding the retraction spring (16) with a 

cylindrical part (141), 
characterized by
 the shaft (12) with 
the inner spring connection being eccentrically disposed 

with respect to the cylindrical part (141) of the cassette 
(14) in such a manner that, when the belt webbing is fully 

coiled, the outer circumference of the retraction spring 
(16) is disposed substantially concentric in the cylindrical 

part (141) of the cassette (14). 
A belt retractor according to claim 1 
characterized by
 
the shaft (12) together with the inner spring connection 

being offset from the center point (C) of the cassette 
(14) in a direction which - when the belt webbing is fully 

coiled - is substantially perpendicular to the tangent on 
the outer winding of the retraction spring (16) at the point 

of run-out towards the connection part (18) firmly connected 
to the frame.  

 
A belt retractor according to claim 1 or 2 
characterized 
by
 the inner diameter of the casette (14) being not more 
than approx. 50 mm for a coilable belt length of 2100 mm. 
A belt retractor according to claim 2 and 3 
characterized 
by
 the dimension of the offset of the shaft (12) with 
respect to the inner spring connection being approx. 5 to 

10 mm. 
A belt retractor according to any of the preceding claims 

characterized by
 the radius of the tensioned retraction 
spring (16) being essentially the same as the shortest 

distance of the shaft (12) from the shell of the cassette 
(14). 
A belt retractor according to any of the preceding claims 
2 to 5 
characterized by
 the distance between the base 
mounting fixture (101) of the retractor housing (10) and the 

cassette (14) being approx. 0,20 mm. 
A belt retractor according to any of the preceding claims 

characterized by
 the outer winding of the retraction spring 
(16) not being supported at the inside of the cassette (14) 

when the webbing is at least substantially fully coiled-up.
