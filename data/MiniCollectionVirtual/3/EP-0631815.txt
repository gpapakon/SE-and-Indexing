<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a reinforced converter body, 
especially one useful as a "light-off" converter in a gas 

treating system for treating exhaust gas from internal combustion 
engines. The invention utilizes corrugated and flat thin metal 

strips in alternating relation. Reinforcement is enhanced by the 
use of thin metal strips of a stronger alloy for at least a part 

of the thin metal strips.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a converter body useful for
altering the chemical composition of a fluid, particularly a gas.
More particularly, the invention in its specific applications,
relates to a converter for altering the chemical composition of
exhaust gas from an engine, e.g., an internal combustion engine,
to remove pollutant material therefrom prior to its entry into
the atmosphere.The invention is especially concerned with a metal
monolith converter useful in a combined electrically heatable
catalytic converter and a "light-off" converter. The metal
monoliths hereof may be used alone in the exhaust lines of small
engines, e.g., motor cycles, lawn mowers or boat engines,
Exhaust gas, for example, passes through an electrically heated
converter unit to elevate its temperature to the point where, in
the presence of a catalyst, pollutant material contained therein
is converted to harmless gas prior to passage into the
atmosphere.The converter bodies of the present invention are
particularly useful as a component of a catalytic converter
system for automotive vehicles which treats pollutant-laden
exhaust gases in such a way as to reduce exhaust pollutants to an 
acceptable level. While the following discussion will be limited
to catalytic converters for vehicles, it will be understood that
the principles hereof apply to stationary as well as mobile
devices, and to chemical reactors other than converters for
exhaust gas pollutants.The purpose of a catalytic converter for an internal
combustion engine, or a gas turbine, is to convert pollutant
materials in the exhaust, e.g., carbon monoxide, unburned
hydrocarbons or nitrogen oxides, to carbon dioxide, nitrogen
and water prior to discharge into the atmosphere. Conversion to
such relatively harmless by-products is not efficient initially
when the exhaust gases are relatively cold, e.g., at cold engine
start. To be effective at a high conversion rate, the catalyst
and surface of the converter which the gases contact must be at
or above a minimum temperature, e.g., 199°C (390 F) for carbon
monoxide,
299°C (570 F) for volatile organic compounds, and about 482°C (900 F)
for methane
or natural gas. Otherwise, conversion to harmless by-products is
poor and cold start pollution is high.To achieve initial heating of the catalyst at engine
start-up, there is conveniently provided an electrically heatable
catalytic converter unit, preferably one formed of a thin metal
honeycomb monolith. Recent developments have demonstrated the 
advantage of providing a "cascade"
