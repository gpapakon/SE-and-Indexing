<DESCRIPTION>
This invention belongs to the field of organic 
chemistry. More particularly, it relates to certain 
2,2'-bisacetoacetates which are useful as polymer 
crosslinking agents in thermosetting coating compositions. Polymer crosslinking agents or "crosslinkers" are 
multi-functional molecules capable of reacting with 
pendant functional groups on polymers. The use of 
crosslinkers enable one to increase the molecular weight 
of the polymer, usually in a second step, and thus 
improve the properties of the resulting polymer or 
polymeric film. Most crosslinking reactions are 
initiated by heating a mixture of the polymer and the 
crosslinker either neat or in a solvent. Such systems 
are often referred to as "thermosetting" systems. Crosslinkers are particularly useful in coating 
applications due to the fact that the crosslinker 
enables the use of relatively low molecular weight 
polymers and resins which are easily handled in 
solvents. The formulation can subsequently be applied 
to the substrate and heated, or cured, to give the 
finished (thermoset) coating. This makes it possible to 
take advantage of the ease of handling and solubility 
characteristics of the lower molecular weight resins 
used in the formulation and subsequently develop the 
hardness, chemical and solvent resistance, as well as 
strength/flexibility properties desired in the ultimate  
 
coating by the reaction of the crosslinker with the 
resin during the curing process. Crosslinkers are becoming increasingly important 
due to the emphasis on more environmentally acceptable 
coatings. One major environmental concern in the 
coatings industry is the amount of organic solvent 
released during the curing process. This solvent level 
or Volatile Organic Content (VOC) is of concern due to 
the role of organic solvents in the development of 
photochemical smog. For these reasons various governments, 
including the U.S., are regulating the VOC levels 
of coating formulations. One way to reduce the amount 
of solvent necessary in a coating formulation is to 
reduce the molecular weight of the resin backbone used 
in the formulation. When this approach is used, however, 
crosslinking becomes even more critical to the 
development of the ultimate properties in the cured 
film. Thus in these applications the crosslinker 
enables a more environmentally sound coating formulation. A number of properties are desired in a coating in 
order to impart the desired protection of the object 
from corrosion and other environmental factors. Some of
