<ABSTRACT>
Gas or liquid hydrocarbon streams containing H₂S 
and/or mercaptans are treated with a scavenging compound 

comprising a 1,3,5-trimethyl-hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine, 
which is substantially free of formaldehyde and preferably 

prepared by the reaction of methylamine and formaldehyde.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the treatment of sour 
gas and liquid hydrocarbon streams to remove or reduce the 
levels of hydrogen sulfide therein. In one aspect, the 
invention relates to the treatment of sour gas and oil streams 
flowing in a flow line. In another aspect, the invention 
relates to the use of nonregenerative scavengers to reduce the 
levels of hydrogen sulfide in natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon 
streams. The toxicity of hydrogen sulfide in hydrocarbon streams 
is well known in the industry and considerable expense and 
efforts are expended annually to reduce its content to a safe 
level. Many regulations require pipeline gas to contain no 
more than 4 ppm hydrogen sulfide. In large production facilities, it is generally more 
economical to install a regenerative system for treating sour 
gas streams. These systems typically employ a compound used 
in an absorption tower to contact the produced fluids and 
selectively absorb the hydrogen sulfide and possibly other 
toxic materials such as carbon dioxide and mercaptans. The 
absorption compound is then regenerated and reused in the 
system. Typical hydrogen sulfide absorption materials include 
alkanolamines, PEG, hindered amines, and the like.  However, during a development stage of a field or in 
small producing fields where regenerative systems are not 
economical, it is necessary to treat the sour hydrocarbon 
production with nonregenerative scavengers. Based on an article appearing in the Oil & Gas Journal, 
January 30, 1989, nonregenerative scavengers for small plant 
hydrogen sulfide removal fall into four groups: aldehyde 
based, metallic oxide based, caustic based, and other processes. 
In the removal of hydrogen sulfide by nonregenerative 
compounds, the scavenger reacts with the hydrogen 
sulfide to form a nontoxic compound or a compound which can 
be removed from the hydrocarbon. For example, in the formaldehyde 
type reaction, the reaction produces a chemical complex 
known as formthionals (e.g., trithiane). As described in detail below, the present invention 
employs a nonregenerative scavenger which may be of the 
aldehyde type. These include low molecular weight aldehydes 
and ketones and adducts thereof. The low molecular weight 
aldehydes may also be combined with an alkyl or alkanolamine 
as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,748,011. Other aldehyde derived 
scavengers include the reaction product of low molecular 
weight alkanolamines and aldehydes disclosed in U.S. Patent 
4,978,512. In accordance with the method
