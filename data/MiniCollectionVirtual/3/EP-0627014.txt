<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for recovering non-ferrous metal from a dross starting material containing this metal, optionally together with non-ferrous metal scrap, and/or a starting material comprised of such scrap. The method comprises introducing the starting material into a rotary furnace or rotatable converter provided with a refractory lining, heating the starting material to a temperature above the melting point of the metal while rotating the furnace either continuously or intermittently, and removing the resultant molten metal from beneath the overlying dross residues. The method is characterized by heating the starting material in the absence of a protective salt layer with the aid of a so-called oxy-fuel-burner which is supplied with a fossil fuel and with a gas that contains at least 80 % oxygen, and by rotating the furnace at a speed of 5 r.p.m or lower.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of recov
ering aluminum from a dross starting material which
contains aluminum or an aluminum alloy, said method
comprising the steps of feeding the starting material to
a rotary furnace or a rotatable converter provided with
a refractory lining, heating the starting material to a term
perature above the melting point of the aluminum while
rotating the furnace continuously or intermittently, and
removing the resultant molten aluminum from remaining
dross residues and/or from resultant solid dross residues.Methods for recovering aluminum from dross are
known to the art. For example, the Canadian Patent
Specification 1,255,914 and the corresponding EP-A-322
207 teache a method for recovering non-ferrous
metal from non-ferrous-metal containing dross, comprising
the steps of feeding the dross into a rotary furnace
which has a refractory lining, directing a plasma
burner into the furnace so as to heat the dross to a temperature
above the melting point of the metal, rotating
the furnace either continuously or intermittently, and removing
the molten, separated metal from the solid dross
residue.A method of producing aluminum alloy from scrap
aluminum is described in US-A-3759702. This reference
teaches melting of aluminum scrap in a forehearth
in an unconfined atmosphere with a non-oxidizing oxy-fuel
flame in order to speed up and intensify heating. No
salt bath is applied.it is also known to recover non-ferrous metals from
dross and metal waste with the aid of oxy-fuel-burners
while using a protective layer of salts. This layer may
Include sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride
(KCl) in roughly equal quantities with respect to weight,
and may also contain a flux, for instance cryolite. The
effect of the salt layer on the coalescence of aluminum
droplets when treating aluminum dross is described, for
instance, in the Second international Symposium; Recycling
of metals and engineered materials, The minerals,
metals and materials Society, 1990, pages 69-84,
by Ray D. Petersen, entitled "Effect of salt flux additives
on aluminum droplet coalescence". In an article entitled
"Interfacial phenomena in molten aluminum and salt
systems" published in the same reference, pages
85-103, Francis K. Ho and Yogesh Sahai describe the
remelting of aluminum waste beneath a salt layer.An object of the present invention is to recover, or
win, aluminum metal from a dross starting material
which contains aluminum or an aluminum alloy, with the
aid of an oxy-fuel-burner and in the

<CLAIMS>
A method of recovering aluminum metal from a dross
starting material

which form on the surface of molten aluminium

or an aluminium alloy during melting, molding and
handling operations and which contains aluminum or an aluminum alloy,

said method comprising the steps of introducing the starting
material into a rotary furnace or a rotatable converter having

a refractory lining, heating the starting material to a temperature
above the melting point of the aluminum while rotating

the furnace continuously or intermittently at a speed of 5 rpm,
or lower, and removing the resultant molten aluminum from the

overlying residue, wherein the step of heating the starting
material is performed in the absence of a protective salt layer

with an oxy-fuel-burner which is operated with a fossil fuel
and with a gas that contains at least 80% oxygen, wherein

the oxy-fuel-burner is supplied, with fuel and
oxygen in stoichiometric relationships, or in a relationship in

which oxygen is present in an amount which at most 20% below the
stochiometric amount, when delivering heat to the furnace

burden. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized by

lowering the power output of the burner to 50-10%
of its earlier value and increasing the rotational

speed of the furnace to 5-25 rpm and continuing the
supply of energy until the aluminum has melted,

subsequent to having reached atemperature above
the melting point of said aluminum.
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterized by

supplying heat at said reduced power intermittently
during the continued rotation of the furnace at a

speed of 5-25 rpm; and by introducing an inert gas
into the furnace, either through the burner or

through a lance, during a period of interrupted heat
supply.
A method according to Claim 3, 
characterired in

that the inert gas is argon.
A method according to one or more of Claims 1-4.

characterized by
 maintaining an overpressure of
combustion gases in the rotary furnace or converter.
A method according to one or more of Claims 1-5,

characterized by
 terminating the heating process
and tapping aluminum from the furnace or converter

when the temperature of the metal lies within the
range of 750-950Â°C.
A method according to one or more of Claims 2-5,

characterized by
 terminating the heating process
and tapping aluminum from the furnace or the converter

after a time lapse of 5-60 minutes from the
time of increasing the rotational speed of said furnace

or converter.
