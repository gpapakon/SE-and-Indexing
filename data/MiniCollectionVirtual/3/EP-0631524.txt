<ABSTRACT>
The inventive structure involves the provision and use of a rotating, fluted, impeller (11) having sling compartments along a side thereof in which frangible materials are progressively introduced, are subjected to impaction with respect to each other and from which, after a build-up of radial angular velocity of the bodies, are projected forwardly radially outwardly with maximized face against a striker abutment (17) and each other within a side-positioned quadrant zone. Thereafter, the broken-up material bodies are advanced past a somewhat tangentially converging forward, space-restricting end of an adjustment plate (17a) which may be one member of a striker abutment assembly, by the impeller into a separating zone of passageway along which a fluid stream is counterflowed with respect to rotation of the impeller and employed to substantially immediately separate out broken-up particulates of a desired size from particles of greater than the desired size, with particles being returned to the impeller compartments and recycled with newly introduced material bodies and with the particulates being carried out of the apparatus by the fluid stream. The shaft (13) of the impeller (11) has a balanced, two-way, supporting, working area isolated, bearing mounting.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCEDURE AND APPARATUS FOR COMMINUTING HARD MATERIAL BODIESThis invention pertains to a simplified and improved approach to disintegrating relatively hard but breakable material bodies. A highly efficient procedure is involved as carried out by the development and use of a machine having a relatively low auditory type of operation. The material bodies processed may be in the nature of brittle or frangible hard materials, such as lump coal, limestone, cement clinkers, metal ores, slag-like and frozen bodies.Background of the InventionIn the prior art, the conventional procedure has been to use ball milling, stamping, crushing, and grinding operations for breaking up ore-like bodies. This involves, not only a highly objectionable raising of the environmental noise level, but also a great amount of wear and tear on the apparatus and its working parts. Ball milling also tends to produce rounded particles. Accurate and close size selection has been difficult to attain.Other, more exotic apparatus has employed sudden air pressure changes, with or without a gravity or vacuum induced flow, various fluid utilizing operations, and the directing of the materials against an obstruction with high velocity jets, the exploding or bursting of brittle material by sudden changes of pressure, and so forth. 

Obiects of the InventionAn object of the invention has been to devise a new, simplified and more efficient comminuting procedure and apparatus that will enable an effective breaking-up of material bodies substantially along their cleavage lines and that will eliminate disadvantageous features of prior procedures and apparatus.Another object has been to devise a comminuting procedure and apparatus that will enable the breaking-up or fracturing of material bodies into particles and particulates along their natural cleavage lines, and an efficient and substantially immediate classification of resultant particulates and particles within the same apparatus, with the recycling of larger rejected particles, all as a continuous operation.A further object has been to devise a relatively simple comminuting apparatus construction and operation which will substantially eliminate the sound effects of normal grinding, hammer ill and like operations and which, in turn, indicates a substantially minimized wear and tear on the working parts of the apparatus.A further object has been to employ an outflowing fluid stream for separating out and removing material particulates of a selected smaller size range from a countermoving flow of
