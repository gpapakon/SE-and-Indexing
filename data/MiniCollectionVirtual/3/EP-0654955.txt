<ABSTRACT>
A pre-recorded test tape or test disk which is used to isolate 
unwanted buzzes in an audio listening environment. The prerecording is a 

series of varying amplitude frequency sweeps. The frequency sweeps from the 
audible range of 20Hz. to 400Hz., while the amplitude level is set at five 

different levels. The amplitude of the first sweep is set to the maximum 
output of the audio system which will give a clean 400 Hz. pre-recorded pallet 

tone. Each subsequent sweep is 6 dB down from the previous sweep.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to use of tones to isolate unwanted 
buzzes in an audio listening environment. The present invention also relates 
to pre-recorded test tapes to produce such tones. Loudspeakers create sympathetic vibrations in neighboring items. 
This phenomenon is like the sympathetic vibrations induced in a piano string 
by a tuning fork. The sympathetic vibrations within a audio listening 
environment are often heard as buzzes that may either seem random or as 
regular beats in time with musical tones. In a vehicle, such as an automobile, these buzzes are found in trim 
panels, door panels, instrument panels, and windows and the associated 
structures and mechanisms. As audio entertainment systems and communication 
systems become more powerful, the problem is exacerbated. Automotive 
engineers find that designing a buzz-free listening environment is quite a 
challenging endeavor. Conventional designs involve use of stiff structures 
with an abundance of fasteners and vibration dampening and cushioning 
materials. Testing for buzzes has conventionally been carried out by using 
standard listening devices, such as the radio or tape or CD players. The 
automotive engineer simply turns on the radio, perhaps to a loud rock station, 
or the engineer puts on a tape of music with like characteristics. Any buzz 
readily identified is located and corrected. While this technique works to 
some extent for major buzzes, the less discernable buzzes are usually masked 
by tones in the music and voice of regular programming, tapes and recordings.  
 
And while small, frequency sensitive buzzes are difficult to locate, they tend 
to cumulate to bring about a net effect that detracts from the system, both to 
a listeners consciousness and subconsciousness. The problem of the sympathetic buzz is exacerbated with light and 
less expensive (with less materials) automobile as are found in great 
abundance in today's automotive market. An object of the present invention is to provide a prerecorded test 
tap or test disk to be played in an audio testing environment to isolate 
buzzes. In order to achieve the above object, there is provided a 
pre-recorded test tape or test disk which is used to isolate unwanted buzzes 
in an audio listening environment. The recording is a series of varying 
amplitude frequency sweeps. The frequency sweeps from the audible range of 
20Hz. to 400Hz., while the amplitude level is set at five different levels. 
The amplitude of the first sweep is set to the maximum output of the
