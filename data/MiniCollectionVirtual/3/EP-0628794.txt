<ABSTRACT>
A basis weight scanner (12) using a beta-ray source 
(16) and an electron detector (17) on opposite sides of a 

web (10) of wood pulp sheeting is used to calculate the 
weight of wood pulp advanced past a measuring location (e.g. 

into a cellulosic extruded product production plant).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method of and 
apparatus for determining the weight of web material fed to 
a processing station. It is known, in a number of manufacturing processes, to 
use a basis weight scanner to monitor for variations in 
thickness of sheet material passing a monitoring point in a 
manufacturing process. One known form of basis weight 
scanner utilises a beta-particle emitter on one side of the 
moving sheet material and a beta-particle detector on the 
other side of the moving sheet material, the emitter and 
detector being moved together as a pair across a substantial 
part of the width of the sheet material to monitor 
variations in thickness of the sheet material by a sensing 
of real time variations in beta-particle absorption by the 
sheet material. Such a basis weight scanner is used, for example, to 
monitor the output of a sheet extruder in a plastics 
processing plant downstream of an extruding head and, via 
a feedback loop, to adjust the performance of the extruding 
head to maintain substantially uniform product thickness 
across the width of the sheet material. US-A-4845730 discloses equipment for determining the 
content of fillers in paper which equipment uses a beta-ray 
source to evaluate the basis weight of the cellulose in the 
paper but the equipment described is not used to scan across 
the entire width of a web of paper to determine the total 
weight of cellulose as is practised by the present 
invention.  We have now found that a basis weight scanner can be 
used as a flow meter to determine the total weight of sheet 
material fed forward to a subsequent processing plant. Accordingly, in its simplest form, the invention 
relates to the use of a basis weight scanner as a flow 
meter. One particular application of the invention is in the 
monitoring of a pluri-layer web of cellulosic material (e.g. 
wood pulp) to determine, in real time, the total weight of 
cellulosic material passing the basis weight scanner and 
thereby, inter alia, to detect the loss of one layer of such 
material in the pluri-layer web. In its apparatus aspect, the invention comprises means 
to advance a web, a scanning head adapted to sweep across 
the web in a direction transverse to its advance from side 
to side thereof, the scanning head generating a beam capable 
of being attenuated by the layers constituting the web and 
providing a beam-receiving means to determine, in real time, 
the degree of attenuation of the beam by the web, and 
computing means to determine from an
