<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tumbler switch provided with a rocker. The object of the invention is to damp the noise produced by the sudden changeover of the tumbler contacts. This object is achieved essentially in that a stop (21, 22) is provided on the switching rocker (9) itself and holds the sprung operating element (6) of the switch firmly. Advantageous developments of the invention relate to the design of the stop (21, 22) and to a sliding movement, which is made possible by means of the invention, of the moving switching contact (19) with respect to the stationary contact (20), for purposes of contact cleaning.

Toggle switch, wherein a movable contact (9) mounted with
respect to the housing (1) is acted upon by an actuating

element (6) applying a force which has a point of
application (8) displacing along the movable contact (9),

and the movable contact (9) assumes a first stable position
before exceeding the point of support (11) on the housing

and assumes a second stable position after the point of
support (11) has been exceeded,
characterized
 in that the track of motion (18)
for the point of application (8) of the actuating element

(6) on the movable contact in said's longitudinal direction
is so shaped that the movement of the actuating element (6)

is only limited by a stop on the movable contact (9) after
the movable contact (9) has adopted its new stable

position.
Toggle switch as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that for providing the stop
(21), the curved track (18) of the movable contact (9) for

the actuating element is curved so that a force (X) which
limits the movement of the actuating element (6) has a

preferably progressive configuration.
Toggle switch as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized
 in that, in the end position of
the actuating element (6) limited by the stop (21), the

actuating element exerts a force (X) in the longitudinal 
direction of the movable contact (9).
Toggle switch as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized
 in that the movable contact (9)
is mounted in a knife-edge support (11) in the housing (1),

and in that the actuating element (6) is rotatably mounted
with respect to the housing.
Toggle switch as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the movable contact (9)
is floatingly supported relative to the point of support

(11) on the housing, in the longitudinal direction (X) of
the movable contact (9), and in that the support surface

(11) on the housing is arranged in a support element (12)
which additionally provides an electrical connection for

the switch.
Toggle switch as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized
 in that one stop (21, 22) each
is provided in the movable contact (9) for the two end

positions of the movable contact (9).
Toggle switch as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized
 in that the stop (21) is so
configured that a rocker contact (19) attached to the

movable contact (9) is initially seated on the switching
contact (2) of a contact piece on the housing, and 

subsequently the rocker contact (19) is draggingly
displaced over the switching contact (20) by the force (X)

acting in the longitudinal direction of the rocker.
Toggle switch as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized
 in that the actuating element
(6) in its longitudinal direction is resiliently supported

with respect to the movable contact (9).
