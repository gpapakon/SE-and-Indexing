<ABSTRACT>
During a blanking period from the actuation of the motor driving 
to a given time T, the motor current is not compared with its threshold value. 

During the latter stage Tm of the blanking period, a catching of anything 
in the window is detected on the basis of the value of the motor current, 

and after the blanking period, it is detected on the basis of the 
variation of the motor current, thus preventing any misoperation due to 

noise in the initial period of the motor driving, and reliably detecting a 
catching of anything in the window.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for driving and
controlling a power window according to the preamble of claim
1.At a location near the driver's seat, there are provided
manual switches and an auto switch as switches for the power
window.When the auto switch is operated by the driver so that the
contacts for raising operation or the contacts for lowering
operation are brought into the ON state, the drive of the
motor is continued until the door glass is completely closed
or completely opened even after the driver releases the auto
switch. When the door glass is completely closed, the movement
of the door glass is prevented by the window frame or the
like, whereby the drive current of the motor increases. The
drive of the motor is stopped when the drive current exceeds a
predetermined level.By the way, it has been considered to detect an abnormal
current due to the existence of a foreign object on the locus
of the upward movement of the door glass so as to stop or
reverse the motor. In some systems, there is provided a full-closure
detecting switch for detecting the state that the door
glass approaches its full closure position so as to
discriminate a current increase due to the foreign object from
a current increase due to the full closure of the door glass. However, in the case where the detected drive current of the
motor exceeds the predetermined value due to rush current at
the beginning of the drive of the motor, such an increase in
the drive current is sometimes regarded as abnormal current.
To overcome this problem, a blanking period is provided for
stopping the comparison between the variation amount of the
motor current and the predetermined value at the beginning of
the drive of the motor, thereby preventing unnecessary
operations due to the above-described rush current.DE 33 32 813 Al discloses such an apparatus incorporating a
blanking period and provides all features of the preamble of
claim 1.However, the above-described conventional art has a problem
that the catching of a foreign object cannot be detected if
such catching occurs in a predetermined period of time
(blanking period) following the start of the motor. If the
blanking period is shortened considerably, a possibility
arises that the variation amount of the motor current exceeds
the predetermined value due to a variation in current
(especially, an increase in current) which occurs during the
transient period after the flow of rush current has started.In view of the above-described facts, it is an object of the
present
