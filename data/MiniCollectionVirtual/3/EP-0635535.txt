<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing aqueous compositions having high stability based 
on fluoroelastomer usable with conventional painting 
techniques for making protective coatings having high 
resistance and high thickness after only one passage on the 
surface to be coated, generally of metal or rubber. The fluoroelastomers are characterized by an intrinsic 
chemical inertia at high temperatures and therefore are 
broadly usable in fields where a remarkable resistance to 
the chemical agents is required, as for instance in the 
chemical, petrochemical or car industry. The coating with a 
paint based on fluoroelastomer confers to the surface of the 
coated object the same characteristics of resistance to the 
chemical agents as those of the fluoroelastomer itself. Various formulations of fluoroelastomers based on the 
use of a solvent are described in the art. A typical 
formulation comprises the polymer, a solvent, selected 
charges for their reinforcing effect and for their capacity 
of conferring suitable rheological properties to the paint, 
an acceptor of hydrofluoric acid, usually selected from the 
metal oxides, and a crosslinking agent, often as a separate 
component, to develop in the coating good mechanical 
properties. The method of preparing the compositions 
consists in solubilizing the fluoroelastomer and dispersing  
 
in the obtained solution the charges, optionally premilled 
with a part of the solution itself. The formulations of fluoroelastomers based on a solvent 
show various inconveniences. The high dilution of the 
system, bound to the limited solubility of the 
fluoroelastomer in organic solvents (methylethylketone, 
acetone, butyl acetate, tetrahydrofurane) requires the 
application of many layers to obtain a high thickness, of 
about 1 mm, necessary in particular in the anticorrosion 
coatings. This inconvenience is particularly felt 
considering that the spray application of compositions with 
low dry content and high viscosity requires a special 
technique and in any case it does not give a layer having 
thickness higher than 100 Âµm in a single coat. The amount 
of solvent which is required is rather high, around 5 kg per 
1 kg of fluoroelastomer. Moreover the need to solubilize the 
fluoroelastomer in a solvent limits the choice of the 
fluoroelastomer itself to polymers with low molecular 
weight. At last, the "shelf life" and the "pot life" of the 
compositions result rather short, especially in the case of 
bicomponent systems. All these drawbacks
