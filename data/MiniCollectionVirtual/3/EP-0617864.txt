<ABSTRACT>
A system for publishing data (409) on shared broadcast channels using spread-spectrum techniques, which may comprise a spread-spectrum encoder (405) capable of receiving data and placing it in a spread-spectrum signal format (407) and a transmitter (406) operating on a shared communication channel or frequency band, such as might be allocated to terrestrial point-to-point or broadcast communications. The shared communication channel may comprise a cellular system, in which data (409) may be transmitted (406) using spread-spectrum techniques using the transmitters (406) and repeaters of the cellular system simultaneously with voice and other transmissions associated with the cellular system. A subscriber station may be capable of receiving using a plurality of different communication channels or frequency bands, such as a first receiver capable of cellular reception and a second receiver capable of satellite reception, at least one of which uses spread-spectrum techniques. The subscriber station may also comprise a transmitter using at least one communication channel or frequency band, so that the subscriber station may receive data or other transmissions using one channel and may request further data or other transmissions using a second channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for publishing data by broadcast or related technology.
More specifically, this invention relates to a system for publishing data on shared channels using
spread-spectrum techniques.Data publishing is the process of transmitting data to recipients by means of electronic
communication channels, such as broadcast or related communication methods. One motive for
data publishing is that it may be easier or less expensive to transmit data to recipients by means
of broadcast than it would be to write that data onto physical media (such as paper or magnetic
disks or tapes) and carry the physical media to them. Another motive is that the marginal cost of
publishing the same data to an additional recipient may be comparatively small. Data publishing
may be particularly advantageous when the data to be published are voluminous, rapidly
changing, or must be delivered within a short time to be useful. A classic example of such data
is stock-market trading data, although there are many other cases where data publishing would
be advantageous.EPA-0-351-008 is directed to the transmission of two signals on the same channel
Signals from a first source are multiplied with a pseudo-random code to produce a spread
spectrum signal. The spread spectrum signal and a second, modulated signal are combined and
transmitted. The receiver converts the transmitted signal to an IF signal, which is demodulated
to recover the second signal. The IF signal is multiplied with the pseudo-random code used to
encode the first signal, and the result is narrowband filtered to recover the first signal.One problem which has arisen in the art is the lack of sufficient broadcast infrastructure
for data publishing. There are few if any broadcast towers, repeaters, or receivers for use with
data publishing, so it has been generally necessary to use infrastructure which is already
associated with another form of communication. Hence the use of telephone, television, radio
and satellite systems noted above. Accordingly, it 
would be advantageous to provide a method of data publishing which did not require
construction of large amounts of additional infrastructure.Another problem which has arisen in the art is that it may be difficult to obtain sufficient
bandwidth, at reasonable cost and without excessive difficulty, to publish the data. Lack of
bandwidth naturally either reduces the amount of data which can be published, or increases the
amount of time which is required to publish the data to recipients.One method
