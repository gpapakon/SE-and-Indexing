Method of determining a wear-dependent braking 
force distribution (Φ
V
) between braked wheels of a 
vehicle, wear values (t
i
) of brake linings (23/1, 23/2, 
23/3, 23/4) being determined by means of sensors (24, 

25) and signals representing these wear values (t
i
) 
being supplied to a computer device (15, 15/1), the 

wear-dependent braking force distribution (Φ
V
) being 
determined in the computer device (15, 15/1) in such a 

way that a setting signal representing a lower braking 
force is supplied to the brakes exhibiting a wear which 

is too large relative to the others and the individual 
wear values (t
i,old
) of preceding measurements being 
deposited in a memory, characterized in that the determination 

of the wear values (t
i
) and the wear-dependent 
braking force distribution (Φ
V
) takes place at the 
beginning of each journey and the wear-dependent braking 

force distribution (Φ
V
) determined is retained 
during the whole of the journey. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the wear-dependent braking force distribution (Φ
V
) 
determined is additionally deposited in the memory. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that at least one quantity (ddV) representing the 

change in the wear is calculated from the wear values 
(t
i
) determined and from the wear values 
(t
i,old
,d
V,old
) deposited in the memory and in that a 

change in the wear-dependent braking force distribution 
(Φ
V
) relative to the braking force distribution 
(Φ
v,old
) deposited in the memory only takes place when 
the quantity (dd
V
) representing the change in the wear 
exceeds a limiting value (G
V
).  
 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that in the case of a change in the wear-dependent 

braking force distribution (Φ
v
) relative to the braking 
force distribution (Φ
v,old
) deposited in the memory, a 
correction value (d
P
) is determined as a function of 
the quantity (d
V
) representing the change in the wear. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that in the case of at least two changes in the wear-dependent 

braking force distribution (Φ
v
) in the same 
direction within a limited time or within a driving 

performance limit, a signal representing premature 
brake wear or a faulty brake function is generated. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the memory is configured as a long-term memory 

independent of the operation of the vehicle. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the wear-dependent braking force distribution (Φ
v
) 
takes place jointly for the brakes of the wheels of one 

axle (VA,HA). 
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the wear-dependent braking force distribution (Φ
v
) 
takes place between the axles (VA,HA) in such a way 

that the ratio of the wear values (t
i
) at the 
respective axles can be converted by increasing and/or 

reducing to a ratio of natural numbers, of which at 
least one is "one". 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the wear values (t
i
,t
i,old
) determined for the 
individual wheels are deposited in a shift register and 

an average wear (t
i,m
) is calculated from the wear 
values. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the wear-dependent braking force distribution (Φ
v
) 
is superimposed on an optimum-adhesion braking force 

distribution (Φ
adh
). 
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the wear-dependent braking force distribution (Φ
v
) 
is suppressed when the required deceleration value 

(Z
required
), which can be derived from an arbitrarily  
 

actuable braking force pick-up, exceeds a limiting 
value (G
Z
). 
Method according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the limiting value (G
Z
) for the required deceleration 
value corresponds to a full or emergency braking 

action. 
Method according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the limiting value is 0.3 times the gravitational 

acceleration (g). 
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that a limiting value (d
sV
) is specified for the wear-dependent 
braking force distribution in the case of the 

relative wheel rotational speed difference between the 
wheels, the limiting value (d
sV
) being between 1 and 5% 
of the average wheel rotational speed and a dynamic 

correction of the braking force distribution taking 
place when the limiting value (d
sV
) is exceeded. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 10, characterized 
in that an anti-lock braking system is superimposed 

on the wear-dependent braking force distribution 
(Φ
v
).
