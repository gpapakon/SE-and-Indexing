<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reactive armor for military vehicles 
such as tanks and armored personnel carriers. In particular, this 
invention relates to an improved means for protecting the surface area of 
the vehicle from attack and penetration of it's armor by various types of 
anti-armor projectiles. In a military combat environment it is essential for the occupants of 
military vehicles exposed to hostile fire such as modern anti-armor 
projectiles to be afforded protection from the deleterious effects of such 
projectiles when same impact the vehicle. In general there are three types 
of anti-armor projectiles: kinetic energy projectiles, projectiles with 
shaped charge warheads, and projectiles with high explosive warheads.  The kinetic energy projectile consists of a small caliber projectile 
of high density material launched from a gun tube and accelerated to 
supersonic velocity. This type of projectile does not have an explosive 
warhead but due to its high density and speed can easily penetrate 
unprotected armor and cause considerable damage to the vehicle by 
ricocheting off interior walls. In the shaped charge warhead, the 
projectile strikes the exterior armor causing a high explosive charge to 
collapse a metallic liner and form a high speed jet which then penetrates 
even very thick armor. In high explosive warheads, a high explosive charge 
detonates upon impact with the exterior armor causing damage by concussion 
or blast fragmentation. The most effective armor available to defeat shaped charge warheads 
is reactive armor. Reactive armors are armors which contain explosives 
which react in response to the impact of the shaped charge jet, causing 
the jet to dissipate its energy prior to penetration of the hull armor. 
Reactive armor can also be very effective for defeating penetration by 
kinetic energy impact. In this case, the activated armor will throw a  
 
steel plate or some other similar structure, which will deflect or bend 
the penetration rod on impact, and severely degrade its penetration 
performance. The principal type of reactive armor currently available is 
an explosive sandwiched between two plates of inert material. The 
principal drawback of current explosive armor designs is that without 
using elaborate mechanical segmentation barrier installation approaches, a 
single projectile hit anywhere on a vehicle has the potential to deplete a 
large fraction of the active armor protection of that vehicle. This 
depletion can be by either detonation or
