<ABSTRACT>
A matrix of bistable pixels defined by ferroelectric liquid crystal material situated 
at the areas of overlap of row and column electrodes is addressed by blanking the rows 

and subsequently setting selected pixels to the unblanked state row by row by applying 
a select waveform (21) to the relevant row electrode while applying charge-balanced data 

waveforms (35 or 37) in parallel to the column electrodes. One data waveform (35) 
leaves the corresponding pixel in the blanked state while the other (37) switches it to the 

unblanked state. Each data waveform comprises a pair of contiguous pulses (39, 41 or 
45, 47) the transition between which coincides with the start of the select pulse (31). In 

order to prepare each pixel to be switched or non-switches the first pulse (39 or 45) of 
each pair is longer than the select pulse (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of addressing a matrix of bistable pixels which 
are defined by areas of overlap between members of a first set of electrodes on one side 
of a layer of ferroelectric liquid crystal material and members of a second set of 
electrodes, which cross the members of the first set, on the other side of the material, in 
which method, for each electrode of the first set, a blanking signal is applied thereto to 
effect blanking of the corresponding pixels and thereafter a unipolar select pulse of width 
T is applied thereto simultaneously with the application of the second of a pair of 
contiguous pulses to each electrode of the second set, each pair being selected to be 
either of a first kind in which the first pulse is of a first polarity and the second pulse 
is of the opposite polarity and is of length at least T or of a second kind in which the 
first pulse is of the opposite polarity and the second pulse is of the first polarity and is 
of length at least T, so as to effect writing to the corresponding pixels, the select pulses 
being applied to the electrodes of the first set one by one at intervals of nT, where n is 
an integer greater than unity, and the complete waveform applied to each electrode of the 
second set in each interval of length nT the end of which coincides with the end of the 
application of a select pulse to an electrode of the first set being charge-balanced. A method of this general kind for multiplex addressing ferroelectric liquid crystal 
display devices (FLCDs), known as line blanking, is described in EP-A-0479530 and is 
illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 1 of the accompanying drowings. The row 
electrodes of the device (the electrodes of the first set) are scanned in succession at 
intervals of 2T with a "blank" pulse 6 of length 2T, followed after an interval of length 
equal to an integer number times T by a "select" pulse 2 of length T and the opposite 
polarity. A pair 8 or 10 of contiguous pulses is applied to each column electrode 
(electrode of the second set) in conjunction with the application of each select pulse to 
a row electrode, this being done in such manner that the second pulse of the pair is 
applied simultaneously with the corresponding select pulse. The two pulses of each pair 
are each of length T. As will be seen from Fig. 1 the first pulse of pair 8 is of a given 
polarity and the second pulse is of the opposite polarity, whereas the second pulse of pair 
10 is of the given polarity and the first pulse is of the

A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein n is equal to four, and the first pulse 
of each pair of contiguous pulses is of length 2T and is preceded by a further pulse 

which is contiguous with that first pulse, which has an opposite polarity to that first 
pulse, and which has a length of at least T. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the first set of electrodes has n

unipolar and is a pulse of length 2T, and wherein each select pulse is of the opposite 
polarity to the blanking pulse which precedes it on the same electrode of the first set and 

follows the start of that blanking pulse after an interval (2m + 1)T.
