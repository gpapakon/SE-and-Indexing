<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to psyllium-containing drink mix 
compositions comprising acid and base at a level whereby the composition, 
when combined with water, has a pH of from 5,0 to 8,0. 
These compositions have little or no flavor impact, to the extent that 
consumers consider them unflavored, but in spite of the elevated pH 
still have reduced gellation rates. Products containing larger particle size psyllium seed husk with 
citric acid and carbonate salts (e.g., potassium bicarbonate; sodium 
bicarbonate; and/or calcium carbonate) are known, for example Effervescent 
MetamucilÂ® sold by The Procter & Gamble Company (Physicians 
Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs, 10th Edition, page 642; 
copyright 1989). These Metamucil products generate carbon dioxide upon 
mixing with water, which assists in the mixing process. The level of 
base in these products, however, is limited such that the pH of the 
psyllium drink mix suspension is low (about pH 4.5). The resulting 
product has a distinct tart/sour taste which is compatible with the 
flavors used (lemon-lime; orange). However it is not suitable for an 
unflavored version which is desired by certain consumers who wish to 
choose a wider variety of liquids besides just water for suspending the 
psyllium husk, for example milk and non-citrus fruit juices, and by 
consumers who simply prefer a non-flavored drink. CA-A-2 030 448 describes a psyllium drink mix composition comprising psyllium 
husk, edible acid and edible base. US 4,824,672 describes a pharmaceutical composition for use in reducing serum 
cholesterol levels, which contain gel-forming fibers and a mineral salt.  
 Through attempts to produce an unflavored drink mix version of 
smaller particle size psyllium husk, it was realized that while readily 
mixable and suspendable compositions can be prepared, the rate of 
gellation for such compositions are unacceptably rapid when the acidic 
flavoring agents were not included. Reducing this gellation rate is 
particularly desirable for consumer acceptability when smaller particle 
size psyllium husk is used in a drink mix composition, for example when 
preparing small particle size drink mix compositions as described in 
European Patent Application Publication No. 362,926, published April 
11, 1990 by The Procter & Gamble Company. Thus, there continues to be a need for unflavored psyllium-containing 
drink mix compositions which have slowed gellation rates  
 
relative to the gellation rate of psyllium alone in solution. The 
present
