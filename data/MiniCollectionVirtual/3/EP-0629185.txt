<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for preparing fatty acid esters of lower monohydric n-alcohols by transesterifying fatty acid glycerides in the presence of basic catalysts. The process is characterized in that after transesterification the ester phase is washed with glycerine, raw glycerine from glycerine preparation or the glycerine phase from a previous transesterification step, is completely separated from the last glycerine phase and is treated with bleaching earth, silicic acid or other physico-chemically similar substances. Without aqueous washing processes and without using aqueous acids for neutralizing the catalyst in the ester phases, this process, unlike known processes, allows products to be obtained from non-refined native oils having a quality which otherwise is only attainable by using purified oils and aqueous process steps.
