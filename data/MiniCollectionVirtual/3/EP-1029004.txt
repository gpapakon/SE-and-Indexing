<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing an additive-thickened water-based coating formulation exhibiting improved pourability, hiding characteristics, and thickening in relation to the quantities of rheological additive in the coating formulation. The process involves preparing an aqueous smectite clay slurry having 3 to 30 % clay by weight; bead milling the aqueous smectite slurry with a grinding media at an energy input in the range of from about 44 of 146 kw-hr/metric ton of dry clay; and incorporating the milled smectite slurry as a rheological additive in a water-based coating formulation in an amount in the range of from about 6 to 120 g per liter of formulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR PRODUCING RHEOLOGICAL ADDITIVES AND COATING COMPOSITIONS INCORPORATING SAMEField of InventionThe invention relates generally to a process for producing rheological additives, e.g. aqueous clay slurries, and to water-based coating compositions containing such additives. Background of InventionProcesses for wet milling clays so as to result in aqueous clay slurries are well known in the prior art. Such prior art is exemplified by U.S. patents 3,097,081; 3,754,712; 4, 118,245; 4, 118,246: and U.K. patent 1,120,219.The resultant aqueous clay slurries have been found to be useful as rheological additives for water-based coating formulations, e.g. latex paints. These water-based coating formulations generally require the addition of other thickeners such as hydroxyethyl cellulose ("HEC") alone or in combination with an alkali-swellable thickener such as "HASE".The coating industry has been seeking rheological additives such as aqueous clay slurries which would allow the preparation of water-based coating formulations which perform satisfactorily with reduced levels of such other thickeners. In particular, there is a need, from a cost and performance point of view, for satisfactory water-based coatings containing little or no HEC.The aqueous clay slurries prepared in accordance with the process of the invention meet the needs of the coating industry. In particular, the aqueous clay slurries prepared in accordance with the invention offer the following unique performance parameters: 

1. The instant aqueous clay slurries possess a rheology curve having lesser of a slope than that associated with prior art aqueous clay slurries. This difference in slope is demonstrated by the fact that latex paints containing the instant aqueous clay slurries exhibit a lower Brookfield viscosity value (measured at 20 °C and 1 rpm) than aqueous clay slurries prepared in accordance with prior art processes. Such lower Brookfield viscosity values translate into paints possessing less of a gelled consistency.2. Aqueous clay slurries prepared by the process of the invention have lower thixotropic indices and also exhibit delayed recovery of viscosity in comparison to aqueous clay slurries prepared by prior art processes. These properties translate into easier handling, i.e. easier to pump and pour, at higher solids levels.3. Aqueous clay slurries prepared by the process of the invention are considerably more cost effective than those prepared by the expensive prior art milling processes.4. Aqueous clay slurries prepared
