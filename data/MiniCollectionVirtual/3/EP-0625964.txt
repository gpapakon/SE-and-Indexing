Process for preparing an amorphous ultrahard 
material based on boron nitride and having a hardness 

sufficient to scratch diamond, starting from hexagonal or 
turbostratic boron nitride, which is compressed at 

pressures of at least 70 kbar or above and heated to 
temperatures of at least 1650°C or above, until a boron 

nitride melt is obtained, and the boron nitride melt 
formed is quenched by shutting off the heat supply, and 

the quenched boron nitride melt is then relieved of the 
pressure, 
characterised in that
 the hexagonal or 
turbostratic boron nitride as the starting material is 

treated in the presence of crystallisation inhibitors , 
which release ions or molecules which react with the boron 

nitride used as the starting material at pressures of at 
least 70 kbar and at temperatures of at least 1650°C, and 

whose reaction products are incorporated into the crystal 
lattice layers of the boron nitride. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 the crystallisation inhibitors used are chemical 
substances which give off oxygen (oxygen donors). 
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterised in 
that
 the oxygen donors only become active on reaching a 
temperature of at least 1200°C and release the oxygen 

which penetrates into the boron nitride crystal lattice 
layers and crosslinks these with the formation of a boron 

suboxide. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3 , 

characterised in that
 the pressure on the boron nitride 
used as the starting material and the crystallisation 

inhibitors is increased with rising temperature. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4 , 

characterised in that
 the pressure and temperature acting 
on the boron nitride used as the starting material and on  

 
the crystallisation inhibitors are sufficiently high to 

effect partial mutual crosslinking of the boron and 
nitrogen atoms of the boron nitride crystal lattice 

layers. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
, based on 100% by weight of hBN, 
from at least 0.001 to approximately 10% by weight of 

crystallisation inhibitors, especially chemical substances 
giving off oxygen, are used. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the oxygen donors used are peroxides. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6 , 

characterised in that
 the oxygen donors used are compounds 
containing alkali metals and/or alkaline earth 

metals. 
Process according to Claim 8, 
characterised in 
that
 the crystallisation inhibitors used are potassium 
permanganate, lithium carbonate and/or magnesium oxide. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9 , 

characterised in that
 the boron nitride used as the 
starting material and the crystallisation inhibitors are 

treated in the presence of a catalyst. 
Process according to Claim 10 , 
characterised in 
that
 catalytic solvents based on alkali metals and 
alkaline earth metals and the nitrides thereof, such as 

lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), lithium 
nitride (Li
3
N), magnesium nitride (Mg
3
N
2
) and calcium 
nitride (Ca
3
N
2
), are used. 
Process according to Claim 10 or 11, 
characterised 
in that
, based on 100% by weight of boron nitride 
as the starting material, from approximately 1 to 50% by 

weight of catalyst are used. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 12 , 

characterised in that
 the boron nitride used as the 
starting material and the crystallisation inhibitor as 

well as the solvent catalyst are compression-moulded, 
either on their own and/or in mixtures, into identical  

 
and/or different mouldings, and one or more mouldings of 

identical and/or different composition are loaded into a 
reaction chamber, in which they are subjected to the 

process parameters of pressure and temperature. 
Process according to claim 13 , 
characterised in 
that
 the starting materials are treated in a reaction 
chamber bounded by pyrophyllite. 
Amorphous ultrahard material based on boron 
nitride and having a hardness sufficient to scratch 

diamond, 
characterised by
 reaction products of boron 
nitride with crystallisation inhibitors, which reaction 

products are incorporated into the crystal lattice 
structure of the boron nitride to form a structure which 

is amorphous with respect to electron beams and X-rays. 
Amorphous ultrahard material according to Claim 
15, 
characterised in that
 boron suboxides are incorporated 
as the reaction products. 
Amorphous ultrahard material according to Claim 
15 or 16, 
characterised in that
 the structure, amorphous 
with respect to electron beams and X-rays, of the boron 

nitride containing the incorporated reaction products is 
crosslinked.
