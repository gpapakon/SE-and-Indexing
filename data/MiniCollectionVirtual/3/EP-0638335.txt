<ABSTRACT>
A deflagration suppression agent consisting of 
a dry powdery material composed of nonflammable particles 

each providing a surface area capable of rapidly absorbing 
heat and thereby cooling a deflagration reaction zone, 

and wherein at least 90% of the particles have a mean 
diameter of less than 20 microns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a suppression 
agent, and more particularly, to a powdery suppression agent 
for effectively extinguishing a flame front of a developing 
deflagration. Nonflammable powdery materials are used commonly 
as fire extinguishing agents. Generally, such agents are 
used to fill portable fire extinguishers that can be 
manually transported from a storage position to a region 
in which a fire has ignited. Most commercially available 
fire extinguishing powders consist primarily of relatively 
large particles having mean diameters of, for example, 
greater than 100 microns. Although the fire extinguishing 
efficiency of very small particles (VSPs) is known, high 
concentrations of VSP materials have not been employed as 
dry chemical fire extinguishing products because of inherent 
properties which are detrimental in typical fire 
extinguishing applications. Among these detrimental 
properties are high cost; low bulk density requiring larger, 
heavier and more costly containers and reduced "throw" which 
limits the effective range of a discharged powder stream. 
In addition, VSPs have the inherent characteristic of 
exhibiting a high degree of airborne persistence which is 
undesirable for fire extinguishing applications in which a 
desired objective is to coat flammable surfaces. Such 
coating of surfaces both extinguishes fire thereon and 
prevents the spread of flame. Because typical fires exist 
on surfaces, airborne suppression materials have little 
extinguishing effectiveness.  The object of this invention is to provide an 
improved dry powdery agent that will rapidly and effectively 
suppress developing deflagrations. The invention is a deflagration suppression agent 
consisting of a dry powdery material composed of nonflammable 
particles each providing a surface area capable of rapidly 
absorbing heat and thereby cooling a deflagration reaction 
zone, and wherein at least 90% of the particles have a 
mean diameter of less than 20 microns. Effective suppression 
of a deflagration is provided by the very small particles 
which enhance the extinguishing function per unit mass of 
material. According to specific features of the invention, 
the material is either silica, aluminum oxide, titanium 
oxide or combinations thereof. These materials exhibit 
ideal characteristics for the suppression function. According to another feature of the invention, 
90% of the particles have a mean diameter less than 5 microns. 
Suppression effectiveness is enhanced further by a 
reduction
