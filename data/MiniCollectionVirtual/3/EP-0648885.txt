<CLAIMS>
Device for cleaning the filter (2) of a drying
circuit employing a stream of hot air in a domestic

electrical appliance comprising a chamber (3) in which
the items to be dried are placed, characterized in that

it comprises fixed cleaning means (10, 12, 13) which
send during at least part of at least one phase of

operation of the machine a jet of water onto the filter
in the opposite direction to that of the stream of air

passing through this filter.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the phase of operation is a normal phase of

operation of the machine.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the phase of operation is a special cleaning

phase.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the cleaning means

comprise a plurality of nozzles (13) distributed so as
to face the back of the filter, these nozzles being

connected to a pipe (14) supplying water at pressure.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, for a machine in which, during at least one

phase of its operation, water is thrown in the general
direction of the filter, characterized in that the

cleaning means comprise deflecting surfaces (12) which
channel water thrown in this way towards the back of

the filter. 
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is fitted to a clothes

washing-drying machine or to a tumble drier.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that it is fitted to a clothes washer-drier, and in

that during the spinning phase the deflecting surfaces
channel some of the water ejected by the rotary drum

containing the wet washing towards the back of the
filter.
