<ABSTRACT>
A particulate foam control agent comprises 1 to 30 parts 
silicone antifoam, 70 to 99 parts zeolite carrier, 1 to 60% of 

the antifoam of an organopolysiloxane polyoxyalkylene 
copolymer, deposited onto the zeolite carrier not later than 

the antifoam and 1 to 40 parts by weight of a polycarboxylate-type 
binder or enca
psulant. This combination give good 
release in early stages, storage stability and powder 

characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to foam control agents which
are particulate, and especially those which are intended
for incorporation in detergent compositions which are in
powder form. The invention is particularly concerned
with silicone based foam control agents in powder form.Foam control agents based on silicone antifoams,
and foam control agents which are in particulate form,
are well known in the art. Many patent specifications
describe such foam control agents. Silicone base foam
control agents for powder detergent compositions are also
well known. Particulate foam control agents often use a
carrier material in combination with the foam control
agents to make these foam control agent into a more
substantial and more easily handled solid particulate
material, which can be post-blended as a powder with the
rest of the powder detergent composition.Materials which are suggested as carrier materials
for particulate silicone based foam control agents
include water soluble, water insoluble and water dispersible
materials. Examples of suggested carrier materials
are sulphates, carbonates, phosphates, polyphosphates,
silicas, silicates, clays, starches, cellulosic materials
and aluminosilicates. The use of carrier materials adds
a component to the final composition of the detergent
powder. If the carrier material is not itself a
component which contributes to the efficiency or activity
of the powder detergent, it will in effect constitute an
additional soil which has to be removed during the
laundering process. As a result it is desirable to use
materials which are standard components in detergent
powders. A particularly preferred carrier material for
particulate foam control agents is sodium tripolyphosphate.
However, in view of the desire to reduce, and
even eliminate, phosphates in detergent compositions for
environmental reasons there has been a need to find more
suitable carrier materials. Many materials do not have
the correct caking ability, density, particle strength or
size. This explains why many proposals have used non-active
materials in powder detergents, e.g. starch.
There is therefore a need to provide other suitable
materials as carriers for foam control agents. One
particularly useful active material for the detergent
composition is zeolite.Zeolites have been mentioned as an optional carrier
material for silicone foam control agents in a number of
patent specifications. For example, in G.B. 2 009 223
there is disclosed a process for the preparation of a
pulverulent detergent which comprises a
