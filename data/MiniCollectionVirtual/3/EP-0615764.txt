<ABSTRACT>
The method and system for controlling airway 
pressure in a ventilator during the inspiratory cycle by 

controlling the flow of breathing gas through a flow 
supply valve at a desired rate of supply flow and 

venting the breathing gas at a desired rate of outflow 
through a relief valve to achieve the desired airway 

pressure. Measurements of the rates of actual supply 
flow, the actual outflow through the exhalation/relief 

valve, and the pressure in the airway are compared with 
desired values for determination the amount of error for 

feedback control of the ventilator system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to breathing
ventilators, and more particularly relates to a system
and method for controlling patient airway pressure
during the inspiratory cycle of a breath by control of a
flow delivery valve and a relief valve in combination to
achieve a desired pressure level.Medical ventilators are designed to assist a
patient in breathing when the patient is somehow unable
to adequately breathe on his own. In some form of
ventilator systems, the patient is provided with
ventilation support in the form of pressure assistance
after the patient has began his inspiratory effort.
With such a system, it is desirable to immediately
increase the pressure after a breath is initiated in
order to reach a target pressure input by the care
provider. This rise in pressure causes flow to be
initiated in the patient airway which supplies breathing
gas to the patient's lungs. Conventional pressure
controlled ventilator systems control the flow of gas to
the patient by use of a pressure controller, a flow
controller and flow valve in the inlet side of the
airway, terminating the flow when the target pressure is
reached.However, such a control strategy often results
in over pressurization of the patient, with the pressure 
overshooting the target pressure by a greater or lesser
amount depending on the physiology of the patient and
the construction of the airway. Often, the overshoot is
sustained, thus over pressurizing the patient's lungs
for the entire inspiration cycle of the breath. When
this occurs, the possibility exists that the patient
will be harmed by the higher than desirable pressure in
the lungs. For instance, if the patient has recently
had thoracic or abdominal surgery, the possibility
exists that such over pressures could rupture sutures or
blood vessels recently repaired in the surgery.
Similarly, a very frail or infirm patient such as one
with asthma or emphysema could be harmed if the breath
pressure is in excess of that desired.For these reasons, it would be desirable if
the delivery of breaths in a pressure controlled
ventilator could be controlled to eliminate overshoot or
long term over pressurization in the patient airway. It
would be particularly advantageous if the control of
such overshoots could be accomplished without
significant changes to the basic configuration and
utilized existing components.One suggested solution to the problem of over
pressuristation is described in US-A-4,527,557 to
include the provision of an exhalation valve.
However, as described, the

A method of controlling airway pressure in a

patient during the inspiratory cycle of a breath, the
breathing gas circuit (6) having a source of breathing

gas, an airway flow path in fluid communication with a
breathing attachment of the patient for supplying the

breathing gas to the breathing attachment, a flow
supply valve (14) for controlling the supply of

breathing gas to the breathing attachment, and a
relief valve (18) for controlling venting of breathing

gas from the patient to the atmosphere, the method
comprising the step of delivering a supply flow of

breathing gas to the breathing attachment through the
flow supply valve (14) at a predetermined rate of

supply flow based upon a desired airway pressure and
actual airway pressure, characterised in that the

method further comprises the steps of determining a

outflow through the relief valve (18), comparing the
actual rate of outflow with the desired rate of

outflow to determine an outflow error, generating a
