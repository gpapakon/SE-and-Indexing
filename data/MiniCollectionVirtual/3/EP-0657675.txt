<ABSTRACT>
A reusable clamp structure in which the clamping 
band (11) is provided with a tongue-like extension (30) at one 

end and with a fork-like end portion (20) at the other end which 
includes a slot-like opening (21); a form-locking connection of 

the open ends of the clamping band is achieved by sawtooth-like 
members (33, 33') extending outwardly along the lateral edges of 

the tongue-like extension which are adapted to engage with 
complementary sawtooth-like members (20', 20'a) extending 

inwardly from the longitudinal edges of the opening. To prevent 
outward escape of the tongue-like extension (30) in its engaged 

condition, a cover member (40, 140) may be provided over the 
opening (21) whereby the cover member may be punched out of the 

clamping band and bent out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamp structure with
a toothed locking arrangement, and more particularly to a clamp
structure with a sawtooth-like locking arrangement which is
devoid of any steps, offsets or discontinuities along the
internal clamping surfaces to assure a completely satisfactory
fluid-tight seal over 360° of the object to be fastened thereby.Toothed locking arrangements have been used heretofore
in connection with various devices for tightening objects. For
example, plastic tightening devices used to fasten together
cables and cable strands are commercially available which are
provided at one band end with vertical teeth projecting
outwardly, i.e., perpendicularly with respect to the plane of the
band and, at the other end, with a lug having a detent element
within the lug adapted to engage with the vertically disposed
teeth.Toothed locking arrangements are also known in
connection with hose clamps. For example, the U.S. Patent
2,374,541 discloses radially outwardly extending ratchet teeth
with which a spring tongue is adapted to engage. Another clamp
provided with outwardly extending teeth is disclosed in U.S.
Patent 3,925,851 in which a form-locking connection of the open
ends of the clamping band is attained by the external and
internal teeth of both band ends engaging in one another.
However, as the form-locking connection of this clamp can be 
released only by lateral deflection of the clamping band, this
type of clamp is made from plastic material because such material
allows more readily lateral deflection.In addition to vertically disposed toothed locking
arrangements, i.e., with teeth extending outwardly of and more or
less perpendicularly to the plane of the clamping band, toothed
locking arrangements are also known which are essentially within
the plane of the clamping band itself. The U.S. Patent 2,405,912
discloses internal ratchet teeth provided on both sides of a slot
that extends longitudinally in one band end while the other band
end is provided with a T-shaped stud that is adapted to engage
with the oppositely disposed ratchet teeth after passing through
an enlarged opening.Apart from complicated structures involving high
manufacturing costs, the prior art patents all entail the
disadvantage that they are unable to assure a clamp structure
with internal clamping surfaces devoid of steps, offsets or
discontinuities to assure a completely satisfactory, fluid-tight
clamping action over the entire 360° circumference of the object
to be fastened.My prior U.S. Patents
