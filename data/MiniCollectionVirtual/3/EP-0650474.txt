<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain novel piperidyl
amides, sulfonamides and sulfoxamides which are useful as
inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and as agents which
lower total serum cholesterol in patients in need thereof.
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical
compositions for the use of these novel compounds.The conversion of the acyclic polyolefin squalene to the
cyclic steroid lanosterol is a key step in the biogenesis of
cholesterol. This conversion occurs in two steps. Squalene
epoxidase catalyzes the conversion of squalene to (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene.
Oxidosqualene cyclase then converts (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene
to lanosterol. Lanosterol is converted
through a number of subsequent enzymatic steps to
cholesterol. Inhibition of squalene epoxidase decreases the
amount of oxidosqualene available for conversion to
cholesterol. Inhibition of oxidosqualene cyclase decreases
the amount of lanosterol available for conversion to
cholesterol. Inhibition of squalene epoxidase and/or
oxidosqualene cyclase thus results in a decrease in the
amount of cholesterol synthesized and ultimately causes a
lowering of cholesterol in the blood. Atherosclerosis, as manifested in its major clinical
complication, ischemic heart disease, continues to be a
major cause of death in industrialized countries. It is now
well accepted that atherosclerosis can begin with local
injury to the arterial endothelium followed by proliferation
of arterial smooth muscle cells from the medial layer to the
intimal layer along with deposition of lipid and
accumulation of foam cells in the lesion. As the
atherosclerotic plaque develops it progressively occludes
more and more of the affected blood vessel and can
eventually lead to ischemia or infarction. Therefore, it is
desirable to provide methods of inhibiting the progression
of atherosclerosis in patients in need thereof.There is now a large body of evidence demonstrating that
hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor associated
with heart disease. For example, in December 1984, a
National Institute of Health Consensus Development
Conference Panel concluded that lowering definitely elevated
blood cholesterol levels (specifically blood levels of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol) will reduce the risk of
heart attacks due to coronary heart disease. Accordingly,
it is desirable to provide a method for reducing blood
cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia.Typically, cholesterol is carried in the blood of warm-blooded
animals in certain lipid-protein complexes
