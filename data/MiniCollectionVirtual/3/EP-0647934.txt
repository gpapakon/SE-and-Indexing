<ABSTRACT>
An electronic musical apparatus having a performance 
information analyzer for automatically analyzing a performance 

information of a musical tune into a plurality of 
performance parts, wherein the analyzer is designed to be 

applied with a performance information including a plurality 
of tone pitch informations for detecting a performance 

style of the performance information and for analyzing the 
performance information into a plurality of performance 

parts in accordance with the detected performance style.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic musical
apparatus which includes a performance information analyzer
for analyzing a performance information including a plurality
of tone pitch informations of a musical tune into a
plurality of performance parts, and more particularly to an
electronic musical apparatus of the type which includes a
chord detection device associated with the performance
information analyzer for detecting a chord on a basis of
the analyzed performance parts.In recent years, there has been proposed an electronic
musical instrument for harmonizing automatic accompaniment
with performance played on a keyboard, as disclosed in JP 62-33594 and JP-62-33595. In this kind of
electronic musical instruments, chord performance of the
accompaniment tone is effected on a basis of a performance
information applied from the keyboard or key-codes of
depressed keys of the keyboard. In general, melody performance
is played at a higher tone area of the keyboard
where mainly key-codes of non-chord tones relative to the
chord are detected. For this reason, the keyboard is
imaginarily divided into a left-hand key area for the lower
tone and a right-hand key area for the higher tone so that 
a chord is detected on a basis of key-codes of depressed
keys at the left-hand area.In the case that a chord is detected on a basis of a
tone pitch information such as the key-codes, there is a
tone area suitable for detection of the chord. Accuracy of
the chord detection is, however, influenced by the tone
area. Since the tone area changes in accordance with
performance of a musical tune, there has been proposed an
electronic musical instrument capable of enhancing accuracy
in detection of the chord under control of a manual switch
arranged to be operated by a user for changing a boundary
between the left-hand key area and the right-hand key area.
In the electronic musical instrument, however, the manual
switch must be operated by the user during performance of
the musical tune, resulting in a difficulty in operation of
the manual switch. In addition, the performance itself is
restricted since the tone area for performance of each part
is limited.On the other hand, almost all musical tunes can be
divided into a plurality of performance parts such as a
melody part or a bass part which includes an appropriate
performance part for detection of the chord. It is, therefore,
able to enhance accuracy in detection of the chord in
accordance with the performance part if a performance
information can be analyzed into

<CLAIMS>
An electronic musical apparatus having input means receiving
performance information with tone pitch data and timing data

and a performance information analyzer analyzing the
performance information of a musical tune into a plurality of

respective performance parts such as a melody part, a melody
chord part, a bass part and a bass chord part,

characterized in that the performance information analyzer
comprises:


detection means detecting a performance style of the
performance information in the form of at least one of

arpeggio style performance, chord style performance and
normal style performance, normal being assigned to a style

which is neither arpeggio nor chord style performance, based
on at least said tone pitch data and said timing data; and
analyzing means separating the performance information into a
plurality of respective performance parts in accordance with

the detected performance style, said tone pitch data
and said timing data.
An electronic musical apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said detection means comprises:

means detecting a performance style of the performance
information on a basis of plural combinations of the number

of depressed keys on a keyboard operable to a player,
presence of a measure head at an instant timing, a strong

beat or weak beat tone at the instant timing and an interval
relative to previously generated performance information.
An electronic musical apparatus as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said detection means comprises:

style analysis means detecting a performance style of the
performance information by analyzing a beat in a measure of

the performance information, a difference in tone pitch data
between previously generated tone pitch data and instant tone

pitch data, a number of tone pitch data from a same timing
and a difference in tone pitch of the tone pitch data at the

same timing.
A method for analyzing input performance information of a
musical tune into a plurality of respective performance parts

such as a melody part, a melody chord part, a bass part and a
bass chord part,

characterized in that the method comprises the steps of:

detecting a performance style of the input performance
information in the form of at least one of arpeggio style

performance, chord style performance and normal style
performance, normal being assigned to a style which is

neither arpeggio nor chord style performance, based on tone
pitch data and timing data included in the performance

information; and 
separating the input performance information into a plurality
of respective performance parts in accordance with the

detected performance style, said tone pitch data and said
timing data.
A method for analyzing performance information as claimed in
claim 4, wherein said separating step includes allotting the

input performance information to a melody part, a melody
chord part, a bass part and a bass chord part of the musical

tune in accordance with the detected performance style, said
tone pitch data and said timing data.
