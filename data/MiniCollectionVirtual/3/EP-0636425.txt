<ABSTRACT>
A pressure washer is provided with a flow control 
switch and a bypass passage. The flow control 

switch (91,93,98) shuts the 
motor of the pressure washer off when fluid is not being 

supplied to the pressure washer or when the spray gun of the 
pressure washer is closed. The bypass passage (71b,71c,71d) 

relieves excess 
outlet pressure and activates the flow control switch when the 

spray gun is closed. The pressure washer may include a soap 
pump for injecting soap into low pressure fluid at the inlet of 

the pressure washer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pressure washers, and, more 
particularly, to a pressure washer which is equipped with a flow 
control switch for shutting off power to the pressure washer if 
fluid is not flowing through the pressure washer. Pressure washers are well known devices for delivering 
water or other washing fluid under high pressure, e.g., about 
1200 to 2000 psi. Pressure washers conventionally include a 
pump assembly which includes a plurality of pumping pistons 
which are driven by an electric motor or an internal combustion 
motor. Fluid is commonly supplied to the pump by a garden 
hose. Pressure washers of this type are described in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 5,068,975, 5,067,654, and 5,174,723. Conventional electric pressure washers utilize a main 
power switch which requires the operator of the pressure washer 
to physically move the switch from one position (off) to another 
position (on) to supply electrical power to the electric motor 
of the pressure washer. If the power cord is plugged into an 
electric outlet, the electric motor will start and will continue 
to run until the switch is physically moved to the off position. If the electric motor is started without water or other 
washing fluid being supplied to the pressure washer, the pump 
might overheat and fail without the cooling and lubrication 
which the water provides. Electrical and mechanical safety 
hazards could also result from that type of operation. If the flow of water is stopped after the pressure 
washer is turned on, for example, if a kink develops in the 
garden hose which supplies the water or if another person turns 
off the water faucet, similar difficulties could arise if the 
motor was not turned off and the pump continued to run. Many current pressure washers include a by-pass valve 
and a by-pass passage which activates when the high pressure gun  
 
is deactivated. Since the electric motor and pump continue to 
run, it is necessary to recirculate the water in a by-pass mode 
to cool the pump. Many units have a time limit of around five 
minutes during which the unit may be operated in the by-pass 
mode. If this time limit is exceeded, damage to the pump can 
result. The invention provides a flow control switch for a 
pressure washer which prevents the pressure washer from being 
turned on if water is not being supplied to the pressure washer 
and which automatically turns the pressure washer off if the 
flow of water through the pressure washer stops. The invention 
thereby prevents premature failure of the pressure

<CLAIMS>
A pressure washer comprising: 
   a fluid pump housing having an inlet and an outlet, 

   a pumping piston movably mounted in the housing for 
pumping fluid from the inlet to the outlet, 

   a motor for driving the pumping piston, 
   a nozzle connected to the outlet and including a valve 

for opening and closing the nozzle, 

   characterized by a flow switch on the pump housing for 
shutting off the motor when fluid is not flowing into the inlet, 

and 
   means for relieving excess outlet pressure when the 

nozzle valve is closed. 
The pressure washer of claim 1 further 
characterized by said pressure relieving means including a 

bypass passage in the pump housing extending from the outlet to 
the inlet, and valve means in the bypass passage for closing the 

bypass passage until the fluid pressure at the outlet exceeds a 
predetermined value. 
The pressure washer of claim 2 further 
characterized by said valve means in the bypass passage 

comprising a two-stage poppet valve having a first 
small-diameter stage which is engageable with a valve seat in 

the bypass passage and a second large-diameter stage whereby 
greater fluid pressure is required to move the poppet valve from 

a closed position to an open position than is required to 
maintain the poppet valve in an open position. 
The pressure washer of claim 3 further 
characterized by said poppet valve including a conical end which 

is engageable with the valve seat in the bypass passage. 
The pressure washer of claim 2 further 
characterized by the pump housing being provided with a 

switch-actuating passage which extends from the bypass passage 
 

to the flow switch whereby fluid flowing through the bypass 
passage flows into the switch-actuating passage and opens the 

flow switch, thereby shutting off the motor. 
The pressure washer of claim 5 further 
characterized by the bypass passage including a small diameter 

portion between the switch-actuating passage and the inlet which 
has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the switch-actuating 

passage. 
The pressure washer of claim 1 further 
characterized by the pump housing including a switch passage 

which communicates with the inlet, and the flow switch includes 
a first magnet movably mounted in the switch passage, a second 

magnet movably mounted on the pump housing outside of the switch 
passage, and an electrical switch mounted adjacent the second 

magnet and having a contact element which is engageable by the 
second magnet to close the electrical switch, whereby when fluid 

flows through the inlet the first magnet is moved toward the 
second magnet and the second magnet is magnetically repulsed to 

close the electrical switch and when fluid is not flowing 
through the inlet the electrical switch is open. 
The pressure washer of claim 7 further 
characterized by a spring in the switch passage which is 

engageable with the first magnet when the first magnet moves 
away from the second magnet. 
The pressure washer of claim 7 further 
characterized by the first magnet being mounted on a piston 

which is slidably positioned in the switch passage. 
The pressure washer of claim 7 further 
characterized by an inlet fitting which is secured to the pump 

housing and which is provided with an internal bore and a spring 
positioned in the internal bore and extending toward the first 

magnet, the first magnet being engageable with the spring when 
the first magnet moves away from the second magnet. 
The pressure washer of claim 7 further 
characterized by the pressure relieving means including a bypass 

passage in the pump housing extending from the outlet to the 
inlet, valve means in the bypass passage for closing the bypass 

passage until the fluid pressure at the outlet exceeds a 
predetermined value, and a switch-actuating passage which 

extends from the bypass passage to the switch passage whereby 
fluid flowing through the bypass passage flows into the 

switch-actuating passage and moves the first magnet away from 
the second magnet, thereby opening the electrical switch. 
The pressure washer of claim 11 further 
characterized by the bypass passage including a small diameter 

portion between the switch-actuating passage and the inlet which 
has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the switch-actuating 

passage. 
The pressure washer of claim 1 further 
characterized by the motor including means for reciprocating the 

piston, a soap pump mounted adjacent the reciprocating means and 
including a soap pump housing and a soap pump piston 

reciprocably mounted in the soap pump housing, the soap pump 
piston being engageable by the reciprocating means for 

reciprocating the soap pump piston, the soap pump housing having 
a soap inlet and a soap outlet, and means for delivering soap 

from the soap outlet to the inlet of the fluid pump housing. 
The pressure washer of claim 13 further 
characterized by check valve means at the soap inlet and the 

soap outlet for opening and closing the soap inlet and soap 
outlet as the soap piston reciprocates. 
The pressure washer of claim 13 further 
characterized by the soap pump housing being provided with a 

bleed opening. 
The pressure washer of claim 15 further 
characterized by the bleed opening is smaller than the soap 

inlet and the soap outlet.
