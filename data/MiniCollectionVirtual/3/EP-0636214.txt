Telescoping tubular assembly comprising: 

at least one relatively larger diameter first 
tubular section (1) and one relatively smaller diameter 

second tubular section (2), the second tubular section 
(2) having an inside end (4) accommodated inside the 

first tubular section (1) and being free to rotate and to 
slide in the first tubular section (1) between a 

retracted position and a deployed position, 
an axial end-piece (7) including a generally 
conical bearing surface (8) in alignment with the inside 

end (4) of the second tubular section (2) inside the 
first tubular section (1), 
an expandable locking ring (10) with a central 
part (12) through which passes a substantially 

cylindrical axial hole (11) between a first generally 
conical inside bearing surface (15) adapted to bear 

against the generally conical bearing surface (8) of the 
axial end-piece (7) and a conical internal second bearing 

surface (16) at the opposite end, the ring including two 
series of longitudinal slits (19, 20, 21) allowing it to 

deform radially, 
axial clamping means (17) comprising a head 
having a generally conical annular surface (18) adapted 

to bear against the second internal conical bearing 
surface (16) of the ring, the axial clamping means (17) 

being adapted to push the ring (10) selectively against 
the generally conical bearing surface (8) of the axial 

end-piece (7), so deforming the ring radially outwards to 
press it against the inside wall of the first tubular 

section (1), 
connecting means for fastening the clamping means 
(17) and the second tubular section (2) together axially,
 
characterized in that: 
the ring (10) includes two end parts (13, 14) with  
 

axial hole, in which the axial hole is of greater diameter 
and is joined to the hole in the central part (12) by the 

first internal conical bearing surface (15) of the ring and 
the second internal conical bearing surface (16) of the 

ring, respectively, 
the slits occupy substantially half the length of 
the ring (10), 
the internal conical bearing surfaces (15, 16) 
are arranged substantially at one third and two thirds of the 

length of the ring (10). 
Telescoping tubular assembly according to 
claim 1 characterized in that: 


the slits (19) of the first series of slits are 
interleaved with the slits (20, 21) of the second series 

of slits. 
Telescoping tubular assembly according to 
claim 1 or claim 2 characterized in that the head of the 

clamping means (17) has a polygonal cross-section and is 
inserted in an axial housing (28) of the ring (10) having 

a corresponding polygonal cross-section preventing 
rotation of the clamping means (17) relative to the 

ring (10). 
Telescoping tubular assembly according to any 
one of claims 1 to 3 characterized in that the clamping 

means (17) is a screw whose head forms the head of 
the clamping means (17) and whose screwthreaded shank is 

screwed into an axial screwthreaded hole of the axial 
end-piece (7). 
Telescoping tubular assembly according to any 
one of claims 1 to 3 characterized in that the clamping 

means (17) is a nut forming the head of the 
clamping means (17) and screwing onto a screwthreaded 

protruding axial part (9) of the axial end-piece (7) 
passing through the ring (10). 
Telescoping tubular assembly according to any  
 

one of claims 1 to 5 characterized in that longitudinal 
ribs are provided on the inside surface of the first 

tubular section (1), said longitudinal ribs engaging in 
corresponding longitudinal grooves on the ring (10) to 

prevent the ring (10) from rotating relative to the first 
tubular section (1). 
Telescoping tubular assembly according to any 
one of claims 1 to 6 characterized in that a seal is 

provided between the first tubular section (1) and the 
second tubular section (2) by a sealing ring (22) fitted 

around the overlapping end (27) of the larger diameter 
first tubular section (1) relative to which it is 

prevented from moving in translation, the sealing ring 
(22) including a curved end (26) which caps the edge of 

the first tubular section (1) and bears against the 
peripheral surface of the second tubular section (2). 
Telescoping tubular assembly according to any 
one of claims 1 to 6 characterized in that a seal is 

provided between the first tubular section (1) and the 
second tubular section (2) by a sealing ring (22) fitted 

around the end of the larger diameter first tubular 
section (1) relative to which it is prevented from 

rotating and from moving in translation, the sealing ring 
(22) including a curved end (26) adapted to cap an 

annular spacer (25) inserted between the curved end (26) 
of said ring (22) and the edge of the larger diameter 

first tubular section (1), the spacer being able to slide 
on the smaller diameter second tubular section (2).
