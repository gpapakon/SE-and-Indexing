<ABSTRACT>
A pressure switch particularly adapted for use with 
high pressure fluid is shown having a frusto-conical 

support surface in the form of a protuberance (121) 
formed at the center of a surface of a piston guide member 

(12). A stretchable diaphragm cap member (14) 
generally in the shape of an inverted V is closely fitted 

on the protuberance of the piston guide member 
as well as the head (111b) of a piston member 

(111) received in and projecting out of bore (120) 
formed centrally through protuberance. 

The outer thickened peripheral berm of the cap 
member is inserted into a recess (102e) in 

the wall defining an enlarged portion of the bore (102) 
which in turn opens to a cavity (103) of the upper 

housing (10) in which piston guide member is 
disposed. The cap member serves to seal the fluid 

passage side of the switch from the remainder of the 
switch. In several embodiments a ring is 

placed between the cap member and the conical 
support surface to reduce sliding friction and 

to prevent extrusion of the cap member material into a gap 
formed between the piston member and the piston 

guide bore.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to pressure switches and 
more particularly to pressure switches particularly adapted for 
use with high pressure fluid for actuating a switch mechanism in 
response to changes in fluid pressure being monitored. There has been in recent years marked technical progress in 
the field of pneumatic and hydraulic systems which has led to the 
need for the development of a small sized, durable and high 
reliability pressure switch capable of withstanding high fluid 
pressure. In the field of braking systems and power steering 
systems for the automotive industry in recent years, for example, 
there has been a demand for the development of a pressure switch 
adapted for use with high pressure fluid, small in size, light in 
weight, with improved safety and highly reliable for an extended 
period of time for the purpose of achieving improved fuel 
efficiency. Typical examples of pressure switches made according to the 
prior art include one in which a thin film type of flexible 
diaphragm is displaced in response to fluid pressure with the 
contact of a switching mechanism being actuated by the 
displacement of this diaphragm. Pressure switches of this kind are known, for instance, from documents EP-A-0 517 674, US-A-4 091 249 and FR-A-2 663 781. Another example is one in which 
the peripheral edge of a diaphragm, in the form of a metallic 
disc, is fixed to a housing by such means as welding, the center 
of the diaphragm being moved between convex and concave 
configurations by the pressure differential between the two sides  
 
of the disc, with the contact of the switching mechanism being 
actuated in response to the disc movement. The pressure switch of the latter type is such that the 
diaphragm serves both as a fluid seal and as a component part 
that carries out the actuating movement. Different pressure switches are also known, in which a piston or force transmitting member is slidably received in a bore and so as to remove under the action of the acting pressure, diaphragms and other sealing members being also provided to prevent fluid for coming into contact with the switch system. Switches of this type are known, for example, from documents US 4,495,389 and US-A-3,302,269. However, a problem is associated with the former pressure 
switch described above in that a high stress is generated locally 
in the diaphragm, thereby markedly reducing the life of the 
diaphragm. With respect to the latter type described above, 
welding of the peripheral portion of the diaphragm
