<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital recording and reproducing, and
is concerned particularly, although not exclusively, with digital signal
magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus which can record and
reproduce digital signals at high-density on a bandwidth-restricted channel in
a digital video tape recorder or the like.As analog signals and circuits are being progressively replaced by
digital signals and circuits, due to the continuing development of the related
technology, various kinds of digital recording and reproducing methods have
been provided.Although a digital signal magnetic recording and reproducing
apparatus, which records and reproduces a digital image signal, is excellent
in picture quality and dubbing performance in comparison with an analog
magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus, which records and reproduces
an analog image signal, the quantity of data to be recorded on a tape may be
over ten times as large as that of an analog magnetic recording and
reproducing apparatus, in recording the same image signal. In other words,
by analog-to-digital conversion, the quantity of the signal data in a digital
magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus is increased considerably.
Accordingly, when a digital signal is recorded, the tape consumption is
increased and it is difficult to record a great number of signals. Therefore,
for the purpose of obtaining the same efficiency as that of an analog signal
recording, it is necessary to increase recording efficiency by compressing
data, modulating binary data to data of multiple-value level, recording the 
modulated data and improving bit error rate (BER) by increasing signal-to-noise
ratio.Because of the difficulty of recording and reproducing direct current
components using a recording and modulating method applicable to a
conventional digital magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus, base band
modulating methods such as a non return to zero inverse modulation (NRZI),
partial response(PR) modulation, eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM), etc.
have been employed Such base band modulating methods convert the
zero-run length of data rows to be expressed in a binary code and record the
concentrated signal frequency to attain a high-density recording. However,
the base band modulation method, in which the signal level to be recorded has
only two potential values, makes high-density recording difficult because of
a low coefficient of utilization of recording frequency bands. Because of
increased tape consumption, long-duration
