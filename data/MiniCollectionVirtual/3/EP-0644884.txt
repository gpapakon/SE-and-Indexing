 DESCRIPTIONNovel Tetrahydrocannabinol Derivatives andProtein and Polvpeptide TetrahydrocannabinolDerivative Conjugates and LabelsField of the InventionThis invention is in the field of ligand receptor assays, including i munoassays, for the detection of selected metabolites of tetrahydrocannabinol in a fluid sample. More particularly, this invention relates to methods for the synthesis of novel tetrahydrocannabinol derivatives and protein and polypeptide tetrahydrocannabi¬ nol derivative conjugates and labels for use in the prepa¬ ration of antibodies to tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites and for use in the immunoassay process.Background of the Invention l-Δ°-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most psycho- active constituent of the marihuana plant (Cannabis sativa) . The use of marihuana can result in euphoria, hallucinations, sedation and temporal distortion. Its widespread abuse has prompted a need to monitor the use. THC is metabolized to a variety of psychoactive and inac¬ tive derivatives and the majority of the metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronides (Life Sci. 37, 1637 (1975), Res. Comm. Chem. Path. Pharm. 17, 421 (1977) and Clin. Pharm. Ther. 2 , 352 (1983)).The preparation of antibodies to THC metabolites requires the synthesis of a THC derivative in order to covalently attach the derivative to an antigenic poly- peptide or. protein. In addition, the THC derivative is covalently attached to various polypeptides, proteins or labels for use in screening antibodies and in the immuno¬ assay process. The THC derivative should mimic the struc¬ ture of the THC metabolite sought to be measured. There- fore, the selection and synthesis of the types of THC 

derivatives for covalent attachment to proteins, polypep¬ tides or labels is critical. In addition, the THC deri¬ vatives need to be stable and soluble in an aqueous solution. THC compounds and conjugates for immunization and immunoassay have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,833,073 and Euro. Pat. Appl. No. 279,308.Summary of the InventionThe present invention is directed to novel THC deriva- tives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation of antibodies to the THC metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for the production of antibodies using standard methods. Once generated, the antibodies and the novel derivatives which are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels may be used in the immunoassay process.DefinitionsIn accordance with the
