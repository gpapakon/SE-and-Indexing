<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a oil well pipe for casing,
which is not destroyed by ground subsidence.An oil well for extracting crude oil is formed by a tubing,
which is an oil well pipe for drawing up crude oil from the oil
reservoir to the ground, and a casing, which is an oil well pipe for
protecting the tubing. Since most oil wells are bored
substantially in the vertical direction, a downward pulling
frictional force acts on the oil well pipe for casing (hereinafter
called oil well pipe) due to ground subsidence caused by the
extraction of crude oil etc.In the conventional oil well, however, the aforementioned
frictional force acting on the oil well pipe is not always high, so
that the possibility that the oil well pipe is destroyed by the
frictional force is not always high. Therefore, the measures for
reducing the frictional force have not been taken.US-A-4 483 396 discloses a landfill gas well which compensates
for ground shift by providing a tubular gas extracting means
comprising a pipe and an upper pipe, which is sufficiently
smaller than the pipe, in order to enable the pipe and a
closely fitting pipe sleeve to be freely received within the
bore of the pipe. That is, D1 relates only to mechanical
devices being not deformable and not showing a viscous 
behavior such as sleeves and O-rings. GB-A-2 107 422 discloses
the treatment of pipes to increase the ductile fracture
resistance in the axial direction by wrapping a plurality of
continuos unidirectional high-strength fibers around a pipe in
the form of a wrapping. US-A-4 036 539 relates to a drill pipe
string wherein the non-bearing parts of the string and the
stabilizer are coated with an adherent plastic coating which
is characterized by a low coefficient of friction, abrasive
resistance, low surface tension, durability, toughness and
slickness, in order to prevent the sticking or balling of the
drill string within the bore or casing due to build-up of
drill cuttings and the like about the stabilizer blades. "Oil
and Gas Journal", vol. 76 (1978), no. 36, pp. 107-111,
describes a method that permits the bending of polyurethane-coated
pipes by coating a pipe with a polyurethane foam and
applying a melt extruded polyethylene sheet on the coated
pipe. US-A-4 796 670 relates to a drill pipe protector for
reducing the frictional forces between the drill string and
the casing, wherein the protector includes at least an outer
portion and surface made of an elastomeric material, by
polishing the interior surface of the casing and allowing a
thin
