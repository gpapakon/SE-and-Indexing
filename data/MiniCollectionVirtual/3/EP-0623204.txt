<ABSTRACT>
In a welded plate heat exchanger the edge portion of each heat transferring plate (2) is welded together with the edge portions of a first adjacent heat transferring plate (3) along an outer line (10B) and with the edge portion of a second adjacent heat transferring plate (1) along an inner line (11B). In order to facilitate, in connection with welding together of the heat transferring plates from only one direction, that the contact is maintained between the plates along said outer line (10B) each heat transferring plate is formed with a stiffening crease (18) outside said outer line. The stiffening crease (18) extends along the edge of the plate outside said outer line (10B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plate heat exchanger 
comprising a stack of thin heat transferring plates each 
of which has a central heat transferring portion provided 
with a pressed pattern of spacing protuberances and 
depressions and an edge portion extending along the edge 
of the heat transferring plate and surrounding said heat 
transferring portion, a first heat transferring plate, 
that is situated between two other heat transferring 
plates in the stack, being welded by its edge portion 
together with the edge portion of one of said two other 
heat transferring plates along an outer line and being 
welded together with the edge portion of the other one 
of said two other heat transferring plates along an 
inner line which is situated inside said outer line, and 
the edge portions of the heat transferring plates 
extending into contact with each other along said inner 
and outer lines. A plate heat exchanger of this kind, known for instance 
by GB 580 368, may be manufactured by first welding 
together heat transferring plates in pairs along the 
respective said inner lines and, thereafter, welding 
together already united plate pairs along the respective 
said outer lines. A plate heat exchanger constructed in 
a different but alternative way is known by GB-A-2 126 
703. Conventional welding technique normally requires in 
connection with welding together of two plates that welding 
tools are put into contact with both of the plates. 
Modern welding technique, however, such as laser welding 
and electronic beam welding, makes it possible to weld 
together two superimposed plates by use of a welding 
tool only on one side of the two plates. An advantage of  
 
modern welding technique also is that less heat has to 
be generated in the plates to be welded together. By means of modern welding technique it would thus be 
possible in connection with welding together of several 
heat transferring plates to stack the plates successively 
onto each other and successively weld them together 
by applying a welding tool only from one direction. 
Preferably, the first plate is placed on a horizontal 
support, whereafter the other plates one after one are 
superimposed and welded onto the underlying plate. Possibly, modern welding technique will make it possible 
in the future also to weld together simultaneously 
several plates stacked on each other by use of welding 
tools only on one side of the plate stack. However, in connection with attempts to manufacture 
welded plate heat exchangers of the
