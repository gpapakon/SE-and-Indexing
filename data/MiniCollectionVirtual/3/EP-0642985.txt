<ABSTRACT>
A containerisation system which comprises at least 
one inner water soluble or water dispersible bag (110) 

containing a hazardous agrochemical composition in solid 
form, the containerisation system further comprising an 

outer water soluble or water dispersible bag (120) 
containing another hazardous agrochemical composition in 

solid form different from the first, the outer bag also 
containing the inner bag with its content.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a containerization system which
is particularly suitable for storing, packaging and transporting toxic or hazardous
agricultural chemical compositions, such as pesticides and
concentrates thereof.At present, most hazardous and toxic liquids are stored in metal drums or,
where smaller quantities are involved, in plastic containers. Hazardous compounds,
especially agrochemical compounds, are formulated in various compositions.The expression toxic or hazardous compounds as used herein means an
industrial chemical or agrochemical compound, which, if released in the quantity
or concentration normally in storage and shipping containers, may cause damage to
the environment or be injurious to a person contacted by it.With respect to agricultural chemicals, liquid compositions, particularly in
the form of concentrates, are most convenient for farmers because of the relative
ease with which they can be handled. There are, nevertheless, difficulties in
handling such liquid compositions. There is a danger of spillage or leakage if holes
develop in containers that are accidentally dropped and thereby crack or fail.
Containers have been developed which possess great resistance to impact and
shock. While such containers are secure under normal storage and handling
conditions, in the event of an accident, for example during transporting, there
remains an appreciable risk of spillage or leakage with rapid loss of liquid. Usage
of toxic and hazardous chemicals can create damage to the environment.The chemical and packaging industries have long sought a secure
container which provides sufficient safeguard for those handling it, such as farmers
and transporters, as well as adequate protection for the environment. It is known, for example
from GB-A-922,317,
to package agrochemicals in solid form in soluble bags or
sachets made from water soluble films.However there are some cases whereby the use of water soluble (or water
dispersible, as always contemplated herein) bags is either impossible or of highly
limited interest.This is or can be the situation when two or more agrochemicals are used
together to treat a crop or any kind of plant(s) and when only one of hem is used in
the form of a water soluble bag.It is also or can be also the situation when two or more agrochemicals are
used together to treat a crop or any kind of plant(s) and when the normal use of
these agrochemicals is at a very different use rate. Indeed it is known that the use
rate of some pesticides may vary in the order of 10 or

<CLAIMS>
A containerisation system which comprises at
least one inner water soluble or water dispersible bag

containing a hazardous agrochemical composition in solid
form, characterised in that the containerisation system

further comprises an outer water soluble or water
dispersible bag containing another hazardous agrochemical

composition in solid form different from the first, the
outer bag also containing the inner bag with its content,

the material of the walls of the inner bag or bags and
the outer bag being completely soluble in water at a

temperature lower than 35Â°C.
A containerisation system according to claim 1
wherein the hazardous compositions and the wall of the

bags they contact are chosen so that the hazardous
compositions do not substantially dissolve the wall of

the bag they contact and do not substantially permeate
through it.
A containerisation system according to claim 1
or 2 wherein each of the hazardous compositions comprises

an agrochemical which is a plant protection agent,
pesticide, insecticide, fungicide, herbicide, acaricide,

nematocide, plant growth regulator or plant nutrient.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims,

wherein the hazardous compositions in the inner bag or
bags and the outer bag are incompatible.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims which comprises one or two inner

bags in the outer bag.
A containerisation system according to claim 5,
which comprises one inner bag in the outer bag.
A containerisation system according to any one 
of the preceding claims which comprises a further water

insoluble external container.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein the hazardous compositions

are in a concentrated form.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein the concentrations of

active ingredients in the hazardous compositions in the
bags are from 0.5 to 80% (w/w) of hazardous active

ingredient.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein one of the bags, either an

inner bag or the outer bag, floats when put into water and
the other, or its content, sinks when put into water.
A containerisation system according to claim
10, wherein the inner bag or bags float when put into water

and the outer bag sinks when put into water.
A containerisation system according to claim
10, wherein the inner bag or bags sink when put into water

and the outer bag floats when put into water.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein at least one bag contains

an agrochemical composition in the form of water wettable
powder or water dispersible granules.
A containerisation system according to claim
13, wherein the bag containing a wettable powder or water

dispersible granules floats when put into water.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the pre
ceding claims, wherein the outer bag, either with
its full content or with only the agrochemical composition

which is outside the inner bag, has a specific gravity
greater than 1 and the inner bag, with its content, has a

specific gravity less than 1.
A containerisation system according to any one
of claims 1 to 14, wherein the outer bag, either with its

full content or with only the agrochemical composition 
which is outside the inner bag, has a specific gravity less

than 1 and the inner bag, with its content, has a specific
gravity greater than 1.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein the weight ratio of the

agrochemicals contained respectively in the outer bag and
in the inner bag or bags is within 10% of the ratio of the

use rates of the agrochemicals contained respectively in
the outer bag and the inner bag or bags.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein the volume ratio of the

outer bag to the inner bag is more than 1.5:1.
A containerisation system according to claim
18, wherein the volume ratio of the outer bag to the inner

bag is more than 2:1.
A containerisation system according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein the inner bag contains a

marker.
