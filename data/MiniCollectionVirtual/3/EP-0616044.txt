Si, and a balance of Aℓ, in which the ratio of Mg/Cu is 
in the range of 2 to 7, homogenizing the ingot in one 

step or in multiple steps, performed at a temperature

3°C/sec. or more, keeping it for 0 to 60 seconds at 
the temperature reached, and cooling it to 100°C or 

less at a looking rate of 2°C/sec. or more, and keeping

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing an aluminum alloy sheet, more 
particularly, to a method of manufacturing an aluminum 
alloy sheet having excellent formability and excellent 
bake hardenability, having natural aging retardation 
property, and suitable for use in an automobile body 
sheet. A conventional surface-treated cold-rolled steel 
sheet has frequently been used as a sheet material for 
automobile body panel. In recent years, however, for 
the purpose of reducing fuel consumption, a light-weight 
automobile body panel material has been demanded. To 
satisfy the demand, an aluminum alloy sheet has begun 
being used for the automobile body panel. Nowadays, manufacturers in press forming of panel 
sheets are requesting that the material not only have 
low yield strength until being subjected to press 
forming so as to provide a satisfactory shape-retaining 
property [Jidosha Gijyutu (Automobile Technology), 
Vol. 45, No. 6 (1991), 45)], but also have a property 
such that strength thereof can improved during paint 
baking to provide satisfactory formability of deep 
drawing and overhang, and dent resistance. Under these circumstances, an attempt has been made 
in which the strength of the material was improved by 
adding Cu and Zn to a non-heat treated type, Aℓ-Mg based  
 
alloy which has superior formability to other aluminum 
alloys. As a result, an Aℓ-Mg-Cu alloy (Jpn. Pat. 
Appln. KOKAI Publication Nos. 57-120648, 1-225738), 
an Aℓ-Mg-Cu-Zn alloy (Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
No. 53-103914), and the like have been developed. These 
alloy sheets are superior to an Aℓ-Mg-Si alloy sheet but 
inferior to a conventional surface-treated cold-rolled 
steel sheet in formability, and exhibit a poor shape-retaining 
property since the alloy sheets have high 
strength prior to being press formed. In addition, the 
degree of hardening obtained by paint baking is not 
sufficient, and the degree of hardening is low only to 
prevent work hardening value obtained by press-forming 
from lowering. In Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
No. 57-120648, an attempt has been made to improve the 
strength at the time of the paint baking by precipitating 
an Aℓ-Cu-Mg compound; however, the results have not 
been satisfactory. Since the effect of Si in improving 
baking hardness was not yet discovered at the time the 
aforementioned application was made, Si was limited to a 
low level. A conventional 5052-0 material is used in the 
automobile body panel. Although it exhibits a superior
