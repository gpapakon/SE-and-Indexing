<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tuneable bisconjugate comprising 
two saccharides and a spacer, each saccharide 

being the same or different and comprising two to six 
monosaccharide units, at least one unit being uronic 

acid, characterized in that at least one of the saccharides 

per se
 has anti-thrombotic activity, and that the 
spacer connects at least one saccharide to the other 

through its non-reducing end, the chain length of the 
spacer being 20-120 atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to tuneable bisconjugates comprising
two saccharides and a spacer, to a process for
the preparation thereof, a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same, and a use of said bisconjugates
for the manufacture of a medicament.Antithrombotic bisconjugates comprising two saccharides
and a spacer are known from European patent application
312,086. The saccharide moieties of these compounds
contain sulfated galactopyranosyl, mannopyranosyl, or
glucopyranosyl units. These saccharides do not belong
to the class of glycosaminoglycans or glycosaminoglycanoids
such as disclosed in European patent application
529,715, which contain uronic acids. It is not
disclosed whether these saccharides per se show antithrombotic
activity. Moreover, only a spacer is disclosed
which has a very specific structure, and which
can have a chain length as small as 8 atoms, whereas it
is found that the bisconjugates of the present invention
are not active when they have a spacer chain
length smaller than 20 atoms. In addition, in the bisconjugates
disclosed in EP 312,086 the saccharides are
connected to the spacer through both their reducing
ends.The present invention relates to a tuneable bisconjugate
comprising two saccharides and a spacer, each
saccharide being the same or different and comprising
two to six monosaccharide units, at least one unit
being uronic acid, characterized in that at least one
of the saccharides per se has anti-thrombotic activity,
and that the spacer connects at least one saccharide to 
the other through its non-reducing end, the chain
length of the spacer being 20-120 atoms.It is known that small carbohydrate molecules of the
glycosaminoglycan type, are potent anti-Xa inhibitors.
See for instance European patent 84999. Later filed
patent applications showed that many variants of these
basic molecules have similar activities. It is nowadays
clear that these relatively small molecules (pentasaccharides
are typical examples) interact with only
one of the serine protease inhibitors, usually with
anti-thrombin III (AT-III). The activated saccharide
AT-III complex then inhibits selectively factor Xa.
From investigations with natural occurring heparin and
its fragments, it is known that longer glycosaminoglycans
are required for the AT-III mediated inactivation
of factor IIa (thrombin). Longer glycosaminoglycans
having at least 16 saccharide units show anti-Xa as
well as anti-IIa activity.
Practically it is not interesting to synthesize glycosaminoglycans
having 16 or more saccharide
