<ABSTRACT>
A WAN (106) is formed using Frame Relay Protocol and a telephone 
network interface unit. An originating LAN (100) sends a message to a router (140) 

which communicates with a telephone network interface (148) unit using Frame 
Relay Protocol. The telephone network interface unit determines the destination of a 

packet received from the router (140) by interpreting the Frame Relay Protocol, and 
it associates a phone number with that destination. The interface unit (148) uses the 

phone number to establish at least one DS0 connection over a digital telephone 
network (130) to a destination network interface (158). A destination network 

interface unit (158) receives the packet from the digital telephone network (130) and 
provides the packet to a router (150) which interfaces to the destination LAN (102). 

The network interface units add or drop additional DS0 channels as required by the 
traffic load and thereby provide variable bandwidth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communications, and more particularly, 
it relates to wide area networks. Wide area networks (WANs) often comprise local area networks 
(LANs) that are connected using routers, brouters or bridges. U.S. Patent 5,088,090 
entitled "Routing System to Interconnect Local Area Networks" describes a system 
that connects LANs. FIG. 1 illustrates a system where LAN 10 with data terminals 
12 is connected to LAN 20 with data terminals 22 via bridge or router 24. Routers, 
brouters and bridges are well known in the art and are commercially available from 
many vendors. Routers and bridges differ in that routers operate at the network layer 
level of the International Standards Organization (ISO) Open Systems 
Interconnection (OSI) reference model, and bridges operate at the data link layer of 
the OSI reference model. Brouters are devices capable of operating at the network 
layer level or the data link layer level. As it became desirable to connect more and more geographically 
dispersed LANs, WAN topologies developed. FIG. 2 illustrates a hub topology. 
LANs 30, 32, 34 and 36 comprise terminals 38, 40, 42 and 44, respectively. Each 
LAN is remotely located and is connected to the center of the hub via a two-port 
router 46 and telephone network 47. Since routers 46 only contain two ports, they 
are relatively inexpensive pieces of equipment. The center of the hub comprises 
large router 48. Router 48 has many ports and passes packets of information from a 
router in a source spoke to a router in a destination spoke. This type of a topology 
has the disadvantage of using a large router with many ports; routers with a large 
number of ports are relatively expensive. Additionally, a failure of router 48 will 
disable the entire WAN. FIG. 3 illustrates another prior art WAN. This arrangement uses a 
digital telephone network, such as a switch 56 network, to connect several LANs. 
This WAN connects LANs 60, 62 and 64 using digital telephone network 66. LAN 
60 is connected to digital telephone network 66 via router 68 and inverse multiplexer 
70. Link 72 connects LAN 60 and router 68, and router ports 74, 76, 78 and 79 
connect router 68 to inverse multiplexer 70. Inverse multiplexer 70 is connected to 
digital telephone network 66 via a T1 facility. Similarly, LAN 62 is connected to 
digital telephone network 66 through router 80 and inverse multiplexer 82. LAN 62  
 
is connected to router 80 by link 84, and router ports 86, 88, 90 and 92 connect 
router 80 to inverse multiplexer
