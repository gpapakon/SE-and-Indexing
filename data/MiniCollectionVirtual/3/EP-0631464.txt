<ABSTRACT>
A seed firming wheel assembly (66) is supported in close-coupled relationship with the rear portion of the paired discs (36, 38) of an opener (30) to gently press deposited seeds down into the bottom of a V-shaped trench formed by the discs (36, 38). The mounting arm (94) of the assembly (66) is configured in a manner to minimize the accumulation of mud and trash residue, while the wheel (130) itself may take the form of a solid, circular block of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene with slick sides (218) to reduce soil adherence or a spoked, molded plastic wheel (118) having open spaces (134) between the spokes to permit soil pass-through.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GRAIN DRILL UNIT HAVING SEED FIRMING WHEELTechnical FieldThis invention relates to grain drills and, more particularly, to a seed firming wheel assembly which accompanies the double-disc opener of such a drill for gently pressing deposited seeds down into the loose soil at the bottom of a trench formed by the two discs of the opener■>BackgroundAfter seeds have been deposited in a trench formed by a pair of opener discs, it is desirable to press the seeds gently down into the soil at the bottom of the trench before the trench is then covered over with soil by the trailing press wheel. A variety of small firming wheels have heretofore been provided by various manufacturers for accomplishing this function.However, one nagging problem associated with currently available firming wheels is the accumulation of trash residue and mud in and around the firming wheels. When the buildup of this type of material becomes great enough, it will actually interfere with the rolling action of the wheel and may cause it to stop rolling all together, turning the wheel into more of a gouging device than something that gives the seed its final setting into place.-Bmninary of the Invention Accordingly, one important object of the present invention is to provide a seed firming wheel assembly, particularly usable in connection with the paired opening discs of a grain drill, which gently yet firmly presses the deposited seeds into the soil at the bottom of the trench prepared by the discs while minimiz- 

ing the opportunity for the collection and buildup of trash crop residue and mud. More particularly, in an opener in which there is a press wheel which trails the firming wheel and the press wheel is utilized as a means for gauging the depth of the discs, it is an important aim of the invention to provide for gentle firming action on the part of the seed firming wheel without causing the firming wheel to take over the depth gauging function of the press wheel. In other words, an important consider- ation is to provide a firming wheel which is capable of carrying out its delicate seed firming function without adversely affecting the ability of the press wheel to carry out its depth gauging function.Pursuant to the foregoing, the present inven- tion contemplates having a seed firming wheel assembly which is mounted in a close-coupled relationship with the rear extremities of the paired discs so that there is little, if any, space behind the discs for trash and mud to accumulate on the wheel assembly. In order to accomplish this

Claims
1. In a double-disc opener for use with a grain drill having a main frame, the improvement compris¬ ing: an elongated, normally fore-and-aft extending sub- frame having a front end; means adjacent said front end of the sub-frame for pivotally mounting the sub-frame on the main frame of the drill for up and down swinging movement; a pair of side-by-side discs rotatably carried by said sub-frame behind the mounting means and converging slightly downwardly and forwardly for opening a trench in the soil as the opener is advanced; seed deposit means on the sub-frame for releasing seeds into the trench formed by the discs; a trailing press wheel carried by said sub-frame behind the seed deposit means at a selected vertical position relative to the sub-frame for gauging the depth of penetration of the discs into the soil and for covering the trench with soil after seeds have been deposited; and a seed firming wheel assembly carried by the sub- frame between the seed deposit means and the press wheel and including a firming wheel positioned for rolling movement in the trench to gently sink the deposited seeds into the soil at the bottom of the trench, 



 said assembly including spring means yieldably biasing the firming wheel toward a lowermost operating position with a level of force which is insufficient to cause the firming wheel to support the weight of the opener during opera¬ tion and transfer the depth gauging function from the press wheel to the firming wheel.
2. In a double-disc opener as claimed in Claim 1, said firming wheel being positioned to project forwardly into a space formed between the discs while a rear portion of the firming wheel projects rearwardly behind the discs.
3. In a double-disc opener as claimed in Claim 2, said assembly including an arm pivoted intermediate a pair of opposite ends thereof for up and down swinging movement about a transverse pivot located below the sub-frame and between the discs, said arm having said spring located at one of said opposite ends and the firming wheel at the other of said opposite ends.
4. In a double-disc opener as claimed in Claim 3, said arm having an arcuately downturned section adjacent said other end thereof which generally matches the arcuate contour of said discs along a trailing portion of the discs. 


 5. In a double-disc opener as claimed in Claim 1, said firming wheel comprising a substantially solid, circular disc constructed from ultra-high- molecular-weight polyethylene.
6. In a double-disc opener as claimed in Claim 1, said firming wheel having an annular outer rim, a circular center hub, and a plurality of radial¬ ly extending, circumferentially spaced spokes interconnecting the hub and the rim.
7. In a double-disc opener having a pair of generally downwardly and forwardly converging discs which prepare a seed trench in the soil as the opener is advanced, an improved seed firming wheel assembly comprising: an arm pivotally mounted between the discs for up and down swinging movement about a transverse axis located behind the axes of rotation of the discs, said arm being provided with means yieldably biasing a rear section of the arm in a downward direc- tion; and a firming wheel rotatably supported on said rear section of the arm in such a position that a front portion of the firming wheel projects into a space defined between the two discs at the rear thereof while a rear portion of the firming wheel projects rearwardly beyond the discs, whereby to reduce the accumulation of trash and residue on the firming wheel during operation. 


 8. In a double-disc opener as claimed in Claim 7, said rear section of the arm including a generally upright, flat surface located beside a normally upper area of the firming wheel, said flat surface of the arm section being twisted out of a plane parallel to the plane of rota¬ tion of the firming wheel and into a plane diverging forwardly away from the firming wheel with respect to the normal direction of rota¬ tion of the firming wheel during use, whereby extraneous materials entering into the space between the firming wheel and the surface of the arm section tend to release themselves during rotation of the wheel.
