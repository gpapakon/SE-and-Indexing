<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sprayable analgesic
compositions. More particularly,
the invention pertains to
compositions for oral administration of
analgesic compounds by absorption through the buccal
mucosa.Topical application of analgesic compositions, i.e.,
by application to and absorption through the skin, is
known. For example, the composition for topical
application of a salicylate emulsion foot spray is
disclosed in a patent to Modderno (U.S. 2,975,097).Sprayable topical analgesic anti-inflammatory
compositions for treating skin rashes, etc. are disclosed
in the Saitoh, et al. patent (U.S. 4,775,667).Aerosol compositions for inhalation therapy,
containing analgesics which are absorbed in the bronchioles
and alveoli are disclosed in the patent to Porush, et al.
(U.S. 2,868,691).Liquid analgesics for oral administration are also
known. For example, see the patent to Haas (U.S.
4,861,797) which discloses palatable liquid ibuprofen
compositions. Sprayable compositions consisting of an arylalkanoic derivative possessing analgesic
properties and a solvent, preferably a lower aliphatic alcohol are disclosed in US-A-4,704,406.
These compositions are used topically "in closed proximity" of the site of an
inflammation. The administration takes place in any case through the skin and not
through a mucosa, particularly not through the buccal mucosa.A sprayable analgesic composition for use on the buccal and vaginal mucosa is
disclosed in NL-A-9000237. However this composition is for treating topically ulcerative
and erosive diseases of these mucosa. This document does not teach the introduction
of the analgesic in the bloodstream thanks to this administration route.The introduction of an analgesic in the bloodstream by administering an analgesic
composition through a mucous membrane in the form of a sublingual tablet or of a
nebulizer solution is disclosed in GB-A-1,209,849. A nebulizer solution distinguishes
from a sprayable solution in that it must be inhaled.The sublingual administration of buprenorphine in the form of sublingual administrable
liquid compositions is similarly disclosed in EP-A-0 069 600. It would be highly advantageous to provide
compositions in buccal absorption methods for
administering analgesics, because such use and methods
could be much more convenient for use by the general
public, when it is not practical to use tabletted or
swallowed liquid compositions. Moreover, compositions and
methods for buccal mucosa administration of analgesics
would be especially useful to persons who have
