<ABSTRACT>
A unique feeder (10) for birds and animals of the type 
forming part of a modern automated feeding system (12) used to 

minimize the operating costs associated with commercial breeding. 
The feeder assembly (10) comprises feeder tube means (32), a pan 

member (38) and may include cone means (34) loosely surrounding 
the feeder tube (32) for controlling the pattern and amount of 

feed presented in the pan (38). Indexing means (75) and visual 
indication means (55) may also be provided for enabling the 

preselection of the size of a lower feed gate (62) which 
automatically results when the feeder (10) is suspended above a 

feeding surface (30) and providing constant indication of the 
size selected, respectively. A brood gate (60) may also be 

provided which is designed to automatically close upon elevation 
of the feeder (10) above a feeding surface (30), but which can 

also be locked open when so desired. The unique feeder (10) may 
also include rotatable coupling means (84) to engage and 

disengage the pan member (38) and a barrier means (36) by simply 
rotating one with respect to the other. The barrier means (36) 

is designed to facilitate the egress of birds or animals which 
might otherwise be trapped inside the feeder (10) and make 

ingress more difficult than egress. Moreover, the feeder (10) is 
preferably provided with a hanger means (102, 104, 106) to enable 

simultaneous suspension of the pan (38) from the barrier means 
(36) upon disengagement therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to feeding systems for 
poultry and the like, and more particularly to the 
feeder assemblies used in conjunction therewith. In today's competitive marketplace, most animal 
husbandmen attempt to reduce the operating costs 
associated with the commercial breeding of domestic 
birds and animals by utilizing automated feeding systems 
designed to minimize the amount of labor needed to carry 
out daily feeding procedures. A modern automated 
feeding system of the type referred to usually comprises 
a bulk feed storage facility connected to a system of 
transport conduits which are equipped with means for 
conveying feed through the conduits and into the 
individual feeder assemblies. In poultry feeding 
applications, a single feeder should ideally be able to 
accommodate various types and sizes of birds thus 
eliminating the need and expense required to change 
feeders. The feeder assemblies should also be designed 
to minimize feed waste and discourage birds from bodily  
 
entering the feeder assemblies and contaminating the 
feed contained therein. Examples of prior art feeder assemblies of the general 
type to which this invention is directed are disclosed in 
United States Patent Nos. 3,230,933; 3,388,690; 
3,511,215; 3,811,412; 3,911,868; 4,070,990; 4,476,811; 
4,834,026 and United States Patent Application No. 
302,015. The feeders shown in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,230,933; 
3,388,690 and 4,476,811 disclose, among other things, 
the aspect of providing a wire barrier to prevent 
consuming poultry from physically climbing into the 
feeder apparatus. Because of the shape and 
configuration of the barriers shown, however, birds 
which force their way into the feeder apparatus can 
become trapped inside. Another aspect shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,476,811 is that of a brood gate opening 
defined in the drop tube member to permit feed to flow 
from a transport conduit, through the opening, and into 
an outer portions of the pan for consumption by poultry 
which are newly-hatched and/or not yet large enough to 
feed from the interiors of the pan. When the '811 
feeder is raised above a feeding surface as shown in 
Figs. 4 and 5 of the '811 patent, the brood gate 
automatically closes. The brood gate shown in U.S. 
Patent Application No. 302,015, however, can be opened 
and closed whether or not the feeder assembly shown 
therein is raised above a feeding surface or resting 
thereon, but will not automatically close and open. Except with respect to those aspects specifically 
disc

<CLAIMS>
A feeder assembly (10) comprising: a feeder tube (32) 
operatively associated with a feed conveyor (18, 20, 22, 24); a feed pan 

(38) for providing access to the feed having a substantially circular 
perimeter (92) of predetermined diameter; and a cage-like grill member 

(36) having a central hub portion (44) and a series of spoke members 
(46) extending from said central hub (44) to a substantially circular lower 

perimeter portion of the grill (48) which has a diameter similar to the 
diameter of said circular perimeter (92) of said feed pan (38), said spoke 

members (46) having a cross-sectional shape throughout virtually their 
entire extent which is of a greater dimension towards the exterior of the 

feeder (10), and of a lesser dimension towards the interior, the 
combination of said spoke members (46), said pan (38) and said feeder 

tube (32) defining a substantially rectangular, annular interior region of 
the feeder (10) which is easier for birds or animals to climb out of than 

to climb into. 
A feeder assembly (10) as recited in Claim 1, wherein the spoke 
members (46) define a substantially inverted L-shaped profile. 
A feeder assembly (10) as recited in Claim 1, wherein a cross-section 
of at least some of said spoke members (46) is substantially T-shape 

with the top of the T-shape facing to the exterior of the feeder (10). 
A feeder assembly (10) as recited in Claim 1, wherein said
