<ABSTRACT>
White light is irradiated onto the surface of a 
solid or liquid, so that one wavelength of the reflected 

light is linearly polarised and filtered out by an 
analyser. The reflected light is thus coloured by 

partial extinction to thereby allow differences of film 
thickness and/or refractive index to be observed by 

colour difference. Enhanced sensitivity, through an 
increased colour difference, is achieved by reflecting 

the reflected light back onto the surface of the same 
solid or liquid again. Repeating this re-incidence more 

than once produces an increased colour difference. 
The method allows the discerning of film thickness 
and refractive index distribution, the observation of 

liquid surfaces, and the observation of surface 
phenomena on a real time basis by the difference in 

colour.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
observing film thickness and/or refractive index by
colour difference. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a method for observing film
thickness and/or refractive index by colour difference
which is useful in the development and evaluation of new
materials, and in the observation of the refractive
index of a solid or liquid surface in various industrial
areas including electronics, the refractive index of a
thin film on the surface of a solid or a liquid, and
changes in film thickness as well as two dimensional
distributions of film thickness.The study of the condition of a surface is very
important in the development and evaluation of new
materials, and in the electronics industry. In the
production of silicon oxide film on a silicon wafer
board, for example, two dimensional film thickness
distribution for the silicon oxide film must be
confirmed by surface analysis to a precision in the
order of a nanometer.It is thus necessary to observe film thickness,
and further, refractive index, of a solid or a liquid as
a two dimensional distribution or a dynamic change.Conventional surface analysis methods, most of
which derive from a scanning microscope, include Auger,
ESCA, and EPMA, which are useful for local detection or
identification of materials, and material analysis.Secondary ion mass spectrography (SIMS), which is
one of the conventional methods, is used to measure
material distribution in the depth direction.However, only the optical methods provide a way of
evaluating film thickness and optical properties to a
high degree of precision, whatever the materials may be. The optical methods include the technique of
measuring the intensity of transmitted and fluorescent
light, but the most reliable way of measuring film
thickness is to use an ellipsometer.Several types of ellipsometer have been developed
in recent years to allow for the dynamic measurement of
two-dimensional distributions of film thickness and/or
refractive index of a thin film on the surface of a
material. These ellipsometers are used very often in
various methods today. The ellipsometric method may be
classified into two types, as follows:
(1) A method to measure two-dimensional
distribution by measuring the film thickness and
refractive index of a sample using a light beam which is
squeezed into a spot of the order of 10 Âµm in diameter,
while moving the sample over a plane (M. Erman and J.B.
Theeten, J. Appl. Phys., 60, 859 [1986]); and(2) A method to record multiple images

<CLAIMS>
A method of observing film thickness and/or
refractive index, wherein light from a white light

source is irradiated onto the surface of a solid or
liquid, and the film thickness or refractive index

is determined on the basis of the partial
extinction of the reflected light, the colour of

the reflected light being used as an indication of
said film thickness and/or refractive index.
The method of claim 1, wherein the light is
reflected from the surface more than once.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the film
thickness and/or refractive index distribution

across the surface is determined on the basis of
differences in the colour of the light reflected

from the different thickness and/or different
refractive index regions of the surface.
