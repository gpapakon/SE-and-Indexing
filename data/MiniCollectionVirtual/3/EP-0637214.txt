<ABSTRACT>
Dredger for fine table salt, with rotatable closing cap (3) provided with internal means adapted to avoid any clogging of the dispensing holes (8) and the adjoining clotting of salt, characterized in that said means comprises substantially a stationary undercap (2) with a wide passage opening which is limited at the top level by a flexible crossmember (6) or flexible projections carrying upwardly-protruding bosses (7) which, upon manual rotation of the cap (3), possibly also having on its inner side one or more tips (15) against clotting, will loosen the salt tending to obstruct the dispensing holes (8) of the cap, said holes, thanks to said bosses (7) in register and elastic contact therewith, being simultaneously cleared to permit salt to be dispensed in due course.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dredger for fine table salt,
comprising a container provided with a rotatable closing cap
equipped therein with means capable of avoiding any clogging of
the dispensing holes.
US-A-3 228 569 described a dredger having the the features of the
preamble of claim 1.Generally, it is known that the drawback of all dispensers
for fine table salt, or salt dredgers, usually marketed in various
shapes, is that, after a certain time from replenishment with new
salt, as a result of the tendency of salt to become clotted due to
humidity, they do not permit the salt therein to be dispensed in
due course. Therefore, the perforated closing cap must be unscrewed
and cleaned internally to remove the clotted salt, which operation
is simple but tiresome and is unpleasant to operators of public
restaurants due to the claims from the customers. Often, the salt
is dispensed unevenly, or excessively due to the repeated shaking
of the salt dredger, thus spoiling the food.The aim of the invention is to obviate this drawbacks. This
is achieved by a dredger as defined in claims 1 and 6. The
dependent claims define particular embodimentsThe article proposed by the invention is the result of
improvements made on the spur of said drawbacks and is adapted to
advantageously eliminate them. Substantially, the container of the
salt dredger thus developped comprises a manually rotatable closing
cap having a series of dispensing holes orderly arranged
circumferentially, and adapted to be mounted on an undercap made
of resilient material and fixedly snap-mounted on the open end of
said body of the container. The top of the undercap is formed with
a wide passage opening, and the edge thereof is provided, at the
top level, with inwardly-directed flexible projections carrying
upwardly protruding bosses which, when these members (i.e. cap and 
undercap) are assembled, will rub elastically against the inner
mouths of the dispensing holes to clear them, also be an ejecting
action, of the salt that has possibly clogged said holes. In
addition, the cap may be provided on the inner side thereof with
one or more tips or other projections which, by penetrating the
salt in the container, will loosen or crumble it if clotted to
render it flowable again, which action is obtained simultaneously
by rotating the cap with respect to the container.The accompanying drawings show, as a non-limiting example, a
basic embodiment of the article according to the invention, as well
as some possible advantageous and exemplary modifications.

<CLAIMS>
A dredger for fine table salt, with a rotatable closing cap (3) (10)
provided with internal means adapted to avoid any clogging of the

dispensing holes (8) and the adjoining clotting of salt, comprising
a containing body (1) made of glass or similar material, characterized

in that said means substantially comprises an undercap (2) (11) of moulded
elastic material to be fixedly mounted on the mouth of the

container (1), having at the level of its top plane and at the edge of
its wide passage opening, one or more flexible projections (6, 16) each

carrying a hemispherical boss (7) designed to operate in register with
and in elastic contact against a series of dispensing holes (8)

disposed circumferentially and in register therewith in the top
wall of the closing cap (3) (10) which is suitably adapted to be mounted on

said undercap so as to permit its manual rotation.
A dredger according to claim 1, characterized in that in order
to loosen the salt that has clotted in proximity of the mouth of

the container and possibly in the dispensing holes of the closing
cap, said cap (3) (10) is rotatably mounted on a stationary undercap (11)

provided with flexible projections carrying hemispherical bosses (7)
which protrude from the level of the top plane of the undercap (11) to

act elastically against the inner mouths of the dispensing holes (8)
in the cap (10), said holes being slightly flaring.
A dredger according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
it comprises a perforated closing cap (3, 10) rotatably mounted on a

stationary undercap (2, 11) which, being made of resilient material and
being provided with protrusions (7) in register with the dispensing

holes (8) in the cap (3, 10), soon as said cap in rotated manually it can
produce an action capable of loosening the salt that has become 

clotted near the holes and of ejecting it from said holes, thus
clearing the passages therefor.
A dredger according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the perforated and rotatable cap (3, 10) comprises internal tips (15)

having a certain height which pass beyond the central area of the
undercap (2, 11), whose crossmember is suitably interrupted for this

purpose, and penetrate the salt to act as a means against the
clotting of said salt.
A dredger according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
said tips within the cap consist in a single diametrical

spatula-like projection (17) secured to said cap.
A dredger according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
the tips (15, 17) against clotting are arranged on the inner side of a

rotating member (3, 10) and pass through a central portion
of the undercap (2).
A dredger comprising
a container body (14)

having a tubular shape opened at both ends, the
bottom end being closed by a rotatable cap (13) actuatable manually,

the opposite end wherefrom the salt is dispensed being closed by a
stationary cap (10) perforated circumferentially having therebelow a

disc-like rotatable member (11) with a central opening crossed over by
a crossmember carrying a pair of protruding bosses (7) and inwardly

protruding tips (11) against clotting, said rotatable member (11) being
actuatable through a small rod (12) by said bottom cap (13).
