<ABSTRACT>
A gasoline additive composition is disclosed 
comprising at least one of trimethylolpropane-tri-(2-ethylhexanoate) 

and diisodecyl adipate, and at 
least one dispersant component selected from (i) a 

mixture of a monosuccinimide, and a bissuccinimide, 
(ii) an alkylamine of average molecular weight 500-5000 

having a polyolefine polymer as an alkyl group, 
and (iii) a benzylamine derivative of average 

molecular weight 500-5000. The composition further 
comprises a lubricant oil fraction of viscosity in 

the range 3-35mm²/s (100°C), and may optionally 
include a polyoxyalkylene glycol, or a derivative 

thereof. 
The composition has utility in preventing or 
reducing undesired deposits on the surfaces of 

intake valves of an automobile engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a divisional application of application 
no. 91305128.0. This invention concerns a gasoline additive composition 
and, in particular, a gasoline additive composition which 
considerably reduces deposits in the intake valves of 
automobile engines. In the prior art, some compounds such as polyalkenyl 
succinimide and hydroxypolyether polyamine are known as 
cleaning agents for automobile carburetors and engines. In 
addition, dispersions or solutions of polyalkenyl succinimide 
and oxy compounds in organic solvents such as xylene are 
known as gasoline additive compositions. These substances 
however were not fully satisfactory. An object of this invention is to improve gasoline 
additive compositions. A further object of this invention is to provide a 
gasoline additive composition which in particular can 
considerably reduce deposits in the intake valves of engines. Other objects of this invention will become apparent 
from the following description. This invention, as the first aspect, includes a gasoline 
additive composition comprising an ester; and at least one 
dispersant component chosen from the group consisting of a 
monosuccinimide represented by the general formula (I) below, 
a bissuccinimide represented by the general formula (II) 
below, an alkylamine of average molecular weight 500 - 5000 
having a polyolefine polymer as an alkyl group and a 
benzylamine derivative of average molecular weight 500 - 5000 
represented by the general formula (III) below:  wherein R₁ is an olefine oligomer group with no less than 30 
carbon atoms, R₂ is an alkylene group with 2 to 4 carbon 
atoms, and m is an integer of 1 - 10, 
wherein each of R₃ and R₃' is olefine oligomer group with no 
less than 30 carbon atoms, R₄ is an alkylene group with 2 to 
4 carbon atoms provided that the multiple R₄ groups may by 
the same as or different from each other, and n is an integer 
of 0 - 10, 
wherein R is an alkyl group derived from a polyolefine 
polymer of average molecular weight 500 - 4500, R' is an 
alkylene group, and p is an integer of 1 - 10. This invention, as the second aspect, includes a 
gasoline additive composition comprising the above 
composition together with a polyoxyalkylene glycol or its 
derivative.  This invention can further contain a lubricant oil 
fraction of viscosity in the range 3 mm²/s - 35 mm²/s (100°C). In the gasoline additive composition of this invention, 
the succinimide, alkylamine or benzylamine derivative 
exhibits the property of preventing undesired deposits
