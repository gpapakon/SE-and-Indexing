<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a roof ridge sealing strip (1) with a central bonded fabrics region (8) permitting air to pass through and two edge regions (8) which can be adapted to the wave shape of the roofing plates (6) and have an elastic stabilisation insert (S); to obtain a particularly easy to lay strip it is proposed that the stabilisation insert (S) take the form of sinusoidal wires (13) or strips (11) running parallel to the edge (10').

Roof ridge sealing strip (1) with a central zone 
(D) of a non-woven structure and permitting the passage 

of air, and two lateral strips (90) extending in a 
corrugated fashion in a longitudinal direction, and which 

are adaptable to the corrugated shape of the laid roofing 

panels (60) as a result of a stretchable stabilising 
insert (S) of metal or the like, the two lateral strips 

(90) being connected in the area of two connecting zones 
(C) with a central connecting strip (80) in the form of a 

non-woven fabric, in such a way that the inner edges 
(130) of the lateral strips (80) lie at a spacing from 

one another, characterised in that the overlapping 
connecting zones (C) have air passage ducts (140) lying 

in the direction of the width. 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the air passage ducts (140) are 

formed from a linear contact of the peaks of the 
corrugation of the longitudinally-corrugated lateral 

strips (90) with the smoothly-extending connecting strips 
(80). 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the width of the 

connecting strip (80) corresponds approximately to the 
width of a ridge batten (40).  

 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the connecting 

strip (80) has an adhesive layer on the underside. 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the connecting 

strip (80) lies upon the upper side (100) of the lateral 
strip (90). 
Roof ridge sealing strip (1) according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised by meandering corrugated 

wires (13) or bands (11) extending parallel to the edge 
(10'), and which are secured in a securing means 

permitting a variation in the meandering configuration on 
the wide surface of the non-woven material (10). 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the stabilising 

insert (S), stretchable due to the meandering 
configuration of a wire (160, 160') is secured via the 

adhesive beads (150) to the lateral strip (90). 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of claims 
6 or 7, characterised in that the stretchable stabilising 

insert (S) consists of a wire (13) bent in a meandering 
configuration parallel to the surface of the non-woven 

material (10).  
 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of claims 
6 or 7, characterised in that the stretchable stabilising 

insert (S) consists of a band (11) corrugated in a 
meandering configuration perpendicular to the surface of 

the non-woven material (10). 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of claims 
6 to 9, characterised in that the meandering 

configuration of the wire (160') is in the same direction 
as the configuration of the corrugation of the lateral 

strip (90). 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of claims 
5 to 10, characterised in that the wire (160') is 

reversibly embedded in the adhesive beads (150). 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the connecting 

strip (80') has on the underside, on its central 
longitudinal line, humps (190) consisting of compressible 

material, as attachment points (180) for roof ridge 
battens. 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the humps (190) consist of adhesive 

material, and have a foil covering (200) on their upper 
side.  

 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the upper side 

(100) of each lateral strip (90) has an elastic 
protective layer (110), which extends from the external 

lateral edge (120) approximately to the centre of the 
lateral strip (90). 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised by two longitudinal bent 

lines (210) at a spacing from the longitudinal central 
line. 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to claim 15, 
characterised in that the longitudinal bent lines (210) 

lie in the area of the corrugation. 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of claims 
15 or 16, characterised in that the longitudinal bent 

lines (210) are produced by pressing out the depressions 
of the corrugations (220) as far as the height of the 

peaks of the corrugations (230). 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that partial areas of 

the non-woven material (10) are impregnated, e.g. by 
means of acrylic resin, in order to obtain a waterproof 

condition with simultaneous permeability to air.  
 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to claim 18, 
characterised in that the lateral areas (9) of the non-woven 

material (10) are needle bonded. 
Roof ridge sealing strip according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised by a longitudinal 

corrugated configuration of the non-woven material (10) 
provided in the lateral areas (9).
