<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
transmit/receive apparatus (facsimile apparatus)
comprising a sorter (recording sheet sorting device).A facsimile apparatus or image forming apparatus
comprising a sorter is known from, e.g., Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. 57-95755, 56-120258, 1-203168 (USP
5,050,860, filed on Sep. 24, 1991) and 61-23083 (USP
4,854,572, filed on Aug. 8, 1989).A conventional sorter has a poor versatility, and
cannot be attached to various types of facsimile
apparatuses. For this reason, the type of sorter which
can be attached is limited, or conversely, a facsimile
apparatus to which the sorter can be attached is
limited. Document JP-A-03 162 364 discloses an information
transmit/receive apparatus onto which a sensor can be
mounted. The apparatus comprises a printer which may be
provided with a sheet feed portion and a sheet discharge
portion adjacent to which a first sheet sensor is disposed.
The information transmit/receive apparatus further comprises
an original reader with a sheet feed portion and a sheet
discharge portion. In addition, a sorter is provided which
has a sheet entrance port, a second sheet sensor and a
controller for controlling the movement of the sorter.
Furthermore, the sorter is connected to the sheet discharge
portion of the printer via an adapter which couples the sheet
discharge portion and the sheet entrance port together.
Finally, the sorter and the original reader are controlled by
a controller such that a receive operation and a transmit
operation are performed.Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to
provide an information transmit/receive apparatus which has
an improved control allowing the fast recognition of the
position of the sheet of paper being fed.According to the invention, this object is achieved by
providing the adapter with a path connecting the sheet
discharge portion of the printer and the sheet entrance port
of the sorter. Furthermore, the adapter also has a sheet
passage detection sensor transmitting directly to the
controller its signal informing that the sheet is in the path
of the adapter. As described above, according to the present
invention, in the information transmit/receive
apparatus comprising a sorter, since the information
transmit/receive apparatus is connected to the sorter
via the adapter, they can be connected independently of
the type of apparatus, and the versatility can be
improved. When the adapter is provided with a cover
having a transparent portion through which the
recording sheet passage
