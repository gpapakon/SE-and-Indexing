<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of immunologically 
assaying human osteocalcin in a human assay 
sample, which permits diagnosis of the conditon of metabolism 
of bones, a reagent therefor, an antibody to human 
osteocalcin, a hybridoma producing it, a method of producing 
it, and a series of techniqiues utilizing an 
antibody therefor. More specifically, this invention 
relates to a series of techniques by which a very trace 
amount of intact human osteocalcin or its fragment which 
can be contained in a human assay sample can be assayed 
distinguishably. Osteocalcin is a vitamin K-dependent bone 
calcium binding protein also called bone gla protein 
(BGP). Particularly, human osteocalcin is a relatively 
small protein composed of 49 amino acids and having a 
molecular weight of 5800. This protein is produced from osteoblast, and 
occupies about 20 % of the constituent components of 
non-collagen protein of the bones. This protein contains 
gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues and has a strong 
affinity for hydroxyapatite, and it is therefore presumed 
to have an important role in the formation of the bone 
matrices. Osteocalcin was first discovered from bones of 
chicken and bovine (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., U. S. A., Vol. 
72, No. 10, pp. 3925 - 3929 (October 1975), and ibid., 
Vol. 73, pp 1447 - 1451 (May 1975)]. Thereafter, the 
human osteocalcin was isolated, and its amino acid sequence  
 
was determined [The Journal of Biological 
Chemistry, Vol 255, No. 18, pp. 8685 - 8691, (1980)]. 
This literature shows the amino acid sequence of human 
osteocalcin in comparison with those of calf and swordfish, 
and shows that these osteocalcins have considerably 
similar structures. On the other hand, the following reports were 
made on the assay of human osteocalcin. P. A. Price et al. reported in this literature 
that assaying of human osteocalcin in a human plasma 
sample by radioimmunoassay by using a rabbit antibody to 
bovine, and stated that this rabbit antibody recognizes 
the C-terminal region of bovine osteocalcin. P. A. Price et al., in this publication, 
assayed human osteocalcin in a human plasma sample by 
radioimmunoassay by using a rabbit antibody to bovine 
osteocalcin as in the above literature, and recognized 
that a patient with a bone disease has an increased 
amount of osteocalcin as compared with a normal healthy 
person. P. D. Deimas in this literature examined the 
relation between the age of women and the amount of 
osteocalcin, and with showed age, the amount of osteocalcinan 
incre
