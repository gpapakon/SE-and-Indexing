<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the growth of
epitaxial silicon carbide films at low temperatures using
trimethylsilane as the source gas in a chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) process.Epitaxial silicon carbide is useful in many
high temperature, high power and high frequency
semiconductor device applications because of properties
such as a wide bandgap, high saturated electron drift
velocity, high breakdown electric field, high thermal
conductivity, and good chemical resistance. However,
most fabrication processes require the formation of
single crystal silicon carbide films. Normally, these
films are grown by CVD at temperatures above 1000°C. For
instance, Learn et al., Appl. Phys. Let., Vol. 17, No. 1,
July 1970, teach the formation of cubic silicon carbide
on alpha (6H) and beta (3C) silicon carbide substrates by
the reactive evaporation or reactive sputtering of
silicon in acetylene at temperatures as low as 1100°C.
Similarly, Steckl and Li, IEEE Transactions on Electronic
Devices, Vol. 39, No. 1, Jan. 1992, describe the
formation of beta (3C) silicon carbide films on
carbonized silicon (100) by rapid thermal CVD of silane
and propane at 1100-1300°C.Other investigators have also demonstrated the
deposition of 3C silicon carbide films from organosilicon
precursors. For instance, Takahashi et al., J.
Electrochem. Soc., Vol 139, No. 12, Dec. 1992, disclose
the formation of 3C silicon carbide on Si(100) and
Si(111) substrates (with and without a carbonized layer)
by atmospheric pressure CVD using hexamethyldisilane and
hydrogen gas mixtures at temperatures of 1100°C. Golecki et al., Appl. Phys. Lett, 60 (14), April
1992, reveal the formation of cubic silicon carbide on
silicon (100) substrates by low pressure CVD using
methylsilane at substrate temperatures as low as 750°C. The
process described therein, however, is solely limited to the
use of methylsilane as the precursor gas.The use of trimethylsilane to form amorphous or
polycrystalline silicon carbide films is also known in the
art. For instance, Kaplan et al. in U.S. Patent No.
3,843,399 teach the formation of silicon carbide coatings on
video disks using trimethylsilane in a glow discharge CVD
process. Similarly, Japanese Kokai Patent Publication 52-14600
forms silicon carbide films on a variety of substrates
using an alkylsilane in a glow discharge chemical vapor
deposition process. Likewise, Edno et al. in U.S. Patent
No. 4,532,150 details the formation of silicon carbide
coatings using an organosilicon compound in a plasma
enhanced CVD
