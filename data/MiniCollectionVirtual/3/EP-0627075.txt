<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for analysis of liquids such as beer comprises an evaporator to introduce the liquid to be analysed into the vapour phase, and near infrared analysis apparatus to determine the solute content of the liquids. By the use of vapour phase analysis, the analytical performance of the apparatus with respect to the content of liquid such as alcohol is greatly improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
analysing liquids. A particular example of the application
of the invention is to the analysis of the alcohol content of
liquids such as beer, wine etc. The invention may also find
application to analysis of the solute content of other
solutions, such as ammonia in water.The brewing industry requires accurate methods of
measuring the alcohol content of beer produced, as duty is
charged on beer on the basis of the alcohol content.
Furthermore, the recent increase in the popularity of "low-alcohol"
and "no-alcohol" beers has lead to a need for
accurate control of the alcohol content at very low alcohol
levels. Accordingly, the industry needs to be able to measure
alcohol content at levels as low as, for example, 0.5%, and
with an accuracy of 0.07%.Previous proposals for the measurement of alcohol content
in beer have included the use of near infra-red analysis
apparatus employing transmission cells containing the beer to
be analysed. Such methods are however mathematically complex
and do not provide the required level of accuracy. They
stretch the technology of near infra-red liquid analysis to
its limits, and are almost certainly not adequate for the
measurement of alcohol content in low-alcohol beers. A
further factor is that this approach to the analysis is
inevitably laboratory-based. Nevertheless, to-date it has
been long accepted that this is the best that can be done.The requirements of the brewing industry as discussed
above include a need for apparatus and a method capable of
providing substantially continuous monitoring of alcohol
content, including measurement at the low levels of alcohol
mentioned above, which are applicable to the production of
beer on a continuous basis in an industrial plant.Accordingly, we have identified a requirement for
improvements in relation to the analysis of liquid solutions, 
particularly in relation to liquids such as beer, wine etc,
offering improvements in relation to matters discussed above,
or generally.There is disclosed in FR-A-670,046 a method and apparatus
for analysing a mixture of gases of vapours as defined in the
pre-characterising portion of claim 1 hereof.According to the invention there is provided a method and
apparatus for analysis of liquid solutions as defined in the
accompanying claims.In a preferred embodiment, the method and apparatus
comprises the step of vaporising the beer and measuring the
alcohol content by the use of infra-red analysis apparatus
operating in the vapour phase. As a
