<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a column
for liquid
chromatography to be used for separating and purifying
materials, particularly physiologically active
materials such as protein and peptide, and to a method
for using such a column.Heretofore, the physiologically active materials
such as protein and peptide have been ordinarily
separated and purified by low-pressure chromatography.
According to this method, a soft gel is charged
into a cylindrical glass column, and an intended material
is separated and purified by spontaneously flowing a raw
material liquid through the soft gel. However, since
this method called an open system requires a long time
for the separation and purification in a practical scale,
investigation has been recently being effected to make
the separation and purification by using a high speed
liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a shorter time. According to recently developed and employed
high speed liquid chromatography, a raw material liquid
is passed through a granular filler charged into a
slender stainless column having high pressure proof for
separating and purifying an intended material. However,
the separation and purification with such a stainless
column has the following problems. That is, (1) since
even the stainless steel column may be corroded, the raw
material liquid may be contaminated. (2) Since the
stainless column is opaque, whether a bubble is present
in the filler or not or whether the raw material liquid
flows through the filler in an normal state or not
cannot be visually observed. Consequently, fluctuation
or deterioration of measurement results cannot be
preliminarily prevented from the outside. Further, even
if the measurement result becomes relatively broad, it
is difficult to correctly grasp a reason therefor. (3)
Further, since the conventional high speed liquid
chromatography is long and the grain size of the
granular filler charged into the column is small, the
pressure loss is large when the liquid is passed through
the filler in the column device. Accordingly, in order
to effect the separation and purification at a high
speed, the raw material liquid must be fed into the
column under high pressure. Therefore, it is necessary
that sufficient pressure proof is afforded upon the 
stainless column, and a high pressure pump is used.
This makes the equipment very expensive. (4) When the
column equipment is scaled up for effecting the
separation and purification in a large amount, the
weight of the column becomes greater. Thus, this makes
it difficult to adopt

A column for liquid chromatography, comprising a
tubular body (1) made of resin having a first open end

(3) and a second end having a fluid outflow opening (4),
a head member (2) made of resin detachably fitted in said

first end (3) of the tubular body and having a fluid
inflow opening (A) through it, said tubular body and said

head member defining a column chamber, and a pair of
filters (8, 8') in said tubular body for enclosing, in

use, a granular filler, 
characterised by
