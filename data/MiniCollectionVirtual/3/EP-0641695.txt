<ABSTRACT>
An optoelectronic sensor device is proposed which consists mainly of a ray transmitting/ray receiving arrangement (6, 7) which is assigned to a ray guiding element and is arranged in a common housing together with a heating device. For the purpose of installing the heating device in the vicinity of the sensor device in a particularly simple way, the heating device consists of at least one heat conducting metal sheet (8) which is attached to a carrier component (5) and is assigned with its essential main surfaces (24) to the ray guiding element and is connected to the electrical printed circuit board by at least one connecting arm. In addition, the heating device consists of at least one heating element (25) which is arranged in the vicinity of a connecting arm directly on the electrical printed circuit board and, in order to conduct the necessary heat into the heat conducting metal sheet (8) is connected to an associated connecting arm using a connecting material.
