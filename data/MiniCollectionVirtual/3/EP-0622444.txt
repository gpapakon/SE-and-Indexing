<ABSTRACT>
A lubricating oil composition for wet clutches or wet brakes, which comprises a base oil and an inorganic phosphorus compound 
which may contain sulfur and/or oxygen atom(s) as the constituent element(s) or an amine salt of said compound, or 

which comprises a base oil, said inorganic phosphorus compound or amine salt thereof, and further an organic polyol compound 
having at least two hydroxyl groups in its molecule. This composition realizes excellent friction characteristics in wet clutches and 

brakes, in particular, a high µd (coefficient of kinetic friction) and a high µs (coefficient of static friction), a satisfactory suppression 
of vibration in lock-up clutches, an excellent persistence of the effect of vibration suppression, and the temperature-independency 

of the coefficients of friction. Hence this composition is useful as shock absorber oil, power steering oil, hydraulic suspension 
oil and so forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an inorganic phosphorus compound to improve the frictional properties
of a wet-clutch or wet-brake lubricant composition.A wet clutch or a wet brake of a power transmission device such as an automatic transmission for an automobile,
an agricultural machine, a construction machine, or other industrial machines transmits a driving force by
regulating the frictional properties of a plate on the driving side and a plate on the driven side, wherein the frictional
properties of a lubricant employed for lubrication have a very important bearing. A wet clutch is taken up for explanation
as a representative in the following description. Since inappropriate frictional properties cause a power transmission
loss in the clutch and greatly affect the comfort on operating the machine, it is important for the lubricant to have
appropriate frictional properties.The friction control of a wet clutch of this type involves three friction coefficients, i.e. dynamic friction coefficient,
break-away friction coefficient, and static friction coefficient, and it is conventionally required for the regulation of the
friction in a wet clutch of this type to raise the power transmission torque (called as dynamic friction coefficient in view
of the friction coefficient and usually expressed as µd; hereinafter referred to as µd), and at the same time, to lower
the friction transmission torque at the engaging point of the wet clutch (called as break-away friction coefficient in view
of the friction coefficient and usually expressed as µ0; hereinafter referred to as µ0). If the ratio of µ0/µd exceeds 1, a
transmission shock is produced to arouse discomfort at the change of speed (when the clutch is operated). If the ratio
is 1 or less, no such a transmission shock is produced and the transmission properties which do not impair the comfort
are obtained.The power transmitting capacity of the wet clutch is also of importance, and in this connection, it is
importantto increase the static friction torque (called as static friction coefficient and expressed as µs to be distinguished
from the break-away friction coefficient; hereinafter referred to as µs).Since these friction coefficients depend largely upon the lubricant employed, for improving the transmission
shock, the use of a friction modifier, etc. has usually been practiced to reduce the ratio of µ0/µd to 1 or less, however,
the addition of the friction modifier, etc. causes at the same time a problem of lowering in µs. It is, therefore,
