<ABSTRACT>
A technique for coding color components of video signals is described. 
In accordance with an embodiment, a color component (U.V) of an image signal 

sequence is filtered (in 12,22) into a plurality of subband image signals. One or 
more pixels of a first subband image signal are coded (Q16-1; Q26-1) using one or 

more bits of a first quantity of bits. The first subband image signal reflects an image 
structure of a color component of the image signal sequence. The first subband 

includes low spatial and temporal frequencies of the color component. A second 
quantity of bits is used for coding one or more pixels of a second subband image 

signal. This second quantity of bits comprises one or more bits of the first quantity 
not used in coding pixels of the first subband image signal. One or more pixels of 

the second subband image signal are coded (Q16-8.1; Q26-8.1) using one or more of 
the second quantity of bits. The second subband image signal reflects image object 

motion information of the color component of the image signal sequence. A third 
quantity of bits is provided for use in coding one or more pixels of a third subband 

image signal. The third quantity of bits comprises one or more bits not used in 
coding either the first or second subband image signals. One or more pixels of the 

third subband image signal are coded (Q16-2,Q16-3; Q26-2,Q26-3) with one or more 
of the third quantity of bits. The third subband image signal reflects edges of moving 

image objects, such as horizontal or vertical edges. A corresponding method of 
synthesizing color images is also describ
ed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of coding a color component of an
image signal sequence.Good quality, low bit rate color video coding is required for such
applications as video teleconferencing over existing and future networks, as well as CD-ROM
storage. An effective low rate coder should remove the redundancies due to
temporal and spatial correlations along with perceptually irrelevant components of an
image sequence.Subband digital coding techniques are well known in the art. See, e.g.,
N.S. Jayant and P. Noll, Digital Coding of Waveforms: Principles and Applications to
Speech and Video (1984).Subband coding techniques have been used for image coding in a three-dimensional
spatio-temporal subband framework as described in G. Karlsson and M.
Vetterli, Three Dimensional Subband Coding of Video, Proceedings ICASSP (1988),
1100-1103. The technique described there employs multidimensional filtering to
generate spatio-temporal frequency bands or subbands using so called quadrature mirror
filters. These latter filters are described, e.g., in J.D. Johnston, A Filter Family
Designed for Use in Quadrature Mirror Filter Bands, Proceedings ICASSP (1980).An MIMD architecture developed for the realtime implementation of
three-dimensional subband coders is described in J. Hartung, Architecture for the Real-Time
Implementation of Three-Dimensional Subband Video Coding, Proceedings
ICASSP (1992), 225-228. A subband coding algorithm consists of filtering the original
sequence into critically sampled subbands which are quantized and transmitted to a
decoder. The decomposition into subbands is accomplished by temporal, horizontal,
and vertical filtering into only high and low bands, respectively. A decoder dequantizes
and filters the received data through related filters to reconstruct the image sequence.The allocation of channel bandwidth among multiple video coders that
are processing in parallel various areas of a single image is described in EP-A-0479432A3.
A video splitter is used to split successive images of a video signal using
spatial decomposition or, alternatively, using a subband frequency decomposition. A
video coder is used to reconstruct the images. US-A-4,817,182 discloses the analysis of image data in a number of
iterated analysis procedures, using two-dimensional quadrature mirror filters to separate
low-pass spatial filter response components and three differently oriented high-pass
spatial filter response components.EP-A-0450937A3 discloses a geometric vector quantizer coding
technique based on a
