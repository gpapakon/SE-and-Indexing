Title: BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE TROPANE DERIVATIVESGRANT REFERENCEThis invention was made with government support under R01-DA-06301-02 awarded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse. The government has certain rights in the invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCocaine has the following formula:COCAINE -250 nMThe basic ring structure of cocaine is a tropane ring system. Thus, in preparing cocaine analogs, this tropane ring system must be preserved.The illicit use of cocaine represents one of the most significant problems of drug abuse in modern society. In the United States, researchers estimate that at least 20 million people have used this drug at some point in their lifetimes. One of the biggest problems with cocaine use is its high addictive liability. Cocaine is a potent activator of brain reward systems, and people who take the drug are generally highly motivated to maintain the same effect.The mechanism of cocaine action involves its ability to block dopamine uptake into neurons by inhibiting the neuronal dopamine transporter. This uptake process is one of the most important ways in 

 which dopamine actions are normally terminated in the central nervous system. Thus, administration of cocaine acts to increase dopamine levels, especially in those areas of the brain which activate reward (or pleasure) centers. By measuring the affinity of cocaine analogs in binding to brain dopamine transporters in brain membranes, researchers have been able to predict the relative potencies of these analogs in producing cocaine-like behavioral actions, see Ritz, M.C. and Kuhar, M.J.: J. Pharmacol, Exp. Ther. 248, 1010-1017 (1989). Another important pharmacological characteristic of cocaine is its rapid kinetic properties. Cocaine has an extremely rapid onset of action, and its CNS effects are quickly finished. There is no question that these rapid kinetics contribute to the high incidence of repetitive use of cocaine (e.g., "binges") which are common among addicts.Despite the advances in understanding cocaine actions, there is as yet no pharmacological strategy that has been effective in treating cocaine addicts. Historically, in the field of drug abuse, there have been three general strategies employed to decrease drug self-administration. It is important to consider how the synthesis of novel cocaine analogs would fit in with these general approaches.The first approach is replacement drugs. In this strategy, an analog which produces the same effect as the abused drug is given to the addict as a safer alternative. A
