<ABSTRACT>
The present invention permits solder joints to be made 
directly to via and through holes without the solder being 

wicked into the vias or through holes, by filling plated 
through holes (14) with an epoxy or cyanate fill composition (16). When 

cured and overplated, the fill composition (16) provides support 
for the solder joint (22) and provides a flat solderable surface (18) 

for the inter-connection. In certain embodiments, the cured 
fill compositions, offer a further advantage of being 

conductive. The invention also relates to several novel 
methods for filling through holes with such fill compositions, 

and to resistors located in through holes and vias.

<DESCRIPTION>
In circuit board construction, solder ball connection of a
module, such as a ceramic module, provides significant
electrical performance advantage over conventional pin-in-hole
technology. Pin-in-hole technology involves the attachment of
modules to circuit boards using projections or pins which
insert into corresponding holes in the board. Pin-in-hole
connections, due to mechanical considerations, occupy
considerable surface area of the circuit board thwarting
further miniaturization. In contrast, solder ball technology
attaches modules to the board using balls of solder on the
module which are joined to corresponding contact points on the
surface of the board.Specifically, a high melting point solder ball is placed on
the backside of a module and attached to the module with a
low melting point solder paste reflow process. The module is
then attached to the surface of the circuit board with a
screened, low melting point solder paste. Since attachment of
the module to the board is made only on the surface of the
board, the attachment land, drill diameter, and clearance land
sizes may be reduced in size, thus allowing greater wiring
area. Solder ball connection provides the advantage of
enhanced system speed because the signal net length is reduced
and also provides the advantage of enhanced wiring capability
due to reduced via and land diameters.However, a problem with solder ball connect technology occurs
where the solder ball connection is being made to a
conventional through hole or via. When such a connection has
been attempted, the screened eutectic paste used to connect 
the solder ball to the board flows through the hole away from
the intended inter-connection site during the reflowing
process. This results in poor and unreliable solder joints.
One attempt to attach a module directly to a via in pad type
of land was to pre-fill the through holes with solder to
create a solid land prior to attachment of the solder ball.
However, the solder is pulled down through the hole, away from
the inter-connection during the assembly of the circuit board.
This pulling down or "wicking" of the solder results in a void
below the ball which leads to cracking and thus produces poor,
unreliable solder joints.Another solution to the problem of connecting solder balls to
through holes has been to utilize a "dog-bone" type
termination where a solid copper land is displaced from the
plated through hole or via. The solder joint is made to the
solid copper land which is then connected by a circuit line to
the via or
