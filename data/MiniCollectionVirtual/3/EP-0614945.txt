<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic blend compositions are Provided 
containing a Polybutylene terephthalate resin, a 

rubber modified graft copolymer, and a rigid 
vinyl aromatic vinyl cyanide copolymer wherein 

the melt viscosity of the polybutylene 
terephthalate resin is lower than a blend 

consisting of the rigid copolymer and rubber 
modified graft copolymer to improve the surface 

appearance of the composition upon injection 
molding thereof. The compositions are useful for 

making molded articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
polyester/rubber modified graft copolymer blends, 
and more particularly, relates to polybutylene 
terephthalate/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 
graft copolymer blends exhibiting improved 
surface appearance. Blends of high molecular weight polybutylene 
terephthalate resin (PBT), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 
graft copolymers (ABS), and 
non-grafted styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers 
(SAN) are known. When such blends are injection 
molded they often exhibit chattering surface 
blemishes. Injection molding of these 
PBT/SAN/ABS blends quite often result in 
chattering surface blemishes, especially at lower 
stock temperatures (460°F) and higher injection 
speeds (> 2''/sec.). Consequently, there is a desire to provide 
polybutylene terephthalate resin/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 
graft copolymer/non-grafted 
styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer blends that 
exhibit improved surface appearances following 
injection molding thereof.  The present invention involves thermoplastic 
compositions comprising polybutylene 
terephthalate resin, a rubber modified graft 
copolymer, and a non-grafted, rubber free, rigid 
vinyl aromatic/vinyl cyanide copolymer, wherein 
the Mobay melt viscosity at shear rate of the 
polybutylene terephthalate is sufficiently lower 
than that of a blend of the rigid copolymer and 
rubber modified graft copolymer to improve the 
surface appearance of the composition upon 
injection molding thereof. The compositions are 
useful for making molded articles. Thermoplastic polyesters such as polyalkylene 
terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate 
polymers are well known in the art. Polybutylene 
terephthalate polymers in general are disclosed, 
for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,066,627; 
4,184,033; 4,069,278 and 4,593,077, all of which 
are incorporated herein by reference. The polybutylene terephthalates contain at 
least 90 mole percent, based on the dicarboxylic 
acid component, of terephthalic acid residues and 
at least 90 mole percent, based on the diol 
component of 1.4 butane diol residues. In addition to terephthalic acid residues, 
the polybutylene terephthalates may contain up to 
10 mole percent of residues of other aromatic, 
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids, 
for example succinic acid, adipic acid or 
isophthalic acid residues. In addition to butane 
diol residues, they may contain up to 10 mole 
percent of residues of another diol which may 
correspond to the following formula:  HO-CnH2n-OHin which n is an integer of
