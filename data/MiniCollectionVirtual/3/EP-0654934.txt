<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus stores an ID number input 
through an auditor in a memory section when a paper money 

judging section judges that image data obtained from an 
image reading section is the image data of paper money. 

With this structure, the fact that an attempt to perform 
counterfeiting was made is known by reading out the ID 

number stored in the memory section. In this case, since 
it is proved that a counterfeiter knew a specific ID 

number, the counterfeiter would be detected from a limited 
number of people. It is thus possible to take some 

measures to prevent recurrence of counterfeiting by, for 
example, enhancing the inspection of the image forming 

apparatus and giving a warning to the counterfeiter. 
Image data and operator identification information may be transmitted 
by telecommunication means. In another embodiment the operator is 

identified by fingerprint comparing means. Fingerprint reading means 
therefor may be installed in a switch to be depressed by the operator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an and image forming
apparatus, such as a color copying machine and a color
scanner, for reading images on, for example, a document and
outputting the images, and to an image forming method.In recent years, image forming apparatuses such as
full-color copying machines are developed and widely used.
Since these image forming apparatuses produce highly precise
reproductions of original images, they may be used for the
crime of counterfeiting paper money and securities, for
example. In order to prevent such a crime, the following
apparatuses have been developed. 
These apparatuses, for instance, stop copying operations
when a copying-prohibited document such as paper money is
detected, and prints a particular mark, which has been
given to a copying machine, on a copy of the document
image so that the copying machine used for producing the
copy is identified from the mark on the copy.For example, apparatuses performing the former
function are disclosed in the following documents.
Japanese Patent Publications
JP 20 83571 A and JP 1 285978 A teach apparatuses which
store patterns of copying-prohibited documents such as
paper money and become inoperable when a document to be
copied has one of the patterns stored. Japanese
Publication for Unexamined Patent Application No.
205272/1992 and No. 316783/1989 disclose apparatuses
which, if a document to be copied is detected as paper
money, prints the whole portion corresponding to paper
money in deep black or halftone when outputting a copy of
the document. The apparatuses perform the latter function
are disclosed in the following documents. Japanese
Patent Publications
JP 4 294682 A and JP 4 302267 A teach apparatuses which
print a pattern unique to a copying machine in
unnoticeable color or a unique feature of the copying
machine, for example, the product number when outputting a 
copy of the document image.However, although the above-mentioned conventional
structures can prevent a crime, it is impossible to
effectively identify the person who committed the socially
punishable crime, such as counterfeiting paper money.
Hence, the conventional apparatuses cannot perfectly
prevent never stopping counterfeiting of paper money.Prior art document EP 0 506 469 A2 discloses an image
processing apparatus and copying machine which includes a
memory circuit, an image scanner for reading a color image,
an image output device, an operating circuit, and a
decision circuit for discriminating a specific original.
The decision circuit is provided
