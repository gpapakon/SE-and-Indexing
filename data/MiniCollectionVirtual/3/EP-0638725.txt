<ABSTRACT>
In an axial-flow compressor, the device for bleeding off secondary air, employing a revolving offtake slot which is designed, at least in part, as a diagonal diffuser, is characterised in that means are arranged, in or directly at the offtake slot (4), which utilise the kinetic energy of the circumferential component of the flow velocity. This may be, e.g., a small set of guide baffles (7) which is integrated into the offtake slot (4) or an offtake slot (4) which is designed as a diagonal diffuser (8) and merges into a spiral volute (9), the spiral (9) debouching directly into the offtake pipe (6). These arrangements minimise the total pressure head loss and increase the efficiency of the installation.
