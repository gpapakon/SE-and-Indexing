<ABSTRACT>
The specification relates to an adsorptive material 
for removing malodorous substances from gases and liquids. The 

adsorptive material comprises a substrate having macromonomers 
which are bonded to the substrate and contain functional 

groups capable of adsorbing polar substances. The adsorptive 
material is produced by applying to the substrate a mixture 

of a monosaccharide and the macromonomers and then grafting 
the macromonomers to the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to adsorptive materials for
removing malodorous substances from gases and liquids, as
well as a process for producing such adsorptive materials.
More particularly, this invention relates to adsorptive
materials for removing malodorous substances in such items
as clothes, bedclothes, pillow covers as well as animal
laboratories, residences, hospitals and automobiles and
to a process for producing such adsorptive materials.With recent improvements in living standards, not
only the malodor from industrial plants but also malodor
originating from various sources in everyday life such
as toilets, garbage, sewage and pet animals have become
a social concern. The causative substances of malodor
include, for example, ammonia, amines, hydrogen sulfide
and mercaptans. Various methods are available for removing
malodors originating from everyday life and they include,
for example: spraying or evaporating fragrance substances;
cleaning with chemicals such as acids or alkalies; adsorbing
malodorous substances on zeolite or bentonite; using
catalysts or oxidizers; and neutralizing malodorous
substances with ion exchangers.JP-A-2-69123
teaches a chemical for clearing excretions from
pet animals. The chemical comprises a water-absorbing
polymeric powder that is incorporated in a powder comprising
a nonmetallic mineral having ion-exchange capability and
adsorptive power.JP-B-3-8738
teaches a dry particulate material for treating excretions
from domesticated animals and contains chemical pulp,
mechanical pulp or semichemical pulp and an inorganic
filler. US-A-4,076,619
teaches a crosslinked acrylic polymer capable of selective
adsorption of waste matter as excreted by fish and shellfish
in seawater.However, these conventional methods have been unable
to yield completely satisfactory results since their ability
to remove malodorous substances is either insufficient or
limited to particular substances.The present invention has been accomplished under
these circumstances and has as an object of providing an
adsorptive material that is capable of adsorbing a wide
spectrum of malodorous substances with improved efficiency.This object of the present invention can be attained by an 
adsorptive material comprising a substrate and a polymerized material
derived from monomers having functional groups capable of adsorbing
polar substances,
said polymerized material having a degree of polymerization of from 10
to 100 and containing
(a) units derived from at least one monomer selected from hydroxyethyl
methacryl
