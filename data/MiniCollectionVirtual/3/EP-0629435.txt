<ABSTRACT>
A mixing apparatus for mixing and stirring of liquid or 
paste-like masses in a cylindric cooking vessel (12), for 

example for preparation of food in large kitchens. The 
apparatus comprises at least one vertical drive-shaft (18, 

19) which is connected to drive means. The drive-shaft is 
located primarily coaxial with or in line with the 

longitudinal axis of the vessel and it is provided with 
attachments (15, 16) for at least three agitator wings (17). 

The agitator wings (17) are radially displaceable connected 
to each respective attachment (15, 16), in such a manner 

that radially outer ends of the agitator wings (17) during 
rotation are elastically supported via support surfaces 

against the inner surface of the cooking vessel (10). The 
support force contributing to the centring of the 

drive-shaft (18, 19) in relation to the inner surface of the 
vessel (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a mixing apparatus for 
mixing and stirring liquid or paste-like masses in a 
cylindric cooking vessel, comprising at least one vertical 
drive-shaft which is connected to drive means, said drive-shaft 
being located primarily coaxial with or in line with 
the longitudinal axis of the vessel, and which is provided 
with attachments for at least three agitator wings, said 
wings being radially displaceable connected to each 
respective attachment, so that the 
radially outer ends of the agitator 
wings during rotation 
elastically press against the inner surface of the vessel. Cooking vessels with mixing apparatus according to above are 
used in large kitchens and are for example known from 
SE-A-425210 which discloses a drive unit that can be raised 
and lowered. Often, the drive unit is arranged so that it 
can move or swing over from one pot to another. Because the 
development has gone in the direction towards mixing 
apparatuses with scrapers of plastic- or rubber material 
which keeps the sides and the bottom of the vessels clean, 
the increased friction has created more stresses upon the 
drive unit and its stand. The drive unit and its stand can 
of course be made stronger, to compensate for the increased 
loads. This is however comparatively expensive, due to the 
ability of the drive unit to be raised and lowered. SE-A-455264 describes a cooking vessel with a dismountable 
horizontal stay that holds the mixing apparatus, even if the 
drive unit is disconnected. A drawback with this arrangement 
is, that the cleaning of the pot is more complicated. The  
 
purpose with the use of scrapes or brushes is consequently 
partly counteracted by this known device. US-A-3381941 discloses a stirring apparatus having radially 
displaceable stirrer blades. The blades are connected to the 
shaft via links. Cleaning of this stirring apparatus is 
difficult, because a large number of screws, bolts or pins 
must be dismantled in the process. DE-A-3531841 discloses a mixing apparatus having radially 
displaceable blades. This apparatus is not suitable for 
cooking vessels, because the blades are journalled in radial 
slots which are difficult to clean. US-A-2178269 discloses a batter mixer having radially 
displaceable blades. This apparatus is very expensive to 
manufacture and also very difficult to clean. The object of the present invention is to provide a mixing 
apparatus for cooking vessels, which makes it possible to 
keep the vessels clean in an efficient way while at the
