<ABSTRACT>
All of the air introduced is compressed to a high pressure and then cooled to an intermediate temperature. At this temperature, some of the air is turbined (at 8) at medium pressure, and the rest is liquefied. In order to make it possible to adjust at will the production of oxygen and/or nitrogen in liquid form, an additional cycle fluid withdrawn (at 27) from the double column (11) is heated (at 10), it is compressed (at 3) to a high cycle pressure, it is cooled, a fraction of it is expanded (at 8) with the exertion of external work, and the rest of the compressed additional cycle fluid is liquefied.

Method for producing at least one gaseous product comprising gaseous
oxygen at production pressure between approx. 3 and 100 bar and/or

gaseous nitrogen at production pressure between approx. 7 and 100
bar and a variable yield of at least one of these products in liquid form

of the type in which:

air is distilled in a double distillation column (11) comprising a low
pressure column (13) which functions at a pressure termed low

pressure and a medium pressure column (12) which functions at a
pressure termed medium pressure;
the total quantity of air to be distilled is compressed (in 1, 3, 7) to at
least a high air pressure which is clearly greater than the medium

pressure;
the compressed air is cooled to an intermediate temperature and a part
of it is expanded in a turbine (8) to medium pressure before it is

introduced into a medium pressure column (12);
the air which has not been in the turbine is liquified, then introduced
into the double column after being expanded (in 20, 21);
at least one of said products in a liquid form is brought, having been
drawn off from the double column, to said production pressure, and

this liquid product is vapourised by heat exchange with at least a
part of the air to be distilled during cooling to a temperature which

is equal to or broadly higher than that corresponding to the
condensation of the air; and
oxygen and/or nitrogen is drawn off from the installation in liquid
form,

characterised in that a variable yield of an additional cycle fluid which
is drawn off from the double column (11) or intended for the latter is 

heated, said output is compressed (in 3; 30, 31) to a high pressure
cycle, cooled, a fraction thereof is expanded (in 8; 35) with production

of outside work, the expanded fraction is reintroduced into the
additional cycle fluid, this expanded fraction is heated with the

additional cycle fluid, the remainder of the compressed additional cycle
fluid is liquified, and this liquified fluid is supplied to the double

column.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the additional cycle
fluid is air at the medium pressure which, after its heating, is mixed

with the air to be distilled which has been pre-compressed to this
medium pressure (in 1), the mixture thereafter being compressed to

the said high pressure (in 3).
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the pre-compressed
air to be distilled (in 1) is mixed with the recyoled air before being

purified, and the mixture is compressed to said high pressure then
purified in water and in carbon dioxide at this high pressure (in 6)

(Figure 1).
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the pre-compressed
air to be distilled (in 1) is purified in water and carbon dioxide (in 6)

before being mixed with the recycled air (Figure 2).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the additional cycle
fluid is nitrogen which is drawn off from the top of at least one of the

two columns (12, 13), the expanded fraction of this nitrogen being
heated while its liquified fraction is reintroduced into the double

column or recovered as product.
Installation for producing gaseous oxygen and/or gaseous nitrogen

comprising a low pressure column (13) which functions at a pressure

termed low pressure, and a medium pressure column (12) which 
functions at a pressure termed medium pressure; compression means

(1, 3, 7) for bringing the total quantity of air to be distilled to at least a
high pressure which is clearly higher than the madium pressure;

means (15) for drawing off from the double column and for pumping at
least one liquid product resulting from the distillation; a thermal

exchange line (10) which places said liquid product and at least a part
of the air to be distilled in a thermal exchange relation during cooling;

a main turbine (8) for expanding a part of this air, the inlet of this
turbine being connected at an intermediate point in the thermal

exchange line and its exhaust being connected to the medium pressure
column (12); and means for drawing off oxygen and/or nitrogen from

the installation in a liquid form, characterised in that said installation
comprises a cycle compressor (3, 7; 30, 31, 34), and in that the

thermal exchange line (10) comprises passages for heating a variable
yield of additional cycle fluid which is drawn off from the double

column (11) or intended for the latter, these passages being connected
to the suction of the cycle compressor, and passages for cooling the
