<ABSTRACT>
A panel mount connector (2) comprises a panel mount 
component (4) and a movable component (8). The panel mount 

connector (4) can be mounted to a panel (4) by a combined 
sealing and provisional mounting ring (10). The movable 

connector part (8) comprises a terminal receiving housing 
(16) and a bayonet type rotatable locking ring (18) having 

a first axial position allowing mounting of a rubber boot 
(20) to the housing (16), the locking ring (18) 

retractable to a second position partially extending over 
the rubber boot (20) in order to prevent it from being 

accidentally pulled off the housing (16). The connectors 
(8 and 4) can then be mated together by aligning keying 

means of the housing (16) with corresponding keying means 
of the panel connector housing (12), axially moving the 

housings together, and then rotating the bayonet type 
locking ring (18) until an end position whereby the 

sealing ring is compressed between a flange (114) of the 
locking ring and the panel (6) for sealing therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a panel mount connector assembly
according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1.It is common to find circular electrical connectors
for use in the automobile industry whereby the connector
is mounted to a panel of the body work and electrically
connects cables, for example in the engine compartment to
cables in the passenger compartment. In order to prevent
dust and liquid ingress into the electrical connector and
into the passenger compartment, the circular bulkhead
connectors commonly comprise sealing means such as a
flexible rubber boot that is mounted around the connector
and cables on the engine compartment side. Examples of
such bulkhead connectors are shown in
DE-A-4306806 and Great Britain patent
application 9204894.1. In order to facilitate assembly,
one of the connector parts is usually mountable to the
bulkhead and the other connector part can be mated
therewith at an ulterior stage in the assembly procedure.
One of the preferred connection mechanisms for coupling
circular connectors is a bayonet type of mechanism,
whereby one connector part is rotated relative to the
other as the mating terminals are pushed together. For
assembly reasons, the panel mounted connector part is
usually the part found on the passenger compartment side,
which doesn't require any sealing means. The other
connector part comprising the rubber boot and sealing
means is then connected thereto.One of the problems associated with the above, is
that during assembly of the mating connector parts, the
rubber boot is often pulled off as it has to be held
during rotation of the connector. As the latter happens on
the assembly line of the automobile, it is time consuming 
and therefore costly to refit the rubber boot in its
correct position. Further disadvantages of the above
connectors is that the male terminals belonging to the
engine compartment connector part protrude from a mating
face thereof, unprotected and thus prone to damage. Yet
another disadvantage of the above connectors, is that the
passenger compartment connector part is mounted to a panel
with resilient latches, whereby the connector part is time
consuming and sometimes very difficult to remove from
panel, and the latches prone to damage by the sharp edges
of the panel hole.It would therefore be desirable to produce a circular
bulkhead connector that has securely mounted sealing
means, provides protection for the terminals and is easily
mountable and dismountable from a panel. As the terminals
passing through a panel of an

<CLAIMS>
A panel mount connector assembly (2) comprising a first connector
part (4) mountable to a panel (6), a second connector part (8)

matable to the first part (4) for connection therebetween, a sealing
ring (10) rotatably mountable to the first connector part (4) from

one side of the panel (6) when the first connector part is inserted
through a hole (124) in the panel from the other side thereof,

whereby the sealing ring (10) provisionally holds the first connector
part (4) to the panel (6) prior to mating with the second connector

part (8), and whereby the sealing ring acts as a seal between the
one side and the other side of the panel when the first (4) and

second (8) connector parts are mated together, characterized in that
the sealing ring (10) has two lateral sets of tabs (106, 108)

extending radially inwards, the tabs engageable in bayonet-type slots
(36) of the first connector part (4), one set (106) proximate one side

of the sealing ring (10) and the other set (108) proximate the other
side thereof, whereby the sealing ring (10) is mountable to the

connector part (4) from either side of the sealing ring (10).
The assembly of claim 1, wherein said slots (36) have windows (38)
for receiving one set of tabs (106) and the ring (10) is rotatable

until the tabs (108) of the other second set (108) are adjacent the
windows (38) and axially movable towards the panel (6) such that

the second set of tabs (108) engage in the windows (38) for
preventing rotation of the sealing ring (10) relative to the first

connector part (4).
The assembly of claim 1, characterized in that the first connector
part (4) comprises an end cap (14) receivable over a terminal

receiving end (44) thereof, the cap (14) having terminal receiving
holes (56) aligned and corresponding to terminal receiving cavities

(22) of the connector housing (12), the end cap being movable
relative to the housing from a first position to a second position and 

visa-versa, whereby in the first position terminals are insertable into
the housing cavities (22), and in the second position the inserted

terminals are locked within the housing (12).
The assembly of claim 3, characterized in that the first connector
housing (4) comprises a panel mounting flange (30) having means

(31) for polarizing the connector (4) with respect to the panel (6),
and the end cap (14) comprises means (66) proximate the polarizing

means (31) such that in the first position the first connector part (4)
cannot be mounted to the panel (6).
The assembly of claim 4, characterized in that the polarizing means
(31) comprises a cut-out in the flange (30) for receiving a bent tab

(126) of the panel (6).
The assembly of any preceding claim characterized in that the
second connector part (8) comprises a housing (16) for receiving

terminals and a rotatable locking ring (18) for securing the second
(8) to the first (4) connector part, the housing (16) comprising

rubber boot fixing means (86) around the periphery of the housing
proximate a terminal receiving end (88) thereof, and the locking

ring (18) comprising a shroud (124) whereby the locking ring (18)
is slidable from a first position away from the rubber boot fixing

means (86) to a second position proximate the means (86) such that
the shroud (124) extends at least partially thereover for preventing

removal of a rubber boot (20) therefrom.
The assembly of any preceding claim characterized in that keying

means (100) extend from a mating face (90) of the second connector
part (8) such that it cannot be assembled to the first connector part

(4) unless the locking ring (18) is retracted to the second position
allowing it to rotate relative to the housing (16).
