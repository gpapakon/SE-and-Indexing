<ABSTRACT>
A signal processor (e.g., 11) with an embedded Viterbi co-processor 
(e.g., 13) is disclosed. The Viterbi branch metric unit (e.g., 15) contains embedded 

metric units (e.g., 25, 27, 29) which calculate either Euclidean or Manhattan metrics 
for MLSE or deconvolution operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the following concurrently filed patents: US-A-5465275 entitled "Efficient Utilization of Present State/Next State Registers";
US-A-5490178 entitled "Power and Time Saving Initial Tracebacks"; US-A-5513220
entitled "Digital Receiver with Minimum Cost Index Register"; and US-A-5432804
entitled "Digital Processor and Viterbi Decoder Having Shared Memory".This invention relates to integrated circuits.Mobile communication devices, such as mobile digital cellular
telephones, often employ digital signal processors for processing and filtering received
and transmitted digital signals. Often, a separate chip is provided to implement a
Viterbi process for correcting errors or decoding incoming signals.The Viterbi process is a maximum likelihood decoding process that
provides forward error correction. The Viterbi process is used in decoding a bit stream
sequence of encoded signals or signals which have been corrupted by intersymbol
interference or noise. The bit stream may represent encoded 
information in a telecommunication system transmission through various media with
each set of bits representing a symbol instance. In the decoding process, the Viterbi 
algorithm works back to a sequence of possible bit sequences at each symbol instant
to determine which one bit sequence is most likely to have been transmitted. The
possible transitions from a bit state at one symbol instant to a bit at a next,
subsequent symbol instant is limited. Each possible transition from one state to a
next state may be shown graphically as a trellis and is defined as a branch. A
sequence of interconnected branches is defined as a path. Each state can only
transition to a limited number of the next states upon receipt of the next bit in the bit
stream. Thus, some paths survive and others do not survive during the decoding
process. By eliminating those transitions that are not permissible, computational
efficiency can be achieved in determining the most likely paths to survive. The
Viterbi process typically defines and calculates a branch metric associated with each
branch and employs this branch metric to determine which paths survive and which
paths do not survive.Typically, the Viterbi process is implemented on a chip which is
separate from the digital processing chip. The Viterbi process is usually
implemented in software which is executed by this separate chip. Incoming signals
are first routed to the Viterbi processor for decoding. The decoded signals are then
routed to the digital signal processor
