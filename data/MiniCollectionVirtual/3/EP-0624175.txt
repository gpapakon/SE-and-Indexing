<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressure sensitive 
membrane and a method therefor, the membrane comprising 
a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fibril matrix having 
both conductive particles and energy expanded particles 
enmeshed therein. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-containing 
articles are known to provide thermal insulation. 
Related U.S. Patent Nos. 3,953,566, 3,962,153, 
4,096,227, and 4,187,390 teach a porous product 
comprising expanded, amorphous locked PTFE which can be 
laminated and impregnated to provide shaped articles. 
The more highly expanded materials of that invention 
are disclosed to be useful, for example, as thermal 
insulators and shaped articles. PTFE fibrillated matrices are known. The 
background art teaches several formulations for 
blending an aqueous PTFE dispersion with various 
additives and/or adjuvants designed for specific 
purposes. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,990,544 
teaches a gasket comprising a fibrillated PTFE resin 
and dispersed therein a fine inorganic powder. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,985,296 teaches an expanded, porous PTFE 
film containing filler material which is purposely 
compressed to provide thin films where space reduction 
is desirable. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,971,736, 4,906,378, and 
4,810,381 disclose a chromatographic sheetlike article 
and method of preparing a composite chromatographic 
sheetlike article comprising a PTFE fibril matrix and 
5 nonswellable sorptive hydrophobic particles enmeshed in 
the matrix. References cited in these patents relate 
to other PTFE matrices containing particulates,  
 
including U.S. Patent Nos. 4,153,661, 4,373,519, 
4,460,642, and 4,565,663. It is known that metals can be incorporated in 
fibrillated PTFE, as in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 
4,153,661. U.S. Patent No. 4,923,737 discloses a 
method for a "metal cloth" prepared from fibrillated 
PTFE containing metal or other particles entrapped in 
the fibrils. A composition comprising fibrillated PTFE in 
combination with a polyamide has been disclosed to 
provide articles by extrusion blowmolding as in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,966,941, and with molybdenum disulfide and 
optionally an elastomer to provide articles with 
increased durability as in U.S. Patent No. 4,962,136. U.S. Patent No. 4,945,125 teaches a process of 
producing a fibrillated semi-interpenetrating polymer 
network of PTFE and silicone elastomer. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,914,156 describes a blow moldable composition 
comprising a polyether, an epoxide polymer, a source of 
catalytic cations, and a fibrillatable

according to claim 1 wherein the weight ratio of 

conductive particles to nonconductive particles is in 
the range of 999:1 to 3:1. 
The composite article according to claims 1 
or 2 wherein said conductive particles are carbon 

particles, metal particles, or particles coated with at 
least one of carbon and metal. 
The composite article according to any of 
claims 1 to 3 wherein said conductive particles have a 

size in the range of 0.1 to 600 micrometers, and said 
expanded particles have a size in the range of 0.12 

micrometer to 1000 micrometers. 
The composite article according to any of 
claims 1 to 4 wherein said nonconductive expanded 

particles have a polymeric shell and a liquid or 
gaseous core.  

 
The composite article according to claim 5 
wherein said nonconductive expanded particles have 

shells comprising copolymers selected from the group 
consisting of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, 

vinyl chloride and acrylonitrile, vinylidene chloride 
and acrylonitrile, styrene and acrylonitrile, methyl  

 
methacrylate and styrene, methyl methacrylate and ethyl 

methacrylate, methacrylonitrile and acrylonitrile, and 
methyl methacrylate and orthochlorostyrene. 
The composite article according to any of 
claims 1 to 6 which is a membrane having a thickness in 

the range of 0.010 cm to 1.5 cm. 
A method comprising the steps of: 

a) providing an electrically nonconductive 
composite article according to any of 

claims 1 to 7, and 
b) applying external pressure to one or 
more portions of said article while said 

article is subject to an electrical 
potential so as to effect a decrease in 

electrical resistance of at least a 
portion of said electrically 

nonconductive article to allow for the 
flow of electrical current, and 
c) optionally, removing said external 
pressure so as to effect an increase in 

electrical resistance and cause the 
electrical current to cease flowing. 
The method according to claim 8 wherein said 
electrically conductive particles are silver coated 

particles.
