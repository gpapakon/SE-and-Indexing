<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adjusting mechanism for variable-pitch propellers of fluid-flow machines. Here, a drivable rotor is arranged on a hollow flange (4) of a shaft (5) connected to the variable-pitch propeller. On its inside diameter, the rotor (10) mounted rotatably on the hollow flange has a shaped portion (11) which interacts with intermediate gears (12) mounted in the hollow flange and drive units.

<CLAIMS>
A setting device for an adjustable propeller attached 
to a shaft of a fluid flow machine, said shaft having a hollow 

flange within which a transmission is arranged, characterized 
in that an annular rotor (10) is rotatably mounted on the hollow 

flange (4), in that the rotor side thereof directed toward 
the axis of rotation possesses a torque transmitting configuration 

(11) and is connected in a force transmitting fashion with 
the transmission (12, 14 and 15) and in that the rotor (10) is 

able to be driven by a motor (7). 
The setting device as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the rotor (10) is designed in the form of the rotor of 

an electric motor (7). 
The setting device as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the rotor side facing away from the axis of rotation 

possesses a configuration ensuring engagement of transmission 
elements (18) and the rotor (10) is able to be driven by the 

intermediary of transmission elements from an electric motor 
(7). 
The setting device as claimed in the claims 1 through 
3, characterized in that one or more intermediate wheels (12) 

are rotatably mounted in recesses (13) in the hollow flange 
(4). 
The setting device as claimed in any one or more of the 
claims 1 through 4, characterized in that the rotor side facing 

the axis of rotation is designed in the form of the annulus of 
epicyclic gearing.
