<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multilayered infrared
reflecting films, and more particularly to polymeric
multilayered films which reflect light in the infrared
region of the spectrum while transmitting light at
substantially all wavelengths in the visible spectrum with
an absence of visibly perceived iridescent color.The reflection and transmission spectra for a
particular film are primarily dependent on the optical
thickness of the individual layers, where optical thickness
is defined as the product of the actual thickness of the
layer times its refractive index. Films can be designed to
reflect infrared, visible, or ultraviolet wavelengths of
light depending on the optical thickness of the layers.
When designed to reflect infrared wavelengths of light,
such prior art films also exhibit higher order reflections
in the visible range, resulting in an iridescent appearance
for the films. The films produced in accordance with the
prior art exhibit iridescence and changing colors as the
angle of incident light on the film is changed.EP-A-0 469 732 discloses an optical interference film
composed of multilayers of at least three polymers (A,B,
and C) which reflect wavelengths of light in the infrared
region of the spectrum while being substantially
transparent to wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The
polymeric materials have a different index of refraction
and the refractive index of the second polymeric material 
is intermediate the respective refractive indices of the
first and third polymeric materials with the layers
preferably repeating as ABCB. There is no teaching of
reflective polymeric film composed of only two polymeric
materials (A,B) or of a polymeric film combined with an
iridescent color masking device.EP-A-0 404 463 discloses a multilayered reflective
body comprising alternating layers of at least first and
second polymeric materials. The layers have an optical
thickness of not more than 0.09µm and not less than 0.45µm
and adjacent layers differ in refractive index by at least
0.03. The reflective body takes on a metallic appearance
and can typically be used in place of a metallic film (such
as will rust or chip) on e.g. headlamps, mirrors, non-corroding
metallic appearing articles, reflectors and
reflective lenses.For some applications, while reflection of infrared
wavelengths is desirable, higher order reflections of
visible light are not. For example, infrared reflecting
films can be laminated to glass in buildings and
automobiles to reduce air conditioning loads. The films
may also be

having at least two major surfaces and which reflects more

than 50 percent light in the infrared region of the
spectrum while transmitting at least 50 percent light in

preceding claims, wherein said color masking means (18) are

located on one or both of said major surfaces of said film
or between interior layers of said film.
A film (10) as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said optically thin layer 

thicknesses (12,14,16) increase monotonically across the
thickness of said film.
A film (10) as claimed in any one of the
