<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an erasing apparatus for 
use in a magnetic recording and reproducing system. A conventional magnetic recording and reproducing system 
such as video cassette recorder ("VCR") includes a rotatable 
helical scanner having a pair of magnetic recording heads 
installed in a diametrically opposite relationship along the 
circumferential outer surface thereof. A magnetic tape is 
wound obliquely around the rotatable helical scanner so that 
video information may be recorded or reproduced on or from the 
magnetic tape by the action of the recording heads in 
accordance with the advance of the magnetic tape concurrently 
with the rotation of the rotatable helical scanner. The conventional VCR is further equipped with a full-erasing 
head for a full-tape width erase of the magnetic tape. 
The full-erasing head is positioned stationary in front of the 
rotatable helical scanner and may be used to erase a 
previously recorded signal prior to recording a new signal on 
the erased portion of the magnetic tape. In such a VCR, however, a non-erased portion may remain  
 
to exist between the inclined scanning line scanned by the 
recording head and the full-erasing head when a recording 
operation is started along with an erasing operation, as shown 
in FIG. 6 as an area marked "A". Therefore, a new signal may 
be written over the non-erased portion, which produce "rainbow 
noises" causing a poor picture for an overlapping time period, 
e.g., 3 to 4 seconds, during the reproduction of the newly 
recorded signal from the magnetic tape. In order to remove or reduce the possibility of having a 
non-erased portion left on the magnetic tape, therefore, there 
has been proposed a VCR system employing a mechanism to make 
a starting position of the scanning line substantially 
coincide with an erasing starting position by adjusting or 
delaying a starting point of recording for a predetermined 
time period "D" during which the non-erased portion is passed 
without recording thereon. However, there still exists the 
possibility of having an overwritten portion on the magnetic 
tape between the erasing head and the delayed scanning line, 
as shown in FIG. 6 as a triangular area marked "B". Therefore, further efforts have been made to minimize the 
gap between the starting position of the scanning line and the 
erasing starting position. As a result, a flying erasing head 
has been suggested, which is further mounted on the rotatable 
helical scanner with relation to the recording heads, as
