<ABSTRACT>
2,5-Diaryl tetrahydrofurans, 2,5-diaryl tetrahydrothiophenes, 2,4-diaryl tetrahydrofurans, 2,4-diaryl tetrahydrothiophenes, 1,3-diaryl cyclopentanes, 2,4-diaryl pyrrolidines, and 2,5-diaryl pyrrolidines are disclosed that reduce the chemotaxis and respiratory burst leading to the formation of damaging oxygen radicals of polymorphonuclear leukocytes during an inflammatory or immune response. The compounds exhibit this biological activity by acting as PAF receptor antagonists, by inhibiting the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, or by exhibiting dual acitivity, i.e., by acting as both a PAF receptor antagonist and inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. A method to treat disorders mediated by PAF or leukotrienes is also disclosed, that includes administering an effective amount of one or more of the above-identified compounds or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the area of pharmaceutical compositions and methods for
the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders, and specifically provides novel
compounds that reduce damage arising from an inflammatory or immune response.
The compounds exhibit this biological activity by acting as PAF receptor antagonists,
by inhibiting the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, or by exhibiting dual activity, i. e., by acting
as both a PAF receptor antagonist and inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase.Platelet activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine)
is a potent inflammatory phospholipid mediator with a wide
variety of biological activities. PAF was initially identified as a water soluble
compound released by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized rabbit basophils. It is now
known that PAF is also generated and released by monocytes, macrophages,
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), eosinophils, neutrophils, natural killer
lymphocytes, platelets and endothelial cells, as well as by renal and cardiac tissues
under appropriate immunological and non-immunological stimulation. (Hwang,
"Specific receptors of platelet-activating factor, receptor heterogeneity, and signal
transduction mechanisms", Journal of Lipid Mediators2. 123 (1990)). PAF causes
the aggregation and degranulation of platelets at very low concentrations. The potency
(active at 10-12 to 10-9M), tissue level (picomoles) and short plasma 1 half life (2-4
minutes) of PAF are similar to those of other lipid mediators such as thromboxane A2,
prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.PAF mediates biological responses by binding to specific PAF receptors
found in a wide variety of cells and tissues. Structure-activity studies on PAF and its
analogs indicate that the ability of PAF to bind to these receptors is highly structure
specific and stereospecific. (Shen, et al., "The Chemical and Biological Properties of
PAF Agonists, Antagonists, and Biosynthetic Inhibitors", Platelet-Activating Factor
and Related Lipid Mediators, F. Snyder. Ed. Plenum Press, New York, NY 153
(1987)).While PAF mediates essential biological responses, it also appears to play a
role in pathological immune and inflammatory responses. Many published studies
have provided evidence for the involvement of PAF in human diseases, including
arthritis, acute inflammation, asthma, endotoxic shock, pain, psoriasis, ophthalmic 
inflammation, ischemia, gastrointestinal ulceration, myocardial infarction.
inflammatory bowel diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Animal
