<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer material is disclosed which is 
useful in a method for forming a color image comprising 

selectively melt-transferring at least one of a yellow 
heat-meltable ink layer, a magenta heat-meltable ink layer 

and a cyan heat-meltable ink layer onto a receptor having 
a multiplicity of micropores in the surface layer thereof 

to enter each ink in a molten state into the micropores, 
thereby forming a color image comprising at least one of 

(A) at least one color region of single color of yellow, 
magenta and cyan, and (B) at least one color region 

developed on the basis of subtractive color mixture of 
at least two of yellow, magenta and cyan. The thermal 

transfer material comprises at least one of a yellow 
heat-meltable ink layer, a magenta heat-meltable ink layer 

and a cyan heat-meltable ink layer provided on a 
foundation or foundations, each ink layer having a melt 

viscosity of 20 to 200 cps/90°C and a coating amount of 
0.5 to 2.5 g/m², the foundation having a thickness of 1.0 

to 4.5 µ m and the thermal transfer material having an 
overall thickness of 2.5 to 7.0 µ m. The thermal transfer 

material gives color images excellent in both color 
reproducibility and resolution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal 
transfer material for use in a method for forming a color 
image, particularly a multi-color or full-color image by 
melt-transferring heat-meltable inks onto a receptor 
having a multiplicity of micropores in the surface layer 
thereof. Heretofore there has been proposed a method for 
forming a multi-color image on a receptor having a 
multiplicity of micropores in the surface layer thereof 
wherein a yellow heat-meltable ink layer, a magenta heat-meltable 
ink layer and a cyan heat-meltable ink layer are 
selectively melt-transferred in succession onto the 
receptor to enter each ink in a molten state into the 
micropores, thereby forming a multi-color image on the 
basis of subtractive color mixture (Institute of 
Television Engineers of Japan (ITE) Technical Report, Vol. 
17, No. 27, pages 19 to 24 (May, 1993). In the GB-A-2069160 a heat sensitive color transfer ribbon 
comprising a foundation having at least two nonoverlapped 
heat sensitive transfer ink layers of different colors on 
one side thereof and which is designed for use in thermal 
color recording system in which the ribbon transfers respective 
color ink layers to a receptor is disclosed.However, 
the color transfer ribbon is not designed for a surface 
layer having micropores. The color image formation method is explained by 
referring to Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1, numeral 1 denotes a 
thermal transfer material wherein heat-meltable ink layers 
3 for respective colors are provided on a foundation 2. 
Numeral 4 denotes a receptor wherein a multiplicity of 
micropores 5 are formed in the surface layer thereof 
(hereinafter referred to as "porous surface receptor" in 
some cases). The diameter and depth of the micropores 5  
 
are on the order of micrometers. In the porous surface 
receptor 4 shown in Fig. 1, the micropores 5 are pictured 
regularly but actual micropores are irregular. The thermal transfer material 1 is superimposed 
onto the receptor 4. The resulting assembly is heated by 
means of a thermal head T (in Fig. 1, only one heating 
element is shown) with being pressed against a platen P, 
whereby the ink in a heated portion is melted and the 
molten ink is entered into micropores 5 mainly by 
capillary action. When the thermal transfer material 1 is  
 
separated from the receptor 4, there is obtained the 
receptor 4 having a color image wherein the ink 6 is 
contained in the micropores 5 in a portion of the receptor 
4 which corresponds to the activated heating elements of
