<ABSTRACT>
Non-flammable, substantially fluorinated compounds of the class of the alkanes and/or dialkyl ethers are suitable for use as heat transfer media, in particular as cooling or insulating medium, especially for evaporative cooling. These compounds can also be employed in a mixture with small amounts of intrinsically flammable liquids, in which case the lower alkanols are preferred.

or a mixture of one of said fluorinated alkanes and one
of said fluorinated ethers.
Method according to Claim 1, where the heat
transfer agent (a) comprises one of the fluorinated

alkanes specified in Claim 1 or one of the fluorinated
ethers specified in Claim 1 or a mixture thereof and,

mixed therewith, (b) a flammable lower hydrocarbon, a
flammable lower alkanol or a flammable lower dialkyl

ether, but the heat transfer agent comprising (a) and
(b) is non-flammable.
Method according to Claim 2, where the heat
transfer agent is an azeotropic mixture.

point of the fluorinated alkane specified in Claim 1

and of the fluorinated ether specified in Claim 1 is at
a temperature of 44Â°C or above. 
Method according to Claims 1 to 4, where the
heat transfer agent (a) comprises one of the

fluorinated alkanes specified in Claim 1.
Method according to Claim 1, where the heat
transfer agent (a) consists of one of the fluorinated

alkanes specified in Claim 1.
Method according to Claims 1 to 4, where the
heat transfer agent (a) comprises one of the

fluorinated ethers specified in Claim 1.
Method according to Claim 1, where the heat
transfer agent (a) consists of one of the fluorinated

ethers specified in Claim 1.
