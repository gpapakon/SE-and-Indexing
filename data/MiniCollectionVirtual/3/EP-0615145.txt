<ABSTRACT>
An optical isolator device comprises a magnet (14) 
having a rectangular channel (21) and a rectangular optical 

isolator element (15) fitted in the channel and fixed to the 
magnet by adhesive (22) filled up in a gap around the element 

in the channel. In order to avoid an increased thickness 
of the adhesive layer which is caused by round corners of 

the rectangular channel in production of the magnet by 
the injection molding, the magnet is forme
d with a small 
slit (41) outwardly extending from each corner of the 

rectangular channel. Thus, the element is fitted in the 
channel without interference of the channel corners and 

is in close contact with at least one (21a) of flat inner 
surfaces (21) of the channel to form a thin gap of 10 microns 

or less therebetween. Accordingly, the element is 
strongly adhered to the inner surface (21a) of the channel by 

the thin adhesive layer of 10 microns or less in the thin 
gap. In another approach, each of corners of the channel 

in the magnet is still round but the element is partially 
and obliquely cut away to form a facet at each of corners 

of the rectangular shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical isolator 
device having an optical axis for permitting an incident 
light beam in a direction along the optical axis to pass 
therethrough and for preventing another incident light 
beam in the opposite direction from passing therethrough, 
according to the preamble of claim 1. As well known in the art, an optical isolator 
device is used in, for example, a laser diode (LD) module 
which comprises a semiconductor laser diode and an 
optical fiber. The optical isolator device is disposed 
between the semiconductor laser diode and the optical 
fiber. An optical axis of the optical isolator device is 
coincident with an optical axis of the semiconductor 
laser diode and an optical axis of the optical fiber 
without offset. The semiconductor laser diode emits a 
light beam which is incident as an incident light beam 
onto an incident end of the optical isolator device. The 
optical isolator device permits the incident light beam 
to pass therethrough. Accordingly, the incident light 
beam emits from an outgoing end of the optical isolator 
device as an outgoing light beam which is, in turn,  
 
incident onto an incident end of the optical fiber. A 
part of the outgoing light beam is reflected on the 
incident end of the optical fiber as a reflected light 
beam. The remainder of the outgoing light beam is 
transmitted through the optical fiber as a transmitting 
light beam. A ratio of intensity of the transmitting 
light beam to intensity of the outgoing light beam is 
called a coupling coefficient. The reflected light beam 
is returned as a return light beam to the outgoing end of 
the optical isolator device in the opposite direction of 
the outgoing light beam. The optical isolator device 
prevents the return light beam from passing therethrough 
in the opposite direction. Therefore, the reflected 
light beam is cut off by the optical isolator device to 
inhibit the semiconductor laser diode from receiving the 
reflected light beam. As a result, it is possible to 
make the semiconductor laser diode operate stably without 
appearance of noise. A conventional optical isolator device, as is disclosed in EP-A-0 512 572 which forms the preamble of claim 1 
comprises a magnet having a rectangular channel which has an inner 
surface and a first central axis. The optical isolator 
element is a body with a rectangular section and has an 
outer surface and a second central axis as an optical 
axis. The rectangular optical isolator element is fitted 
and fixed in the rectangular
