<ABSTRACT>
An assembly which is ready for sale and is suitable for display on shelves of sales stands consists of a slide fastener (2), which can be folded together flat to a fraction of its length, and a parallelepipedic elongate package (4) which can be set up from a packaging cardboard blank by folding. The front wall of the package has, in the region of the upper edge and in the region of the lower edge, a transverse slot (6, 7), which transverse slots (6, 7) define an upper firm front wall section (8) and a lower firm front wall section (9). The front of the package between the transverse slots (6, 7) has a separating slot (10) which allows folding up of the front wall parts (11, 12) bounded by the transverse slots and separated by the separating slot. Arranged centrally in one of the firm front wall sections (8) is a cutout (14) for a slide fastener slider, in which cutout the slide fastener slider (16) is exposed. The upper end of the folded slide fastener (2) emerges below one of the front wall sections (8), is guided over the front wall parts (11, 12) formed by the separating slot (10) and is reintroduced below the opposite front wall section (9).
