<ABSTRACT>
In a method for producing L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine 
by subjecting microorganism cells having a β-tyrosinase 

activity or a product to be obtained by processing them to 
catalytic reaction with catechol, pyruvic acid and ammonium 

ion or with catechol and L-serine, the reaction is continued 
at a temperature lower than 25°C under the condition where 

anhydrous crystals of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine exist in 
the reaction mixture while L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine being 

formed are made precipitated as anhydrous crystals in the 
reaction mixture, and the thus-precipitated anhydrous 

crystals are collected. 
According to the method of the present invention, crude 
crystals of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine having a high purity 

may be obtained at a high yield of recovery, by simple means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (hereinafter referred to as L-DOPA).
L-DOPA has been popularly used as a medicine for curing
Parkinson's disease.To produce L-DOPA, heretofore, a synthetic method starting
from vanillin has been known. On the other hand, other
methods for producing L-DOPA have been investigated, using an
enzymatic system of microorganisms. Examples include a method
for producing L-DOPA from catechol, pyruvic acid and ammonium
ion, using β-tyrosinase (JP-B 48-34237 - the term "JP-B" as
used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication"),
a method for producing the same from catechol and L-serine
and other amino acids, also using β-tyrosinase (JP-B 47-22275),
a method for producing the same from dihydroxycinnamic
acid and ammonium ions, using ammonia lyase (JP-B 62-24076),
a method for producing the same from L-phenylalanine
or L-tyrosine, using oxygenase (JP-B 47-19033, 47-14915), a
method for producing the same from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpyruvic
acid, using transaminase (JP-B 58-18475), etc.It is known that there are two kinds of crystals of L-DOPA,
including monohydrated crystals and anhydrous crystals.
Regarding the crystalline morphology, monohydrated crystals 
of L-DOPA are needle-like crystals, while anhydrous crystals
of the same are tetragonal crystals. To purify L-DOPA, there
is known a method of crystallizing needle-like crystals of L-DOPA
from an aqueous L-DOPA solution containing impurities at
a low temperature not higher than 30 °C followed by heating
them at a temperature not lower than 30 °C so as to convert
them into tetragonal crystals by polymorphic transition and
separating the thus-converted tetragonal crystals from the
solution (JP-B 49-41188). According to the method, L-DOPA is
crystallized as needle-like crystals whereby the color
substances and other impurities that have been in the crude
L-DOPA obtained in the production step are effectively
removed. Afterwards, the needle-like crystals are separated
and then converted into tetragonal crystals of pure L-DOPA by
polymorphic transition.The present inventors succeeded in the production and
accumulation of an extremely high concentration of L-DOPA by
improving a method of producing L-DOPA which uses β-tyrosinase
(JP-A 5-123177 - the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application").
According to the improved method, L-DOPA is produced and accumulated
in the reaction mixture at a concentration higher
than the solubility of
