<DESCRIPTION>
The invention deals with compounds having activity as 
phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors. PLA2 is a calcium-dependent 
enzyme which cleaves the sn-2 acyl bond of phospholipids to yield 
arachidonic acid and a lysophospholipid (H. Van den Bosch et al. in 
Biochim. Biophys. Acta1980, 604, 191). Both products of this reaction 
can serve as starting points for the biosynthesis of inflammatory 
mediators. Once released, arachidonic acid is rapidly metabolized by 
enzymes such as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases to give 
prostaglandins and leukotrienes, well-known mediators of 
inflammation (P. Davies and D.E. MacIntyre in "Inflammation: Basic 
Principles and Clinical Correlates," 2nd Ed., J.I. Gallin, I.M. Goldstein, 
and R. Snyderman, Eds., Raven Press, Ltd.: New York, 1992; Chapter 7; 
B.K. Lam and K.F. Austen in "Inflammation: Basic Principles and 
Clinical Correlates," 2nd Ed., J.I. Gallin, I.M. Goldstein, and R. 
Snyderman, Eds., Raven Press, Ltd.: New York, 1992; Chapter 8). 
Lysophospholipids can be utilized by certain cell types to produce 
platelet-activating factor (PAF), another potent inflammatory mediator 
(G.A. Zimmerman, S.M. Prescott, and T.M. McIntyre in 
"Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates," 2nd Ed., J.I. 
Gallin, I.M. Goldstein, and R. Snyderman, Eds., Raven Press, Ltd.: New 
York, 1992; Chapter 9). The role of PLA2 in inflammatory diseases has 
been described (P. Vadas and W. Pruzanski in Laboratory 
Investigation, 1986, 55, 391-404; W. Pruzanski, E. Bogoch, M. Wloch, 
and P. Vadas in Journal of Rheumatology,1991, 18, 117-119; W. 
Pruzanski, K. Scott, G. Smith, I. Rajkovic, E. Stefanski, and P. Vadas in 
Inflammation, 1992, 16, 451-457; W. Pruzanski, D.W. Wilmore, A. 
Suffredini, G.D. Martich, A.G.D. Hoffman, J.L. Browning, E. Stefanski, 
B. Sternby, and P. Vadas in Inflammation, 1992, 16, 561-570; J.M.  
 
Gronroos and T.J. Nevalainen in Digestion, 1992, 52, 232-236). Since 
PLA2 is the critical enzyme in the pathway leading to release of 
prostaglandins and leukotrienes and PAF, inhibition of this enzyme is 
a rational approach to prevention, elimination, or amelioration of 
inflammation. Compounds having similar activity are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
5,141,959, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. 
That patent discloses compounds of structure A:
