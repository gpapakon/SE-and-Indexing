<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 15 mer peptide that is the epitope repeat
sequence for a predominant antigen of T. cruzi. The inventive peptide is useful for
diagnosing T. cruzi infection and for use in a vaccine to immunize an individual to
reduce T. cruzi infection and clinical manifestations of Chagas disease.Chagas disease is one of the most important endemic problems in Central and
South America, for which no definitive chemotherapeutic or immunological treatment is
available. Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is the agent of Chagas disease. Infection with
a protozoan parasite T. cruzi, the causitive agent of Chagas disease, occurs in an
estimated 18 million persons throughout Latin America and is a major cause of chronic
heart disease. Immune responses after T. cruzi infection are particularly complex due
to the biochemical diversity of multiple parasite strains and influence of host-genetic
factors. The result is a wide diversity in clinical manifestations of Chagas disease and,
in some cases, the disruption of immune regulation leading to immunosuppression
and/or development of autoimmunity. This parasite has a complex life cycle involving
an epimastigote stage in the insect vector and two main stages in the mammalian host.
One stage is present in blood (trypomastigote) and a second stage is intracellular
(amastigote).The acute phase of T. cruzi infection is often asymptomatic. The infection may
remain quiescent for decades. Some patients may, however, develop a progressive
chronic form of the disease with cardiac and/or digestive tract alterations. After the
acute phase with parasitemia, parasite growth is usually controlled by the host and
patients or animals enter into a chronic phase where few parasites are present in the
blood.Immune responses to protozoan infection are complex, involving both humoral
and cell-mediated responses to an array of parasite antigens. Infection often involves
multiple life cycle stages of these parasites, which adds to the diversity of antigens
potentially important for the development of protective immunity. To examine the 
molecular basis of the immune responses elicited during these infections, recent efforts
have focused on evaluating responses to defined parasite B- and T-cell epitopes.T. cruzi infections are often subtle and long-lasting, making diagnosis crucial
and problematic. Detecting antibodies against parasite antigens is a most common and
reliable method of determining clinical and subclinical infections. Presently, serological
tests use whole or
