<ABSTRACT>
Device for feeding oil from the lubricating oil system of 
an internal combustion engine to units (18) mounted on a 

unit supporting plate (4) secured to the engine block 
(2). On one side (12) of the unit supporting plate (4) 

there are one or more oil distribution ducts (14) 
incorporated in the plate, each of which is connected to 

the lubricating oil system of the engine and at least one 
associated unit (18), and which is covered, on the 

surface (12) of the plate, by a cover plate (24) secured 
in the unit supporting plate (4). Each duct groove (22) 

has its associated cover plate (24) preferably secured in 
the unit supporting plate (4) by shape and/or friction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device of the type indicated 
in the preamble to patent claim 1. In motor vehicles, particularly heavier vehicles such as 
trucks and buses, there is an increasing need to provide 
or coordinate the vehicle engine with additional units of 
different types. In this case it may be a question both 
of units belonging to the engine such as an injection 
pump or a turbocompressor unit, and of units driven by 
the engine, for example an air compressor in a compressed 
air system for brake operation, or other equipment 
interacting with the engine. In the case of heavier trucks and buses in particular the 
vehicle engine is often a diesel engine operating on the 
basis of supercharging generated by means of a turbo-compressor. 
Lock-free braking systems are frequently 
also used in such vehicles, the brakes being operated by 
a compressed air system. A common feature of these types 
of vehicles and engines is the need to be able to fit the 
equipment concerned, and the units required for it, on or 
close to the vehicle engine, for drive and functional 
reasons. In a number of cases the equipment and units 
also require to be fitted with efficient lubricating oil 
systems. It is then appropriate for these lubricating oil 
systems to be coordinated with the engine lubricating 
system, and in practice this is achieved by incorporating 
the lubricating systems of the equipment/units 
respectively in the engine lubricating oil system. According to prior art equipment/units of the type 
discussed above are mounted on a common supporting part 
securely fitted to the vehicle engine. The type of  
 
supporting part used may, for example, be a supporting 
plate normally secured to the short side of the engine 
block adjacent to the clutch integral with the engine. 
This type of supporting plate is normally called a 
transmission plate. Lubricating oil is then normally fed 
to/from the equipment or units mounted on the transmission 
plate via external hoses or pipes which connect 
lubricating oil ducts of the equipment/units to 
lubricating oil ducts in the engine block. In this case 
the connections between the ends of the hoses/pipes and 
equipment/units and engine block respectively are 
normally made by means of nipples. In order to avoid the need for such external hoses/pipes 
between the units/equipment and engine block altogether, 
or at least to minimise this requirement, solutions have 
also been developed where the external hose and pipe connections 
have been replaced by die cast or

<CLAIMS>
Device for feeding oil from the lubricating oil 
system of an internal combustion engine to at least one 

or more units (16, 18, 20) mounted on a unit supporting 
plate (4) secured to the engine, 
characterised
 
in that the unit supporting plate (4) is 

provided with at least one oil distribution duct (14) in 

the plate, which duct has at least one first connection 
(32) to the lubricating oil system of the engine, and at 

least one second connection (34) to one of the units, 
which distribution duct (14) consists of a groove (22) 

made from one surface (12, 13) of the unit supporting 
plate (4), in the plate, which groove is covered, on the 

surface of the plate by means of a cover plate (24) 
secured to the plate (4). 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised
 
in that the groove (22) is made in the unit 

supporting plate (4) on the side (12) facing away from 
the engine block (2), where the groove (22) is 

essentially straight and continuous. 
Device according to one of claims 1-2, 
characterised
 
in that the first connection (32) is 

connected to an engine block duct (8) connected to the 
lubricating oil system of the engine. 
Device according to one of claims 1-3, 
characterised
 
in that the unit supporting plate (4) 

is an essentially flat plate containing several separate 
oil distribution ducts (14), each of which is connected 

at one end to the engine block duct (8) and at the other 
end to each of its associated units (16, 18, 20), where 

each groove (22) is provided with its own cover plate 
(24).  

 
Device according to claim 4, 
characterised
 
in that the oil distribution ducts (14) consist 

of grooves, preferably of the same width, made in the 
unit supporting plate (4) by cutting machining, and 

covered with individual cover plates (24). 
Device according to one of claims 1-5, 
characterised
 
in that each grove (22) has its own 

associated cover plate (24) secured in the unit 
supporting plate by shape and/or friction. 
Device according to claim 6, 
characterised
 
in that the respective cover plates (24) are 

secured in the unit supporting plate (4) in a dovetail 
groove (26) which overlaps the associated distribution 

duct (14) and which extends the entire length of the 
groove (22) and exhibits a cross-section (B) which 

exceeds the width (V) of the duct groove. 
Device according to claim 7, 
characterised
 
in that the cover plate (24) secured in the 

dovetail groove (26) exhibits a somewhat arch-shaped 
cross-sectional profile (P) before fastening, enabling 

the cover plate to be fastened in the dovetail groove 
(26) by upsetting the plate in the centre so that the 

cover plate edges are pressed outwards and are caused to 
engage lock-tight with the respective undercut edge side 

surfaces of the dovetail groove (26). 
Device according to one of claims 2-8, 
characterised
 
in that the first and second 

connection (32, 34) respectively consist of through holes 
extending, at the respective ends of the duct (14), 

between the bottom (36) of the duct and the side (13) of 
the unit supporting plate (4) facing towards the engine 

block.  
 
Device according to one of the previous claims, 

characterised
 in that the unit supporting 
plate (4) is secured to the engine at the end of the 

engine bock (2) adjacent to a clutch connected to the 
engine, and in that the unit supporting plate (4) 

projects to the side from the engine bock on both sides 
of the engine, and supports on each side at least one of 

the units (16, 18, 20).
