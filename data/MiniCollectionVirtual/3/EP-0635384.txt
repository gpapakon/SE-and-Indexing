A support device S for the tread of a tyre P, 
comprising at least one rigid support (1), the radially 

outer portion of which forms a bearing ring (12), of 
maximum axial width L, and an elastic cap (2) of 

vulcanised rubber mix, the thickness e
2
 of which is at 
most equal to 50% of the total height H
2
 of the device 
and of maximum axial width L', said cap (2) surrounding 

the bearing ring (12), and a lubricant product being 
disposed between the ring (12) and the cap (2) to 

permit the circumferential displacement of the cap (2) 
relative to the ring (12), characterised in that 


the maximum axial width L' of the elastic cap (2) 
is greater than the maximum axial width L of the 

ring (12) of the support (1); 
the shape of the radially outer face (121, 123) of 
the bearing ring (12) of the support (1) 

cooperates with reinforcement elements (21, 23) 
arranged in the elastic cap (2) in order to ensure 

the radial holding and circumferential guiding of 
said cap (2) on the support (1), and the device S 

being provided with means (3) for ensuring the 
holding thereof on the mounting rim J of the tyre 

P equipped with said device S. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the bearing ring (12) of the support (1) comprises 

a ring base (120) and, axially on opposite sides, two 
ring shoulde
rs (122), the radially outer face (121) of 
said ring base (120) being further from the axis of 

rotation of the device S than the radially outer faces 
(123) of the shoulders (122). 
A device according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the radial distance between the radially outer 

face (121) of the base (120) and the faces (123) of the  
 

shoulders (122) is at least equal to 0.25 times the 
thickness e
2
 of the cap (2). 
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the reinforcement elements of the elastic cap (2) 

include, radially on the inside of each of the edges of 
the cap, a bead wire (21) of braided type coated with a 

rubber mix, said bead wire being intended to be 
arranged axially on the outer face (123) of the 

shoulder (122), and the inner radius R
2
 of said bead 
wire (21) is less than the maximum outer radius R
1
 of 
the bearing ring (12) of the support (1). 
A device according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the cap (2) furthermore includes a reinforcement 

armature (23) of metal cables of steel, turned up 
around the bead wires (21) to form turn-ups (230). 
A device according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the cap (2) comprises a tread (24) provided with 

at least two circumferential grooves (240). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the bearing ring (12) of the support (1) has at 

its centre a groove (125) located axially between two 
shoulders (122), the radial distance e
4
 between the 
bottom B of the groove (125) and the imaginary straight 

line D connecting the points of the radially outer 
faces (123) of the shoulders (122) being at least equal 

to 0.25 times the thickness e
2
 of the cap (2). 
A device according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the cap (2) is provided on its inner face with a 

circumferential central rib (25), reinforced by a 
single bead wire (21), the outer radius R
4
 of which is 
less than the radial distance between the straight line 

D and the axis of rotation of said device. 
A device according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the cap (2) furthermore includes a reinforcement 

armature (23) composed of at least one ply of cords or 
cables (230) of a width L'' substantially equal to the  

 
width L of the bearing ring (12), and passing radially 

below the bead wire (21). 
A device according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that the reinforcement armature (23) also comprises two 

narrow plies (231) of circumferentially oriented cords 
or cables arranged symmetrically on both sides of the 

equatorial plane of the device. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the means (3) for ensuring the 

holding on the mounting rim J of the tyre, equipped 
with said device, consist of a meridianly split elastic 

ring (3) comprising, seen in meridian section, a 
substantially rectangular base surmounted on its edges 

by two lateral ribs.
