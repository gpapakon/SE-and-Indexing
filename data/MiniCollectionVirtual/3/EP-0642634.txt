<CLAIMS>
Drum-brake device comprising: 

a clevis (3); 
first and second arcuate brake shoes (1, 2) having 
respective first and second ends (1a, 2a; 1b, 2b) facing 

one another; 
an expander (8) fastened to the clevis and 
actuatable to move apart the first ends of the two shoes; 
a spacer (9) of which the length is adjusted by a 
screw element (9b) and which holds the second ends (1b, 

2b) of the two shoes at a distance from one another; and 
regulation means for regulating the length of the 
spacer in dependence on the wear of the shoes, said means 

comprising a toothed wheel (11) fastened to the screw 
element, a rocking lever which carries a click (13, 12) 

and is pivoted on the second shoe (2) and which is 
capable of turning said toothed wheel in a direction such 

as to lengthen the spacer, and a linkage for actuating 
the rocking lever, said linkage in turn comprising a 

lever (16) pivoted at a point (2c) on the second shoe and 
two rods (17, 18) connected by said lever, the first rod 

having a first end (17a) pivoted on a support point (1c) 
and a second end (17b) pivoted on said lever to move the 

latter in the event of the actuation of the expander, and 
the second rod having a first end (18a) pivoted on the 

lever and a second end (18b) pivoted on the rocking lever 
such as to transmit to the latter the motion of the 

lever, characterized in that the support point is a point 
on the first shoe whereas the first and second shoes are 

mounted floating on the clevis. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pivot point (2c) of the lever, the second end 

(17b) of the first rod, and the first end (17a) of this 
same rod define a first angle close to 120Â° or greater 

than that value. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the pivot point (2c) of the lever is substantially  

 
equidistant from said second end (17b) of said first rod 

and from the first end (18a) of the second rod. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the first and second ends (18a, 18b) of the second 

rod define a direction at least close to that of the 
bisector of the first angle. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that said lever (16) comprises essentially a ring (16a) 

connected to the second shoe by a hook (16b) passing 
through an aperture made in said shoe, and in that the 

second end (17b) of the first rod and the first end (18a) 
of the second rod are looped over the ring such as to 

engage around it. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the expander is of a mechanical type.
