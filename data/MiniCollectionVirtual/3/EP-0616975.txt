<ABSTRACT>
A point of use water purification system for home 
use is provided comprising a carbon block filter (20) 

housed in a self-contained disposable pressure vessel 
(28) for removing particulates and organic contaminants 

from water. The filter is provided with a pore-size 
distribution, a binder and a flow path which optimizes 

filtration performance and enhances microbiological kill 
rates obtained in a source of radiant energy (21) which 

is used to kill microorganisms in the filtered water. 
The source of radiant energy comprises an ultraviolet 

discharge lamp having an elongate central axis and a 
diverter (100) for providing a spiral plug flow of water 

about the discharge lamp. A flow regulator (116) adjusts 
flow through the system for varying line pressure 

conditions to ensure adequate exposure of microorganisms 
to ultraviolet energy. A lamp control circuit conserves 

power and optimizes ultraviolet output. A diagnostic 
system includes a filter monitor which provides an 

automatic indication to the user when the filter has 
reached its end of life. The diagnostic system includes 

a radiation source monitor which provides an automatic 
indication to the user when the UV discharge bulb has 

malfunctioned. A filter quick-disconnect, a radiation 
source quick-disconnect and associated power safety 

interlocks protect the user and facilitate the safe and 
easy replacement of the disposable filter cartridge and 

ultraviolet discharge bulb.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to home
water purification systems and, more particularly, to a
high performance, self-contained, point of use water
purification unit that features a replaceable activated
carbon filter, a replaceable ultraviolet radiation source
and a diagnostic system that signals when the unit
requires maintenance.In the industrial arts, it is known to use an
activated charcoal filter in combination with a radiation
source to filter and purify water. For example, such
systems are used in the production of bottled water. The
adaptation of this technology to home use has been
difficult. Industrial systems are large, expensive and
require special knowledge and tools to maintain. The
expense of these systems is often due to the fact that
they are designed to process water volumes many times
larger than those required for home use. Other
challenges encountered when designing such a water
treatment system for home use stem from the varying
operating conditions in each home. For example, water
quality, water line pressure, water demand and the
sophistication of the user will vary in different homes.Some water purifiers intended for home use are known
which combine activated carbon filters with an
ultraviolet (UV) radiation source. However, these home
units have had a limited success due to inherent problems
with their design that make maintenance of the units by
the homeowner difficult and inconvenient. This can
result in a water purification unit that, in time,
operates only marginally if at all. Where the water
purification unit is being used with a source of drinking
water that contains contaminants or microbiological 
activity, this lack of maintenance can have serious
consequences.The effectiveness of radiation in the killing of
microorganisms is dependent on a number of factors. One
important factor is the status of the source of radiant
energy. For example, the performance of most known
ultraviolet discharge bulb designs degrades with time.
It is therefore desirable to monitor the radiant energy
source and alert the user if there is a malfunction.
Some artisans have provided a removable housing cover for
inspecting wiring and other electrical connections, yet
have not provided a safe and convenient way of removing
the radiation source without first removing an array of
electrical connections and/or structural members. Thus,
it is desirable to provide a substantially self-contained
radiant energy source which is easy and safe to replace
when there is a malfunction.Another
