<DESCRIPTION>
 FLANGED BEARINGSThis invention is concerned with flanged half bearings and with methods of manufacturing such bearings.Flanged half bearings are used, for example, for supporting crankshafts for rotation in crank cases. The bearings are manufactured as half bearings for assembly purposes and a full bearing is provided by two half bearings each embracing half of the shaft. Each half bearing has a plain bearing surface against which the shaft can rotate, this surface being provided by a shell portion which comprises a layer of bearing material, such as aluminium tin alloy, mounted on a steel backing layer. The flange portion of the half bearing extends radially outwardly at one axial end of the bearing and provides a thrust surface which enables the flange portion to act as a thrust washer to prevent axial movement of the bearing. The thrust surface has a plurality of radially extending grooves therein which assist in the distribution of oil. There may be a further similar flange portion at the opposite axial end of the bearing. Such flange portions also comprise a layer of metal bearing material mounted on a steel backing layer. Conventionally, such flanged half bearings either have the backing layers of the or each flange portion and the backing layer of the shell portion formed integrally, which is a difficult operation, or have the backing layers formed separately and mechanically secured together, which requires time-consuming assembly operations. 

 It is an object of the present invention to provide a flanged half bearing which is easier to manufacture than conventional flanged half bearings.The invention provides a flanged half bearing comprising a shell portion providing a plain bearing surface against which a shaft can rotate, and a flange portion extending radially outwardly at one axial end of the bearing, the flange portion providing a thrust surface to resist axial movement of the bearing, characterised in that the thrust surface is formed from injection moulded plastics material.A flanged half bearing, according to the invention, can be more easily manufactured than a conventional all- metal half bearing, because, if the construction is integrally moulded, no forming operation is required and, if the flange portion is formed separately, the resilience of the plastics material can be used to assist the mechanical connection between the components giving a simple assembly operation. Furthermore, the flange portion can have oil grooves and, if desired, oil film formation- enhancing shapes,

CLAIMS
A flanged half bearing (10;50) comprising a shell portion (12;52) providing a plain bearing surface (14;54) against which a shaft can rotate, and a flange portion (16;56) extending radially outwardly at one axial end of the bearing, the flange portion providing a thrust surface (20;60) to resist axial movement of the bearing, characterised in that the thrust surface is formed from injection moulded plastics material.
A half bearing according to Claim 1, characterised in that the bearing also comprises a further flange portion (18;58) extending radially outwardly at the other axial end of the bearing, the further flange portion providing a further thrust surface (22;62) which is also formed from injection moulded plastics material.
A half bearing according to either one of Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the shell portion (12;52) comprises a layer of bearing material (32;72) providing the plain bearing surface (14;54) , and a backing layer (34) on which the bearing material layer is mounted, the backing layer being joined to the or each flange portion (16;18;56;58) .
A half bearing according to Claim 3, characterised in that the backing layer (34) is formed from injection moulded plastics material.
A half bearing according to Claim 4, characterised in that the plastics material of the backing layer (34) and the plastics material of the or each flange portion (16;18) are moulded as one piece. 


A half bearing according to Claim 5, characterised in that the a plastics hinge (35) joins the or each flange portion (16;18) to the backing layer (34).
A half bearing according to any one of the Claims 3 to 6, characterised in that the bearing material layer has keying means (36) which is embedded in the backing layer to secure the layers (32;34) of the shell portion (12) together.
A half bearing according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the shell portion (52) is joined to the or each flange portion (56;58) by projections (67) which project from one of the portions and are retained in recesses (65) in another of the portions.
A half bearing according to Claim 8, characterised in that the projections (67) are loosely retained in the recesses (65) so that the or each flange portion (56;58) can move axially to a limited extent relative to the shell portion (52) .
A half bearing according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the or each thrust surface (20;22;60;62) is profiled to provide one or more wedge-shaped surface portions, extending along the thrust surface.
A half bearing according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the or each flange portion (16;18;56;58) is formed as a hollow injection moulding containing one or more chambers (90;92) .
A half bearing according to Claim 11, characterised in that the or each chamber (90) is wedge-shaped in the direction of the thrust surface. 


 A half bearing according to either one of Claims 11 and 12, characterised in that the or each chamber (90;92) is filled with material which is more resilient than the plastics material forming the thrust surface (22;22;60;62) .
A method of manufacturing a flanged half bearing according to Claim 1, characterised in that the method comprises placing a layer (32) of bearing material adapted to provide the plain bearing surface (14) of the shell portion (12) of the bearing in the mould of an injection moulding machine; and injecting plastics material into the mould so that the plastics material forms said flange portion (16) and, on solidification, bonds the flange portion to the shell portion.
A method of manufacturing a flanged half bearing according to Claim l, characterised in that the method comprises injection moulding from plastics material a flange (56;58) adapted to form the flange portion of the half bearing, and, after solidification of the plastics material, securing said flange to a shell (12) adapted to form the shell portion of the bearing.
