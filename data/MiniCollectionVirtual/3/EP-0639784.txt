<ABSTRACT>
This polarised-light box includes an extended light source (1) with an output window (2) equipped with an interference filter (3) and with a cholesteric polariser (4) followed by a quarter-wave plate (5). By virtue of the interference filter and the cholesteric polariser, light energy not having the desired polarisation or the correct directivity is sent back towards the light source so as to acquire thereat, by multiple reflections, the directivity and the polarisation which are desired. The result is an excellent light output (efficiency).

<CLAIMS>
Polarized light box comprising an extended light
source (1), the said source having an exit window (2)

equipped with an interference filter (3) allowing through
those light rays having a near-normal angle of incidence

and reflecting the others, characterized in that it
furthermore comprises, on its exit window (2), following

the interference filter (3), a cholesteric polarizer
which reflects one of the right or left circularly

polarized components of the light rays and allows the
other through.
Polarized light box according to Claim 1, characterized
in that it further comprises a quarter-wave plate

(5) placed after the cholesteric polarizer (4).
Polarized light box according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the extended light source (1
) is a
cathode-ray tube with a screen window (2) coated internally

with a layer of electroluminescent phosphorus (6),
affixed to the said interference filter (3).
Polarized light box according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the interference filter (3) is placed

inside the cathode-ray tube on the internal wall of its
screen window (2) in contact with the layer of

electroluminescent phosphorus (6).
Polarized light box according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the extended light source comprises an

array of fluorescent tubes positioned behind a diffusive
screen against which the interference filter is placed.
Polarized light box according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the interference filter (5) is formed by 

a deposit of successive thin layers of transparent
materials having alternately high and low refractive

indices.
Polarized light box according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the interference filter (5) is constituted

by a hologram.
