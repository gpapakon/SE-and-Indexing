<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an awning with an awning-canvas reel (2) which is retained rotatably between two bearing cheeks (3) and is intended for an awning canvas (1), in each case one bearing cheek (3) being fixed at one end (5') of a support bar (5) which extends over the length of the awning-canvas reel (2). Fastened beneath the awning-canvas reel (2), on the support bar (5), are extension arms (6) for an opening-out bar (8) on which the awning canvas (1) is secured. Further provided is a covering (9) which is supported on the support bar (5) and engages over the awning-canvas reel (2). In order to achieve good protection of the awning-canvas reel (2), along with easy accessibility, it is proposed to draw the support bar (5), designed as a hollow profile, upwards to behind the awning-canvas reel (2) and to provide, on the hollow profile, a border (10) which runs in the longitudinal direction of the support bar (5) and on which there is secured a fastening border (11) which extends essentially over the length of the hollow profile and belongs to the covering.

Awning with a fabric roller (2) for an awning fabric (1), 
which roller is rotatably held between two bearing cheeks (3), 

a bearing cheek (3) being fixed to each end (5') of a support bar 
(5), which extends over the length of the fabric roller (2) and 

with cantilever arms (6) for a fall-out bar (8) fastened to the 
support bar (5) below the fabric roller (2), to which rod (8) the 

awning fabric can be fixed as well as a cover (9) supported on 
the support bar (5) and engaging over the fabric roller (2), 

characterised in that the support bar (5) constructed as a hollow 
section is raised up to behind the fabric roller (2) and 

comprises an edge (10) extending in the longitudinal direction 
of the support bar (5), on which edge is fixed a fastening edge 

(11) of the cover extending substantially over the length of the 
hollow section (5). 
Awning according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
fastening edge (11) of the cover (9), preferably having a U-shaped 

construction, engages over the edge (10) of the hollow 
section (5), in particular is wedged thereon. 
Awning according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
on the side remote from the fabric roller (2), the edge (10) of 

the hollow section (5) comprises a back taper (12) preferably 
extending over the length of the hollow section (5), for the 

engagement of a support arm (21) of a wall mounting (20). 
Awning according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that fastened to the support bar (5) is a lower shell (15) 

engaging beneath the fabric roller (2), the lower shell (15) 
preferably having a fastening edge (14) facing the support bar 

(5), which fastening edge (14) can be suspended in a fastening 
device (13) of the support section (5). 
Awning according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
longitudinal edge (16) of the lower shell (15) facing the cover  

 
(9) is constructed as a particularly rounded support edge for the 

awning fabric (1) and the support edge (16) is preferably 
overlapped by the cover (9). 
Awning according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
support edge (16) is provided as a retraction abutment for the 

fall-out bar (8). 
Awning according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that the cover (9), the lower shell (15), the upper edge (10) 

of the hollow section (5) and the bearing cheeks (3) form a 
largely closed housing for the fabric roller (2). 
Awning according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that on its side (8a) facing the fabric roller (2), the fall-out 

bar (8) is rounded with a radius corresponding approximately 
to the radius of the fabric roller (2), the fall-out bar (8) 

preferably having a longitudinal groove (30) open towards the 
cover (9), into which the longitudinal edge (9a) of the cover (9) 

remote from the hollow section (5) projects when the awning is 
retracted. 
Awning according to Claim 8, characterised in that when 
the awning is retracted, the side (31) of the longitudinal groove 

(30) lying below the cover (9) bears against the retraction 
abutment of the lower shell (15). 
Awning according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
side (31) of the longitudinal groove (30) lying below the cover 

(9) when the awning is retracted comprises a receiving groove 
(33) for a tack (24) in the longitudinal edge (26) of the awning 

fabric (1), the receiving groove (33) preferably being open 
towards the longitudinal groove (30). 
Awning according to Claim 9 or 10, characterised in that 
the side (31) is bent in the direction of the fabric roller (2).
