<ABSTRACT>
In the device for dispensing solid medication from blister packs, consisting of a tray-like bottom part and a hood-like top part, the bottom part (2) is provided with an axle (13). Furthermore, it has cutouts (10) arranged concentrically to the axle (13). One end of the axle (13) is designed as an axis of rotation and translatory guide for the top part (1). The top part (1) engages over the bottom part (2) and has a hub (15) which is supported via a spring (6) on the axle (13). Arranged parallel to the hub (15) on the top part (1) is a ram (8) which, in a corresponding position of the top part (1) relative to the bottom part (2), is flush with one of the cutouts (10) in each case. The other end of the axle (13) is provided with a journal (11) for receiving a bearing plate (7) for the blister pack (5). The bearing plate (7) has holes (9) which, together with the cutouts (10) of the bottom part (2), form passages for the ram (8).

An apparatus for removing solid medications (24) 
from blister packs (5), comprising a shell-shaped 

bottom part (2) and a hood-shaped top part (1) on 
which there is disposed a ram (8) by means of which 

a medication can be forced out of a blister 
compartment, wherein the bottom part (2) is provided 

with an axle (13) and exhibits recesses (10) for 
receiving the blister compartments (20), which are 

disposed concentrically to the axle (13), the one 
end of the axle (13) is configured as a rotational 

axis and translational guide for the top part (1), 
the top part (1) reaches over the bottom part (2) 

and exhibits a hub (15), which is supported on the 
axle (13) by means of a spring (6), parallel to the 

hub (15) on the top part (1) there is disposed the 
ram (8) which, given an appropriate rotational 

setting of the top part (1) relative to the bottom 
part (2), is aligned with respectively one of the 

recesses (10), the other end of the axle (13) is 
provided with a journal (11) for receiving a bearing 

plate (7) for the blister pack (5), and the bearing 
plate (7) exhibits holes (9), which form with the 

recesses (10) of the bottom part (2) passages for 
the ram (8). 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
bottom part (2) is provided with a base ring (12), 

on which there are disposed markings (3) for the 
passages, and the top part (1) exhibits an indicator  

 
(4) for the position of the ram (8). 
The apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 and 2, 
wherein the bottom part (2) and the top part (1) are 

provided with devices for an incremental progression 
of the ram (8) from passage to passage. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
bottom part (2) and the bearing plate (7) enclose a 

space (19).
