<ABSTRACT>
A container casing (10) for a disc cartridge (1) includes an upper casing half (11) 
and a lower casing half (12). The upper casing half (11) has a rectangular-shaped first 

planar surface section (13) and three sidewall sections (14-16) integrally formed with 
the rectangular-shaped first planar section (13) for extending along three sides of the 

first planar surface section (13), and is formed of a synthetic resin material. The lower 
casing half (12) has a rectangular-shaped second planar surface section (25) and three 

sidewall sections (26-28) integrally formed with the rectangular-shaped second planar 
surface section (25) for extending along three sides of the second planar surface section 

(25), and is formed of a synthetic resin material. The respective sidewall sections of 
the upper (11) and lower (12) casing halves are interconnected such that the second 

planar surface section (25) is parallel to the first planar surface section (13) and an 
aperture is defined via which the disc cartridge (1) is inserted into the inside of the 

container casing (10). The mutually parallel sidewall sections of one of the upper (11) 
and lower (12) halves have first and second protrusions (20,21), while the remaining 

sidewall section (16) perpendicular to the mutually parallel sidewall sections (14,15) has 
an engagement rib (19). The mutually parallel sidewall sections (26,27) of the other of 

the upper casing half (11) and the lower casing half (12) have first and second grooves 
(30,31) engaged by the first and second protrusions (20,21), while the remaining 

sidewall section (28) perpendicular to the mutually parallel sidewall sections (26,27) has 
an engagement recess (34) engaged by the engagement rib (19). The mutually parallel 

sidewall sections of one of the upper (11) and lower (12) casing halves have a pair of 
resilient holding portions (23,24) for holding the disc cartridge (1) inserted into the 

container casing (10) by being engaged with recesses (9a,9b) formed in the disc 
cartridge (1) inserted via the aperture. The other of the upper (11) and lower (12) 

casing halves has clearances (26A,27A) for allowing resilient deflection of the resilient 
holding portions (23,24). The resilient holding portions (23,24) are integrally formed in  

 
the mutually parallel sidewall sections of the upper (11) and lower (12) casing halves 

for being resiliently flexible in directions towards the inside and the outside of the 
container casing (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container casing for a disc 
cartridge. More particularly, to a container casing 
for a disc cartridge having an upper cartridge half and a lower 
cartridge half. A so-called sleeve casing has been proposed as a casing for 
containing a disc cartridge having a cartridge main member and 
an information recording medium, such as an optical disc, rotatably 
contained in the cartridge main member. The sleeve casing includes 
a sheet member of synthetic resin material, such as polypropylene 
or polyethylene terephthalate, or carton board, which is bent into 
a casing having an aperture on its one lateral side. The disc 
cartridge is introduced via the aperture into the inside of the 
sleeve casing. The sleeve casing is dimensioned to snugly receive the disc 
cartridge therein. This permits the disc cartridge contained  
 
therein to be held in its housed position under the force of 
friction between the outer lateral surface of the disc cartridge 
and the inner lateral surface of the sleeve casing. With the above-described sleeve casing, formed by bending the 
sheet member, it is difficult to afford sufficient toughness to the 
sleeve casing because it has a thickness just large enough to allow 
for its bending. Consequently, if an external pressure is applied 
to the sleeve casing having the disc cartridge contained therein, 
the sleeve casing is deformed easily. The result is that the disc 
cartridge contained in the sleeve casing is fractured or deformed 
under the influence of the external pressure. If a large number of disc cartridges contained in the sleeve 
casings are stored in a stacked state, the sleeve casings tend to 
be easily deformed under the weight of the disc cartridges. The 
result is that the disc cartridges contained in the sleeve casings 
are fractured or deformed, as in the above case of application of 
the external pressure. Since the disc cartridge contained in the sleeve casing is 
maintained in the housed position under the force of friction 
between it and the inner lateral surface of the sleeve casing, it 
may occur that the disc cartridge be detached under vibrations or 
shocks from the sleeve casing and destroyed on descent upon the 
floor surface or the like. With the sleeve casing formed by 
bending the sheet material, it is difficult to provide for a free 
shape of the aperture via which the disc cartridge is inserted into 
the sleeve casing, with the result that it becomes difficult or  
 
laborious to introduce or detach the disc
