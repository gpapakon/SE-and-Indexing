<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses an improved electron 
gun for a color picture tube. 
The gun according to present invention comprises 
the first rim electrode having a beam passing plane 

with holes in the incident side of the electron beam; 
and the second rim electrode facing the first rim 

electrode and having another beam passing plane with 
holes in the departing side of the beam. According to 

the present invention, astigmatism formed between 
electrodes can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron gun for 
a color picture tube, and particularly to an in-line type 
gun improved in electrodes forming the main lens. An electron gun is mounted in the neck of the tube 
to emit thermion, and comprises a triple electrodes part 
having a cathode as a source of thermion, and a 
plurality of electrodes for forming electromagnetic lens 
by potential differences. In an in-line type electron gun, three electron beam 
passing holes are formed in line at two facing sides of 
two adjacent electrodes, and respectively prescribed 
voltages are applied to each electrodes to form a 
plurality of equipotential lines, namely the 
electromagnetic lens, thus the electron beam passing 
therethrough is focused and accelerated. The 
magnification of the electromagnetic lens formed  
 
between two electrodes, depends upon the size of beam 
passing holes and the potential difference between 
voltages applied to each electrodes, and the spherical 
aberration is increased with increasing magnification. Therefore, the magnification of the lens is 
conventionally reduced and the diameter of the lens is 
enlarged to reduce the spherical aberration of the 
electromagnetic lens formed between electrodes. In FIG. 1, there is shown an example of a couple of 
electrodes of the main lens for reducing the spherical 
aberration. The system comprises a couple of rim electrode 
components 11, 21 each of which having large 
apertured beam passing holes 11H, 21H, three beams 
concurrently passing therethrough; and plate electrode 
components 12, 22 placed independently in rim electrode 
components 11, 21 to be spaced by prescribed distance 
from large apertured beam passing holes 11H, 21H, 
having three vertically elongated beam passing 
holes (12R, 12G, 12B), (22R, 22G, 22B). When 
prescribed voltages applied to electrodes, electromagnetic 
lens as are formed between two electrodes 10, 20, and 
the lens comprises a large apertured lens formed 
between large apertured beam passing holes 11H, 21H 
of rim electrode components 11, 21 and small apertured 
lenses formed between each of small apertured beam  
 
passing holes(12R, 12G, 12B), (22R, 22G, 22B). The 
electron beam passing the lens suffers a converging 
force in which the vertical component is stronger than 
the horizontal component by the large apertured lens 
formed between rim electrode components 11 of oval 
shape, to result in a positive astigmatism. The positive astigmatism is compensated by 
negative astigmatism by small apertured
