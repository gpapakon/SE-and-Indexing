<CLAIMS>
Use of a binder system based on a resol with a free aldehyde content of less than 1%
and 0.5 to 10 % by weigth, relative to the resol, of a salt of a compound, which can

react with a carbonyl group, for producing compounds for reaction-injection-moulding
processes.
Use of a binder system based on a resol with a free aldehyde content of less than 1%
and 0.5 to 10 % by weigth, relative to the resol, of a salt of a compound, which can

react with a carbonyl group, for producing prepregs.
Use of a binder system based on a resol with a free aldehyde content of less than 1%

and 0.5 to 10 % by weigth, relative to the resol, of a salt of a compound, which can
react with a carbonyl group, for producing friction materials.
