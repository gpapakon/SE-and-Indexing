<ABSTRACT>
Containers (10) for cutlery (28-31), real and artificial jewelry generally, treated with chemical preparations whose action is antibacterial, antimycotic, and antiseptic in general, said treatment being given on the various component parts (11-21, 25) forming the structure coverings and linings as well as on the raw or semi-processed materials used in production of the individual components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The purpose of containers for cutlery, real and artificial 
jewelry and the like is to preserve and protect the contents 
and to make the most of their appearance and function when 
brought into use. Similarly well known as the above are the risks of new types 
of contagious and infectious diseases whose seriousness has 
only lately become known and adequately evaluated. Bearing in mind the nature of the objects preserved as above 
and the frequent handling they receive, it is clear that 
they can be easily infected and also infect people. Purpose of the above invention is to render impossible or at 
least greatly reduce this risk of contagion or infection.  
 Subject of the invention is a container as defined in 
claim 1. A container having the features of the preamble of claim 
1 is known from US-A-4 930 635.  
 The chemical treatment is given to the various components 
of the containers, both structural and coverings or linings, 
therefore consisting, as the case may be, of cloth, fabric 
or non-fabric, paper, cardboard, with parts of 
plastic material or some other kind. The treatment may be also given to accessories for holding the 
contents in place, which accessories may be of fabric, plastic 
materials, metals etcetera. Chemical treatment may further be applied to the raw or semiprocessed 
materials used to make components such as the 
thread for creating structural divisions or suchlike. Chemical treatment may be carried out on the containers 
themselves either during the course of production or when 
they are completed. Such treatment can be effected by spraying or by immersion 
or in some other way. One type of container is of a soft structure and is divided 
into compartments for receiving cutlery. Said compartments may be formed by superimposing layers of cloth 
sewn together by longitudinal parallel stitching. Further parallel rows of stitching may form single compartments. At the righthand edge of the container, of length equivalent 
to that of the pieces of cutlery, is a flap of material. Two matching strips of touch and close type fastener material are attached to 
said flap and to the lefthand edge of the container. Thus, by folding the upper flap over the compartments, then 
the left of the container over the right, longitudinally,  
 
and then the closing flap over the back of the folded left 
side, the two strips of fastener will match up and close the 
container as if it were a book. The compartments of the container here described are preferably 
arranged in two or more
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Container of a soft type (10) especially for cutlery 
(28-31), made of cloth (11-14) for the front, internal 

back covering, intermediate layers and linings, strips 
of touch and close type fasteners (25, 26) for closure, 

stitched seams (16-20), and comprising pockets, 
cavities, various compartments for holding, preserving, 

protecting and exhibiting the objects (28-31), there 
being on the right-hand edge of the container a closing 

flap (21), there being two strips (25, 26) of touch and close 
type fastener placed longitudinally on said flap and on 

the left-hand back edge of the container
 
characterized in that it possesses a structure with 

pocket compartments of which there may be two or more 
superimposed sets, the pieces of cloth for the front 

(14), the back (11) and for the intermediate layers (12, 
13) being joined by longitudinal and parallel seams (16-20), 

to form parallel pockets one next another, the 
upper edge of the piece of cloth for the back forming an 

upper flap, so that by folding the upper flap (27) of 
the back piece of cloth (11) onto the pockets, the left-hand 

side of the container onto its right-hand side and 
the back flap onto said left-hand side of the container, 

reciprocal matching of the fastener strips will close the 
container firmly in the form of a book and at least all 

those parts in contact with the objects contained and 
all parts forming cavities, holes, remote areas, all 

crevices favouring formation and proliferation of 
bacteria, possess antibacterial and antifungus  

 
properties as part of the fight against infection 

generally, said properties having been conferred by 
previous chemical treatment. 
Container (10) as in claim 1
 
characterized in that the front piece of cloth (14) is 

about half as long as the intermediate pieces (12, 13) 
while the back piece (11) is about twice the length of 

said intermediate pieces so as to permit the upper flap 
(27) to be folded onto the cutlery (28-31) placed in 

the pockets. 
Container as in claim 1
 
characterized in that the or each set includes four 

compartments and in that these compartments are of the 
same width. 
A method of producing the container of claim 1 
including the steps of providing the upper flap on the 

piece of cloth for the back and sewing the parallel 
seams to form the pockets, the treatment being given to 

the container. 
A method according to claim 4 wherein the treatment 
is carried out by sprayng. 
A method according to claim 4 or 5 but wherein the 
treatment is carried out on the various component parts 

of the container. 
A method according to claim 6 wherein the treatment 
is carried out on the raw materials or on the semifinished 

materials used to form the various component 
parts.
