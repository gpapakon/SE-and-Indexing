<ABSTRACT>
A radiographic phosphor panel having binder 
compatible oxosulfur stabilizer. The phosphor panel 

has a support and a luminescent layer overlaying the 
support. The luminescent layer includes phosphor 

crystals, binder and an oxosulfur reducing agent. The 
oxosulfur reducing agent is dispersed within the 

luminescent layer on a substantially molecular basis. 
The oxosulfur reducing agent is a reducing agent for 

iodine. The oxosulfur reducing agent has a 
concentration sufficient to substantially increase the 

photostimulated luminescence of the panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to radiographic
phosphor panels and more particularly relates to image
storage panels and prompt emission panels having binder
compatible oxosulfur stabilizing agent.A radiographic phosphor panel contains a
layer of phosphor, a crystalline material which
responds to X-radiation on an image-wise basis. Like
many other crystalline materials, radiographic
phosphors have a crystal matrix which allows for the
replacement of some atoms by other similar atoms, but
does not readily accept other atoms or moieties.
Radiographic phosphor panels can be classified, based
upon their phosphors, as prompt emission panels and
image storage panels.Intensifying screens are the most common
prompt emission panels. Intensifying panels are used
to generate visible light upon exposure of the
intensifying panel to X-radiation. A sheet of
photographic film is positioned to intercept the
visible light generated and commonly is pressed against
the intensifying panel within a light-tight cassette.
Other prompt emission panels operate similarly, but in
place of the photographic film have some other means
for visualizing the X-radiation.Storage panels have storage phosphors, that
have the capability of storing latent X-ray images for
later release, apparently by locally trapping electron-hole
pairs created by incident X-rays. Storage
phosphors are distinguishable from the phosphors used
in X-ray intensifying or conventional screens. In the
latter, a latent image is not stored and X-radiation
causes the immediate release of visible light from
irradiated phosphor crystals. Radiation image storage panels are used in
computed radiography. The panel is first exposed to X-radiation
to create a latent image. The panel is then
stimulated with longer wavelength radiation, resulting
in the emission of radiation at a third wavelength.
Typically a laser having a red or infrared beam is
scanned over the panel, resulting in the emission of
green or blue radiation. The emitted light is
collected and the resulting signal is processed
electronically to produce a final image.Degradation of final images due to panel
discoloration has long been recognized for intensifying
screens. There has not, however, been agreement as to
the source of that discoloration. What has been
noticed is that screens subject to prolonged exposure
to photographic film have tended to become discolored.
US-A-4,374,905 and US-A-4,360,571 state that the
discoloration is due to "volatile organic constituents
escaping from the associated photographic film"
