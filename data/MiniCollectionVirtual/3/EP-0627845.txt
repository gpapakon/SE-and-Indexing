<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a color image processing apparatus 
and method through which it is possible to realize high-speed 

encoding processing of image data containing data 
indicative of blank spaces. When encoding processing is 

executed, a CPU sets data, which is added on as a blank 
space or margin, in a blank-value setting memory, and a 

digital signal processor (DSP) for encoding 
processing reads in the set value 

before the start of encoding processing, effects a 
transformation to color space to undergo encoding 

processing, and stores the resulting data in its own 
internal memory, whereby the data stored in the internal 

memory is used in encoding of blank areas to make 
possible high-speed encoding processing. 

The image data are divided into blocks of pixels. The compression 
encoding means comprises memory means for supplying the results of 

calculation from a first calculation means to a second calculation 
means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image processing
method and apparatus for encoding or decoding image
data. By way of example, the invention relates to an
image processing method and apparatus for application to
an image file or image communication apparatus.An international standard for compressing color
image data of a natural picture, which contains an
enormous amount of information, has been proposed in
recent years by the JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts
Group). The method according to this standard shall be
referred to as the JPEG coding method below. Though the
JPEG coding method is composed of a plurality of
systems, the most fundamental is a baseline system.Fig. 27 is a diagram illustrating the data
compression procedure of a baseline system.First, input image data read by an original reading
device such as a scanner is partitioned into blocks each
comprising 8 x 8 pixels, after which compression
processing is executed in block units. According to the
JPEG coding method, the image data that has been read in 
by the original reading device is not regulated with
respect to the color space to be encoded. Often,
however, color-space transformation processing is
executed as processing which precedes encoding. As for
the color space to undergo transformation, there is much
color space in which it is possible to execute encoding
processing highly efficiently. An example of such color
space is that comprising luminance signals and color
signals (YCbCr, YIQ, Lab, etc.).In a baseline system, the image data (image data of
the original color space or that which results from
transformation of the color space) in each block
resulting from partitioning is subjected to a discrete
cosine transform (hereinafter referred to as "DCT"),
which is one type of orthogonal transform (1301). After
the original input image data has been transformed to
data of space frequency components by DCT, the
coefficient at the upper left corner of the 8 x 8 block
is referred to as a direct current (DC) component and is
a value corresponding to the mean value of the image
data of the block before transformation. The other 63
coefficients are referred to as alternating current (AC)
components. These are values indicating how many space
frequency components corresponding to these positions
are contained in the image data of a block before
transformation. DCT coefficients after transformation are divided
by values obtained by multiplying 8 × 8 threshold values
by scale factors for deciding which values, which are a
certain multiple of the
