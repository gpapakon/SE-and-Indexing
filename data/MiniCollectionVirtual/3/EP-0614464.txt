<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
treatment.Rheumatoid arthritis, (RA), has been described as an
unresolved systemic inflammation in which immune dysfunction and
genetic susceptibility play roles. There is increasing evidence
that the major immunopathological factor in RA is the covalently
linked complex between serum IgA and α1-antitrypsin (α1AT), a
major anti-protease. This disulphide-bridged complex is found
to be present at abnormally high levels in the sera and joint
fluids of RA patients. In vitro studies have revealed that the
complex is capable of inducing the release of tissue-degradative
enzymes from mouse macrophages, whilst injection of the complex
itself into the knee joints of rabbits or mice causes the onset
of RA like arthritis.It has been shown that a fall in the circulating level of
the complex is observed in those rheumatoid patients who respond
favourably to treatment with so-called "second-line"
anti-rheumatic drugs such as D-penicillamine (dimethyl cysteine)
and myocrisin (sodium aurothiomalate). This can be explained by
these thiol compounds forming mixed disulphides with the
thiol-active IgA produced in large amounts by rheumatoid
patients, thereby preventing its reaction with α1-antitrypsin to
form the undesired IgA-α1AT complex (Stanworth, D. R.
Immunology Today 1985, 6, 43) .There is a problem with the currently available thiol-based
anti-rheumatic drugs such as D-penicillamine in that they are
relatively toxic, causing many rheumatoid patients to end their
treatment prematurely.It is therefore desirable to find alternative means of
combatting rheumatoid arthritis. WO 90/12806 (Neosystem S.A.) discloses certain immunogenic
synthetic peptides which are formed as a conjugate of (i)
a sequence which is a fraction of the sequence of
ubiquintine (e.g. Gly-Gly-Arg-Leu) and (ii) a sequence
which is a fraction of the sequence of histone H2A (e.g.
Lys-Lys-Thr-Glu). These branched chain amino acid
conjugates may induce antibody production and may be
useful in diagnosis or treatment of autoimmune disease.Galpin et al in Tetrahedron Vol. 37, No. 17, 3025-3029 discloses
a fragment of lysozyme analogue (compound 121) having the
sequence including Cys-Ala-Lys-Lys-Ile. RA patients are known to produce grossly elevated levels of
thiol-reactive IgA which is thought to be covalently bonded to
α1AT to form the IgA-α1AT complex. It has now been found that
certain peptides, fulfilling certain specified requirements as
to their charged amino acid groups and capable of
