<ABSTRACT>
A device for discharging the walls (23, 24, 28, 30) of a plastic booth (20), in which workpieces are coated by means of a powder spraying device, voltage being applied to the powder in the powder spraying device and the workpiece being earthed, is distinguished by the fact that an earthed metal rack (2) can be introduced into the plastic booth, which rack has point electrodes (5) pointing outwards towards the inner walls (23, 24, 28, 30) of the plastic booth (20).

Device for discharging the walls (23, 24, 28,
30) of a plastic booth (20), in which workpieces can be

coated by means of a powder spraying device, whereby
the powder in the powder spraying device is charged and

the workpiece is earthed, characterized by an earthed
metal stand (2) to be introduced into the plastic booth

(20) with point electrodes (5) pointing outwardly
towards the walls (23, 24, 28, 30) of the plastic

booth.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the workpieces are moved by means of an earthed

conveying device (12) through the plastic booth and in
that the metal stand (2) has hooks (10) for hanging up

on the conveying device (12) and for transportation by
it.
Device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the metal stand (2) is formed by

two parallel perforated plates (4) which are connected
to each other, from the perimeters of which plates the

point electrodes (5) project away towards all sides.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in
that the point electrodes (5) are arranged in the

planes of the perforated plates (4).
Device according to claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that each perforated plate (4) has a

hanger (8) for hanging up the stand on a conveying
device (12).
Method for the electrical discharging of the
walls (23, 24, 28, 30) of a plastic booth (20), in

which workpieces are moved by a conveyor (12) through
the booth (20) and in the process are electrostatically

coated by means of a powder spraying device, whereby
the powder in the powder spraying device is charged and

the workpiece is earthed, characterized in that in each
case after a coating cycle, in place of workpieces a 

metal stand (2) provided with point electrodes (5) is
conveyed through the plastic booth (20), whereby the

point electrodes (5) are directed towards the walls
(23, 24, 28, 30) of the plastic booth (20) which are to

be discharged and the powder spraying device is

stopped.
