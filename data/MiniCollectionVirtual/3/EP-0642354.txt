 DescriptionMETHODS FOR DETECTING AND ISOLATING uPA-R AND INHIBITING THE BINDING OF UPA TO uPA-RBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to methods for detecting and isolating uPA-R utilizing monoclonal antibodies. The present invention also relates to methods for inhibiting the binding of uPA to uPA-R.Background ArtUro inase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is an enzyme responsible for the generation of the protease, plasmin. uPA is thought to be involved in the generation of extracellular proteolytic activity in physiological and pathological processes such as cell migration, tissue remodeling, and tumor invasion and metastasis (Adv. Cancer Res.. vol. 44, pp. 139266 (1985). The evidence that uPA plays a specific role in these processes includes the observation that uPA binds to a specific cellular receptor (uPA-R) on a wide variety of cell types of normal and malignant origin (J. Cell Biol.. vol. 100, pp. 86-96 (1985) ; Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.. vol. 82, pp. 4939-4943 (1985); and J. Biol. Chem. , vol. 263, pp. 2358-2363 (1988). uPA bound to this receptor, which has been characterized (J. Biol. Chem.. vol. 265, pp. 6453-6460 (1990); and EMBO J.. vol. 9, pp. 467-474 (1990)), has been shown to retain its proteolytic activity (J. Cell Biol.. vol. 100, pp. 86-92 (1985) ; Proc Nail. Acad, Sci, U.S.A., vol. 82, pp. 49394943 (1985); J. Biol. Chem.. vol. 264, pp. 2185-2188 (1989); and J. Cell Biol.. vol. 108, pp. 1987-1995 (1989)). Plasminogen is also able to bind to many cell types (J. Biol. Chem. , vol. 260, pp. 4303-4311 (1985)) and it has been demonstrated that the concomitant binding of uPA and plasminogen results in the generation of plasmin activity on the cell surface 

 (J. Biol. Chem.. vol. 264, pp. 2185-2188 (1989); and J. Cell Biol.. vol. 108, pp. 1987-1995 (1989)) and also that this system constitutes a mechanism for accelerating the activation of the pro-enzyme form of uPA (J. Biol. Chem. , vol. 264, pp. 2185-2188 (1989)) .Mo3 is a glycoprotein whose expression on human monocytes and myelomonocytic cell lines is induced by bacterial LPS and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) , as well as certain cytokines and pharmacologic agonists of protein kinase C and CAMP. Mo3 was originally identified as a onocyte surface antigen recognized by a panel of monoclonal antibodies that were generated against antigens selectively expressed on activated acrophages (J. Immunol.. vol. 135, p. 3869 (1985) ; Blood Cells, vol. 16, p. 167 (1990) ; and J. Immunol. , vol. 137, p. 448 (1986)). By im
