<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are disclosed for detecting and locating the origin of a gamma ray in a medical diagnostic imaging system. At least one primary fiber, which is a scintillating optical fiber (21) is positioned to receive radiation from a gamma ray source. At least one secondary fiber intersects the primary fiber at a non-zero angle. Both fibers have a core surrounded by a cladding (22, 23), with the claddings of the two fibers in optical contact at an intersection point (24). Both the primary and secondary fibers are provided with means for detecting light propagated in the fibers. The interaction of radiation such as a gamma ray with the primary fiber will result in the propagation of light in both the primary and secondary fibers, thereby permitting the determination of the site of impact of the gamma ray in the detector, and possibly also enabling the determination of the path of incidence of the gamma ray.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 784,593, filed on
October 29, 1991, now pending.This invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for locating the
origin of radiation, such as a gamma ray, in an imaging system. In particular, this
invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the origin of a gamma
ray as part of a technique of imaging internal organs in a living subject.There are many situations in medicine where it is desirable to obtain images
of a patient's internal organs or body functions. The imaging technology that is used
to do this includes a variety of techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT),
and positron emission tomography (PET).Generally speaking, in PET, a radionuclide is administered internally to a
living subject. A positron from the decaying radionuclide encounters and annihilates
with an electron, resulting in a pair of 511 keV annihilation photons which are
emitted in exactly opposite (180°) directions from the annihilation site in the subject.
By arranging banks of radiation detectors -- typically scintillation detectors -- all
around the subject, the origin of the gamma ray can be determined. Substantially
simultaneous detection of photons in opposingly situated detectors defines the site of 
the positron-electron annihilation as lying somewhere along a line directly between
the opposing detectors. Typical PET scanners or tomographs include complex
computerized data systems for collecting the information obtained and using it to
reconstruct an image of the target organ, using mathematical techniques similar to
those employed in computerized tomography.The radioactive isotopes used in PET include, but are not limited to, 18F,
which has a half-life of approximately 110 minutes, 11C (half-life of approximately
20 minutes), 13N (half-life of approximately 10 minutes), and 15O (half-life of
approximately 2 minutes). Because of the relatively short half-lives of the
radioisotopes used, they are typically produced in an on-site cyclotron or other
particle accelerator. Other nuclides exist which have either a long half life or a
parent with long half life. These can be used without on-site cyclotrons, but they
have generally less desirable chemical or physical characteristics. The practical need
for an on-site cyclotron dramatically increases the cost of PET and therefore has
limited the number of such systems in place.In contrast, in SPECT, a single
