<ABSTRACT>
A process for stabilising the spatial orientation of the smectic layers in an FLC switching and/or display component, in which the original geometry of the smectic layers was modified by electrical field processing, characterized in that the component is alternately switched during inoperational periods and/or when a given temperature is exceeded beyond a predetermined temperature range including the working temperature range, and/or on going below a given temperature lying below a predetermined temperature range which includes the working temperature range. The use of the process of the invention ensures the continuous operation of the switching and display device even with the repeated regeneration of the "quasi bookshelf geometry" and prevents a reduction in contrast and brightness and the appearance of ghost images.

A process for the stabilization of the spatial 
alignment of the smectic layers in the display plane 

(display) in an FLC switching and/or display element 
in which an original chevron geometry of the smectic 

layers has been converted into a quasi-bookshelf 
geometry by electrical field treatment, wherein 


a) a critical temperature is determined which is 
defined in such a way that the cumulative effect 

of the tilt of the smectic layers in the display 
plane achieves a certain tolerance value at a 

defined number of heating cycles at which this 
temperature is in each case achieved, this 

tolerance value being determined from the impairment 
in contrast and brightness and the occurrence 

of ghost images caused by the tilting of 
the layers; and/or a critical temperature is 

determined in such a way that the cumulative 
effect of the tilting of the smectic layers in 

the display plane achieves a certain tolerance 
value at a defined number of cooling cycles at 

which this temperature is in each case achieved, 
this tolerance value being determined from the 

impairment in contrast and brightness and the 
occurrence of ghost images caused by the tilting 

of the layers; 
b) the display is provided with a permanent power 
supply;  

 
c) the display is provided with a sensor which 
determines the temperature of the display; 
d) on reaching the critical temperature or temperatures, 
the liquid crystal is switched 

alternately, 
 
and/or wherein 


e) the display is provided with a permanent power 
supply and 
f) in the switched-off state of the display, the 
liquid crystal is switched alternately, without 

restricting the temperature, at a frequency of 
from one switch per day to the maximum switching 

frequency of the liquid crystal. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
switching state is changed at most once each time 

the temperature again exceeds the critical 
temperature. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 and/or 2, wherein 
the frequency of the switching states formed is 

weighted. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
switching states are always changed again above 

and/or below the critical temperature(s). 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the switching and/or display element is 

only switched alternately in the case of rising 
temperature after the critical temperature is 

exceeded and only in the temperature range of the 
S
c
* phase.  
 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the switching and/or display element is 

only switched alternately in the case of falling 
temperature after the temperature falls below the 

critical temperature. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein, in the switched-on state of the 

switching and/or display device, the liquid crystal 
is switched alternately, without restriction of the 

temperature, at a frequency of from one switch per 
day to the maximum switching frequency of the liquid 

crystal. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
7, wherein the signals for the switching of the 

liquid crystal have pause periods between pulses of 
opposite polarity. 
A device for stabilizing the spatial alignment of 
the smectic layers in the display plane (display) in 

an FLC switching and/or display element in which an 
original chevron geometry of the smectic layers has 

been converted into a quasi-bookshelf geometry by 
electrical field treatment, by a process as claimed 

in one or more of claims 1 to 8, which device 
contains 


a) a permanent power supply, 
b) driver ICs, 
c) at least one temperature sensor which compares 
the temperature of the display with the critical 

temperature(s), 
d) at least one control element which converts 
information on temperature and/or operation/non-operation 

of the display and/or switching states  
 

and any stored values of a calibration curve and 
previous history of the display into the corresponding 

switching change states, 
 
and, if desired,
 
e) a memory. 
An FLC switching and/or display element containing 
a device as claimed in claim 9.
