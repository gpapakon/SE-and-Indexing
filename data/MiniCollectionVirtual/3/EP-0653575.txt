<ABSTRACT>
A tapered roller thrust bearing assembly with 
an internal seal. The seal is affixed to the inner surface 

of the closure cup and is totally enclosed thereby. A 
flexible flange portion on the seal prevents entry of debris 

into the bearing assembly, yet permits grease to exit the 
assembly. Because it is totally contained within the closure 

cup, the seal is protected from injury and wear. Moreover, 
production of the bearing assembly is simplified.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to bearing
assemblies and, more particularly, to tapered roller thrust
bearings with internal seals. A bearing assembly of this type
is disclosed in French Patent Number 70.21529 owned by SKF
Kugellagerfabriken G.M.B.H. This patent discloses a bearing
assembly with two races that surround rollers and are held in
place by a cap. The cap is spaced from one of the races to
allow the exit of old grease from the assembly during a
regreasing operation. Below the underside of the cap and
between the two races is an L frame which supports a seal.
The seal has annular surfaces inclined with respect to the
axis of the bearing. The L frame and seal combination is
intended to allow old grease to exit through the space created
between the cap and one race. Bearings of this nature are
complicated to assemble and depend upon pressure on the seal
for the seal to remain in a fixed position. If this manner of
holding the seal in place fails, the seal and frame could move
in such a way as to block the exit path of the old grease.One embodiment of this invention may be summarized
as: a thrust bearing assembly comprising:
a first annular race having a peripheral surface, an
upper surface, an inner surface which partially defines a
central bore, and a lower surface which partially defines a
roller receiving recess;a second annular race having a peripheral surface, an
upper surface which is spaced a distance from the lower
surface of the first annular race to form an annular chamber
therebetween and which partially defines a roller receiving
recess, a lower surface, and an inner surface which partially
defines a central bore;a plurality of rollers positioned between the first and
second annular races in the roller receiving recess;a closure cup for containing the first and second races
and the rollers in operative relationship, wherein the closure
cup has a top wall which encloses the upper surface of the
first annular race and a side wall extending down from the top
wall which side wall encloses the peripheral surfaces of the
first and second annular races, wherein the side wall of the
closure cup has a first portion which encloses the peripheral 
surface of the first race, a lip portion which encloses
the peripheral surface of the second race and is spaced a
distance therefrom to form an annular space continuous
with the annular chamber, and a central portion between
the first portion and the lip portion enclosing the
annular chamber; andan annular seal having a flexible flange with a

A thrust bearing assembly (10) comprising:

a first annular race (12) having a peripheral surface (32), an upper surface (20),
an inner surface (26) which partially defines a central bore (30), and a lower surface

(22) which partially defines a roller receiving recess (24);
a second annular race (14) having a peripheral surface (48), an upper surface
(40) which is spaced a distance from the lower surface (22) of the first annular race

(12) to form an annular chamber (54) therebetween and which partially defines a roller
receiving recess (42), a lower surface (44), and an inner surface (46) which partially

defines the central bore (30);
a plurality of rollers (16) positioned between the first and second annular races
(12, 14) in the roller receiving recess (24,42);
a closure cup (18) for containing the first and second races (12, 14) and the
rollers (16) in operative relationship, wherein the closure cup (18) has a top wall (56)

which encloses the upper surface (20) of the first annular race (12) and a side wall (58)
extending down from the top wall (56) which side wall (58) encloses the peripheral

surfaces (32, 48) of the first and second annular races (12, 14), wherein the side wall
(58) of the closure cup (18) has a first portion (60) which encloses the peripheral surface

(32) of the first race (12), a lip portion (62) which encloses the peripheral surface (48)
of the second race (14) and is spaced a distance therefrom to form an annular space

(64) continuous with the annular chamber (54), and a central portion (66) between the
first portion (60) and the lip portion (62) enclosing the annular chamber (54); and
an annular seal (70) having a flexible flange (78)
with a tip that contacts the upper surface (40) of the second annular race (14) so as to

divide the annular space (64) and the annular chamber (54), whereby entry of debris
through the annular space (64) into the bearing assembly (10) is prevented and

whereby escape of grease from inside the bearing assembly (10) through the annular
space (64) is permitted, 
the assembly (10) being characterized in that:

the annular seal (70) is attached to the inner surface (68) of the central portion (66) of
the side walls (58) of the closure cup (18), in that the external diameter of the second annular race (14) is

greater than the external diameter of the first annular race (12), in that a shelf portion (52)

extends radially beyond the periphery of the first annular race (12), and in that the central
portion (66) of the side wall (58) of the closure cup (18) has a diameter greater than

the diameter of the first portion (60) of the closure cup (18).
The thrust bearing assembly (10) of claim 1 
further characterized in that
 the
rollers (16) are tapered.
The thrust bearing assembly (10) of claim 1 or 2 
further characterized in that
 the
external diameter of the second annular race (14) is greater than the external diameter

of the first annular race (12) to provide an annular shelf portion (52) on the second
annular race (14) which extends radially beyond the periphery of the first annular race

(12),the flexible flange (78) of the seal (70) extending from the seal (70) a distance
from the inner surface (68) of the central portion (66) and being directed at an acute

angle toward the side wall (58) of the closure cup (18).
The thrust bearing assembly (10) of claim 1, 2 or 3 
further characterized in that

the peripheral surface (48) of the second annular race (14) defines in cross section an
upper straight portion and a lower inwardly sloping shoulder portion (50) and wherein

the lip portion (62) of the side wall (58) of the closure cup (18) generally conforms to
the upper straight portion and the lower shoulder portion (50), whereby the closure cup (18)

retains the first and second annular races (12, 14) and the rollers (16) in operative
position.
