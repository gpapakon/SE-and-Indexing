<ABSTRACT>
On an optical disk, information is recorded on both 
grooves and lands as guide tracks for guiding a light 

beam. The width of each groove and that of each land are 
set substantially equal to each other. A plurality of 

series of pits representing address information are formed 
in the grooves so that the series of pits in a groove and 

the series of pits in the adjacent grooves are located in 
different radial directions of the optical disk. Address 

pits are not formed in any of the tracks formed by the 
lands. When the light beam scans the track on the land, 

the address information is obtained by crosstalk of the 
series of address pits formed in the track on the groove. 

This structure enables the management of the addresses of 
tracks having thereon no address pits. When obtaining the 

address information by reproducing the series of address 
pits on the groove, since no crosstalk occurs, accurate 

address information is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical disks such
as magneto-optical disks on which address information is
prerecorded as a series of pits, and a method for
reproducing the address information.Research and development on magneto-optical disks as
rewritable optical disks are being carried out actively,
and some magneto-optical disks have been practically used
as external memory for computers.A magneto-optical disk uses a layer having a
perpendicular magnetization as a recording medium, and
records and reproduces information using light. The 
magneto-optical disk having such structures has an
increased recording capacity compared with a floppy disk
and a hard disk which use a layer having an in-plane
magnetization.As illustrated in Fig. 12, a magneto-optical disk is
provided with grooves 51 so that a light spot 55
accurately follows a land 52 formed between the grooves
51. Address information is recorded in the form of pits
53 on each of the lands 52 so that the address information
of a track being scanned by the light spot 55 is obtained.Information is recorded on and reproduced from tracks
as lands 52. The track pitch is almost equal to the
diameter of the light spot 55 which varies depending on
the wavelength of laser light and the numerical aperture
of an objective lens. The objective lens converges the
laser light into the light spot 55. Usually, the
wavelength of the laser light is between 780 nm and 830 nm
and the numerical aperture of the objective lens is
between 0.45 and 0.6. Thus, the diameter of the light
spot 55 is set between 1.2 µm and 1.4 µm and the track
pitch is set between 1.4 µm and 1.6 µm. Accordingly, the
minimum diameter of an upwardly or downwardly magnetized
recording domain 54 is around 0.8 µm.A magneto-optical disk having flat mirrored sections
62 shown in Fig. 13 is also well known. Although pits 63 
are formed in the mirrored sections 62, the mirrored
sections 62 do not have grooves 61. The light spot 55
tracks the grooves 61, and the address information of a
track being scanned by the light spot 55 is obtained by
reproducing the pits 63. Similarly to the above-mentioned
optical disk of Fig. 12, the minimum diameter of a
recording domain 64 on the groove 61 of this
magneto-optical disk is around 0.8 µm.In recent years, some methods have been proposed to
increase the recording density of a magneto optical disk
by using a recording film composed of magnetic layers and
reproducing a recording bit of a size much smaller than
the size of the light spot 55 by magnetically induced
s
