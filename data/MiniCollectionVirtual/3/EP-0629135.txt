<ABSTRACT>
The invention involves the use of supercritical or near-critical fluids for the inactivation of viruses, especially enveloped or lipid protected viruses, viral-like particles and other pathogens in any matrix, but preferably in solutions containing biologically active proteinaceous products of natural or genetic engineering origin or in semi-solid or solid support matrices which are thermally labile or sensitive to conventional viral inactivation techniques. Novel apparatus also are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for the inactivation of
viruses.Infectious viruses, unless inactivated, can be
readily transmitted from biological products derived
from human plasma as well as recombinant-DNA and
monoclonal antibody sources. The hepatitis B virus
(HBV) as well as the agents of non-A and non-B
hepatitis (NANBHV) have plagued patients, physicians
and manufacturers for many years. In recent years,
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -- the
etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) -- has become a very serious and epidemic
problem. In several instances, coagulation factor
concentrates have transmitted HIV to hemophiliacs,
some of whom have subsequently developed AIDS (an
estimated 65 % of the 20,000 hemophiliacs in the
United States are infected with HIV, Wall Street
Journal, 27th December 1990. Morgenthaler, a leading researcher
in this field, states in his preface to Viral Inactivation in
Plasma Products in Clinical Studies in Hematology and Blood
Transfusion, Edited by A. Hassig et al, Karger, New York (1989)
that: "Clearly, there is a need for methods that inactivate
viruses in blood, without causing harm to the components intended
for therapeutic use." Viral inactivation of recombinant-DNA products is
still a major and active concern for the biotechnology
and pharmaceutical industries as well as the
regulatory agencies. The FDA in Points to Consider
in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody
Products for Human Use states that: "It is strongly
recommended that validated procedures ... which
remove and/or inactivate viruses and DNA if present be
employed during purification..." For reasons of
safety and public health, the quest is to discover and
develop processes for inactivating viruses without
denaturing the biologically active products which are
commonly labile and quite sensitive to conventional
viral inactivation techniques.A number of approaches have been employed for the
inactivation of viruses in therapeutic proteins
derived from human plasma and other biologically
active raw materials. Some of these approaches
include: heating or pasteurization; chemical
inactivation agents; ultraviolet (UV) and gamma
irradiation; solvent extraction of essential lipids;
neutralization with specific antibodies; and removal
by various fractionation techniques.Several heat treatment methods have been invented
to inactivate viruses without adversely affecting the
biological activity of particular proteins. Most of
these methods require the use of stabilizers to

A method of rendering a virus associated with a material
inactive characterized in comprising the steps of:


a) contacting the material with a critical or near critical
fluid at a pressure of at least 1000 psig (a gauge pressure of

6.89x10
6
N/m
2
), more preferably about 3000 psig (a gauge pressure
of 2.068x10
7
N/m
2
), said critical or near critical fluid being
capable of being received by said virus and being such that, upon

removal of the critical or near critical fluid, said virus is
inactivated; and
b) removing said critical or near critical fluid from said

material and said virus.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said material is
a biological material.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said material is
a liquid, and said contacting step comprises forming an admixture

of critical or near critical fluid and said material.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said material
comprises a biological substance selected from proteins, nucleic

acid, and biologically active small molecules.
A method according to Claim 4, further comprising the
step of isolating said biological substance.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said critical or
near critical fluid is selected from one or more of

fluorocarbons, alkanes and binary fluids.
A method according to Claim 6, wherein said critical or
near critical fluid is selected from chlorodifluoromethane and

trifluoromethane. 
A method according to Claim 6, wherein said critical or
near critical fluid is selected from one or more of ethylene,

propane and ethane.
A method according to Claim 6, wherein said critical or
near critical fluid is selected from one or more of nitrous

oxide, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said critical
or near critical fluid has a temperature in the range of

approximately 0째C to 100째C.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said critical
or near critical fluid has a temperature in the range of

approximately 4째C to 40째C.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said critical
or near critical fluid has a reduced pressure (Pr) having a

relationship with the operating pressure and the critical
pressure as defined by the equation:


Pr = 
Po
Pc
 = X

wherein X is a number in the range of 0.2 to 20.0;

Pr is the reduced pressure;
Po is the operating pressure; and
Pc is the critical pressure.
A method according to Claim 12, wherein X is a number
