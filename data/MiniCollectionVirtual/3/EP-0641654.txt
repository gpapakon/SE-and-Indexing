<ABSTRACT>
A liquid jet recording method includes 
applying thermal energy to liquid in a liquid passage 

to produce film boiling of the liquid to produce a 
bubble; permitting the bubble to communicate with 

ambience; wherein the liquid passage is not blocked in 
the communicating step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording 
method and a recording apparatus having a process step 
by which a bubble produced by thermal energy 
communicates with ambience, more particularly to a 
recording method and apparatus such as a printer or 
recording images or characters on paper or cloth 
(recording material) in accordance with a recording 
signal, a copying machine, a facsimile machine having 
an information transmitting system, an electronic 
typewriter having a keyboard, a wordprocessor, or a 
compound system or the like. Among various recording methods which have 
been put into practice for various printers, an ink jet 
system as disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,723,129, 
4,740,796 or the like, which uses thermal energy to 
produce film boiling, is advantageous. In one of the 
types a liquid passage is not blocked by the bubble in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,410,899. The prior art is applicable to various 
recording systems, but they do not disclose or teach, 
to the practical level, the system wherein the created 
bubble communicates with the ambience. This system 
will be called "ambience communication system". As one type of the ambience communication  
 
system, there is a system in which the bubble 
explodes. However, since the liquid ejection is not 
stabilized, it is not practical. Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Application No. 161935/1979 discloses a 
cylindrical nozzle provided with internal cylindrical 
heater in which the nozzle is blocked by the bubble, 
although the ejection principle is not known, but it 
splashes a great number of fine ink droplets as well as 
the relatively large major droplet. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 
185455/1986 discloses that liquid ink is filled in a 
small clearance between a heat generating head and a 
plate member having small openings and is heated by the 
heat generating head to create a bubble to eject a 
droplet of the ink through the fine opening. Also, the 
gas forming the bubble is ejected through the fine 
opening. By doing so, an image is formed on a 
recording material. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 
249768/1986 discloses that a bubble is formed by 
application of thermal energy to liquid ink. By the 
expansion force of the bubble, a small droplet of the 
ink is formed and ejected. Simultaneously, the gas 
forming the bubble is ejected through a large opening 
into the atmosphere. By doing so, an image is formed 
on the recording material. The system of this publication 
is characterized by the absence of the wall.  

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for discharging liquid for recording, comprising 
the steps of: 


providing a liquid passage communicating with an ejection 
outlet with liquid, 
providing the liquid with heat generated by an ejection energy 
generating element, 
creating a bubble in the liquid by the heat so that liquid is 
ejected through the ejection outlet, wherein, when the liquid 

is ejected, the bubble communicates with the ambiance,
characterized in that
in the communicating step the bubble communicates with the 
ambiance under the condition that an internal pressure of the 

bubble is lower than the pressure of the ambience. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the liquid passage is 
not blocked when the bubble communicates with the ambiance. 
A liquid jet apparatus comprising a recording head having an 
ejection outlet for ejecting ink, a liquid passage 

communicating with the ejection outlet and an ejection energy 
generating element for generating thermal energy contributable 

to the ejection of the ink by creation of a bubble in the 
liquid passage, 
characterized by a
 driving circuit for 
supplying a signal to the ejection energy generating means so 

that in the communicating step the bubble communicates with the 
ambiance under the condition that an internal pressure of the 

bubble is lower than the pressure of the ambience, and a platen 
for supporting a recording material for reception of the liquid 

ejected.
