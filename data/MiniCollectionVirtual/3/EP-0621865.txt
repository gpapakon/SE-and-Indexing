<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel compound, to processes for its production, to
pharmaceutical formulations containing it, to its use in medical therapy, particularly
in the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections, and also to its use as an
immunosuppressant and in treating carcinogenic tumours.Rapamycin is a known compound and is a member of the triene class of antibiotics. It
was first isolated as an extract of the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and
reported to have antifungal activity (British Patent 1436447). Subsequently
rapamycin has been implicated as an immunosuppressant (Martel R.R. et al Can. J.
Physiol. Pharmacol. 55, 48-51, 1977).At least one rapamycin-producing strain of
Streptomyces hygroscopicus was deposited with the Northern Utilization and
Research Division, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Peoria , Illinois, U.S.A under accession number NRRL 5491. Rapamycin, and
methods for its preparation by culturing NRRL 5491 are disclosed by US patent
3,929,992 issued December 30 1975.EP-A-0 401 747 describes the use of rapamycin in a method of inhibiting organ or
tissue transplant rejection in mammals, either alone or in combination with one or
more chemotherapeutic agents.WO 91/02736 (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company Limited) and WO 91/13889
(Fisons plc) describe certain macrocyclic compounds, having a number of structural
characteristics in common with rapamycin, and the use of these compounds as
immunosuppressive agents.A large number of microorganisms have been found to produce a variety of
metabolites which have subsequently been isolated and have been shown to possess
useful therapeutic properties. One such compound is 14-methylene rapamycin. This
is believed to be a novel compound and has been found to have useful antifungal
activity, anticancer activity and also immunomodulatory properties.Accordingly, in first aspect the present invention provides a compound of formula (I): 

which is 14-methylene rapamycin (9-methylene rapamycin) having antifungal,
anticancer or immunomodulatory activity or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof.This novel compound has been found to have useful antimicrobial anticancer and
immunomodulatory activity.This compound is referred to as 14-methylene rapamycin according to the numbering
system of J.Findlay etal., Can. J. Chem. (1980) 58, 579,however according to the
more recent numbering system of J. Mc Alpine etal., J. Antibiotics (1991) 44, 688
this would be known as 9-methylene rapamycin.The effect of the
