<ABSTRACT>
A cardboard blank (1) for producing a folding box, having four side and end walls (2,3,4,5) which are connected to one another by fold lines (6,7,8), a bottom and a lid section (14,15;11,12) being linked in each case to two non-adjacent side walls (2,3) and two dust flaps (17,18,19,20) being linked in each case over fold lines (13,16) to the two end walls (4,5), and additionally a further wall section (10) being moulded onto the one side wall (2) to connect this side wall (2) to the adjacent end wall (5) in an articulated manner. Three intended tearing lines formed as perforation lines (21,22,23,51,52,53) are provided, two of which extend essentially parallel to the fold lines (6,7) between the side and end walls (2,3,4) over the two lid sections (11,12) and right into the upper region of the side walls (2,3) to which the lid sections are linked, and the third intended tearing line (21) connects the ends, lying in the side walls, of the other two intended tearing lines (22,23) to one another and extends over the end wall (4) lying between them. One fold line (24,25) in each case extends from the two intersections of the intended tearing lines (21,22,23) at an angle to the fold lines (6,7) which connect the respective side wall (2,3) to the end wall (4), whereas the ends of these two fold lines (24,25) are connected by a further fold line (26) which extends across the end wall (4), and further fold lines (27,28) extend at an angle from the said intersections of the intended tearing lines to the fold lines (13) between the side walls (2,3) and the lid sections (11,12) linked thereto, which fold lines then continue in the lid sections (11,12) and lie congruently there.

Board blank (1) for the production of a folding carton, with four side and end
panels (2, 3, 4, 5) connected to each other by folding lines (6, 7, 8), in which both

a base section (14, 15) and a top section (11, 12) are hinged to two side panels
(2, 3) that are not adjacent to each other and two dust flaps (17, 18, 19, 20) are

hinged to each of the two end panels (4, 5) - in each case along folding lines (13,
16) - and in which an additional panel section (10) is hinged to one of the side

panels (2) to connect this side panel (2) to the adjacent end panel (5), with several
tear lines provided preferably in the form of perforation lines
 (21, 22, 23), two of
which extend essentially parallel to the folding lines (6, 7) between the side and

end panels (2, 3, 4) across the two top sections (11, 12) and into the upper
section of the side panels (2, 3) to which the top sections are hinged, while the

third tear line (21) connects the ends of the two other tear lines (22, 23) located in
the side panels and extends across the end panel (4) between these side panels,

and in which a folding line (24, 25) extends obliquely from each of the
intersection points of the tear lines (21, 22, 23) to the folding lines (6, 7) that

connect the relevant side panel (2, 3) to the end panel (4), the ends of these two
folding lines (24, 25) are connected by another folding line (26) that extends

across the end panel (4) and further folding lines (27, 28) extend obliquely from
the above-mentioned intersection points of the tear lines to the folding lines (13)

between the side panels (2, 3) and the top sections (11, 12) hinged to them that
then continue in the top sections (11, 12) as folding lines (29, 30) and are then

positioned on top of each other when the board blank has been formed, 
wherein

the folding line (26) that connects the two oblique folding lines (24, 25) across
the end panel (4) is designed to extend in a curved shape, 
wherein
 the two 
folding lines (29, 30) that extend across the top sections (11, 12) are also

designed to be curved, 
wherein
 the middle section of the tear line (21) that
extends across the end panel (4) is provided in a higher position and 
wherein
 the
height of the dust flap (17) that is hinged to the end panel (4) provided with the

tear line (21) is smaller than the distance between the tear line (22, 23) in the top
sections (11, 12) and the line (13) hinging this dust flap (17) to the end panel (4).
