<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a reciprocating piston engine with a flywheel (2) arranged on the crankshaft (1) to reduce the non-uniformity of the torque, in which a second flywheel (3) is rotatably mounted on the crankshaft (1) and can be coupled to the flywheel (2) by means of a friction clutch (4). The clutch (4) is operated by means of an actuator (5) controlled by a control device (7) which processes signals from sensors (8 to 12). During steady-state operation of the engine in the low engine speed range, the second flywheel (3) will be engaged. During acceleration and in the range of high engine speeds, the second flywheel (3) is decoupled. The engine thus turns over uniformly at low speeds. However, it is more lively in acceleration than a comparable conventional engine and has a better braking effect. After braking during operation in a vehicle, part of the kinetic energy of the flywheel (3) can be used to accelerate the vehicle.

Reciprocating-piston engine with a flywheel mass 
arranged on the crankshaft of the crank drive to reduce the 

degree of unevenness of torque output, wherein the moment 
of inertia of the crank drive is minimised to non-steady 

operation, an additional flywheel mass can be connected 
controllably to the crank drive (crankshaft 1, flywheel 2), 

the additional flywheel mass is mounted freely rotatably on 
the crankshaft (1) and can be connected to the crankshaft 

(1) by a clutch (4), the clutch (4) is a friction clutch 
which is operated via an actuator (5) as a function of 

signals from sensors for detecting engine parameters, 
characterised in that the additional flywheel mass consists 

of several flywheels which can be connected to the crank 
drive. 
Reciprocating-piston engine according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the additional flywheels (3) are 

mounted freely rotatably on the crankshaft (1) and can be 
connected to the crankshaft (1) by a clutch (4). 
Reciprocating-piston engine according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the clutch (4) is a friction clutc
