<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for simulating living tissue which is to be monitored by a pulse oximeter that provides red and infrared light flashes. The red and infrared light flashes of the pulse oximeter are converted into electrical signals by photodiodes (10), converted electrical signals are modulated to provide modulated electrical signals and the modulated electrical signals are converted to light flashes provided by an LED bar (16). The light flashes are transmitted to the pulse oximeter for detection so that the pulse oximeter responds to the converted light flashes as it would to light flashes modulated by a living tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the
field of pulse oximeters, and more particularly,
relates to a device and method for testing or
calibrating pulse oximeters.The non-invasive monitoring of arterial oxygen
saturation (SaO2) by pulse oximetry is used in many
clinical applications. For example, SaO2 monitoring is
performed during surgery, in critical care situations,
for hypoxemia screening, in the emergency room, and in
the field. The instruments are small and lightweight,
making them ideal for neonatal, pediatric and
ambulatory applications. Because this instrument is
capable of providing continuous and safe measurements
of blood oxygenation non-invasively, the pulse
oximeter is widely recognized as one of the most
important technological advances in bedside
monitoring. In 1986, the American Society of
Anesthesiologists recommended pulse oximetry as a
standard of care for basic intraoperative monitoring,
and in 1988, the Society for Critical Care Medicine
recommended that this method be used for monitoring
patients undergoing oxygen therapy. The mandatory or 
voluntary use of pulse oximetry by regulatory agencies
and professional organizations is likely to continue.Because pulse oximeters are small, easy-to-use
and readily available, they have become widespread in
the last decade. The high costs associated with
health care make the use of non-invasive pulse
oximetry very attractive as it permits effective
oxygen monitoring without the expensive clinical
laboratory analysis of blood samples.Oxygen saturation measurements rely on the
difference in optical absorbance of deoxyhemoglobin
(Hb) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), as shown in Figure 1.
HbO2 absorbs less light in the red region (ca. 660 nm)
than does Hb, but absorbs more strongly in the
infrared region (ca. 940 nm). If both wavelengths of
light are used, their opposite change in light
absorbed as HbO2 varies versus Hb produces a sensitive
index of blood oxygen saturation. The "functional
hemoglobin saturation" is defined as:
Functional SaO2 = {[HbO2]/[HbO2 + Hb]} x 100%Pulse oximeters thus employ two discrete
wavelengths of light, which are passed through a given
tissue (typically a finger). The amount of
transmitted light for each wavelength is detected and 
subtracted from the incident light to determine the
amount absorbed. From the ratio (R/IR or
"red/infrared") of the amount of light absorbed at
each wavelength, the blood oxygen saturation is
calculated from a predetermined algorithm. If these
were the only conditions of the measurement,
