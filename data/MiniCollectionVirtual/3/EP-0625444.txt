<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to child seats (1) which can be set up by moving parts of the rear seat bench (5) of passenger cars. So that no loose parts are required for getting the child seats (1) ready and none occur when setting the seats up, and so that a securely positioned and well-upholstered child seat (1) is guaranteed, a front padded part (7) of the divided seat (2) is swung to the rear onto the rear padded part (8) around a seam (11) of the cover (9), the seat belt for adults also being used for children.
