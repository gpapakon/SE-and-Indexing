<ABSTRACT>
A package for free-flowing products comprising a product container and a closable applicator point fitted on its outlet aperture is to provide a means of precisely metering the quantity of product expelled regardless of the level in the package and at the same time ensure easy handling. This is achieved in that the product container (2) takes the form of an extruded tubular aluminium recipient having, at least in part, externally depressable walls (6 or 9) which spring back when the pressure is released.
