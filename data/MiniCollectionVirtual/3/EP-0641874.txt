<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a surface treatment device for 
performing a surface treatment such as plating by feeding a 

treating liquid to an inside peripheral surface of a 
cylindrical portion of a work wherein a treating liquid feeding 

path is connected to a treating liquid feeding pipe for feeding 
the treating liquid from a tank wherein a treating liquid 

discharging path is connected to a treating liquid recovering 
pipe for collecting the treating liquid in said tank and that a

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface treatment device for carrying out a 
surface treating method applied for a plating treatment, a pretreatment 
therefor, etc. in the plating of an inside periphery of a cylindrical portion 
of a work, such as a cylinder block of an engine, and especially for 
subjecting a surface to be treated to a high speed surface treatment while 
allowing a treating liquid to flow. A variety of techniques concerning a surface treatment such as plating 
of a surface to be treated of a work or a degreasing treatment as a 
pretreatment therefor have been hitherto known. For example, a method is 
generally known in which a work is immersed in a treating liquid contained in 
a tank for performing plating, etc. This method, however, requires a long 
treatment time and is not efficient. Additionally, this method requires 
high costs for the treatment of a waste liquid, etc. Thus, a method is proposed in which a treating liquid is allowed 
to flow relative to a surface to be treated of a work with a 
view toward improving the treating efficiency and realising a 
high speed treatment (DE 39 37 763, ER 2 685 924 A1). For 
example, Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 1-52480 
discloses a surface treatment device applied for the degreasing 
treatment in chrome plating of an inside surface of cylinder of 
an engine, in which each of the openings at both ends of the 
engine cylinder is plugged with a plug through a sealing 
material. One of the plugs is provided with a treating liquid 
feed passage while the other plug is provided with a treating 
liquid return passage. The both passages are in fluid 
communication with the inside space of the cylinder. A tank for 
the treating liquid, a pump, valves, etc. are connected  
 
to a piping system including the above passages. In the thus constructed 
device, the treating liquid is recirculated with a pump through the treating 
liquid feed passage--inside of the cylinder--treating liquid return 
passage--tank. The flow of the treating liquid through the inside of the 
cylinder permits a high speed treatment of the inside the surface the 
cylinder. While the above publication mainly describes a case in which the device 
is applied for a degreasing step, it is also effective to allow a plating 
liquid to flow relative to a surface to be treated of a work in a plating 
step. Especially when an inside peripheral surface of a cylindrical portion 
of a cylinder or the like is subjected to plating, a high speed plating 
treatment can be accomplished by
