<ABSTRACT>
A system for allowing a content addressable memory (CAM) to operate 
with first and second power voltage levels including: a first input voltage for 

providing a first bias to the content addressable memory; a second input 
voltage for providing a second bias to the content addressable memory; and 

a selection device coupled to the first input voltage and the second input 
voltage for decoupling the first input voltage from the content addressable 

memory and coupling the second input voltage to the content addressable 
memory in response to coupling the second power voltage level to the content 

addressable memory. In a specific embodiment the system includes: a first 
power on reset coupled to the content addressable memory for initializing the 

content addressable memory when the first power voltage level is initially 
coupled to the content addressable memory; and a second power on reset 

coupled to the content addressable memory for initializing the content 

addressable memory when the second power voltage level is initially coupled 
to the content addressable memory. The system allows a CAM to operate at 

a power voltage level of 2.6 to 3.6 volts to reduce power dissipation and at a 
higher voltage during programming of an electrically programmable memory. 

The system provides multiple resets to a CAM for proper operation with multiple 
power supply levels. The system also provides a CAM that allows access to 

redundant addresses of an electrically programmable read only memory 
(EPROM) and that allows programming of the EPROM with traditional 

programming equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to content addressable memory (CAM) to store the
address location for the defective bit in memory redundancy scheme and more
particularly to content addressable memories with multiple power voltage levels.A conventional content addressable memory (CAM) is composed of an
array of stored words with each word in the array having an associated
comparator. When a comparand data is presented to the CAM, a simultaneous
compare operation is performed between the comparand and all the words in
the array. If the comparand and a word in the CAM are matched, then a match
signal is generated. A user can program a CAM by writing data into the array.One application of a CAM is to provide for access to redundant
addresses in an electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM). The
CAM compares addresses for the EPROM to a set of addresses that are known
to have manufacturing defects. If an address to the EPROM matches the
contents of the CAM, then the address can be converted to a redundant row
or column address for the spare elements of the EPROM, which provides
redundancy for the EPROM as fault correction. The CAM and the EPROM can
be fabricated together onto a single integrated circuit.A conventional CAM operates from a single power supply voltage, which
is typically a 5 volt Vcc power supply. This invention is related to low voltage
EPROM design, which the operating Vcc is typically 3.3v with a range from 2.6v 
to 3.6v.If a CAM is fabricated on the same integrated circuit with an EPROM,
then the CAM must operate properly when the EPROM on the integrated circuit
is programmed with a conventional programmer. To program an EPROM using
traditional programming equipment, a programming voltage Vpp of about 12
volts is applied and the Vcc power supply is raised to 6.25 volts. If a CAM
normally operates at a Vcc power supply level of 5 volts, then the CAM circuit
Vcc operation window can accommodate raising the voltage from 5 volts to 6.25
volts.If a conventional CAM design is operated at a Vcc power supply of 3.3
volts for the portable systems, without sacrificing power and speed, the CAM
circuit Vcc operation window does not have the range to accommodate raising
the Vcc power supply for the CAM from 3.3 volts to 6.25 volts, when the EPROM
is programmed with a conventional programmer.One approach to solve this problem would be to design the EPROM to
be programmed at lower voltages; however, this approach would preclude the
use of conventional EPROM programming equipment, which requires that high
