A copying system is provided in which an image 
inputting unit (1) and an image outputting unit (2) are 

connected via a conventional data transmission path (4), 
and copying operation is performed at the same speed as 

the conventional standalone copying machine. The image 
inputting unit (1) has a first communicating unit (61), 

and the image outputting unit (2) has a second 
communicating unit (64). Image data is transferred 

directly from the image inputting unit (1) to the image 
outputting unit (2) via the first communicating unit 

(1), the transmission path (4) and the second 
communicating unit (64) after a copying operation is 

initiated by a controlling unit (3). A scanning

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
copying systems, and more particularly to a copying
system in which a unit component, such as an image
inputting unit and an image outputting unit, of the
copying system can be shared with other image processing
systems.In recent years, various systems for
construction of a digital copy machine have been
suggested. For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application 64-25673 discloses a system in which each
function of the system is independently provided as a
module unit. That is, the system comprises module units
such as an image processing unit, a scanning unit and a
printing unit. The copying function is achieved when
those units are packaged into one body. Image data
produced by the scanning unit is transmitted through the
image processing unit to the printing unit.Fig.1 shows a typical construction of the
above-mentioned conventional copying machine. In Fig.1,
a scanner 51 scans an original sheet to generate image
data. A printer 53 forms an image onto a recording
sheet in accordance with the image data. The image data
is transferred from the scanner 51 to the printer 53 via
an image processing unit (IPU) 52. Additionally, an 
interface (I/F) 56 is provided to the copying machine,
which interface is connected to a data transmission path
(not shown in the figure) so as that the copying machine
can communicate with other devices connected to the
transmission path. A controlling unit (SCU) 54 and a
panel 55 are provided for controlling a copying
operation as well as communication performed by the copy
machine.In the above-mentioned copying machine, the
scanner 51 can serve as an independent image inputting
unit for an external image processing system. That is,
image data generated by the scanner 51 can be
transferred via the transmission path to other units as
indicated by arrows A and C of Fig.1 The printer 53 can
serve as an independent image outputting unit for an
external image processing system. That is, image data
generated can be transferred via the transmission path
from other units as indicated by arrows D and B of Fig.1An image data transfer from the scanner 51 to
the printer 53 is performed via the IPU 52 as indicated
by arrows A and B of Fig.1. The data transfer is
performed while a scanning operation is performed in
synchronization with an image forming operation of the
printer 53. However, an image data transfer via the
transmission path and interface 56 is performed in 
accordance with the conventional data transmission
protocol, and thus a
