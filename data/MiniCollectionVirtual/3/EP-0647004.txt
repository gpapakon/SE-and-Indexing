<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sealed housing for a junction (tap-off) box, this housing (10) comprising a body (11) and a lid (19) intended to be fitted on this body. The body includes a bottom (12) and sidewalls (13) that are provided with an edge (21) of smaller thickness. The lid (19) is provided with a rim having a groove (20) intended for receiving the edge (21) of the sidewalls. The groove (20) is defined by an inner flap (tab) (22) and a springy outer flap (23). The thickness of the outer flap is such that, after fitting the lid onto the body, the sidewalls of the housing present no external protuberance.

A sealed case for a connecting box, having a body (11) equipped with a base plate 
(12), side walls (13) and a cover (19), said cover and side walls being equipped with 

an engagement device arranged to enable the cover and body to be assembled, and 
comprising : 


a peripheral groove (20) arranged in a lip of the cover (19) between a first internal 
tab (22) and a flexible second external tab (23), 
an edge (21) securedly united to the side walls (13) and designed to be engaged in 
said groove, the end of said edge (21) having a zone of lesser thickness having a 

wedge-shaped front part (26), 
and flexible coupling means, 
 
characterized in that : 


the edge (21) comprises a rear part arranging a peripheral recess (27) located at the 
base of said front part (26), and an inclined first face (29) bearing on an inclined 

surface (30) of the flexible second tab (23), so as to push the latter outwards in a first 
phase of movement of the cover (19) and body (11) towards one another, 
the internal first tab (22) comprises an inclined surface (31) cooperating with a 
conjugate second face (28) of the front part (26) to perform self-centering of the cover 

(19) in the course of a second phase of movement, 
a boss (25) is arranged on the internal wall of the external second tab (23) to 
engage in the peripheral recess (27) when a third phase of movement takes place, 
an internal recess (24) is situated on the second tab (23) between the boss (25) and 
the groove (20) to receive a swelling (32) situated on the same side as the first face 

(29) of the wedge-shaped front part (26), the external second tab (23) and the 
peripheral recess (27) forming said flexible coupling means, 
and clearance zones arranged at the four corners of the external tab (23). 
The case according to claim 1, characterized in that the sum of the thickness e2 at 
the level of the junction of the edge (21) and of the side walls (13), and of the 

thickness e3 of the flexible tab (23) is appreciably equal to the thickness e1 of the wall 
of the body (11), so that the external junction zone of the body (11) and cover (19) is 

smooth.
