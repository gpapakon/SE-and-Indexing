<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for reducing the spurious spectral lines contained in a digital frequency synthesizer (10) output signal, receiving, on the one hand, a clock signal (E) originating from a modulator (11) and supplying an output signal (Sdds) at a pure frequency (FS) modulated by spurious frequencies. The arrangement includes a frequency demodulator (13) receiving the output signal from the synthesizer (10) and supplying a correction signal, the amplitude (Vm) of which is a function of the frequency excursion of the output signal (Sdds) of the synthesizer (10), this correction signal being applied to the modulator (11) so that it modulates the signal applied to the synthesizer (10) in phase opposition with respect to the spurious modulation, so as to suppress this spurious modulation.

<CLAIMS>
Device for reducing unwanted components of the 
output signal (Sdds) of a digital direct synthesiser (10) 

receiving a first clock signal (E) and a control word (M) and 
supplying said output signal (Sdds) at a pure frequency (FS) 

modulated by unwanted frequencies,
 
characterised in that said first clock signal (E) is obtained 

from a modulator (11) and in that it includes a frequency 
demodulator (13) receiving said output signal (Sdds) of said 

synthesiser (10) and supplying a correction signal whose 
amplitude (Vm) is conditioned by the frequency excursion of 

said output signal (Sdds) of said synthesiser (10), said 
correction signal being applied to said modulator (11) so that 

it modulates said signal applied to said synthesiser (10) 180Â° 
out of phase with said unwanted modulation, so as to eliminate 

said unwanted modulation. 
Device according to claim 1 characterised in that 
said demodulator (13) is a demodulator employing a delay 

line (21). 
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised 
in that a peak limiter (12) b
etween said synthesiser (10) and 
said demodulator (13) eliminates any amplitude modulation 

introduced by said synthesiser (10). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that said modulator is part of a voltage-controlled 

oscillator (34) receiving said correction signal 
from said demodulator as its control signal. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that said modulator is a mixer (11) receiving 

said correction signal from said demodulator (13) and a second 
clock signal (FH).
