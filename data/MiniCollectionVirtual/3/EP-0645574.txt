<ABSTRACT>
The device (18) for clamping and locking the clamping collar includes a screw (22) located in a transverse direction with respect to the articulated elements of the collar and engaged through two blocks (19, 19') bearing on two articulated elements of the collar including two guide journals (20a, 20b) each engaged and held in an opening in a rod (26a, 26b). The openings (27a, 27b; 28a, 28b) form a pair (27a, 27b) of circular openings and a pair (28a, 27b) of oblong openings. Nuts (25, 25') make it possible to tighten and lock the collar. The clamping collar additionally includes a blocking device (31) consisting of a support (33) including a spacer piece (34) through which an opening passes and which includes parts (35a, 35b) for engaging on the rods (26a, 26b), a lock nut (37) mounted so that it can rotate in the opening of the support (33), means (41) for blocking the lock nut (37) in terms of rotation and in terms of axial translation, and at least one blocking finger (44a, 44b) mounted so that it can pivot on the support (33).

Collar for clamping two tubular parts (3, 4) for their 
sealed connection comprising at least two members (11a, 11c) 

having a part (14a, 14c) in the shape of a portion of a ring, 
pivoted one with respect to the other about a pin (13) parallel 

to the axis of the ring portions (14a, 14c) and comprising an 
internal surface bearing against two bearing surfaces (3a, 4a) 

of the tubular members (3, 4) for their clamping in the axial 
direction with interposition of a gasket (6) and a clamping and 

locking device (18) comprising a screw (22) disposed in a 
transverse direction with respect to the pivoted members (11a, 

11c) and engaged through two bearing blocks (19, 19') each 
comprising a bearing part (19a) on a joggle (17, 17') of one of 

the pivoted members (11a, 11c) and two guide journals (20a, 20b) 
on either side of the bearing part (19a) engaged and retained in 

a pair of openings (27a, 27b; 28a, 28b) passing through in facing 
relationship, two small guide bars (26a, 26b) parallel to each 

other, disposed on either side of parts for joining the pivoted 
members (11a, 11c) comprising the joggles (17, 17') and two nuts 

(25, 25') engaged on the screw (22) and each in abutment with a 
bearing block (19, 19'), the openings (27a, 27b) of a pair of 

openings of the small guide bars (26a, 26b) having a circular 
shape and the other openings (28a, 28b) an oblong shape elongated 

in the direction of the screw (22), characterised by the fact 
that in addition it comprises a locking device (31) constituted 

by: 

a support (33) penetrated by an opening (36) and comprising 
parts (35a, 35b) for engagement on the small bars (26a, 

26b), 
a lock-nut (37) mounted to rotate in the opening (36) of 
the support (33), having a tapped opening (37a) for its 

engagement by screwing on one end (32) of the screw (22) 
situated adjacent the oblong openings (28a, 28b) and a part 

(38) for bearing on the nut (25) engaged on the end (32) of 
the screw, 
means (40, 41) for preventing rotation and axial  
 

translation of the lock-nut (37) with respect to the 
support (33), and 
at least one locking finger (44a, 44b) comprising a locking 
stud (46) and a push-button (47), mounted to pivot on the 

support (33) about an axis perpendicular to the axis of the 
screw (22) between a locking position where the locking 

stud (46) is engaged in an end part of an oblong opening 
(28a, 28b) and an open position, the lock-nut (37) 

comprising a bearing part (38) for keeping the locking 
finger (44a, 44b) in the locking position. 
Clamping collar according to Claim 1, characterised by the 
fact that the support (33) comprises a spacer member (34) and two 

profiled plates (35a, 35b) having raised edges fixed parallel to 
each other on end parts of the spacer member (34), the raised 

edges of the plates (35a, 35b) having a spacing substantially 
equal to the width of the small bars (26a, 26b) and constituting 

the engagement parts of the support (33) and the spacer member 
(34) being penetrated by the opening (36) for the engagement of 

the lock-nut (37). 
Clamping collar according to Claim 2, characterised by the 
fact that the spacer member (34) comprises, in the vicinity of 

its ends fixed to the plates (35a, 35b) joggles (43a, 43b) in 
which two pivoting locking fingers (44a, 44b) are mounted to 

pivot through the intermediary of pins (45a, 45b). 
Clamping collar according to one of Claims 1, 2 and 3, 
characterised by the fact that the lock-nut (37) comprises a 

cheek (38) intended to bear, in the locked position, against the 
nut (25) engaged on the end (32) of the screw (22) and comprising 

a surface for actuating the locking finger (44a, 44b) for 
bringing it into and retaining it in the locking position. 
Clamping collar according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by the fact that the means for preventing rotation 

and axial translation of the lock-nut (37) with respect to the  
 

support (33) comprise a deformable sleeve (41) connected to the 
support (33) and joggles (42) in an end part of the lock-nut 

(37), intended to receive parts deformed by crimping of the 
sleeve (41). 
Clamping collar according to Claim 5, characterised by the 
fact that the sleeve (41) is integral with a base engaged and 

retained on the support (33) by a dovetail assembly. 
Use of a clamping collar according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, for the sealed joining of two parts (3, 4) of a tubular 

support for a column of thermocouples of a pressurised water 
nuclear reactor.
