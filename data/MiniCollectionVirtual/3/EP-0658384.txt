<ABSTRACT>
Expanding apparatus (10) and method for sizing a 
one-piece drop-centre wheel rim (20) having first and 

second ganged arrays (50,52) of rim sizing die segments 
insertable into the rim from one side thereof, and a 

third array (54) of rim sizing die segments insertable 
into the opposite side of the rim, all three arrays 

cooperating to form a complete array of die segments for 
expansion sizing of the rim. A single wedge mechanism 

(60) moves the arrays radially outwardly to individually 
size the inboard bead seat (32), outboard bead seat (24) 

and drop-centre well (28) zones of the rim in response to 
relative coaxial movement of the wedge and arrays in a 

rim expansion working stroke along a longitudinal axis of 
the wedge. The wedge includes an expansion cone 

mechanism comprising first, second and third cone-cams 
(200,202,204) respectively individually operably 

associated with the first, second and third die arrays 
for radially expanding the same in such working stroke. 

A set-up adjustment mechanism disposed interiorly of the 
wedge has three concentrically arranged lead screws 

(210,212,214) individually threadably coupled to each of 
the cone cams for carrying and selectively positioning 

the same along the longitudinal axis of the wedge to 
thereby vary the set-up end limit of radially outward 

movement of the associated die segment array for a given 
relative working stroke of the wedge means and arrays. 

A gear drive (300,302) coupled to the exterior end of 
each lead screw individually rotates, and is driven 

either manually or by servo motors operably coupled to 
each worm gear drive. Cone cam position sensors 

(320,322,324) each develop a signal indicative of the 
axially adjusted set-up position of each associated cone  

 
cam. A signal processing control system (313) utilizes 

the signals for controlling the servo motors to drive the 
cone cams and thereby control their adjusted set-up 

positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus of sizing a one-piece wheel rim
according to the preambles of claims 1 and 5 respectively,
and more particularly for truing roundness and
size of tire-carrying wheel rims by permanent deformation
expansion of the same. Although the present invention may
be employed for expanding various types and sizes of
vehicle wheel rims, it finds particular utility in
expanding rims of the one-piece drop-centre type.In the manufacture of vehicle wheel drop-centre rims
as now commercially produced, a strip of sheet metal
stock cut to suitable width and length is coiled and the
strip ends flash-butt-welded together to provide an
annular element. The axial end portions of the annular
element are flared outwardly in a flaring station and
then the flared annular element is roll-formed in one or
more roll-forming machines to provide a rim element which
has a rough drop-centre rim contour and which is slightly
diametrically undersize relative to rim final dimensions.
The rolled rim element is then conveyed to a shaping
apparatus, usually called an expander, in which the rim
element is diametrically expanded by a segmental
expansion die fixture to circumferentially stretch the
material beyond its yield point to thereby impart a
permanent set to the material at an enlarged finished
diameter. Rim expander apparatus of this character is
described in US-A-1 926 400 and in US-A-5 010 759
on which the preambles of claims 1 and 5 are based.Such rim expanding apparatus is provided with
radially movable shaping die segments arranged in a
circular array and cooperating at their radially
outermost surfaces to form an annular peripheral surface
corresponding to the cross-sectional contour of the rim
to be expanded. The die segments are moved from their
innermost retracted positions radially outwardly into 
engagement with the rim to diametrically expand the rim
a predetermined amount to circumferentially stretch and
permanently set the rim material to thereby both
accurately size and impart a true circular contour to the
rim.Such rim expanders developed for use with channel or
drop-centre wheel rims are typically provided with two
sets of axially opposed segmental die fixtures adapted to
be mounted one each on fixed and movable members of a
horizontal or vertical axis press. The press mounted die
fixtures are thus coaxially relatively movable and
axially separable from one another to permit loading of
a rim workpiece therebetween. The opposed fixtures are
respectively inserted
