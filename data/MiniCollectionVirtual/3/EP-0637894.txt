<ABSTRACT>
Motion vectors between a current frame and its preceding 
frame of video signals are optimally determined to a half-pixel 

accuracy by finding a plurality of full-pixel resolution 
motion vectors corresponding to a plurality of best matching 

blocks in a search region; and, thereafter, deriving a half-pixel 
resolution motion vector by selecting an half-pixel 

resolution block which yields the minimum error function out 
of all possible half-pixel resolution candidate blocks 

included in half-pixel resolution search regions, each of 
which corresponding to one of the full-pixel motion vectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for determining motion vectors between a current frame and
a preceding frame of video signals to
a half-pixel accuracy.As is well known, transmission of digitized video signals
can attain video images of a much higher quality than the
transmission of analog signals. When an image signal
comprising a sequence of image "frames" is expressed in a
digital form, a substantial amount of data is generated for
transmission, especially in the case of a high definition
television system. Since, however, the available frequency
bandwidth of a conventional transmission channel is limited,
in order to transmit the substantial amounts of digital data
therethrough, it is inevitable to compress or reduce the
volume of the transmission data. Among various video
compression techniques, the so-called hybrid coding technique, 
which combines temporal and spatial compression techniques
together with a statistical coding technique, is known to be
most effective.Most hybrid coding techniques employ a motion compensated
DPCM(differential pulse code modulation), two-dimensional
DCT(discrete cosine transform), quantization of DCT
coefficients, and VLC(variable length coding). The motion
compensated DPCM is a process of determining the movement of
an object between a current frame and its previous frame, and
predicting the current frame according to the motion flow of
the object to produce a differential signal representing the
difference between the current frame and its prediction. This
method is described, for example, in Staffan Ericsson, "Fixed
and Adaptive Predictors for Hybrid Predictive/Transform
Coding", IEEE Transactions on Communications, COM-33, No.
12(December 1985); and in Ninomiya and Ohtsuka, "A Motion-Compensated
Interframe Coding Scheme for Television Pictures",
IEEE Transactions on Communications, COM-30, No. 1 (January
1982).The two-dimensional DCT, which reduces or removes spatial
redundancies between image data, converts a block of digital
image data, for example, a block of 8x8 pixels, into a set of
transform coefficient data. This technique is described in
Chen and Pratt, "Scene Adaptive Coder", IEEE Transactions on
Communications, COM-32, No. 3(March 1984). By processing such
transform coefficient data with a quantizer, zigzag scanning, 
and VLC, the amount of data to be transmitted can be
effectively compressed.Specifically, in the motion compensated DPCM, current
frame data is predicted from the corresponding previous frame
data based on an
