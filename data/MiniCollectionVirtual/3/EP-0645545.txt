<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clamping mechanism for connecting a hollow profile 2, provided with a latching cutout, to a load-bearing element exhibiting a clamping border extension, in particular for connecting hollow-profile rods to vertical supports, exhibiting undercut grooves as clamping border extensions, of frameworks which can be assembled and dismantled, having a clamping spring 5 which can be introduced into the hollow profile, can be arrested in a latching cutout 3 of the hollow profile via a driver 13, can be transferred, by a rotary movement of the driver 13, from an initial clamping position into an end clamping position and has clamping fingers 6, 7 which engage behind the clamping border extension in the end clamping position and, during the clamping movement of the clamping spring 5, can be moved into a clamping expansion position directed transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the clamping spring. In order to have, in particular, a relatively simple part with reliable arresting in the assembled position, there is arranged between the clamping fingers 6, 7 of the clamping springs 5 a slide 10 which can be moved in a translatory manner relative to said clamping spring and exhibits at least one spring tongue element 11. Via the slide 10, the clamping fingers 6, 7 can be transferred, during the slide movement, from their initial clamping position into their clamping expansion position. The clamping spring 5 and the slide 10 each exhibit a driver guide 16, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 19 which exhibits at least one cam way and into which at least one driver piece 17, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 18, 18.1 which is fixed on the driver 13 engages for movement coupling. Furthermore the clamping spring 5 exhibits a shaped cutout 12 assigned to the spring tongue element 11 and can be transferred by the spring tongue element 11, during the slide movement, for clamping-mechanism arresting in the hollow profile 2.
