<ABSTRACT>
In a seismic data processing system a 
multi-dimensional assemblage of time/velocity functions 

is sampled for velocity as a function of incremental 
time. The samples are stored in a matrix arranged in 

columns along the time axis and rows across the 
velocity axis. The count of the number of samples 

resident in the respective cells of each row is 
indexed. A desired statistical operator is applied to 

the count indices in the rows to provide a family of 
filtered histograms in time-sequential order. The 

filtered histograms (24) may be edited by delimiting 
acceptable velocities to lie between preselected 

percentiles (17, 19) which may be displayed with the 
filtered histograms (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seismic data processing
and is concerned with methods for statistically
studying and editing seismic velocities, such as are
used for stacking and migration processes as applied in
the geophysical exploration of the subsurface of the
earth.Stacking and migration of raw seismic data
requires a knowledge of the propagation velocity
(hereinafter referred to simply as "velocity") of an
acoustic wavefield through subsurface earth formations.
Usually the velocity is calculated directly from the
seismic data using, as arguments, the square of the
reflection travel time, t, and the square of the
source-receiver offset, x, whereat that travel time was
measured. Any one of a number of well-known algorithms
may be used for the calculations.Customarily velocity analyses are calculated at
regular spatial intervals throughout the survey area
often associated with selected CMP (common mid point)
gathers. A typical velocity analysis may be presented
as a time/velocity plot. The velocity data are
estimated from the seismic reflection trajectories
which are often contaminated with noise. A velocity
analysis presentation may take the form of contours of
trace-to-trace coherence or in the form of semblance
peaks having an amplitude proportional to the goodness of
the inter-trace correlation. Because of noise
generated artifacts, most velocity analyses require a
modest amount of interpretation before determining
which semblance or coherence maxima will be used to
construct the velocity function representative of the
data. The velocities determined in the manner described
above usually vary vertically as an increasing function
of depth (time) and they may vary spatially as a
function of offset and azimuth. In a relatively
confined local area with minimal structural dip angles,
a single depth-varying average velocity function
suffices for the migration process. For an extended
regional survey, in the presence of a significant
lateral velocity gradient and steep formation dips, a
three-dimensional, depth and spatially varying,
velocity must be considered. That process requires
very expensive complex computer data processing.Various approximate methods have been devised for
economical data-migration in the presence of a
significant lateral velocity gradient. One very
successful technique makes use of a residual migration
process. The basis of that technique involves
migrating the data during a first pass using a constant
minimal migration velocity. That step is followed by a
second migration pass
