<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electronic arrangement with linearised and symmetrised response. It also relates to an oscillator with low harmonic content. It finds an application particularly in a remote control signal transmitter. According to the invention, a device for linearising and symmetrising the response of the amplifier (18) of a harmonic oscillator (16), arranged at the output of a remote control word generator element (11-15), is set up in such a way as to reduce the harmonic content.
