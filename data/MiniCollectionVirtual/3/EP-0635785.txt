<ABSTRACT>
The data recorder device comprises: a temporary save medium (MEM) of electronic technology, the data (D) originating from the interface (IT) being recorded temporarily on the temporary save medium (MEM) in succession according to their reception, and means (AC, TH) suitable for obtaining at least one chosen magnitude relating to a predetermined environmental or operating condition, and for delivering a datum representative of the said magnitude obtained (AO, TO). The control unit (UT) comprises a recording mode in which the magnitude obtained (AO, TO) is compared with at least one predetermined value (A2, T2), and in the presence of an obtained magnitude greater than the said predetermined value, no access to the recording medium (DIS) is permitted, whilst in the presence of an obtained magnitude less than or equal to the said predetermined value, the data stored temporarily on the temporary save medium (MEM) are recorded on the recording medium (DIS) so long as access to the said recording medium is permitted.
