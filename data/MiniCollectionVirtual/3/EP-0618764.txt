<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (17) and method for feeding a printed wiring board (10) 
automatically sets a feeding stroke with respect to different types of printed wiring 

boards and sequentially feeds the boards. In the apparatus (17) for sequentially feeding 
a printed wiring board to a predetermined position, a sensor (27) is provided for 

detecting information on the printed wiring board (10) including the size, shape, color, 
and type of the printed wiring board, whereby a feeding stroke with respect to each of 

the printed wiring boards is set based upon the information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for feeding printed wiring boards suitable for use 
in a mounting machine that automatically mounts 
electronic parts or other parts onto the printed wiring 
boards. FIG. 1 shows a conventional example of a mounting 
machine that automatically mounts electronic parts on a 
printed wiring board. In particular, FIG. 1 depicts a 
device for exchanging a printed wiring board, hereinafter 
referred to as a printed wiring board exchange device. 
The printed wiring board exchange device includes a 
loading unit 11, a unit 13 for positioning a printed 
wiring board, hereinafter referred to as a printed wiring 
board positioning unit, an unloading unit 15, and a unit 
17 for feeding the printed wiring board, hereinafter 
referred to as a printed wiring board feeding unit. A printed wiring board 10 is conveyed by a 
conveyor belt (not shown) to a tip end of the loading 
unit 11 from the right side in the drawing. Next, the 
printed wiring board 10 carried on the loading unit 11 is 
fed to the printed wiring board positioning unit 13 by 
the printed wiring board feeding unit 17. As shown in FIG. 1, the printed wiring board 
positioning unit 13 has a movable part shiftable in a 
feeding direction (X direction) of the printed wiring 
board 10 and in a direction (Y direction) perpendicular 
thereto, whereby the printed wiring board 10 carried on 
the printed wiring board positioning unit 13 can be moved 
by desired distances in the X and Y directions. Thus, 
the printed wiring board 10 may be positioned accurately  
 
at a predetermined position by the printed wiring board 
positioning unit 13 before the mounting of electronic 
parts or other parts on the surface thereof. After the step of mounting the electronic parts on 
the printed wiring board 10 has been completed, the 
printed wiring board 10 is fed to the unloading unit 15 
by the printed wiring board feeding unit 17. The 
unloading unit 15 is provided with a passage confirmation 
sensor 25 which acts to detect that the printed wiring 
board 10 was fed to the unloading unit 15. The printed wiring board feeding unit 17 has a 
movable feeding part 19 which feeds the printed wiring 
board 10. More specifically, the movable feeding part 19 
has an arm 21A which is provided at its tip end with a 
feeding nail 21. When the movable feeding part 19 is 
moved along its feeding direction, the feeding nails 21 
also move in the feeding direction. FIG. 2 illustrates, by one-dot chain lines, a 
printed wiring board

<CLAIMS>
A printed wiring board feeding apparatus for sequentially feeding printed 

wiring boards in a forward feeding direction from a loading area to a 
predetermined position, comprising : 


(a) a feeding unit (19) for feeding each of said printed wiring boards 
(10) from the loading area (11) to the predetermined position (P1/P2) by a feeding 

operation, the feeding unit (19) being adapted for movement in the reverse feeding 
direction for alignment with a wiring board located at the loading area and for 

movement in the forward feeding direction in association with said wiring board so 
as to displace the wiring board to said predetermined position; 
(b) a sensor (27) for detecting the length of each of said printed wiring 
boards in the feeding direction, the sensor being arranged such that movement of 

the feeding unit (19) causes a relative motion between the sensor and the wiring 
board in the feeding direction, said relative motion being longer than the length 

(L1) of the wiring board in the feeding direction; and 
(c) feed stroke determining means (41) for separately determining a 
feeding stroke for each of said printed wiring boards (10) based upon the 

information detected by said sensor (27) 
so that each of said boards is fed to said predetermined 

position (P1/P2). 
The printed wiring board feeding apparatus (17) according to claim 1, 
further comprising a nail (21) for engaging an edge of each of said printed wiring 

boards (10) while each of said printed wiring boards is being fed to said 
predetermined position and wherein said sensor (27) is attached to said nail (21). 
The printed wiring board feeding apparatus (17) according to claim 2, 
wherein said sensor (27) and said nail (21) are located on said feeding unit (19).

(b) setting the predetermined position (P1/P2) to which the printed 
wiring board is to be moved; 
(c) providing a feeding unit (19) and moving said feeding unit in the 
reverse feeding direction for alignment with the wiring board located at the loading 

area and in the forward feeding direction in association with said wiring board so 
as to displace the wiring board to said predetermined position; 
(d) detecting the length of the printed wiring board in the feeding 
direction using a sensor arranged (27) such that the movement of the feeding unit 

(19) causes a relative motion between the sensor and the wiring board in the
