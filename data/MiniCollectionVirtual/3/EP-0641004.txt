<DESCRIPTION>
U.S. Patent 5,027,092 entitled "Tripping 
Arrangement for Molded Case Circuit Interrupter" 
describes an operating mechanism that is 
controlled by an electronic trip unit. The trip 
actuator unit interfacing between the electronic 
trip unit and the operating mechanism is described 
within U.S. Patent 5,172,088 entitled "Molded Case 
Circuit Breaker Combined Accessory Actuator Reset 
Lever". The use of an electronic trip unit within 
such circuit breakers in place of standard 
thermal-magnetic trip units allows for some 
savings by using rating plugs to provide a single 
circuit breaker housing over a wide range of 
electrical distribution circuit ampere ratings. 
U.S.Patent 4,728,914 and the references contained 
therein describe the function of the rating plug 
in circuit with the electronic trip unit to set 
the ampere rating. The use of electronic trip 
units has also been found to contribute to the 
overall cost of the circuit breaker since current 
transformers are required to sample the circuit 
current and input the current to the electronic 
trip unit for evaluation. It would be economically 
advantageous to provide a circuit breaker having 
the facility of electronic trip units and being 
economically comparable with earlier circuit 
breakers employing less expensive thermal-magnetic 
trip units.  One purpose of the invention is to provide a 
circuit breaker operating mechanism and contact 
arm assembly requiring less components than 
similar state-of-the-art designs resulting in a 
substantial savings in the cost of the components 
and the cost of their assembly. The invention comprises a molded case circuit 
breaker controlled by an electronic trip unit that 
is cost-competitive with those circuit breakers 
employing a thermal-magnetic trip unit. A contact 
arm assembly requiring a minimum number of 
operating components and reduced assembly time is 
employed. The main movable contact arms are 
formed from a high speed punch and die to 
eliminate machining. A locating bracket is used 
to space and align the main and arcing movable 
contact arms as well as to support the operating 
mechanism arc shield. A guide bracket arranged on 
the contact arm assembly aligns the movable arcing 
contact arm and provides a stop to the contact arm 
under short circuit interruption. A stream-lined 
operating cradle assembly is utilized along with 
the contact arm assembly. Figure 1 is a front perspective view of a 
molded case circuit breaker enclosure containing 
the contact arm assembly according to the
