<ABSTRACT>
An image processing system is capable of proving 
that identification information is added to a print by 

providing a function (305 to 307, particularly 307, in 
Fig. 3 flow chart) for detecting whether a printer has 

a function for adding the identification information to 
a printed matter when transferring image data from an 

electronic apparatus (201 in Fig. 1) which processes 
the image data to the printer. The system enables to 

prevent illegal color copying of banknotes or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing
system and an image processing apparatus having a
forgery-prevention capability.Lately along with remarkable improvement of color
copying machines and color printers, there have been
reported those crimes of counterfeiting bank notes and
securities by illegally using these color copying
machines and color printers.To prevent these crimes, therefore, there have been
proposed a technology for adding to an image print the
information which permits to specify a serial number of
a copying machine used or otherwise a technology for
detecting a specified original and preventing this
specified original from being copied.For example, EP-A-0506332 discloses a copier in
which processing is carried out to determine whether the
image being copied is a specific original and, if it is,
a pattern is added to the output image identifying the
copier.However, the conventional printers have not been 
furnished with means capable of accurately detecting
whether a function for adding the identification
information is provided.Accordingly, for transferring image data from
electronic equipment such as an image scanner and a
computer to a printer and printing the image data, it
has not always been guaranteed that the identification
information is added to the printed copies. When
reading the original on the image input device and
outputting the image from this image data input device,
it has not been able to certify at the image output
device that the image input device provides the
function to determine the specified original.Therefore, when printing image data transferred
from the image input device to the image output device,
it has not always been guaranteed that the specified
original is identified at the image input device and
the output of image data is controlled.In addition, both image input and out devices
could not certify that they are respectively provided
with the specified original detecting function and the
identification code addition function.It is an object of the present invention to
address one or more of the above problems. According to the present invention, there is
provided an image processing system as set out in claim
1, an image forming apparatus as set out in claims 9 and
12, an image processing apparatus as set out in claims
16 and 19, and an image data transfer apparatus as set
out in claim 23. Other aspects and features of the present
invention will be obvious from the description of the
embodiments and drawings shown in the following
