<ABSTRACT>
Carbonaceous chars capable of catalytically decomposing aqueous hydrogen peroxide at higher rates at given char densities than other known catalytic chars are provided for. This improvement is provided by an increase in the catalytic activity at a given char density of the said catalytically-active carbonaceous char. The catalytically-active carbonaceous chars are useful for, but not limited to, the catalytic conversion of H2S, SOx, NOx, peroxides, and/or chloramines in liquid and/or gaseous media. The catalytic activity of the char can be measured by adding the char to an apparatus (10) comprising a Dewar container (11) positioned on a magnetic stirrer (12) including a stir bar (13), a cap (14), a funnel (15), a vent (16), an opening (17), a thermocouple (18), an ice point compensator (21) and a strip chart recorder (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stable, catalytically-active, high-temperature carbonaceous char
capable of rapidly decomposing hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solutions.Carbonaceous chars which are capable of functioning as catalysts per se are well known. The
presence of charcoal has been known to enhance a variety of oxidation reactions, including the oxidation
of hydrogen sulfide and SO2. In those instances where carbonaceous chars have been observed to affect
such reactions, they have functioned generally as true catalysts, i.e. they have affected only the rate of
a given reaction, but have not themselves been changed by the reaction to any significant degree.Carbonaceous chars prepared from nitrogen-rich starting materials have been known to be much
more effective in catalyzing certain reactions, such as hydrogen peroxide decomposition, than those
prepared from nitrogen-poor feedstocks. Similarly, enhanced catalytic properties are known to be
imparted into chars prepared from nitrogen-poor starting materials by exposing such chars to nitrogen-containing
compounds such as ammonia at high temperatures. More recently, catalytically-active chars
have been prepared by the calcination or calcination/activation of low- or high-temperature chars
prepared from nitrogen-rich materials such as polyacrylonitrile and polyamide. Catalytically-active chars
also have been prepared from nitrogen-poor starting materials by the calcination of high-temperature
chars in the presence of nitrogen-containing compounds such as ammonia. In all cases, high-temperature
carbonaceous chars are those produced by thermal treatment at temperatures greater than 700°
C. Low-temperature carbonaceous chars have not been subjected to temperatures greater than 700°C.Advantages have been found in oxidizing the high-temperature char prepared from nitrogen-poor
feedstocks prior to or during exposure to nitrogen-containing compounds. Similarly, oxidizing a low-temperature
char prepared from nitrogen-rich feedstocks such as polyacrylonitrile has been found to
enhance the catalytic activity. J. Phys. Chem 47, (1943) (Bente & Walton) "Catalytic activity of activated
nitrogenous carbon" (Document D1) discloses various nitrogenous chars. One of
these, which is a char derived from hexamethylenetetramine, exhibits relatively
high catalytic activity but has a very low density. The others, which are derived
from gelatin, glucosazone, and lactose have much higher densities but exhibit
rather poor catalytic activity, as shown by the slowness of their
