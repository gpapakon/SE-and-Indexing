<ABSTRACT>
A terminal table suitable for use in an electrical 
equipment, which is capable of coping with an existing wiring 

mode in the equipment when a connecting mode on the external 
circuit side is changed. Respective terminal pairs (T) of the 

terminal table (10) are so constructed that one side (X) provides 
terminals of a wire press-tightening and connecting 

mode whereas the other side (Y) provides terminals of a 
crimp-style terminal tightening and connecting mode. The terminal 

table enables a desired external connecting mode to be 
adopted without regard to the equipment wiring mode. Thus, it 

is not necessary to prepare equipments whose wiring modes 
differ or to modify an existing equipment wiring, thereby reducing 

costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wire connecting terminal
table used for an electrical equipment, and particularly
to a terminal table suitable for use in a power converting
device such as an inverter device.In an electrical equipment such as an inverter device or
the like, it is necessary to electrically connect electrically
conductive paths on the electrical equipment side and
conductive paths based on wires or the like on the external
circuit side to one another. Therefore, terminal tables 10A
and 10B have heretofore been used wherein terminal pairs T
comprising terminal sections or portions IT on the electrical
equipment side and terminal sections or portions OT on the
external circuit side, which are electrically connected to
one another, are arranged in parallel in plural form as shown
in Figs. 7 through 10.Figs. 7 and 8 in these drawings respectively show examples
of the terminal tables 10A provided with the terminal
portions fabricated in crimp-style terminal tightening and
connecting structures (modes). Figs. 9 and 10 respectively
show the terminal tables 10B provided with the terminal portions
fabricated in wire press-tightening and connecting
structures (modes). In the drawings, reference numerals 3 indicate
terminal screws provided at terminals of the crimp-style
terminal tightening and connecting structures. Reference
numerals 4 indicate terminal screws provided at terminals
of the wire press-tightening and connecting structures
in the same manner as described above. Reference numerals 6
indicate wire insertion holes defined in the terminals of the
wire press-tightening and connecting structures.Assuming now that the width of each of the terminal
pairs T each having the crimp-style terminal tightening and
connecting structure is represented as m and the width of 
each of the terminal pairs T each having the wire press-tightening
and connecting structure is represented as n, it
is understood that m > n. This is because, in the case of the
terminal table 10A provided with the terminal portions of the
crimp-style terminal tightening and connecting structures,
the dimension of each terminal screw can only be reduced
within a limit, since copper wire from which covering material
has been stripped and the like must be wrapped around
the screw so as to be fixed.Incidentally, Figs. 7 through 10 respectively show the
terminal portions IT on the electrical equipment side and the
terminal portions OT on the external circuit side as illustrative
examples for convenience. Needless to say the terminal
