<ABSTRACT>
An optical device for performing a light 
power transfer between two waveguides that includes a 

first waveguide (224), a second waveguide (255), a transfer rate 
control element (219) for controlling a light power transfer rate 

between the first and second waveguides and an electric 
element (217) for electrically controlling the transfer rate 

control element by imparting electric energy to 
the transfer rate control element. The transfer rate 

control element sets the light power transfer rate to 
zero when the transfer rate control element is in an 

inoperative state. The transfer rate control element 
falls into the inoperative state when the electric element 

imparts no electric energy to the transfer rate control 
element. 
The device may be divided into a plurality of regions comprising e.g. 
an amplifier portion, a light branching-combining portion, an optical 

transmitter portion, an optical receiver portion besides the optical 
coupling portion. 
Use of the device in an optical communication network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical devices
such as integrated semiconductor devices for repeating
a signal, integrated light splitting-combining
devices and semiconductor optical amplifiers. The present
invention also relates to optical communication
networks or systems using the optical devices.In recent years, there has been an increasing
demand for optical devices used in optical local area
networks (optical LAN) in the field of optical
communications. A conventional optical LAN is shown
in Fig. 1. In the optical LAN, a transmitted signal is
taken into respective terminals, and the signal is logically
processed in each terminal and re-transmitted therefrom.
In such a system, optical nodes 12-1~12-4 need' to have
a structure as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 illustrates
the optical node 12-2 as an example. In this structure of
the node, there are provided opto-electric (O/E)
converters 14-1 and 14-2 for respectively converting
a signal transmitted from each of transmission lines
11-1 and 13-1 to an electric signal, a control 
circuit 16 for processing an electric signal, electro-optic
(E/O) converters 15-1 and 15-2 for converting
the electrically processed signal to a light signal to be
re-transmitted to transmission lines 11-2 and 13-2,
and the like.Generally, communication is performed by the above
means in a network as shown in Fig. 1. There may be
a case where communication is interrupted because of
trouble in the network. Therefore, in order to improve
the reliability of the network, the optical nodes
12-1~12-4 need to have a function for coping with
trouble when it occurs. A conventional trouble
countermeasure method in the optical communication
network shown in Fig. 1 will be described.Possible types of trouble or failures are
breakdown of the optical fibers 11 and 13, failure of the
optical nodes 12 to function and so forth. Trouble in
the communication network may include a case
where the transmission line or the optical fiber
is intentionally disconnected at the time of addition of
optical nodes or the like, and a case where an electric
source in the optical node is switched off. When
an optical node 12 is out of order, the network is
divided into two portions at the boundary of the optical
node in trouble.A countermeasure for such trouble will be
described using the system shown in Fig. 1. If the 
transmission line is a single line in an ordinary optical
communication network, the countermeasure of the
division of the network cannot be used. Therefore,
in order to solve such a hardship, two
