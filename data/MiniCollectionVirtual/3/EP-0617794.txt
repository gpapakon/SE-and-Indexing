<ABSTRACT>
A distance measuring system is disclosed in which a user (2) in possession of a portable distance calculator (50) can determine the distance (D1, D) between an actual position (B) and a fixed position (L, P). Satellite position data of the fixed position (L, P) is determined periodically and supplied to the calculator (50). The calculator (50) includes a satellite position receiver (51) and a processor (54) which permit the distance (D1, D) to be determined. In a preferred embodiment error correction is performed by determining a satellite differential position error at a known survey reference location (R) and supplying the error to the calculator (50) for correction of the actual position (B) and, where necessary, the fixed position (L, P).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to distance measurement
and, in particular, discloses a method and appears which is
used to determine the distance between a variable position
and one or more of a number of fixed positions.In many fields of endeavour, such as surveying and
navigation to name but two, it is necessary to determine
distances, preferably quickly, accurately and
economically. Hitherto, line of sight distances have been
determined using lasers and other optical apparatus which,
whilst providing a highly accurate result, are often
expensive and cumbersome to use.One particular example of where known optical devices
are poorly adapted for use is where, during the course of a
game of golf, it is necessary to determine the distance
between the golf ball and the pin position (the "hole").
This is required so that the golf player can choose an
appropriate club with which the ball can be struck. It is
important that the distance be determined with some level of
accuracy in view of the different distances afforded by
different clubs.Typically, a golfer can estimate the distance using his
best judgement. This "traditional" method is that
internationally accepted by the sport at competition levels,
but at non-competitive levels, some players prefer a more
accurate method by which their game can be improved.
Generally, an accuracy better than 10 metres is required as
this, for example, can be the difference in range between a
7 and 8 iron. It is common practice to pace out the distance
from the golf ball to the pin on a golf course. This method
is very time consuming and frustrating for all players, as
it slows down the throughput of the number of players on the
course at one time. US 4,894,655 discloses an aircraft location correction
system where satellite position information of an aircraft
is received by the aircraft together with satellite error
correction data from a base station.US 5,056,106 discloses a positioning system for use on a
golf course which includes a number of refernce location
transmitters and a hand held receiver configured to
triangulate its position with respect to the transmitters.It is an object of the present invention to
substantially overcome, or ameliorate, some or all problems
associated with the prior art.In accordance with a first aspect of the present
invention there is disclosed a transportable distance
calculator comprising:
first receiver means for receiving positioning
information from at least one satellite and for determining
satellite positioning information of said
