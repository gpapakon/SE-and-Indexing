<ABSTRACT>
In the coloured or colourless nail varnish, the size of the dispersed particles is between 2 and 40 nm, and the hardness, measured with a Persoz pendulum, of the film obtained after drying for 24 hours at 30 DEG C and at 50 % relative humidity a layer 300  mu m thick of an aqueous dispersion containing 28 % of dry matter of the abovementioned particles is between 50 and 300 seconds.

Coloured or colourless aqueous nail varnish,
characterized in that it contains dispersed anionic

polyester-polyurethane particles with a particle size of
between 2 and 40 nm, and for which the hardness, measured

using a Persoz pendulum, of the film obtained after
drying, for 24 hours at 30°C and 50% relative humidity,

of a layer 300 µm in thickness of an aqueous 28% dispersion
of solids of the said particles is between 50 and

300 seconds.
Aqueous nail varnish according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the size of the said particles is

between 2 and 30 nm.
Aqueous nail varnish according to either of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the hardness as

defined in Claim 1 is between 80 and 250 seconds.
Nail varnish according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the proportion of

dispersed polyester-polyurethane particles in the said
nail varnish is between 3 and 50%, and preferably between

10 and 50%, by weight relative to the total weight of the
varnish.
Nail varnish according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it also contains

dispersed anionic polyether-polyurethane particles, the
size of the said particles being between 30 and 500 nm

and preferably between 50 and 150 nm.
Nail varnish according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the weight proportion of the said polyether-polyurethane

particles is less than that of the 
polyester-polyurethane particles.
Nail varnish according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it also contains at

least one thickener in a proportion of between 0.01 and
5%, and preferably between 0.01 and 1%, by weight relative

to the total weight of the varnish.
Nail varnish according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the said thickener is chosen from the group

consisting of cellulose and its derivatives, silicates,
clays, synthetic polymers and natural gums.
Nail varnish according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the said thickener is chosen from the group

consisting of hydroxyethylcellulose, laponite and associative
polyurethanes.
Nail varnish according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it also contains at

least one organic or inorganic pigment in a proportion of
between 0.01 and 5%, and preferably between 0.5 and 2%,

by weight relative to the total weight of the varnish.
Nail varnish according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it also contains at

least one water-soluble fluoro surfactant.
Nail varnish according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it also contains at

least one wetting agent, a dispersing agent, an anti-foaming
agent, a sunscreen, a preserving agent, a drying

accelerator, a wax, a silicone or a mixture thereof.
Process for making up the nails, characterized in
that it consists in applying a varnish according to any

one of Claims 1 to 12 to the surface of the nails.
Use, for the preparation of a coloured or colourless
aqueous nail varnish, of dispersed anionic

polyester-polyurethane particles, with a particle size of
between 2 and 40 nm, and for which the hardness, measured

using a Persoz pendulum, of the film obtained after
drying, for 24 hours at 30°C and 50% relative humidity,
