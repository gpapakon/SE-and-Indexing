<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to develop further a known method of this type, so that the accuracy of determination of the production capacity is increased. This object is achieved, according to the invention, in that the average winding speed is measured directly on the running thread at at least one winding station and the average value is formed from this. This average value is taken as a basis for the value of the winding speed for the remaining winding stations. By means of an appropriate control circuit, a correction of the set winding speed can be made automatically, in order to obtain the requisite desired speed. The measurement of the winding speed advantageously takes place contactlessly by means of a transit-time correlator.
