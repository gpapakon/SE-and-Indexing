<ABSTRACT>
The invention takes as its departure point a seal of the abovementioned type, in the case of which there is provided an apron which can be deformed by the vehicle, is adapted thereto and is composed of an upper transverse part (3), of a lower transverse part (22) and of two vertical strips (4) located on both sides of the building opening. In order to secure the lower transverse part in its position, but, nevertheless, to permit the desired deformability, the invention provides, with the lower border of the lower transverse part, an upended, flexible band (22) which consists preferably of spring steel and the wall thickness of which is a number of times smaller than the width thereof. Said band is intended to be fastened on the inner side of the lower transverse part.

Deformable seal for sealing the gap between the 
edge of a building opening (2) and the rear of a vehicle 

which has been driven up to said opening, having a 
deformable apron, which is resilient in the direction 

towards the building and is formed from an upper 
transverse member (3), two vertical strips (4), which 

are disposed on both sides of the building opening, and 
a lower transverse member (22) in the region of the 

lower edge of the building opening (2), the two 
transverse members (3, 22) extending from one strip to 

the other strip (4), the upper transverse member (3) 
being suspended from a cross-piece member (5) in a 

curtain-like manner, and a supporting body co-operating 
with the lower edge of the lower transverse member (22), 

characterised in that the supporting body is a belt 
(23), which stands on its edge, is connected to the 

lower transverse member (22) and is flexible in the 
direction towards the building, the vertical dimension 

of said belt being many times greater than its wall 
thickness. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the belt (23) is formed from steel, more especially 

spring steel. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the belt (23) is formed from a plastics material, 

the physical values of which correspond to those of 
steel. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that at least one elastically resilient supporting cable 

(25) cooperates with the upper edge of the lower 
transverse member (22) - preferably at each end - and is  

 
connected by its upper end to the cross-piece member (5) 

supporting the upper transverse member (3). 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the height of the belt (23) corresponds 

approximately to between 1/6 and 1/4 of the overall 
height of the lower transverse member (22). 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the wall thickness of the belt (23) is 

approximately 0.5 - 2 mm. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the width of the belt (23) is approximately 5 - 15 

cm. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a soft, flexible bottom cover (26) extends from the 

lower edge of the lower transverse member (22) to the 
building, and its rear side is connected to the 

building. 
Seal according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the bottom cover (26) is sealingly connected at its 

laterally external edges to the lateral portions (12), 
which connect the strips (4) to the building amd 

terminate the seal laterally externally. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that at least one return spring, which is configured as 

plate spring (28), extends from the lower edge of the 
lower transverse member (22) or respectively from its 

belt (23) rearwardly towards the building, said return 
spring being supported on the building and arching  

 
towards the side or upwardly when the lower transverse 

member (22) is pressed inwardly. 
Seal according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the plate spring (28) is curved or bent slightly 

upwardly when it is in its non-deformed state. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the belt (23) is connected to the transverse member 

(22) in a surface-to-surface manner, e.g. by gluing, 
riveting or the like. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the belt (23) abuts against the inside of the 

transverse member (22).
