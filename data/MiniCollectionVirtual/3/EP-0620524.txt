<ABSTRACT>
Subject-matter of this invention is a system for use of
semiconductor dynamic memories having faulty locations,

wherein such memories are preliminarily organized as memory
banks in order to form an elementary information word and

subsequently all homologous address locations which contain
errors are identified so as to obtain a map which is stored in a

not-volatile memory (OTP) associated to the memory banks,
thereby creating a transcoding table: and wherein the external

user who desires to retrieve the data contained in the memory
blocks will have access to said not-volatile memory (OTP) by

using successive memory (logic) addresses supplied by an
intelligent section of the system and will receive (material)

transcoded addressed therefrom, which will enable him to have
direct and immediate access to said memory blocks.
In the system according to this invention, aiming at
increasing the number of locations wherein it is possible to

store information, by using also somewhat faulty regions,
techniques designed for application to error correction are

exploited.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention broadly relates to a method and to a 
circuitry to enable use of partially operative memories, that is 
memories having faulty locations, as well as to an equipment 
for mass production of suitable mapped memory blocks and for 
large scale exploitation of such circuit approach. More particularly, a first aspect of this invention related 
to focussing a method to utilize semiconductor dynamic 
memories having manufacturing defects, namely memories 
having faulty locations and as such not utilizable in 
conventional applications. In a second aspect, this invention relates to a circuit 
approach adapted to exploitation of such a method and, 
therefore, adapted to detect and to correct errors not detectable 
or not corrigible by means of approaches according to the 
prior art. In a third aspect, this invention relates to an equipment 
for mapping or practically testing single memory modules and 
for permanently storing the final map in an OTP (One Time 
Programmable) memory, in order to enable use of said memory 
modules in the circuitry and according to the method of this 
invention. Based upon statistical considerations involving the 
inherent defectiveness of the silicon crystal lattice, the 
defectiveness induced by foreign particles into the internal 
geometrical structures of the integrated circuits and the 
defectiveness induced by swings of the production process 
parameters into the internal structures of the integrated 
circuits, it can be argued that the production efficiency of the 
memory circuits is a monotonically decreasing function of the 
utilized silicon surface and in effect of the number of memory 
cells utilized on a single chip. A close analysis of the damages materially caused, 
however, shows that the concerned memory devices have only 
a few rows or a few columns or a few tens of not operative 
locations. Furthermore, such defects can be detected only in 
very severe operation conditions, hardly simulatable without 
particular test equipment.  
 
Anyway, notwithstanding this 
"scarce" defect occurrence rate, said faulty memories cannot be 
employed in such applications as memory banks for traditional 
computers. Taking as a base the observation that, since the 
memories as presently used can be considered as byte-oriented, 
the immediate solution to map all faulty bytes cannot be 
adopted, because as a matter of fact, such a step would require 
more information than one could subsequently store, this 
invention is based upon the concept of developing a memory 
array
