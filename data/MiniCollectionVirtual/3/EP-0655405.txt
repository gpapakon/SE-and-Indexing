<ABSTRACT>
A feeding device (1) for thin and delicate web material 
(W) towards a work station, particularly a forming 

press, comprising longitudinal support and guide means 
(3) of the web (W) and step-feed means (5) of the web 

(W) onto said support and guide means (3) along a 
longitudinal direction (F). The feed means (5) comprise 

a stationary gripper (7) and a movable gripper (9), and 
the longitudinal support and guide means of the web (W) 

comprise a single endless belt (3) having an upper 
bearing run (3a) situated under the web (W) and above 

the movable jaws (15, 18) of the two grippers (7, 9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to the 
handling of continuous, thin and delicate webs of any 
material. A feeder device for feeding a continuous web of stock 
material to a production machine is generally known in the art from 
US-A- 4,513,899.  
 More particularly, the invention is directed to a 
feeding device for such webs towards a work station, 
particularly but not exclusively to a forming press, of 
the type comprising longitudinal support and guiding 
means of the web and step-feed means of the web onto 
said support and guide means along a longitudinal 
direction, wherein the feed means comprise a stationary 
gripper and a movable gripper each including a fixed 
jaw and a movable jaw placed transverse to and on 
opposite sides of the web, a pneumatic actuator 
assembly for operating linear alternative forward and 
back displacement of the movable gripper relative to 
the stationary gripper parallelly to said longitudinal 
direction and opening and closure of the movable jaws 
of said grippers relative to the respective fixed jaws 
in synchronism with the alternative displacement of the 
movable gripper, and an adjustable stop member 
cooperating with the movable gripper at the end of the 
forward displacement thereof. Feeding devices of the above-mentioned type are 
currently manufactured and marketed by ELMER of Turin, 
Italy. Traditionally, in these known feeding devices 
the longitudinal support and guide means of the web 
between the jaws of the two grippers comprise a pair of 
superimposed endless upper and, respectively, lower 
belts, maintained in a stressed condition by respective 
pairs of rollers and having, respectively, a lower run 
and an upper run facing each other and between which 
the web material is longitudinally supported and 
guided. The web and the adjacent runs of the two  
 
endless belts are interposed between the fixed jaws and 
the movable jaws of the two grippers, and the 
disposition is such that the fixed jaws, along with the 
pneumatic actuator assembly and said adjustable stop 
member, are contained within the loop of the lower 
belt, while the movable jaws of the grippers are placed 
within the loop of the upper belt. Evidently, the combined opening and closure movements 
of the movable jaws of the two grippers and the 
alternative synchronised displacement of the movable 
gripper produce translation of the two endless belts 
and the consequent step advancement of the web material 
inserted therebetween, along the longitudinal feed 
direction. In

<CLAIMS>
A feed device (1) for feeding a thin and delicate 
web material (W) to a work station, particularly to a 

forming press, comprising longitudinal support and 
guide means (3) of the web (W) and step-feed means (5) 

of the web (W) onto said support and guide means (3) 
along a longitudinal direction (F), wherein said step 

feed means (5) comprise a stationary gripper (7) and a 
movable gripper (9) each including a fixed jaw (14, 17) 

and a movable jaw (15, 18) placed transverse to and on 
opposite sides of the web, a pneumatic actuator 

assembly (6) for operating linear alternative forward 
and back displacement of the movable gripper (9) 

relative to the stationary gripper (7) parallelly to 
said longitudinal direction (F) and opening and closure 

of the movable jaws (15, 18) of said grippers (7, 9) 
relative to the respective fixed jaws (14, 17) in 

synchronism with the alternative displacement of the 
movable gripper (9), and an adjustable stop member (8, 

22) cooperating with the movable gripper (9) at the end 
of the forward displacement thereof, characterised in 

that the longitudinal support and guide means of the 
web (W) comprise a single lower endless belt (3) having an 

upper bearing run (3a) placed under the web (W) and 
above the movable jaws (15, 18) of the two grippers (7, 

9). 
A feed device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the pneumatic actuator assembly (6) and the 

adjustable stop member (8, 22) are situated above the 
upper bearing run (3a) of said single endless belt (3). 
A feed device according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the fixed jaws of the two grippers (7, 9) 

define respective slide plates (14, 17) above the web 
(W).  

 
A feed device according to claim 3, characterised 
in that at least one bar (25) is extending between said 

slide plates (14, 17), which is directed parallel to 
said longitudinal feed direction (F) of the web (W) and 

is situated immediately above the latter, said at least 
one rod (25) being fixedly secured to the slide plate 

(17) of the movable gripper (9) and being slidably 
coupled along a corresponding groove (26) of the slide 

plate (14) of the stationary gripper (7).
