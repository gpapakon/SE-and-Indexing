<ABSTRACT>
A porous coalescing filter element (25) of conical configuration is disposed within a substantially cylindrical filter housing (21) such that the area between the element and the wall increases in the direction of the primary phase flow to keep the annular velocity substantially constant or decreasing in the direction of primary fluid flow. The element (25) may be manufactured with a round end and tapered walls terminating to a pointed apex, but is more preferably manufactured and secured within the filter housing (21) using flat end caps on both ends. The filter element (25) may be vacuum formed, or manufactured from media in a flat sheet form, which may be pleated if desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coalescing
filter assemblies and coalescing filter elements therefor.The need to separate liquid droplets from gases or
other liquids is long standing in the art. Common liquids
found in air and gas streams include lube oils, water,
salt water, acids, caustics, hydrocarbons, completion
fluids, glycol and amine. The liquid normally is present
in the form of tiny droplets, or aerosols. The size
distribution of the aerosols is primarily dependent on the
surface tension of the liquid contaminant and the process
from which they are generated. As the surface tension is
reduced, the size of the aerosol is reduced accordingly.
This is because the intermolecular cohesive forces (the 
forces which attract the surface molecules of an aerosol
inward in order to minimize surface area with respect to
volume) are weaker.It has been found that greater than 50% of all oil
aerosols by weight are less than 1 micrometer in diameter.
Due to their similar surface tensions, the same holds true
for glycols, amines and hydrocarbons. Conventional
filtration/separation equipment such as settling chambers,
wire mesh (impingement) separators, centrifugal or vane
(mechanical) separators and coarse glass or cellulose
filters are only marginally efficient at 1 micrometer, and
remove virtually none of the prevalent sub-micrometer
aerosols and particles. In order to remove these problem-causing
contaminants, high efficiency coalescing filters
must be used.All previous coalescing filters and coalescing
elements of the type with which the present invention is
concerned are configured in a tubular, cylindrical
arrangement, and used to flow in to out or, from out to
in. While it is advantageous to flow from out to in for
many filter applications, there is also a definite
advantage for flowing in to out for the coalescing of
liquid droplets and aerosols from gases, or the coalescing
of two immiscible liquid phases.In these applications, it is common to use coalescing
elements secured within a pressure-containing vessel or
housing to form a coalescing filter assembly. The
continuous phase gas or liquid contains dispersed liquid
aerosol droplets, sometimes referred to as the
discontinuous phase. The mixture enters the assembly
through an inlet connection and then flows to the inside
of the coalescing element. As the fluid flows through the 
filter media of the coalescing element, the liquid
droplets come in contact with the fibers in the media and
are removed from the fluid stream. Within the media, the
droplets
