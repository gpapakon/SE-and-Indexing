<ABSTRACT>
A filter assembly for an internal combustion engine 
includes inner and outer coaxial filter elements (30, 

31) disposed in a spin-on canister (20) which is 
detachably secured to a mounting adaptor (11). Oil from 

the crankcase is filtered by the outer filter element 
(30) and a substantial volume of the filtered oil flows 

to the primary lubricating circuit of the engine. A 
small percentage of the filtered oil is subjected to 

further filtration by the inner filter element (31) and 
is returned directly to the crankcase. A single gasket 

(70) including a sealing ring (69) and a concentrically 
disposed tubular fitting (72) attached to the sealing 

ring (69) by support legs (74) is positioned to prevent 
commingling of the oil from the crankcase with oil 

filtered by the outer filter element (30) and to 
prevent the oil filtered by the outer filter element 

(30) from commingling with oil filtered by the inner 
filter element (30). In addition, the inner filter 

element is provided with a warm-up orifice (85) to 
insure oil flow regardless of the condition of the 

inner and outer filter element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lubricating oil filter
assembly of the type used on internal combustion
engines. More specifically, the invention relates to a
filter assembly having a spin-on or disposable type
filter cartridge adapted to be secured to a mounting
adaptor on an engine having two lubricating circuits.Even more specifically, the invention pertains to a
filter assembly of the same general type as disclosed
in US Patent 5,078,877. In the known filter assembly,
oil from the crankcase is filtered by an outer filter
element and a substantial volume of the filtered oil
flows to the primary lubricating circuit of the engine.
A small percentage of the filtered oil is subjected to
further filtration by an inner coaxial filter element
and is returned directly to the crankcase. A tubular
fitting extends between end caps on the two coaxial
filter elements to establish communication between the
inner filter element and the mounting adaptor, to
separate the two flow circuits, and to maintain a fixed
axial spacing between the two filter elements.The two filter elements include filter media and
Plastisol potting compound. When the media is in the
form of pleated cellulose paper, both the media and the
Plastisol require high temperature heating after the
filter elements have been manufactured in order to cure
the media. The heating process imparts moisture
resistance and structural strength to the filter media
and seals the elements to the end caps to prevent
contamination from eluding the filtering media.In this known filter assembly, the design of the
end caps and the tubular fitting prevents the two
filter elements from being cured individually before
being assembled with one other. If the filter elements
are cured after being assembled, the outer filter
element acts as a heat shield with respect to the inner 
filter element and thus substantial time is required to
complete the curing process. This problem cannot be
solved by curing the inner element before it is
assembled with the outer element because, under such
circumstances, the inner element acts as a heat sink
once it is assembled with the outer element and as the
outer element is being cured. Regardless of how the
curing is effected, one end cap of the outer filter
element of the known construction cannot be installed
until after the inner filter element has been inserted
into the outer filter element.In some filters, the filter media of the outer
filter element is a synthetic material such as
microglass which is sandwiched between and supported by

An oil filter cartridge (12) comprising a
canister (20) having an open end and an opposite end

(22), an end plate (23) on the open end of said

cap (35) on one end of said first filter (30), a
sealing ring (69) disposed between said first end cap

(35) and said end plate (23) for preventing direct
communication between interior (39) of said first

filter (30) and said inlet ports (27), a second tubular
filter (31) telescoped into and coaxial with said first

filter (30) and located in radially spaced relation
with said first filter (30) whereby oil in the interior

(39) of said first filter (30) may flow radially
through said second filter (31) to the interior (63)

thereof, a second end cap (55) on one end of said
