<ABSTRACT>
A switch rotary valve for connecting a first delivery line to either of two second delivery lines comprises a housing (1) with three connecting openings (4) and connecting passages (6) leading out from the latter and a plug (2) in the form of a circular cylinder which can be rotated in the housing and has a curved through passage (3). In transitional regions (8) which extend across the curved connecting opening (4) in the direction of the passage, the connecting passages (6) and the through passage (3) merge in a straight line and without a step. Between the transitional regions (8) on both sides, essentially the entire through passage (3) is of curved configuration. An advantageous angle range is specified for the total curvature angle ( alpha ) of the through passage (3) as a function of the radii (RR, RK) of the through passage (3) and of the plug (2). By virtue of its optimum dimensioning, the switch rotary valve always has a minimum overall size and is very versatile.
