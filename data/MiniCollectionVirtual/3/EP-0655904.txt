<ABSTRACT>
Alkane diols with 5 to 10 C atoms, preferably straight-chain alkane diols with 5 to 7 C atoms whose OH groups are found in the 1,2-position, are used in cosmetics. The amount of said alkane diols used may lie in a range from 1 to 10 % by weight, preferably 2 to 5 % by weight of the cosmetic product. It has been discovered that alkane diols with 5 to 10 C atoms have a very good skin moistening effect. As these substances have also proven to be compatible with the skin and physiologically neutral, they may be used in high doses as moisture regulating active substances in cosmetic products.
