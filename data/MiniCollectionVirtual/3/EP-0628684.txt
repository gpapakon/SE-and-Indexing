<ABSTRACT>
A key-operated cylinder device includes a cylinder 
device body (1) into which a key (7) having a secondary coil (8) is 

inserted, the cylinder device body including a coil mounting 
portion (11) forming the front end portion of said cylinder device 

body; a primary coil (17) mounted in said coil mounting portion, the 
primary coil wound on a coil bobbin (18); and shielding device (16) for 

preventing the magnetic flux of the primary coil from flowing 
into the cylinder device body, the shielding device being 

arranged between the coil mounting portion and the primary 
coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a key-operated cylinder 
device which is so designed that a primary coil is mounted on 
the front end portion of the cylinder device body into which 
the key is inserted. Recently, some automobiles have been provided with a 
so-called "wireless door lock device. The wireless door lock 
device is generally designed as follows: A signal transmitting 
circuit, and a power source, namely, a battery for the signal 
transmitting circuit are provided on the base of the key which 
is inserted not only into a key-operated cylinder device for 
ignition but also into a key-operated cylinder device for door, 
namely, a key-operated cylinder lock. The user operates the 
signal transmitting circuit to transmit a predetermined radio 
wave signal. The radio wave signal thus transmitted is 
received by a receiver provided on the vehicle, so that it is 
decoded by signal discriminating means. When it is determined 
that the signal is for the lock, an motor actuator is operated 
to automatically lock or unlock the door. If, in the above-described wireless door lock device, 
the battery provided on the key is consumed up, then it becomes 
impossible to transmit the signal any longer; that is, it  
 
becomes impossible to automatically lock or unlock the door 
with the signal. In order to overcome the above-described difficulty, 
the following key-operated cylinder device for ignition is 
proposed: A primary coil is provided on the side of the key-operated 
cylinder device for ignition. A secondary cell, which 
can be charged, is employed as the battery on the key, and a 
secondary coil is provided on the key. When the key inserted 
into the key-operated cylinder device is turned, the engine is 
started, so that the primary coil is energized. As the current 
in the primary coil changes, an electromotive force is induced 
in the secondary coil on the key, to charge the secondary cell. That is, with the device, the secondary cell on the key 
can be charged during the operation of the engine. However, the above-described device is disadvantageous 
in the following point: When the primary coil is energized, 
the magnetic flux produced by the latter acts on the rotor 
casing and the metal rotor of the cylinder device body which 
are made of metal, or on the cylinder device body, thus forming 
eddy currents therein. As a result, the output of the primary 
coil is lowered. In view of the foregoing, an object of the invention is 
to provide a key-operated cylinder device having a primary coil  
 
in the
