<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an absorbent article such
as a diaper, sanitary napkin, or the like which can prevent a

rash in the wearer, as well as a barrier agent to be applied to
the surface of an absorbent article when such an absorbent

article is produced. The barrier agent for an absorbent article
is characterized by comprising an oil soluble antioxidant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent article
such as a diaper, sanitary napkin, or the like which can reduce
dermatitis (rash) brought when such an absorbent article is
worn, and to a barrier agent to be applied to the surface of
the absorbent article. More specifically, the present invention
relates to an absorbent article such as a diaper, sanitary
napkin, or the like which can prevent contact-type dermatitis
(rash) from being produced due to chemical stimulation from
body fluids such as feces, urine, menstrual bleeding, and the
like or due to physical stimulation of the skin by friction
with respect to the surface materials of the absorbent article
when such an absorbent article is worn, and to a barrier agent
to be applied to the surface of the absorbent article for the
said purpose.A problem with an absorbent article such as a diaper,
sanitary napkin, or the like is dermatitis produced by
attachment of feces, urine, menstrual bleeding, and the like to
the skin, or stimulation of the skin by chemicals such as a
surfactant used for improving the surface properties of the
absorbent article, or contact-type dermatitis produced by a
physical stimulation of the skin due to friction between the
skin and the surface material of the absorbent article.In addition, a synergistic action of these chemical and
physical stimulators increases stimulation of the skin and
swells the skin, resulting in an increase in the coefficient of 
friction between the surface material of the absorbent article
and the skin.In order to prevent such contact dermatitis (rash), it is
important to thoroughly wipe off body fluids attached to the
skin when an absorbent article is replaced, thereby maintaining
the skin clean. However, it is impossible to completely avoid
contact of body fluids with the skin which may occur during the
period after a body fluid has become attached to the skin and
before the absorbent article is replaced. The effort of
frequently replacing the absorbent article can shorten the
period of time during which the body fluids are in contact with
the skin. However, there is a limitation to the number of times
of replacement.One method for preventing contact dermatitis is to apply
a cream, oil, or the like to the skin of the wearer such as an
infant. Although it is possible to apply a cream, oil, or the
like to the buttocks or the anal region of the wearer when the
diaper is replaced, application of such an agent each time the
diaper is replaced is not only troublesome, but also may create
a problem
