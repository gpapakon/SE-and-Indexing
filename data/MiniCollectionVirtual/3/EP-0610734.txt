<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of rigid, very substantially open-celled foams containing urethane and/or isocyanurate groups by reacting polyisocyanates with compounds containing at least two isocyanate-reactive groups whose equivalent weight is from about 9 to 800 per reactive group, in the presence of catalysts, surfactants and optionally physical blowing agents, flameproofing agents and other known auxiliaries and finishes, the reaction being carried out in the presence of liquid, relatively high-molecular-weight, unsaturated hydrocarbons which are free from isocyanate-reactive groups, in amounts of from 0.01 to 3.0% by weight, based on the reaction batch. Particularly preferred hydrocarbons are polybutadiene and polyoctenylene having a mean molecular weight of from 800 to 10,000 g/ mol. The rigid foams have high dimensional stability due to the predominance of open cells.

<CLAIMS>
Use of liquid, unsaturated hydrocarbons having a mean 
molecular weight of from 800 to 10,000 g/mol, which are 

free of groups reactive towards isocyanates, as cell 
op
eners for producing rigid foams containing urethane 
and/or isocyanurate groups and at least 30 % of open 

cells, by reacting polyisocyanates with compounds 
containing at least two groups reactive towards isocyanates 

and having an equivalent weight per reactive 
group of from 9 to 800, in the presence of catalysts, 

surface-active substances and, if desired, physical 
blowing agents, flame retardants and further known 

auxiliaries and additives, wherein the reaction is 
carried out in the presence of from 0.01 to 3.0 %, based 

on the reaction mixture, of the above hydrocarbons.
