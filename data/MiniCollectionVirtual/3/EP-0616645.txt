<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to host cells expressing one or
more prohormone convertase enzymes and the production of a
biologically active polypeptide from these cells. The
invention further relates to polypeptide precursor variants
having endoprotease cleavage sites which are processed by
the host cell.Most, if not all proteinaceous hormones are
synthesized as relatively large precursor molecules,
prohormones, that are biologically inactive (reviewed in
Docherty and Steiner 1982; Loh et al. 1984; Mains et al.
1990). Maturation of the prohormone to its active form
often requires endoproteolytic cleavage at paired or
multiple basic amino acid residues to liberate the active
component from the inactive portion of the precursor
molecule. Until recently, almost nothing was known
concerning the identity of the proteins responsible for
this important stage in processing: the prohormone
convertase (PC) enzymes.Not every kind of cell has the capacity to correctly
convert a prohormone to its active mature form through
these specific cleavages. For some classes of prohormone
this processing is apparently limited to those cells that
contain both constitutive and regulated pathways of protein
secretion (Gumbiner and Kelly 1982). Cells having both
constitutive and regulated pathways of protein secretion
are located almost exclusively in the specialized hormone-producing
tissues of the endocrine and neuroendocrine
systems.An example of a family of hormones that is processed
during regulated secretion is the insulin family of
hormones. This family includes insulin, the insulin-like
growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II, and relaxin. In their 
native environment, all members of this family are
synthesized as precursor molecules that require processing
to yield active hormone.When heterologously expressed in cells having only a
constitutive pathway of protein secretion, most hormone
precursors, such as human preproinsulin, are secreted in an
unprocessed prohormone form (Gumbiner and Kelly 1982).
Experimental manipulation of mouse AtT-20 cells that
disrupted the regulated secretory pathway of those cells
has been observed to redirect the polyhormone precursor
proopiomelanocortin (POMC) into the constitutive secretory
pathway. In that case, POMC was no longer subjected to
processing and was found to be secreted from the cell as
the intact precursor (Moore et al. 1983). These
observations suggest that there is a class of processing
enzymes that function only in the regulated pathway of
protein secretion; this pathway is apparently
