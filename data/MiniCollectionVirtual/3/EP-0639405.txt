<ABSTRACT>
Device for supporting and protecting (1) a tubular component (2) of very small diameter, especially of the type which has a micropipette comprising a nominal part of uniform diameter and a tapered end (3). According to the invention this device is characterised in that it consists of a single-block article made of a material exhibiting a relative elasticity, comprising an elongate body (4) the size of which in its lengthwise direction is at least equal to the length of the tubular component (2) to be supported and whose cross-section is appreciably in the form of an inverted U with a base (5) extended by two arms (6, 7), the base of the U comprising on its outer, planar face at least two housings (9, 10) which are open outwards and arranged in the extension of one another while being separated by a distance smaller than the length of the tubular component so as to receive the latter by supporting it in two regions set apart, each of these housings being bounded by two parallel edges (11, 12) extending from the base of the U.

A device for the support and protection (1) of a
tubular element (2) having a very small diameter,

notably like a micropipette for taking a sample, for
injection or contention, with a constant diameter

nominal part and a tapered end (3), characterized in
that it consists of an integral part made of a material

having an elasticity, with an elongated body (4) whose
longitudinal dimension is at least equal to the length

of the tubular element (2) to be supported, and whose
straight section through a plane which is perpendicular

to this longitudinal direction has approximately the
shape of an inverted U with a central base (5)

prolonged with two side branches (6, 7) nearly parallel
to one another, wherein the base of the U contains in

its outer surface, which is preferably plane, at least
two housings (9, 10) which open towards the outside ,

and which originate from the production process with
the body (4) of the support, and which prolong one

another while being separated by a distance which is
less than the length of the tubular element, so as to

house the latter by supporting it in two spaced apart
areas, wherein each of these housings is delimitated

with two parallel sides (11, 12) which extend from the
base of the U, are approximately perpendicular to it

and parallel to the longitudinal direction of the body.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the material which makes up the body (4) of the support

is a plastic material.
A device according to any of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the material which makes up the

body (4) of the support is polyethylene, polyvinyl
chloride or polypropylene. 
A device according to any of claims 1-3,
characterized in that the sides of the U base, in line

with its side branches (6, 7) include, opposite the
housings (9, 10) and spaced apart from the edges of the

latter, extensions (14, 15 - 16, 17) that prolong these
branches so as to perfect the protection of the tubular

element which is placed in these housings.
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that
the height of these extensions is greater than that of

the edges (11, 12) of the housings.
A device according to any of claims 4-5,
characterized in that the body (4) of the support has

in its central part, between the two housings (9, 10)
which receive the tubular element (2), an indentation

(18) arranged in its side branches between the
extensions (14, 15 - 16, 17).
