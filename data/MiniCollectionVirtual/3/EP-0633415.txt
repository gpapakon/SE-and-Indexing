<ABSTRACT>
Known electromagnetic switch valves have a large iron-free gap in the magnetic circuit, the magnet armature being arranged in a fluid passage. In contrast, the new switch valve has the features that the passage (10) and the magnet armature (9) are matched in diameter in such a way that there is only a very small gap between them, that the magnet armature (9) has a recess (15) which runs in the longitudinal direction and into which is inserted a plastic body (16) which has two elastomer sealing bodies (18, 19) in its central part (17), the central part (17) being connected by ribs (20) to an outer part (21), giving rise to passages (22) in the plastic body (16). It is thereby possible to increase the range of applications of the switch valve or reduce the magnet coil (3) in size and in its number of turns.

Electromagnetic changeover valve (1) with a 
magnet armature (9) which is movably arranged in a 

through-channel (10) and forms valve-closing elements for 
two connection channels (11, 12) which each form a valve 

seat (13, 14) for the valve-closing elements, the 
through-channel and the magnet armature being matched in 

terms of diameter in such a way that there is only an 
extremely small gap between them and the magnet armature 

has a plurality of passages (22) running in the longitudinal 
direction, and the magnet armature (9) having a 

recess (15) which runs in the longitudinal direction and 
into which a plastic element (16) is inserted, characterized 

in that the plastic element has in its central 
part (17) two elastomer sealing elements (18, 19) which 

project out at its two end faces, the central part (17) 
being connected to an outer part (21) by means of ribs 

(20) between which the passages (22) are located, the 
outer part (21) being received in the recess (15), and 

the through-channel (10) being bounded by an armature 
core (7) which has the connection channel (12).
