<DESCRIPTION>
USE OF APOMORPHINE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF A MEDICAMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF ORGANIC ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN MALESTechnical FieldThis invention relates to medical methods of treatment. More particularly, the invention concerns the use of apomorphine for the treatment of organic erectile dysfunction in males, particularly vasculogenic erectile dysfunction.Background of the Invention In the medical literature the less precise term, "impotence" has been replaced by the term "erectile dysfunction." This term has been defined by the National Institutes of Health as the inability of the male to attain and maintain erection of the penis sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 270(l):83-90 (1993). Because adequate arterial blood supply is critical for erection, any disorder that impairs blood flow may be implicated in the etiology of erectile failure. Erectile dysfunction affects millions of men and, although generally regarded as a benign disorder, has a profound impact on their quality of life. It is recognized, however, that in many men psychological desire, orgasmic capacity, and ejaculatory capacity are intact even in the presence of erectile dysfunction.Etiological factors for erectile disorders have been categorized as psychogenic or organic in origin. Organic factors include those of a neurogenic origin and those of a vasculogenic origin. Neurogenic factors include, for example, lesions of the somatic nervous pathways which may impair reflexogenic erections and interrupt tactile sensations needed to maintain erections, and spinal cord lesions which, depending upon their location and severity, may produce varying degrees of erectile failure.Psychogenic factors for erectile dysfunction include such processes as depression, anxiety, and relationship problems which can impair erectile functioning by reducing erotic focus or otherwise reducing awareness of sensory experience. This may lead to an inability to initiate or maintain an erection. 

 Vasculogenic risk factors include factors which affect blood flow and include cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, vascular disease, high levels of serum cholesterol, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and other chronic disease conditions such as arthritis. The Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS, as repoited by H. A. Feldman, et al, J. Urol.. 151: 54-61 (1994) found, for example, that the age- adjusted probability of complete erectile dysfunction was three times greater in subjects reporting treated diabetes

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of treating organic erectile dysfunction in a male comprising administering to a male in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of apomoφhine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or pro-drag thereof.
2. The method of Claim 1 wherein said organic erectile dysfunction is vasculogenic in origin relating to a disease of the cardiovascular system.
3. The method of Claim 1 wherein said organic erectile dysfunction is vasculogenic in origin relating to a risk factor associated with a disease of the cardiovascular system.
4. The method of Claim 2 wherein said disease of the cardiovascular system is myocardial infarction, heart disease, or peripheral vascular disease.
5. The method of Claim 2 wherein said disease of the cardiovascular system is impaired circulation associated with diabetes, cardiac bypass surgery, cerebral vascular trauma, or cigarette smoking.
6. The method of Claim 3 wherein said risk factor associated with a disease of the cardiovascular system is hypertension, elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and low serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
7. The method of Claim 1 wherein said apomoφhine is administered in an amount sufficient to produce an effective penile erection in said male, but insufficient to induce nausea.
8. The method of Claim 1 wherein said apomoφhine is co-administered with an 


 emesis inhibitory effective amount of an anti-emetic agent.
9. The method of Claim 1 wherein said apomoφhine is administered in an amount between about 25 micrograms/kg of body weight and about 60 micrograms/kg of body weight.
10. The method of Claim 1 wherein said apomoφhine is administered in an amount sufficient to establish plasma concentration levels of apomoφhine ranging between about 0.3 to about 5.5 nanograms/mL.
11. The method of Claim 10 wherein said plasma levels of apomoφhine range between about 0.3 and about 4 nanograms/mL.
12. The method of Claim 11 wherein said plasma levels of apomoφhine range between about 1 and about 2 nanograms/mL.
13. The method of Claim 8 wherein said anti-emetic agent is selected from the group consisting of nicotine, lobeline sulfate, metoclopramide, chloφromazine, prochloφerazine, pipamazine, thiethylperazine, oxypendyl hydrochloride, domperidone, ondansetron, buclizine hydrochloride, cyclizine hydrochloride, dimenhydrinate,scopolamine, metopimazine, trimethobenzamide, benzauinamine hydrochloride, and diphenidol hydrochloride.
14. A method of treating erectile dysfunction in a hypertensive male comprising administering to a male in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of apomoφhine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or pro-drag thereof.
15. The method of Claim 14 wherein said apomoφhine is co-administered with an emesis inhibitory effective amount of an anti-emetic agent. 

16. The method of Claim 14 wherein said apomoφhine is administered in an amount between about 25 micrograms/kg of body weight and about 60 micrograms/kg of body weight.
17. The method of Claim 14 wherein said apomoφhine is administered in an amount sufficient to establish plasma concentration levels of apomoφhine ranging between about 0.3 to about 5.5 nanograms/mL.
18. The method of Claim 17 wherein said plasma levels of apomoφhine range between about 0.3 and about 4 nanograms/mL.
19. The method of Claim 18 wherein said plasma levels of apomoφhine range between about 1 and about 2 nanograms/mL.
20. The method of Claim 15 wherein said anti-emetic agent is selected from the group consisting of nicotine, lobeline sulfate, metoclopramide, chloφromazine, prochloφerazine, pipamazine, thiethylperazine, oxypendyl hydrochloride, domperidone, ondansetron, buclizine hydrochloride, cyclizine hydrochloride, dimenhydrinate,scopolamine, metopimazine, trimethobenzamide, benzauinamine hydrochloride, and diphenidol hydrochloride.
