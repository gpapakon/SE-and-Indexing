<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the separation of tobacco fibres within the distributor of a cigarette-strand machine. The object is to carry out the separation effectively and in a way which treats the tobacco carefully. This is achieved within a falling shaft (8) of the distributor, into which the tobacco (7) is transferred in a manner accelerated downwards in a main flightpath (41). Provided in the falling shaft (8) limited by mutually opposite channel walls (42, 43) are alternately offset air slits (44, 46), through which blowing air is directed essentially transversely to the flightpath (41) towards the tobacco flying downwards, with the result that the latter is alternately deflected laterally out of its flightpath. The lateral deflection is advantageously associated with a loosening and separation of the tobacco fibres which have an advantageous effect on the quality of the finished cigarettes.

Method for separating tobacco or suchlike fibres moving on
channelled flight paths and impinged substantially transversely

to the moving direction by blast air, characterized in that the
tobacco fibres are impinged along their flight path alternately

from opposite sides by the blast air guided with one component
in the moving direction of the tobacco fibres.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
tobacco fibres are impinged by the blast air at locations,

opposite in an alternately offset manner, of the sides bounding
the flight paths.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
flight paths extend in the substantially vertical falling

direction of the tobacco fibres.
Apparatus for separating tobacco or suchlike fibres conveyed
by an accelerating means into flight paths bounded by channel

walls, characterized by blast-air openings (44, 46) emerging
along the flight path (41) of the tobacco fibres alternately at

opposite channel walls (42 and 43, respectively) and oriented
substantially transversely to the flight path and with one

component in the flying direction of the tobacco fibres,
respectively.
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in that the
blast-air openings (44, 46) are arranged at locations, opposite

in an alternately offset manner, of the channel walls (42, 43).
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that
the blast-air openings (44, 46) are configured as slits extending

over the width of the channel walls (42, 43). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 4 to 6, characterized
in that the channel walls (42, 43) bound a substantially vertical

falling shaft (8) for the tobacco fibres.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 4 to 7, characterized
in that the blast-air openings (44, 46) are assigned to injection

boxes (47 and 48, respectively) integrated in the channel walls
(42, 43).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 4 to 8, characterized
in that the accelerating means is a rotating beater roller (6)

cooperating with a removal roller (4) removing tobacco from a
storage shaft (1).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 4 to 9, characterized
in that the falling shaft (8) opens, at the lower end, into a

classifying device (9) transferring tobacco fibres (13) into a
rod-building zone (28) by means of a transverse air current (16).
