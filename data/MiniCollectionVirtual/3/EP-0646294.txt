<ABSTRACT>
A cable sealing device, which comprises: (a) a housing into which the cable passes; (b) a seal that seals a gap between the housing and the cable, which seal comprises a sealing material between first and second means for axially locating the sealing material. The housing having a cavity within which the seal can slide axially inwardly and outwardly with respect to the housing in response respectively to excess external and excess internal pressure, and having first and second step means which can engage respectively the first and second means for locating thereby restricting the axial sliding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an article for forming a cable 
seal, in particular for forming a ready access butt closure or an in-line 
closure for a telecommunications or other cable splice. It may 
however be used for forming a cable feedthrough. Cable splices have to be sealed against the environment to 
prevent damage to the cable conductors and connectors joining them. 
When a cable splice is made, cable jacket is stripped back from the 
ends of the cables to be spliced to expose the conductors to be 
connected. After the splice is made a so-called splice case, or splice 
closure, is built up around the splice. In certain instances it is desirable for the splice to be of butt, 
rather than in-line configuration. This means that two or more 
cables lying side-by-side with their ends pointing in the same 
direction are spliced together. An advantage is that a housing 
comprising a domed cover can be slid over the resulting splice. A 
single seal then has to be made where the cables leave an outlet of 
the housing. In the case of an in-line splice (made between ends of 
cables that face one another) two seals need to be made. one at each 
end of a generally cylindrical housing that surrounds the splice. 
Also, the housing of a butt closure need not be of the wrap-around 
type and can still be removed. Various cable splice closures have been proposed in the past, a 
few of which will be reviewed below. US 4194082 (Campbell) disclosed a generally dome-shaped 
closure having a heat-shrinkable end that is shrunk down around an 
ingoing cable. As a result of heat-shrinkage, a seal is made around 
the cable, isolating the inside of the closure from the environment.  
 WO 90/05401 (Raychem) discloses an in-line splice closure that 
can avoid the use of heat-shrinkable materials. A sealing material, 
for example a gel, is provided as part of end seals that seal gaps 
between in-going and out-going cables of a splice case, a central part 
of which comprises a generally cylindrical housing. The end seals 
comprise the gel between structures that can be brought together to 
deform the gel to seal it to the cables and the central housing. US 4701574 (Shimirak et al) also discloses a closure which 
includes a cable end seal and a central generally cylindrical housing. 
The end seals have an outer convoluted surface that mates with a 
convoluted surface of the cylindrical housing. In this way the end 
seals are retained in appropriate positions at the ends of the housing. US 3984623 (Worden) discloses a cable

<CLAIMS>
A cable sealing device (1), which comprises: 

(a) a housing (3, 4) into which the cable (2) passes; 
(b) a seal that seals a gap between the housing and the cable, which seal 
comprises a sealing material (10) between first and second means (11) 

for axially locating the sealing material; 
 
characterised by the housing (3, 4) having a cavity within which the seal can 

slide axially inwardly and outwardly with respect to the housing in response 
respectively to excess external and excess internal pressure, and having first 

and second stop means (17A, 17B) which can engage respectively the first and 
second means (11) for locating thereby restricting the axial sliding. 
A device (1) according to claim 1, comprising an in-line cable splice closure, 
the housing having a seal (b) adjacent one end thereof. 
A device (1) according to claim 1, comprising a butt splice closure, the 
housing (3, 4) having a seal (b) adjacent one end thereof and being blind at an 

opposite end thereof. 
A device (1) according to claim 3, in which the housing (3, 4) comprises a base 
(3) and a cover (4) therefor, the base receiving the seal (b). 
A device (1) according to any preceding claim, being a device for sealing a 
plurality of cables (2), the seal having therethrough respective holes for each 

cable.  
 
A device (1) according to any preceding claim, in which the first and second 
means (11) for locating can be brought towards one another to cause axial 

compression of the sealing material (10). 
A device (1) according to any preceding claim, in which the sealing material 
(10) comprises a gel. 
A device (1) according to any preceding claim, in which the sealing material 
(10) has a cone penetration, measured in accordance with ASTM D217, from 

30-400 (10
-1
mm) and/or an ultimate elongation, measured in accordance with 
ASTM D412 greater than 100%. 
A device (1) according to any preceding claim, in which the sealing material 
(10) has a passage therethrough for the cable (2), the passage extending to an 

outer surface of the material, allowing the material to be wrapped around the 
cable.
