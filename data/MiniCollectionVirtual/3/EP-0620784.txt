Rotary printing machine with a printing cylinder 
(1) which can be pressed relative to a impression 

cylinder (4) and which is provided with an inking 
apparatus (9) for conveying printing ink onto its 

surface characterised in that the printing cylinder (1) 
lies on at least one tensioned flexible band (6), with 

the printing ink being conveyed into the gap (8) 
between the band (6) and the printing cylinder (1) and 

being distributed over the surface of the printing 
cylinder (1) at its surface of contact with the band 

(6) during rotation of the printing cylinder (1), with 
a hydraulic lubrication of the bearing of the printing 

cylinder (1) simultaneously being formed on the band 
(6). 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with claim 1 
characterised in that the flexible band (6) extends 

over the entire breadth of the printing cylinder (1). 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with claim 1 
characterised in that a plurality of flexible bands 

(26, 36, 46) are provided side by side over the breadth 
of the printing cylinder (1). 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with one of 
the claims 1 - 3 characterised in that the printing ink 

is brought into the inlet gap (8) between the band (6) 
and the printing cylinder (1) and thus forms a 

hydrodynamic bearing for the printing cylinder (1) on 
the band (6).  

 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with one of 
the claims 1 - 3 characterised in that the band (6) is 

provided with at least one hydrostatic storage pocket 
(15) into which the printing ink is fed under pressure 

and which thus forms a hydrostatic bearing for the 
printing cylinder (1) on the band (6). 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with one of 
the claims 1 - 5 characterised in that the effective 

length of the band (6) is capable of being changed. 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with claim 6 
characterised in that the band is fastened to a drum 

(12) which can be wound up. 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with one of 
the claims 1 - 7 characterised in that the band is 

fastened to a cradle (25) displaceable within a frame 
(5) in the pressing direction by means of a pressing 

force. 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with one of 
the claims 1 - 4 characterised in that the band (6) is 

an endless band guided over a plurality of deflection 
rollers (50, 51, 52). 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with claim 9 
characterised in that the band (6) is moved over the 

deflection rollers (50, 51, 52) relative to the surface 
of the printing cylinder (1).  

 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with claim 9 
characterised in that the band is moved with at least 

approximately the same speed and in the same direction 
as the surface of the printing cylinder (1). 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with one of 
the claims 9 - 11 characterised in that the position of 

the axis of at least one of the deflection rollers (50, 
51, 52) can be varied spatially. 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with one of 
the claims 1 - 12 characterised in that the printing 

cylinder (1) has bearings (2) at its ends which are 
provided with an apparatus (10) for measuring the 

bearing force. 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with claim 13 
characterised in that the force measuring apparatus 

(10) is capable of controlling the length of the band 
(6) and/or the press force for the cradle (25) in the 

frame (5) and/or the position of at least one of the 
deflection rollers (50, 51, 52) in such a manner that 

the load on the end bearings of the printing cylinder 
is decreased. 
Rotary printing machine in accordance with one of 
the claims 1 - 14 characterised in that the band (6) 

performs an oscillatory movement (C) in the axial 
direction of the printing cylinder (1) with respect to 

the latter.
