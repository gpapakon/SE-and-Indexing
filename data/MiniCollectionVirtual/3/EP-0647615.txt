<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 5-fluoroanthranilic acid alkyl esters and/or 5-fluoroanthranilic acid by dissolving a 3-fluorobenzoic acid alkyl ester in sulphuric acid and reacting with nitrating acid at -10 to 30 DEG C, then adding water, separating off the nitrated reaction product and reacting with hydrogen at 50 to 120 DEG C at elevated pressure in the presence of a catalyst containing a metal of the platinum group and sulphur and optionally separating off 5-fluoroanthranilic acid alkyl esters by distillation and subjecting to alkaline hydrolysis to give 5-fluoroanthranilic acid.
