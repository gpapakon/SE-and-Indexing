<ABSTRACT>
This gear box, the construction of which is derived from that of motor cycle gear boxes, comprises members according to the invention making it possible to adapt it, especially for a car. The selector shaft (10) which changes the gear ratios by means of forks (29, 30, 31) can be uncoupled from these forks by virtue of an uncoupling shaft (11) which releases the cam followers secured to the forks from their respective cams provided on the selector shaft (10).   Any change in gear ratio can thus be selected without having to pass through the intermediate ratios.

<CLAIMS>
Gearbox comprising : 

a primary shaft (8) intended to be coupled to a 
power supply (3, 6); 
a secondary shaft (9) intended to be coupled to a 
power outlet (4, 5); 
a plurality of sets of gearwheels mounted on said 
primary (8) and secondary (9) shafts, said sets of gearwheels 

being able to be selectively meshed to establish a 
plurality of transmission ratios between said supply (3, 6) 

and said outlet (4, 5); 
said sets of gearwheels comprising a plurality of 
switching gearwheels (26, 27, 28) for said ratios, these 

gearwheels being mounted so as to move axially on said 
shafts (8, 9) to enable said ratios to be established; 
selection means (10 to 13; 29, 30, 31; 35. 36, 37; 
42, 43, 44) coupled to said switching gearwheels (26, 27, 

28) to cause them to make the appropriate axial movements 
according to the desired transmission ratio; 
said selection means (10, 12, 13) comprising a 
ratio selector shaft (10) rotationally mounted so as to be 

able to have at least as many selection positions as there 
are possible transmission ratios, said selector shaft (10) 

being therefore provided with cam forming means (35, 36, 37) 
coupled to said switching gearwheels (26, 27, 28) through 

the intermediary of counter-cam forming means (42, 43, 44); 
said gearbox being characterized in that it also 
comprises 
decoupling means (11, 12, 13; 56, 57, 58) for 
selectively disabling the coupling between each cam forming 

means (35, 36, 37) and each counter-cam forming means (42, 
43, 44) associated with it, in order to
 enable the free 
rotation of said selector shaft (10) towards any ratio 

selection position, whatever the previously selected 
transmission ratio. 
Gearbox according to claim 1 characterized in that 
it also comprises motor means (12, 13) to ensure automatic 

control of said selector shaft (10) and said decoupling 
means (11, 12, 13; 56, 57, 58). 
Gearbox according to any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that said decoupling means comprise a 

decoupling shaft (11) rotationally mounted parallel to said 
selector shaft (10), such decoupling shaft being equipped 

with at least one cam (56, 57, 58) per counter-cam forming 
means (42, 43, 44) which said selector shaft (10) has, each 

of said decoupling cams (56, 57, 58) being mounted in such a 
way that they are able to disengage said counter-cam forming 

means (42, 43, 44) from its associated cam forming means 
(35, 36, 37). 
Gearbox according to claim 3, characterized in that 
said decoupling shaft (11) is provided with means for 

controlling the shift into reverse (88, 89), the gearbox (1) 
also comprising reverse gearwheels (MA, 94) used with said 

primary (8) and secondary (9) shafts and reverse switching 
gearwheels (93) mounted so as to be able to be controlled by 

said reverse shift control means (88, 89). 
Gearbox according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said cam forming means are 

annular grooves (35, 36, 37) of predetermined profile 
arranged in the peripheral surface of said selector shaft 

(10). 
Gearbox acording to claim 5, characterized in that 
each of the switching gearwheels (26, 27, 28) is intended to 

engage two transmission ratios, in that it is therefore 
mounted so as to move axially in both directions, 

respectively on the primary (8) and secondary (9) shafts, 
and in that each cam groove (35, 36, 37) of said selector 

shaft (10) comprises two deviation portions (35b, 36b, 37b) 
extending in opposite axial directions, such deviations 

enabling the corresponding gearwheels to be placed in each 
of its ratio engaging positions.  

 
Gearbox according to claim 6, characterized in that 
it comprises six transmission ratios and in that all the 

deviation portions are staggered in relation to each other 
at an angle of 60째. 
Gearbox according to any one of claims 4 to 7, when 
they depend upon claims 1 to 3 taken together, characterized 

in that said motor means comprise a single driving motor 
(13) at the shaft outlet of which are connected two 

electromagnetically controlled coupling mechanisms (60, 63, 
69; 60a, 63a, 69a) enabling the selective coupling of the 

selector shaft (10) and the decoupling shaft (11) to the 
outlet shaft of said single motor (13) to enable them to be 

placed in predetermined angular positions. 
Gearbox according to any one of claims 3 to 8, 
characterized in that said decoupling shaft (11) comprises, 

for each of said counter-cams (42, 43, 44), at least one cam

position and defining by its point a first position (0째) in 
which these cams maintain said counter-cams (42, 43, 44) in 

their engaged position with the selector shaft (10), said 
ovoid-shaped cams defining by their profile two other 

angular positions (120째 and 260째) of said decoupling shaft, 
in one of which said counter-cams are withdrawn from their 

engaged position with the selector shaft (10) and the other 
in which reverse gear is engaged.
