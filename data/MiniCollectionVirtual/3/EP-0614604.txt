<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a haymaking machine comprising, in particular, a structure which carries at least one rotor rotating about a substantially vertical axis which is fitted, at its end which points downwards, with one or more pairs of wheels, each pair being fixed on a rocker arm which can rotate in limited manner about a substantially horizontal axis. It is noteworthy in that each rocker arm (26) is in addition articulated with respect to the rotational shaft (6) of the rotor (4), corresponding to at least one substantially vertical axis (22) which lies between two planes respectively passing through the axis of the foremost wheel (29) and through the said substantially horizontal axis (25).

Haymaking machine including especially a carrying structure which can be 
connected to a tractor, which structure carries at least one rotor rotating 

about a substantially vertical axis which is equipped, at its downwards-pointing 
end, with one or more pairs of wheels, each pair being fixed to a 

rocking beam which can rotate in limited way about a substantially 
horizontal axis, 
characterized in
 that each rocking beam (26, 48, 57, 71) is 
additionally articulated with respect to the axis of rotation (6, 41, 66, 85) of 

the corresponding rotor (4, 39) by means of a substantially vertical axis (22, 
45, 64, 73) which is situated between two planes (P and P') passing 

respectively through the axis (31, 88, 89, 83) of the furthest-forward wheel 
(29, 49, 55, 69) and through the said substantially horizontal axis (25, 47, 58, 

76). 
Machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that each rocking beam (26, 
48, 57) is articulated by means of its substantially horizontal axis (25, 47, 

58) to an inclined arm (21, 46, 59) which is itself articulated by means of the 
substantially vertical axis (22, 45, 64) on a support (18, 44, 65) fastened to 

the axis of rotation (6, 41, 66) of the corresponding rotor (4, 39). 
Machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that the position of the 
substantially horizontal articulation axis (58) and of the rocking beam (57) is 

adjustable with respect to the inclined arm (59). 
Machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the rocking beam (71) 
is connected to an arm (72) equipped with the substantially vertical axis (73) 

by means of two levers (74 and 75) which are arranged in such a way that 
the substantially horizontal axis of rotation (76) of the rocking beam (71) is 

an imaginary axis which is situated close to the surface of the ground.  
 
Machine according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the arm (72) equipped 
with the substantially vertical axis is substantially horizontal. 
Machine according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in
 that the levers (74 and 
75) are articulated to the arm (72) equipped with the substantially vertical 

axis and to the rocking beam (71) by means of substantially horizontal axes 
(77 to 80). 
Machine according to Claim 4 or 6, 
characterized in
 that the two levers (74 
and 75) point obliquely downwards in such a way that, if their geometric 

axes (81 and 82) are extended, these intersect close to the surface of the 
ground. 
Machine according to Claim 2 or 4, 
characterized in
 that the substantially 
vertical axis (22, 45, 64, 73) of the arm (21, 46, 59, 72) is situated, viewed 

from above, substantially on a line (L) passing through the middle of the 
areas where the two wheels (29, 30, 49, 50, 55, 56, 69, 70) of the same 

rocking beam (26, 48, 57, 71) rest on the ground. 
Machine according to Claim 2, 4 or 8, 
characterized in
 that the support (18, 
44, 65, 84) includes a stop (34, 54, 67, 86) to limit the pivoting of the arm 

(21, 46, 59, 72) about its substantially vertical axis (22, 45, 64, 73).
