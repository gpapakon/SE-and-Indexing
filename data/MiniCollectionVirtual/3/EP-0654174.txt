<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of manufacturing an electrically conductive feedthrough in an article having a ceramic surface comprising the steps of inserting a feedthrough preform into and closely fitting an insertion hole in the article, said preform integrally comprising an outer surface comprising at least in part an active alloy capable of reacting with an inner surface of said insertion hole to wet said inner surface and form a braze and then heating and cooling said article and said feedthrough preform to form a braze sealing said feedthrough to said article. Also disclosed are feedthrough preforms comprising either an active alloy wire or a composite wire having a core and an outer layer of an active alloy. The invention further comprises fixing a non-melting electrical conductor to either feedthrough preform during the brazing step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to feedthroughs and to wires
usable for forming such feedthroughs. More particularly, the
invention relates to sealed conductive active alloy
feedthroughs for use in articles having a ceramic surface.Feedthroughs comprise a conductive path (the feedthrough)
passing via a hole (the feedthrough aperture) through a wall
in an article. Metallic feedthroughs (e.g., electrodes) are
well known in industry and are commonly used to provide
electrically conductive paths through ceramic articles while
excluding the passage of solids, liquids, and gases. One
application for such feedthroughs is in magnetic inductive
field flow meters which require a chemically inert electrode
hermetically sealed in the wall of an electrical insulating
and chemically resistant ceramic cylinder. Feedthroughs are
also used to carry electrical power to/from an active device
such as a transistor or diode.Various commercial methods have been employed to produce
metallic feedthroughs. Typically, with alumina ceramics, the
feedthroughs (i.e., metallic conductors) are brazed in place
using a multi-step process described in the following with
reference to FIG. 1 of the drawings. A ceramic article 1 has
an ceramic electrode insertion hole 2 forming a feedthrough
aperture which is metallised by coating with a moly-manganese
or tungsten paint 3 and sintered at approximately. 1,500°C in
wet hydrogen. The inside diameter of the coated insertion
hole 2 is then nickel plated 4 and sintered at approximately.
950°C (this step is known as metallisation plating). The
metallic conductor 5 is inserted in the electrode insertion
hole 2 with a brazing alloy preform 6 or a paste positioned on
the top side to fill voids at the interface of the conductor 5
and the insertion hole 2 upon brazing. The ceramic article 1
and conductor 5 are then simultaneously heated to effectuate
brazing of the conductor 5. A major drawback of this method
is that, in most instances, the conductor 5 is placed in a
vertical position during brazing to avoid migration of the
brazing alloy or paste (disposed on the top side of the
conductor 5) from regions of the interface under the influence
of gravity. This multi-step operation is also very time
consuming and expensive. In U.S. Patent No. 5,095,759 a method is disclosed
wherein a core wire (e.g., platinum) 9, coated with an active
alloy paste 7, is inserted into a pre-sintered ceramic
insertion hole 8 forming a feedthrough aperture (See FIG 2. of
the drawings). The ceramic article 10 and the wire 9 are then
sim

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing an electrically conductive feedthrough in an
article having a ceramic surface comprising the steps of:-


i) inserting a closely fitting feedthrough preform member into a
predetermined insertion hole having a ceramic surface and forming a

feedthrough aperture in the article, said preform member comprising a wire
consisting of an active alloy capable of reacting with the ceramic inner surface of

said insertion hole to wet said inner surface and form a braze;
ii) heating said article and said feedthrough preform member for a
predetermined time and at a predetermined temperature to achieve a

brazing reaction at the interface between said inner surface of said
insertion hole of said article and said outer surface of said feedthrough

preform member;

and,
iii) cooling said article and said feedthrough preform member to form a braze
sealing said feedthrough preform member to said article to form a

feedthrough.
A method as claimed in claim 1 including the step of placing an electrical
conductor at an end of said feedthrough preform member prior to heating and

cooling whereby subsequent to said heating and cooling said conductor is
effectively fixed to said feedthrough.
A method as claimed in Claim 2 wherein an active brazing alloy paste is
placed around said electrical conductor prior to said heating and cooling to

enhance the sealing of said feedthrough and the mechanical bond of said
electrical conductor to said feedthrough.
