<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the recovery of alumina from 
pregnant Bayer process liquors by crystallisation. In the 
Bayer process, bauxite is digested with aqueous caustic to 
form a caustic liquor containing sodium aluminate and red 
mud, the red mud is separated by settling and filtration to 
produce the pregnant liquor, alumina trihydrate is 
crystallised from the pregnant liquor, and the supernatant 
liquor is recycled. It is known that the yield and properties of the 
crystals can be significantly affected by deliberate 
process conditions such as the temperature profile in the 
process and the amount and nature of crystal seed that is 
added to the process, and by impurities, especially organic 
salts such as sodium oxalate and sodium humate. Although it is naturally desirable to obtain a high 
yield of crystals, it is undesirable if the yield is 
provided mainly by very fine (below 45µm) crystals. 
However the presence of some fine crystals can be desirable 
for seeding purposes. Optimum performance requires optimisation of the yield 
and the average particle size, and the latter may be 
affected also by the strength of the crystals, i.e., the 
resistance to attrition. Merely increasing the yield 
while obtaining reduced crystal size is unsatisfactory, as 
is obtaining increased crystal size but reduced yield. It is well known to add a crystallisation modifier to 
the pregnant liquor in order to impose a deliberate 
modification on the crystallisation characteristics. The 
modification that is imposed usually involves a reduction 
in the proportion of fines, i.e., an increase in the 
average particle size. The use of mineral oil is 
described in DE-B-63607 and the use of surfactants in JP-A-54/158398 
and Chemical Abstracts 88:75961q. A review of 
many other known crystal modifiers appears in EP-A-286034. 
That specification teaches that the proportion of crystals  
 
below 44µm can be reduced if the crystal modifier is a 
combination of an oil-soluble surfactant and a mineral oil 
in which the surfactant is soluble. There is data in the 
specification showing that, compared to a process operated 
without a modifier, the use of the oil alone can give no 
improvement or only slight improvement. Because of the variability of Bayer process liquors 
and conditions there is a continuing need to develop other 
crystallisation modifier systems that will give an improved 
particle size distribution, for instance for use in those 
processes where known systems are not entirely 
satisfactory, and in
