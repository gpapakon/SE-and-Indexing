<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the preparation and use of
nucleic acid fragments encoding fatty acid desaturase
enzymes to modify plant lipid composition.Plant lipids have a variety of industrial and
nutritional uses and are central to plant membrane
function and climatic adaptation. These lipids
represent a vast array of chemical structures, and these
structures determine the physiological and industrial
properties of the lipid. Many of these structures
result either directly or indirectly from metabolic
processes that alter the degree of unsaturation of the
lipid. Different metabolic regimes in different plants
produce these altered lipids, and either domestication
of exotic plant species or modification of agronomically
adapted species is usually required to economically
produce large amounts of the desired lipid.Plant lipids find their major use as edible oils in
the form of triacylglycerols. The specific performance
and health attributes of edible oils are determined
largely by their fatty acid composition. Most vegetable
oils derived from commercial plant varieties are
composed primarily of palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0),
oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3)
acids. Palmitic and stearic acids are, respectively,
16- and 18-carbon-long, saturated fatty acids. Oleic,
linoleic, and linolenic acids are 16-carbon-long,
unsaturated fatty acids containing one, two, and three
double bonds, respectively. Oleic acid is referred to
as a mono-unsaturated fatty acid, while linoleic and
linolenic acids are referred to as poly-unsaturated
fatty acids. The relative amounts of saturated and 
unsaturated fatty acids in commonly used, edible
vegetable oils are summarized below (Table 1):

that saturated and unsaturated fatty acids play in
reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. In the
past, it was believed that mono-unsaturates, in contrast
to saturates and poly-unsaturates, had no effect on
serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease risk.
Several recent human clinical studies suggest that diets
high in mono-unsaturated fat and low in saturated fat
may reduce the "bad" (low-density lipoprotein)
cholesterol while maintaining the "good" (high-density
lipoprotein) cholesterol (Mattson et al., Journal of
Lipid Research (1985)
