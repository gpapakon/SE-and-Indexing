<DESCRIPTION>
 'DESCRIPTION SIZE COMPOSITIONTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to glass fibers and more particularly it relates to sizing compositions for glass fibers. Even more particularly, the invention relates to size compositions for continuous glass fibers useful for the reinforcement of plastics.BACKGROUND ARTAs is well known in the art, glass fibers which are intended for use as reinforcements usually require a size. This size is applied during the fiber forming process. That is, the glass fibers are sized with a protective material substantially immediately after they are formed. The sized glass fibers then are gathered into a bundle and the bundles are wound onto a forming package. The continuous glass fibers then are used in various processes such as pultrusion or filament winding.Sizing compositions need to provide a lubricating quality to the individual filaments to provide them with abrasion resistance.Additionally, the sizing composition must provide the fibers with an outer film which is compatible with the resin they will reinforce.In the manufacture of composite articles such as pipes, cases, reaction vessels, cones, tubes and bottles, conventional practice impregnates continuous filaments with a resin, forms the impregnated continuous filaments into a shaped article, and then cures the resin to form the composite. Common processes for making composites are filament winding and pultrusion.Filament winding is a process in which continuous filaments are impregnated with a resin, wound onto a mandrel to build the desired shape and thickness, and cured. By "mandrel" is meant a tool used in filament winding on which bands of fibers are deposited into 

 filamentary patterns to form layers. Upon curing of the resin, the composite so shaped is removed from the mandrel and applied to its intended use.The pultrusion process generally consists of pulling continuous filaments through a resin bath or impregnator and then into preforming fixtures (dies) in which a section of continuous filament impregnated with resin is partially shaped and excess resin and/or air are removed. Then the section is pulled through in heated dies in which it is cured.The industry continues to want the composites to have a longer working life, i.e., improved fatigue life such as cyclic fatigue in which the composites are subjected to repetitive loading cycles. These composites also need to sustain high working pressures, i.e., increased pressures at which the composite fail.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONWe now have
