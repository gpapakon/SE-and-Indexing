<DESCRIPTION>
Macrophages play a central role in host defense 
through a variety of effector mechanisms involving both membrane 
related and secretory events (Gordon et al., Curr. Opin.Immunol., 4, 25, 1992; Fuller, Brit. Med. J., 48, 65, 1992). 
Phagocytosis, chemotaxis and antigen presentation are membrane 
related processes involved in immunologic defense mechanisms 
necessary for host survival. The importance of macrophages in 
defense against microbes, immune surveillance, destruction of 
tumor cells, and in the clearing of senescent erythrocytes has 
been documented in man and in animal models characterized by the 
selective elimination of macrophages (Claassen et al., J.Immunol Meth, 134, 153, 1990). Macrophages also contribute to 
host defense through secretion of bacteriostatic and 
bactericidal proteins, cytokines and lipid mediators, as well as 
oxygen and nitrogen reactive intermediates. The secretory 
capacity of the macrophage is central to its function as these 
cells secrete over 100 distinct mediators and are located in 
every organ (Nathan, J.Clin. Invest., 79, 319, 1987). While aberrant activation of macrophage functions is 
associated with autoimmune diseases as well as both chronic and 
acute inflammatory processes, the reciprocal condition, 
suppression of macrophage effector functions, is associated with 
reoccurring infections of both opportunistic and non-opportunistic 
pathogens and contributes to increased morbidity 
and mortality. Populations associated with an immunocompromised 
state include burn patients, transplants, HIV infected 
individuals, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and 
surgical patients, notably those with a higher risk of infection 
as observed in thoracoabdominal patients. Current therapeutic approaches to these patients includes 
the use of intravenous infusion of macrophage derived cytokines 
notably the colony stimulating factors G-CSF, GM-CSF, and M-CSF 
(Nemunaitis, Transfusion 33: 70, 1993). Supportive therapy with 
antibiotics and fluids is also used however the limitations of 
these approaches are demonstrated by the continued problems of 
infection in immunocompromised patients and the emergence of  
 
more deadly strains of antibiotic resistant organisms. 
Furthermore, infections of immunocompromised patients with 
opportunistic pathogens including Pneumocystis and Cryptococcal 
infections remain significant and result in complications 
despite various antibiotic protocols. Clearly, novel 
therapeutics which can selectively enhance macrophage effector 
fun
