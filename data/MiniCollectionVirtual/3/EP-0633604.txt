<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a glass panel for silicon 
device fabrication, which method comprises forming a 

noncrystalline, or mixed-phase, silicon film (14) on a glass 
substrate (10), the glass having a strain point greater than 

560°C, and subjecting the filmed glass to a heat treatment 
comprising heating at a temperature of at least 550°C for a 

period of time sufficient to convert the silicon film (14) to 
polycrystalline silicon and to compact the glass (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to producing a glass panel for 
silicon devices, e.g., liquid crystal display (LCD) 
devices. Silicon is widely used in electronic devices, e.g. 
thin film transistors (TFTs), or liquid crystal display 
devices. It is a goal of the silicon device industry, and 
especially active matrix liquid crystal device (AMLCD) 
production, to achieve higher performance by replacing 
amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film transistors (TFTs) with 
a polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) version, which would 
result in higher on-currents, better frequency response, 
larger displays, and potentially longer life-times. It 
would be possible to implement peripheral circuitry, as 
well as pixel switches, on the glass substrate. This would 
greatly reduce the number of external connections to the 
substrate, thus increasing reliability and reducing cost. Poly-Si TFTs are very attractive for the above 
reasons. The poly-Si film required for TFT fabrication 
can be formed directly on a flat substrate with a high 
strain point of glasses such as proposed, for example, in 
Patents 5,116,787 and 5,116,789. Alternatively, a noncrystalline film, or a mixed-phase 
film, can be deposited and then heat treated to form a 
polycrystalline film, see M. K. Hatalis et al., "Low 
Temperature Polysilicon Thin Film Transistors on Corning 
Code 1734 and 1735 Glass Substrates", Proceedings of theSociety for Information Display, 1993, pp 724-7, the 
"mixed-phase" consisting of a mixture of noncrystalline and 
crystalline regions, becoming completely polycrystalline by 
a subsequent heat treatment, producing a film with a larger 
grain size for higher electron mobility and a smoother 
surface for subsequent gate dielectric deposition. Again, a glass exhibiting a high strain point is 
demanded. If, however, the glass is compacted via a 
combined non-damage anneal/crystallization process, then 
glasses demonstrating somewhat lower strain points, such as 
Corning Code 7059 glass with a nominal strain point of 
593°C, can be utilized. Heat treating at a higher 
temperature, i.e., one no lower than about 10°C below the 
glass strain point, e.g., 580°-590°C, would result in 
shorter process times for concurrent compaction and 
crystallization. A time temperature relationship is shown 
by N. A. Blum and C. Feldman, "The Crystallization of 
Amorphous Silicon Films", Journal of Non-Crystalline 
Solids, 11, pp. 242-6 (1972). Active LCDs require that the panels not only have 
precise dimensions which must be retained during subsequent 
proces
