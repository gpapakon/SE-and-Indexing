<ABSTRACT>
Pump synchronisation hub (2'), intended for fitting on to the drive shaft (4) of a fuel injection pump (6), with an annular support part (8), which serves as fixing part for the fixing of a gear wheel (10) driving the pump and in turn driven by the crankshaft of an engine. A curved recess is situated in the support part (8) of the hub (2') for the accommodation of an adjusting element (54), which can be fitted therein and which in the longitudinal direction of the recess can be fixed in different positions relative to the hub. A through-hole (58) for receiving a positioning pin (60), which serves for setting the hub (2') in a desired position relative to the housing (24) of the injection pump, is located in the adjusting element (54).

Synchronizing hub (2, 2') for a pump, for attachment to 
the input shaft (4) of a fuel injection pump (6), wherein 


said hub (2, 2') has an annular supporting part (8) for 
mounting a gear wheel (10) for driving said pump, 
said hub (2, 2') has said supporting part (8) being 
formed with a recess (12) to receive a setting member (14) in 

form of a setting plate (16) or a setting nut (54), 
said setting member (14) is capable of being locked in 
the longitudinal direction of said recess (12) in different 

positions relative to said hub (2, 2'), and 
said setting member (14) has a through hole (18; 58) to 
receive a positioning member, for example a positioning pin 

(22; 60) for setting said hub (2, 2') in a desired position 
relative to the housing of the injection pump (24), 
 
characterized in that 


said recess (12) is arcuate and is arranged at a radial 
distance from and on the inside of the outer edge (26) of 

said annular supporting part (8), and in that 
said setting member (14) is locked in a radial direction 
by its engagement with a border wall of said recess (12). 
Synchronizing hub for a pump according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said recess (12) in the supporting part 

(8) has a passageway (28; 44), in that a portion (32) of said 
setting member (14) is receivable within said passageway (28; 

44), and in that the positioning member is guided axially 
within the through hole (18; 58) of the setting member (14) 

at least along said portion.  
 
Synchronizing hub for a pump according to claim 2, 
characterized in that said arcuate recess (12) comprises said 

passageway (28) and a groove (30) adjacent thereto formed in 
that side (52) of the supporting part (8) which faces away 

from the pump housing, and in that the setting member (14) 
consists of a setting plate (16) which comprises a sleeve-shaped 

portion (32) receivable within said passageway (28) 
and an arcuate, disc-shaped supporting part (34) extending 

beyond that portion, which can be received within said groove 
(30). 
Synchronizing hub for a pump according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the sleeve-shaped portion (32) of said 

setting plate has an axial through hole (18) which serves as 
a location hole for the positioning member which is preferably 

designed as a pin (22), and in that for locking said setting 
plate (16) in a desired adjusted position within said 

arcuate recess (12), said disc-shaped supporting part (34) of 
said setting plate (16) is formed with an arcuate passageway 

(36) for receiving the shank of a screw (42) capable of being 
screwed into the bottom (38) of said groove (30). 
Synchronizing hub for a pump according to claim 2, 
characterized in that said passageway (44) is provided with a 

step in diameter, and in that said setting member is an arcuate 
setting nut (54) which can be received in a radially 

larger portion (46) of said step comprising passageway (44), 
this portion being arranged on that side (48) of the supporting 

part (8) which faces the pump housing (24). 
Synchronizing hub for a pump according to claim 5, 
characterized in that a locking screw (56) having a central 

axial through hole (58), screwed into said arcuate setting 
nut (54), is received in said step comprising passageway 

(44), said hole serving to receive the positioning member,  
 

preferably designed as a pin (60), and the threaded shank 
(62) of the screw (56), capable of being screwed into said 

setting nut (54), extending freely through a radially narrower 
segment (50) of said step comprising passageway (44). 
Synchronizing hub for a pump according to claim 6, 
characterized in that a hexagon socket screw serves as the 

locking screw (56), the head (64) of which can be tightened 
against that side (52) of the annular supporting part of the 

hub (2') which faces away from the pump housing. 
Synchronizing hub for a pump according to any of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the annular supporting part (8) of the 

hub (2, 2') has several, for example five threaded holes (66) 
to receive a corresponding number of fastening screws (68) by 

means of which said pump driving gear wheel (10) which is 
driven by a motor shaft can be threadingly attached to the 

supporting part (8) of the hub (2, 2') on that side (52) of 
said supporting part which faces away from the pump housing 

(24). 
Synchronizing hub for a pump according to any of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that within the pump housing (24) or within 

a part integral with it, an insertion hole (70) is provided 
for receiving of the one end of said positioning member, 

preferably designed as a pin (22, 60), so that it can be 
inserted through the through hole (18, 58) formed in said 

setting member (16, 54).
