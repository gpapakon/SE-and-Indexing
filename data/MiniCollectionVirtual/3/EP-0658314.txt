<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a procedure for producing 
fodder raw material containing keratinous material, 

the moisture content of the wet cleaned material 
being reduced and the material being cut up; the 

cut-up material being treated chemically and/or enzymatically, 
whereafter the material product thus obtained 

is brought into the form in which it will be 
used in fodder. As taught by
 the invention, the cleaned, 
wet keratinous material is dewatered by pressing. 

Furthermore, the invention concerns fodder raw material 
containing treated keratinous material. The invention 

moreover concerns apparatus for treating keratinous 
material going to be made into fodder raw material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a procedure
for producing fodder raw material containing keratinous
material and fodder raw material containing keratinous
material, and apparatus for processing keratinous
material which is being made into fodder raw material,
as stated in claims 1, 11 and 12.Keratinous material is in this context understood
to be generally whatever material containing
keratin, in particular material having capillary
structures, such as feathers, animal hair, wool, etc.,
or a mixture of these.Feathers, which are rich in keratin protein,
have been used in fodder industry for raw material in
making animal fodders. Owing to poor utilizability, it
has usually been necessary to treat the feathers chemically
or enzymatically in order to convert the material
into a form which is more easily digestible in
the animal's digestive tract. Chemical treatment is
implemented e.g. by means of acid hydrolysis, using
mineral acids. In enzymatic treatment e.g. pepsin is
used for enzyme.Commonly, in the procedure for producing
feather fodder raw material the feathers are wet-cleaned,
e.g. sterilized, and the cleaned, wet feathers
are usually cut up/comminuted in order to enhance
the acid or enzyme treatment taking place in the next
step. The treated product is thereafter brought into
the form in which it will be used in the fodder.Owing to the structure of feathers, the
cleaned, wet feathers cannot be cut up/comminuted as
they are: reduction of the material's moisture content
is first required. However, reduction of moisture content
is problematic because water is firmly bound in 
the capillaries of the feathers. When using
existing methods and cutting/comminuting apparatus,
drying the feathers, i.e. removal of extra water by
evaporation, has been the sole usable way to achieve
appropriate moisture content. A drying step like this
requires a special drying apparatus, and it adds to
the number of steps in the treatment process.US 4,151,306 discloses a screw press for
dewatering feathers wherein the moisture flows through
slots in the compression barrell in order to reduce
the cost of thermally drying. - However, this
apparatus does not solve the problems mentioned above,
ie. with this apparatus the feather material is
pressed to dry matter content about 30 - 40 % (claim
2) only, which does not fulfill the requirements,
specially when thinking the following steps in the
procedure.JP 62006639 discloses the production of
feather meal in an apparatus which has a compression
dehydration zone with a number of

material being treated chemically and/or

enzymatically, whereafter the material product thus
obtained is brought into the form in which it will be

used in fodder, wherein the keratinous material is
pressed with a screw press which is encircled by a

perforated shell, whereby the water contained in the
material escapes through the holes in the shell,
