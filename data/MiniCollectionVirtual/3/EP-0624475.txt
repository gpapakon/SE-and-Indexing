<ABSTRACT>
A length (c) of a melamine foamed block (12) to 
be accommodated in an ink tank housing (11) as 

measured in the longitudinal direction is 
dimensioned to be larger than a length (C) of the 

ink tank housing (11) as measured in the 
longitudinal direction. Thus, while the foamed 

block (12) is accommodated in the ink tank housing 
(11), it is compressed in the direction orienting 

toward an ink feeding port (13) from which ink is 
fed to a printing head (14), i.e., in the ink 

feeding direction. Consequently, the ink retaining 
force induced by the capillary force is not 

intensified in the compressing direction of the 
melamine foamed block (12), resulting in an ink 

feeding capability of the printing head (14) being 
improved. On the contrary, the ink retaining force 

effective at a right angle relative to the 
compressing direction of the melamine foamed block 

(12) is intensified.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink tank for storably
receiving ink therein according to the preamble of claim 1.
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a head cartridge
according to claim 26 and an ink jet printing apparatus according
to claim 28 each of which comprises an ink tank according to the
preamble of claim 1.Here, the printing operation represents all type
of operations each to be performed for a various
kind of ink receiving medium such as a cloth, a
thread, a paper, a sheet-like material or the like
so as to allow ink to be adhesively secured thereto.
Therefore, the present invention can be applied to a
printing apparatus, i.e., a printer serving as an
information outputting apparatus operatively
associated with a various kind of information
processing apparatus.Many foamed blocks each molded of a polyurethane
resin are hitherto used as an ink absorbing member
to be accommodated in an ink tank of the foregoing
type In the case that a urethane foamed block is 
used as an ink absorbing member, films are formed in
the foamed block during each molding operation in
such a manner as to wrap each of a number of voids
(pores) in the foamed block with a film. Thus,
since the voids are isolated from each other due to
the presence of the film between adjacent voids, the
foamed block can not exhibit a function of
absorbing ink therein as it is. To cope with this
problem, the foamed block is subjected to film
removing treatment via heating, cleaning and others.
However, it is very difficult to completely remove
films in the foamed block with the film removing
treatment as mentioned above. In most cases, a
considerable amount of residue practically adheres
to each void or pore on completion of the film
removing treatment.In the case that the urethane foamed block is
used as the ink absorbing member, it is usually
accommodated in the ink tank in the compressed
state. In addition, to assure that an adequate
intensity of negative pressure acts on a
communicating portion between the foamed block and a
connecting member for an ink outflow portion while
maintaining a certain pressure gradient across the
foregoing communicating portion, a part of the
foamed block is usually compressed at the
communicating portion. However, since film residues
remaining between adjacent voids or pores are liable
to overlap in the foamed block, there arise
malfunctions that ink hardly flows in the ink
absorbing member, and moreover, ink fails to be fed
outside of the ink tank.On the other hand, in contrast with the
