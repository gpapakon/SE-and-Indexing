<ABSTRACT>
The Microkeratotome includes a body (1) inside which
a chassis (8) is housed where two motors (10) and (12)

are installed which provide the oscillation of the
corresponding cutting blade and the movement of the head

(21) in which the cutting blade itself (20) is situated,
all of which is combined with a suction ring (24) which

immobilizes and imparts vacuum pressure to the eyeball
through an orifice, the vacuum pressure being distributed

simultaneously from the ring (24) through a peripheral
channel situated in the same. The said ring is prevented

from coming loose due to the maximum pressure reached in
the eye when the unit is mounted upon it. It also

includes an electronic control unit which has, according
to the keratometry appropriate to the patient, several

programmes which predefine cutting qualities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a microkeratotome for the
dissection of lamellae of corneal tissue, which has been
conceived with characteristics that make it feasible to
submerge it in sterilizing fluids for a practical and
fast sterilization of the parts other than those of the
mechanical transmission system which this type of
apparatus includes, in order to reduce the time or
interval between cornea-sectioning operations in which it
is used, above all in cases where both eyes of the same
patient are being operated on. The microkeratotome has
means that make complete transparency possible in the
cutting area, incorporating likewise an electronic unit
with several cutting programmes to be selected according
to the keratometry.It is equally an object of the invention to provide a
microkeratotome which gives optimal visibility to the
surgeon during an operation, by virtue of the fact that
the side pieces of the head have been made with a small
height, and also the incorporation of a transparent plate
in correspondence with the cutting area. Also, greater
control during an operation is achieved by the
microkeratotome of the invention due to the fact that the
corresponding suction ring which immobilizes the eyeball
has a specific size and design, being provided with a
peripheral channel which uniformly and firmly distributes
the vacuum pressure by means of which the eyeball is
immobilized.In 1949 Dr. Jos√© Barraquer, in Columbia, suggested
that sight problems could be corrected by a surgical
operation to change the curvature of the cornea. In its
origins the procedure consisted of cutting a thin section
from the frontal part of the cornea and subsequently
freezing it to give the desired shape using a cryogenic
lathe and then thawing it before implanting it.The instrument used to make sections in the cornea
is known as a Microkeratotome and the system upon which
its action is based today is that of cutting a lamella of
the desired thickness without complete detachment from
the rest and forming a hinge which, when folded back,
leaves an area of operation free for the laser, with
which the curvature of the cornea will be modified by its
action, and is subsequently refolded for cicatrization to
take place.In the last thirty years Microkeratotomes have been
used with the aim of obtaining corneal lamellae of the
desired size and thickness. An apparatus which
immobilizes the eye has always been used, and another one
which, in the manner of a "carpenter's plane", moves and
cuts the lamella.In the first models, the cutting

<CLAIMS>
A Microkeratotome for the dissection of
lamellae of corneal tissue, which is intended to carry

out sections in the cornea by cutting a lamella of a
desired thickness without completely severing it from the

rest, and subsequently modifying with a laser the
curvature of the cornea itself, and including a pair of

motors (10, 12) to impart oscillatory movement to a
corresponding cutting blade (20) situated in a head (21), and

linear movement to a sliding anchoring part (23) which is
connected to a suction ring (24) by means of which the eyeball

is immobilized, and which
includes a general body (1) in which the mechanical

transmissions are situated including the
oscillation (10) and linear (12) motors, 
characterized in that
 said body (1)
comprises a detachable side cover (2), the

removal of which makes it possible to extract the
mechanical transmissions including the motors with

their associated components, so as to allow sterilization
of the rest by immersion in a specific liquid or fluid.
A Microkeratotome for the dissection of
lamellae of corneal tissue, as claimed in claim 1,


characterized in that
 inside the body (1) an extractible
chassis (8) is mounted with positioning and installation

means (9, 11) for the motors (10, 12) which
form part of the mechanical transmission, a chassis which

together with the said motors and other components may be
extracted after removal of the cover (2), and a

corresponding sterilization carried out, by immersion in
the specific fluid, of all the parts exposed to direct

contact with the surgeon and the patient.
A Microkeratotome for the dissection of
lamellae of corneal tissue, as claimed in claim 1, 


characterized in that
 the head (21) to which oscillatory
movement is transmitted by the motor (10), incorporates

in its frontal part a transparent plate (36) which
flattens the cornea and delimits the cutting thickness

according to the separation of its rear edge from the
edge of the blade (20) situated in the head itself (21),

allowing the surgeon to visually track the operation, by
virtue of its shape.
A Microkeratotome for the dissection of
lamellae of corneal tissue, as claimed in claim 1,


characterized in that
 the suction ring (24) has a
peripheral channel (39) by means of which vacuum pressure

is distributed to the eyeball uniformly and around the
perimeter, having provided that the ocular pressure,

which rises when positioning is carried out upon the
patients eye, prevents the said suction ring from coming

loose.
A Microkeratotome for the dissection of
lamellae of corneal tissue, as claimed in claim 1,


characterized in that
 it includes an electronic control
unit with several predefined programmes, in accordance

with the needs of each surgeon, to be selected according
to the patients keratometry, which combine a determinate

blade (20) oscillation speed and a movement speed in the
cutting unit and its path and stopping point.
A Microkeratotome for the dissection of
lamellae of corneal tissue, as claimed in claim 1,


characterized in that
 it has a Reset system which
restores the electrical system to normal conditions in

the event that any malfunction in the vacuum is detected,
activating an alarm system which immobilizes both the

cutting movement and its path, with visual and acoustic
indications, disabling the action of the motors; there is 

also the possibility that once the vacuum has been
restored, and according to the surgeon's judgement, the

operation may continue or be halted after the cutting
unit has been returned.
A Microkeratotome for the dissection of
lamellae of corneal tissue, as claimed in claim 1,


characterized in that
 it has an electromechanical sensor
which resets an impulse counter which controls the linear

movement of the head when the latter is in its initial
position, allowing control of the closed loop.
