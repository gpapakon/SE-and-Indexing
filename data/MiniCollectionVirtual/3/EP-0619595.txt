<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electron source and an 
image forming device, such as a display device, that is 
an application thereof. More particularly, the 
invention relates to an image forming device and an 
image forming method in which a plurality of cold 
cathode electron sources are arrayed two-dimensionally 
in a plane to present a color display.  
 EP-A-0 523 702 describes an image-forming device having an 
electron-emitting element and image-forming members for 
forming the electron-emitting element. Moreover, a modulating means modulating the electron beam 
emitted from the electron-emitting element in accordance with 
an information signal is mentioned.  
 Two types of electron sources, namely thermionic 
cathode and cold cathode electron sources, are known as 
electron emission devices. Examples of cold cathode 
electron sources are electron emission devices of the 
field emission type (abbreviated to "FE" below), 
metal/insulator/metal type (abbreviated to "MIM" below) 
and surface-conduction emission type (abbreviated to 
"SCE". Known examples of the FE type are described by W.P. 
Dyke and W.W. Dolan, "Field emission", Advance in 
Electron Physics, 8.89 (1956) and by C.A. Spindt, 
"Physical properties of thin-film field emission 
cathodes with molybdenum cones", J. Appl. Phys., 47.5248  
 
(1976). A known example of the MIM type is described by 
C.A. Mead, "The tunnel-emission amplifier", J. Appl. 
Phys., 32.616 (1961). A known example of the SCE type is described by 
M.I. Elinson, Radio. Eng. Electron Phys., 10 (1965). The SCE type makes use of a phenomenon in which an 
electron emission is produced in a small-area thin film, 
which has been formed on a substrate, by passing a 
current parallel to the film surface. Various examples of this surface-conduction 
electron emitting devices have been reported. One 
relies upon a thin film of SnO2 according to Elinson, 
mentioned above. Other examples use thin film of Au 
[G. Dittmer: "Thin Solid Films", p.317, (1972)]; a thin 
film of In2O3/SnO2 [M. Harwell and C. G. Fonstad: "IEEE 
Trans. E.D. Conf.", 519 (1975)]; and a thin film of 
carbon [Hisashi Araki, et al: "Vacuum", Vol. 26, No. 1, 
p. 22 (1983)]. Fig. 33 illustrates the construction of the device 
adcording to M. Hartwell, described above. This device 
is typical of the surface-conduction electron emitting 
devices. As shown in Fig. 33, numeral 2501 denotes an 
insulative substrate. Numeral 2502 denotes a H-shaped 
thin film for forming an electron-emitting region. The
