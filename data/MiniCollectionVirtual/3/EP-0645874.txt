<ABSTRACT>
In the rotor of an electrical machine, especially a turbogenerator, the rotor winding is connected to the sliprings and/or to the rotating exciter device via field current conductors (4, 5) which are arranged in pairs in a central shaft hole (3) in the rotor (1). In this case, the slipring arrangement or the exciter device is arranged on a shaft stub which is connected to the rotor shaft (1) by means of a detachable coupling (17). In the case of hydrogen-cooled machines, it is highly problematic to seal the exciter cable in the coupling region. It is therefore proposed to provide connecting pieces (31, 32) on the bolt side in the central shaft hole (3), into which connecting pieces radially running current supply bolts (7, 8) are detachably fastened. The field current conductors are designed as metallic tubes (4, 5) of circular cross-section. These tubes (4, 5) are firmly connected at the other end to solid connecting pieces (36, 37) on the coupling side. The ends (36a, 37a) of these connecting pieces pass through a sealing plate (43) in the coupling and are electrically insulated therefrom. Sealing rings are used to seal the sealing plate (43) from the rotor shaft (1) and from those ends (36a, 37a) of the connecting pieces (36, 37) on the coupling side which pass through the sealing plate (43). Advantageously, only circular or planar sealing surfaces are provided.

Exciter current line in the central shaft bore 
(3) in the rotor of an electric machine, in particular 

turbo generator, for connecting the exciter current 
conductors (4, 5) which are arranged centrally in pairs 

extending axially in the rotor and provided with a 
cooling channel in the longitudinal direction of the 

conductors to, on the one hand, current supply bolts 
(7, 8), arranged radially in the rotor shaft (1), for the 

rotor winding (6) and, on the other hand, an exciter 
current source (13, 14) which is arranged on a shaft stub 

(15) which is attached to the non-drive-side shaft end of 
the rotor (2) by means of a releasable coupling (16), 

characterized in that the coupling-side ends of the

to coupling-side connection elements (36, 37; 36', 
37), in that the said connection elements have an essentially 

circular cross-section and with their ends penetrate 
axially extending through-bores in a sealing 

plate (43) and are electrically insulated therefrom, the 
sealing plate (43) being screwed in the region of the 

coupling (16) to the shaft end, and in that means (50-59)

respect to the rotor shaft (1) and with respect to the

releasably attached, in that the exciter current conductors 
are realized as metallic pipes (25, 26) with an 

orbicular cross-section and are permanently connected to 
the bolt-side connection elements (31, 32), in that these 

pipes are permanently connected at the other end to the

Exciter current line according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the coupling-side ends of the 

metallic pipes (25, 26) and the connection elements

which, apart from two lateral flattened portions, completely 
fills the shaft bore (3).

end, a semicircular cross-section, and in that the

screwed directly into the exciter current conductors. 
Exciter current line according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the exciter current conductors have 

at the coupling-side end (4', 5') a junction element
