<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drive in an electromechanical information apparatus for playing magnetic-tape cassettes (7), having a loading mechanism,   - which can handle cassettes both of an analog playing standard and of a digital playing standard (7), provided with a slide (7b), - which has a cassette compartment (1), into which the magnetic-tape cassette (7) can be brought manually into a position at which the cassette is automatically drawn in by the loading mechanism, and in which a cassette holder (5) is guided displaceably in the displacing direction of the magnetic-tape cassette (6, 7), - which has an ejecting lever (8), which can be swivelled to the side of the cassette compartment (1) about a spindle (8a), running perpendicularly with respect to the displacing direction, and acts on the cassette holder (5) in such a way that it can draw in the cassette holder (5) from the draw-in position and can move it out into the said draw-in position, and   - which has a lever arrangement (9, 10) with an opening pin (11e), a lever arrangement (9, 10) controlling the movement of an opening pin (11e) for the slide (7b) in such a way that, if the cassette (7) of the digital standard is pushed in between the draw-in position, in which the slide is still closed, and from there to the position at which the automatic drawing-in begins, the opening pin (11e) opens the slide (7b) in a movement counter to the pushing-in movement of the cassette (7).
