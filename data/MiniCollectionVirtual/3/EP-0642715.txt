<ABSTRACT>
In a radio receiver with digital signal processing, a received stereo multiplex signal and digitalized useful signals derived therefrom are processed at a first scanning rate. Auxiliary signals at least partially derived from the stereo multiplex signal are processed at a second scanning rate lower than the first scanning rate. The scanning rate of the processed auxiliary signals is increased up to the first scanning speed, and the processed auxiliary signals act as control signals at the first scanning rate on the stereo multiplex signal and useful signals.

Method for digitally processing received
broadcast radio signals, where a received stereo

multiplex signal and useful signals derived therefrom
are processed in digital form at a first sampling rate,

where auxiliary signals (H1, H2, H3) derived, at least
to some extent, from the stereo multiplex signal are

converted to a second sampling rate, which is lower
than the first sampling rate, and are processed at the

second sampling rate, where the sampling rate of the
processed auxiliary signals is increased to the first

sampling rate, and where the processed auxiliary
signals, as control signals (D, AFE-AMU) at the first

sampling rate, influence the stereo multiplex signal
and the useful signals (L, R).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 increasing the sampling rate (22, 23) of the
processed auxiliary signals to the first sampling rate

is followed directly by low-pass filtering (22', 23').
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 a first auxiliary signal (H1) is
derived which contains spectral components of the

stereo multiplex signal between the upper limit of the
useful frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal

and the first sampling rate, and whose sampling rate is
reduced to the second sampling rate.
Method according to one of Claims 2 or 3,

characterized in that
, during the stereo coding, a
symmetry signal is produced which is in quadrature with 

respect to the difference band (L-R) and forms the
second auxiliary signal (H2) using a low-pass filter

(16) and a reduction (17) of the sampling rate to the
second sampling rate.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 a third auxiliary signal
(H3) is produced from an amplitude-demodulated FM

intermediate frequency signal (18) by means of low-pass
filtering (19) and reduction (20) of the sampling rate.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 combining the auxiliary
signals (H1, H2, H3) produces a first control signal

(D), which influences the stereo channel separation,
and a second control signal (AFE-AMU), which reduces

the volume of the reproduced useful signals (L, R) in
the event of interference.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the first and the second
sampling rate have an integer ratio with respect to one

another.
Method according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
that
 the first sampling rate is 228 kHz and the second
sampling rate is 9.5 kHz.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the stereo multiplex
signal (MPX 1) can be supplied in digital form by a

reception device (2) at a third sampling rate, which is
above the first sampling rate and is preferably twice

the first sampling rate.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the stereo multiplex
signal, the useful signals, the auxiliary signals (H1,

H2, H3) and the control signals (D, AFE-AMU) are
processed in a digital signal processor using a program

which comprises program parts for processing the stereo
multiplex signal and the useful signals, and n program

parts for processing the auxiliary and control signals,
where n is the ratio of the first to the second

sampling rate, and 
in that
 the program per se is 
repeatedly executed at a frequency corresponding to the

first sampling rate, the program parts for processing
the stereo multiplex signal and the useful signals and,

in each case, one other of the program parts for
processing the auxiliary and control signals being

executed with each pass.
Broadcast radio receiver with digital signal
processing, having a tuner (2) for receiving a stereo

multiplex signal, having first means (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
for processing the received stereo multiplex signal and

useful signals derived therefrom in digital form at a
first sampling rate, having means for reducing the

sampling rate (14, 15, 17, 20) for auxiliary signals
derived, at least to some extent, from the stereo

multiplex signal to a second sampling rate, which is
lower than the first sampling rate, having further

means for processing the auxiliary signals (H1, H2, H3)
at the second sampling rate, having means for

increasing the sampling rate (22, 23) for the processed
auxiliary signals to the first sampling rate, and

having means (8, 9, 10) for influencing the stereo
multiplex signal and the useful signals derived

therefrom using the control signals, formed from the
auxiliary signals, at the first sampling rate.
