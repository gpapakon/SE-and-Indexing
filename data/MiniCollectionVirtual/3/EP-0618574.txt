<ABSTRACT>
A clock reproducing apparatus is adapted for reproducing a data existing point clock 
signal by using a reproduction signal obtained from a magnetic disc (1) on which clock 

patterns for clock reproduction are recorded in servo ares discretely provided 
independent of data recording area, which comprises: a voltage controlled oscillator 

(17) operative to oscillate the data existing point clock signal; a sampling circuit (11) 
for sampling the reproduction signal in synchronism with the data existing point clock 

signal; a phase information generator (14) for weighting-adding plural sample values 
before and after a reference sample value corresponding to the peak of a reproduced 

isolated waveform of the clock pattern to thereby generate phase information indicating 
a phase difference between the data existing point clock signal and a reproduction signal 

of the clock pattern; and a control voltage converter (15,16) for converting phase 
information generated by the phase information generator to a control voltage for 

controlling the voltage controlled oscillator (17). Moreover, the clock reproducing 
apparatus further comprises a phase synchronization loop control circuit (18) adapted to 

generate a phase comparison timing signal for allowing a sample value after a 
predetermined data existing point clock time from occurrence time of a signal which 

detects a unique pattern for recognizing an approximate existing time of the clock 
pattern. In addition, when there is employed a configuration to detect data in 

synchronism with the data existing point clock signal, a data recording apparatus is 
provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clock reproducing apparatus and
a data reproducing apparatus in a magnetic disc system such as
a hard disc drive, etc.An external clock type magnetic disc system is adapted to
generate a clock signal synchronous with a data existing point
which gives recording/reproduction timing of data on the basis
of clock patterns discretely arranged at equal intervals on
concentrical or helical recording tracks. Namely, by a phase
synchronization loop (so called PLL) adapted to control an
oscillating phase of a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) by
phase error information obtained by detecting a peak existing
time of a reproduced signal waveform of the above clock pattern
by using a peak detector to sample and hold a saw-tooth wave at
that time to carry out phase comparison thereof, a clock signal
synchronous with the data existing point is reproduced.In the conventional clock reproducing apparatus, since phase
comparison is carried out on the basis of the clock pattern, a
peak detector and a saw-tooth wave generator were used. These
circuit elements are a complicated analog signal processing
circuit, so it was difficult to allow the circuit to become 
compact and/or to be adjustment-free. As a matter of course, it
was also difficult that such clock reproducing circuit block
coexist with other circuit blocks within one LSI adapted so that
digital processing is implemented. EP-A-0 438 784 discloses a clock reproducing apparatus for synchronizing an external
clock signal with a reproduction signal obtained by a magnetic head from a magnetic
disc on which clock patterns for reproduction of clock are recorded in servo areas
discretely provided independent of data recording areas, with sampling means for
sampling the reproduction signal in synchronism with an external clock signal and with
phase information generating means for adding a plurality of sample values of a
reproduced isolated waveform of the clock pattern from said sampling means to thereby
generate phase information indicating a phase difference between the external clock
signal and the reproduction signal of the clock pattern. With the above-mentioned drawbacks in view, an object of
this invention is to provide a clock reproducing apparatus and
a data reproducing apparatus which permit the circuit to become
compact and adjustment-free, and to be digitally implemented with
ease.This object is achieved by a clock reproducing apparatus and a data reproducing apparatus according to claim 1 and claim 8, respectively.In accordance
