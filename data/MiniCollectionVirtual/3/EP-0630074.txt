<ABSTRACT>
A structure of a vehicle charging connector includes a 
depressed connector receptacle (11) formed in a body of a 

vehicle, a receptacle lid (25) mounted on the receptacle 
(11) to close and open an opening of the receptacle (11), a 

secondary connector (12) mounted on a rear wall of the 
receptacle (11) and having an opening open to the opening of 

the receptacle (11), the secondary connector (12) including 
a connector lid (18) closing and opening the opening 

thereof, and a butting member (22) mounted between an inner 
face of the receptacle lid (25) and an outer face of the 

connector lid (18), the butting member (22) butting against 
at least one of the receptacle lid (25) and the connector 

lid (18) when the receptacle lid (25) is closed. When the 
receptacle lid (25) is closed in the condition that the 

connector lid (18) is incompletely closed, the inside face 
of the receptacle lid (25) abuts against the butting member 

(22) mounted on the connector lid (18). When the receptacle 
lid (25) is closed in this state, the connector lid (18) is 

pushed via the pushing member (22) to close the connector 
housing (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a structure of a vehicle
charging connector applied to vehicles such as electric
vehicles, a vehicle charging connector and a receptacle
enclosing the vehicle charging connector.FIG. 6 shows a conventional structure of a vehicle
charging connector. A connector receptacle 1 having an
opening is provided in one side of a body of a vehicle to be
depressed inward of the body. A cylindrical connector
housing 2 enclosing terminals (not shown) therein is mounted
on a rear wall of the receptacle 1 so that an opening
thereof is directed toward the opening of the receptacle 1.
A connecting piece 3 protrudes from the side face of the
connector housing 2 obliquely upwardly, as viewed in FIG. 6.
A waterproof connector lid 4 closing the opening of the
connector housing 2 is rotatably mounted on the connecting
piece 3. The connector lid 4 has a waterproofing packing on
its inside outer periphery. A coil spring (not shown) is
interposed between the connector lid 4 and the connecting
piece 3 to urge the connector lid 4 in the direction in
which the connector lid 4 is closed. The receptacle 1 has a
receptacle lid 5 closing the opening thereof. A locking
member 6 is provided between the receptacle lid 5 and the
vehicle body for holding the receptacle lid 5 in its closed
state.In charging a power battery of the vehicle, the locking 
member 6 is released and then, the receptacle lid 5 is opened. The connector lid 4 is
opened against the urging force of the coil spring. Thereafter, a charger side connector is
fitted into a vehicle side connector and then, charging is initiated. Upon completion of
charging, the charger side connector is disengaged from the vehicle side connector and
then, the connector lid 4 is closed. The connector lid 4 is urged by the coil spring and
closes the opening of the connector housing 2. The connector lid 4 is held in its closed
state. The receptacle lid 5 is closed and engaged with the locking member 6 such that it
is held in its closed state.In the above-described structure, the sealing performance of the connector lid 4
is improved as the urging force of the coil spring becomes large. However. a large force
is required of an operator to open and close the connector lid 4. Accordingly, operation
of the connector lid 4 becomes troublesome and there is a possibility that the operator
may have his or her finger caught between the connector housing 2 and the connector
lid 4. In view of this drawback, the coil spring is conventionally set to a relatively small
urging force.

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle charging connector comprising a depressed connector receptacle (11)
formed in a body of a vehicle, a receptacle lid (25) mounted on the receptacle

(11) to close and open an opening of the receptacle (11), and a connector
housing (12) mounted on a rear wall of the receptacle (11) and having an

opening open to the opening of the receptacle (11), the connector housing (12)
including a connector lid (18) closing and opening the opening thereof,

characterized by

a butting member (22) provided between an inner face of the hingedly mounted
receptacle lid (25) and an outer face of the hingedly mounted connector lid (18),

the butting member (22) butting against one of the receptacle lid (25) and the
connector lid (18) when the receptacle lid (25) is closed for pushing said connector

lid (18) to completely close said opening of said connector housing (12) and
to hold said connector lid (18) in its closed position by said butting member (22)

while holding said receptacle lid (25) in its closed position.
The connector according to claim 1, characterized in that said butting member
(22) is mounted on the outer face of the connector lid (18).
The connector according to claim 1, characterized in that said butting member
(22) is mounted on the inner face of the receptacle lid (25).
The connector according to claim 1, characterized in that said butting member
(22) is mounted on the receptacle (25) of the vehicle body.
The connector according to anyone of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said
butting member (22) includes an elastic expanding and contracting member (23)

in face of a counterpart member against which the butting member butts.
