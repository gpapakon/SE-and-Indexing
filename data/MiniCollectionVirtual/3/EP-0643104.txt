<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic moulding compositions containing, as essential components,   A) from 45 to 85% by weight of a thermoplastic polyester made from terephthalic acid or predominantly terephthalic acid and a diol, B) from 5 to 30% by weight of a graft copolymer having a mean particle diameter of from 50 to 200 nm, built up from     b1) from 50 to 90% by weight of a graft core comprising     b1.1) from 75 to 99.9% by weight of a (C2- to C10-alkyl)acrylate b1.2) from 0.1 to 5% by weight of a monomer containing at least two olefinically unconjugated double bonds and   b1.3) up to 24.9% by weight of further copolymerisable monomers  and   b2) from 10 to 50% by weight of a graft shell comprising   b2.1) from 50 to 90% by weight of styrene or a polymerisable styrene derivative and b2.2) from 10 to 50% by weight of acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile,       C) from 5 to 30% by weight of a graft copolymer having a mean particle diameter of from 250 to 1000 nm, built up from     c1) from 50 to 90% by weight of a graft core comprising     c1.1) from 75 to 99.9% by weight of a (C2-C10-alkyl) acrylate, c1.2) from 0.1 to 5% by weight of a monomer containing at least two olefinically unconjugated double bonds and   c1.3) up to 24.9% by weight of further copolymerisable monomers,  and   c2) from 10 to 50% by weight of a graft shell comprising   c2.1) from 50 to 90% by weight of styrene or a polymerisable styrene derivative and c2.2) from 10 to 50% by weight of acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile,      and   D) from 5 to 25% by weight of a copolymer comprising   d1) from 50 to 90% by weight of styrene or a polymerisable styrene derivative and d2) from 10 to 50% by weight of acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile.
