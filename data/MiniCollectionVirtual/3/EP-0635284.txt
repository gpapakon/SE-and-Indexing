<ABSTRACT>
A play device, especially a rope network pyramid, has a substantially vertical mast and a plurality of guy ropes, the mast, by means of the ropes extending from its top to the ground on which it is erected and having mutual transverse connections, being held in its position by a method whereby the free ends of the ropes are each connected to a tensioning anchor located in the ground, at least one adjustable elastic element (5, 5.1, 5.2) being provided in at least one of the ropes (3, 3') serving to guy the mast or one fixing point for a plurality of ropes, the extensibility of the elastic element (5, 5.1, 5.2) being designed to be such that, after the appropriate setting of an increased prestress at a first point in time, especially when the play device is erected, it absorbs the initial axial extension of the respective guy rope by a corresponding axial shortening, and the elastic element, even after the initial extension is essentially completed, is under a prestress which corresponds to a target prestress which is to be maintained.
