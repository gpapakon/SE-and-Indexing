<ABSTRACT>

portion (2) with axial edges (E1,E2), said tread 

portion (2) being curved so that the maximum cross 
sectional width of the tyre lies between the tread 

edges (E1,E2), a pair of axially spaced bead 
portions (4), a pair of sidewall portions (3) 

extending between the tread edges and the bead 
portions (4), a pair of bead cores (5) one disposed 

in each bead portion (4), a carcass (6) having a 
main portion (6a) extending between the bead 

portions (4) and a pair of turned up portions (6b) 
each turned up around each said bead core (5), a 

belt (7) disposed radially outside the carcass (6) 
and inside the tread portion (2), said belt (7) 

being formed by spirally winding a ribbon-shaped 
strip (10) of rubber in which a single cord or a 

plurality of parallel cords are embedded along the 
longitudinal direction thereof, at a small angle to 

the tyre equator (C), characterised by a pair of 
axially spaced reinforcing cord layers (9) disposed 

radially inside of the belt (7) and outside of the 
carcass (6), each reinforcing cord layer (9)  

 
extending from a point (P1) in the tread portion (2) 

on each side of the tyre equator (C) towards the 
sidewall portion (3) over the belt edge, said point 

(P1) being spaced apart from the tyre equator (C) 

such that, when a straight line is drawn normal to 
the tread surface through the point (P1), the 

distance measured along the tread surface (2) from 
the tyre equator (C) to the normal line is in the 

range of from 0.2 to 0.3 times the tread surface 
width WT measured along the tread surface from one 

tread edge (E1) to the other tread edge (E2), each 
reinforcing cord layer (9) comprises a ply of 

parallel organic fibre cords (14) inclined at an 
angle of 20 to 70 degrees to the tyre equator, said 

ply being rubberised with a topping rubber having a 
100% modulus of 25 to 55kgf/cmÂ².

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic 
motorcycle tyre. Recently, as the expressway network is widely 
developed, the demand for high speed running of 
motorcycles is increasing. The radial tyres for such motorcycles were hitherto 
designed and manufactured on the same basis as 
radial tyres for a four-wheel vehicle, but such 
designs do not provide the cornering performance and 
straight running performance which are 
characteristic of a motorcycle. In particular, high 
speed steering stability has been inferior. A reason is that a conventional belt 1 reinforcing 
the tread portion was disposed in the same way as in 
the four-wheel vehicle tyre, inclined cords (b) at 
13 to 30 degrees to the tyre equator as shown in 
Fig.7(A). Such a belt (a) with inclined cords (b) was, as 
shown in Fig.7(B), formed by cutting a sheet (d) of 
tyre fabric having cords (b) extending in the  
 
longitudinal direction thereof, at the same angle as 
the inclination angle (alpha) required of the cords 
(d) of the belt (a), to form parallelopiped pieces 
(e), and linking them in a series, abutting the 
edges (f) of the pieces (e). Thus, the resultant belt (a) has abutting parts (f) 
extending obliquely to the tyre axial direction. As the length of the abutting part does not contact 
the ground simultaneously during running, handling 
is unstable, and the straight running performance is 
impeded. Further, during cornering, handling is 
also unstable. These problems occur particularly 
during high speed running. In order to solve part of these problems, a tyre 
having a belt formed by spirally winding a long 
narrow ribbon-shaped strip has been proposed for 
example in EP-A-0453294. In this tyre, shown in 
Fig.8, one ribbon-shaped strip (g) is wound 
continuously from one edge to the other edge of the 
belt (h). Therefore, the belt (h) has a uniform 
rigidity or a constant reinforcement for both the 
tread central region (j) and shoulder region (k).  
 On the other hand, as a motorcycle is greatly 
inclined during cornering unlike a four-wheel 
vehicle, a larger camber thrust must be generated 
during cornering. The above-mentioned tyre with its uniformly 
reinforced tread portion gives improved straight 
running performance, but the tread portion is liable 
to collapse under the lateral force applied during 
cornering, and the cornering performance is 
deteriorated. This phenomenon is particularly notable when the 
belt is formed by spirally winding a ribbon-shaped 
strip. As the ribbon-shaped strip is wound spirally,
