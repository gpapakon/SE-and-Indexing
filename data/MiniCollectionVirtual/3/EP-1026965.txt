<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a melon juice concentrate which is useful as a component in melon juice comprising beverages. Typically such beverage comprises an organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavour which is imported with the melon juice concentrate. In contrast the melon juice concentrate according to the present invention is free of organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavours. The present invention also relates to a process for providing the melon juice concentrate and a beverage comprising the melon juice concentrate. The melon juice concentrate being provided by the following process steps in the indicated order providing a liquid melon extract slurry; adjusting said liquid melon extract slurry to a pH of 4 or less; treating said pH adjusted melon slurry with a pectinase enzyme; clarifying said enzyme treated slurry by filtration to have at least a clarity of 95 % at 630 nanometers wavelength of light to provide a clear liquid; concentrating said clear liquid by heating to remove water and to remove aroma components to a level without detectable organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavour to provide said melon juice concentrate; wherein all process steps are carried out such that the oxygen content in the liquid phase of said liquid melon extract slurry, said clear liquid and said melon juice concentrate is maintained below 4 ppm.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MELON JUICEField of the inventionThe present invention relates to a melon juice concentrate which is useful as a component in melon juice comprising beverages. Typically such beverage comprise an organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavour which is imported with the melon juice concentrate. In contrast the melon juice concentrate according to the present invention is free of organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavours. The present invention also relates to a process for providing the melon juice concentrate and a beverage comprising the melon juice concentrate.Background of the inventionThe use of melon as a source for fruit juices which are used alone or in combination with other juices in beverages is known. A typical problem of such compositions is however that the melon juice component typically generates a cucumber flavour which is not acceptable to many potential consumers of juice comprising beverages. Therefore the inclusion of melon juice has not found commercial application other than in fruit juices having either an exceptionally low quantity of melon juice or comprising a large variety of other flavours which could mask the melon juice component.It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a melon juice concentrate which is free of or at least low enough in organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavours that when the melon concentrate is added to a fruit juice comprising beverage it does not cause the beverage to have a organoleptically recognisable cucumber taste or flavour. It is another objective of the present invention to devise a process for providing such a melon juice concentrate by use of conventionally available and therefore relatively inexpensive process steps and equipment requirements . 

Summary of the inventionThe present invention relates to a melon juice concentrate which is usable as a component in beverages which beverages are free of organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavours when the melon juice concentrate is used in the beverage in a quantity which provides the beverage with a melon detectable flavour. The melon juice concentrate is prepared by use of the following process steps in the indicated order- providing a liquid melon extract slurry,- adjusting the slurry to a pH of 4 or less,- treating the pH adjusted slurry with a pectinase enzyme,- clarifying the enzyme treated slurry by filtration in order to provide a clear liquid, the filtration being such as to provide clarity of 95% at 630 nano meters wave length of light,-

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1.) A melon juice concentrate usable as a component in beverages which are free of organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavours, said melon juice concentrate being provided by the following process steps in the indicated order
- providing a liquid melon extract slurry;
- adjusting said liquid melon extract slurry to a pH of 4 or less;
- treating said pH adjusted melon slurry with a pectinase enzyme; - clarifying said enzyme treated slurry by filtration to have at least a clarity of 95 % at 630 nano meters wave length of light to provide a clear liquid;
- concentrating said clear liquid by heating to remove water and to remove aroma components to a level without detectable organoleptically objectionable cucumber flavour to provide said melon juice concentrate;
wherein all process steps are carried out such that the oxygen content in the liquid phase of said liquid melon extract slurry, said clear liquid and said melon juice concentrate is maintained below 4 ppm.
2.) A concentrate according to claim 1 wherein said liquid melon extract slurry is provided by
- providing ripe melon fruits
- washing said fruits - extracting the fruit mark from said fruits
- finishing said fruit extract
- centrifugation of said finished fruit extract.
3.) A concentrate according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said enzyme treated slurry is subjected to pasteurisation prior to said clarification step.
4.) A concentrate according to any of the preceding claims wherein said pH adjustment step is provided by adding the appropriate amount of citric acid.
5.) A concentrate according to any of the preceding claims wherein said oxygen content is kept below 4 ppm by injection of nitrogen into all equipment open to the environment. 

6.) A concentrate according to any of the preceding claims 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein said oxygen content is kept below 4 ppm by filling the hold tanks used in the process from the bottom (bottom fill).
7.) A concentrate according to any of the preceding claims wherein said resulting concentrate in substantially free of 2,6 - Nonadienal and (E, Z) - 2,6 - Nonadienal, such that a beverage comprising 1 -10 % melon juice derived from said melon juice concentrate does not have an organoleptically detectable cucumber flavour.
