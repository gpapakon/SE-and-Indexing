<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for controlling an engine for motor vehicles, having an engine control device (11) for controlling engine functions, in particular the fuel injection and/or fuel pump, which engine control unit (11) has an input which serves to evaluate distance signals and is capable of processing signals whose time can be varied, the engine control unit (11) being used at the same time as an immobilizer (starting inhibitor) such that the input with microprocessor and port serves during the starting phase, i.e. when the vehicle is not moving, for reading in and evaluating an encoded signal (16).

Anti-theft device for motor vehicles with an electronic 
engine control device (11) comprising at least one input 

for signals not needed at the starting stage which operates 
on a microprocessor with port, the microprocessor being 

capable of processing signals which are variable in time, 
and with a contact breaker circuit, so that the engine 

control device (11) is simultaneously used as an 
immobiliser (starting lock) such that at least one function 

of the engine control device (11) essential to operation 
can be locked, characterised in that the existing input 

with microprocessor and port serves during the starting 
stage, i.e. when the vehicle is not moving, to read in and 

analyse a coded signal (16). 
Anti-theft device for motor vehicles according to claim 
1, characterised in that an anti-drive-off control device 

(14) is provided, via which the coded signals (16) are fed 
to the input of the engine control device (11). 
Anti-theft device for motor vehicles according to either 
of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the input of the 

engine control device (11) is an input for distance signals 
(12, 13). 
Anti-theft device for motor vehicles according to claim 
3, characterised by a design of the anti-drive-off control 

device (14) such that the latter recognises the authorised 
driver when the ignition is switched on, thereupon via its 

electronics (15) interrupts the input passed through the 
anti-drive-off control device (14) for the distance signal 

(12, 13) and via this input feeds the coded signal (16) to 
the engine control device (11).  

 
Anti-theft device for motor vehicles according to claim 
4, characterised in that the interrupted input for the 

distance signal (12, 13) can be connected again by the 
anti-drive-off control device (14) only if the coded signal 

(16) fed to the engine control device (11) after comparison 
with a code stored in the engine control device (11) has 

been recognised as matching and the functions of the 
control device (11) essential to operation have thereupon 

been released. 
Anti-theft device for motor vehicles according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterised in that a 

frequency code serves as a coded signal (16). 
Anti-theft device for motor vehicles according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterised in that in the 

key head of an ignition key (20) is arranged a transponder 
(21) which has an identification code and in that on the 

ignition lock (17) is mounted an aerial (18, 19) which is 
excited by the transponder (21), such that the identification 

code can be read without the battery.
