<ABSTRACT>
A lever connector includes a connector housing (21) 
having interfitting engagement with a counterpart connector 

housing (11) and accommodating a plurality of terminals and 
a locking lever (30) mounted on the connector housing (21) 

so as to be displaced between a lock position where the 
connector housing (21) and the counterpart connector housing 

(11) interfit each other and a release position where the 
counterpart connector housing (11) is disengaged from the 

connector housing (21). The connector housing (21) is 
engaged with the counterpart connector housing (11) when the 

locking lever (30) is displaced from the release position to 
the lock position. A concavo-convex engagement mechanism 

(31a, 26) includes a concave or convex member (31a) formed 
on the connector housing (21) and a convex or concave member 

(26b) formed on the locking lever (30). The concave and the 
convex members (31a, 26b) are engaged with each other when 

the locking lever (30) assumes the lock position, so that 
the connector housing (21) and the locking lever (30) are 

locked. A lock control mechanism allows the concavo-convex 
engagement mechanism (31a, 26) to lock the connector housing 

(21) and the locking lever (30) when abutting against the 
counterpart connector housing (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lever connector having a
locking lever for locking a counterpart connector, and more
particularly to such a lever connector in which the locking
lever is held at a lock position by an engagement mechanism.JP-U-05 090 845 or JP-A-05 090 843 disclose lever connectors
of the above-described type.Referring to Fig. 14 illustrating the lever connector
according to JP-U-05 090 845, a connector housing 1 includes
a cylindrical bottomed hood 2 into which a housing
of a counterpart connector is inserted for interfitting engagement
of the connectors. The hood 2 has two shafts 2a
projecting from the opposite side walls thereof. A generally
U-shaped locking lever 3 includes a base 3a and two
arms 3b formed by bending both ends of the base 3a by 90°
respectively. The locking lever 3 is first placed astraddle
the hood 2 and the shafts 2a are then inserted into bearing
holes 3bl formed through the arms 3a, respectively, so that
the locking lever 3 is rotatably mounted on the hood 2.Each arm 3 has a whirlpooling groove 3b2 formed in its
inner face. Protrusions formed on the counterpart connector
housing are guided into the grooves 3b2 and the locking
lever 3 is then rotatively moved so that the counterpart
connector housing is further guided along the whirlpooling
grooves 3b2 into the hood 2. Each arm 3 further has a radially
extending stripe-like projection 3c formed on its
outer face. Upon rotative movement of the locking lever 3,
the arms 3b are rotatively moved with the bearing holes 3b1
as fulcrums. When having been rotatively moved to a lock
position so that the counterpart connector housing has completely
enclosed in the hood 2, the projections 3c are substantially
parallel to the direction in which the counterpart 
connector housing is inserted into the hood through
its open end.Further, the hood 2 has two locking arms 2b formed on
the opposite side walls thereof respectively. The locking
arms 2b cover the respective projections 3c when the locking
lever 3 has been rotatively moved such that the projections
3c are parallel to the hood 2. Each locking arm 2b
has a claw formed on its inner face being engageable with
the projection 3c. Accordingly, the counterpart connector
housing is drawn into the hood 2 upon the rotative movement
of the locking lever 3, and the projections 3c of the locking
lever 3 are engaged with the locking arms 2b respectively
when the locking lever 3 has assumed the final or
lock position, whereupon the lever 3 is held at the lock
position.In the above-described

A lever connector having interfitting engagement
with a counterpart connector and comprising:


a housing (21) on which a locking lever (30) is
mounted so as to be displaced between a lock position where

the connector housing (21) and a housing (11) of the counterpart
connector are in engagement with each other and a

release position where the counterpart connector housing
(11) is disengaged from the connector housing (21), so that

the connector housing (21) is engaged with the counterpart
connector housing (11) when the locking lever (30) is displaced

from the release position to the lock position; and
an engagement and locking mechanism (31a, 26) including

a locking or engagement member (31a) provided on the
connector housing (21) and an engagement or locking member

(26b) provided on the locking lever (30), the engagement
and locking members (31a, 26b) being engaged with each

other when the locking lever (30) assumes the lock position,
thereby locking the locking lever (30) at the lock

position,

   characterized by

urging means (34) for shifting said locking lever (30)
relative to said connector housing (21), when said connector

housing (21) is not engaged with the counterpart connector
housing (11) thereby blocking to reach the interfitting engagement ; and
a lock control mechanism (14, 32b1) allowing the engagement
and locking mechanism (31a, 26) to lock the connector

housing (21) and the locking lever (30) when there
is engagement with the counterpart connector housing (11)

by overcoming the shifting of said locking lever (30)
caused by said urging means (34).
The lever connector according to claim 1, characterized

26b) of the engagement and locking mechanism (31a, 26) are
displaced between first relative positions where the locking
