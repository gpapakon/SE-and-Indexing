<ABSTRACT>
In a feeding installation for pigs, with a two-door feeding cage (3) forming a part of a separation (8) between the holding regions (1, 2) of two animal groups which are to be kept separate, a feed dispensing device assigned to a feed trough (7), and a control arrangement which controls the feed dispensing arrangement and preferably also door locking or actuating arrangements so that an animal situated in the feeding cage (3) and entitled to receive feed obtains a feed ration, a longitudinal separation (12), which runs through the cage and is adjustable between the side walls (4), separating the two animal groups in the cage region also and, according to position, allows access to the feed trough region in each case to one animal of one or other animal group, the feeding cage (3), which in each case receives only a single animal of one animal group, is designed as a run-through cage which defines a straight run-through path between in each case a single entrance door and exit door (5, 6). Adjoining the feeding cage (3) are separating elements (9, 10) which are pivotable in the manner of change-over flaps and are connected and can be actuated together via the longitudinal separation (12) running through the cage so that, in their one end pivot position with the longitudinal separation (12) lying in the vicinity of one side wall (4) of the feeding cage, they open the entrance and exit door (5, 6) to one holding region and, in the other end pivot position with the separation (12) located in the vicinity of the other side wall of the feeding cage, they open the entrance and exit door to the other holding region (2).
