<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for radial holding of the wrapper of the tube bundle and the support plates of a steam generator, consisting of stops penetrating the wall of the bundle wrapper and fixed to this wall at the support plates, the stops being distributed at the periphery of each support plate in order radially to separate the bundle wrapper from the pressure casing of the steam generator. Each stop comprises a first part (31) fixed onto the bundle wrapper (6), placed in contact with the internal face of the pressure casing (1), and a second part (32) exerting a rigid holding constraint on the support plate via elastic means.

<CLAIMS>
Steam generator incorporating a pressure envelope (11) elongated in
accordance with a given axis, an envelope of the steam generator tube bundle

also being elongated according to the same axis and contained in the
pressure envelope so as to leave an annular space between the two envelopes,

spacer plates (13) being located at given intervals and transversely to the
said axis within the bundle envelope in order to support the said tubes by

means of a holding device, the holding device being constituted by abutments
traversing the bundle envelope wall and fixed to said wall level with

the spacer plates, the abutments being distributed on the periphery of each
spacer plate in order to radially separate the bundle envelope from the

pressure envelope and so as to exert rigid holding stresses between the
spacer plates and the bundle envelope, each abutment having a first part

(31) fixed to the bundle envelope (6) and incorporating means permitting
their optional sliding on the inner face of the pressure envelope according

to said axis and means for varying their radial dimension with respect to
said axis, each abutment also having a second part (32) radially displaceable

with respect to the first part, with means for exerting said rigid
holding stress on the spacer plate, fixing means being provided for

immobilizing the second part (32) with respect to the bundle envelope after
contacting the second part (32) and the spacer plate, characterized in that

each abutment comprises means for bringing the second part (32) into contact
with the corresponding spacer plate 
(13) by introducing a fluid between
the second part (32) and the first part (31).
Steam generator according to claim 1, characterized in that the first
part (31) has a cavity (35) housing the second part (32) forming a piston

in said cavity, said fluid being introduced into the cavity, in the space
between the first part (31) and the second part (32).
Steam generator according to claim 2, characterized in that said fluid
is introduced by a duct (42) traversing the second part (32).
Steam generator comprising a pressure envelope (1) elongated in accordance
with a given axis, a steam generator tube bundle envelope, also 

elongated in accordance with the same axis and contained in the pressure
envelope so as to leave an annular space between the two envelopes, spacer

plates (13) being positioned at given intervals and transversely with
respect to said axis in the bundle envelope in order to support said tubes

by means of a holding device, the holding device being constituted by
abutments traversing the wall of the bundle envelope and fixed to said wall

at the spacer plates, the abutments being distributed on the periphery of
each spacer plate so as to radially separate the bundle envelope from the

pressure envelope and to exert rigid holding stresses between the spacer
plates and the bundle envelope, each abutment having a first part (31)

fixed to the bundle envelope (6) and comprising means permitting the possible
sliding thereof on the inner face of the pressure envelope in accordance

with said axis and means for varying their radial dimension relative to
said axis, each abutment also having a second part (32), which is radially

displaceable with respect to the first part and having means for exerting
said rigid holding stress on the spacer plate, fixing means being provided

for immobilizing the second part (32) with respect to the bundle envelope
after contacting the second part (32) and the spacer plate (13), characterized

in that the means for varying the radial dimension with respect to said
axis are constituted by elastic means linking the second part (32) to the

first part (31) and tending to move aside the second part from said first
part in a radial direction with respect to said axis between a first position

corresponding to a minimum radial dimension of the abutment and a
second position corresponding to contact with the spacer plate (13).
Steam generator according to claim 4, characterized in that the elastic
means comprise a spring (45) positioned between the first part (31) and the

second part (32).
Steam generator according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the means permitting the optional sliding of an abutment on the

inner face of the pressure envelope and the means for varying their radial
dimension are constituted by at least one screw (38) screwed into the first

part (31), the contact between said screw (38) and the inner face of the
pressure envelope (1) taking place along a cambered end (39) of the screw. 
Steam generator according to any one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that said fixing means are constituted by a weld made between the first

part (31) and the second part (32).
Steam generator according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the contact between the second part (32) and the spacer plate

(13) takes place along a large bearing surface of the second part exerting
a pressure on the edge of the spacer plate.
