<ABSTRACT>
Each section has a number of drainage and ventilation openings passing through it. It is in two mating halves (9,10) joined together at their edges and pref. sealed against penetration by liquid disinfectant. It can be formed by deep-drawing, perforation and/or stamping. The halves can be joined together by soldering, folding or beading their edges or by a laser weld seam and a joint can be enclosed between them. The weld seam can be masked by sheet-metal, and as a further alternative they can be glued together.
