<ABSTRACT>
An oscillating vane (1) for a rotary actuator is proposed. The oscillating vane (1) has a bearing part (2) via which it is connected to or can be connected to an output shaft. It can be swivelled about a rotation axis (7) coinciding with the longitudinal axis of the output shaft. An axial seal (24) serving to provide a seal relative to the housing of the rotary actuator is provided on at least one axial side of the bearing part (2). The axial seal (24) is designed like a ring so as to be closed upon itself and extends along a circular line (25) with the rotation axis (7) as centre. In plan view (26) as viewed in the direction of the rotation axis (7), the axial seal (24) has a meander-shaped peripheral extension, and the resulting intermediate seal spaces (37, 38) lying radially on the outside and inside overlap radially.

Rotary piston for mounting in the housing of a rotary drive 
(5) and connected or connectable to an output shaft (12) which 

passes through the housing (4) in the area of a bearing section 
(2), and which is pivotable around a rotation axis (7) coinciding 

with the longitudinal axis (6) of the output shaft (12), wherein 
the bearing section (2) is provided in the area of one or more 

axial sides with an axial seal (24) serving to seal against the 
housing (4), and which is self-contained in annular form and 

extends along a circular curve (25) with the rotation axis (7) 
as centre, characterized in that the axial seal (24), seen in 

plan view (26) in the direction of the rotation axis (7), has a 
meandering circumferential course, wherein the radially outer and 

radially inner seal intermediate spaces (37, 38) thereby 
obtained, radially overlap. 
Rotary piston according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
seal intermediate spaces (38) on the radial inside communicate 

with an annular space (45) adjoining their radial inside and 
arranged coaxially to the rotation axis (7). 
Rotary piston according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the radially outer seal intermediate spaces (37) are open 

on the radial outside so that, when they are installed in the 
housing (4) in the operationally-ready state of the rotary piston 

(1), they are able to communicate with the housing space (8) 
accommodating the rotary piston.  

 
Rotary piston according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the axial seal (24) is moulded on to a 

sleeve-like circumferential seal (28) which encompasses the 
bearing section (2) in the area of its circumferential surface 

(27), and is formed integrally with a blade seal (19) located on 
one blade (3) of the rotary piston (1). 
Rotary piston according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that an axial seal (24, 24') with a meandering 

circumferential course is provided in the area of both ends of 
the bearing section (2).
