<ABSTRACT>
Paperboard of the kind used for making business cards, 
invitation cards, menu cards, report covers and the like is 

surface enhanced by the application of a low coatweight 
(typically 1 to 5 g m ⁻²) coating of (a) a pigment having an 

oil absorbency of at least about 80 g/ 100 g pigment, and 
(b) a binder. The pigment is preferably an aluminosilicate, 

a symthetic amorphous silica, a calciumed kaolin, or an 
acid-washed montmorillonite clay, and the binder is 

preferably a styrene-butadiene latex. The coating reduces 
set-off and enhances print density after offset printing 

whilst not substantially affecting the aesthetic character 
of the product compared with conventional uncoated 

paperboard.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to paperboards of the kind used for
making business cards, invitation cards, menu cards, covers
for reports and such like. Such paperboards are often
referred to as Ivory Boards or Bristols. They are typically
woodfree products having a grammage of 200 to 400 g m-2 or
more, a thickness of 250 to 380 µm or more, and a calendered
smooth surface finish (by a "woodfree product" is meant a
product which consists essentially of chemical rather than
mechanical pulp). 200 g m -2 and 250 µm are not to be taken
as absolute minimum values for grammage and thickness
respectively of paperboards of the kind referred to - the
expression "paperboard" as used in this specification
extends at least to products of 180 g m -2 grammage and 150
µm thickness.Products of the kind just referred to normally have to be
printed, and it is important therefore that the paperboard
stock from which they are cut should have good printability
characteristics, in particular low set-off and ink-rub.
"Set-off" refers to transfer of still-wet ink from a printed
card to the underside of the next card above it in a stack.
"Ink rub" refers to the tendency of still-wet ink printed on
the card to smudge when in sliding or rubbing contact with
another surface, for example the underside of the next card
above it in a stack.Conventionally, paperboard of the above-mentioned kind is
surface sized, typically with starch, but is otherwise
uncoated and is calendered to a smooth surface finish. This
smooth surface finish increases the tendency for set-off and
ink rub to occur, since there are no pronounced "hill and
valley" surface features. "Hills" on adjacent sheets tend
to prevent ink in the "valleys" from contacting and
transferring to an adjacent sheet and also serve to shield 
ink in the "valleys" from rubbing forces.The occurrence of set-off and ink rub has in the past often
been thought to be in part a consequence of the smooth
compacted surface produced by the calendering operation -
this surface was thought to "hold out" the applied ink, i.e.
to retard its absorption, and thus to make it more
susceptible to set-off or smudging.We have found however that conventional uncoated paperboard
is in fact relatively absorbent, despite its smooth
compacted surface, and that this is a major factor in the
occurrence of set-off and ink rub.Ink setting on paper products generally is usually the
result of two complementary processes : absorption of the
non-drying fraction of the ink, i.e. thin oil(s), often
containing anti-oxidants to

absorbency of at least about 80 g/100 g pigment,

and (b) a binder, said coatweight being from 1 to 5 g m
-2
.
An improved printability paperboard as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the high oil absorbency pigment

has an oil absorbency of at least 90 g/100 g
pigment.
An improved printability paperboard as claimed in
any preceding claim wherein the high oil absorbency

pigment is an aluminosilicate, a synthetic
amorphous silica, a calcined kaolin, or an acid-washed

montmorillonite clay.
An improved printability paperboard as claimed in
any preceding claim wherein the binder is a

styrene-butadiene latex.
An improved printability paperboard as claimed in
any preceding claim wherein the dry ratio of high

oil absorbency pigment to binder is at least 2:1,
preferably at least 3:1.

any preceding claim wherein the paperboard has a

grammage of at least 180 g m
-2
, preferably 200 to
400 g m
-2

any preceding claim, wherein the paperboard has a

thickness of at least 150 µm, preferably 250 µm to
380 µm.
An improved printability paperboard as claimed in
any preceding claim, wherein the paperboard is

woodfree in nature.
The use, for the purpose of improving the
printabilty of an ivory board, Bristol or similar paperboard or the kind used for

making business cards, invitation cards, menu
cards, report covers and the like, of a low

coatweight coating of (a) a pigment having an oil
absorbency of at least about 80 g/100 g pigment,

and (b) a binder, said coatweight being from 1 to 5 gm
