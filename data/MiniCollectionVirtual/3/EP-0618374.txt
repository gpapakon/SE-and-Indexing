<ABSTRACT>
A toggle fastener (Figure 1) as a hasp lever 22 
pivoted on a first axis on mounting plate 10, and 

pivotally mounting bail 24 28 on a second axis 30. The 
bail is to engage in jaw 26 in keeper 14 and when the 

plate 10, bail 24 and lever 22 are all substantially 
parallel - which is the secured position of the fastener 

- lugs 32 provided on the hasp 22 lie closely adjacent to 
the bail between axis 30 and the axis of the keeper 

engaged end, and serve to prevent or limit pivotal 
movement of the bail about either end. This enables the 

fastener to be used to secure panels in place.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to toggle fasteners.A toggle fastener may be defined as one which
comprises two components to be fixed on the respective
parts namely a mounting plate and a keeper which are to
be releasably fastened together. The plate provides a
pivotal mounting on a first axis for a hasp lever, and
the latter provides a pivotal mounting on a second axis
for a bail, claw or other component (herein called
'bail') which is apt to engage with the keeper. The
first axis lies between the keeper and the second axis
when the fastener is engaged. In the engaged position, a
line of engagement between the keeper and bail may be
generally co-planar with the first and second axes, but
usually the design is such that the second axis crosses a
plane containing the said line of engagement and the
first axis during the final stage of a fastener closing
movement and this 'overcentre' movement provides a
security of fastening, that is holds the fastener in the
closed position against inadvertent release. Additional
security means may be provided for example in the form of
a catch which has to be moved against a spring before
the hasp can be returned overcentre to release the bail,
or in the form of a lug which extends through a movable
part and is apertured to take a padlock or seal. A
toggle fastener as defined in the foregoing words (with
or without the additional security means) is
conveniently called "of the kind referred to" and
represents the starting point of the present invention. Fasteners
of this type are described in GB-A-696 234, GB-A-1 221 664 and GB-A-708 385.The problem with fasteners of the kind referred to
is that in the engaged position one or other end of the
bail may act as a hinge and allow relative movement of
the parts which are secured. Thus for example a panel
fixed by toggle fasteners on opposite edges may vibrate
with the respective bails acting as swinging links.
Simple toggle fasteners are not recommended for this kind
of use for this reason, although they are often so used
and are maligned when they do not perform as expected. The object of the invention is to solve this
problem.According to the invention, a toggle fastener of the
kind referred to is provided with means for preventing
pivotal movement of the bail on the hasp in at least one
direction, independent of the overcentre action, and when
the fastener is in a secured position.In one possibility, the pivoting is prevented by the
provision of projections on the hasp which can engage the
bail between the second axis and the

<CLAIMS>
A toggle fastener comprising a mounting plate (10) and a keeper (14),
a hasp lever (22) pivoted to the mounting plate on a first axis (20) near to the

keeper, and a bail (28) for engagement with the keeper pivoted to the hasp lever on a second axis (30) more
remote from the keeper when the fastener is in an engaged position, characterised by

means (32; 50,52) preventing pivotal movement of the bail in at least one
direction and about at least one end of the bail when the fastener is in secured

position.
A toggle fastener as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the hasp is provided
with at least one lateral projection (32) disposed so that when the fastener is

secured said projection lies between the ends of the bail in proximity thereto
so as to be abutted by the bail and prevent movement of the bail.
A toggle fastener as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the hasp is provided
with a pair of oppositely extending lateral projections (32) and said projections

are located so as to be in close juxtaposition to the plane of said mounting
plate (10) when the fastener is in said secured position.
A toggle fastener as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said mounting plate
is provide with a projection (50) arranged so as to abut the bail (28) when the

fastener is in said secured position.
A toggle fastener as claimed in Claim 4 wherein said projection (50)
is located at the end of the mounting plate (10) adjacent the keeper, and in said

secured position lies coplanar with said keeper (14) and in a recess (52) in said
keeper whereby the projection and keeper together serve for lateral location of

the parts. 
A toggle fastener as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the bail (28)

comprises a transversely extending portion engaged with said keeper (14) and
said projection (50) underlies said transversely extending portion in the secured

position of the fastener.
