<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain indole derivatives, 
processes for their preparation, compositions containing such 
compounds and their use as fungicides for the control of 
phytopathogenic fungi. Indole derivatives having specific useful activities are well 
known. For instance, in French patent FR 2260332 certain 
3-substituted derivatives of 1-phenyl-2-aminocarbonylindole having 
pharmaceutical activity are described. In German patent application 
DE 2008692 certain 3-aminocarbonylindole derivatives having 
herbicidal and pharmaceutical activity are described. From Japanese 
patent applications J5 0070357 and J5 0070358 1,3-disubstituted 2-aminoacetylindole 
derivatives and 1,3-disubstituted 2-(3-aminopropionyl)indole 
derivatives are known. These derivatives have 
antifungal as well as pharmaceutical activity. Additionally, 
DE 1966206 discloses 5-chloro-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxamide 
as an intermediate in the preparation of 
certain 1,4-benzodiazepines which are useful as pharmaceuticals. 
There is no indication that this compound has any fungicidal 
activity. It has now been found that certain new indole derivatives, 
especially indole derivatives which are unsubstituted at the 
3-position, show excellent fungicidal activity, particularly 
against Phytophthorainfestans and Plasmoporaviticola.According to the present invention there is therefore provided 
a fungicidal composition which comprises a carrier and, as active 
ingredient, a compound of the general formula 
  
 
in which 
R represents a substituted phenyl group; 
R3 and R4independently represent a hydrogen or halogen 
atom or an optionally substituted C1-12 alkyl, 
C1-12 alkoxy, C3-8 cycloalkyl, phenyl or 
phenoxy group; R5 and R6independently represent a hydrogen atom or an 
optionally substituted C1-12 alkyl, 
C1-12 alkoxy, C3-8 cycloalkyl, phenyl or 
3- to 6-membered heterocyclyl group or R5 and 
R6 together with the interjacent nitrogen atom 
represent a 3- to 6-membered heterocyclyl 
group; 
and R7represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-12 alkyl 
group;  
optional substituents being selected from halogen atoms, 
nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, C1-12 alkyl, C1-12 haloalkyl, C1-12 
alkoxy, C1-12 haloalkoxy, C1-12 hydroxyalkyl, amino, C1-12 
alkylamino, di-C1-12 alkylamino, formyl, C1-12 
alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl, C1-12 alkanoyl, C1-12 alkylthio, 
C1-12 alkylsulphinyl, C1-12 alkylsulphonyl, carbamoyl, C1-12 
alkylamido, phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl, benzyloxy, C1-12 
alkylenedioxy and optionally substituted C3-8 cycloalkyl
