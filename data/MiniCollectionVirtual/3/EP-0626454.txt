<ABSTRACT>
A method for the identification of agents which 
inhibit spindle pole body formation or function, thus 

exhibiting selective fungicidal activity, involves the 
incubation of test samples in cultures of a 
Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae
 strain that produces excess numbers of spindle 
pole bodies. Cultures containing samples that inhibit 

spindle pole bodies exhibit enhanced growth because the 
growing yeast is rescued from the adverse effects of 

excess spindle bodies. In the preferred practice of the 
invention, the test sample is added to a 
S. cerevisiae
 
culture or culture area containing a strain that has a 

conditional mutation producing excess spindle pole bodies, 
such as diploid esp1-1 strains. The culture or culture 

area is preincubated under permissive conditions wherein 
the strain can grow to some extent, and then conditions 

are shifted to restrictive conditions so that the mutant 
strain either cannot grow or grows poorly. The extent of 

growth in the culture or culture area containing test 
sample is then compared with the extent of growth in the 

absence of test sample, and the presence of spindle pole 
body inhibition is determined by observation of whether 

culture growth in the presence of test sample exceeds 
growth in its absence. Preferred embodiments employ test 

samples on disks or in wells in solidified cultures, 
facilitating easy visual inspection of growth. A presumptive 

spindle pole body inhibitor, identified in random 
screening, is used as a positive control which can be 

compared to the test sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screening method for the
identification of agents that inhibit spindle pole body
formation and/or function and more particularly relates to
a screening method for the identification of potential
fungicides that inhibit spindle pole body formation and/or
function.The search for agents which can effectively act
against fungi and mycoses injurious to plants and animals
in a suitably selective manner such that the host plant or
animal is not significantly harmed can be an expensive and
time-consuming process. A significant degree of trial and
error normally is required in order to ascertain even
potential candidates among a wide variety of possibilities,
and thereafter to further determine whether those
with potential in fact exhibit the requisite activity and
selectivity suitable for commercial use. Much advantage
could be realized were it possible to provide a relatively
rapid and precise method for screening a wide variety of
possible agents based upon some specific characteristic or
property useful as a predictor of anti-fungal activity and
fungal specificity. Apart from the evident economic
advantages, a method of this type would enable larger
universes of possible agents to be screened, with corresponding
increased potential for identifying particularly
suitable fungicides. This is particularly important as
increasing numbers of injurious fungi are becoming resistant
to commercially available fungicides (Koeller, W.,
and Scheinpflug, H., Plant Disease, 71: 1066-1074 (1987)). As discussed in detail hereinafter, the present invention
provides a screening process which is based upon
the finding that chemical and biological agents having
fungicidal activity can be identified based upon their
ability to inhibit spindle pole body formation and/or
function in yeast strains that otherwise overproduce
spindle pole bodies.The accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis
is essential for normal eukaryotic cell division, and
precisely organized complex microtubule arrays are required
during this process so that reproduction is faithful.
Chromosome segregation is mediated by the mitotic
spindle apparatus which comprises the spindle microtubules,
the kinetochore (a structure attaching spindle
fibers to chromosomes), and the spindle pole, which organizes
the microtubules. In mammals and some other organisms,
the spindle pole equivalent is the centrosome; it
comprises the centrosphere and a pair of centrioles. In
yeast and other fungi, the spindle pole is called the
spindle pole

<CLAIMS>
A screening method for identifying fungicides, said method comprising:

(a) adding a test sample to a culture of a 
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
 strain
that normally produces excess numbers of spindle pole bodies, thereby

providing a sample culture;
(b) incubating said sample culture for such time and under such conditions
sufficient to observe yeast cell growth; and
(c) comparing growth in said sample with a corresponding portion of a
control culture of said strain containing no test sample and identifying said

test sample as a fungicide by observation that the sample culture
produces greater growth than that observed in said control culture.
A method according to claim 1 wherein:

in step (a) said test sample is added to an area on a solidified culture of

Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
 which contains a conditional mutant strain of 
S.
cerevisiae
 which produces excess numbers of spindle pole bodies;
in step (b) incubating said culture by first preincubating said culture for such

time under permissive conditions sufficient to observe yeast cell growth by the
conditional mutant strain; and then incubating said culture for such time under

restrictive conditions sufficient to inhibit yeast cell growth by the conditional
mutant strain.
A method according to claim 2 wherein

in step (a) said solidified culture is a 
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
 strain
containing a conditional lethal temperature-dependent esp1-1 mutation which

produces excess numbers of spindle pole bodies;
in step (b) preincubating of said culture is conducted for such time under a 
permissive temperature and such other conditions sufficient to observe yeast

cell growth by the 
S. cerevisiae
 strain; and then
shifting the culture to a restrictive temperature and incubating for such time
under such conditions sufficient to observe continued yeast cell growth in the

vicinity of the positive control and a diminution or cessation of growth in the
absence of sample;
and said method further comprises comparing the observation with the
observation resulting from repeating the above steps for the same culture

containing as postive control a known spindle pole body inhibitor instead of
said test sample.
A method according to any one of claim 2 or claim 3 wherein said 
S.
cerevisiae
 strain is an esp1 mutant or a cdc-esp1 double mutant.
A method according to claim 4 wherein a 
S. cerevisiae
 mating factor is added
to the cultures prior to incubation.
A method according to claim 4 wherein said strain is a diploid 
S. cerevisiae

strain homozygous for a conditional lethal temperature-sensitive esp1-1
mutation.
A method according to claim 6 wherein said strain is SN127d.
