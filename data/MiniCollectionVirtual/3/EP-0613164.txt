<ABSTRACT>
A discharge chamber wherein the allowability for 
positional displacement of electrodes is increased to 

facilitate manufacture of the discharge chamber and a 
method of manufacturing the discharge chamber are 

disclosed. The discharge chamber has a flat panel 
structure wherein a first substrate and a second 

substrate are adhered to each other with a predetermined 
gap left therebetween. Striped anodes and cathodes are 

arranged alternately on the first substrate. Barrier 
ribs are interposed between the two substrates and 

arranged in a stripe pattern to partition the gap to 
form discharge channels. The anodes are arranged just 

below the barrier ribs and have a width dimension 
smaller than the width dimension of the barrier ribs. 

Meanwhile, each of the cathodes is arranged 
intermediately between each adjacent ones of the 

cathodes. Even if the barrier ribs suffer from relative 
positional displacement, the exposed surface area of the 

cathodes by which plasma discharge is dominated is kept 
fixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a discharge chamber 
incorporated in a plasma addressed display device or a 
like device and a method of manufacturing the same, and 
more particularly to an electrode structure of a 
discharge chamber having a linear discharge channel and 
a method of forming the electrode structure. A plasma addressed display device in which a 
discharge chamber having a linear discharge channel is 
incorporated is already known and disclosed, for 
example, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application No. 
Heisei 4-265931, which corresponds to U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/837,971 filed on February 20, 
1992 and assigned to the assignee of the present patent 
application. In order to clearly show the background of 
the invention, an outline of the structure of a 
conventional plasma addressed display device is 
described with reference to FIG. 5. The plasma 
addressed display device shown has a structure wherein a  
 
display chamber 51, a discharge chamber 52 and an 
intermediate substrate 53 are layered with each other 
with the intermediate substrate 53 interposed between 
the display chamber 51 and the discharge chamber 52. 
The display chamber 51 is constructed using an upper 
side glass substrate 54 and has a plurality of signal 
electrodes D formed in parallel to each other in the 
direction of a column of a matrix on an inner major 
surface thereof. The glass substrate 54 is adhered to 
the intermediate substrate 53 with a predetermined gap 
left therebetween by means of a spacer 55. A liquid 
crystal layer 56 is filled in the gap. Meanwhile, the 
discharge chamber 52 is constructed using a lower side 
glass substrate 57. A plurality of plasma electrodes 58 
are formed on an inner side major surface of the 
substrate 57 such that they extend in the direction of a 
row of the matrix perpendicularly to the signal 
electrodes D. The plasma electrodes 58 alternately 
functions as an anode A and a cathode K. A plurality of 
barrier ribs 59 are formed on and along the plasma 
electrodes 58. The barrier ribs 59 contact at the top 
ends thereof with the intermediate substrate 53 and 
serve as a spacer. The lower side glass substrate 57 is 
adhered to the intermediate substrate 53 by means of a  
 
seal member 60. An airtight enclosed space is defined 
between the lower side glass substrate 57 and the 
intermediate substrate 53. The space is partitioned by 
the striped barrier ribs 59 to construct discharge 
channels 61 which individually make row scanning units. 
Ionizable gas is
