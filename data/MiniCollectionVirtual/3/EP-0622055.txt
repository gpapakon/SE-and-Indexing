it also comprises an adaptor sleeve (5) interposed between the
container (1; 25; 36) and the cap (2; 30), said sleeve comprising

a filter (11) connected to the cap (2; 30) on one side and to the
collection container (1; 25; 36) on the other side and a suction

channel (21) intended to be connected to a source of vacuum in
order to produce in the container a vacuum intended to cause the

suction of the liquid through said filter (11).
Collection device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the adaptor sleeve (5) interposed between the container (1;

25; 36) and the cap (2; 30), comprises a chamber (10)
communicating with the cap (2; 30) in which the filter (11) for

the liquid is disposed, a pipe (16) for the suction of the liquid
comprising a first flared end portion (17) opening out at the

filter (11) and a second end portion (18) opening out in the
container through a projection (19) extending axially beyond the

end (20) of the sleeve facing the container and a suction channel
(21) intended to be connected to a source of vacuum and

terminating at the end (20) of the sleeve facing the container
in order to produce in the container (1; 25; 36) a vacuum

intended to cause the auction of the liquid through said filter
(11).
Collection device according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the collection container is a test tube (1)

and the adaptor sleeve (5) comprises a portion (8) engaged in the
test tube provided with annular seating ribs (9) inclined in the

direction of engagement of the adaptor sleeve (5) in the test
tube.
Collection device according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the collection container is an Erlenmeyer

flask (25) and the adaptor sleeve (5) comprises a portion engaged
in the neck (26) of the Erlenmeyer flask comprising a portion (7)

of frustoconical lateral surface and a portion (8) provided with
annular ribs (9), at least one O-ring (27) being mounted on said

portion (8) of the adaptor sleeve in a groove defined between two
of the ribs (9).
Collection device according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the collection container is a tubular

container of small section (36) and in that it comprises a
flexible sleeve (35) for the connection of said tubular container

(36) fitting in a sealed manner on the one hand on a portion (8)
of the adaptor sleeve (5) facing said container (36) and on the

other hand on the periphery of said container (36), the
projection (19) by which the suction tuba (16) of the adaptor

sleeve (5) opens into the container being engaged with a
clearance (37) in the neck of said container (36).
Collection device according to Claim 5, characterised in
that said collection container of small section (36) is a prebroken

ampoule.
Collection device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the cap (2) provided with the cannula for

the suction of liquid is a cover of flexible material mounted on
an outer side wall (6) of the adaptor sleeve provided with an

abutment flange (7).
Collection device according to Claim 7, characterised in

that it also comprises a bush (12) for fixing the filter (11),
