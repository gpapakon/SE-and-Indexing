<ABSTRACT>
In a dishwasher or washing machine, at least one open flow section (10) is included in a water supply pipe (7), as well as an ion exchange container (11). The water supply pipe leads into the washing container (2) which possesses, at the bottom, a drainage trough for collecting washing liquid. In order to achieve a high operating reliability for a simple construction in the case of the water supply and also in the event of steam shocks occurring in the washing container, one pipe part (12) of the supply pipe (36) leads into the drainage trough below the dynamic operating level (30) of the washing liquid, a collecting container (17) located above the static liquid level (28) being connected to the pipe part (12). In addition, the collecting container (17) has at least one pressure-compensating opening (24,25) leading to the open atmosphere and an overflow edge (26) above the static level (28).

Household appliance, such as a dishwasher or washing 
machine with a container (2) for the material to be 

cleaned and with a water supply line (7), in which at 
least one free flow path (10) and an ion exchange 

receptacle (11) are connected, and which subsequently 
opens into the container (2) and with a outflow trough 

(9) which is arranged at the base of the container (2), 
in which operating fluid collects and into which a line 

section (12) of the water supply line (7) opens beneath 
an operating level (30) of the operating fluid, 

characterised in that the operating level (30), beneath 
which the line section (12) of the water supply line (7) 

opens, is the dynamic operating level (30) of the 
operating fluid, a collecting receptacle (17) for 

operating fluid possibly escaping from the container (2) 
is connected to the line section and lied above the 

static fluid level (28), and the collecting receptacle 
(17) comprises at least one pressure balancing aperture 

(24, 25) opening to the free atmosphere and an overflow 
edge (16) above the static level (28) of the operating 

fluid in the container (2). 
Household appliance according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the collecting receptacle (17) is 

connected via a pipe socket (13), in which two ducts (20, 
21) extending parallel to one another are constructed, 

which open out axially into the line section (22) leading 
to the outflow trough (9), one of the ducts (20) is the 

connecting line to the collecting receptacle (17) and the 
other duct (21) is part of the line section (12) leading 

from the ion exchanger (11). 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that, downstream of the overflow edge  

 
(26) in the direction of flow, an outflow aperture (27) 

opens out freely above a leakage water collecting trough 
(4) engaging beneath the appliance fixtures. 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or one of 
the subsequent claims, characterised in that the overflow 

edge (26) is constructed on an upright overflow wall 
extending from the base (22) of the collecting receptacle 

(17), and a baffle wall (32) comprising an overflow 
aperture (33) in the base region is arranged in front of 

the overflow wall in the direction of the connecting line 
(20). 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or one of 
the subsequent claims, characterised in that a steam 

buffer chamber (18), which is defined by a cover wall 
(23) above the connecting line (20), is provided in the 

collecting receptacle (17), the cover wall (23) 
comprising a respective pressure balancing aperture (24, 

25) in the region of the base (22) and approximately at 
the height of the overflow edge (26). 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or one of 
the subsequent claims, characterised in that the line 

section (12, 21) leading away from the ion exchange 
receptacle (11) opens parallel to the connecting line 

(20) axially into the line section (22) which is 
connected to the outflow trough (9). 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or one of 
the subsequent claims, characterised in that a 

diametrally extending partition (19) is provided in the 
pipe socket (13). 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or one of 
the subsequent claims, characterised in that the water 

supply in the duct (21) connected to the ion exchanger  
 

(11) has a higher flow velocity than is present in the 
line section (22) to the outflow trough (9) with the same 

rate of flow. 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or one of 
the subsequent claims, characterised in that a safety 

switch device (5) is arranged downstream of the overflow 
edge (26) in the direction of flow.
