<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is novel compounds which are 2-heterocyclic-4,6-ditertiarybutyl-5-hydroxy-1,3-pyrimidines, where heterocyclic is selected from imidazole, thiazole, and oxazole, and pharmaceutically acceptable additional salts, bases, and base salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use therefor. The invention compounds are found to have activity as inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase and/or cyclooxygenase providing treatment of, for example, preferably inflammation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to novel
compounds which are 2-heterocyclic-5-hydroxy-1,3-pyrimidines
and pharmaceutically acceptable acid
addition or base salts thereof, pharmaceutical
compositions and methods of use therefor.
Particularly the invention is related to 2-thiazole,
2-oxazole, or 2-imidazole-5-hydroxy-1,3-pyrimidines.
The invention compounds have activity as inhibitors
of 5-lipoxygenase and/or cyclooxygenase providing
treatment of conditions advantageously affected by
such inhibition including, for example, rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis, other inflammatory
conditions, pain, fever, psoriasis, allergic
diseases, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, GI
ulcers, cardiovascular conditions including ischemic
heart disease and atherosclerosis, and
ischemia-induced cell damage, particularly brain
damage caused by stroke. They can also be used
topically for treating acne, sunburn, psoriasis, and
eczema. Also included are leukotriene mediated
pulmonary, gastrointestinal, inflammatory,
dermatological, and cardiovascular conditions. The
disclosed compounds also have potential utility as
antioxidants and as inhibitors of LDL into
macrophages. However, overall the preferable use is
to treat inflammatory conditions. Thus, the present
invention is also a pharmaceutical composition or
method of manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition
for the use of treating the noted conditions.3,5-Di-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxybenzene,
substituted by thiazoles, oxazoles, and imidazoles
are known to provide antiinflammatory activity, 
US Patent 4,636,516. 2-Substituted-5-hydroxy-1,3-pyrimidines
as antiinflammatory agents are also
described as copending US applications Serial
Numbers 07/648,115 of January 31, 1991, and
07/756,400 of September 9, 1991, respectively.Accordingly the present invention is a compound
