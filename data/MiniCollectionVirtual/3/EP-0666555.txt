<ABSTRACT>
The method involves setting each pixel to a defined voltage before transmitting a data pulse. The pixels are brought to a null voltage line by line. Alternatively, the pixels are brought to a voltage of equal polarity to the data pulse line by line. Alternatively, the pixels can be brought to the maximum voltage line by line and the data pulse can use the full voltage range between the maximum positive and minimum negative voltage as an amplitude modulated signal. The data pulses can alternatively be sent as pulse width modulated pulses with maximum amplitude but opposite polarity.
