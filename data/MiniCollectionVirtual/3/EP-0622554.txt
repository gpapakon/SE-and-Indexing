<ABSTRACT>
The nut has a locking portion concentric and adjacent to the tapped bore, and an elastic locking member secured in the axial direction in a neck on the nut, with which it is in frictional contact. This consists of a washer of thickness matching the thread pitch in the nut, and fitting in an annular groove in the neck. Its inside edge is tapped with the same thread as the nut but slightly offset in relation to the latter in the axial direction. Three symmetrical flats (28a,b,c) are formed in the outside edge of the washer. Notches (32a,b,c) are formed in the outside edge sections (30a,b,c) between the flats on the washer (10), their depth (t) in the radial direction being equal to or less than the max. depth of the flats in the same direction.

<CLAIMS>
A locknut, the screwthreaded portion of which 
is followed concentrically by a locking portion having 

an elastic axially fixed annular locking disc (10) 
which projects into the extension of the screwthreaded 

zone of the nut and which is frictionally held 
peripherally on a neck extension (42) of the nut, the 

annular locking disc having a thickness corresponding 
substantially to the nut screwthread pitch and 

engaging, by its outer peripheral zone, in an annular 
groove (43) of the neck extension, a screwthread which 

corresponds to the nut screwthread being cut at its 
inner edge (36) and being axially offset from the nut 

screwthread by a small amount less than the pitch of 
the nut screwthread, and three circle segments (28a, 

28b, 28c) in a symmetrical arrangement being cut away 
from the annular locking disc, characterised in that 

notches (32a, 32b, 32c) are formed in the peripheral 
zones (30a, 30b, 30c) of the annular disc (10) between 

the three circle segments (28a, 28b, 28c), the notch 
depth (t) being substantially equal to or smaller than 

the maximum radial depth of the circle segments (25a, 
25b, 25c). 
A locknut according to claim 1, characterised 
in that a notch (32a, 32b, 32c) with parallel walls is 

formed centrally in each peripheral zone (30a, 30b, 
30c). 
A locknut according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the width of the notches (32a, 32b, 32c) is  

 
between 1/4 and 1/3 of the peripheral extent of the 

respective associated peripheral zone (30a, 30b, 30c). 
A locknut according to any one of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the annular locking disc 

consists of spring steel.
