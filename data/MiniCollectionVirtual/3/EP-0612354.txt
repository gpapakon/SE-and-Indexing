<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus and methods for 
separation of target molecules including target 
nucleic acid sequences from oligonucleotides, and 
nucleotides and concentration and detection of the 
molecules. The use of amplification techniques in a procedure 
for detection of a target molecules that include target 
nucleic acid sequences is well known in the art. 
Typically, this procedure includes enzymatic 
amplification of target nucleic acid sequences and 
detection of the target molecules by gel 
electrophoresis followed by Southern blot procedures. A number of solid phase capture assays have also 
been developed to simplify the procedures for detection 
of target molecules including nucleic acid sequences. 
In these procedures two ligands are typically 
incorporated within amplified target nucleic acid 
sequences. A first ligand is used to capture, on a 
solid matrix, the target molecules that include the 
amplified target nucleic acid sequences and a second 
ligand is used to detect the target molecules by the 
binding of a signal producing reagent to this second 
ligand. Solid phase affinity capture assays, however, 
require an extended reaction time to capture a high 
proportion of target molecules in a reaction mixture 
(Sauvaigo et al., Nucleic Acid Research, 1990, Vol. 18, 
pp. 3175 - 3182). Furthermore, when capture is mediated 
by amplification primers incorporating a solid phase  
 
affinity ligand, the sensitivity of the assay may be adversely effected 
by competition between free primers and primers incorporated in the 
target nucleic acid sequences. The use of chromatography as a separation and concentration 
procedure is well known in the art. It has been reported that whereas DNA 
molecules are chromatographically mobile on moistened paper they fail to 
migrate when solutions are applied to dry paper (Bendich et al., Arch. 
Biochem. Biophys., 1961, 94, 417-423). EP 0306336 A2 describes a device for conducting an assay for 
the determination of an analyte in a sample, comprising a housing; means 
(e.g. an immunoabsorbing or potentially immunoabsorbing bibulous 
material) enclosed therein for capturing a first member of a specific 
binding pair in a zone and for allowing liquid to be transported by 
capillary action away from the zone; a first means in the housing for 
introducing the sample into the device; and second means in the housing 
for introducing liquid reagent other than the sample into the device 
without also introducing the liquid reagent through the first means.
