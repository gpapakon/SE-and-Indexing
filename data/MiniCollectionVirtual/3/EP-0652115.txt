<ABSTRACT>
A container for storing paint brushes and paint rollers comprises a body (1) of foamed material, which body is coated all-around in a sealing manner on all surfaces (11, 12, 13, 14). On the lid surface 12, it has an insertion opening (21) for inserting a paint brush (2) or a paint roller. The insertion opening (21) merges into a recess (22) inside the body (1) of foamed material. The recess corresponds approximately to the negative shape of a paint brush (2). The body of foamed material can easily be moistened with water or thinner, depending on the type of paint. An inserted paint brush (2) remains in a state immediately ready for use for a long time and does not have to be washed out each time. The body (1) of foamed material which is sealed off on all sides requires only little liquid and also prevents any leakages therefrom in the event of the container being tipped over.
