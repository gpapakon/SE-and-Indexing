<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a group of new 1-[2H-1-benzopyran-2-one-8-yl]-piperazine 

derivatives having interesting pharmacological properties due to 5-HT
1A
 agonism and 
5-HT
1D
-antagonism. 
The compounds have the general formula (1) 

wherein 

R₁ is alkyl (1-4C), alkoxy (1-4C), hydroxy, alkoxy(1-4C)alkyl(1-4C), pyrrolidinyl, 
piperidinyl, morpholinyl, halogen, cyano, trifluoromethyl, amino, or mono- or 

disubstituted amino wherein the substituents are alkyl (1-4C), or alkyl(1-4C)carbonyl, 
m has the value 0, 1 or 2, 
R₂ is alkyl (1-4C), alkoxy (1-4C), halogen or trifluoromethyl, 
n is 0 or 1, on the understanding that m + n is at least 1, 
R₃ is hydrogen, alkyl (1-3C) or alkenyl (2-3C), 
R₄ is alkyl (1-4C), and 
p has the value 0, 1 or 2, and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts 
thereof. 
The compounds can be used for the treatment of affections or diseases of the 
central nervous system caused by disturbances of the serotonergic transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a group of new 1-[2H-1-benzopyran-2-one-8-yl]-piperazine 
derivatives having interesting pharmacological properties. It has been shown in compounds of the hetero(bicyclic)arylpiperazine class which are 
clinically effective antidepressants and anxiolytics, such as for example buspirone, 
that their affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor is related to their pharmacological and 
clinical activity. Surprisingly it has now been found that a new group of 1-[2H-1-benzopyran-2-one-8-yl]-piperazine 
dervatives of the formula (1) 
wherein 
R₁ is alkyl (1-4C), alkoxy (1-4C), hydroxy, alkoxy(1-4C)alkyl(1-4C), pyrrolidinyl, 
piperidinyl, morpholinyl, halogen, cyano, trifluoromethyl, amino, or mono- or 
disubstituted amino wherein the substituents are alkyl (1-4C), or alkyl(1-4C)carbonyl, m has the value 0, 1 or 2, R₂ is alkyl (1-4C), alkoxy (1-4C), halogen or trifluoromethyl, n is 0 or 1, on the understanding that m + n is at least 1, R₃ is hydrogen, alkyl (1-3C) or alkenyl (2-3C), R₄ is alkyl (1-4C), and p has the value 0,1 or 2,  
and pharmaceutically acceptable acids addition salts thereof act on the central  
 
nervous system by binding to 5-HT receptors. The alkyl and alkoxy groups represented 
by R₁ to R₄ can be straight or branched. More particularly it has been found that these compounds bind to subtypes of the 5-HT 
receptor i.e. 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D subtype receptors. Furthermore, the compounds 
of the invention bind to these receptors in greater extent than they bind to other 
receptors of the 5-HT-type and other central nervous receptors, such as dopaminergic 
and adrenergic receptors. Known clinical effective antidepressants and anxiolytics belonging to the hetero(bicyclic)arylpiperazine 
class which bind to the 5-HT1A receptor all have a structural 
similarity with respect to the substituents present on the aliphatic amino group. It is 
well established that their affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor is predominantly caused by 
the interaction of these substituents with the 5-HT1A receptor. Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds of the invention have an 
extremely high affinity (even in the subnanomolar range) for the 5-HT1A receptor 
although they are not substituted at the aliphatic nitrogen atom. In spite of this, the 
compounds of the invention act as strong 5-HT1A agonists in functional models. For this reason it is very surprisingly that compounds as defined above have an 
extremely high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor although no large substituent is 
present on
