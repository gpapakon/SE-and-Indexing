Device for actuating a system such as a clutch or 
a gearbox associated with an engine, particularly a motor 

vehicle engine, and comprising control means (26-31) and 
an actuation member (38), and further comprising: 


a first shaft (4) rotationally driven by the 
engine; 
a second shaft (6) integral with the actuation 
member; 
coupling means (10, 13, 13, 16, 33) for 
coupling the second shaft to the first shaft under the 

action of the control means; 
means (48, 53) for uncoupling the second shaft 
from the first shaft after the second shaft has rotated 

through a predetermined angle; and 
return means (35) for returning the second 
shaft to its initial position after it has been uncoupled 

from the first shaft; 
 
characterised in that it comprises means (48, 53) for 

keeping the said coupling means coupled for as long as 
the second shaft has not rotated through the said 

predetermined angle. 
Device according to Claim 1, in which the holding 
means comprise a cam (53) and a cam follower (48), the 

rotation of the second shaft giving rise, by interaction 
of the cam and of the cam follower, in a first instance, 

to the second shaft being coupled to the first shaft and 
their being kept coupled, then, in a second instance, 

after the said rotation through a predetermined angle, 
their uncoupling. 
Device according to either one of Claims 1 and 2, 
in which the uncoupling means comprise two uncoupling 

members (47, 52), one of the uncoupling members (52) 
comprising a cam (53) and the other uncoupling member 

(47) carrying a cam follower (48) able to move over the 
cam, and one of the uncoupling members (52) being integral 

with a casing (1) of the device and the other 
uncoupling member (47) being arranged so as to be  

 
displaced in a first direction by a rotational movement 

of the second shaft, the displacement of this member in 
the first direction giving rise, by interaction of the 

cam follower and of the cam, to its displacement in a 
second direction, which gives rise to the uncoupling of 

the second shaft from the first shaft. 
Device according to either one of Claims 2 and 3, 
in which the cam is a groove and the cam follower is a 

finger engaged in the said groove. 
Device according to any one of Claims 2 to 4, in 
which the two friction members are coaxial with the first 

shaft, the first friction member being rotationally 
integral with the first shaft and the second friction 

member being rotationally integral with a support member 
(10) itself rotationally integral with a cogged gear (16) 

meshing with a toothed sector (33) rotationally integral 
with the second shaft, and in which the uncoupling member 

(47) which is not integral with the casing is integral, 
in axial translation, with the support member (10). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
comprising inhibition means (19, 42-46) for inhibiting 

the return means for as long as the rotational speed of 
the first shaft is lower than a predetermined threshold. 
Device according to Claim 6, in which the coupling 
means comprise a friction clutch comprising at 

least two friction members (13, 15) one (15) of which is 
arranged to be driven by the first shaft and the other 

(13) is capable of driving the second shaft, and in which 
the inhibition means comprise pressure means (19) for 

keeping the friction members under pressure, and at least 
one flyweight (46) for pushing the pressure means back 

when the rotational speed of the first shaft exceeds the 
predetermined threshold. 
Device according to Claim 7, in which the holding 
means comprise a cam (43) arranged to interact with a cam 

follower finger (42) integral with one of the friction 
members, the cam being stressed by elastic means (39) in 

the direction of keeping the friction members in contact,  
 

and the flyweights acting on the cam against the action 
of the elastic means. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, in 
which the control means comprise elastic means (72) 

arranged to control the device when they are released by 
the user, and to be reset by the device during its 

operational cycle.
