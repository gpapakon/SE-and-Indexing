<ABSTRACT>
Acetonitrile is purified by treatment with ozone. After ozone treatment is ended, acetonitrile is passed through packed columns of molecular sieve, activated alumina and charcoal or graphitized carbon; the process results in virtually pure acetonitrile obtained at an efficiency unachievable by prior art processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
purification of chemicals and in particular to the 
improved purification of acetonitrile. According to this 
improved process, acetonitrile is purified without using 
expensive equipment or corrosive chemicals such as amines 
with substantially no waste of the desired product, 
except the impurities. Prior art methods for the 
purification of acetonitrile involve at least one stage 
of distillation. A distillation stage is both costly and 
inefficient and the overall waste product is about 25% of 
the starting material. Using the present invention, 
acetonitrile purification is accomplished at great 
product savings, more efficiently; and, moreover, without 
the use of a distillation stage(s). Acetonitrile must be of an exceptionally high 
purity for use in UV spectrophotometry, electroanalytical 
studies, lithium-sulfur batteries, high performance 
liquid chromatography and DNA synthesis. In particular, 
acetonitrile must be exceptionally pure for these uses 
with regard to UV absorbing materials and water. Prior 
art methods of purifying acetonitrile have been 
unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons. One reason is 
that the methods generally involve at least one stage of 
distillation. A distillation stage is both costly in 
capital and operating costs and inefficient due to high 
losses e.g. in the bottoms of the stills if usual 
oxidation methods are used. The process of purification 
of the present invention does not use a single 
distillation stage yet achieves exceptional purity of low 
water content in the product, great capital savings at 
substantially no impact on environment because of 
substantially no wastes, and at great energy savings. There are many other disadvantages of the prior 
art methods which are overcome by the present invention. 
For example, the process of the present invention does  
 
not use corrosive chemicals such as amines or 
environmentally detrimental compounds such as 
permanganates, and the purity of the acetonitrile which 
is achieved is somewhat higher according to the process 
of this invention than with any prior art methods known 
to the inventors. The product is substantially impurity 
"finger print" free and is achieved without the 
raising costs (and effort) associated with 
the prior art required to achieve asymptotically the same purity level. One source of acetonitrile is from the 
production of acrylonitrile by gas phase oxidation of 
propylene and ammonia with oxygen. Acetonitrile is a by-product 
of the
