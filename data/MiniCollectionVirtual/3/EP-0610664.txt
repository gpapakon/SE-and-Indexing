<ABSTRACT>
The nursing lift and support device (1) comprises a support column (2) with a support arm (3) on which a holding member (7) is arranged. Its height can be adjusted via a support means (4). The support column (2) is releasably fastened by a holder (9) on a counter-holder which is preferably stationary. The device can be simply transported to the desired place and can be securely fixed there. For example, the support column (2) can be simply fastened by the support arm (3) via the holder (9) on the wall (10) or the rear wall of a bed. Moreover, the holder (9) needs little space, so that it causes little interference on fastening and the device (1) can therefore be brought up close to or mounted on a bed or the like.
