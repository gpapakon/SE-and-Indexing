<ABSTRACT>
A table, in particular an office table, having a tabletop (2) and at least one support (4, 12) for supporting the tabletop (2) is proposed. The table has at least one leg (7) and a foot (8) and is adjustable in height. The supports (4, 12) supporting the tabletop (2) have bearing surfaces (3, 13) which are substantially parallel to the tabletop (2) and are adjoined, at an angle, by an inclined bar (5) which leads into the leg (7) from the side and/or from the top depending on the height adjustment. Adjoining the inclined bar (5) is a downwardly extending connecting-link profile (6) which on its outside has height markings (63). In addition, the connecting-link profile (6) has a manually releasable catch mechanism (46) capable of locking into associated catch points of a connecting-link guide (16) of the leg (7).

parallel to the table top (2), 
f) wherein adjoining the supporting surfaces, at an angle to same, an inclined bar (5) 
extends which, depending on the height adjustment, extends into the leg (7) from 

the side and/or from the top, 
g) wherein the inclined bar is followed by a downwardly extending sliding block 

profile (6), 
 
characterized in that 


h) the sliding block profile is provided with height markings (63) on its outside, 
i) the sliding block profile comprises a manually releasable locking device (46) 
which can lock into associated locking points of a sliding block profile guide (16) 

of the leg (7), 
j) wherein the locking device (46) comprises a locking bar (48) which is arranged 
inside the sliding block profile and is tiltable against a biased spring (56) around 

an axle (47) which lies transversely to a longitudinal axis of the leg. 
Table according to claim 1, characterized in that the locking bar (48) is provided with 
a push-button and with a latch (49). 
Table according to claim 2, characterized in that by actuating the push-button the latch 
(49) can be moved out of and locked into locking points in the form of bores (58). 
Table according to claim 3, characterized in that a securing device is arranged in the 
sliding block profile (6) in the area of the locking device (46).
