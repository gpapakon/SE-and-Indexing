<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic pilot type selector valve is disclosed, which can serve 
as a double-solenoid type selector valve or a single-solenoid type selector 

valve by merely increasing or decreasing the number of solenoid mechanisms 
and by providing a few component parts. This selector valve comprises large 

(15a) and small pistons (15b) having different pressure receiving areas for 
driving main valve disc (11), and when two solenoid mechanisms (20a, 20b) are 

mounted, the main valve disc is switched over by pilot fluid pressure 
alternately applied on the two pistons, and when one solenoid mechanism is 

mounted, the main valve disc is switched over by switching pilot fluid 
pressure applied on the large size piston, while main valve disc is 

constantly pushed in one direction by pilot fluid pressure applied on the 
small size piston.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic pilot type selector valve to operate a main valve unit by an electromagnetically operated pilot valve unit.It is widely known in the art that the electromagnetic pilot type selector valve of this type is divided to a single-solenoid type selector valve having a pilot valve unit provided with a single solenoid mechanism and a double-solenoid type selector valve having two solenoid mechanisms.In general, the double-solenoid type selector valve comprises a main valve unit having a spool type main valve disc to switch over main fluid, and a pilot valve unit provided with two solenoid mechanisms for switching pilot fluid. By actuating these solenoid mechanisms alternately, pilot fluid is switched over, and by alternately applying pilot fluid pressure on pistons on both ends in axial direction of the main valve disc, main valve disc is switched over.The single-solenoid type selector valve comprises a main valve unit having a spool type main valve disc for switching main fluid, and a pilot valve unit provided with a solenoid mechanism for switching pilot fluid. The main valve disc is pushed permanently in one direction at one end in axial direction by force of a spring or by pilot fluid pressure, and by turning on or off the solenoid mechanism to apply or release pilot fluid pressure to the piston on the other end of the main valve disc, the main valve disc is switched over.The double-solenoid type selector valve and the single-solenoid type selector valve are generally constituted by special-purpose components, and it is practically impossible to use the components in common for these two types of valves except a few parts.However, it is desirable to use common components for these two types of valves. For example, if it is designed in such manner that a double-solenoid type selector valve is produced by assembling two solenoid mechanisms on a valve body assembly and that a single-solenoid type selector valve is produced by assembling a solenoid mechanism on the same valve body assembly, it will be very convenient for manufacture, parts control and maintenance as well as for repair when in trouble or change of models of the electromagnetic valve. Further, it will be possible to reduce the costs.An example of a conventional solenoid pilot operated valve is disclosed in GB 1526630 which discloses a valve having an input port, output ports and discharge ports in which the communication between these ports is switched by a spool type main valve. The main valve
