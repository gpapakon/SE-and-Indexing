<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ball valve assembly. A ball valve assembly typically has a ball supported in a valve body. 
The ball has a port, which in the open position of the valve, communicates 
with an inlet and an outlet in the body. At one position a drive shaft extends 
through the valve body and drivably connects the ball to a valve actuator. 
Rotation of the shaft by the actuator causes rotation of the ball through a 
predetermined angle of e.g. 90Â° between open and closed positions. In order to determine or monitor the position of the ball it is known to 
provide a sensor with an indicator associated with the actuator. However, 
sometimes because of wear, damage or other causes, the position of the ball 
is not accurately sensed or indicated. Further even though the ball may be 
in the closed position, leakage may occur, again due to wear, damage or 
other causes. EP-A- 0 063 010 discloses a ball valve assembly comprising a valve 
body having a passageway therethrough for flow of medium, a ball rotatably 
mounted within the body, adapted to block said passageway in a closed 
condition of the valve, and having a port adapted to be in communication 
with said passageway in an open condition of the valve, further comprising 
a signal emitter connected to or associated with the valve body, and capable 
of emitting a (radioactive) signal which will pass through the port when the 
ball is in one of the open and closed positions, but will be reflected from the 
ball when the ball is in the other of the open and closed positions, and a 
signal receiver provided to receive the signal after passing through the port. The assembly according to Claim 1 differs from that disclosed in EP-A-0 
063 010 in that the receiver is an ultra sound receiver which may detect 
an ultrasonic signal from within the valve. The assembly according to Claim 
4 differs from that disclosed in EP-A-0 063 010 in addition to the 
aforementioned features in the sense that the emitter is an ultra sound 
emitter and in that the receiver may also receive the signal having been 
reflected from the ball. Both arrangements of the invention allow not only the exact  
 
determination of the position of the ball but also the detection of a leakage 
although the valve is effectively in its closed position. The assembly disclosed 
in EP-A-0 063 010 deals only with the first aspect, i.e. the accurate 
determination of the position of the ball, but is completely silent on any 
possibility for detecting leakage e.g. through the closed ball valve.
