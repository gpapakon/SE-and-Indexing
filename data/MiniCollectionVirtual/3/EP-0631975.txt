<ABSTRACT>
An attachment, in particular for lift trucks, has a lifting frame (1) with at least two guide spindles (3, 4) running in parallel and side cheeks (2) connecting these guide spindles (3, 4). At least two displaceable supporting beams (5, 6) are provided on the guide spindles (3, 4) parallel to the side cheeks (2). Each of the supporting beams (5, 6) has at least two supporting spindles (7, 7', 8, 8') which run parallel to the guide spindles (3, 4). Sitting in turn on the supporting spindles (7, 7', 8, 8') are supporting elements (9, 9') which are mounted in such a way as to be displaceable relative to the supporting spindles (7, 7', 8, 8') and in particular are designed as pulling, clamping or gripping elements or can be connected to such.

<CLAIMS>
Attachment, in particular for lift-trucks, including

a lifting frame (1) having at least two, substantially
horizontally extending and mutually vertically spaced, parallel

guide shafts (3, 4) which are connected together by
substantially vertical side cheeks (2),
at least two support beams (5, 6) which are mounted on the
guide shafts (3, 4) and displaceable along the guide shafts (3,

4),
at least two support shafts (8, 8') which are vertically
spaced on the support beam (5) and extend in parallel with the

guide shafts (3, 4),
at least two further support shafts (7, 7') which are
vertically spaced on the other support beam (6) and extend in

parallel with the guide shafts (3, 4),
wherein the mutually corresponding support shafts (7, 8 and
7', 8') of the two support beams (5, 6) are arranged coaxially,

and
also including support elements (9, 9') which are mounted on
the support shafts (7, 7', 8, 8') in displaceable manner, and

are in the form, in particular, of lifting, clamping or claw
elements or are connectable to such-like elements.
Attachment in accordance with Claim 1,

characterised in that the support shafts (7, 7', 8, 8') are
rigidly connected to the support beams (5, 6).
Attachment in accordance with Claim 1,

characterised in that the support shafts (7, 7', 8, 8') are
mounted in floating manner in the support beams (5, 6). 
Attachment in accordance with any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the support beams (5, 6) are also in the

form of lifting, clamping or claw elements or are connectable
to such-like elements.
Attachment in accordance with any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the support shafts (7, 7', 8, 8') have

stops located outside the outer surfaces of the support
elements (9, 9').
Attachment in accordance with any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the support elements (9, 9') are

connected via a piston-cylinder arrangement to the opposite
side cheeks (2, 2') at the side remote from the respective

support element.
Attachment in accordance with any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the support beams (5, 6) are connected

together and biased towards one another by means of a
constraining device (11), in particular, a tension spring.
Attachment in accordance with any of the Claims 3 to 7,
characterised in that the support shaft (3 [sic]
, 4 [sic])

mounted in floating manner in the support beam (5, 6) is biased
by means of a spring arrangement.
