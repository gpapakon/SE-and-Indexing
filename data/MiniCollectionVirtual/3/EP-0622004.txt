<ABSTRACT>
An optical code recognition unit (OCRU) for recognising a predetermined n-bit optical code has an n-way splitter (7) having an input and n parallel outputs (7a). A plurality of cominbers (8a, 8b, 8c) are associated with the splitter outputs (7a), and a respective gate (9a, 9b, 9c) is controlled by the output of each of the combiners. Each of the splitter outputs (7a) is subject to a different delay of from 0 to (n-1) bit periods, and each combiner (8a, 8b, 8c) receives an input from at least one of the splitter outputs (7a). The OCRU is such that all the gates (9a, 9b, 9c) are turned on if a predetermined optical code is applied to the splitter input.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical processing in networks
carrying packetised signals, and in particular to an all-optical
code recognition unit for such a network.Optical fibre communication offers many advantages over
conventional wire based systems, these advantages including
reduced losses, increased bandwidth, immunity from
electromagnetic interference (EMI), and a high level of
security. The application of optical fibre technology into
the local area network (LAN) is, therefore, of increasing
interest. In the past, however, it has been assumed that
optical networks will only penetrate small business and
residential sectors if new broadband services are provided to
offset the additional costs involved in the installation of
the optical technology. Some of the broadband services that
could be provided are alpha-numeric videotex (e.g. Prestel),
photographic videotex, high definition television, interactive
video on demand (video library), video telephony, interactive
graphics and high-speed data services.Although the importance of providing such services has
been recognised for some time, it is difficult for
telecommunications operating companies to predict their market
potential and therefore justify a major investment. What is
required is an entry strategy that allows optical technology
to be installed economically for telephony and low-speed data
services, while maintaining the potential for evolution at a
marginal cost for future broadband services.In known optical networks, routing of information is
achieved at each node by electronic means, that is to say by
detecting the received optical signal to give an electrical
signal (plus detector noise). This electrical signal must be
regenerated, after processing and switching to remove the
noise, before the signal is re-transmitted optically.
Regeneration is bit-rate dependent, and so restricts the
information type that can be carried, thereby preventing the
transmission of broadband services. The need for regeneration
could be removed by coupling off, at each node, part of the 
received optical signal, the coupled-off signal being
converted to an electronic signal which is electronically
processed, the remaining uncoupled optical signal being rerouted
by the electronic processor. Unfortunately, the
electronic processing times severely limit the possible
capacity of the optical links, so again the provision of
broadband services is not practical. Thus, although the
electronic processor can switch quickly (of the order of
nanoseconds) it requires a
