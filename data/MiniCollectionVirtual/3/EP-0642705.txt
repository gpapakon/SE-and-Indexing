<ABSTRACT>
The coupler comprises two rotary elements (20, 21, 22 and 28), one of said elements (20, 21, 22) surrounding the other (28), an exciting coil (27) having a d.c. supply and surrounding the axis of rotation so that one of said elements (20, 21, 22) forms a main magnetic circuit, and means (37 to 40) for providing a d.c. supply to this coil (27). The element (20, 21, 22) constituting the main circuit has an inner part (22) and an outer part (21) surrounding the inner part (22), a gap (24) being formed between the two parts. The other element (28) has an intermediate part (28) housed in this gap (24), thereby forming two air gaps (42). The inner surface of the outer part (21) and the outer surface of the inner part (22) comprise irregularities, and consequently air gaps (42) also have at least one irregularity. The axially positioned conductive bars (31 and 32) are mounted on the intermediate part (28) and connected at their ends.

Inductive coupler comprising two rotating elements 
(20, 21, 22 and 27) around a common axis of rotation, 

one of the elements (20, 21, 22) at least partially 
surrounding the other (28), an exciting coil (36) 

supplied with continuous current and surrounding the 
axis of rotation in such way that one of the 

above-mentioned elements (20, 21, 22) forms a main 
magnetic circuit and supply means of continuous current

part (22) and an outer part (21) surrounding at a 
certain distance the inner part (22) and creating a 

space (24) between these parts, the other element (27) 
comprising an intermediate part (28) situated in this 

space (24), two clearances (42) being formed, namely ar 
inner clearance (42) between the above-mentioned inner 

part (22) and the intermediate part (28) and an outer 
clearance (42) between said intermediate part (28) anc 

the aforementioned outer part (21), whereby the inner

rotation, characterized in that each of the poles (25 
and 26) is provided with a denture comprising at least 

two teeth and in that the intermediate part (28) is
