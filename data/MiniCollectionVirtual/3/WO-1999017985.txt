<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adjustable propeller unit (20) for aircraft, land vehicles and watercraft which can be hydraulically reversed. Said adjustable propeller unit comprises a propeller with at least two blades, whose blade angle can be regulated by a control unit (regulator). A hydraulic connection exists between the rotating propeller and the stationary control unit for the blade drive. Said hydraulic connection has a spring loaded piston (4) which can be actuated by means of hydraulic fluid and adjustable mechanical stop motion devices for the start position (6), the brake position (8) and the travel or sailing position (5). The piston (4) is constructed as a spring loaded double piston comprised of an inner piston (19) and a ring piston (21) arranged around said inner piston. Both pistons can be locked with one another by means of a centrifugal force locking mechanism (22). In order to prevent uncontrolled reversing with revolutions above 1,500 RPM, the stop motion device (6) for the start position is constructed in order to limit the setting range of the locked double piston (4). The brake position can be obtained only when the inner piston is unlocked and the propeller revolutions are below 1,500 RPM when the propeller regulator is located in a high-pressure area.
