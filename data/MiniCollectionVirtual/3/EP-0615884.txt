<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved 
safety switch for power windows, specifically designed 

for application to motor vehicles and the like, 
characterized in that it comprises a base body (2), 

which, on the top thereof, supports a swinging push-button (3) 
pivoted about a central axis. 
The switch is provided with a template (9) or 
covering element, so assembled as to protect the 

push-button portion driving the raising movement of 
the motor vehicle glass windows.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
safety switch for power windows, which has been specifically 
designed for application to motor vehicles 
and the like. As is known, the power window switches which 
are at present mounted on motor vehicles and the 
like, usually comprise a push-button, projecting 
from an arm element arranged on the inner surface 
of each door which push-button, as it is pressed, 
causes the windows of the motor vehicle to be moved 
upwardly or downwardly. This push-button, however, because of its 
position, can be accidentally pressed by a person 
in the motor vehicle compartment, thereby accidentally 
operating the windows. This may be very dangerous, mainly if in 
the compartment of the motor vehicle there are present 
small children. The document DE-A-4 012 399 discloses a switch having substantially 
the features of the preamble of the main Claim, this switch being 
substantially of the blade type and does not provide means for 
preventing the switch from being accidentally operated.  
 Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above disclosed drawback, 
by providing an improved safety switch for power 
windows, specifically designed for application on  
 
motor vehicles and the like, which prevents the persons 
present in the compartment of the motor vehicle 
from accidentally operating the windows. Within the scope of the above aim, a main 
object of the present invention is to provide such 
a power windows safety switch which is very reliable 
and safe in operation and which, moreover, can be 
easily made starting from easily available elements 
and materials and which, furthermore, is very competitive 
from a mere economic standpoint. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as 
well as yet other objects, which will become more 
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by an improved 
safety power window switch, specifically designed 
having the features of Claim 1. Further characteristics and advantages of 
the invention will become more apparent hereinafter  
 
from the following detailed disclosure of a preferred, 
though not exclusive, embodiment of an improved 
saftety switch for power windows, specifically designed 
for application on motor vehicles and the 
like, which is illustrated, by way of an indicative, 
but not limitative example, in the accompanying 
drawings, where: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view illustrating 
the power window safety switch according to the present 
invention; Figure
