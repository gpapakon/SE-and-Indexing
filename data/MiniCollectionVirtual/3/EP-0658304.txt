<ABSTRACT>
A filtration unit (10) for an aquarium tank comprises a biological 
filter chamber (11) which is cyclically exposed to air and water without 

the use of conventional syphon means. Alongside the chamber (11) is a U-tube 
arrangement (25) one branch (27) of which communicates at its upper end 

with the upper region of the chamber (11). Compressed air is continuously 
admitted to the chamber (11), e.g. by bubbling up beneath its open bottom 

end. When the water in chamber (11) drops to the level of the bend of the 
U-tube (25) air in chamber (11) expells remaining water from the U-tube and 

is able to evacuate chamber (11), enabling it to refill with water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved aquarium filter and more 
particularly to an improved biological filter for an aquarium and to a 
filtration unit which comprises said improved biological filter together 
with a mechanical filter. It is well known that the water in an aquarium needs filtration both 
to maintain clarity and purity. In addition to a filter capable of 
removing solids from the water a biological filter is desirable to maintain 
its purity, the latter comprising a particulate material such as gravel or 
sand on which living bacteria can grow. It is also known that to 
promote the life cycle of the bacteria it is desirable that the biological 
filter medium should be intermittently exposed to air. An object of the present invention is to provide a simple, economical, 
reliable manner in which intermittent exposure of a biological filter medium 
to air can be achieved. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is 
provided a biological filter for an aquarium comprising a biological filter 
chamber containing a biological filter medium, means for disposing the 
chamber in or alongside an aquarium tank so that the chamber is 
substantially below the water level of the tank, means for connecting the 
bottom region of the chamber to water in the tank, means for introducing air 
under pressure into the chamber, an outlet connection in the upper region of 
the chamber and U-tube means comprising two upright branches joined at 
their bottom ends at or above the level of the bottom of the chamber, one 
said branch communicating at its upper end with said outlet connection of 
the chamber and the upper end of the other branch being level with or above 
said outlet connection, the arrangement being such that in use of the filter 
air admitted to the chamber displaces water therein until the water level in 
the chamber reaches the bottom ends of the branches, whereupon residual 
water in the other branch is expelled to permit evacuation of air from the 
chamber through the U-tube means with consequent refilling of the chamber 
and of the branches of the U-tube means with water from the aquarium tank to 
recommence the cycle.  In a preferred construction the chamber is open at its bottom end and 
the air introduction means is an air outlet disposed below the chamber, the 
chamber is adapted for submersion in the water in an aquarium tank and the 
said air outlet is arranged also to provide an air lift in the region of 
the biological filter chamber. In this way the air supply

<CLAIMS>
A biological filter for an aquarium comprising a biological filter 
chamber (11) containing a biological filter medium, means (15) for disposing 

the chamber in or alongside an aquarium tank so that the chamber (11) is 
substantially below the water level (W) of the tank, means (19, 41, 42) for 

connecting the bottom region of the chamber (11) to water in the tank, means 

(22) for introducing air under pressure into the chamber (11) and an outlet 
connection (29) in the upper region of the chamber (11) characterised by 

the provision of U-tube means (25) comprising two upright branches (26,27) 
joined at their bottom ends (28) at or above the level of the bottom of the 

chamber (11), one said branch (26) communicating at its upper end with said 
outlet connection (29) of the chamber (11) and the upper end of the other 

branch (27) being level with or above said outlet connection (29), the 
arrangement being such that in use of the filter air admitted to the chamber 

(11) displaces water therein until the water level in the chamber reaches 
the bottom ends (28) of the branches, whereupon residual water in the other 

branch (27) is expelled to permit evacuation of air from the chamber (11) 
through the U-tube means (25) with consequent refilling of the chamber (11) 

and of the branches (26,27) of the U-tube means with water from the aquarium 
tank to recommence the cycle. 
A filter as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the chamber 
(11) is open at its bottom end and the air introduction means (22) is an air 

outlet disposed below the chamber (11). 
A filter as claimed in claim 2 and adapted for submersion in the water 
in an aquarium tank, characterised in that said air outlet (22) is arranged 

also to provide an air lift (17) in the region of the biological filter 
chamber (11). 
A filter as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that said air outlet 
is in the form of a horizontally-elongated, hollow member (22) having an 

array of perforations (23) in its upper surface, and in that means (21) is 
provided to vary the position of the hollow member (22) relative to the 

bottom of the chamber (11) to adjust the ratio of air passing either to the 
chamber (11) or to the air lift (17). 
A filter as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that said hollow 
member (22) is mounted eccentrically on the bottom of an upwardly extending 

hollow shaft (20), the shaft serving to conduct compressed air to the hollow 
member (22) and being rotatable to vary the position of the hollow member 

(22) relative to the bottom of the biological filter chamber (11). 
A filter as claimed in any one of claims 3 - 5 characterised in that 
it further comprises a mechanical filter (12) arranged so that in use the 

air lift (17) will draw aquarium tank water through the mechanical filter 
(12). 
A filter as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the mechanical 
filter comprises a chamber (12) filled with a mechanical filter medium, 

having openings to admit aquarium tank water in at least one vertical face 
and communicating at its bottom end with a lower compartment (19) of the 

filter which communicates also with the air lift (17) and with the bottom 
end of the biological filter chamber (11). 
A filter as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that it further 
comprises a condition monitor for the mechanical filter in the form of an 

upright channel which tapers upwardly, the upper end region of the channel 
having an opening to aquarium water which by-passes the mechanical filter 

medium and the channel communicating at its bottom end with the said lower 
compartment (19), and a buoyant element freely located in the channel and of 

smaller dimensions than at least the wider part of the channel, the 
arrangement being such that in use as the mechanical filter medium becomes 

blocked the flow of aquarium water through the channel will increase, 
thereby driving the buoyant element downward in the channel to provide a 

visible indication of the condition of the mechanical filter medium. 
A filter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that it further comprises a silencer chamber (13) located above the 

biological filter chamber (11), the silencer chamber (13) communicating with 
the upper end of the other branch (27) of the U-tube means (25) and having 

one or more restricted openings (31) at positions which in use will be below 
the water level (W) of the aquarium tank and having an air outlet (30) in 

its upper region which in use will be above the water level (W) of the 
aquarium tank, the arrangement being such that in use of the filter air 

 
evacuating the biological filter chamber (11) will displace water from the 

silencer chamber (13) , thereby reducing the flow rate of air escaping from 
the silencer chamber (13) to atmosphere. 
A filter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that said means for disposing the biological filter chamber (11) in an 

aquarium tank comprises one or more suction cups (15), the or each said cup

connection to water in an aquarium tank at spaced-apart positions, the water 

inlet (41) and outlet (42) means being controlled by respective one-way 
valves (43,44) to ensure that water flowing into the biological filter 

chamber (40) as air evacuates therefrom is not substantially the same water 
as was expelled from the biological filter chamber (40) during the previous 

cycle. 
A filter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims and 
characterised in that it comprises a plurality of biological filter chambers 

(11) each having an associated U-tube means (25) and in that the 
arrangement is such that the means for introducing air under pressure into a 

second said chamber (11) is constituted by the U-tube means (25) associated 
with a first said chamber (11), whereby a common means for introducing air 

under pressure into all of the said chambers (11) is provided by the said 
means associated with the said first chamber (11). 
A filter as claimed in any one of claims 1 - 5, or any one of claims 9 
- 12 as appendant to any one of claims 1 - 5, characterised in that it 

further comprises a mechanical filter (12) having associated therewith a 
water pump (51) arranged to displace aquarium water through the mechanical 

filter (12), the pump (51) having on its downstream side an outlet passage 
(53) in which a Venturi (55) is formed, an air inlet (56) opening to said 

outlet passage (53) in the region of the Venturi whereby air is entrained in 
water flowing in said passage (53), the arrangement being such that said 

 
entrained air is utilised as said means for introducing air under pressure 

into the biological filter chamber (11).
