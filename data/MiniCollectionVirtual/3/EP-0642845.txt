<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises: a reservoir (13) containing a 
vaporizable cleaning fluid, a processing vessel (2) having 

a sealed cover (3), a distillation column (20) for distillation 
of the cleaning fluid under a vacuum; a vacuum 

generating means (9) for providing a vacuum in the vessel 
(2) and the column (20), and connection means (40) for 

connecting the column (20) and the vessel (2). Application 
to apparatus operating in sequential cycles: cleaning, rinsing 

and drying without pollution e.g. escape of vapors in the environment. 
When low pressure has been attained into vessel (2), communication 

between vessel and column (20) is established via valves (41,32) and 
rapid transfer of vapor between (20) and (2) takes place, enhancing 

rinsing and drying of the parts. Opening the vent (42), atmospheric 
pressure is reestablished and vapors are transferred via vacuum pump 

(10) and conduit (12) to reservoir for recirculation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the industrial cleaning 
and in particular to apparatus adapted to clean workpieces 
and other industrial parts by successive dipping, spraying, 
and rinsing steps using a generally liquid cleaning fluid 
which may be inflammable or not. More particularly, the invention relates to industrial 
apparatus for cleaning mechanical, electronic or optical 
parts and is directed more particularly but not exclusively 
to apparatus of a type operating in sequential cycles in 
contrast to apparatus of a continuous operation type. In apparatus of the above type it has become known to dip 
the parts to be cleaned, by means of an appropriate basket, 
in a dipping vessel containing the cleaning liquid. Such a 
dipping operation may include a high pressure spraying step 
as well as a cleaning step by application of ultrasonic 
waves of for example about 40 KHz. For performing such a method it has also become known to 
include a rinsing step and then a drying step to be performed 
in an enclosure adapted to retain any evaporations 
which may develop in order to minimize or eliminate any 
discharge thereof into the ambient air. While such apparatus may be considered to achieve the desired 
object, they nevertheless require relatively long 
sequential phases, in particular for the rinsing and drying 
operation which results, among others, in substantial 
energy consumption for vaporizing the cleaning liquid and 
ensuring appropriate drying of the parts to be cleaned.  The present invention overcomes the above drawbacks by providing 
a unique apparatus for cleaning, rinsing, and drying, 
which apparatus includes a distillation column for 
distillation of the cleaning fluid under vacuum and a 
vessel connected to suctione means and adapted to be 
connected to the column by connection means such that in 
the sealed volume which it delimits a vapour atmosphere 
under a relative vacuum may develop, which allows for rapid 
rinsing and drying without any pollution of the environment. The proposal of the present invention is adapted to be used 
in existing machines or can be used to realize a new apparatus 
in the rinsing and drying vessel, which allows, if 
desired, to provide operations such as spraying and even 
dipping prior to the cleaning steps. The invention and additional features of the invention are 
defined in the claims. Various embodiments of the present invention will be explained 
in more detail with reference to the accompanying 
drawings wherein:

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning, rinsing and drying workpieces 
and other industrial parts, comprising: 

   a reservoir (13) containing a vaporizable cleaning 
fluid, 

   a processing vessel (2) having a sealed cover (3), 
   a distillation column (20) for distillation of the 

cleaning fluid under a vacuum; 
   a vacuum generating means (9) for providing a 

vacuum in the vessel (2) and the column (20), and 
   connection means (40) for connecting the column 

(20) and the vessel (2). 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein 
the cleaning fluid containing reservoir includes at least 

one dipping and spraying vessel (14) of a constant level 
type. 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the vacuum generating means (9) is connected via a 

refeeding line to the reservoir (13) and the column (20) 
receives the fluid by a feeding line (24) extending from 

the reservoir. 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 or claim 3, 
wherein the vacuum generating means (9) is common to the 

column and the vessel and includes a suction pump (10) 
having its suction side connected to the column and the 

vessel by a pair of branch lines (11,30) one of which at 
least includes a selector valve (18;32). 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 or claim 3 or 
claim 4, wherein said connection means (40) and said feed 

line (24) each are provided with an isolating valve (41, 
25). 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein 
said processing vessel (2) comprises: 

   internally at least one pressurized spray means 
(50) connected to the outlet of a pump (51) drawing the 

cleaning fluid from the reservoir (13) and 
   discharging means (52) provided with a closure 

valve (53) and connected to said reservoir (13). 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 or claim 6, 
wherein said vessel (2) is connected to said pump by a pair 

of circuits (54,56) provided with selectively controllable 
control valves (55,57), one of which is connected to the 

spray means (50) and the other one of which is connected to 
the bottom (8) of the vessel which is provided with a level 

detector (60).
