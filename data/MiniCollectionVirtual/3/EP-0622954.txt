<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a system in which a photoelectric 
sensor having a transparent electrode and a photoconductive 

layer formed on a transparent substrate in this order is 
opposed to a liquid crystal recording medium having a 

transparent electrode and a polymer dispersion type of liquid 
crystal layer formed on a transparent substrate in this 

order, and voltage is applied between both the electrodes for 
exposure to image-carrying light, so that the liquid crystals 

are oriented to record the information. In this system, the 
transmittance of the liquid crystal recording medium, the 

current flowing through the photoelectric sensor or liquid 
crystal recording medium, the conductivity of the unexposed 

portion of the photoelectric sensor, and the transmittance of 
the liquid crystal layer at a dark portion are measured, or 

the voltage applied on the liquid crystal recording medium is 
estimated by monitoring the current flowing through the 

liquid crystal recording medium, so that the applied voltage 
and the duration of the applied voltage can be controlled. 

Before recording the information, the optimal applied voltage 
and the optimal duration of the applied voltage can thus be 

preset to make it possible to obtain images of high quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and device for
recording information on an information recording medium
built up of a photoelectric sensor and a liquid crystal layer
at a preset optimum applied voltage.
So far, an arrangement wherein a polymer dispersion type
of liquid crystal recording medium - in which a liquid
crystal layer having liquid crystals dispersed and fixed in
resin is formed on an electrode - is located in opposition to
a photoelectric sensor having a photoconductive layer formed
on an electrode layer has been known so as to record images
by exposure to light at an applied voltage.A typical construction of an image recorder used with
such a polymer dispersion type of liquid crystal recording
medium is illustrated in FIG. 1, in which reference numerals
10 and 20 stand for a photoelectric sensor and a liquid
crystal recording medium, respectively. In the photoelectric
sensor 10 a transparent electrode 12 and a photoconductive
layer 13 are successively coated or otherwise formed on a
transparent supporting substrate 11, and in the liquid
crystal recording medium 20 a transparent electrode 22 and a
polymer dispersion type of liquid crystal layer 23 are
successively formed on a transparent supporting substrate 21.
The photoconductive layer 13 used, for instance, may have a
single-layer structure in which trinitrofluorenone is added
to amorphous selenium or amorphous silicon for an inorganic
photoconductive layer or to polyvinylcarbazole for an organic
photoconductive layer, a formed structure in which a carrier
generation layer obtained by dispersing an azo type pigment
in a resin such as polyvinyl butyral is formed on a carrier 
transport layer obtained by mixing a hydrazone derivative
with a resin such as polycarbonate, or other structures.An arrangement in which, as shown in FIG. 1, a
photoelectric sensor is opposed to a liquid crystal recording
medium for exposure to light at an applied voltage, while a
gap of about 10 Âµm is maintained between them by a spacer of
polyethylene, polyimide or other polymer, and an arrangement
in which, as shown in FIGS. 2(a) and 2(b), a photoelectric
sensor and a liquid crystal recording medium are stacked
together, have been put forward in the art. The stacked form
of recording medium is broken down into two types, one in
which a liquid crystal recording layer is stacked directly on
a photoelectric sensor, as shown in FIG. 2(a), and the other
in which an middle layer 24 of a transparent dielectric
material is interposed between them, as shown in FIG.
