<ABSTRACT>
For compensating the Early effect a band gap reference 
voltage source includes current mirror circuits (T₄, Q₃ and 

T₁, Q₂ as well as T₂, Q₁) to ensure that the currents 
necessary for achieving the temperature-compensated output 

voltage are generated. Using the current mirror circuits 
makes the reference voltage source independent of changes in 

the supply voltage (U
cc
) and enables it in particular to be 
employed at supply voltages as of 3 V.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a band gap reference voltage source
as defined in
the precharacterizing portion of claim 1.A band gap reference voltage source is disclosed by the
semiconductor circuitry text book "Halbleiter-Schaltungstechnik"
by U.Tietze and Ch. Schenk published by
Springer Verlag, 9th edition, pages 558 et seq. In this known
band gap reference voltage source the base-emitter voltage of
a bipolar transistor is employed as the voltage reference.
The temperature coefficient of this voltage of -2mV/K is
markedly high for the voltage value of 0.6 V. Compensating
this temperature coefficient is achieved by adding to it a
temperature coefficient of + 2mV/K produced by a second
transistor. It can be shown that by operating the two
transistors at differing current densities a highly accurate
reference voltage of 1.205 V can be achieved which exhibits
no dependency on temperature.This known band gap reference voltage source has the
disadvantage, however, that its temperature independence
applies only for a certain supply voltage. This is due to the
so-called Early effect which manifests itself by the
collector current being a function of the collector emitter
voltage of a transistor. When there is a change in the supply
voltage of the known band gap reference voltage source,
therefore, the current values in the individual branches of
the circuit change so that the current ratios necessary for 
achieving temperature compensation no longer apply. The
generated reference voltage is accordingly no longer
independent of the temperature.One way of solving this problem would be to generate the
currents needed by means of current mirrors, for which
proposals already exist, to more or less completely eliminate
the influence of the Early effect. Such compensated current
mirror circuits are disclosed for instance in the textbook on
integrated bipolar circuits "Integrierte Bipolarschaltungen"
by H.-M. Rein, R. Ranfft, published by Springer Verlag 1980,
pages 250 et seq. for bipolar transistors. For current
mirrors comprising field-effect transistors, circuits for
eliminating the Early effect - also termed lambda effect in
conjunction with literature on field-effect transistors - are
described in "CMOS Analog Circuit Design" by Phillip E. Allen
and Douglas R. Holberg, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc.
pages 237 et seq.One drawback of using compensated current mirrors to generate
the currents required in a band gap reference voltage source
is that it is no longer possible to operate such compensated
current mirrors
