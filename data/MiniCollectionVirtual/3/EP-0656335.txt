<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of a hydroxylic compound selected from alcohols
and diols by hydrogenation of a corresponding hydrogenatable
material selected from monoesters of carboxylic acids,
monoesters of dicarboxylic acids, diesters of dicarboxylic
acids, and mixtures of two or more thereof.It is known to produce alcohols by hydrogenation,
or more properly hydrogenolysis, of monoesters of carboxylic
acids. The reaction can be summarised as follows:-

In the book "Catalytic Hydrogenation" by M. Freifelder,
published by John Wiley and Sons Inc. (1978), it is stated
at page 129 et seq. that the catalyst of choice is barium
promoted copper chromite. In "Organic Reactions", Vol. 8,
published by John Wiley and Sons Inc. (1954), Chapter I is
by Homer Adkins and is entitled "Catalytic Hydrogenation of
Esters to Alcohols". It is suggested that a "copper
chromite" catalyst is more correctly described as an
approximately equimolar combination of cupric oxide and
cupric chromite, i.e. CuO,CuCr2O4. Reference may also be
had to Kirk-Othmer's "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology"
(Third Edition), Volume 1, page 733 to 739.Patent specifications describing hydrogenation of
esters to yield alcohols include US-A-2040944, US-A-2079414,
US-A-2091800, and FR-A-1276722.It is known to effect hydrogenation of certain
esters and diesters in the vapour phase. For example it has
been proposed to use a reduced copper oxide/zinc oxide
catalyst for effecting hydrogenation of esters in the vapour
phase. In this connection attention is directed to GB-B-2116552. 
Also of relevance is WO-A-90/8121.It is further known to produce diols, such as
butane-1,4-diol, by catalytic hydrogenation of esters of
dicarboxylic acids, such as a dimethyl or diethyl ester of
maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, or a mixture of
two or more thereof. Such processes are described, for
example, in GB-A-1454440, GB-A-1464263, DE-A-2719867, US-A-4032458,
and US-A-4172961.Production of butane-1,4-diol by vapour phase
hydrogenation of a diester, typically a dialkyl ester, of a
C4 dicarboxylic acid selected from maleic acid, fumaric
acid, succinic acid, and a mixture of two or more thereof
has been proposed. In such a process the diester is
conveniently a di-(C1 to C4 alkyl) ester, such as dimethyl
or diethyl maleate, fumarate, or succinate. A further
description of such a process can be found in US-A-4584419,
EP-A-0143634, WO-A-86/03189, WO-A-86/07358, and WO-A-88/00937.Another commercially important diol is
