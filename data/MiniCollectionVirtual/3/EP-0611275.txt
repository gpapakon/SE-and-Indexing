<ABSTRACT>
In a process for separating small workpieces from a workpiece/abrasive-body mixture, the workpiece/abrasive-body mixture in a container (2) is subjected to an upwardly directed fluid stream, the absolute flow rate of which lies between the sinking rate of the one mixture component and the sinking rate of the other mixture component. The heavier mixture components are collected at the bottom of the container (2), and the lighter mixture components are removed at the top. To carry out the process, there is inserted into a container (2) which is provided, in the bottom, with a supply pipe (5) of a pump (3) a strainer basket (7) which has a closed bottom (8) and into which there opens a nozzle (9) which is provided with a feed opening for the workpiece/abrasive-body mixture. A quick and reliable separation of the workpieces from the abrasive bodies is thereby achieved.

Method of separating small workpieces out of a 
workpiece abrasive mix, the mix being introduced 

into a fluid and the process of separation being 
carried out according to how the bodies rise and 

fall in the liquid,
 
characterised in that
 
the workpiece abrasive mix is exposed in a 

container to a flow of liquid, especially water, 
directed upwards, the absolute velocity of the 

flow of this liquid lying between the settling 
speed of one part of the mixture and the settling 

speed of the other part of the mixture, and the 
heavier parts of the mixture, especially 

workpieces, are collected on the base of the 
container whilst the lighter parts of the mixture, 

especially the abrasive bodies, are drawn upwards. 
Method according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the water is provided with additives which 

increase the viscosity or the density.  
 
Device with a container (2),
 
characterised in that
 
to carry out the process according to claim 1 or 

2, there is inserted into the container (2), which 
is provided in its base with an inlet pipe (5) 

from a pump (3), a strainer basket which has a 
closed base and into which a nozzle (9) 

discharges, which nozzle is provided with a feed 
aperture for the workpiece abrasive mix, and that 

the container (2) has an outlet channel (10) going 
round it like a collar, which channel takes the 

fluid mixed with the abrasive bodies to a 
collecting vessel (4). 
Device according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the collectin
g vessel (4) is designed as a 
strainer basket and is arranged in a housing (1) 

which also contains the pump (3) and the container 
(2). 
Device according to claim 3 or 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the pump (3) is designed to be adjustable.
