<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet recording paper sheet for ink-jet 
recording with on-demand type heads having a multi-nozzle 

comprises a recording layer formed on one face 
of a base paper sheet to give a basis weight of the 

recording paper of from 150 to 250 g/m² with a coating 
color which contains a pigment and a binder, the 

pigment containing synthetic silica having a BET 
specific surface area ranging from 250 to 500 m²/g at a 

content of not less than 80 % by weight of the pigment, 
the binder containing casein and styrene-butadiene 

rubber, the weight ratio of the pigment to the binder 
ranging from 1.8 to 2.4, the recording layer having 

coating solid in an amount ranging from 15 to 25 g/m², 
and surface roughness by ten-point-hight of the 

recording layer ranging from 0.5 to 5 µm, and the paper 
sheet being curled at a maximum curling height ranging 

from 0 to 20 mm in A4 paper size with the printed face 
upside. An ink-jet recording method ejects ink 

droplets by thermo energy from an on-demand type head 
having a plurality of nozzles onto the recording paper 

sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet recording paper
sheet according to claims 1 and 3, respectively. The present
invention further relates to an ink-jet recording method
according to claims 5 and 6, respectively, in which these ink-jet
recording paper sheets are used.The ink-jet recording system, which ejects an
ink (recording liquid) directly onto a recording paper
sheet, is attracting attention because of its low
operation cost and low noise generation.In recent years, in ink-jet recording, multi-nozzle
type recording apparatuses have come to be used
for full-color image recording by use of a plurality of
color inks at a high recording speed.For such a recording system, aqueous inks are
used in view of safety and printing characteristics of
the ink. The recording-paper therefor is required to
absorb the ink quickly; not to cause running of ink 
even when different colors of ink dots are overlapped;
to allow appropriate ink-dot spreading; to enable
formation of ink dots in a shape approximate to a true
circle with a sharp dot edge; and naturally to have
sufficient whiteness of the recording face in order to
obtain high density and high contrast of the dots.Hitherto, coated paper is used to satisfy the
above requirements. However, the coated paper sheet
sometimes cockles or wrinkles depending on the
environmental conditions.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 62-95285
discloses improved cast-coated paper to satisfy
the above requirements for the image formation and to
prevent the wrinkle formation.Such recording paper, however, involves various
problems when it is used for ink-jet recording with an
on-demand type ink-jet apparatus having a multi-nozzle
which applies a large amount of ink locally in a short
time. If ink absorbency of the recording face is made
lower to achieve higher optical density of the recorded
image, the applied ink is liable to bleed and
preferential absorption of the dyes in the inks is
liable to occur to cause color irregularity: for
example, black color printing with four color-inks of
yellow, cyan, magenta, and black may result in
irregular brown colored pattern on a black background
(a bronze phenomenon). If the recording layer is modified to absorb
the ink at the surface portion, the ink causes swelling
of the surface portion of the recording layer, whereby
fine roughness may be caused on the cast-coated surface
to lower the gloss at the printed area.If composition of a coating color for recording
layer formation is changed to raise the ink absorbency
of the
