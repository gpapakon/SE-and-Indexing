<ABSTRACT>
Air is purified by being passed in sequence through a first, lower, bed 4 
of activated alumina particles which adsorb water vapour preferentially 

therefrom, and a second, upper, bed 6 of zeolite 13X molecular sieve 
particles which adsorb carbon dioxide preferentially therefrom. The air 

passes upwardly through the first bed 4 and downwardly through the second 
bed 6. Once fully loaded with the adsorbed components, the beds 4 and 6 

are regenerated by the passage therethrough of hot regeneration gas. One 
part of the regeneration gas flows downwardly through the first bed 4; 

another part flows upwardly through the second bed 6. The hot 
regeneration gas causes the previously adsorbed components to be 

desorbed. Once regeneration has ended, and the beds have returned to 
their adsorbing temperature, they may be used again to purify air.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for purifying a gas
stream containing impurities comprising water vapour and carbon dioxide.Oxygen and nitrogen are primarily produced commercially by the
rectification of air. It is necessary to remove water vapour and carbon
dioxide from the air upstream of the rectification. In modern plants for
the separation of air by rectification this purification is accomplished
by adsorption. An incoming stream of compressed air is passed through a
first layer of adsorbent which preferentially adsorbs water vapour and a
second layer of adsorbent which preferentially adsorbs carbon dioxide.
Typically, while one pair of such layers is being used to purify incoming
air, another pair is being regenerated so as to enable there always to be
at least one pair of layers available for use in purifying the incoming
air.There is a tendency for air separation plant to be required to meet ever
increasing demands oxygen. As a result, the demands placed on the
preliminary adsorptive purification step are becoming ever greater.In practice, there tend for a number of reasons to be limitations on the
size of the vessels in which the adsorbent layers can be contained.
Accordingly, a large air separation plant typically producing at least
1000 tonnes per day of oxygen may require several adsorption vessels.
There is therefore a need to improve adsorption methods so as to enable
the productivity of the adsorption process per unit bed volume to be
increased.In a conventional adsorption process for purifying air in which the air
flows axially from bottom to top through a first layer of adsorbent
particles which preferentially adsorb water vapour and then through a
second layer of adsorbent particles which preferentially adsorb carbon
dioxide, excessive air velocities will fluidise the adsorbent layers.
There is therefore a limit on the air velocity and as a result a limit on
the rate at which air can be fed through an adsorbent vessel of a chosen
size.Once the adsorbent layers are fully loaded with adsorbed impurities, 
regeneration of the layers is conventionally performed by countercurrent
passage through the beds of a relatively hot regeneration gas. Since
carbon dioxide tends to be less strongly adsorbed than water vapour,
inefficiencies are introduced into the regeneration step as a result of
the regeneration gas not reaching the adsorbent layer charged with water
vapour until it has passed through the layer charged with carbon dioxide.
Accordingly, there is a waste of thermal regeneration

<CLAIMS>
A method of purifying a feed gas stream containing impurities comprising
water vapour and carbon dioxide, comprising repeating in sequence the

steps of:

a) passing the feed gas stream in sequence upwardly through a first
particulate bed comprising first adsorbent which preferentially adsorbs

water vapour therefrom and downwardly through a second particulate
bed comprising second adsorbent which preferentially adsorbs carbon

dioxide therefrom; and
b) passing a regeneration gas through both beds so as to regenerate the
beds by causing desorption of previously adsorbed water vapour and

carbon dioxide, wherein none of the regeneration gas which passes
through th
e second bed flows through the first bed, 
characterised in
that
 the direction of flow of the regeneration gas through both beds is
countercurrent to that of the flow of the feed gas.
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which the first bed has an average
particle size greater than that of the second bed.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in which no carbon dioxide or
less than 10% of the total carbon dioxide is adsorbed in the first bed.
A method as claimed in claim 3, in which adsorption of water vapour is
completed in the first bed.
A method as claimed in claim 4, in which separate streams of regeneration
gas are used to regenerate the first and second beds.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in which the feed
gas is air.
