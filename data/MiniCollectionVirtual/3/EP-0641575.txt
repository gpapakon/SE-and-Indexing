<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of forming the surface design of a ski, transparent surface material being printed on the rear side, and said surface material which has been printed on the rear side being applied onto a previously pressed basic ski. Alternatively, printed paper or a printed nonwoven may be laid, as an insert, between the transparent surface material and the previously pressed basic ski. Using this method, in particular a so-called prefabricated shell-type ski having a three-dimensional surface and side cheek contour may be fitted out with any surface design.
