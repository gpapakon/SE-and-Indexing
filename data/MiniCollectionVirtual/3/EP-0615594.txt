<DESCRIPTION>
 Pipe Retaining ElementThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus for use with underfloor pipes.Conventionally, underfloor pipes, such as water pipes are accommodated and loosely held in notches in the joists supporting the floorboards. These are cut into the joists, the pipes are laid in position and the floorboards are subsequently nailed down to the joists. Problems of support can arise as the edge or the whole of a floorboard running transverse to the joist may be positioned over a line of notches in the joist, leading to uneven support over the length of the floorboard. Any uneveness in the joists or support can result in raised or at least uneven floorboards, which, because they are rigid and do not distort easily to accommodate any underlying distortions, results in a non-level floor. Furthermore, depending on the abilities of the plumber the notch may be too large or too small for a particular pipe such that the pipe either rattles around in the notch or may be put under pressure by the sides of the notch if the pipe expands. These problems particularly arise with water or central heating pipes where trapped air can cause vibration of the pipes and passage of hot fluid can cause expansion of the pipes.According to the present invention there is provided a method of fitting underfloor pipes comprising cutting a notch in a joist, placing the pipe in the notch and retaining the pipe in the notch by means of a pipe retaining element, the pipe retaining element comprising a channel configured to retain loosely the pipe in place in the notch, means to fix or retain the element in the notch and a flat supporting surface, the depth of notch being chosen to match the height of the element such that the flat supporting surface is substantially level withSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 the top surface of the joist when fixed or retained in place.Use of a pipe retaining element as claimed above overcomes the problems of the prior art method of fitting pipes and enables full support to be given to the subsequently laid floorboards, as those that overlap the edges of the notch will be held up by the flat supporting surface of the pipe retaining element. This supporting surface is substantially level with the top surface of the joist in use and therefore level floorboards may be laid without any additional work being required to compensate for the notches in the joists or the presence of the pipe retaining elements therein. Furthermore, the element is dimensioned or shaped so as to fit snugly in the notch so

CLAIMS
1. A method of fitting underfloor pipes comprising cutting a notch in a joist, placing the pipe in the notch and retaining the pipe in the notch by means of a pipe retaining element, the pipe retaining element comprising a channel configured to retain loosely the pipe in place in the notch, a securing means to fix or retain the element in the notch and a flat supporting surface, the depth of notch being chosen to match the height of the element such that the flat supporting surface is substantially level with the top surface of the joist when fixed or retained in place.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 further comprising providing a pipe retaining element of a width chosen to match the width of the joist.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 , further comprising providing a pipe retaining element with an impenetrable flat supporting surface.
4. A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein the pipe element provided has a flat supporting surface formed of metal.
5. A method as claimed in any preceding claim comprising providing a pipe retaining element of a two- piece construction comprising an upper plate of impenetrable material and a lower body part.
6. A method as claimed in claim 5 comprising providing a two-piece retaining element having a moulded plastics body and a metal upper plate.
7. A method as claimed in any preceding claim comprising providing one or more removable inserts adapted to engage with the channel of the retaining 


 element to define a smaller inner channel, such that the element may be used with pipes of varying dimensions.
8. A method as claimed in any preceding claim comprising providing a pipe retaining element formed with a plurality of channels, and fitting the element around a plurality of pipes placed in the notch.
9. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the element is dimensioned so as to fit snugly within the notch whereby in use there is no interference with any floorboard-supporting surfaces of the adjacent joist.
10. A pipe retaining element for use with a method as claimed in any preceding claim which includes a channel configured to retain loosely a pipe of known dimensions, a securing means for fixing or retaining the element in a notch in a joist and an impenetrable flat supporting surface, the element being dimensioned such that the impenetrable flat supporting surface is substantially level with the top surface of the joist when fixed or retained in place, the element being thereby adapted to provide support and to shield a pipe in use.
11. A pipe retaining element as claimed in claim- 10 in which the upper supporting surface is formed of metal.
12. A pipe retaining element as claimed in claim 10 or 11 comprising a two-piece construction having an upper plate of impenetrable material and a lower body part.
13. A pipe retaining element as claimed in claim 12 comprising an upper plate of metal and a lower body part of moulded plastics. 


 14. A pipe retaining element as claimed in any of claims 10 to 13 further comprising one or more removable inserts adapted to engage the channel of the element to define a smaller inner channel .
15. A pipe retaining element as claimed in any of claims 10 to 14 comprising a plurality of channels adapted to engage a plurality of pipes in use.
16. A kit of parts comprising any combination of one or more pipe retaining elements as claimed in claim 10 and adapted to fit a single pipe, one or more pipe retaining elements adapted to fit a plurality of pipes as claimed in claim 15 and one or more inserts as claimed in claim 14.
17. A pipe retaining element or method substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to any of Figures 1 and 2, Figures 3 and 4 and Figure 5.
