<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a locking device (11) comprising a 
locking chain body (10) having a plurality of connecting members (12) 

pivotably connected to each other at adjacent end portion (13) 
thereof through a pivot connection, including a pivot shaft (15). 

At least two adjacent surfaces (14) of adjacent end portions (13) are 
elastically pressed against each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a locking device for locking vehicles such 
as motorcycles, bicycles etc., while parking, comprising a locking 
chain body having a plurality of connecting members pivotably 
connected to each other at adjacent end portions thereof through a 
pivot connection including a pivot shaft. Such locking devices have been disclosed in Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication Sho62-59783 or in US-4,760,718. Such a locking device is provided with a locking chain body having a 
plurality of rod members arranged in longitudinal succession and 
having opposite ends of two adjacent ones of the rod members piled 
on each other and connected with each other through a pivot shaft 
pivotally relative to each other, so that, when the locking chain 
body is formed like a loop by pivoting these rod members, both ends 
of the locking chain body may be connectable with each other. 
Further, this locking device is provided with a lock portion for 
locking both ends of the locking chain body as connected. When intending to prevent the parked vehicle from getting stolen, at 
least one end portion of the locking chain body above is made 
penetratable, for example, one wheel with one end thereof or 
midsection thereof held with hands. Then, this locking chain body 
is formed like a loop enclosing a fixed member of the vehicle, eg., 
the front fork of the motorcycle, or a fixed structure such as a 
utility pole, and both ends of the locking chain body are connected 
with each other and is locked with the lock portion in the connected 
state. Thus, the locking chain body is locked in a state with the 
vehicle wheel prevented from revolving, and the vehicle is prevented 
from getting stolen. Hereupon, when intending to make one end of the locking chain body 
penetrate the wheel, since this end is in a free state, the rod  
 
member at this end may be unexpectedly pivoted in an unintended 
direction by its own weight or by a shock caused by hitting against 
the wheel. If the end rod member is unexpectedly pivoted as described above, 
the penetrating operation above is hindered, and the operation for 
attaching the locking device on the object becomes troublesome. Accordingly it is an objective of the present invention to provide a 
locking device which can be handled more easily and attached to the 
object to be locked without difficulties. According to the present invention this objective is performed in 
that at least two adjacent surfaces of adjacent end portions are 
elastically pressed against each other.

<CLAIMS>
Locking device comprising a locking chain body (10) 
having a plurality of connecting members (12) pivotably 

connected to each other at adjacent end portions (13) 
thereof through a pivot connection including a pivot 

shaft (15), characterised in that at least two adjacent 
surfaces (14) of adjacent end portions (13) are 

elastically pressed against each other. 
Locking device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the connecting members are formed by rod members 

(12), which are piled on each other with adjacent end 
portions thereof. 
Locking device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the pivot shaft is formed by a bolt (15) fixedly 

connected to one of said adjacent end portions (13). 
Locking device as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that an elastic member (25) is 

disposed between said adjacent surfaces (14). 
Locking device as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that 
the elastic member (25) is 
generally C-shaped and is elastically and wedgewise 

pressed radially outwards by outer edge portions (14b) of 
both adjacent surfaces (14). 
Locking device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the elastic member (25) has a circular cross-section 

and is made of a spring material. 
Locking device as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
 

4, characterised in that the elastic member is an O-ring 
(25) surrounding the pivot shaft (15) and interposed 

between both adjacent surfaces (14). 
Locking device as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the elastic member is an O-ring 

(25) which is interposed between a head portion (21) of 
the pivot shaft (15) and an adjacent surface of the 

adjacent end portion (13). 
Locking device as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
8, characterised in that the pivot shaft (15) is formed 

by a bolt screwed into a screw hole (18) provided in one 
of said adjacent end portions (13) of the rod members 

(12) and has a shank portion (20) which is inserted in a 
through hole (17) of the other one of said adjacent end 

portions (13), said shank portion having a larger 
diameter than said screw hole (18) and a greater length 

than said through hole (17), thus limiting the pressure 
on the elastic member (25) between the mating surfaces 

(14).
