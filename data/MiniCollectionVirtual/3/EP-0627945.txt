<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention provides an apparatus for stretching muscles. The apparatus comprises a plurality of means for engaging a limb connected adjacent to one another. Preferably, the engaging means comprise loops or pockets (20). The apparatus is used by engaging a portion of a limb with one of the engaging means, and grasping and pulling engaging means on each side of the ''engaged'' engaging means in a direction opposite or the same as the direction the engaged limb is being moved. In this manner, stretching of muscles in the engaged limb is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention primarily relates to a
device used in exercising, and more particularly to
an apparatus for stretching muscles.The stretching out of muscles before exercise is
known today to help prevent muscle injury during
exercise. To a certain degree a person can stretch
his own muscles alone by bending and twisting.
However, certain muscles may be more thoroughly
stretched with the aid of another person. A second
person can apply extra force to the stretching
movements to further enhance the effects of
stretching. The need for a second person, however,
is a disadvantage in that a second person is not
always available when a person must stretch. A need
thus exists for an apparatus that allows a single
person to more thoroughly stretch their muscles,
without the need for a second person to assist them.U.S. Patent No. 5,004,228 discloses a stretching
apparatus used primarily for stretching the hamstring 
and lower back muscles. This stretching apparatus includes
two handgrip placement straps, both of which extend away
from a centrally located foot support strap. A plurality
of handgrips, i.e. wooded bead elements, are shaped to
fit within the palm of a user's hand, and are slidably
received by the two handgrip placement straps and affixed
at selected locations along the lengths of the handgrip
placement straps. U.S. Patent No. 5,004,228 also discloses
in the background thereof various stretching devices primarily
used for stretching the inner thigh muscles, such as a
cable-pulley system, and a hand cranking device.The above problems and the disadvantages of prior stretching
methods are overcome by the exercise strap of 
the subject invention. Accordingly, a principle
object of the present invention is to provide an
apparatus for stretching muscles.It is a further object of the invention to
provide such an apparatus which can be used by one
person without the aid of another person.The main components of the subject invention
include a plurality of means for engaging a limb.
These engaging means are connected adjacent to one
another and may comprise loops or pockets, for
example. The engaging means may be attached to a
cord in adjacent fashion. The apparatus for
stretching muscles is preferably made of inelastic
material such as nylon, or a net-like material.In its use, one of the engaging means is used to
engage a portion of a limb. Engaging means on each
side of the "engaged" engaging means are then grasped
as the engaged limb is moved in a direction. The
grasped engaging means are then pulled
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for stretching muscles, comprising:
an elongated member formed from a pliable, substantially

inelastic material, characterized in that

a plurality of openings is formed along said elongated
member,

wherein each of said plurality of openings includes
an inner surface for engaging a limb (40).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein each of said plurality
of openings is formed adjacent to at least

another one of said plurality of openings.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein each of said plurality
of openings comprises a loop (14).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein each of said plurality
of openings is defined by a pocket (12).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said plurality of
openings are equally spaced along said elongated member.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said plurality of
openings are equally sized.
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising stitching,
said stitching defining a portion of said inner surface

of each of said plurality of openings. 
A method of using an apparatus for stretching
muscles as in claim 1, comprising the steps of:


(a) engaging a portion of a limb with one of
said plurality of openings formed along said

elongated member,
(b) grasping openings of said plurality of openings
on both sides of said opening engaged by said

limb, and
(c) moving the engaged first limb in a first
direction.
The method of using an apparatus for stretching
muscles according to claim 8, further comprising:


(d) pulling the grasped openings in said first
direction, thereby enhancing stretching of

the muscles in said limb.
The method of using an apparatus for stretching
muscles according to claim 8, further comprising:


(d) pulling the grasped openings in a second
direction, said second direction being

opposite said first direction, thereby
enhancing stretching of muscles in said limb.
