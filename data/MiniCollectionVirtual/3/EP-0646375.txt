<ABSTRACT>
The use of peptides for manufacturing a composition 
for parenterally administering amino acids to a patient. 

The composition provides amino acids to the patient in 
the form of peptides. The structure of the peptides are 

chosen so as to provide a desired clearance of the amino 
acids from the blood. Preferably, the peptides are 

dipeptides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
parenteral infusion of compositions into a patient. More 
specifically the present invention relates to the 
infusion of amino acids into a patient. Of course, it is known in the medical arts to 
enterally and parenterally infuse compositions into a 
patient for a variety of reasons. Such compositions can 
include medicaments, as well as nutriments such as amino 
acids. The resultant blood level of any composition that 
is infused, ingested, or injected into a patient, is a 
function of: its infusion rate; its rate of clearance 
(CL) from the vascular compartments; its rate of entry 
into a vascular compartment; and its rate of endogenous 
generation. When administering compositions, achieving 
a given blood level may be critical for the given 
therapeutic application. One can modify the blood level 
of the composition that is infused by either altering the 
infusion rate or the concentration of the composition. Amino acids are, of course, an essential component 
of the nutritional requirements of a patient. For many 
medical conditions, it may be necessary to parenterally 
provide amino acids to a patient. Although numerous 
compositions are commercially available that contain 
amino acids, for at least certain applications 
traditional amino acid solutions may not function 
entirely satisfactorily. Current intravenous nutrition (IVN) with amino acids 
may be limited in its ability to provide at least  
 
tyrosine, cysteine and glutamine as free amino acids, 
which may be essential for patients requiring intravenous 
nutrition. Thus interest has been raised in utilizing 
the dipeptide forms of at least some amino acids as 
substrates. Dipeptides provide methods for providing amino acids 
that have been difficult to administer in their free 
amino acid form. See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,122,515 and 
5,189,016. In the blood stream, the peptides are 
hydrolysed into their constituent amino acids. These 
amino acids are then taken up and utilized by the tissue 
of the patient. The dipeptide forms of, for example, tyrosine, 
glutamine, and cysteine are generally more stable and 
soluble than the free forms. This characteristic of 
peptides may facilitate the parenteral infusion of the 
constituent amino acids into a patient. Greater 
solubility allows more concentrated solutions to be 
administered to a patient, which reduces fluid input. Dipeptides would favor peripheral vein intravenous 
nutrition infusion because they allow the infusion of 
twice as much amino

Use of peptides of selected structures for the preparation of a composition 
for providing selected levels of amino acids in the blood of a patient, the peptides 

providing the desired amino acids to the patient and the structure of the peptides 
being chosen so as to provide a desired clearance of the amino acids from the 

blood. 
Use of peptides of selected structures for the preparation of a composition 
for parenteral administration for providing amino acids, that may be toxic if 

present at too great a blood concentration, at a blood concentration below toxic 
levels, the peptides having a structure that provides for a sufficiently rapid 

clearance of the amino acids from the patient's blood stream. 
Use of peptides of selected structures for the preparation of a composition 
for regulating blood levels of amino acids administered parenterally to a patient, 

the peptides providing the desired amino acids to the patient and the structure of 
the peptides being chosen so as to provide a desired clearance of the amino acids 

from the patient's blood. 
The use according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the peptides are 
dipeptides. 
Use of peptides of selected structures for manufacturing a composition for 
parenteral administering of amino acids to a neonate, the amino acids being 

provided as dipeptides, the structure of the dipeptides being chosen so as to 
provide the amino acids so as to insure a sufficiently rapid clearance of the amino 

acids from the blood of neonates. 
The use according to claim 5 wherein the dipeptides are administered 
intravenously. 
The use according to any of claims 1 to 6 wherein the peptides provide at 
least one amino acid chosen from glutamine, tyrosine, glycine and phenylalanine. 
The use according to any of claims 1 to 7 wherein the peptides are chosen 
from GlyTyr; AlaTyr; TyrAla; GlnGly; GlyGln; GlnAla; and AlaGln.
