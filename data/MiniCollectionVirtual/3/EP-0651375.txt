<ABSTRACT>
Electrically conductive protective devices provide a current path 
shunting the magnetoresistive (MR) sensor element (35) in a magnetic head 

assembly (21) to discharge static electrical charges without damage to 
the MR sensor element. A variable conductance device (80) having a nonlinear 

current-voltage characteristic, such as a pair of Schottky diodes, 
for example, is connected between the MR sensor element leads in parallel 

with the MR sensor element or between each MR sensor element lead and a 
ground reference, the MR sensor element magnetic shields, for example, to 

provide a discharge current bypass path. Alternatively, one or more 
bleed resistors (133) are connected between the MR sensor element leads 

and a ground reference to provide the current bypass path thus allowing 
any static charge to bleed off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electrical protection 
circuitry for magnetic disk drives and more particularly to such 
circuitry to protect against electrostatic discharge or electrical 
overstress in read/write transducers utilizing magnetoresistive read 
sensors. Magnetic head disk drive systems have been widely accepted in the 
computer industry as a cost effective form of data storage. In a 
magnetic disk drive system a magnetic recording medium, in the form of a 
disk, rotates at high speed while a magnetic read/write transducer, 
referred to as a magnetic head, "flies" slightly above the surface of the 
rotating disk. The magnetic disk is rotated by means of a spindle drive 
motor. The magnetic head is attached to or formed integrally with a 
"slider" which is suspended over the disk on a spring-loaded support arm 
known as the actuator arm. As the magnetic disk rotates at operating 
speed the moving air generated by the rotating disk in conjunction with 
the physical design of the slider operate to lift the magnetic head 
allowing it to glide or fly slightly above and over the disk surface on a 
cushion of air, referring to as an air bearing. The flying height of the 
magnetic head over the disk surface is typically only a few microinches 
or less and is primarily a function of disk rotation, the aerodynamic 
properties of the slider assembly and the force exerted by the spring-loaded 
actuator arm. A major problem that is encountered during manufacture, handling 
and use of magnetic recording transducers, referred to as heads, is the 
buildup of electrostatic charges on the various elements of a head or 
other objects which come into contact with the heads, particular heads of 
the thin film type, and the accompanying spurious discharge of the static 
electricity thus generated. Static charges may be produced by the 
presence of certain materials, such as plastics, during manufacture and 
subsequent handling of the heads, for example. These charges arc across 
the edge of the insulating layer between the magnetic pole tips and 
adjacent conductive layers which are exposed and positioned adjacent to 
the transducing gap at the air bearing surface facing the recording 
medium thus causing erosion of the pole tips and degradation of the 
transducer in reading and writing of data.  The above-described electrostatic discharge (ESD) problems 
associated with thin film inductive read/write heads are well-documented 
and several solutions have been proposed. U.S. Patent No. 4,317,149
