<ABSTRACT>
A reel change device (1) whereby a first strip 
(3a), unwound off a runout reel (7a), and a second strip 

(3b), unwound off a new reel (7b), are fed along an 
S-shaped path defined by two adjacent suction conveyor 

rollers (34, 35) with selectively-activated suction 
devices (40, 41); the speed and timing of the strips 

(3a, 3b) are synchronized; the strips (3a, 3b) are then 
cut simultaneously along a first portion of the path, 

defined by the first roller (34), and are connected end 
to end as they travel at constant speed (V1) along a 

second portion of the path; and the cut-off portion of 
the second strip (3b) is fed by the first roller (34) to 

a disposal container (64).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reel change 
device for feed devices supplying strip material to a 
user machine. In particular, the present invention relates to a 
reel change device whereby the trailing end of a first 
strip unwound off a runout reel is spliced substantially 
automatically, and without stopping the machine, to the 
leading end of a second strip unwound off a new reel. Known reel change devices of the aforementioned 
type can be divided substantially into two categories: a 
first comprising devices whereby the two strips are 
spliced, end to end or in overlapping manner, by 
stopping the first strip inside a splicing station; and 
the second comprising devices such as the one described 
in US Patent n. 4,415,127, whereby the two strips are 
spliced without being stopped. Devices of the first type are invariably of 
considerable size, mainly due to the presence of 
cumbersome compensating stores for storing a certain  
 
amount of the first strip for use by the machine during 
the splicing operation. On the other hand, a typical drawback of devices 
of the second type is that they fail to provide, simply 
and relatively cheaply, for accurate butt splicing, thus 
resulting in a certain amount of waste strip material on 
the machine. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a straightforward, low-cost reel change device, 
in particular of the second type described above, for 
accurately splicing the two strips end to end. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a reel change device for feed devices supplying 
strip material to a user machine; the reel change device 
comprising a first and second unwinding station for a 
first and second reel of respectively first and second 
strip material; means defining a path along which the 
strip material is fed in a given unwinding direction; 
and cutting means and splicing means located along said 
path, for cutting and splicing the strip material; 
characterized by the fact that it also comprises a first 
and second conveyor in series with each other, the first 
upstream from the second in said unwinding direction, 
and adjacent to each other at a transfer station at 
which the strip material is transferred from the first 
to the second conveyor, the conveyors respectively 
defining a first and second portion of said path; strip 
material disposal means at the transfer station; and  
 
first and second selectively-activated retaining means 
arranged in series along said path, for respectively 
retaining the strip

<CLAIMS>
A reel change device (1) for feed devices (2) 
supplying strip material (3) to a user machine; the reel 

change device (1) comprising a first (21) and second 
(22) unwinding station for a first (7b) and second (7a) 

reel of respectively first (3b) and second (3a) strip 
material; means (34, 35) defining a path along which the 

strip material (3) is fed in a given unwinding 
direction; and cutting means (42) and splicing means 

(46) located along said path, for cutting and splicing 
the strip material (3); characterized by the fact that 

it also comprises a first (34) and second (35) conveyor 
in series with each other, the first upstream from the 

second in said unwinding direction, and adjacent to each 
other at a transfer station (36) at which the strip 

material (3) is transferred from the first (34) to the 
second (35) conveyor, the conveyors (34, 35) 

respectively defining a first and second portion of said 
path; strip material disposal means (64) at the transfer 

station (36); and first (40) and second (41) 
selectively-activated retaining means arranged in series 

along said path, for respectively retaining the strip 
material (3) on the first (34) and second (35) conveyor; 

the cutting means (42) and splicing means (46) being 
located along said path along the first (34) and second 

(35) conveyor respectively. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
 

by the fact that said path comprises a bend at said 
transfer station (36); said first (21) and second (22)
