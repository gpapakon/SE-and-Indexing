<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel carton of the type
usually formed of paperboard, or the like, and including
overlapping inner and outer closure panels which are
provided with primary and secondary locks, or latches,
comprised of apertures formed in or adjacent to the inner
closure panel for receiving locking tabs formed as part
of, or attached to, the outer closure panel.More particularly, the present invention provides
for novel primary and secondary locking arrangements for
holding the carton in a generally tubular configuration.Cartons of the general type which include
cooperative latching means, including primary and
secondary locks, for maintaining wraparound blanks in the
form of a tubular carton have been previously known.
Such cartons and blanks therefore, are exemplified by
those disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,655,117, granted on
April 11, 1972; 4,200,220, granted on April 29, 1980;
4,526,316, granted on July 2, 1985; and 4,708,284,
granted on November 24, 1987. These patents show a
variety of primary and secondary locks which are
described as being useful for securing articles within
the resulting carton or package.The prior art is also exemplified by U.S. Patent
3,375,968, granted on April 2, 1968. This patent
discloses a plurality of containers which may be placed
in side-by-side relation and are also shown in aligned
double rows. GB-A-1329170 on which the preamble of claim 1 is
based shows a construction of a generally tubular carton.An object of the invention is to provide a novel
carton and secondary lock therefore. According to the
present invention, there is provided a locking
arrangement for cartons having overlapping closure panels
including an inner closure panel and an outer closure, a
male locking member carried by and attached to the outer
closure panel, the inner closure panel being connected to
a second panel along a generally transversely extending
fold line and including a cutout portion for receiving
the male locking member, the cutout portion being located
within the confines of the inner closure panel primarily
on one side of the fold line and having a generally
arcuate boundary said locking arrangement being
characterised by said generally arcuate boundary having
ends thereof joined by a rectilinear chord extending
therebetween, and by locking ear means located along the
fold line adjacent the chord and the cutout portion for
being engaged by the male locking member for retaining
the male locking member within the cutout portion.Another object of the invention is to provide

member (14) located along said fold line and including a

cutout portion (34) for receiving said male locking
member (52), said cutout portion (34) being located

substantially within the confines of said inner closure
panel (30) primarily on one side of said fold line (32)

and having a generally arcuate boundary (36), said
locking arrangement being characterised by said generally

arcuate boundary (36) having ends thereof joined by a
rectilinear chord (38) extending therebetween, and by

locking ear means (40) located along said fold line (32)
adjacent said chord (38) and said cutout portion (34) for

being engaged by said male locking member (52) for
retaining said male locking member within said cutout

A locking arrangement as defined in claim 1
wherein said cutout portion (34) is generally semi-circular

and provides a substantially large opening for
receiving said male locking member (52) therein.
A locking arrangement as defined in either
claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said locking ear means

comprise a pair of tab members (40) carried by said inner
panel (30) adjacent to said cutout portion (34). 
A locking arrangement as defined in any one
preceding claim wherein said tab members (40) are cut
