<ABSTRACT>
A piercing tip (10) for penetrating body tissue is provided which includes a 
conical body (12) and a triangular cutting blade (24) positioned 

within a slot (22) formed in 
the conical body. The cutting blade includes a proximal mounting flange (111) (Fig. 6) 

which extends outwardly from the conical body and is configured for mounting at the 
distal end of an obturator of a trocar assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tissue piercing members and to trocar
assemblies which incorporate such tissue piercing members.Trocar assemblies are well known devices for piercing body walls so as to
gain access to underlying structures. In the context of minimally invasive surgical and
diagnostic procedures, e.g., laparoscopic, thoracoscopic and arthroscopic procedures,
the trocar is utilized to facilitate introduction of a cannula or guide sleeve through the
body wall. The cannula, once positioned, provides a port of entry for additional
instrumentation, e.g., an endoscope, clip applier, scissors, graspers, retractors, and the
like. Recently, the development of essential mechanical instrumentation for use through
cannulae has enabled the widespread acceptance of numerous minimally invasive
procedures.In introducing the initial trocar/cannula assembly through the body wall,
the surgeon generally has no visualization of the body cavity or the location of internal
structures. To provide an increased margin of safety, trocars have been developed which
provide mechanisms adapted to cover the piercing member upon entry into the body
cavity, e.g., SU 921554 to Markelov, U.S. 4,601,710 to Moll et al. and U.S. 5,116,353
to Green.In utilizing trocar/cannula assemblies, the surgeon's control during entry is
at least in part predicated on the penetration force required to pass the trocar through the
body wall. The lower the force required, the more control the surgeon will have during
entry. Thus, for example, U.S. 4,654,030 to Moll et al. provides a safety shielded trocar
in which the safety shield is designed to minimize the trocar's penetration force. A
variety of trocar piercing tip designs have also been disclosed, e.g., pyramidal and conical
tips. U.S. 1,380,447 to Westcott discloses a trocar which includes a perforator or blade
having a sharp tapered point and two sharp cutting edges. See also U.S. 4,499,898 to
Knepshield et al. (surgical knife with controllably extendable blade), U.S. 3,584,624 to
de Clutiis (catheter which receives rigid stylet with a cutting edge), U.S. 4,414,974 to
Dotson et al. (microsurgical knife), U.S. 5,232,440 to Wilk (assembly for draining
abscesses) and U.K. 1,356,386 to Moss et al. (artery entry tool). The design of the 
trocar's piercing tip will also influence the degree to which tissue is traumatized during trocar
entry.A need thus exists for a piercing tip design which maximizes the surgeon's
control during trocar entry by reducing penetration force and which minimizes

<CLAIMS>
A piercing tip (10, 100) for use in piercing body
tissue comprising:


(a) a body (12) defining a conical face portion
and a base of circular cross-section; and
(b) a substantially planar cutting blade (24,
110) having a triangular cutting region, the piercing

tip being 
characterised in that
:
(c) the triangular cutting region (110a)
exhibits an isosceles triangle with a pair of cutting

edges (25),
(d) the body is formed in first (14, 104) and
second (16, 106) portions, for receiving the cutting

blade between the first and second portions;
(e) the first body portion has an outward facing
surface (14d, 104d) of part frusto-conical form and

the second body portion has facing distal and proximal
wall surfaces between which the first body portion is

received; and
(f) the cutting blade is positioned within the
slot (22, 122) formed in the body between its first

and second portions, such that the triangular cutting
region extends at least in part beyond the conical

face portion of the body.
A piercing tip as claimed in claim 1, wherein the slot
is transverse to the base of the conical body. 
A piercing tip as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
body defines a vertex and the slot is in a plane which

transects the vertex.
A piercing tip as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the first body portion defines a

distal face (14a, 104a), a proximal face (146), a
planar side wall (14c, 104c) and an outward facing

surface (14d, 104d).
A piercing tip as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the second body portion defines a

distal conical portion (16a, 106a), an intermediate
partial frustoconical portion (16b, 106b), and a

proximal cylindrical portion (18, 114).
A piercing tip as claimed in claim 5, wherein said
planar cutting blade defines an aperture (31, 130)

which is adapted to receive the distal conical portion
therethrough.
A piercing tip as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, further comprising an attachment member (26)

for securing the cutting blade to the body.
A piercing tip of any of the preceding claims, wherein
from a base of the triangular cutting region of the

planar cutting blade extends a substantially
rectangular region.
A piercing tip as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
width of the rectangular region is no greater than the

diameter of the circular base of the body. 
A piercing tip as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, wherein the side walls of the isoceles

triangle are substantially parallel to the conical face portion
of the body.
A piercing tip as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, wherein the cutting blade includes a proximal

mounting flange configured to mount to an obturator.
A trocar comprising:

an obturator (150) defining a longitudinal axis;
and, mounted to the obturator,
a conical piercing tip as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims
The trocar of claim 12, wherein the piercing tip
includes a flange which projects outwardly from the

circular base which mounts to the obturator.
