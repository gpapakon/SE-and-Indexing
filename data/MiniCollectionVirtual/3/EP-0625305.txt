<ABSTRACT>
A bacterial composition and method for inhibiting the growth of 
bacteria particularly the capsulated, facultative bacterium, 
Klebsiella 
pneumoniae
. The composition comprises 2-(2-bromo-2-nitroethenyl) 
furan (BNEF) and an additional biocidal component. The method 

comprises administering between about 0.1 to about 200 parts of the 
composition (based on one million parts of the desired aqueous system) 

to the particular water containing system for which treatment is desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions and methods for controlling 
the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae.The formation of slimes by microorganisms is a problem that is 
encountered in many aqueous systems. For example, the problem is not 
only found in natural waters such as lagoons, lakes, ponds, etc., and 
confined waters as in pools, air washer systems and pulp and paper mill 
systems. All possess conditions which are conducive to the growth and 
reproduction of slime-forming microorganisms. In both once-through and 
recirculating cooling systems, for example, which employ large quantities 
of water as a cooling medium, the formation of slime by microorganisms 
is an extensive and constant problem.  Airborne organisms are readily entrained in the water from cooling 
towers and find this warm medium an ideal environment for growth and 
multiplication. Aerobic and heliotropic organisms flourish on the tower 
proper while other organisms colonize and grow in such areas as the 
tower sump and the piping and passages of the cooling system. The 
slime formation not only aids in the deterioration of the tower structure in 
the case of wooden towers, but also promotes corrosion when it deposits 
on metal surfaces. Slime carried through the cooling system plugs and 
fouls lines, valves, strainers, etc., and deposits on heat exchange 
surfaces. In the latter case, the impedance of heat transfer can greatly 
reduce the efficiency of the cooling system. In pulp and paper mill systems, slime formed by microorganisms is 
commonly encountered and causes fouling, plugging or corrosion of the 
system. The slime also becomes entrained in the paper produced to 
cause breakouts on the paper machines, which results in work stoppages 
and the loss of production time. The slime is also responsible for 
unsightly blemishes in the final product, which result in rejects and 
wasted output. The previously discussed problems have resulted in the extensive 
utilization of biocides in cooling water and pulp and paper mill systems. 
Materials which have enjoyed widespread use in such applications 
include chlorine, chlorinated phenols, organo-bromines, and various 
organo-sulfur compounds. All of these compounds are generally useful 
for this purpose but each is attended by a variety of impediments. For 
example, chlorination is limited both by its specific toxicity for slime-forming 
organisms at economic levels and by the tendency of chlorine to 
react, which results in the expenditure of the chlorine before its full  
 
biocidal
