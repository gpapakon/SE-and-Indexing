<ABSTRACT>
To improve the sidetone suppression of electro-acoustic devices, in particular to improve the hands-free characteristics of a telecommunications terminal, with compander control by means of an echo evaluation circuit (52) assigned to the compander (4), an echo canceller (40) is connected upstream of the compander (4) and/or a voice-controlled balance (51) is connected downstream of the compander (4), said echo canceller and balance being controlled by the echo-evaluation circuit (52) of the compander (4). The means normally required to control the function of the echo canceller (40) and/or voice-controlled balance (51) can be dispensed with. A particularly effective and economical method with very good hands-free characteristics is obtained.
