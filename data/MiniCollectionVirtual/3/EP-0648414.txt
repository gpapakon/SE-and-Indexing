<ABSTRACT>
Fully water-dilutable microemulsions are disclosed comprising comprising 

(A) an active ingredient which has a solubility in water of less than 1% at room 
temperature and a melting point of less than 100°C; 
(B) a non-polar, water immiscible solvent capable of dissolving at least 5% by weight of 

(A) at room temperature; 
(C) a surfactant system comprising: 

(C1) at least one sulfated of sulfonated anionic surfactant having about 3-17% 
sulfation or sulfonation; and 
(C2) at least one ethoxylated surfactant; and 
(D) 0 to 99.9 % by weight water;
 

   the weight ratio of (C1) to (C2) being from 10/90 to 90/10;
 

   the weight ratio of said (A) to (B) being from 95/5 to 1/99, and
 

   the weight ratio of said (A) to (C) being from 1/99 to 86/14; 
 
   said composition being thermodynamically stable and clear, opalescent, or only 

slightly cloudy at all levels of water dilution up to 99.9%. 
The microemulsions are particularly useful in areas where preservation is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microemulsions of water-insoluble active ingredients having
microbicidal, herbicidal, insecticidal, plant growth regulating or pharmaceutical activity.Microemulsions containing water-insoluble biocidal or pesticidal agents have been
proposed in, for example:US 5,013,748, which discloses aqueous biocidal microemulsions useful for the protection
of wood. The biocidal components employed contain at least one triazole fungicide, at least one
quaternary ammonium fungicide and at least one benzimidazole fungicide in a liquid carrier
comprising at least two necessary polar solvents. This patent does not teach fully water dilutable
systems.US 4,954,338, which teaches oil-in-water microemulsions of isothiazolones with low
water solubility with EO/PO copolymer/anionic sulfates or sulfonates as microemulsifier. The
solvents are alkyl alcohols or alkylalkoxylated alcohols. This patent requires the use of EO/PO
(ethylene oxide/propylene oxide) copolymer to maintain the microemulsion with dilution by
water.US 4,567,161, which discloses transparent microemulsions with active ingredients (e.g.
pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals) together with a phospholipid and a coemulsifier
(glycerin ester).CA 1209361, which discloses cold stable aqueous microemulsions of agrochemical
pesticides, household pest control agents, and pharmaceuticals using an emulsifier which is a
mixture of alkylaryl polyglycol and an alkylarylsulfonate salt.US 4,973,352, which discloses aqueous microemulsions for only herbicidal use
containing a combination of a herbicide, one or more emulsifiers or wetting agents such as
calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one or more organic solvents and water. This patent also does
not teach fully water dilutable microemulsions.US 4,904,695, which discloses an aqueous based insecticidal microemulsion comprising
a synthetic pyrethroid/organophosphate, surfactant blend, adjuvants, such as antifoamers,
thickeners and preservatives, and water. The microemulsions of this patent are not fully water
dilutable.US 4,995,900 discloses only water/oil microemulsion formulations of water-insoluble
herbicides and are, therefore, not fully water dilutable.Fully water dilutable microemulsions, especially of certain insoluble biocidal active
ingredients, have not been previously known and available. By fully water dilutable is meant a
microemulsion which is water-dilutable from water-free concentrates (referred to as
microemulsion concentrates) to microemulsion containing large concentrations of water.The
