<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel semicarbazide/urethane 
mixture which is useful as a stabilizer for polyurethane. More particularly, the 
invention concerns such a stabilizer which is derived from 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole, an 
aliphatic polyisocyanate and a reduced sugar or glycerol and is particularly useful as 
a stabilizer for spandex. Polyurethanes derived from polyethers or polyesters, especially those 
intended for use in spandex, require projection against discoloration caused by 
oxidation, atmospheric fumes, nitrogen oxide gases and exposure to light. Many 
stabilizers have been disclosed for use in these polymers. For example, U.S. 
3,399,167, Rosendahl et al, discloses 1,1-dialkyl-semicarbazides and 1,1-dialkylcarbazinic 
acid esters as stabilizers for polyurethanes. Most of the many 
semicarbazides disclosed by Rosendahl et al, are derived from asymmetrically 
substituted dialkyl hydrazines; only one is derived from a triazole, namely the bis-semicarbazide 
of the reaction of 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole and hexamethylene 
diisocyanate. However, the present inventors found that this semicarbazide 
compound is only sparingly soluble in solvents usually employed for dry spinning 
spandex and therefore is not practically usable for producing spandex. U.S. 4,973,618, Ultee discloses protecting spandex from discoloration 
by atmospheric fumes and/or light, with oligomeric additives of 1,000 to 5,000 
molecular weight, prepared from polyether glycols, diisocyanates and 1,1-dialkylhydrazines. 
These oligomers avoid problems of additive extraction during 
scrubbing, washing and like operations, as was commonly encountered with 
previously known semicarbazide additives. Generally, the stabilizers disclosed by, Ultee and by Rosendahl et al 
(except for the bis-semicarbazide derived from 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole) require 
unsymmetrical dialkylhydrazines for their manufacture. However, unsymmetrical 
dialkylhydrazines are highly toxic, and the 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, the most 
commonly used dialkylhydrazine is a flammable, carcinogenic compound that 
oxidizes to dimethyl nitrosamine, which is an even more powerful carcinogen. U.S. Patent No. 5,028,642, Goodrich et al, discloses improved 
spandex containing zinc oxide and a polyhydroxy additive selected from certain 
sugars, reduced sugars and/or polyhydroxy urethanes formed from the sugars or 
reduced sugars and an organic diisocyanate.  
 The objects of the present invention are to provide a stabilizer for 
spandex that (a) is soluble in solvents
