<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
preparing fluid for medical treatment. Various systems are known for preparing fluid for 
medical treatment, each of which normally presents a 
hydraulic circuit, sensor means, and an electronic 
apparatus to which the sensor means are connected and 
which provides for controlling the hydraulic circuit. 
Such systems operate differently and present specific 
component configurations according to the type of fluid 
to be prepared and the treatment involved, which 
basically means a system suitable for one fluid is 
unsuitable for another. Moreover, practically all the components of known 
systems are fixed, i.e. used repeatedly for more than 
one preparation cycle, so that they must be sterilized 
after each cycle with all the disadvantages this 
entails, such as the high cost of the sterilizing 
equipment and the downtime involved for the actual 
sterilizing operation. Publication DE-A-491 981 relates to a fixed mixer  
 
to which the two compounds of a dialysis fluid are 
supplied, and featuring a circuit for recirculating the 
fluid, the preparation process being controlled by a 
processing unit on the basis of sensor-detected 
parameters. A major drawback of this system is that it 
fails to provide for rapidly dissolving the two 
compounds. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a system and process for preparing fluid for 
medical treatment, designed to overcome the 
aforementioned drawbacks, i.e. which provides for 
rapidly dissolving the compounds, preparing different 
fluids for different medical treatments, and eliminating 
sterilization of at least some of the components. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a system for preparing fluid for medical 
treatment by dissolving a first chemical compound in a 
second chemical compound; the system comprising a 
hydraulic circuit with a container to which are 
connected a first tube by which a predetermined amount 
of said second compound is channelled to the container, 
a second tube by which, at the end of the preparation 
cycle, the prepared fluid is channelled from the 
container to a user device, and a third tube presenting 
a portion external to the container and two end portions 
communicating with the container, and comprising pumping 
means fitted to said external portion, for recirculating 
the fluid being prepared to and from the container;  
 
characterized in that a predetermined amount of said 
first compound is contained inside the container; and 
that a
