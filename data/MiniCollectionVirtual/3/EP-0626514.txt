<ABSTRACT>
A fuel supply system is provided for an internal 
combustion engine using a fuel injector 7 with an 

additional fuel heater H to assist in heating fuel F from 
the injector 7 under specific engine conditions. A control 

unit 70 is used to sense the specific engine conditions and 
control a supply of gas A2 from a source coordinated with 

the operation of the fuel injector 7. When gas is supplied 
from the source, it contacts the fuel 7 from the injector 

so as to vary the amount of fuel to come into contact with 
the fuel heater H. In one embodiment, the fuel injector 7, 

heater H2 and gas source are all part of an integral 
injector assembly 57.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel supply system, and more 
particularly to a fuel supply system which can be suitably used 
for an internal combustion engine. In the past, in a spark ignition gasoline internal 
combustion engine, a carburetor was used for mixing gasoline with 
the air that has been taken in and supplying same to the 
combustion chamber. The carburetor has the function of atomizing 
the gasoline by utilizing the negative pressure inside the engine 
and, if necessary, by automatically supplying a suitable amount 
of air to make a combustible gas. Typically today, however, in passenger automobiles a fuel 
supply system utilizing a fuel injector has replaced the use of a 
carburetor. This change has at least in part been brought about 
by the use of electronic control in the total automobile. As 
improvements in electronic control has occurred also, 
improvements in injector performance has occurred. The injector provides the function of positively atomizing 
and injecting gasoline into the combustion chamber without 
relying upon the negative pressure in the engine. Coupled with 
electronic control, it can provide better engine response 
(including cold start-up and acceleration) than typical previous 
carburetor systems.  Figure 20 shows a prior art control system of a gasoline 
engine incorporating an electronic control fuel injection system. 
Upon start up of an engine, the gasoline is sent from the fuel 
tank 41 by means of a fuel pump 43 and supplied to an injector 7 
which has been provided at each branch tube of a manifold 5 
through a switch-over valve 44. The injected fuel is mixed 
together with air from the air intake (which will be described 
later) in the gas passageway 2b of the cylinder head 2. The air from the air intake is introduced to the manifold 5 
through an air cleaner 46 and an air valve 48 which controls the 
amount of the air intake. In addition, the air intake supplies 
air to an injector 7 from the branched tube 49 through a pressure 
adjuster 51 and the switch-over valve 44. From the injector 7, 
fuel mixed with air is injected into the passageway 2b and is fed 
to the combustion chamber 18 as a mixed gas. A water temperature sensor 53 detects the temperature of the 
cooling water inside a cooling water jacket 23; and based upon 
reading of this temperature sensor, an injector control computer 
58 controls the amount of the gasoline in the injector relative 
to the amount of the air intake. In the figure, code 63 
indicates an oxygen sensor that detects the

<CLAIMS>
A fuel supply device for an engine comprising a fuel 
injection means for supplying a stream of fuel to the 

engine, a fuel heating means for heating fuel that comes 
in contact with said fuel heating means, a gas supply 

means for supplying a stream of gas to contact the stream 
of fuel, and control means for controlling said gas supply 

means so as to vary the amount of fuel to come into contact 
with said fuel heating means. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 1 wherein 
said control means responds to predetermined engine 

conditions to selectively control the stream of gas from 
the gas supply means. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 1 or 2 
wherein said gas supply means supplies a gas stream in a 

first state and does not supply a gas stream in a second 
state in response to a signal from the control means. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 3 wherein 
said gas supply means in said first state varies the 

direction of said stream of fuel to increase the amount of 
fuel that contacts said fuel heating means. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 3 wherein 
said gas supply means in said first state varies the 

direction of said stream of fuel to decrease the amount of 
fuel that contacts said fuel heating means. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 1 wherein 
said gas supply means varies the direction of said stream 

of fuel to essentially prevent fuel from contacting said 
fuel heating means. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 1 which 
includes a fuel passageway to the engine and said gas 

supply means is a separate source of gas from gas in said 
fuel passageway. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 1 which 
includes a fuel passageway to the engine and said fuel 

injector means and said fuel heater means are provided in a 
wall part of the fuel passageway. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 1 which 
includes a fuel passageway to the engine and said fuel 

heater means is contained within said passageway. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 1 in which 
said fuel heater means includes a positive temperature 

coefficient (PTC) element for heating. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in any one of claims 
1 to 5 in which said engine has at least one combustion 

chamber and said stream of fuel from said fuel injector 
means is directed toward one of the at least one combustion 

chamber. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in any one of claims 
1 to 5 in which said engine has at least one combustion 

chamber and said fuel injection means is directed toward 
said fuel heater means. 
A fuel supply device as set forth in claim 1 in which 
said fuel injection means, said fuel heater means and said 

gas supply means are all part of a fuel injection assembly. 
A fuel supply device of claim 13 wherein said fuel 
stream is formed from gas and fuel in the fuel injection 

assembly which is contacted by gas from the gas supply 
 

means within said fuel injection assembly to alter the flow 
path of the fuel stream to contact said heater means.
