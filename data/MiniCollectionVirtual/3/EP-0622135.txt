<ABSTRACT>
A punching die includes a punch body (5), a punch guide (3) 
fitted on the punch body movably up and down with respect to 

the punch body, a punch head (30) provided on a top portion of the 
punch body, a gaseous spring (13) provided between the punch body 

and the punch guide for pushing the punch guide downwardly 
with respect to the punch body. The gaseous spring is 

cylindrical and fitted on the punch body detachably, and 
includes device (40,41) for restricting a maximum length of the 

gaseous spring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a punching die using a 
gaseous spring as indicated in the preamble portion of claim 1 
Such a punch die assembly comprising a punch body which is 
movable in the vertical direction and using a gaseous spring is 
already known from US-PS-4 292 869. In this case, said punch 
body is received in a hold down sleeve which is movable 
relative to said punch body and in a piston which abuts onto 
the punch head. Said hold down sleeve is slidably received in 
a cylindrical bore formed in the lower portion of said piston 
so as to define a pressure chamber filled with pressurized gas 
to urge the hold down sleeve downwards with respect to the 
punch body. In the conventional punching die, a punch body movable up 
and down is fitted to a punch guide, and further a spring such 
as coil spring, a disk spring, an urethane spring, etc. are 
interposed between the retainer collar and a punch head fixed 
to the upper portion of the punch guide. In the above-mentioned conventional technique, however, 
when the spring is assembled between the retainer collar and 
the punch head, there exists a problem in that the spring must 
be deformed to some extent so a strong force is required to 
deform the spring for assembly. In addition, when the cutting 
edge of the punch body is required to be ground again, the 
retainer collar, the punch head and the spring must be all 
disassembled. In this disassembly work, since some parts are 
tightly assembled or fitted from the standpoint of the punch 
head structure, it is not easy to disassemble these parts.  
 Further, after the cutting edge of the punch body has 
been ground again, the length of the assembled punch body must 
be adjusted. In this case, since a strong force is required 
for assembly, there exists a problem in that the adjustment 
work is not easy. With these problems in mind, therefore, it is the object 
of the present invention to provide a punching die easy to 
assemble the spring, easy to adjust the punch body length 
after cutting edge of the punching body has been ground and 
easy to manage the cutting edge of the punching body, for 
keeping the punching die under excellent conditions all the 
time. To achieve the above-mentioned object, the present 
invention provides a punching die having the features of claim 1. This punching die 
comprises a punch body, a punch guide fitted on said punch 
body movably up and down with respect to said punch body, a 
punch head provided on a top portion of said punch body, and a 
gaseous

<CLAIMS>
A punching die comprising: 

a punch body (5); 
a punch guide (3) receiving therein said punch body and 
being movable up and down with respect to said punch 

body; 
a punch head (30) provided on a top portion of said 
punch body; and 
a gaseous spring (13) acting between said punch body (5) 
and said punch guide (3) for pushing said punch guide 

downwardly with respect to said punch body; 
said gaseous spring (13) comprises 
a gas charging chamber (29) being defined by an inner 
cylinder (14), a piston (15), an outer cylinder (16) and a cylinder 

end (17), 
said inner cylinder (14) being provided on said punch 
body (5);
characterized in that
said piston (15) being provided on an upper portion of 
said inner cylinder and having a flange (40) extending 

outwards;  
 
said outer cylinder (16) receiving therein said piston 
so as to be movable in upward and downward directions 

with respect to said piston, and having a reduced 
diameter portion (41) extending inwards; 
said cylinder end (17) being provided in a lower portion 
of said outer cylinder and receiving therein said inner 

cylinder (14) so as to be movable in upward and downward 
directions with respect to said inner cylinder; and 
said flange (40) of said piston being engageable with 
said reduced diameter portion (41) of said outer 

cylinder so as to define a maximum length of said 
gaseous spring and to restrict said gaseous spring to the 

maximum length. 
The punching die according to claim 1, wherein said 
gaseous spring (13) is cylindrical and detachable from 

said punch body. 
The punching die according to claim 1, wherein said 
punch head (30) is screwed on said top portion of said 

punch body (5), and said piston (15) is screwed on a 
portion of said punch body under said punch head, said 

punch head being apart from said piston by a 
predetermined gap in an axial direction, and
 
wherein said punching die further comprises means (32) 

for exerting an attractive force between said punch head 
and said gaseous spring on said punch head and said 

gaseous spring. 
The punching die according to claim 3, wherein said 
exerting means is a bolt (32).
