<ABSTRACT>
A connector apparatus (10) provides an interconnection 
between an IC pack (14) and a printed circuit board 

(16). The apparatus includes a header connector (12) for 
mounting on the printed circuit board and into which the IC 

pack is inserted and ejected. A plurality of terminals 
(24) on the header connector are adapted for interconnection 

of the IC pack to electrical traces on the printed 
circuit board. An IC pack ejector mechanism (18) is 

mounted on the header connector and includes a reciprocally 
mounted actuator member for effecting ejection of the IC 

pack from the header connector terminals. An electrical 
switch (30) is provided on the header connector and is 

actuatable in response to movement of the actuator member 
upon insertion or ejection of an IC pack. The switch is 

interconnected to electrical traces on the printed circuit 

board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to connector apparatus for
providing an interconnection between an IC pack and a
printed circuit board through a plurality of terminals,
according to the preamble of claim 1.Such an apparatus is disclosed in US-A-5,033,972. The
connector apparatus contains a header connector for mounting
on a printed circuit board, a plurality of terminals on the
header connector adapted for interconnection of the IC pack
to electrical traces on the printed circuit board, and an IC
pack ejector mechanism mounted on the header connector and
including a manual actuating member, a transfer member, and
a slider as an ejector member. The manual actuator member
has a holding portion for the IC packs which is effective
when the IC pack is inserted. A switch is arranged in the
pivotional area of the manual actuator means so as to
indicate the position thereof.A conventional connector apparatus for an IC pack or
memory card includes a generally U-shaped housing having a
pair of guide grooves inside a pair of side frame portions,
with a connector section joining or extending between the
side frame portions. A planar IC pack is inserted into the
apparatus within the side guide grooves. A transverse array
of socket terminals at an edge of the IC pack electrically
interconnect with an associated array of pin terminals on
the connector section.Such connector apparatus often are provided as header
connectors used for interconnecting the semiconductor
circuit of the IC pack to an external circuit such as a main
electronic unit. The header connector may be used with an
IC pack or memory card for removably coupling the IC pack to
a printed circuit board. The IC pack is inserted into the
header connector and is extracted therefrom as needed. The
extraction force of the IC pack, i.e. the force between the
respective terminal pins on the header connector and the
respective socket terminals of the IC pack, is relatively
high due to the tight fit required to obtain a good
electrical interconnection between the 
terminals. The terminals typically are disposed at a high
density which further increases the extraction forces.
Often, when an IC pack is to be extracted from a header
connector, the card is grasped by a user and simply pulled
out. Consequently, a variety of ejecting mechanisms have
been incorporated in various connector apparatus, such as
the header connectors, for facilitating ejecting an IC pack
from a header connector.One of the problems with IC pack connector apparatus of
the characters described above,

<CLAIMS>
A connector apparatus (10) for providing an
interconnection between an IC pack (14) and a printed

circuit board (16) through a plurality of terminals (24),
comprising:


a header connector (12) into which the IC pack (14)is
inserted and from which it is ejected, and which includes

said terminals (24),
an IC pack ejector mechanism (18) mounted on the header
connector (12) and adapted to effect disconnection of

the IC pack (14) from the header connector (12) including
a reciprocally mounted actuator member (42), an ejector

lever (34) and a pivot connection (40) between actuator
member (42) and ejector lever (34), and
an electrical switch (30) adapted to be actuaded in
response to movement of the IC pack, and
including an actuatable portion located in the path of
movement of the actuator member (42)

characterized in that

said actuator member (42) extends to said header
connector (12) and
said electrical switch (30) is mounted on said header
connector (12) and has a pair of spaced-apart contacts

(50, 52), one (50) of said contacts being located in
the path of said reciprocating actuator member (42), such

that upon ejection of an IC pack, a portion of the actuator
member (42) closes the switch contacts (50, 52) before the

connection between IC pack and header is broken.
The connector apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein said spaced-apart contacts (50, 52) are

closed in response to movement of the actuator member along
a predetermined length

within the ejector mechanism (18).
The connector apparatus according to claim 2,
wherein said portion of the actuator member (42) includes a

boss (62) which is adapted to move

the one (50) of the pair of spaced-apart contacts
(50, 52).
The connector apparatus (10) according to
any of claims 1 - 3 wherein said

ejector mechanism (18), for selectively moving an inserted
IC pack (14) from an inserted position to an ejected

position, has said pivotally mounted ejector lever (34)
engaging the IC pack (14) and effecting movement thereof

to the ejected position, and

actuator member (42) is slidably mounted for movement in
the

same general direction as the insertion and ejection of
the IC pack.
