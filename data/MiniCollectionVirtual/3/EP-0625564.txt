<ABSTRACT>
Lubricating grease compositions based on titanium 
complex soap thickener in mineral and synthetic 

base oils have been prepared for the first time. 
Tentative methods for preparing lubricating grease 

from this new type of titanium complex soap thickener 
have been described. High performance lubricating grease 

resulted from titanium terphthalate stearate complex 
soap thickener, exhibited excellent mechanical 

stability, high drop point, excellent oxidation 
stability, very good extreme pressure and antiwear 

properties, good water resistance and corrosion 
inhibiting characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the development of high
performance lubricating grease composition based on
completely new type of titanium complex soap thickeners
viz., Titanium terephthalate stearate. Titanium metal
component in complex soap thickener has been derived
from titanium isopropoxide rather than an alkali.
Several carboxylic acid and fatty acid combinations
with titanium isopropoxide have been tried in order
to get a lubricating grease of comparable performance
characteristics with other high performance lubricating
grease as lithium complex, aluminum complex, sulfonate
complex or polyurea greases. Best emerged combination,
terephthalate stearate complex soap in mineral base
stock exhibited, if not better, comparable performance
characteristics to other above mentioned high performance
lubricating greases. In the prior art, metallic soaps and their complex
soaps have generally been used as thickeners in
lubricating grease industry. The continuous large
scale usage of these type of thickeners in grease
formulations is perhaps due to their excellent
thickening capacity, easy availability and cost factors.
Most of these commercially applicable metallic or
complex metallic soap thickeners are derived from
metals such as lithium, calcium, sodium, barium,
aluminium etc., and are well known in the art.
With few exceptions, metallic soaps other than mentioned
previously constitute minor portion of thickeners
in lubricating greases. In fact, in most cases soaps
of miscellaneous metals serve some functions other
than that of thickeners.
However, in early stage C.J. Boner in Ind. Eng.Chem.
29,59(1937) have mentioned the preparation of soaps of
Cd,Ce,Mg,Cr,Co,Hg,Sn in an attempt to prepare lubricating
grease. Nevertheless in course of time these soaps
have not gained commercial significance in lubricating
greases. Similarly, U.S. Patent No.2878236 describes
titanium stearate used as polymerisation catalyst.
Another indication (Klarkes Markley's fatty acid
part-II, Inc.NY 1961,P.717) on titanium stearate
provided the melting point of titanium sterate soap as
62°C. Therefore, perhaps because of low melting
point of these titanium soaps have not been used
as thickeners in lubricating greases. Complex
soaps of titanium, however, have not been reported
so far for lubricating grease purpose.In commercial formulations of lithium and calcium
complex soap base greases,metallic compound used
for their preparation are the oxides/hydroxides of
respective metals. On the other hand, in aluminium
complex soap base
