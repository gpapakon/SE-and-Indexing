<ABSTRACT>
Simulated photographic prints (Fig. 3) are created using xerographic imaging. 
A transparent carrier (25) having a xerographically formed mirror image (67) fused thereto 

is bonded to a plastic substrate (116) through the use of heat and pressure. The 
transparent carrier (25) and the plastic substrate (116) form the finished print.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method for producing
continuous tone images with near photographic print qualities using xerography.In the practice of conventional xerography, it is the general procedure to
form electrostatic latent images on a xerographic surface by first uniformly charging a
charge retentive surface such as a photoreceptor. The charged area is selectively
dissipated in accordance with a pattern of activating radiation corresponding to original
images. The selective dissipation of the charge leaves a latent charge pattern on the
imaging surface corresponding to the areas not exposed by radiation.This charge pattern is made visible by developing it with toner by passing the
photoreceptor past one or more developer housings. In monochromatic imaging, the
toner is generally comprises black thermoplastic powder particles which adhere to the
charge pattern by electrostatic attraction. The developed image is then fixed to the
imaging surface or is transferred to a receiving substrate such as plain paper to which it is
fixed by suitable fusing techniques.Recently, there has been a great deal of effort directed to the development
of color copiers/printers which utilize the xerographic process. Such efforts have resulted
in the recent introduction of the Xerox™ 5775™ copier/printer and the Fuji Xerox A-Color
635 machine.The quality of color xerographic images on paper has approached the quality
of color photographic prints However, color xerographic prints fall short because they do
not have the uniform gloss, dynamic range or brilliance typical of photographic prints. Nor
do xerographic prints have the feel of photographic prints because the paper usually used
is too lightweight and too limp.Typically the surface of color toner images is irregular, therefore, rather
rough or lumpy. The behavior of incident white light vis-a-vis such color images is believed
to be as follows:
Some of the white light incident on the substrate carrying the color toner images
specularly reflects off the substrate.Some of the light goes down into the paper, scatters around and comes back out
in various directions, some through the toner and some not. Because the toner surface is rough or irregular some of the light incident thereon
is reflected off the toner in various directions.Some of the light incident on the irregular toner surfaces passes through the
toner into the paper and comes back out in various directions.White light becomes colored due to selective absorption as it passes through
toner. The light

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming simulated photographic prints,
said method including the steps of:


a) xerographically forming a wrong reading toner
image (67) on one side of a transparent substrate (25);
b) contacting said toner image (67) with one side of
a coloured backing member (116);
c) contacting an other side of said coloured backing

member (116) with an abhesive member (120);
d) contacting the non-image side of said imaged
transparent substrate (25) with a flat rigid surface (100);
e) simultaneously applying heat and pressure at
predetermined values to said imaged transparent substrate

(25), and coloured backing member (116), whereby said
transparent substrate (25) and said backing member (116)

adhere to each other to form said simulated photographic
print;
f) separating said abhesive member (120) from said
another side of said coloured backing member (116); and
g) separating said simulated photographic print from
said flat rigid surface (100).
The method according to claim 1, wherein step (e)
comprises positioning said transparent substrate (25),

backing member (116), abhesive member (120) and flat rigid
surface (100) between a pair of platens (92, 94) at least

one of which is provided with a source (102, 104) of heat
energy capable of elevating the temperature of said

transparent substrate (25) and said coloured backing member
(116).
The method according to claim 2, wherein step (e) is
effected by applying a force to one (92) of said platens in

order to urge it in the direction of the other (94) of said
platens.
The method according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
said backing member (116) (A) has a coating of adhesive 

material (118) on the side thereof which contacts the toner
image (67), and/or (B) is translucent.
The method according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein said abhesive member (120) comprises a polyester

film having a silicone rubber coating (122) on one or each
side thereof.
The method according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the thicknesses of said simulated photographic

print is approximately equal to 229 µm (0.009 inch).
The method according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein said flat rigid surface (100) comprises tempered

glass.
The method according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein said backing member (116) has a coating (118) of

adhesive on both sides thereof.
The method of claim 8, further including the step of:

contacting the other side of said coloured backing
member (116) with a non-imaged transparent substrate (124)

having the same thermal properties as said imaged
transparent substrate (25).
