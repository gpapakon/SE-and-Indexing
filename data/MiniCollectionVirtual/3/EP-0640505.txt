<ABSTRACT>
Covering panel (6) for motor-vehicle sliding roofs, which panel is mounted displaceably below the sliding panel (3), which is assigned displaceably to a roof opening (2), on lateral guide rails (5). The particularly lightweight covering panel (6) which is air-permeable and also light-permeable but acts as a screen against direct exposure to the rays of the sun, essentially comprises a rigid covering frame (9) determining its external shape and dimensions, and a flexible, air-permeable surface material (10) with which the covering frame (9) is covered.

Lining lid for automobile sliding roofs, which is 
slidably mounted on lateral guide rails (5) beneath the 

sliding lid (3) displaceably associated with a roof 
opening (2), consists partly of air-permeable material 

and possesses a stiff lining frame (9), determining its 
external form and dimensions, which frame is covered 

with a flexible, air-permeable areal material (10), 
characterized in that the lining frame (9) is provided, 

on its upper face, with an upwardly open clamping groove 
(11), into which clamping strips (12) which grip the 

areal material (10) and fix it to the lining frame (9) 
are pressed, thus biaxially tensioning the areal 

material (10). 
Lining lid according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the clamping groove (11) is constructed continuously 

around all sides of the lining frame (9), and that the 
clamping strips (12) are combined to a single-piece 

clamping frame, which is complementarily associated with 
the clamping groove (11). 
Lining lid according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the clamping strips (12) have a T-shaped profile cross-section, 

the web of which can be pressed into the 
clamping groove (11) with the areal material (10) 

between, and the flanges of which, after the pressing-in, 
bear upon the upper face of the lining frame (9). 
Lining lid according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the wall faces of the clamping groove (11) and/or 

the wall faces of the clamping strips (12) associated 
with them are provided with continuous grooving or 

fluting in the longitudinal direction.  

 
Lining lid according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the lining frame (9) is made up of 

four extruded profile portions (13, 14) of equal lengths 
in pairs and of four 90Â°-corner connecting pieces (15). 
Lining lid according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the extruded profile forming the lining frame (9) is a 

hollow chamber profile, into the hollow chambers (16, 
17) of which plug connectors (18, 19) engage when the 

lining frame (9) is assembled together. 
Lining lid according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the flexible, air-permeable areal 

material (10) is a textile fabric or a perforated 
plastic sheet. 
Lining lid according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the upper face of the flexible, 

air-permeable areal material (10) is coated to make it 
thermally insulating and reflective of the sun's rays. 
Lining lid according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the lower face of the flexible, 

air-permeable material (10) is adapted in its structure 
and/or colouring to the internal equipment of the 

automobile.
