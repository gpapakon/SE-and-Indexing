<ABSTRACT>
A reproducing apparatus for a disc-shaped recording medium (1) having digital 
audio signals recorded in a compressed form includes an optical head (2), a spindle 

motor (3), a servo control unit (20), a decoder (24), a memory (24) and a controller 
(21). The optical head (2) radiates a light beam on the disc-shaped recording medium 

(1) for reading out data recorded on the disc-shaped recording medium (1). The spindle 
motor (3) rotationally drives the disc-shaped recording medium (1) at a constant linear 

velocity. The servo control unit (20) servo-controls the optical head (2) and the spindle 
motor (3) based upon error signals generated on the basis of output signal of the optical 

head (2). The decoder decodes (24) output signals of the optical head (2). The 
memory (25) transiently stores output data of the decoder (24) and the data stored in the 

memory (25) is read out at a readout rate slower than the write rate of the data 
outputted from the decoder (24). The controller (21) controls the optical head (2) and 

the memory (25) so that, by alternately setting a first period during which data recorded 
on the disc-shaped recording medium (1) is read out by the optical head (2) and written 

in the memory (25) a second period during which readout of data recorded on the disc-shaped 
recording medium (1) by the optical head is discontinued and only readout of 

the data stored in the memory (25) is made, the data recorded on the disc-shaped 
recording medium (1) is read out intermittently. The controller (20) discontinues the 

operation of the servo control unit during the second period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reproducing apparatus for
a disc-shaped recording medium. More particularly, the present
invention relates to such reproducing apparatus in which data is
intermittently read out from the disc-shaped recording medium.The present Assignee has proposed a technique in which input
digital audio signals are bit-compressed and recorded in a burst
fashion with a pre-set data quantity as a recording unit.This technique records/reproduces adaptive differential (AD)
PCM digital audio data, as prescribed in an audio data format, such
as a so-called CD-interactive (CD-I) or CD-ROM, or digital audio
data in accordance with other formats, on or from a magneto-optical
disc employed as a recording medium. The compressed digital audio
data is recorded intermittently sector- continuously, with a preset
amount of data as a recording unit, for example, at an interval of
32 sectors/minute, by appending linking sectors before and after
each recording unit in order to take the interleaving with data of
the neighboring sectors into account. It is now assumed that data of the standard compact disc
format (CD-DA format) or straight PCM audio data produced by simple
linear quantization of analog audio signals are recorded or
reproduced with bit compression to approximately one-fourth of the
original data length.The playback time of data recorded on the disc by compressing
the bits to approximately one-fourth of the original data length
is approximately four times of that when recording the straight PCM
data before compression, for example, data of the CD-DA format.
Since the recording/playback time substantially equal to that for
a standard CD with a diameter of 12 cm may be recorded on or
reproduced from a disc of a smaller size, the reproducing apparatus
may be correspondingly reduced in size. By setting the
instantaneous bit rate for recording/ reproduction so as to be
equal to that of the standard CD-DA format, the actual time
consumed in recording/reproduction may be reduced to one-fourth,
as a result of which the residual time amounting to approximately
three-fourths may be apportioned to retry or the like operations.
These operations include verification operations as to if the
recording has been made as normally or re-write operation if
recording has not been made as normally, during data recording, and
re-read operations in case of the high error rate of the playback
data during data reproduction.In addition, during the reproduction, by using special
techniques in data readout from the
