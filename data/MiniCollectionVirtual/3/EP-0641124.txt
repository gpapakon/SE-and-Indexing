<ABSTRACT>
A digital video signal coding circuit has a first 
DCT circuit for converting a digital video signal framewise 

and second DCT circuit for converting 
the signal fieldwise 

to reduce high frequency components of the image. The 
outputs are selected according to the high frequency components. 

The selected signal is separated into two signals and variable length 
coded. A helical scan video 

tape recorder records the coded signal such that at the 
lower portion of the slant track of the 

tape, video data of the upper screen area of the first field 
are recorded; at the upper portion of the track, video data of 

the upper screen area of the second field are recorded; 
at the lower portion of the next slant track, video data of the 

lower screen area of the first field are recorded; at the 
upper 
portion, video data of the lower screen area of the 
second field are recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a digital video signal 
coding circuit for coding a digital video signal with data 
compression, a decoding circuit for decoding a digital 
video signal coded by the digital video signal coding 
circuit, and a helical scan video tape recorder including 
these circuits. A digital coding circuit for coding a digital video 
signal with data compression used in a digital VTR is known. 
This digital coding circuit codes the digital video signal 
through a quadrature conversion circuit, a variable length 
coding circuit, an error correction coding circuit, and a 
record coding circuit in order to record the digital video 
signal on a recording medium, such as a magnetic tape. A 
digital decoding circuit decoding a reproduced digital 
video signal reproduced from the recording medium, on which 
the digital video signal has been recorded as mentioned 
above, through a data detection circuit, an error 
correction circuit, a variable length decoding circuit, and  
 
a quadrature inverse conversion circuit. Generally, in the case of non-industrial use digital 
VTRs or home use digital VTRs, because the number of 
manufactured apparatus is larger than that of the 
industrial use digital VTRs, the development and 
manufacturing costs of ICs used in the non-industrial use 
digital VTR is low. Contrary, because the number of 
manufactured high picture quality digital VTRs is extremely 
small generally, the development and manufacturing costs of 
ICs per set tends to be high. Therefore, there is such an idea that a cost of a 
high picture quality digital VTR can be reduced by using 
common signal processing ICs between non-industrial use 
digital VTRs and high picture quality digital VTRs. In the non-industrial use digital VTR or home use 
digital VTR, a cassette size (tape length) should be 
determined in consideration of not only picture quality but 
a recording duration and easiness in handling of the 
cassette. Generally, there is a tendency that a small 
cassette size is preferred, which is provided by making a 
coding compression rate large to the extent of 1/4 to 
1/tens. On the other hand, in the high picture quality 
digital VTR, because the picture quality is important, a 
relatively small coding compression rate such as 1/2 to 1/4 
is selected.  Here, "small coding compression" means that an 
amount of data recorded/reproduced on/from a video tape is 
large. In other words, an amount of data per unit interval 
which a signal processing circuit of a high picture quality 
digital VTR
