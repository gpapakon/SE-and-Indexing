<ABSTRACT>
A reclosable zipper (10) for a reclosable bag comprises a 
first closure (14) having a first base (24), a first pair of locking 

members (26) integrally connected to the first base (24), and a center 
guide post (30) integrally connected to the first base (24). The center 

guide post (30) is positioned adjacent to and between the first 
pair of locking members (26). The zipper (10) further comprises a 

second closure (12) having a second base (16), a second pair of locking 
members (18) integrally connected to the second base (16) , and a pair of 

outer guide posts (20) integrally connected to the second base (16). 
The second pair of locking members (18) are positioned adjacent to 

and between the pair of outer guide posts (22). The second closure (12) 
is disposed adjacent and opposite to the first closure (14), and 

the second closure (12) is constructed and arranged to interlock 
with the first closure (14) over a predetermined length by 

engagement of the second pair of locking members (18) with the 
first pair of locking members (26). The second pair of locking 

members (18) and the pair of outer guide posts (22) have transverse 
notches formed therein at intermittent locations along the 

predetermined length. The notches enhance the ease of locking 
the zipper and provide positive tactile feedback indicative of 

effective locking of the zipper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to reclosable
zippers and, more particularly, is concerned with a reclosable
zipper having transverse notches in either the male or female
closure.Many consumer packaging applications employ reclosable
bags. These bags employ reclosable zippers for locking
products within the bags. A typical reclosable zipper
includes male and female closures extending along the entire
length of the zipper. The female closure is disposed opposite
to the male closure and is adapted to mate with the male
closure. Each of the closures includes one or more locking
members with locking tips. The closures are interlocked by
properly aligning the male and female closures and pressing
the closures together along the entire length of the zipper so
that the locking tips engage with one another.In some applications, it is preferable to increase the
"holding" or "lock" strength of the reclosable zipper to
insure that the zipper will not accidently reopen, releasing
the contents of the bag. To increase lock strength, existing
reclosable zippers employ stiffer materials or different
configurations for designing the locking members of the zipper
closures. Stiffer materials increase lock strength because 
such materials do not "give" as easily as more flexible
materials, thereby making it more difficult to disengage
interlocked locking members. Similarly, locking members may
be configured to provide a stronger engagement between mated
locking members.A drawback of existing reclosable zippers is that by
increasing lock strength, the ability to lock and relock the
zipper is made more difficult. This makes the reclosable
zipper less consumer friendly. Another drawback of existing
reclosable zippers is that, in addition to a physical check of
the zipper, a person generally must make a visual inspection
of the zipper following engagement of the closures for
assurance of effective locking of the zipper. Consequently, a
need exists for a reclosable zipper which overcomes the
foregoing drawbacks associated with existing reclosable
zippers. US-A- 5007146, according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1, discloses a reclosable
zipper comprising a pair of closures which are disposed opposite to one another. Said
pair of closures is configured to interlock with one another over a predetermined length.
One of said pair of closures includes a base and a locking member which is integrally
connected to said base. One of said pair of closures has transverse notches having a
top, a bottom and a pair of sides

<CLAIMS>
A reclosable zipper (10) comprising:

a pair of closures (12,14) disposed adjacent and opposite to one another, said pair
of closures (12,14) being configured to interlock with one another over a

predetermined length, wherein said one (12) of said pair of closures (12,14)
includes a base (16) and a locking member (18) integrally connected to said base

(16) and having a tip (20), and wherein said one (12) of said pair of closures (12,14)
has transverse notches (32) having a top, a bottom and a pair of sides formed

therein at intermittent locations along said predetermined length,
characterized in that
said notches (32) divide said one (12) of said pair of closures (12,14) into
deflectable segments so as to enhance the ease of interlocking said pair of

closures (12,14), wherein one (12) of said pair of closures (12,14) includes a guide
post (22) integrally connected to said base (16), said guide post (22) being

positioned adjacent to said locking member (18), and wherein said notches (32) are
formed in said locking member (18) and said guide post (22) at intermittent

locations along the length of said locking member and said guide post (22).
The reclosable zipper of claim 1, wherein said notches (32) in said locking member
(18) and said notches (32) in said guide post (22) are transversely aligned relative

to one another.
The reclosable zipper of claim 1 wherein said notches (32) have a trapezoidal
shape such that the top (38) of said notches (32) is wider than the bottom (40) of

said notches. 
The reclosable zipper of claim 1, wherein said notches (32) have a generally
rectangular shape such that the tops (38a) of said notches (32) have substantially

the same width as the bottom (40a) if said notches (32).
The reclosable zipper claim 1, wherein said notches (32) extend from the tip (36) of
said locking member (18) to a depth spaced slightly away from said base (16).
The reclosable zipper of claim 1, wherein said notches (32) are narrow relative to
the longitudinal distance between said notches (32).
The reclosable zipper of claim 1, wherein the other (14) of said pair of closures
(12,14) includes transverse notches (52) formed therein at intermittent locations

along said predetermined length.

pair of closures (12,14) are offset relative to said notches (52) in said other (14) of

said pair of closures (12,14).
The reclosable zipper of claim 1, wherein the other (14) of the pair of closures
(12,14) includes a base (24), a pair of locking members (26) integrally connected to

said base (24) and having tips (28), and a center guide post (30) integrally
connected to said base (24), said center guide post (30) being positioned adjacent

to and between said pair of locking members (26).
The reclosable zipper of claim 9, wherein the one (12) of the pair of closures
(12,14) includes a pair of locking members (18) and a pair of outer guide posts (22),
