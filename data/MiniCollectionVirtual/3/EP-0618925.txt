<ABSTRACT>
Oligonucleotides and other macromolecules are provided that have increased nuclease resistance, substituent groups for increasing binding affinity to complementary strand, and subsequences of 2'-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotides that activate RNase H enzyme. Such oligonucleotides and macromolecules are useful for diagnostics and other research purposes, for modulating protein in organisms, and for the diagnosis, detection and treatment of other conditions susceptible to antisense therapeutics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the synthesis and use
of oligonucleotides to elicit RNase H for
strand cleavage in an opposing strand. Included in the
invention are oligonucleotides wherein at least some of the
nucleotides of the oligonucleotides are functionalized to be
nuclease resistant, at least some of the nucleotides of the
oligonucleotide include a substituent that potentiates
hybridization of the oligonucleotide to a complementary strand,
and at least some of the nucleotides of the oligonucleotide
include 2'-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl sugar moieties. The
oligonucleotides are useful for therapeutics,
diagnostics and as research reagents.It is well known that most of the bodily states in
mammals including most disease states, are effected by
proteins. Such proteins, either acting directly or through
their enzymatic functions, contribute in major proportion to
many diseases in animals and man. Classical therapeutics has
generally focused upon interactions with such proteins in an
effort to moderate their disease causing or disease
potentiating functions. Recently, however, attempts have been
made to moderate the actual production of such proteins by
interactions with messenger RNA (mRNA) or other intracellular
RNA's that direct protein synthesis. It is generally the
object of such therapeutic approaches to interfere with or
otherwise modulate gene expression leading to undesired protein 
formation.Antisense methodology is the complementary hybridization
of relatively short oligonucleotides to single-stranded
RNA or single-stranded DNA such that the normal, essential
functions of these intracellular nucleic acids are disrupted.
Hybridization is the sequence specific hydrogen bonding via
Watson-Crick base pairs of the heterocyclic bases of oligonucleotides
to RNA or DNA. Such base pairs are said to be
complementary to one another.Naturally occurring events that provide for the
disruption of the nucleic acid function, as discussed by Cohen
in Oligonucleotides: Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression,
CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, F1 (1989) are thought to be of two
types. The first is hybridization arrest. This denotes the
terminating event in which an oligonucleotide inhibitor binds
to target nucleic acid and thus prevents, by simple steric
hindrance, the binding of essential proteins, most often
ribosomes, to the nucleic acid. Methyl phosphonate
oligonucleotides (see, e.g., Miller, et al., Anti-Cancer Drug
Design1987,2, 117) and α-anomer oligonucleotides are the two
most extensively studied antisense
