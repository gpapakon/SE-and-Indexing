<ABSTRACT>
The integral closure designed according to the invention is self-closing and can be produced in an extremely economical manner. Opening of the closure is brought about by pressure on the flexible wall of a flange. A closure cap 2 with an associated sealing ring 4 is arranged on the neck of a bottle 1. The sealing ring 4 is provided with an outer, circumferential sealing lip 6 in the form of a projecting circular ring. A reinforcing plate 5 is assigned a transverse web 3, both parts being surrounded by a softer material, the softer material being injection-moulded onto the reinforcing plate 5 by the two-component injection method. An accumulation of material 9 is injection-moulded onto the underside of the reinforcing plate. The end-side boundary of the reinforcing plate 5 is provided with a lid 12 which can be clipped onto the outer wall of the sealing ring 4.

Self-closing closure for containers intended for the reception of pasty or viscous 
masses, especially tubes, with a closure body arranged in the opening region of the 

container (1) to be resiliently movable, wherein a freeing of the opening can be produced 
by a pressure exerted by way of the material in the container on the closure body against a 

resilient elastic force, characterised by a transverse web (3), which is mounted in the 
opening region of the container (1), with a reinforcing plate (5) connected to the web 

pivotably at the longitudinal side, which are enclosed in common by a softer, elastic 
material. 
Closure according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the softer material (10) is 
injection-moulded on the reinforcing plate (5) in the two-component injection moulding 

process. 
Closure according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the transverse web 
(3) extends under the reinforcing plate (5). 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that the reinforcing 
plate (5) has at least two passage openings (8), which are arranged laterally of the 

transverse web (3). 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that a material 
accumulation (9) is injection-moulded on the underside of the reinforcing plate (5). 
Closure according to claim 5, characterised thereby that the transition from the 
material accumulation (9) to the remaining injection-moulded softer material (10) has a 

curved boundary. 
Closure according to claim 5 or 6, characterised thereby that the material 
accumulation (9) seen in the underneath view extends perpendicularly to the transverse 

web (3) and has a rectangular shape. 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby that the reinforcing 
plate (5) has at least one retaining rib (11) arranged at the circumference.  

 
Closure according to claim 8, characterised thereby that the retaining rib (11) is 
formed as a part-circular ring. 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised thereby that the injection-moulded 
softer material (10) is formed at the outer boundary of the reinforcing plate (5) as 

a closure seal. 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised thereby that the 
reinforcing plate (5) is connected to the transverse web (3) by way of a film hinge (7). 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised thereby that the 
reinforcing plate (5) is directly injection moulded at a closure cap (2) of the container (1). 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised thereby that the 
reinforcing plate (5) is mounted in a sealing ring (4). 
Closure according to claim 13, characterised thereby that the sealing ring (4) is 
provided on its outer side with an encircling sealing lip (6). 
Closure according to claim 14, characterised thereby that the sealing ring (4) is 
fixedly arranged by way of its sealing lip (6) at the neck of the container (1) or at a closure 

cap (2). 
Closure according to claim 15, characterised thereby that the sealing ring (4) and 
the closure cap (2) are produced integrally. 
Closure according to one of claims 13 to 16, characterised thereby that a retaining 
rib, which is associated with a corresponding recess in the reinforcing plate (5), is 

injection-moulded on a part of the inner side of the sealing ring (4). 
Closure according to claim 17, characterised thereby that the retaining rib of the 
sealing ring (4) is formed as a part-circular ring.
