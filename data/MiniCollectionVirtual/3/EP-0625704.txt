<ABSTRACT>
A planar, electrochemical sensor having a substrate, conductive strips deposited on the 
substrate, and a dielectric layer insulating portions of the conductive strips except those 

portions which define a working electrode and at least one second electrode. The working 
electrode may be defined by an open printed region of the dielectric, or by a needle-punched 

or laser-burned hole or opening in the dielectric which exposes a small region of one of the 
conductive strips. A solid electrolyte contacting the electrodes is covered by a semipermeable 

membrane which may comprise an acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer or an acrylate-based 
copolymer. A sample chamber is defined by the membrane, a cover member, and a gasket 

therebetween, and has a volume of from about 1 to about 2 ml. The gasket is formulated from 
the highly cross-linked polymerization product of epichlorohydrin. All sensor components are 

selected such that a sensor operable for at least 2 days under normal conditions is produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to planar sensors, and more specifically to a
planar electrochemical oxygen sensor that is small, is non-oxygen-depleting, is convenient and
inexpensive to manufacture, and has a fast response time and has a long useful life.In the clinical setting, it is important to monitor certain blood analytes which are
significant to normal physiological function and homeostasis. Such blood analytes include
pCO2, pO2, tHb, pH, Na+, K+, Cl- and Ca2+. The focus of the present invention is to sensors
for the measurement of pO2, i.e., the partial pressure of oxygen. The teaching of the present
invention further extends to sensors for measuring other blood analytes and to sensors for use
in other technical fields. Conventional approaches for doing so utilize a variety of
electrochemical means such as two or three-electrode electrochemical sensors having liquid,
solid, or gel electrolytes.Conventional sensors are fabricated to be large, comprising many serviceable parts, or
to be small, planar-type sensors which may be more convenient in many circumstances. The
term "planar" as used herein refers to the well-known procedure of fabricating a substantially
planar structure comprising layers of relatively thin materials, for example using the well known
thick-film or thin-film techniques. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,571,292 and EP-A-125807.The electrodes of such a sensor are conventionally addressed by an electrolyte covered
by a gas permeable but liquid impermeable membrane such as teflon, polyethylene or
polypropylene. As blood is placed in contact with the membrane, oxygen from the blood
diffuses across the membrane, through the electrolyte solution, and is reduced at a cathode.
The oxygen partial pressure of the sample is determined by measuring the resultant electrical
current flowing through a circuit including the cathode and an anode. A three-electrode sensor
may be employed, which maintains a constant voltage relationship between a working
electrode (cathode) and a reference electrode by a feedback control, and is described in U.S.
Patent No. 4,571,292, referenced above. According to such a system, oxygen may be
reduced at the working cathode, this reaction driven by the constant potential between the
working and reference electrodes such that a reaction taking place at a counter electrode 
(anode) is simply the reverse of that occurring at the working cathode, that is, a
non-electrode-consuming reaction.With regard to both two and three-electrode sensors, it is
