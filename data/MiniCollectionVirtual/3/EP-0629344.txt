<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of dimethyl substituted
oxymethyl cyclohexane derivatives defined according to the
structure:

and geraldehyde having the structure:

(wherein Z is methylene; n is 0 or 1; each of the wavy lines
represents a carbon-carbon single bond or no bond (when n is
0); the dashed line represents a carbon-carbon double bond or a
carbon-carbon single bond; each of R2, R5, R6, R7 and 
R8 represent hydrogen or methyl; and R1 is hydrogen acetyl
or ethoxycarbonyl as insect repellents against house flies
(MuscadomesticaL.(Diptera:Muscidae)), mosquitoes including
those set forth on the following species list:
Culexnigripalpus;Aedesatlanticus;Culexsalinarius;Aedesvexans;Culexspp.;Simuliumspp.;Psoroferiaferox;Aedesinfirmatus;Drosophilamelanogaster;Coccinellidae;Anophelescrucians;Psoroferiacolumbiae;Culicoidesspp.; andAedesspp.
and the Horn fly, Haematobiairritans [L.].Disclosed herein is the use of the compound
having the structure:
 
as an attractant for the insect species:
Culexnigripalpus;Aedesatlanticus;Culexsalinarius;Aedesvexans;Culexspp.;Simuliumspp.;Psoroferiaferox;Aedesinfirmatus;Drosophilamelanogaster;Coccinellidae;Anophelescrucians;Psoroferiacolumbiae;Culicoidesspp.; andAedesspp..Specific examples of the dimethyl substituted oxymethyl
cyclohexane derivatives useful in the practice of our invention
are those having the following structures:
Also disclosed herein are dimethyl substituted oxymethyl cyclohexane
derivatives having the following structures;
