<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermosetting
epoxy resin compositions which are rendered flame
retardant by having combined therewith an effective
amount of specific dihydroxymethyl phosphine oxides.Epoxy resins and their utility are well known
and have been described in numerous publications. Just
as well known is the propensity of these resins to burn.
To improve their flame retardant characteristics, epoxy
resins have been compounded with phosphate and
phosphonate esters including those containing haloalkyl
groups as described in British Patent No. 1,487,609;
U.S. Patent No. 3,192,242 and South African Patent No.
18201/77. The use of triphenylphosphine as a flame
retardant additive for epoxy resins was described by
Martin and Price, J. Applied Polymer Science, 12,
143-158 (1968).Tetrakishydroxymethylphosphonium chloride and
trishydroxymethylphosphine oxide have also been used in
epoxy resins as described in U.S. Patent No. 2,916,473.
Aminoalkylphosphonic acid esters are suggested as fire
retardant hardeners for epoxy resins in U.S. Patent No.
4,151,229.U.S. Patent Nos. 3,666,543 and 3,716,580
disclose 2-hydroxyalkylphosphine oxides and halogenated
derivatives thereof that are said to have utility as
flame proofing agents.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,345,059; 4,380,571 and
4,440,944 all disclose fire retardant epoxy resin
compositions which contain 3-hydroxyalkylphosphine
oxides to impart said fire retardant characteristics. Addition of halogenated organic compounds
alone to epoxy resins for imparting flame retardancy is
well known and widely practiced. The most widely used
method is to add a brominated bis-phenol acetone or a
bis-epoxide adduct thereof to the resin. However, these
brominated resins, when used alone, require bromine
contents of up to 20% or even higher to be effective.
These large organobromine levels increase the density of
the resin, generate large amounts of smoke containing
corrosive materials such as hydrogen bromide gas, and
may lead to generation of highly toxic materials such as
polybrominated dibenzodioxins. Formulations which
reduce the bromine content required for flame retardancy
would thus have significant value.However, phosphorus based known flame
retardant additives for use in epoxy resin compositions
generally suffer from one or more deficiencies including
low compatibility with the resin, low thermal stability
or poor fire retardant behavior. Some fire retardant
additives also negatively impact the glass transition
temperature of the resin to an unacceptable extent.The
