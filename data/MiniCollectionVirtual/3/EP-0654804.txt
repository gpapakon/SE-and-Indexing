<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid
electrolytic capacitor and, more particularly, to a
solid electrolytic capacitor using a conductive polymer
compound as a solid electrolyte and to a method of making such a capacitor.A tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor is
generally constituted by an anode obtained by sintering
a tantalum powder, a tantalum oxide coating serving as a
dielectric formed on the anode, a solid electrolyte
formed on the oxide coating, and a cathode conductor
formed on the solid electrolyte.A conventional capacitor using manganese
dioxide as a solid electrolyte is well known. In recent
years, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication No. 4-56445 (Reference 1) or in EP-A-0 135 223, a capacitor using
a conductive polymer compound such as polypyrrole in
place of manganese dioxide is also proposed. Note that,
as cathode conductors, a graphite layer and a silver
layer are often used.A capacitor using a conductive polymer
compound as a solid electrolyte has excellent
characteristics in a high-frequency range compared with
that of a capacitor using manganese dioxide because the 
conductivity of the conductive polymer compound is
several tens times that of manganese dioxide. A
capacitor using the conductive polymer compound has
received a good deal of attention as a capacitor which
copes with an increase in operating frequency of
electronic equipment in recent years. Since manganese
dioxide is produced by thermally decomposing manganese
nitrate, thermal stress at about 200 to 300°C repeatedly
acts on a capacitor element, and defects occur in an
oxide coating, thereby disadvantageously increasing a
leakage current. In contrast to this, when a conductive
polymer compound is used as a solid electrolyte, it is
known that a highly reliable product which is free from
degradation of an oxide coating can be provided because
a capacitor element need not be treated at a high
temperature (e.g., Reference 1). As types of conductive
polymer compounds, polypyrrole, a derivative thereof
(Reference 1 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 64-4912
(Reference 2)), and a five-membered heterocyclic
copolymer or a mixture of polypyrrole, polythiophene,
and a derivative thereof as disclosed in, e.g., Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 2-98915 (Reference 3) are used.Although a solid electrolytic capacitor using
a conductive polymer compound has excellent
high-frequency characteristics compared with a tantalum
solid electrolytic capacitor using only manganese
dioxide as a solid electrolyte, the solid
