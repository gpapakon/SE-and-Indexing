<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a push button switch which comprises rubber contacts each 
including a contact portion (311), a flared portion (312) formed integrally with the 

periphery of the contact portion (311), and a ring-shaped portion (313) formed 
integrally with a lower end of the flared portion (312) and disposed on a printed 

board (1) wherein the following relation is satisfied: 

0.3 ≦ d / a ≦ 0.7, 4 ≦ d / t 
≦ 6, 1.0 ≦ d / h ≦ 1.4, 150° ≦ ϑ ≦ 165°, 1.5 ≦ h ≦ 3 
 
 where t is the thickness of 

the flared portion (312), d is the length of the flared portion (312), a is an inner 
diameter of the ring-shaped portion (313), ϑ is an opening angle formed by an 

inner side surface of the flared portion (312) and a top surface of the printed board 
(1), and h is the distance between a bottom surface of a conductor (32) and the top 

surface of the printed board (1). Only the rubber contacts provide a sufficient 
operational load and a clear click feeling required for a vehicle-mounted switch 

without using the conventional spring and sliding element. This accomplishes an 
inexpensive, small-sized vehicle-mounted push button switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automotive power window push button
switch according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a switch
is described for example in EP-A-0 235 880.In the past, rubber contacts for push button switches have offered the
advantages of providing a stabilized switching condition as compared with
mechanical type contacts, being excellent in chattering characteristic, and being
inexpensive, and thus have been used in various applications including VTRs, audio
equipments, wireless equipments, copiers, telephones and the like.However, a small number of rubber contacts have been used in vehicle-mounted
push button switches for the reason that an operating feeling required for
the vehicle-mounted push button switches is not provided, that is, the following
requirements are not met: (i) a high load and a long stroke for prevention of
malfunction; and (ii) a high load, a long stroke, and a clear click feeling enough for
an operator to recognize switching.To attain such an operating feeling, the use of a spring and the like in
combination with the rubber contacts has conventionally been considered as shown
in Fig. 3.Referring to Fig. 3, two insulative rubber contacts 2a and 2b are arranged 
laterally in position on a printed board 1 on which a copper foil pattern is formed
and various electronic parts are mounted. A case 3 includes left and right bosses
4a and 4b of tubular configuration in positions corresponding respectively to the
rubber contacts 2a and 2b. The case 3 is disposed on the printed board 1 so that
the rubber contacts 2a and 2b are positioned within the bosses 4a and 4b,
respectively. Columnar pushing plates 5 having an outer diameter substantially
equal to or slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the bosses 4a, 4b are
disposed on the rubber contacts 2a and 2b, respectively, with their top portions
exposed outside the left and right bosses 4a and 4b.Each of the rubber contacts 2a and 2b includes a disc-shaped contact portion
21 in contact with the corresponding pushing plate 5, a flared portion 22 formed
integrally with an upper periphery of the contact portion 21, and a ring-shaped
portion 23 formed integrally with a lower end of the flared portion 22, as shown
in Fig. 3. Lower ends of the bosses 4a, 4b are pressed against the ring-shaped
portions 23 to fix the rubber contacts 2a and 2b in the bosses 4a, 4b without
position shift, respectively.As illustrated in Fig. 3, a tubular boss 7 is integrally formed in an intermediate
position between the bosses 4a and 4b on an

<CLAIMS>
An automotive power window push button switch comprising:

a case (33) in which a printed board (1) is disposed;
a key top (39) to be pressed, said key top (39) being
mounted on said case (33) for rotation about a support

shaft (40);
two tubular bosses (34a, 34b) formed in said case
(33); and
two rubber contacts (31a, 31b) housed respectively in
said bosses (34a, 34b) and each deformed on receipt of

pressure upon said key top (39) through a pushing plate
37a, 37b) for closing a switch contact formed on said

printed board (1),

   each of said rubber contacts (31a, 31b) including:

a contact portion (311) having a top surface contacting
said pushing plate; and
a bottom surface to which a conductor (32) for closing
said switch contact is applied;
a flared portion (312) formed integrally with the periphery
of said contact portion (311); and
a ring-shaped portion (313) formed integrally with a
lower end of said flared portion (312) and disposed on said

printed board (1),

   characterised in that
the following relations are satisfied:


0.3 ≤ d/a ≤ 0.7,
4 ≤ d/t ≤ 6,
1.0 ≤ d/h ≤ 1.4,
150° ≤  ≤ 165°, and
1.5 ≤ h ≤ 3,

   where

t is the thickness of said flared portion (312),
d is the length of said flared portion (312), 
a is an inner diameter of said ring-shaped portion
(31
3),
 is an opening angle formed by an inner side surface
of said flared portion (312) and a line normal to a top

surface of said printed board (1), and
h is the distance between a bottom surface of said
conductor and the top surface of said printed board (1).
