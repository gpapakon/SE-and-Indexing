<ABSTRACT>
A multilayered medical film mainly used for forming a double-compartment medical container and excellent in 
heat resistance, transparency, flexibility, impact resistance, and easiness in peeling and sealing, which film is composed 

of: an inner layer formed from a resin mixture composed of an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.930-0.945 
g/cm³ and polypropylene, an intermediate layer containing at least one mixed resin layer formed from a resin 

mixture, in a ratio of 1:5 to 2:1 by weight, of an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.920-0.945 g/cm³ 
and an ethylene/α-olefin elastomer having a density of 0.880-0.890 g/cm³, wherein the mixed resin layer accounts 

for at least 85 % of the whole intermediate layer in thickness, and an outer layer formed from an ethylene/α-olefin 
copolymer having a density of 0.930-0.945 g/cm³.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical 
multilayer films which are excellent in heat resistance, 
transparency, flexibility, impact resistance, easily 
peelable sealing properties, etc. and to medical 
containers formed of said films and having a plurality of 
chambers. Such medical containers have a plurality of 
chambers for individually accommodating unstable medical 
preparations (liquid, powdery or solid preparations) 
which are likely to change with time when mixed together, 
and a weak seal portion (easily peelable seal portion) 
separating the chambers and easily openable when desired 
by peeling to mix the medical contents of the chambers. The term "easily peelable sealing properties" 
as used herein refers to such properties of a film that 
the film is capable of selectively forming a strong seal 
portion which is substantially not openable by peeling or 
a weak seal portion (hereinafter referred to as the 
"easily peelable seal portion") which is easily openable 
by peeling, one of the seal portions being formable by 
altering the fusing temperature for heat sealing.  
 Films for medical containers are generally 
formed by polyethylene or polypropylene which has high 
chemical stability to acids, alkalis, salts, etc. Also 
known as films for use in forming such medical containers 
having a plurality of chambers are single-layer or 
two-layer films having a resin layer which is prepared 
from a molten mixture of alpha-polyolefin resins, such as 
polyethylene and polypropylene, which are different in 
compatibility. For example, 
JP-A- 4671/1990 discloses a single-layer film 
of resin mixture of two components, i.e., a linear 
low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, or a 
single-layer film of resin mixture of three components, 
i.e., a linear low-density polyethylene, polypropylene 
and ethylene-propylene copolymer. A two-layer film is 
also disclosed which comprises an outer layer of linear 
low-density polyethylene, and an inner layer of resin 
mixture of linear low-density polyethylene and 
polypropylene. In the resin mixtures mentioned, 
polypropylene has the highest melting point and is used 
mainly to ensure easily peelable sealing properties. However, the single-layer film of two-component 
resin mixture contains in the single-layer forming resin  
 
a large amount of polypropylene which is lower than 
polyethylene in transparency, flexibility and impact 
resistance, so that the container prepared from this film 
is low in usefulness in respect of transparency, 
flexibility and
