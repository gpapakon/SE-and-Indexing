<ABSTRACT>
Quick joint for rapid, tight-seal connection of 
pipes, in which from the end (4''') of the female hollow body (4) 

an internal flaring (4'') with decreasing cross-section 
extends, suitable for getting engaged, with 

interference, with a corresponding external counter-flaring (1'') 
provided on the male hollow body (1) in the neary 

of the overhanging shoulder (3) of the latter which, on 
its one side, cooperates with the sleeve (8) of the joint 

and, on its other side, cooperates with said end (4''') of 
said female hollow body (4); from the end (1''') of said male 

hollow body (4) furthermore a second external flaring (9,11) with 
decreasing cross-section extends, suitable for getting 

engaged, with interference, with a counter-flaring (10,12) 
provided inside the interior of said female hollow 

body (4) in the nearby of an internal shoulder (6) for said 
male body (1). 
Also preferred embodiments are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a joint which, 
by realizing two metal seals with interference 
engagement activated by a screwable sleeve, makes it 
possible an easy, effective and cheap rapid, tight-seal 
connection of two pipes with each other to be 
accomplished with no need for said two pipes to be 
submitted to a revolutionary movement. As known, in petroleum field and in particular in 
the operations for well completion, the need exists 
for connecting the production tubing with the so said 
tubing hanger at the wellhead. In the case of a single 
completion, said connection is made by simply screwing 
the single tubing onto the tubing hanger, a solution 
which is anyway impossible in the case of multiple 
completions, i.e., in the presence of two or more 
tubings to be connected, but using the expensive and 
complex through-adapter tubing hangers. In order to obviate the above drawback, joints 
have been developed which make it possible the tubings 
to be connected with said tubing hanger, with no need 
for said tubings to be submitted to a revolutionary 
movement, see for example, GB-A-1 085 288. The joints known from the prior art substantially 
comprise a female hollow body to be butt-fastened to a 
tubing section, a male hollow body cooperating with 
said female body and to be fastened onto said tubing 
hanger, a first sleeve suitable for being screwed onto 
said male body in order to cause the elastomeric-elements  
 
seal provided between said bodies to become 
operating, as well as a second sleeve suitable for 
being screwed down onto said female body in order to 
ensure the mechanical continuity. Unfortunately, such a kind of joint, besides a 
certain mechanical complexity, requires the use of two 
sleeves; and it does not ensure, with its elastomeric 
elements, an effective tightness of the sealing over 
time, in particular under such hostile operating 
conditions as generally met in petroleum field. In order to accomplish a better seal tightness, 
in certain joints known from the prior art, a gasket 
was adopted which is constituted by a low-yield metal 
ring, but also this solution does not offer a high 
enough reliability, as required in the concerned 
field. The purpose of the present invention is precisely 
of obviating the above said drawbacks and therefore 
supplying a joint which, besides making it possible 
pipes to be rapidly connected, also ensures that an 
effective and reliable tight-seal will be achieved 
also under extremely hostile operating conditions, 
i.e., under

<CLAIMS>
Joint for rapid, tight-seal connection of 
pipes, comprising a female hollow body (4) to be buttfastened 

onto a pipe, a male hollow body (1) to be butt-fastened 
to a second pipe and cooperating with said 

female body, and a sleeve (8) suitable for being 
screwed onto an external thread (7) on said female body, wherein 

said male hollow body is 
provided with an external shoulder (3) 

integral with said body, which shoulder cooperates, on 
one of its sides, with said sleeve and, on its other 

side, with the end of said female hollow body, from 
which an internal, decreasing-cross section flaring (9) 

extends, which is suitable for interference engagement, 
with a corresponding external 

counter-flaring (10) provided on said male hollow body adjacent 
said shoulder, from the end 

of said male hollow body a second decreasing-cross 
section flaring (11) extending which is suitable for 

interference engagement with a 
corresponding counter-flaring (12) provided in the 

interior of said female body, adjacent an 
internal shoulder (6) in said female body against which the end of the male body abuts. 
Joint for rapid, tight-seal connection of 
pipes according to claim 1, characterized in that said 

flarings and corresponding counter-flarings have a 
cone frustum shape. 
Joint for rapid, tight-seal connection of 
pipes according to claim 1, characterized in that said 

flarings have a spherical-surface bulging and get into  
 

interference engagement with respective counter-flarings 
of cone frustum shape. 
Joint for rapid, tight-seal connection of 
pipes according to claim 1, characterized in that the 

terminal end of said male hollow body of the joint, 
comprised between said external shoulder 

and its end, is tapered towards said end thereof, 
correspondingly to the terminal portion of the female 

body of said joint.
