<ABSTRACT>
Part of the random-access memory (4) of a digital signal processor (1), customarily termed DSP, is used to place therein a software layer (6) which plays the role of a management and control unit which reads instructions (10) from a memory (5), possibly of large size, outside the DSP, and manages the transfer thereof, instruction by instruction or at least instruction block by instruction block, to the program memory (4) of the DSP. Applications: real-time digital computations, especially within hardware for the general public, such as datacom terminals.

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a digital signal processor having a sequencer and an
instruction interpreter adapted to bring about the execution of instructions stored in a

program memory of the digital signal processor, said processor being further associated
with an external memory containing instructions to be executed, characterized in that

software means for transferring instructions from the external memory to the actual
program memory of the digital signal processor are loaded into said program memory.
A device comprising a digital signal processor having a program memory in
which instructions are stored, as well as a sequencer and an instruction interpreter adapted

to bring about the execution of said instructions, the device further comprising a memory
external to the digital signal processor and containing instructions, said device being

characterized in that it comprises means for transferring instructions from the external
memory to the actual program memory of the digital signal processor are provided inside

said program memory, said means being constituted by a sequence of instructions and
comprising the whole of said means for controlling the transfer of instructions.
A device as Claimed in Claim 2, characterized, in that said sequence of
instructions includes means for testing whether the current instruction in the external

memory can be interpreted by the interpreter of the digital signal processor, and for
transferring said current instruction directly into the program memory if said means for

testing have given a positive response.
A device as Claimed in Claim 2, characterized, in that said sequence of
instructions includes means for directly processing a current instruction of the external

memory if said means for testing have given a negative response.
A device as claimed in any one of the Claims 2 to 4, characterized in that
said sequence of instructions includes stack control instructions.
A device as claimed in any one of the Claims 2 to 5, characterized in that
said sequence of instructions includes instructions for paging control in the external

memory.
