<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for forming a bag assembly from a tube (86) and
a tubular flexible membrane (80) operates in accordance with

a four step process. This process includes the steps of
clamping the tube within an open end of the membrane,

injecting liquid adhesive into the open end of the
membrane, clamping the membrane and tube where the

adhesive was injected, and heating and curing the
assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silicone bag assembly
for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing and for holding
health care related solutions and, more particularly, to
apparatus for manufacturing such a bag assembly.At the present time, virtually all bags used by the
pharmaceutical industry and for holding health care
related solutions (such as intravenous bags) are
manufactured of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PVC is a
commonly used inexpensive plastic material which is
naturally hard. To soften such material so that it can
be used as a flexible bag and as flexible tubing,
plasticizers such as phthalate esters are added to the
PVC to soften it. Recently there has been concern that
phthalates may leach from the PVC to which they have been
added, thereby contaminating aqueous fluids held in PVC
bags and traveling through PVC tubing. Since PVC bags
are used to store intravenous solutions and blood for
transfusions, phthalates which leach from the PVC are
infused directly into a patient's bloodstream. It has
therefore been proposed to form the bag and tubing from
silicone, which does not react with contacting liquids or
leach chemicals into contacting liquids. Accordingly, a
need exists for apparatus capable of manufacturing such
a bag assembly, particularly in a continuous production 
process.According to the present invention, the bag assembly
is formed from a tube and a tubular flexible membrane
with opposed open ends. The basic inventive apparatus
includes a base for supporting the membrane and the tube
with the tube extending into one of the membrane open
ends, a first clamp adapted to flatten and clamp the
membrane to itself and to the tube along a line spaced
from and substantially parallel to the open end, an
injector adapted to inject liquid adhesive into the open
end and around the tube between the open end and the
line, and a second clamp adapted to flatten and clamp the
membrane to itself and to the tube between the line and
the open end. Accordingly, the first clamp is operative
to prevent injected adhesive from getting into the
interior of the tubular membrane.Using the aforedescribed basic apparatus, a
continuous production manufacturing apparatus is provided
including a pair of endless belt systems arranged for
movement in opposite angular directions. The first belt
system includes a plurality of bases mounted thereon at
a plurality of equally spaced locations. The second belt
system has mounted thereon a plurality of the first and
second clamps and is dimensioned to expose a leading
portion of the

respective tubular flexible membrane with opposed open
ends and a respective tube, the apparatus comprising:


a first endless belt system arranged for movement in
a first angular direction;
a second endless belt system arranged for movement
in a second angular direction opposite said first angular

direction, wherein said second endless belt system
overlies a first portion of said first endless belt

system so as to leave exposed a second portion of said
first endless belt system which immediately precedes said

first portion in the direction of travel of said first
endless belt system;
a plurality of first stations mounted to said first
endless belt system at a plurality of equally spaced

locations and each comprising:

a base adapted to support a respective membrane
with a respective tube extending into one of the

open ends of the respective membrane;
a plurality of second stations mounted to said
second endless belt system at a plurality of equally

spaced locations, wherein the spacing between adjacent
ones of said second stations is equal to the spacing

between adjacent ones of said first stations, each of
said second stations comprising:

when the respective second station overlies a
respective first station in said first portion of

said first endless belt system; and
a second clamp member secured to said second
endless belt system and contacting the respective

underlying first station base when the respective
second station overlies said underlying first

station within said first portion of said first
endless belt system;
