<ABSTRACT>
Assembly system with a machine frame, a circular plate fixed to the machine frame, and a supporting plate concentric with respect to the circular plate and rotationally driven in timed sequence. The radius of the supporting plate is greater than that of the circular plate. The supporting plate has a work-supporting ring at its outer margin and is arranged under the circular plate with merely a gap in between. The work-supporting ring as well as the work stations on the circular plate are driven by means of a single motor/gear arrangement which is driven continuously. The motor/gear arrangement works on the supporting plate by means of a toothed-belt drive via a dwell/step-by-step motion linkage. The motor/gear arrangement works on the individual work stations via a control shaft with mounted cam plates as well as pull/push actuating elements actuated by the cam plates. The pull/push actuating elements in the centre of the assembly system are attached to the work stations through corresponding recesses in the supporting plate and in the circular plate.

An assembly system having a machine frame (1), a circular plate (2) which is fixed to
the machine frame and which carries a multiplicity of workstations (3), and having a receiver

plate (4) which is concentric with respect to the circular plate (2) and which is driven in
rotation in cycles, the radius of which receiver plate is larger than that of the circular plate

(2) and which has a workpiece receiver ring (5) at its outer edge,

wherein the receiver plate (4) is disposed under the circular plate (2) with a clearance spacing
only and the workpiece receiver ring (5) is situated in the region of the height level of the

circular plate (2),
wherein the drive of the workpiece receiver ring (5) and the drive of the workstations (3) is
effected by means of a single motor/transmission arrangement (7) which is continuously

driven and is situated under the receiver plate (4) in the lower part of the machine frame (1),
wherein the motor/transmission arrangement (7) acts on the receiver plate (4) via a

locking/step-by-step motion linkage (9),
wherein the motor/transmission arrangement (7) is fixedly attached to a camshaft (10) which
comprises fitted cam plates (11),
wherein an operating device (12) is provided for the drive of the workstations (3), which
operating device is passed through corresponding apertures (13) in the receiver plate (4) and

in the circular plate (2) and is attached to the workstations,

characterised in that
the motor/transmission arrangement (7) acts on the receiver plate (4) via the locking/step-by-step
motion linkage (9) by means of a first toothed belt drive (8), 
that the cam plates (11) fitted to the camshaft (10) are associated with the individual
workstations (3),
that arcuately guided compression/tension operating elements (12) are used as the operating
device for the drive of the workstations (3), which compression/tension operating elements

are operated by the cam plates (11) and are passed through the apertures (13) in the receiver
plate (4) and in the circular plate (2) and are also passed through an aperture (13) in the

locking/step-by-step motion linkage (9), and are attached to the individual associated
workstations (3),
and the speed of rotation of the motor/transmission arrangement (7) can be regulated and set
to different desired speeds of rotation, and in addition the cam plates (11) can be secured to

the camshaft (10) at different setting angles.
An assembly system according to claim 1, characterised in that the circular plate (2)
is mounted on a central pillar (14) which is surrounded by a hollow shaft (15) for the receiver

plate.
An assembly system according to either one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the
motor/transmission arrangement (7) acts by means of a second toothed belt drive (16) on at

least one camshaft (10) which carries the cam plates (11), and wherein the camshaft (10)
drives the locking/step-by-step motion linkage (9) by means of the first toothed belt drive (8).
An assembly system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
locking/step-by-step motion linkage (9) is disposed on an intermediate table (17) of the

machine fame (1), which intermediate table is situated at a height between the camshaft (10)
and the receiver plate (4).
