<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR PRODUCING GM2 SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relateε to the making of antibodies against glycolipids, and the uses of these antibodieε. More particularly, it relates to processes for making antibodies specific to the monosialogangliosides known as "GM2" and "GM1" , as well as the uses of these antibodies. The uses include diagnostic and screening applications, aε well aε therapeutic modalities. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTGangliosides are a class of moleculeε which are glycolipids. Different gangliosides have been identified as prominent cell surface constituents of various transformed cells, including melanoma, as well as other tumors of neuroectodermal origin. See, e.g., Ritter and Livingston, et al., Sem. Cane. Biol. 2: 401-409 (1991). Oettgen, VCH Verlags Gesellschaft (Weinheim Germany 1989), incorporated by reference in their entirety. Gangliosides are known as mono-, di-, tri or polysialoganglio- sides, depending upon the degree of glycosylation with sialic acid residueε. Abbreviationε employed to identify these molecules include "GM1", "GD3", "GT1" , etc., with the "G" standing for ganglioside, "M" , "D" or "T", etc. referring to the number of sialic acid residues, and the number or number plus letter (e.g., "GTla"), referring to the binding pattern observed for the molecule. See Lehninger, Biochemistry, pg. 294-296 (Worth Publishers, 1981); Wiegandt, in Glycolipids: New comprehensive Biochemistry (Neuberger et al., ed. , Elsevier, 1985), pp. 199-260. The onosialoganglioside GM2 has the structure:GalNAcBl → 4GalBl → 4GlcBl → Ceramide 32αNeuAcwhile GM1 has structure 

 GalBl - 3GalNAcBl - 4GalBl - 4Glcβl→Ceramide3 2αNeuAcAs noted, supra, the gangliosides are prevalent cell surface markers on transformed cells, such as melanoma. This has made them attractive targets for cancer research. Livingston, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84: 2911-2915 (1987) incorporated by reference supra , describe resultε of a vaccine based trial, wherein subjects afflicted with melanoma received, as vaccines, either whole cellε which present high levels of GM2, pure GM2 or pure GM2 plus bacterial adjuvant. Attention is also drawn to Livingston, et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 12(5): 1036-1044 (1994), and Irie, et al. , U.S. Patent No. 4,557,931, both of which are incorporated by reference, and deal with the use of GM2 as a vaccine.There has also been interest in the manufacture and use of antibodies, such as monoclonal antibodies, which bind to ganglioεides. Such antibodies share the
