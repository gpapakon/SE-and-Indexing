<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for selecting a language to communicate with a user of a
voice mail or computer system. A decoder decodes an automatic number identification

(ANI) Caller_ID code or a user ID code to determine the telephone number or identity of
the user. A language database stores a hierarchy of languages to be presented to the user

based on the location or identity of the user. The user is prompted to confirm the language
selection made. If the language is not appropriate, then the next language in the hierarchy

is selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of operating a remotely accessible computer system over a computer network to communicate with a user in a selected language.US 5,440,615 describes a voice messaging system designed to select a language for an announcement to a caller based on source information associated with a call initiated by that caller.WO 95/20859 describes a method and apparatus for pre-selecting a language for interactive telecoms.To facilitate the language needs of a diverse customer and client base, there is a need for computer system that can easily identify the preferred communication language of a remote user accessing the system over a computer network.According to the invention there is provided a method of operating a remotely accessible computer system over a computer network to communicate with a user in a selected language the method comprising: (a) receiving a request from a user over a computer network to connect to a computer system; (b) determining an identity of the user; (c) based on the identity of the user, identifying a stored list of languages to try; (d) selecting a language from the stored list; and (e) prompting the user for an indication that the selected languages is acceptable; if the user does not confirm the acceptability of the selected language repeating steps (d) and (e) if untried languages remain in the list, and otherwise selecting a default language; and transmitting information over the computer network in the selected language to communicate electronically with the user.Embodiments of the invention can be used in Internet applications whereby a server computer creates a "Web page" in a language that is controlled by an address of a user. The server computer preferably maintains a database that matches the language selected by a user with the address of the user.The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a voice mail system;Figure 2 is a flow chart of the steps performed by the voice mail system to select a language to be used in communicating with the user; andFigure 3 is a diagram of a computer system that creates an Internet site in a language that is dependent upon the identity of a user.Figure 1 illustrates a voice mail system 52. The voice mail system includes a telephone interface 54 that

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a remotely accessible computer system (152) over a computer network to communicate with a user in a selected language the method comprising:

a) receiving a request generated by a second computer (160) from a user over a computer network to connect to the computer system (152);
b) determining an identity of the user;
c) based on the identity of the user, identifying a stored list of languages to try;
d) selecting a language from the stored list; and
e) prompting the user for an indication that the selected language is acceptable;

if the user does not confirm the acceptability of the selected language repeating steps d) and e) if untried languages remain in the list, and otherwise selecting a default language; and

transmitting information over the computer network in the selected language to communicate electronically with the user.
The method of claim 1 wherein hypertext mark-up language statements or other commands in the selected language are transmitted to the user.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the list of languages is constructed based on prior language selections made by the user.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the list of languages is constructed by parsing an ID of the user for information concerning the service provider to which the computer (160) used by the user is connected and by storing the languages most often selected by users of that service provider in the language list.
