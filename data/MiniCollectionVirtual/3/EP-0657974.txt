<ABSTRACT>
In a polarization insensitive fiber laser, the optical path comprises an amplifier 
(58) and a pair of 45 degree Faraday rotators (56,60) positioned on either end of 

the fiber gain source, whereby the resulting laser is insensitive to external 
perturbations with respect to known entrance and exit polarization states of the 

laser light and modelocking, both passive and active, is possible. The amplifier 
(58) comprises an Erbium-doped fiber which is coupled to a wavelength division 

multiplexer (62) and a single mode fiber (74).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lasers generally, and more particularly to polarization
independent fiber lasers.Ever since its discovery, the laser has been considered for solving
telecommunications problems because of the high coherence and bandwidth of a laser
beam and the simplicity of focusing the laser beam. Laser light and optical fibers are
becoming increasingly important in the communications industry. Just as the gap
between Einstein's theory (1917) and the building of the first laser (1960) was due to
lack of equipment, the maximum exploitation of lasers in telecommunication
remains theoretical until key technological developments are realized.Lasers (Light Amplification through Stimulated Emission of Radiation) can
produce continuous or pulsed emission. There are two ways to produce pulse
emission: gain switch and modelocking. It is well known that gain switch lasers can
provide short optical pulses on the order of milliseconds to microseconds.
Modelocked lasers can produce shorter optical pulses, on the order of pico seconds or shorter.Large laser systems based on modelocked YAG or YIF are used to generate
short optical pulse for testing the time response of fiber optic communication system.
The time response is related to the maximum rate of transmitting information. As the
speed of telecommunications systems increase, the need for a sub-picosecond testing
impulse source also becomes more acute.Since becoming commercially available, Erbium doped fiber has become the
preferred gain medium for generating short optical pulses in actively and passively 
modelocked lasers. Thus, technological improvements have contributed to progress
toward creating a laser pulse source for testing the time response of
telecommunication systems and for generating repetitive pulses at high data rates.
However, a laser which can maintain a single polarization state, essential to
maintaining optimal laser activity, has remained a technical barrier.The polarization state of light can be described by the amplitudes and phase
relationship of the two oscillating fields of a light wave. In general, output from a
laser or fiber laser has a well-defined single polarization state with a high order of
degree of polarization. As this output light propagates in an isotropic medium (i.e. a
medium with no birefringence - light travels at the same speed along both axes) the
polarization state will not change. However, the output polarization state will vary if
light does not travel along the birefringent axis of an anisotropic
