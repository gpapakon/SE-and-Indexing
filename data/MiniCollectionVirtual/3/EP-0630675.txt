<ABSTRACT>
A leukocyte remover includes a housing having a blood inlet, a 
blood outlet, and a leukocyte-separating filter disposed in the housing such that 

it partitions the interior of the housing into a blood inlet portion and a blood 
outlet portion. The leukocyte filter is composed of one or more three-dimensionally 

reticular, porous members with continuous open pores having a 
most frequent pore diameter of 1 µm to 5 µm and a ratio of weight-average 

pore diameter to number-average pore diameter in the range of 1.5 to 2.5. To 
separate leukocyte and platelets a laminate filter is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to filters for separating leukocytes, leukocyte
removers, filters for separating both leukocytes and platelets, and
leukocyte/platelet removers. It is concerned to provide those having an
excellent capability for capturing leukocytes without suffering from
contamination with foreign matter.In recent years, blood transfusion has largely changed from
conventional whole blood transfusion to blood component transfusion, in
which only a necessary component is transfused to a patient. An important
problem in blood component transfusion is how to increase the purity of
respective fractionated blood components.Blood from donors has conventionally been centrifugally separated
into concentrated red cells (CRC), a platelet concentrate (PC), and a platelet-poor
plasma (PPP). Blood preparations obtained by the separation of blood
are used for blood component transfusion to patients who need red cells or
platelets. However, since a large amount of leukocytes are contained in blood
preparations, problems may sometimes occur if a large amount of leukocytes
are introduced into patients by transfusion.Leukocytes contained in blood preparations must be removed as far
as possible for the purpose of avoiding side effects, particularly post-transfusion
reactions. To date, a number of improvements 
have been proposed for this purpose. In some cases, extraction of red
cells alone by excluding leukocytes and platelets is also required. Used
for these purposes are a method using a capturing member, a
gravitational centrifugal separation method utilizing the difference in
specific gravity between blood cells, a method utilizing the viscidity or
adhesion of leukocytes, etc.Among them, the method using a capturing member is
widely used because of good efficiency in removing leukocytes or
leukocytes and platelets, easiness of handling, etc. Capture members
often used are fibers having extremely small diameters such as natural
fibers, synthetic fibers, etc. packed into a column, or non-woven fabrics
formed by secondarily processing them.The use of such fibers, however, is likely to suffer from
detachment of some fibers or outflow of foreign matters during
operation. If the fiber packing density is increased for the purpose of
sufficiently capturing leukocytes or platelets, trapped blood cells tend to
clog pores between the fibers.On the other hand, there are various proposals to use porous
members as the capturing members. For example, Japanese Patent
Publication No. 61-39060 discloses the use of a porous
