<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions
containing vinyl ether functional silicones and to their
preparation and to their use. Silicone vinyl ethers are
curable by addition of photocleavable acids and exposure to
actinic radiation.Alkenyl ether functional organosilicon compounds
have been described in the art. For example, U.S. Patent
No. 4,617,238 discloses a photopolymerizable composition
wherein only one vinyl ether group for each SiH group is
incorporated into the siloxane molecule at any given time.Other alkenyloxy functional organosilicon compounds
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,707,503; 5,057,549;
5,039,176 and EP Patent No. 0 462 389.The above methods rely on competition between the
vinyl ether group and other alkenyl groups within the same
compound and do not result in quantitative conversion of SiH
to vinyl ether. In contrast, the method of the present
invention yields quantitative conversion of siloxanes to
vinyl ether, a preferred radiation sensitive group.The present invention provides a method for making
vinyl ether functional siloxane, the method comprising the
steps of: (I) reacting (a) a silane having the formula
RxSi(OR1)4-x; (b) water; and (c) an acidic condensation
catalyst, wherein R is a monovalent hydrocarbon or
halohydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, R1
is a monovalent alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon
atoms, x has a value of from 0 to 3, with the proviso that
the molar ratio of water to alkoxy radicals is less than 0.5;
(II) removing alcohol from the mixture of step (I); (III) 
neutralizing the mixture of step (II); (IV) adding a vinyl
ether compound having the formula HOR2OCH=CH2 wherein R2 is a
divalent hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon radical having from 1
to 20 carbon atoms to the mixture of step (III); (V) adding a
transesterification catalyst to the mixture of step (IV); and
(VI) removing volatiles from the mixture of step (V).An alternative method of making a vinyl ether
functional siloxane comprises the steps of: (I) reacting in
the presence of a non-acidic equilibration catalyst (a) a
cyclic compound having the formula

and (b) a compound having the formula HOR1OCH=CH2, wherein R
is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical or halohydrocarbon
radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, R1 is a divalent
hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20
carbon atoms and x has a value of from 3 to 10; (II) removing
volatiles from the mixture of step (I); and (III)
neutralizing the mixture of step (II).The present invention further relates to
