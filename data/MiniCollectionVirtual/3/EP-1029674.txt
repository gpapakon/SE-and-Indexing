<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a printing system 100 and method having a
printhead assembly 116 that controls firing operations of an inkjet printhead 236.

In particular, the system 100 and method control the firing and timing decisions
pertaining to ink drop ejection through the use of various types of delays. The

printing system includes a controller 110, a power supply 114 and a printhead
assembly 116. The printhead assembly 116 includes a memory device 122 and

a distributive processor 124 integrated with an ink driver head 126.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to inkjet and other types of printers
and more particularly to a novel printing system that includes a system and method
for controlling the firing operations of an inkjet printhead.Inkjet printers are commonplace in the computer field. These printers are
described by W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in "Ink Jet Devices," Chapter 13 of Output
Hardcopy Devices (Ed. R.C. Durbeck and S. Sherr, San Diego: Academic Press,
1988) and U.S. Patents 4,490,728 and 4,313,684). Inkjet printers produce high
quality print, are compact and portable, and print quickly and quietly because only ink
strikes a printing medium, such as paper.An inkjet printer produces a printed image by printing a pattern of individual
dots at particular locations of an array defined for the printing medium. The locations
are conveniently visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear array. The locations
are sometimes "dot locations", "dot positions", or "pixels". Thus, the printing
operation can be viewed as the filling of a pattern of dot locations with dots of ink.Inkjet printers print dots by ejecting very small drops of ink onto the print
medium and typically include a movable carriage that supports one or more print
cartridges each having a printhead with ink ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses
over the surface of the print medium. An ink supply, such as an ink reservoir,
supplies ink to the nozzles. The nozzles are controlled to eject drops of ink at
appropriate times pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller. The
timing of the application of the ink drops typically corresponds to the pattern of pixels
of the image being printed. In general, the small drops of ink are ejected from the nozzles through orifices
or nozzles by rapidly heating a small volume of ink located in vaporization chambers
with small electric heaters, such as small thin film resistors. The small thin film
resistors are usually located adjacent the vaporization chambers. Heating the ink
causes the ink to vaporize and be ejected from the orifices (also known as "firing").Specifically, for one dot of ink, a remote printhead controller, which is usually
located as part of the processing electronics of the printer, activates an electrical
current from an external power supply. The electrical current is passed through a
selected thin film resistor of a selected vaporization chamber. The resistor is then
heated for superheating a thin layer of ink located within the selected vaporization
chamber, causing explosive
