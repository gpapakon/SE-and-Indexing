<ABSTRACT>
Articulated double-deck train consisting of double-deck intermediate units and head units which are connected in an articulated fashion and can be coupled and decoupled. The double-deck intermediate units are provided at one end with a drivable single-axle bogey (6) or if desired with a non-driven single-axle bogey. The other end rests in the coupled state on the coupling component 14 of an articulated coupling on the following unit. In the uncoupled state, a double-deck intermediate unit is supported on a lowerable bogey with preferably drivable wheel flange rollers. Various types of double-deck intermediate units are present. The essential ones are a double-deck passenger unit (1), a double-deck passenger entry unit (4) and a double-deck entry unit. Double-axle double-deck head units with their own drive, driver's cab and current collector are present as the start and end of the train. With the existing double-deck intermediate units and head units, double-deck articulated trains can be made up with various combinations corresponding to their use, dismantled again and reformed because the coupling used is designed as a disconnectable articulated coupling.

<CLAIMS>
Double-decker articulated train consisting of articulatedly connected head and 
intermediate units (1, 2, 3, 4), single-axle bogeys (6) at the articulation joints, entrances at 

the intermediate units and passages at the articulation joints as well as of operationally 
couplable and uncouplable double-decker intermediate units (1, 3, 4) and double-decker 

head units (2) and with single-axle bogeys (6) each at one end of each intermediate unit 
and movable hinge couplings at the articulation joints, characterised thereby, that the 

passages at the articulation joints between the double-decker units (1, 3, 4) are 
constructed to be double-decked each in the form of a separate passage in each of the 

lower deck and the upper deck and that the double-decker units (1, 3, 4) comprise a 
circumferentially closed gangway bellows (17) aligned with the external outline of the 

double-decker unit (1, 3, 4) at one end and a collar (25), which receives the gangway 
bellows (17), in an end face frame surface (20) at the other end and that the hinge 

couplings (14, 15) at the articulation joints are movable in three axes. 
Double-decker articulated train according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
lower horizontal part of the collar (25) is constructed as tread plate (26) with upwardly 

tiltable side parts (24). 
Double-decker articulated train according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that a 
termination housing (27) is present, which forms a train end, is provided with train end 

lights (28) and is settable onto and fastenable at the collar (25) of a double-decker unit (1, 
3, 4).
