 "Heterocyclic-substituted Pyridine Compounds and Uses"Scope of the Invention This invention relates to the use of certain heterocycle-substituted pyridine compounds useful for treating diseases arising from or related to leukotrienes, particularly leukotriene B4. As such there utility lies in antagonizing the affects of leukotrienes.Background of the Invention The family of bioactive lipids known as the leukotrienes exert pharmacological effects on respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. The leukotrienes are generally divided into two sub-classes, the peptidoleukotrienes (leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4) and the dihydroxyleukotrienes (leukotriene B4). This invention is primarily concerned with the hydroxyleukotrienes (LTB) but is not limited to this specific group of leukotrienes.The peptidoleukotrienes are implicated in the biological response associated with the "Slow Reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis" (SRS-A). This response is expressed in vivo as prolonged bronchoconstriction, in cardiovascular effects such as coronary artery vasoconstriction and numerous other biological responses. The pharmacology of the peptidoleukotrienes include smooth muscle contractions, myocardial depression, increased vascular peπneabϋity and increased mucous production.By comparison, LTB4 exerts its biological effects through stimulation of leukocyte and lymphocyte functions. It stimulates chemotaxis, chemokinesis and aggregation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).Leukotrienes are critically involved in mediating many types of cardiovascular, pulmonary, dermatological, renal, allergic, and inflammatory diseases including asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fϊbrosis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was first described by Borgeat and Samuelsson in 1979, and later shown by Corey and co-workers to be 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-(Z,E,E,Z)-6,8,10,14- eicosatetraenoic acid.It is a product of the arachidonic acid cascade that results from the enzymatic hydrolysis of LTA4. It has been found to be produced by mast cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes and macrophages. LTB4 has been shown to be a potent stimulus in vivo for PMN leukocytes, causing increased chemotactic and chemokinetic migration, adherence, aggregation, degranulation, superoxide production and cytotoxicity. The effects of LTB4 are mediated through distinct receptor sites on the leukocyte cell surface that exhibit a high degree of stereospecifiάty. Pharmacological studies on human blood PMN leukocytes
