<ABSTRACT>
A duplicating apparatus comprises an image reading unit which reads an original optically and outputs image signals; an 
image processing unit which processes the image signals received from the image reading unit by a given method, and outputs image 

data; a printer unit (1) which forms on a recording sheet an image corresponding to the image data received from the image 
processing unit; a judging unit which determines whether the probability that the original is a particular one such as a bill is in a 

first rank or a second rank lower than the first rank; a control unit which prohibits the formation of images corresponding to the 
original on the recording sheet when the result of the judgement by the judging unit shows the first rank; and a marking unit 

which makes a given mark on the recording sheet if the result of the judgment shows the second rank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a copying
apparatus having a determination unit for determining
whether or not an original to be copied is an special
original, such as paper money and securities, which are
prohibited from being copied by law.In recent years, due to improvement of an
image processing technique and an image forming
technique, a copy of paper money obtained by a color
copy machine is so exquisite that it is difficult to
distinguish the copy from the actual paper money. Thus,
a color copy machine has been proposed, in which a
special original such as the paper money, prohibited
from being copied by law is detected and a copy
operation for such special original is prohibited from
being carried out.In an image recording apparatus disclosed, for 
example, in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application JP-A-2-83571,
image data obtained by reading of an original is
compared with registered pattern data corresponding to a
special original using a pattern matching method. It is
then determined based on the comparison result whether
or not the original is the special original (such as the
paper money). When it is determined that the original
is the special original, a copying operation for the
original is prohibited or an image (an all black image)
different from an original image is formed on a paper.However, since there are limitations of image
reading accuracy and image analyzing accuracy, it is
difficult to determine, at a accuracy of 100%, whether
or not an original set on the copy machine is the
special original. Thus, a degree to which an image
obtained by reading the original (an input image) is
similar to the pattern data is evaluated as a similarity
value. If the similarity value for the input image is
equal to or greater than a predetermined reference
similarity value, it is generally determined that the
original to be copied is the special original, such as in EP-A-506 332.In a case where it is determined, using the
similarity value as has been described above, whether or
an original set on the copy machine is the special
original, if the original is clearly seen as being the 
special original, or if the original is clearly seen as
being not the special original, it can be accurately
determined whether or not the original is the special
original or not. However, in a case of the original
which is hardly seen as being the special original, such
as a case of dirty paper money or sample of securities,
the determination result depends on the reference
similarity value set in the copy machine.

<CLAIMS>
A copying apparatus comprising:

image reading means (102) for optically reading an original and for
outputting image signals corresponding to the original;
image processing means (301) for processing the image signals supplied from
said image reading means (102) so that

image signals are converted into image data and for outputting image data;
image forming means (104) for forming an image corresponding to the image
data supplied from said image processing means on a recording sheet;
original determination means (400) for determining whether a rank of
certainty that the original is a predetermined special original is a first rank or a

second rank lower than the first rank;
information adding means for adding predetermined information to the
recording sheet, using a special ink, on which the image is formed by said image forming means when

the determination result obtained by said original determination means is the second
rank;
characterized
 by

prohibiting means for prohibiting the image corresponding to the original
from being formed on the recording sheet when the determination result obtained by

said original determination means is the first rank;
wherein predetermined information is added in a separate step from an image forming step carried out by said image forming means to the
recording sheet on which the image is formed.
The copying apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said information
adding means (112) is located separately from said image forming means

(104).
The copying apparatus as claimed in claim 1,

further comprising a reversing path (603) for reversing the recording sheet,
wherein the predetermined information is added onto the backside of the
recording sheet.
The copying apparatus as claimed in claim
1, wherein said original determination means (400) comprises:


storage means (402) for storing reference data
representing a characteristic of the predetermined

special original;
characteristic extracting means (401) for
generating, based on the image signals from said image

reading means (102), characteristic data representing a
characteristic of the original;
comparing means (403) for comparing the
characteristic data generated by said characteristic

extracting means (401) and the reference data in said storage
means (402) with each other and for generating a similarity 

value representing a degree of similarity between the
characteristic data and the reference data;
first determination means (404) for determining

similarity value, wherein when said first determination
means (404) determines that the similarity value is equal to

or greater than the first reference similarity value,
said original determination means (400) determines that the
