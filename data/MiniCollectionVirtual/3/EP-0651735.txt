<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel α-(tertiary-aminomethyl)-benzenemethanol
derivatives having
pharmacological properties, and to processes for their
preparation. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical
compositions containing these derivatives and the use of the novel
derivatives for the manufacture of a medicament.Urinary incontinence is a very common disorder in both
men and women. Large or smaller amounts of urine are
involuntarily expelled from the bladder. There are two main
types of urinary incontinence, i.e. urge incontinence and
stress incontinence. Very few drugs are available for
treatment of the latter type and they have been found to have
low efficacy and significant side-effects.DD-A-210 031 discloses a process for the preparation of
pharmacologically active 1-aryl-2-aminoethanols. Specifically
described are phenylethanolamines which are either
unsubstituted or mono-substituted in phenyl ring positions 2
or 4, or tri-substituted in positions 3, 4 and 5.EP-A-103 830 discloses growth-promoting
phenylethanolamine derivatives. No compounds di-substituted in
positions 2 and 3 of the phenyl ring are specifically
described.EP-A-213 108 discloses pharmaceutical formulations
containing an α- and/or β-sympathicomimetic agent in the form
of a phenylethanolamine derivative. The only specific compound
mentioned is 1-(3'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-aminoethanol.US-A-4,349,549 discloses hypertensively active ω-aryl-ω-hydroxyalkyl-spiropiperidine
heterocycles.According to the present invention it has been found that
a novel class of 2,3-disubstituted-α-(tertiary-aminomethyl)benzenemethanol
derivatives have properties making them 
suitable for the treatment of disorders related to urinary
incontinence, and which novel derivatives have higher efficacy
and lower side-effects than the prior art drugs.In one aspect, the present invention therefore provides
novel compounds which may be represented by the general
formula I:

wherein
R1 is selected from C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, C1-6 alkenyloxy,
C1-6 alkylthio, C1-6 alkenylthio and aryl C1-6 alkoxy, wherein aryl is as defined below;R2 is selected from halogen, hydroxy, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy,
C1-6 alkenyloxy, C1-6 alkylthio, C1-6 alkenylthio, C1-6 alkylamino,
trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, C1-6 alkylsulfinyl, C1-6 alkylsulfonyl,
C1-5 acyl, benzoyl and cinnamoyl;R3 and R4 either independently represent C1-6 alkyl or
C1-6 alkenyl, or R3 and R4 are interconnected to form together with the nitrogen atom a
5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring, optionally
containing one or
