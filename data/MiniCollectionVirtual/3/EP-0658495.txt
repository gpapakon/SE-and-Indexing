<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
interoperational store. US Patent n. 4,254,858 relates to an 
interoperational store comprising a helical belt wound 
about a fixed central cylindrical drum which presents a 
central axis coaxial with the axis of the helical belt, 
and an outer helical guide groove engaged in sliding 
manner by the inner periphery of at least part of the 
helical belt. The helical belt is connected to a drive 
device by which it is rotated about the central axis of 
the cylindrical drum so as to engage a longer or shorter 
portion of the helical groove, and flex axially between 
a minimum capacity position, wherein all the turns of 
the helical belt are free of the helical groove and 
packed against one another, and a maximum capacity 
position, wherein all the turns are distended, are 
equally spaced along the central drum, and engage the 
helical groove. A drawback of the above known store is the equal 
axial spacing of the turns of the helical belt, which  
 
means the store is only economically feasible for loose 
products small enough to be stacked in layers between 
adjacent turns of the belt, or for products of a maximum 
size approximately equal to but no larger than the 
spacing of the belt. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an interoperational store designed to overcome 
the above drawback. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an interoperational store comprising plate 
supporting means for products, the supporting means 
presenting a supporting surface of variable size and 
comprising a helical strip in turn comprising a variable 
number of turns wound about a central axis; guide means 
connected to the helical strip and for guiding the turns 
in the strip along a helical path with a given spacing; 
and drive means for rotating the helical strip about 
said central axis to vary the number of said turns 
located along said path; characterized in that it also 
comprises adjusting means associated with said guide 
means, for adjusting said spacing as required within a 
given range. According to a preferred embodiment of the above 
store, the turns of the helical strip are elastically 
deformable, by said drive means, along said central axis 
and between an extended position, wherein substantially 
all the turns are located along said helical path, and a 
packed position wherein only a first turn at least  
 
partially engages the helical path. In the above store, said central axis preferably 
extends vertically; the turns, in use,
