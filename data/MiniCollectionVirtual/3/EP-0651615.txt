<ABSTRACT>
A composition which provides for rehydration and endurance in persons having symptoms of physiological stress comprises a blend of simple sugars and more complex carbohydrates and, at least magnesium, in the form of an amino acid chelate. Preferably the carbohydrate source is a blend of crystalline fructose and glucose polymers in a weight ratio of between about 4:1 and 1:4. Other ingredients, including anabolic nutrients, vitamins, electrolyte ions (e.g. potassium, sodium, chloride), and other minerals, such as calcium amino acid chelate, may be added as desired to provide an optimal rehydration and endurance formulation. When administered, the carbohydrate blend and amino acid chelates facilitate rehydration and the delivery of nutrients and calorie energy to appropriate sites within the body for efficient utilization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to dietary supplements, and more 
particularly to an endurance and rehydration composition comprising glucose 
polymers, crystalline fructose and bioavailable minerals for use as a nutritional 
supplement. It is well known that both negative energy balance and muscle catabolism 
are consequences of physiological stress that often accompanies protein calorie 
malnutrition, strenuous physical exercise, physical trauma, burn injury, surgical 
trauma, malnutrition, maldigestion, malabsorption, hyperthyroidism, 
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, anorexia, cachexia, short bowel syndrome, old 
age and sepsis. It is also known that maintaining a positive metabolic energy 
balance can help to alleviate such problems and also has a sparing effect on 
muscle catabolism that occurs during strenuous physical exertion causing fatigue. In order to properly combat the above symptoms it is essential that 
appropriate amounts of nutrients be available to supplant those which are utilized. 
For example, during periods of physiological stress, the body may burn large 
amounts of energy and may also be depleted of body fluids and minerals. Proper 
food energy (available calories), hydration and mineral bioavailability are 
essential to enable the body to maintain a proper balance in both intracellular and 
extracellular fluids and to also maintain proper enzymatic functioning, pH 
balance, osmotic pressure and the like. Therefore, in order to promote 
endurance and accomplish rehydration it is necessary, in addition to water, to 
provide a sustained source of energy and also a source of minerals which can be 
directed to proper cellular and/or tissue sites in the course of the rehydration 
process. Currently, many types of endurance and rehydration formulas are 
marketed which are generally made up of different carbohydrates including corn  
 
syrup, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, fructose and maltodextrin. 
Additionally, many of these prior art formulas contain relatively insignificant 
quantities of magnesium and are generally high in sodium chloride content. 
Though these formulas are generally suitable as nutritional supplements, they 
possess certain inherent deficiencies which detract from their overall utility. In 
this respect, these formulas typically do not contain a carbohydrate balance 
between readily assimilated simple sugars, for immediate utilization for energy 
and rehydration, and more complex carbohydrates for sustained endurance over 
a period of time. Moreover,
