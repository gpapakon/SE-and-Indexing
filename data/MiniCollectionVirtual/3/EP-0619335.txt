<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel catalyst compositions
suitable for use in preparing polyketones.It is known to produce polyketones, which are linear
alternating polymers of (a) one or more olefins and (b) carbon
monoxide, by a liquid phase process in which the olefin(s) and
carbon monoxide are polymerised together in methanol, ethanol or
propanol solvent in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Such a
process, which is disclosed in more detail in for example
EP 121965 and EP 314309, typically employs a catalyst derived from
(a) a palladium compound (b) a source of an anion which is either
non-coordinating or only weakly coordinating to palladium and (c)
a bisphosphine of formula R1R2P-R-PR3R4 where R1 to R4 are
independently aryl groups which can optionally be polar
substituted and R is a divalent organic bridging group such as -
(CH2)n- (n=2 to 6). The source of the anion is typically its
conjugate acid.It is furthermore known from EP-A-246683 that polyketones
can also be prepared if component (b) in the catalyst is replaced
by tin chloride or germanium chloride. Such salts of a strong
acid and a weak base are electron acceptors, and thus "Lewis"
acids.EP-A-508502 discloses catalyst compositions comprising:
a) a Group VIII metal compound,b) a Lewis acid of the general formula MFn in which M represents
an element that can form a Lewis acid with fluorine, F represents 
fluorine and n has the value 3 or 5, andc) a dentate ligand containing at least two phosphorus-, nitrogen-
or sulphur-containing dentate groups through which the dentate
ligand can complex with the Group VIII metal.A problem with the prior art catalyst compositions is to
improve their reaction rate.It has now been found that high reaction rates can be
obtained using catalyst compositions based upon Group VIII metal
compounds in conjunction with specific boron compounds.According to the present invention there is provided a
catalyst composition for preparing polyketones comprising:-
(a) a Group VIII metal compound, containing at least one ligand
capable of coordinating to the Group VIII metal and(b) a boron hydrocarbyl compound preferably a Lewis acid of the
formula BXYZ where at least one of X Y and Z is a monovalent
hydrocarbyl group. A further advantage of the present invention is the ability
to significantly reduce or totally eliminate the need to use
protonic acids especially those having a low pKa e.g. less than 2
although small quantities of water can be tolerated. It is
thought that if residual quantities of such acids are
