<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is to simplify the presently employed 
complicated processes necessary to manufacture a zinc-oxide 

varistor, comprised of a process to sinter zinc-oxide element at 
high temperature and a separate process to sinter its electrodes 

coated on said element, yet to obtain an improved varistor 
characteristics. 
Said varistor element contains zinc-oxide as a main constituent 
and at least bismuth and antimony as accessory constituents. 

In this case, the content of bismuth in terms of Bi₂O₃ is 
in a range from 0.1 to 4.0 mol% and the content of antimony in 

terms of Sb₂O₃ constitutes a mol-ratio of Sb₂O₃/Bi₂O3 ≦ 1.0. These 
materials are mixed thoroughly and are pressed into a compact. 

After coating both sides of said compact with Ag or Ag-Pd paste, 
said compact and its electrodes are sintered simultaneously at 

a temperature of 800 to 960°C

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a varistor developed to protect
electronic devices such as television receivers when abnormally
high surge voltage is applied thereon, and its manufacturing
method.Since modern electronic devices such as television receivers
have to be provided with an increased number of functions, circuits
of more complicated and higher integration have to be incorporated
therein. In addition to this, these complicated circuits
have to be protected against possible surge voltage by
means of an electronic device such as varistor made of zinc-oxide.
Therefore, the demand for the varistor of this type is
rapidly increasing also.Conventional zinc-oxide varistor can be manufactured by
mixing zinc oxide with nickel, cobalt, and antimony compounds,
and these materials are molded into a compact which is then
sintered at a temperature of 1150 to 1350°C. This sintered
compact is then coated with electrode paste made of platinum or
palladium and baked to form two electrodes thereon.However, when antimony added to the materials as an
accessory constituent, the compact can not be sintered thoroughly
at the above-mentioned temperature, and this had been a primary
problem of this type of varistor. From US-A-5,075,661, there is known a varistor primary composed of ZnO and further
comprises predetermined concentrations of Bi2O3 in a selected ratio with Sb2O3 wherein
Sample 902 discloses a ratio of Sb2O3 / Bi2O3 of 0.3, from which a Sb2O3 content of 0.9
mol% can be calculated.The objective of the present invention is to solve this
problem, and to offer a composition of varistor which can be
sintered at a relatively low temperature of 800 to 1000°C despite
antimony added as an accessory constituent. Furthermore, the
invention is to offer a manufacturing method thereof also.The above object in terms of a varistor is achieved by the subject matter of claim 1.Furthermore, as additional accessory constituents, at least
more than one element among lead, germanium, or tin in terms of
PbO, GeO2, or SnO2 can be contained in the varistor of the
invention at an amount of (PbO + GeO2 + SnO2) ≤ 0.5 mol%.Moreover, as additional accessory constituents, at least
more than one elements among lead, germanium, or tin in terms of
PbO, GeO2, or SnO2 can be contained in the varistor of the
invention at an amount of (PbO + GeO2 + SnO2) ≤ 0.15 mol%.Moreover, as a still other accessory constituent, aluminum
in terms of Al2O3 can be contained in the varistor of the
invention at an amount of 0.001 -0.01 mol%. Furthermore, the varistor
