<ABSTRACT>
A signal processor for extracting chrominance information from a composite video signal has transversal filters (45, 46) developing first and second signals (A and B). A look-up table (47) generates a control signal (C) which is a non-linear function of the ratio A/B and simultaneously develops the product B*C. A filter of this form can combine steep frequency response with minimal degradation of the response to pulses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the processing of analogue or
digital video signals and is concerned in the most important
example with filtering techniques.A well known filtering technique involves calculation of
the linear sum of several copies of the input signal shifted
in time or space. These copies are then summed with
appropriate weights using appropriate coefficient multipliers
and adders. The frequency characteristic and pulse response
of the resultant filter are linked by the well known Fourier
transform. It is a fundamental limitation that, all other
things being equal, narrowing the frequency bandwidth of the
filter lengthens the pulse response, and vice versa. It is
not generally possible to achieve simultaneously a narrow
frequency bandwidth and a short pulse response.US-A-4 322 641 discloses a system for audio noise
reduction in which an upper bandwidth limit is adjusted
according to a relationship between signal rate of change and
instantaneous amplitude within a selected frequency band.In a variety of applications, particularly in video
signal processing, it is often desirable to suppress or to
extract a narrow band of the incoming signal frequency range
without any significant signal delay and without the
appearance of overshoots or ripples on the pulse response.It is, therefore, an object of one aspect of the present
invention to provide an improved method of filtering capable
of combining both narrow band filtering and short, ripple-free
pulse response. It is another object of one aspect of the present invention to provide an
improved filter which offers steep frequency response without placing
unduly high demands on the complexity of the filter circuitry and without
introducing untoward delay in the signal path.Accordingly, the present invention consists in one aspect in a method of
filtering an input video signal, comprising the steps of conducting first and
second linear filtering operation s on the input signal to derive respective
first and second intermediate signals; taking a ratio of said intermediate
signals to derive a control signal and modifying the frequency spectrum
of the input signal in dependence upon the control signal.Advantageously, the control signal is passed through a non-linear device
before use in modifying the frequency spectrum of the input signal.In another aspect, the present invention consists in apparatus for filtering
an input video signal, comprising an input video terminal; a first linear
filter connected to said input terminal; a second linear filter
