<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substantially 
pure opioid receptors, and the nucleotide sequence 
encoding the opioid receptor. Opioids are a chemically diverse group of 
compounds which includes naturally occurring peptides 
and alkaloids as well as a large number of synthetic 
analogs. The physiological effects of opioid agonists 
include analgesia, drowsiness, changes in mood, respiratory 
depression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, 
nausea, vomiting and alterations in the endocrine and 
autonomic nervous systems (Jaffe and Martin, in The 
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Gilman, A.G. et 
al., eds.; MacMillan, New York, pages 491-531, 1985). The physiological actions of opioids are 
mediated through specific receptors that exist in the 
responsive tissues. Invitro characterization of these 
receptors by binding of radiolabelled opioid alkaloids 
to brain membranes was first described in 1973 by three 
independent groups of investigators was used to 
searchfor endogenous opioids in vertebrate brain. This 
search led to the discovery of met- and leu-enkephalin, 
two opioid pentapeptides, in 1975. In that same year, 
other opioid peptides (derived from the gene later 
designated as "POMC") were discovered in the pituitary. 
Selective binding of the different peptide and 
nonpeptide opioids to the receptors in membranes derived  
 
from different tissues and brain regions plus 
correlations with pharmacological selectivities of the 
opioid drugs established the existence of opioid 
receptor subclasses (history reviewed by A. Goldstein in 
Opioids: Past, Present and Future, Collier, H.O.J. et 
al., eds.; Taylor and Frances Ltd., London, 1984, 
pages 127-143). The best characterized classes of opiate 
receptors are the mu (m), delta (w) and kappa (k) 
classes, based on clear differences in their ligand 
selectivities and pharmacological effects (Lord etal., 
Nature, 267:495-499, 1977). Sigma (s) (Jaffe and 
Martin, supra), and epsilon e (Schulz etal., J. 
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 216:604-606, 1981) are also 
thought to exist, based on differential pharmacology and 
ligand binding. There is also evidence for receptor 
subtypes within these major classes (Jaffe and Martin, 
supra). The best characterized effects of opioids on 
cell metabolism are decreased Ca²⁺ conductance, increased 
K⁺ conductance and decreased levels of cAMP (Loh 
and Smith, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 30:123-147, 
1990). These functions are among those known to be 
regulated by the receptor-associated G proteins, which 
also
