<ABSTRACT>
The oven comprises a housing (19) in which two radial-flow 
blowers (15) disposed at symmetrical positions with vertical 

axes of rotation (18) generate a flow of air heated by respective 
heater means (13), in a closed circuit including 

respective delivery chambers (10), a cooking chamber (6), 
and an intake chamber (8). The blowers (15) rotate in opposite 

directions relative to one another to thereby create a 
uniform air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a forced-convection cooking 
oven particularly, but not exclusively, for commercial use. As known for instance from EP-B-0 344 743, modern forced-convection 
ovens basically comprise a housing, with a cooking 
chamber defined therein for the accommodation of a plurality 
of shelves or the like adapted to support the foods to 
be cooked thereon. In particular, the shelves are adapted to 
be disposed above one another at different levels defined by 
respective support rails provided in the cooking chamber. 
Also provided within the housing are heater means for heating 
a flow of air generated by at least one blower for circulating 
in a substantially closed circuit comprising a 
delivery chamber, the cooking chamber, and an inlet chamber. 
The delivery chamber, which normally houses the heater means, 
is separated from the cooking chamber by a perforated partition. 
The blower is usually a centrifugal ventilator from 
which air is delivered in a turbulent flow to the delivery 
chamber, which is generally of parallelepipedic configuration. 
As a result, the forced air flow assumes a non-uniform 
distribution, tending to concentrate in the corners of 
the delivery chamber, from where it is directed into the 
cooking chamber through lateral distributor passages. For 
minimizing the non-uniformity of the air distribution it has 
been proposed to provide suitably arranged openings in 
the partition and/or in the walls of the lateral distributor 
passages. The shapes and locations of these openings were 
carefully and individually determined on an empirical basis. 
In any case, it is well known that these provisions are only 
partially successful in improving the distribution of the 
air in the delivery chamber. It is however particularly important 
to obtain maximum uniformity of the distribution of 
the air circulation in the cooking chamber to thereby ensure 
a correspondingly uniform cooking of the foods supported on  
 
the shelves at different levels. This requirement gets 
obviously more important as the number of shelves disposed 
above one another in the cooking chamber increases. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a 
forced-convection cooking oven of simple construction and 
capable of maintaining a substantially uniform air circulation 
in its interior. According to the invention, this object is attained in a 
forced-convection cooking oven incorporating the characteristics 
of the appended claims. The characteristics and advantages of the invention
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>

blower means are adapted to circulate, in a substantially 

closed circuit including at least a delivery chamber, a 
cooking chamber, and an intake chamber, a flow of air in 

thermal exchange relationship with heater means, there being 
provided within said cooking chamber a plurality of substantially 

horizontal shelves for the support thereon of 
foods to be cooked, characterized in that said blower means 

comprise at least one tangential-flow blower (15) disposed 
with its axis of rotation (18) extending substantially 

vertical.

casing including said delivery, cooking and intake chambers 

is of substantially symmetric construction with respect to a 
vertical imaginary plane passing through the center of 

said casing, characterized in that said tangential-flow 
blower (15) is disposed in said casing (19) between said 

intake chamber (24) and said delivery chamber (10), at a 
lateral position adjacent a rear corner of said casing. 
A cooking oven according to claim 1, wherein said 
casing including said delivery, cooking and intake chambers 

is of substantially symmetric construction with respect to a 
vertical imaginary plane passing through the center of 

said casing, characterized in that said blower means comprises 
two tangential flow blowers (15) disposed in said casing 

(19) with their axes of rotation (18) extending substantially 
vertical at symmetric positions on opposite 

 
sides of said plane (16), said blowers (15) being adapted to 

rotate in opposite directions relative to one another. 
A cooking oven according to claim 4, characterized in 
that each tangential-flow blower (15) is disposed in said 

casing (19) between said intake chamber (8) and a respective 
delivery chamber (10), said delivery chambers extending at 

symmetrical positions with respect to said vertical plane. 
A coking oven according to claim 5, characterized in 
that said heater means comprises at least one heater 

assembly (13) disposed in each of said delivery chambers 
(10) at symmetrical positions. 
A cooking oven according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said tangential-flow blower (15) is adapted to be
