Folding packaging box from two cardboard blanks, in which rectangular bottom, 
and cover parts (6,7) are connected via longitudinal sides (4a, 4b) having pre-grooved 

fold lines, and are thus being shaped in one piece, and in which the 
crosswise sides (2a, 2b) are connected with segment (1), which corresponds in size 

to the bottom part (6), via several folds using pre-grooved fold lines, and are shaped 
in one piece, characterized in that the rectangular bottom and cover parts (6, 

7) are further linked with a loop (8) and that segment (1) forms an inset (1), which 
by folding alongside pre-grooved fold lines runnig at right angles provides for a 

subdivided compartment (3). 
Folding packaging box according to claim 1, characterized in that the cross-wise 
sides (2a, 2b) are glued to inset (1), which in turn is glued to the bottom part 

(6) of the other cardboard blank. 
Folding packaging box according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
