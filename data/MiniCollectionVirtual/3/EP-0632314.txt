<ABSTRACT>
A lens-fitted photo film unit (1) has a body (10) in which a 
cassette containing chamber (15) is pre-loaded with a photo film 

cassette. A photo film chamber contains unexposed photo film 
in a form of roll as drawn out of the cassette. A photo film 

winding wheel (6) is rotated after each exposure to rotate a 
spool in the cassette shell into which the photo film is 

wound. An apparatus for assembling the photo film unit has a 
dark box (30), which has three supply openings (30a-30c) into 

which parts are 
supplied, and an exit opening (30d) from which the body loaded with 

the photo film is exited. Four intermediate cells (34a-34d) of the dark 
box (30) shield ambient light, and include outer 

shutter plates (33a-33d) 
and inner shutter plates (35a-35d), which are disposed in the supply 

openings and the exit opening, shield ambient light, and are 

opened/closed in alternation. A cassette supplying loader 
and a robot hand (RH) transfer the cassette into the dark box (30), 

while a leading tongue (46a) of the photo film is protruded from 
the cassette shell, with a remaining portion of the photo 

film contained as a roll. A roll forming fork device (63) winds 
the photo film as much as a predetermined length from the 

cassette as supplied, and forms the photo film into the roll. 
A photo film mounting mechanism swings the roll and the 

cassette shell together to change orientation thereof, and 
loads the roll and the cassette shell into the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a
method for automatically assembly a lens-fitted photo film unit.
More particularly the present invention relates to an
improvement of photo film loading apparatus and method in
which loading processes are highly automated.Known lens-fitted photo film units (hereinafter referred
to simply as photo film units) are disclosed in US-A-4,884,087
and US-A-4,972,649 (both corresponding to JP-B-2-32615),
and are now on the market,
e.g. under the trade name "Fujicolor Quick Snap" (manufactured
by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Such photo film units
are a single-use camera pre-loaded with photo filmstrip
(hereinafter referred to as photo film) in a cassette of a
135-type, as defined by ISO 1007, 1979 version, and incorporate
a taking lens, a shutter device, and other mechanisms
for photography. The photo film unit has a mechanism for
winding the photo film, but lacks a mechanism of feeding the
film in reverse to the winding, for the purpose of reduction 
in cost of production. A user who has purchased the photo
film unit winds the photo film frame by frame back into the
cassette after each exposure. In production of the photo
film unit, a loading apparatus draws the photo film out of a
cassette shell in a darkroom to give it a form of a roll, and
loads a photo film chamber with the roll of the photo film,
while loading a cassette containing chamber with the cassette
shell.To form the roll from the drawn photo film, the loading
apparatus has a station for winding the photo film. The roll
forming station has a shaft device on which a leader of the
photo film is secured. Although the roll is formed in the
darkroom, a manual operation in an illuminated room is conventionally
required before forming the roll. With the
cassette shell set in the roll forming station, the manual
operation pulls a predetermined length of the leader out of
the cassette shell, and secures the leader of the photo film
on the shaft device. The conventional operation of loading
of the photo film requires much time. The length of pulling
the leader from the cassette shell tends to change due to
changes in the manual operation. A pulled portion on the
leader is exposed to ambient light, and fogged. Accordingly
a length of the photo film usable for the exposures cannot be
determined as constant. An available maximum number of
exposures conventionally must be as small as a standard
number of which exposures could be safely taken without being
fogged. GB 2 237 120 describes a disposable camera and an
