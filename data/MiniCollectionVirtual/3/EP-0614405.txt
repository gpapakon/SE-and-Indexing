<ABSTRACT>
In a clinched joint (11) to secure panels (12, 13) together, a rivet or slug (10) is driven into the clinched joint (11) as it is formed, and the inner end of the rivet or slug (10) is outwardly-deformed to increase both the shear and axial separation load strengths of the clinched joint (11). Rings (410) or components (510, 610), which may form parts of sub-assemblies, may also be secured to the pannels (412, 413; 512, 513; 612, 613) by the clinching methods, the rings (410) or components (510, 610) acting as the dies for the joints (411, 511, 611).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved panel clinching
methods. The term "clinching" is also known as
"press joining" or "integral fastening".Spot welding is the most commonly used technique
for joining vehicle body components in the automotive
industries. As the strength of each spot weld
cannot be guaranteed, eg. due to the inclusion of rubbish
between the components, or poor weld penetration,
designers must increase the number of welds to
ensure adequate joint strength.Spot welding has not yet been developed as an
accurate, reliable method for joining galvanised steel or
aluminium components.With galvanised steel, welding action destroys
the galvanising about the weld site, making it liable to
corrosion.Aluminium has great potential in the automobile
field due to its light weight, but the lack of a suitable
spot welding method is one reason which has minimised
its application.One alternative to spot welding is the use of
self-piercing rivets, and a method of, and apparatus for,
the fastening of metal panels with self-piercing rivets is
disclosed in US Patent No 4,615,475 (Fuhrmeister) (=
International Publication Number WO 84/04710).A further alternative method is metal clinching,
where two sheets of metal are deformed into a locking
engagement using a punch-and-die combination.
Examples of metal clinching methods are disclosed in:
1. DE 4009813 (Fraunhoffer-Ges Ford Ange);2. DE 1452820 (Philips Patentverwaltung GmbH);3. DE 3726392 (Kuka Schweissanlage);4. EP 330061 (Eckold W. & Co GmbH);5. EP 215449 (Rapp E.);6. GB 2244946 (Fairacre Limited);7. GB 2123734 (BTM Corporation);8. US 391995 (Du Vernay); and9. US 387599 (Ladouceur et al).While these methods enable metal sheets to
be jointed together, they have relatively low shear and
axial load strengths, and the joints do not have an outer
face substantially flush with the surrounding sheet metal
(and are so not applicable in exposed areas, eg. within
an engine compartment).It is an object of the present invention to provide
a panel clinching method where the shear
strengths of the clinching joint is increased.It is a preferred object to provide a method
where the axial load strength of the clinched joint is
increased.It is a further preferred object to provide a
method where the outer face of the joint may be substantially
flush with the surrounding sheet metal.It is a still further preferred object to provide a
method where ancillary components may be supported
by or from the clinched joint.It is a still further preferred object to provide a
method where

<CLAIMS>
A panel clinching method for clinching together at least two panels (12, 13),
wherein a tubular rivet or slug is driven or inserted by a punch assembly (20,21) into a

clinched joint (11) between the panels (12,13) to deform the panels (12, 13) being
joined into a supporting die (14) wherein the rivet or slug co-operates with the

punch assembly to deform the panels (12, 13), 
characterised in that
 the punch
assembly comprises a punch (20) and a sleeve (21) external to the punch (20),

the punch (20) is driven through the rivet or slug (10) into engagement
with the upper panel (12), the punch and rivet are advanced to

deform the panel (12, 13), and
the sleeve is advanced relative to the punch (20) to deform at least an inner end of

a shank of the rivet or slug (10) outwardly within the clinched joint (11) and 
in
that
 the rivet or slug (10) does not penetrate the panels (12, 13).
A panel clinching method according to claim 1, wherein the panels to be joined
are pre-clamped to the die (14) before the punch assembly (20, 21) drives the rivet

or slug (10) into the panels (12, 13) to form the clinched joint (11).
A panel clinching method according to any preceding claim, wherein at least one
panel is a metal sheet and at least one panel is a polymeric sheet, the polymeric

sheet being pre-heated in the zone of the clinched joint to encourage the flow of
the polymeric material as the panels are deformed.
A panel clinching method according to any preceding claim, wherein an adhesive
is applied to the ri
vet or slug (10) to assist bonding between the panels (12, 13)
and the rivet or slug (10).
A panel clinching method according to claim 1, wherein an adhesive is applied to
a bore of the tubular rivet or slug (10), the adhesive being extruded into the

clinched joint (11) when the tubular rivet or slug (10) is deformed to assist
bonding between the panels (12, 13) and the rivet or slug (10). 
A panel clinching method according to any preceding claim, wherein the rivet or
slug (10) has a shank with external splines, grooves, teeth or other protrusions or

recesses to provide additional grip between the rivet or slug (10) and the panels in
