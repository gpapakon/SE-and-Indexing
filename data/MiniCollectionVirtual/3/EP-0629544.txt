Parking stand for two-wheel vehicles, in particular bicycles, comprising a 
downwards pointing support element (6, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3) secured to the frame of the 

bicycle, and a support device (8, 8/1 - 8/10) secured to the ground, wherein the 
support element and the support device can be brought into engagement with a 

bicycle standing on the ground with at least one wheel, characterised in that the 
support element (6, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3) comprises an essentially vertical, rod-shaped, 

plate-shaped or stirrup-shaped support member (7, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3), and in that the 
support device (8, 8/1 to 8/10) is provided with at least one essentially vertical 

mounting pipe (11, 11/1 to 11/11) which is open at the top, into which the support 
member (8, 8/1, to 8/10) can be inserted directly from the top fitting with a small 

amount of play, so that the mounting pipe (11, 11/1 to 11/11) surrounds the 
support member (8, 8/1 to 8/10) horizontally on all sides. 
Parking stand according to claim 1, characterised in that the support member (7/2) 
in the form of a support pin (14/2) is mounted on the support element (6/2) able to 

be pivoted by about 5° in both directions from its vertical position about a pivotal 
axis (28) at right angles to the vertical bicycle longitudinal middle plane (19/1), 

and in that the support pin (14/2) can be secured in its respective pivotal position 
as desired. 
Parking stand according to claim 1, characterised in that the support member (7/3) 
is designed as a support plate (39), which is oriented vertically downwards and 

runs parallel to the vertical bicycle longitudinal middle plane (19/3), in that the 
front and rear edge (40 and 41) of the support plate (39) running towards one 

another from the top to the bottom form an angle β
1
 or β
2
 of about 5° respectively 
to the vertical support plate middle plane (38) and in that the mounting pipe (11/3) 

has a longitudinal cross sectional form corresponding to the support plate cross 
section.  

 
Parking stand according to claim 3, characterised in that the support plate (39) 
with its support plate longitudinal middle plane (39') is arranged laterally off-set 

relative to the bicycle longitudinal middle plane (19/3) by a value B
v
, which 
corresponds to a maximum of half the frame pipe width B/2. 
Parking stand according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
mounting pipe (11/4) and the support device (8/4) form a single standing pipe 

which is anchored securely underground (44). 
Parking stand according to claim 4, characterised in that the support device (8, 
8/1) is provided at its bottom end with a standing plate (9, 9/1) which can be 

secured to the ground. 
Parking stand according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the support 
device (8/4) is provided with a safety stirrup (45), a safety chain, a safety loop or a 

safety ring to which a bicycle (1, 1/1 to 1/7) can be connected in a thief-proof 
manner. 
Parking stand according to one of claims 1 to 3 or 6, characterised in that the 
support device (8/5 to 8/8) comprises a U-shaped pipe frame (46, 50, 58) which is 

anchored securely with its vertical U-arms (47, 48; 51, 52) to the ground. 
Parking stand according to one of claims 1 to 3 or 6, characterised in that the U-arms 
(47, 48; 51, 52) are provided at their respective bottom end with a standing 

plate which can be secured to the ground. 
Parking stand according to claim 7, characterised in that the pipe frame (46) on its 
support pipe (49) running horizontally between the U-arms (47, 48) has several 

spaced apart mounting pipes (11/5) arranged in a vertical middle plane all 
mounted on the pipe frame (46).  

 
Parking stand according to claim 7, characterised in that on at least one of the U-arms 
(51, 52; 56, 57) of the pipe frame (50, 55) in the vertical middle plane of the 

mounting frame (50, 55) a mounting pipe (11/6, 11/7) is arranged in lateral 
distance to the respective U-arm (51, 52; 56, 57). 
Parking stand according to claim 7, characterised in that to the U-arms (51, 52) 
and/or the support pipe (59) respectively mounting pipes (11/6, 11/8) are 

arranged in vertical distance to the vertical middle plane (60) of the pipe frame 
(50, 58) and in lateral distance from one another.
