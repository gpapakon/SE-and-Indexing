<ABSTRACT>
A method of assembling top shells (26) onto 
the links (18) of a flexible linkage, the top shells (26) 

being configured and dimensioned to 
overlie the links and having bendable end tabs (34). The 

method comprises the steps of (26):
 

   forming an elongated framework which includes a plurality of the top shells 
arranged in an integrally interconnected parallel array;

 
   combining a section of the linkage with the top shell framework in a manner such 

that the links are aligned with the top shells (26); and
 

   subdividing the framework 
to separate the top shells (26) one from the other in 

connection with the deformation of the end tabs (34) around and into 
mechanical interengagement with the ends of the links to thereby secure 

the top shells (26) to the links (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to flexible linkages of the type employed in watchbands, 
and is concerned in particular with an improved method of forming and mounting top shells onto 
the links of such linkages. The invention is particularly suited for, although not limited in use to, the mounting of 
molded plastic top shells onto the top links of metallic expansible watchband linkages. The 
conventional expansible watchband typically includes a row of top links overlying a row of 
bottom links. The top links have hollow box-like configurations with open ends. Each bottom 
link is connected to two adjacent top links by pairs of U-shaped staples. Springs housed in the 
links coact with the staples to yieldably contract the band. The top and bottom links as well as 
the staples and springs are typically fabricated as metal stampings. Top shells, also typically 
fabricated as metal stampings, are applied to the top links to impart the desired ornamental 
appearance to the finished product. Because of their relatively thin-walled constructions, stamped metallic top shells 
contribute only minimally to the overall weight of the finished product. In some cases, this has 
led to expansible watchbands being compared unfavorably to more expensive non-expansible 
bands. which characteristically rely on thicker and heavier links, usually produced as castings 
or machined components. During the assembly process, the stamped metallic top shells are conventionally batch  
 
loaded into vibrating hoppers, from which they are fed along tracks to a work station for 
application separately to individual top links of the expansible band. As a result of rubbing 
against one another in the vibrating hoppers, as well as against the guide surfaces of the feed 
tracks, the metallic top shells inevitably experience surface scratching. However, this is of little 
practical import because the top shells must in any event undergo expensive post assembly 
polishing to remove stretch marks which inevitably result from their origination as three 
dimensional stampings from flat sheet stock. The stamped metallic top shells also require precise orientation and alignment preparatory 
to being applied separately to individual top links. The complexities involved in doing so on a 
mass production scale make it difficult and in most cases impractical to apply more than two top 
shell designs to a particular band. Recent developments in expansible watchband technology have demonstrated the 
feasibility of substituting non-metallic top
