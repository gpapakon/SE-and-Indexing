<ABSTRACT>
To provide the possibility of mobile communication even in private telephone branch exchanges, it is known to supplement private branch exchanges with a switching subsystem or with a control unit for the radio network and to connect to this base stations by which cordless telephones have access to the private branch exchange. It is the object of the invention to specify an interface arrangement between private branch exchange and base station, in such a manner that the expenditure for the base stations existing in large number becomes low. For this purpose, an interface which is microprocessor-controlled with the private branch exchange, maintaining the DECT standard, is specified which shifts the majority of functions from the base stations to the private branch exchange. An especially inexpensive solution is achieved by multiple utilisation of modules and dynamic channel allocation.
