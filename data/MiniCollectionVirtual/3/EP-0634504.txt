<ABSTRACT>
The process involves generating a molten phase of a semiconductor material, which phase overlies a solid phase of the material and has a free surface which is situated opposite said solid phase and into which energy is radiated during the crystallisation process and material is fed in the form of granules, which floats and is melted. This results in the overgrowth of material, at the interface solid/ liquid situated opposite, of material onto the solid phase which is drawn off in a downward direction in accordance with the overgrowth rate. The process can be used to obtain mono- or multicrystalline rods or ingots. The main advantages of the process are that the operation does not require melting vessels, it is possible to use granules, and the energy balance is favourable owing to the small quantities of melt.
