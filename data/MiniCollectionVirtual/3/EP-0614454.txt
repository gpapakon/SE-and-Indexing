<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR INHIBITING FOULANT FORMATIONField of the InventionThe invention relates to a method for inhibiting formation of foulants in a substantially non-aqueous organic process stream by the addition of one or more of certain oxime compounds. Background of the InventionIn a wide variety of applications wherein organic compounds are used or processed, one must be concerned about the occurrence of fouling in the processing equipment. Fouling in an organic stream o system occurs as a result of polymerization or other reaction of at least a portion of the organic compo¬ nents in the stream or system to form a higher molecu¬ lar weight product having reduced solubility in the organic components. The reduced solubility causes the higher molecular weight product, i.e., the foulant, to separate from the organic components and clog or obstruct transfer lines, settle out from the compo¬ nents, and otherwise coat the surfaces of the proces- sing equipment. The formation of undesirable foulants 

 occurs in process streams having only organic as well as both organic and aqueous phases. The aqueous phase may be merely water entrained in the organic stream during processing, but also includes the water added to quench or cool a reaction or to remove certain water soluble components from the organic stream by a process step, such as steam stripping. Where water is present in the organic stream, the presence of water- soluble dissolved materials which may catalyze or enhance polymerization or other reaction must be considered.Reaction occurs because the organic com¬ pounds are subjected to conditions sufficient to cause modification of the chemical structure of one or more of the organic components of the stream or system. Conditions which affect reactivity include tempera¬ ture, pressure, pH and presence of trace metals and other contaminants. For example, it is known that in the process of thermally cracking a feedstock blend of naphtha and gas oil to produce short chain thermal cracking products such as ethylene, propylene, ethane, treated pyrolysis gasoline and various mixed hydro¬ carbon streams, the existing processing temperatures, pressures and presence of trace contaminants cause further reaction of one or more of the thermal cracking products to create oligomers, polymers and 

 oxidized products which are capable of fouling the processing equipment.The secondary reaction products formed in process streams such as that described above are undesirable for several reasons. First, if the secondary reaction
