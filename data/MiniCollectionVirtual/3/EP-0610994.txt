<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed of obtaining from an 
imagewise exposed photographic element separate records 

of the imagewise exposure to each of the blue, green 
and red portions of the spectrum comprising 

photographically processing an imagewise exposed 
photographic element comprised of a sequence of 

superimposed blue, green and red recording silver 
halide emulsion layer units that produce images of 

substantially the same hue upon processing. A first 
interlayer unit overlies the emulsion layer unit 

nearest the support and is capable of transmitting to 
it imagewise exposing radiation this emulsion layer 

unit is intended to record. A second interlayer unit 
underlies the emulsion layer unit farthest from the 

support and is capable of transmitting to the emulsion 
layer units lying nearer the support imagewise exposing 

radiation these emulsion layer units are intended to 
record. The imagewise exposed photographic element is 

photographically processed to produce a silver image in 
each of the emulsion layer units. After photographic 

processing one of the interlayer units is capable of 
absorbing electromagnetic radiation within at least one 

wavelength region and emitting within a longer 
wavelength region, and the remaining of the first and 

second interlayer units is capable of reflecting or 
absorbing electromagnetic radiation within at least one 

wavelength region. The photographic element is scanned 
utilizing emission from one of the interlayer units to  

 
provide a first record containing image information in 

one of the emulsion layer units and is scanned 
utilizing reflection or absorption of the remaining 

interlayer unit to provide a second record containing 
image information in another of the emulsion layer 

units. Additionally, the photographic element is 
scanned through the first and second interlayer units 

and all of the emulsion layer units to provide a 
spectrally undifferentiated third record of the 

combined images in all of the emulsion layer units. 
The first, second and third records are compared to 

obtain separate blue, green and red exposure records.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a method of 
extracting blue, green and red exposure records from an 
imagewise exposed silver halide photographic element 
and to a photographic element particularly adapted for 
use in the method. In classical black-and-white photography a 
photographic element containing a silver halide 
emulsion layer coated on a transparent film support is 
imagewise exposed to light, producing a latent image 
within the emulsion layer. The film is then 
photographically processed to transform the latent 
image into a silver image that is a negative image of 
the subject photographed. Photographic processing 
involves developing (reducing silver halide grains 
containing latent image sites to silver), stopping 
development, and fixing (dissolving undeveloped silver 
halide grains). The resulting processed photographic 
element, commonly referred to as a negative, is placed 
between a uniform exposure light source and a second 
photographic element, commonly referred to as a 
photographic paper, containing a silver halide emulsion 
layer coated on a white paper support. Exposure of the 
emulsion layer of the photographic paper through the 
negative produces a latent image in the photographic 
paper that is a positive image of the subject 
originally photographed. Photographic processing of 
the photographic paper produces a positive silver 
image. The image bearing photographic paper is 
commonly referred to as a print.  
 In classical color photography in its most 
widely used form the photographic film contains three 
superimposed silver halide emulsion layer units each 
containing a different subtractive primary dye or dye 
precursor, one for recording blue light (i.e., blue) 
exposure and forming a yellow dye image, one for 
recording green exposure and forming a magenta dye 
image, and one for recording red exposure and forming a 
cyan dye image. During photographic processing 
developing agent is oxidized in the course of reducing 
latent image containing silver halide grains to silver, 
and the oxidized developing agent is employed to form 
the dye image, usually by reacting (coupling) with a 
dye precursor (a dye-forming coupler). Undeveloped 
silver halide is removed by fixing and the unwanted 
developed silver image is removed by bleaching during 
photographic processing. This approach is most 
commonly used to produce negative dye images (i.e., 
blue, green and red subject features appear yellow, 
magenta and cyan, respectively). Exposure of color 
paper through the color
