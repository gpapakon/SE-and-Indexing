<ABSTRACT>
A container with removable modular elements, in particular for 
containing cosmetics or other products, comprising a lower base 

part (11) and an upper cover part (12) connected together by a 
hinge formed from a pin (13) rigid with a first of said two parts 

(11, 12) and a freely removable snap-positionable connection 
element (15, 16) allowing it to rotate rigidly with the other of 

the two parts (12, 11). A modular insert element (21) provided 
with a mirror can be housed within said upper part (12) and be 

snap positioned by means of a freely removable connection element 
(24, 25) which enables it to rotate, and by means of at least one 

portion (26) of the insert element (21) which is inserted into a 
seat (20) in the upper part (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a container with removable modular
elements, particularly for containing cosmetics products.Currently used containers consist of a lower part and an upper
part connected together by a hinge provided within a narrow region
of the two parts, so as to form a containing box element.Containers of this type generally contain cosmetics products such
as eye shadow, blusher, face powder, lipstick and the like; and
possibly other products not of cosmetics type.These products are all either located directly in a seat in the
container, usually provided in its lower part, or in an
interchangeable insert element housable in the same seat.In this case the insert element has to be both easily positionable
in and easily removable from its seat, for example by having snap-coupling
elements associated with it.An example of such a container is the subject of the patent DE-A-42
13 239.In addition the upper part of the container usually carries, fixed
rigidly thereto for example by adhesive, a mirror which can be
used both as an aid when applying cosmetics products and for any 
other purpose.In the case of a transparent container the positioning of the
mirror hinders the view of the product and/or of its colour within
the container, or the product may be able to be only partly seen
from the outside. In addition the glued region of the mirror is
visible, so detracting from the overall appearance.With containers of this type, as collection of refuse on a sorted
basis becomes increasingly more widespread, the mirror must
firstly be removed before disposing of the consumed container.This also applies if plastics containers are to be salvaged for
recycling with an aim to totally satisfy all ecological problems
connected with poorly degradable materials.An object of the invention is to obviate the aforesaid drawbacks
by providing a container which can receive any type of insert and
internally hold a mirror, while at the same time being
structurally simple, of low cost and of easy construction.A further object is to provide a container satisfying all
ecological requirements or regulations, so allowing differential
salvaging of its materials.These objects are attained by a container having the
characteristics described in the accompanying claims.The structural and functional characteristics of the invention and
its advantages compared with the known art will be more apparent
from the following description, given with reference to the
accompanying drawings which show one embodiment of a container
incorporatin
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container with removable inserted elements, in
particular for containing cosmetics or other products,

comprising a lower base part (11) and an upper cover
part (12) connected together by a hinge formed from a

pin (13) rigid with said lower base part (11) and a
snap-positionable connection element (15,16) allowing

the upper cover part to rotate about said pin
(13) and to be freely removable

therefrom, characterised by an insert element (21)
provided with a mirror for being housed within said

upper part (12) and being snap-positionable by means of
a connection element (24,25) which freely removably

connects with the said pin (13) and enables the said
insert to rotate relative thereto, and by means of at

least one portion (26) of said insert element (21)
which is insertable into a seat (20) in said upper part

(12). 
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
said connection element for said insert element (21) provided with

a mirror consists of an appendix (24) with an intermediate recess (25)
positionable on said pin (13).
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
said connection element for said upper part comprises two spaced-apart

pairs of downwardly projecting appendices (15) defining
elastically yieldable facing arms (15a, 15b).
A container as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that
between said facing arms (15a, 15b) there is a widening recess

(16).
A container as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that
said two pairs of appendices (15) extend from said upper part (12)

and receive said freely removably connectable connection element (24, 25) for 
said insert element (21) between them.
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
said seat (20) consists of a step-shaped recess provided on the

opposite side to said hinge.
