<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to preparations for the improved release of oxygen into the skin and to the use of same as cosmetics/dermatics. The preparations according to this invention contain, as the essential component, fluorocarbon emulsions consisting of nonionic emulsifiers and an oxygen-loaded fluorocarbon or fluorocarbon mixture, the fluorocarbon content being in the range from 0.05 to 100 % by weight/volume. They are prepared by emulsifiying the corresponding components and incorporating the resulting emulsion in known carriers for, for example, ointments, creams, lotions, waters, alcoholic extracts, pastes, powders, gels, tinctures or masks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cosmetic and dermatological
preparations which are efficient in improving the
oxygen supply to the skin.To improve supply of oxygen to the skin, it has
already been proposed to use peroxides, such as hydrogen
peroxide, in order to stimulate the cell metabolism of
the skin via the nascent oxygen formed. However, the
considerable side effects, such as skin irritations, have
prevented their use. DE-A-2,534,315 claims an
O2-containing cosmetological formulation composed of an
O2-saturated gaseous fluorocarbon and a surfactant in
aqueous phase in an aerosol container. Borgarello
(EP-A-296,661) has developed an isotropic single-phase
system for the cosmetic sector in which halogenated
compounds are supposed to act as oxygen carriers. A
typical composition consists of 34% of a mixture of
perchloro-1-butyltetrahydrofuran and polyfluoro-1-propyltetrahydrofuran,
7% of isopropanol, 49% of water and 10%
of emulsifier. The emulsifiers used are highly surface-active
fluorine surfactants, for example of the
perfluoroalkanesulfonamide type, which are known to be
extremely toxic on i.p. application in mice (LD50 0.1 to
0.2 g/kg) and also act as an irritant on the skin.
Further possible solutions relate to the use of a
haemolymph extract from crustaceans or of an extract of
proteins and proteids from bovine spleen. Human
haemoglobin or, more recently, haemoglobin prepared by
biotechnology has hitherto not been available in a form
utilizable for topical purposes. Furthermore, it is known
that PO/EO block polymers having EO contents of up to 50%
have relatively good solubility for gaseous oxygen. It,
contrast, block polymers having EO contents of 60 to 80%
are solid products exhibiting low solubility for oxygen.
WO-A-9100110 refers to fluorocarbon emulsions employing an ionic emulsifying
agent with essentially saturated carbon bounds and their use as blood
substitutes for intravenous use and as emollients for burns. However, so far no convincing and physically
detectable toning and reviving of the skin surface could
be achieved by means of the preparations and methods
mentioned.The object of the invention is to improve the
oxygen supply to the skin by means of a specific preparation
based on a suitable emulsion of fluorocarbons in
such a manner that a detectable effect is achieved.According to the invention, the preparation,
selected from the group consisting of a powder, a lotion, a
shampoo, a cream or a gel paste,
consists of an aqueous emulsion having a nonionic surfactant
content of 1 to 8% by
