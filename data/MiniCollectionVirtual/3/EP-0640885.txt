<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a charging device, and more particularly to a charging device
for providing a potential on an image receptor.In a typical xerographic charging system, the amount of voltage obtained at the
point of electrostatic voltage (ESV) measurement of the photoconductive member is less than
the amount of voltage applied at the point of charge application. In addition, the amount of
voltage applied to the corona generator required to obtain a desired constant voltage on the
photoconductive member must be increased or decreased according to various factors which
affect the photoconductive member. Such factors include the rest time of the photoconductive
member between printing, the voltage applied to the corona generator for the previous
printing job, the copy length of the previous printing job, machine to machine variance, the
age of the photoconductive member and changes in the environment.Historically, the only factor corrected in applying a voltage on the corona generator
to obtain a uniform voltage at the photoconductive member was a rest recovery correction
factor. The rest recovery factor attempted to correct for the fact that the photoreceptor
responds to charges differently after it is allowed to rest at which time no charge is applied.
Preferably, the manner of adjusting the voltage at the corona generator was to adjust the
voltage applied to the wire grid.The problems with typical xerographic charging control systems are not limited to
the difficulties associated with rest recovery. In a typical charge control system
as known from US-A-4 355 885,
the point of
charge application, and the point of charge measurement is different. The zone between these
two devices loses the immediate benefit of charge control decisions based on measured voltage
error since this zone is downstream from the charging device. This zone may be as great as a
belt revolution or more due to charge averaging schemes. This problem is especially evident in
aged photoreceptors because their cycle-to-cycle charging characteristics are more difficult to
predict. The problem results in improper charging, often leading to early photoreceptor
replacement. Thus, there is a need to anticipate what the next cycles behavior will be and
compensate for it beforehand.Other difficulties with typical xerographic charging control systems are the
calculation and communication requirements placed on a central or main controller. The main
controller is often burdened with general process control, diagnostic, and
