<ABSTRACT>
The column redundancy device for a memory has a memory blocks (BK1... N), with memory cells arranged in x rows and y columns, redundant memory cells, which are arranged in b rows and c columns, a column decoder (CDEC) with c redundant column decoders (RCD1 ... N), and d coding elements (CF1,1 ... CFP,4). Each column decoder (RCD1 ... 4) is assigned to one of the c redundant columns of each memory block (BK1 ... N). Each of the d coding elements (CF1,1 ... CFP,4) includes means of decoding addresses, and can thus be assigned to any memory block (BK1... N).
