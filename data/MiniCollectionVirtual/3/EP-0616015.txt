<ABSTRACT>
HVAC systems having interior surfaces exposed to moist air are 
protected against fungal growth by coating the interior surfaces with an adherent 

flexible polymer film which includes a fungicidal composition in an amount 
effective to provide a zone of inhibition against multiple fungal species of at 

least 1 mm, and which employs active fungicidal ingredients which are 
substantially non-volatile and non-soluble in water. Suitably the film is formed 

by application of a latex coating formulation, free of arsenic, mercury, lead, tin, 
chlorine or bromine, the formulation comprising an emulsion of a flexible 

polymer having suspended therein a mixture of fungicides, the fungicide mixture 
including a barium metaborate fungicide and a second fungicide selected from 

the group consisting of iodo alkynyl alkyl carbamates, diidomethyl-

<DESCRIPTION>
Fungicides are common ingredients in paint formulations where
they are used to provide protection against mold and mildew growth in latex
paint formulations and against attack by such organisms feeding on paint film
polymers. Typically the effects of such fungicides in paint films are limited to
the immediate surface of the film.In US 3,549,762 there is described an alkyd paint formulation
which employs 2,4-dicyanotrichloropyridine as a biocide and which exhibits a
zone of inhibition beyond the surface of the paint film in which a fungal species
would not grow.Air handling equipment is used in all types of buildings for
heating ventilating and air conditioning. This air handling equipment circulates
air throughout the whole building on a continual basis. As air moves through
the system, it carries with it suspended matter that gets deposited in the duct
work, and builds up over time. This build-up can be dust, dirt, or grease and
volatile food components from food preparation areas. Greasy substances are a
particular problem, as they tend to adhere to the interior surface of the air
handling equipment. Under the right conditions, this build-up can be the
breeding ground for various fungus or bacteria, giving rise for some odor
problems and possible serious health problems. A particularly serious problem
exists when mold, bacteria or fungus is present in an isolated part of the
building, and because of the air circulation system, it is distributed throughout
the whole building. This is a special concern in hospitals and health care
centers, as well as buildings with commercial kitchens. There are reported
known instances where disease has been spread to occupants in a building
through the air handling equipment.Air handling equipment requires periodic cleaning operations in
order to clean the interior surfaces as well as sanitize them with special
sanitizing solutions. In some cases the equipment is actually broken into and
cleaned by hand or by self-propelled moving carts that scrub the surfaces as they 
move through the duct work. Sanitizing solution may be fogged into one of the
air inlets, with fogging continuing until a cheese cloth draped over all of the
ventilators becomes wet with the fogging solution, indicating the solution has
moved throughout the entire duct work. This method does not remove any
matter, but only attempts to kill off any fungal or bacterial growth.Treatment of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
systems to control mold spores is the subject of US Patent 3,591,328.
