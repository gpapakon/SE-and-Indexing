<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic 
light-sensitive material and, particularly to a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material for regular-type X-ray 
photographic use, that is suitable for rapid development 
process. In recent years, a high-temperature and rapid-processing 
has become feasible because of the introduction of an 
automatic processor, and a super-rapid processing for not 
longer than 45 seconds in a Dry-to-Dry system has been 
developed. In this type of systems, on the other hand, it has 
been customary to make a hardening reaction in the course of 
the processing steps, for providing a rapid processing 
aptitude. Conventionally, glutaraldehyde has been used as a 
hardener, because of a high reactivity and a rapid hardening  
 
in a developer. However, it has not been admittable that 
glutaraldehyde is high in safety, because it has an irritating 
odor, or if it adheres to a human body. Further, with raising 
the issue of environmental protection, a rapid processing 
procedure has been so developed as to eliminate a hardening 
development in which glutaraldehyde is used. For performing a rapid photographic processing without 
relying on such a hardening development as mentioned above, a 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material is 
required to be satisfactorily hardened in advance. However, 
in the case of a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material for medical use that is required to have a high 
sensitivity and a high density (Dmax) and if the light-sensitive 
material is satisfactorily hardened in advance, a 
large amount of silver coated is required to provide desired 
photographic characteristics. An increase in silver coverage 
brings about, not only increased costs is increased, but also 
such a serious trouble as a lowering of rapid processability, 
an increase of fog and the deterioration of pressure 
resistance. In recent years, in a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material for medical use, there have increased the 
transfer from a regular system to an ortho system combined 
with a rare-earth screen. In the latter system, a tabular 
silver halide emulsion has been used, because a large amount 
of ortho-sensitizing dyes can be adsorbed thereto; a high  
 
density can be obtained by a relatively small amount of silver 
coverage; a density-down is relatively small even when 
sufficiently hardened in advance; and desired photographic 
characteristics can be obtained even without further 
hardening. The facts mentioned
