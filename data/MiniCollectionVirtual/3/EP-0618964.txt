 NOVEL TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR VARIANTSCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis is a continuing application under 35 U.S.C. 120/121 of application Serial Number 07/808,537, filed 16 December 1991 and of application Serial Number 07/741,120, filed 5 August 1991, now U.S. Patent 5147643, and of application Serial Number 07/522,480 filed 11 May 1990, now U.S. Patent 5073494, which is a continuing application of Serial Number 07/186,494 filed 26 April 1988, abandoned, which is a continuing application of Serial Number 07/071,506 filed 9 July 1987, abandoned, Serial Number 06/846,697 filed 1 April 1986, abandoned, and Serial Number 06/725, 468 filed 22 April 1985, abandoned.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to particular novel variants of tissue, plasminogen activator (t-PA) . These variants, although embraced generically by earlier disclosure, as noted infra. are novel, specific derivatives which exhibit activities which defied prediction from the prior research of others on the basic tissue plasminogen activator molecule or the model serine proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin.As the preferred embodiment herein contemplates the preparation of such variants via recombinant DNA technology, the present invention likewise encompasses the associated 

 compounds and means involved in such technology, namely, DNA * isolates encoding such variants, expression vectors, transfected host cells and processes for making and using each of them. The novel variants hereof have unexpectedly enhanced fibrin specificity.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPlasminogen activators are enzymes that activate the zymogen plasminogen to generate the serine proteinase plasmin (by cleavage at Arg561-Val562) that degrades various proteins, including fibrin. Among the plasminogen activators studied are streptokinase, a bacterial protein, urokinase, an enzyme synthesized in the kidney and elsewhere and originally extracted from urine, and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) , an enzyme produced by the cells lining blood vessel walls.The mechanism of action of each of these plasminogen activators differs: Streptokinase forms a complex with plasminogen or plasmin, generating plasminogen-activating activity, urokinase cleaves plasminogen directly, and t-PA requires fibrin to yield maximum plasminogen activating activity.t-PA has been identified and described as a particularly important and potent new biological pharmaceutical agent that has shown extraordinary results in the treatment of vascular diseases, such as
