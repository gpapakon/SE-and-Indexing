<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a control system for metering the fuel supply to an internal combustion engine. Depending on the starting temperature, time values TVO and threshold values are predetermined preferably for the engine temperature when idling (XOLL) and when non-idling (XONLL). In a preferred embodiment, after a time depending on the starting temperature, an interrogation is made whether the engine temperature has already reached values which correspond to the stored threshold values for idling and non-idling and, depending upon the response, a changeover is made from control to regulation operation of the lambda regulator.

Control system of an internal combustion engine
for metering fuel as a function of characteristic

operating variables such as load, rotational speed and
temperature, having means for regulating the metering of

fuel as a function of the output signal of a probe
located in the exhaust gas manifold of the internal

combustion engine and having means for switching over
between open-loop and closed-loop control mode as a

function of a characteristic operating variable which is
set to the start time as a function of the temperature of

the internal combustion engine, characterized in that the
characteristic operating variable is a time period,

and/or in that the characteristic operating variable is
a threshold value for at least one of the following

variables:

the number of ignitions which have taken place since
the start,
the sum of the mass air flow rate or a volume air
flow rate sucked in since the start,
the sum of the fuel mass fed in since the start, in
particular the sum of the injection times which have

been output,
the integral of the throttle-valve angle,
the integral of the intake manifold pressure,
the value of the exhaust gas temperature,
the value of the temperature of the catalytic
converter.
Control system according to Claim 1,
characterized in that up to the time when the closed-loop 

control mode is switched on, at least one of the
following measures is taken:


the reference idling speed is increased,
the resumption speed for the enabling of the fuel
supply after the fuel is switched off under overrun

conditions is increased,
the ignition is adjusted in the late direction.
Control system according to at least one of
Claims 1 - 2, characterized in that in conjunction with

the transition to closed-loop control mode, at least one
of the following measures comes into effect:


the warming-up enrichment factor is reduced over a
ramp as a function of time and/or ignition,
the start of closed-loop control is delayed until
the secondary air supply is switched off.
Control system according to at least one of
Claims 1 - 3, characterized in that the prescribable time

period is selected to be smaller as the temperature of
the internal combustion engine rises up to the start

time.
Control system according to at least one of
Claims 1 - 4, characterized in that different threshold

values at least for two different load states are
selected for the variable characterizing the operating

period of the internal combustion engine, and in that, in
addition, the system is switched over from open-loop

control to closed-loop control if the characterizing
variable in the load state at that time has reached the

load-dependent threshold value and/or the prescribable
time period has expired.
