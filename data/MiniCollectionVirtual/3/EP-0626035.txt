<ABSTRACT>
For a valve control (26) of an internal combustion engine shown in Fig. 3, in which a camshaft (29) with control cam (30, 31) acts on a valve (27, 28) via a transmission element (33), the position of the contact path (32') of which on the cam side can be altered in relation to the control cam (30, 31) by means of a control device (41) to change the valve opening time for a substantially constant valve travel conditioned by the system, in order to achieve precise control it is proposed that the contact path (32') be formed on a roller (32) compulsorily controlled relatively to the push rod (33) in synchronism with the camshaft (29) as an intermediate component between the control cam (30, 31) and the push rod (33).

A valve control system for an internal combustion engine 

wherein a control cam (3, 17, 30, 31) on a camshaft (2, 18, 29) acts 
via an intermediate element (6, 22, 32) and a tr
ansmission member 
(5, 20, 33) on a gas change valve (27, 28) so as to bring about the 

stroke, wherein 
the intermediate element (6, 22, 32) is disposed so as to be driven in 
motion via a contact path (4, 19, 32') acted upon by the control cam 

(3, 17, 30, 31) during each valve stroke relative to the rotating

camshaft (2), wherein

stroke direction, 
a connecting rod (24) of a crank or eccentric drive (25) of the control 
device and having an adjustable angle of rotation and rotating in 

synchronism with the camshaft (18) pivotably engages the control 
arm, and
