<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for supporting the step chain of an 
escalator having a frame with a first and a second 

landing, an inclined section attached therebetween, and 
roller tracks fixed thereto, is provided. The apparatus 

comprises a pair of arcuate ramps for supporting the 
step chain in a transition area between either of the 

landings and the inclined section, which ramps are 
positioned inboard of said roller tracks. Each of the 

ramps comprises a first bushing, a second bushing, and 
an elastomeric center section attached to the bushings. 

The invention also provides an escalator provided with 
such a support apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to escalators
driven by step chains.Escalators are a known method for conveying people
from a first elevation to a second elevation.
Typically, an escalator includes a frame, a drive, a
step chain and a pair of balustrade assemblies. The
frame comprises a truss section on both the left and
right hand sides of the frame. Each truss section has
two end sections forming landings, connected by an
inclined midsection. Matching pairs of roller tracks
are attached on the inside of each truss section, i.e.
the side of the truss section facing the other truss
section. The upper landing usually houses the escalator
drive between the trusses. The drive powers a pair of
step chain sprockets, which in turn impart motion to the
step chain. The step chain travels a closed loop,
running from one elevation to the other elevation, and
back.Step chains typically consist of a pair of chain
strands connected by a plurality of axles, each axle
having a pair of rollers which contact the roller
tracks. The chain strands are attached to the axle
inside of the rollers. Each strand is formed from a
plurality of chain links. Each link has a pair of side
plates spaced apart from one another, pivotably attached
to the side plates of the adjacent links of the strand.
This link arrangement is repeated as many times as is
necessary to arrive at the length strand, and therefore
the length chain desired. The axles connect every "nth"
link in one of the strands to the aligned link in the
other strand. Connecting the strands with the axles
ties the two independent strands into a single step
chain. The load on each step chain axle may be described
as having two main components: the load on the attached
treadplate and the load transferred through the attached
chain strands. The load attributable to the attached
treadplate is simply the weight of the treadplate and
whatever load is on that treadplate. The axle receives
this load where the treadplate is attached to the axle,
inboard of the rollers. The load attributable to the
attached chain strands, on the other hand, is a function
of the step chain sprockets pulling the chain, and
therefore includes a percentage of all of the
individually loaded treadplates, along the inclined
midsection. Both of these loads on the step chain axle
are transferred to the rollers attached to the axles,
outboard of the chain strands. Each axle, therefore,
can be viewed as a beam simply supported at each end by
a roller. The chain strands and the attached steps,
both inboard of the

<CLAIMS>
A step chain support apparatus (10), for an
escalator (14) having a frame (16) with a first landing

(31), a second landing (33), and an inclined section
(26) attached therebetween, a step chain (12) for travel

along a predetermined path, having a plurality of axles
(36) with rollers (38), and a pair of roller tracks for

supporting the step chain along the path, comprising:

a pair of arcuate ramps (48,50) for supporting the
step chain (12) in a transition area (46) between either

of said landings (31,33) and said inclined section (26),
inboard of the roller tracks, wherein each of said ramps

(48,50) comprises a first bushing (54), a second bushing
(56), and an elastomeric center section (58) attached to

said bushings, said elastomeric centre section (58)
being disposed radially inwardly of said first bushing

(54) and radially outwardly of said second bushing (56).
Apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising:

bearing means (47) to be rotatably mounted on an
axle (36) of the step chain (12), wherein said arcuate

ramps (48,50) are received by said bearings means (47).
An escalator (14), comprising:

a frame (16), having a first landing (31), a second
landing (33), and an inclined section (26) attached

therebetween;
a step chain (12), having a first strand (34) and a
second strand (34) connected by a plurality of axles

(36), each axle (36) having a pair of rotatably attached
rollers (38), for travel along a predetermined path;
a pair of roller tracks, for supporting said
rollers (38) and therefore said step chain (12) along

said path;
and a step chain support apparatus (10) as claimed
in claim 1.
An escalator according to claim 3, wherein said
step chain support apparatus (10) further comprises

bearings (47) rotatably mounted on said axles (36) for
receiving said arcuate ramps (48,50).
An escalator according to claim 3, wherein:

said first strand (34) has links (40) pivotably
attached to one another, each link (40) comprised of a

first side plate (42) and a second side plate (42)
spaced apart from said first side plate;
said second strand (34) has links (40) pivotably
attached to one another, each link (40) comprised of a

first side plate (42) and a second side plate (42)
spaced apart from said first side plate; and step chain

support apparatus (10) further comprises
