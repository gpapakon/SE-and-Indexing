<CLAIMS>
A method for the bubble-free introduction of 
hydrogen into aqueous liquids, in which the hydrogen is 

introduced into the agueous liquid via a membrane, 
characterised in that a membrane is used comprising a) 

a support structure having an integral-asymmetrical 
structure and microporous layer, formed of porous 

polymer, and b) at least one layer of non-porous 
polymer, the aqueous liquid being in contact with the 

membrane on the side of the layer of non-porous 
polymer. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the support structure of the membrane is formed 

from polyetherimide. 
A method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the non-porous layer consists of 

hydrophobic, non-porous polymer, preferably silicone 
polymer. 
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the non-porous layer has a thickness of 0.1 to 100 

micrometres. 
A method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the membrane is designed as a 

flat membrane, tubular membrane or preferably as a 
hollow filament. 
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the membrane is designed as a hollow filament 

membrane or tubular membrane and the additional layer 
is located on the inside of the membrane.  

 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the aqueous liquid is water containing oxygen, 

nitrite and/or nitrate, in which the content of oxygen, 
nitrite and/or nitrate is to be catalytically reduced 

by the hydrogen which is introduced.
