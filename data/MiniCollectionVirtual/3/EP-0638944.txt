<ABSTRACT>
A vent plug for a lead-acid battery, which plug both prevents the escape of acid mists from the cell and excludes their damaging influence on the functioning of a safety valve, is set up such that as the cell gases force their way to the outside, they first of all pass through a porous frit and afterwards a pressure relief valve. A housing base body or base (receptacle) (1), the lower part of which accommodates the frit (2) and is fixed, by means of a bayonet fitting, in a filling opening of the battery cover (3), is preassembled with a pressure relief valve, comprising a pressure spring (6) and a plate seal (7) with a sealing support (9), and afterwards is undetachably (permanently) connected to a covering cap (8) by clipping the latter onto the outer flange (5) of the base body.
