<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the attachment of a horizontal pipe (1) to a wall, composed of a clamp (2) which encloses the pipe and of an approximately semicylindrical supporting shell (4) which is to be inserted between the pipe (1) and that portion of the pipe clamp (2) located beneath and whose length is a number of times greater than the width of the pipe clamp (2). According to the invention, the supporting shell (4) is provided with perforations (6).

A device for suspending a horizontal pipe (1) from a wall, 
comprising a clip (2) which embraces the pipe (1) and a support shell (4) 

which is to be inserted between the pipe (1) and the underlying portion 
of the pipe clip and which has an approximately semicylindrical support 

surface for the pipe (1) and whose length is a multiple greater than the 
width of the pipe clip (2), characterised in that perforations (6) are 

provided in the approximately semicylindrical support surface. 
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
perforations (6) are in the form of slots which extend in the 

longitudinal direction of the shell and which are arranged in the bottoms 
of radially outwardly pressed elongate depressions (5). 
A device according to claim 2 characterised in that the slots 
(6) or depressions (5) are arranged in a number of longitudinal rows 

which are disposed symmetrically with respect to the perpendicular 
longitudinal central plane of the support shell. 
A device according to claim 3 characterised in that the slots 
(6) or depressions (5) are arranged in two longitudinal rows which are 

disposed at both sides of the vertical longitudinal plane of the support 
shell, which longitudinal rows are displaced relative to each other over 

a circular arc of about 90Â°. 
A device according to claims 2 to 4 characterised in that the 
spacing between depressions (5) which occur in succession in the 

longitudinal direction is greater than the axial width of a pipe clip 
(2).
