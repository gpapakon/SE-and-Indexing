<ABSTRACT>
A holographic center mounted stop light (CHMSL) is disclosed which employs a linear lamp source comprising a long and narrow cylindrical gas discharge bulb (52), a non-imaging light concentrator cavity (56), a plastic light guide (58) and a hologram (62). The CHMSL is characterized by previously unattainable compactness, weight savings, rear occupant headroom, driver rearward visibility and electrical efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to center high mounted 
stoplights (CHMSL) for vehicles. Since 1985 every U.S. automobile has been required to 
include a CHMSL as a safety feature. Typically the CHMSL 
is mounted behind the rear window, either in the roof or on 
top of the rear deck. In either case, the unfortunate 
result is partial obstruction of the driver's view through 
the rear window. U.S. Patent 4,892,369 describes a holographic 
CHMSL which addresses this problem, and includes a 
transparent hologram on or near the rear window and a 
remotely located lamp which delivers light to the hologram. 
Two specific types of holographic CHMSLs are the floodlit 
CHMSL described in U.S. Patent No. 4,916,593, and the 
trapped beam CHMSL described for example in EP-A-0 452 815, 
both assigned to the assignee of this application. 
In the floodlit CHMSL the remotely located lamp 
projects a beam of light through air to a hologram mounted 
on the rear window. In the trapped beam CHMSL, lamp light 
from an incandescent halogen bulb or an elongated thin filament tube 
is injected into a thin 
light guide which carries the light and delivers it to a 
hologram for difracting the playback illumination to produce a 
holographic stoplight image that is visible from behind the vehicle; 
the hologram is secured to the vehicle's rear window. This design 
allows for greater headroom for the 
rear occupant as well as improved rearward visibility for 
the driver.  
 While holographic CHMSLs employing halogen bulbs as 
the light source are advantageous over a conventional CHMSL 
in terms of reduced size and greater driver rearward 
visibility, such CHMSLS require considerable electrical 
power, their size and weight are not as small as that which 
is ultimately desired, they dissipate more heat from the 
bulbs than desired, and the complexity of these devices 
results in additional cost and manufacturing difficulties. It would therefore be advantageous to provide a holographic 
CHMSL which possesses the advantages of the trapped 
beam CHMSL but which overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings. In accordance with the invention, a holographic 
stoplight is provided for a vehicle having a rear window, 
wherein a hologram is mounted on or near the rear window 
for diffracting playback illumination to produce a holographic 
stoplight image visible from behind the vehicle. 
The stoplight includes a light source for providing the 
hologram playback illumination, the source comprising a 
gas-filled lamp tube excited by RF or DC
