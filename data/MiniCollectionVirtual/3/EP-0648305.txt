<ABSTRACT>
A prestressed composite beam structure from which the expansion joints, which were inevitably used in the conventional prestressed composite beam structure can be removed so that the structural and functional problems owing to the expansion joints can be solved and the span of beams can be lengthened, and construction materials can be considerably saved. The construction method in which the composite beams can be made into divided short beams in order to overcome the difficulties of transportation and handling in cases where the length of the prestressed composite beam is long. After the preflexion loads have been applied to the beam which was profiled in reverse to the sag curve of the continuous beam structure, concrete is cast and cured on the flange, and then the preflexion is removed. The problems of the negative moment on the connection between the beams is solved by lifting or lowering the support. For quick and easy assembling with the prestressed slab, the composite beam has shear key grooves and a reinforcing beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for connecting
prestressed continous beams
having lower flanges cast
with compressively prestressed concrete to construct a prestressed
continuous beam having a moment equal to zero at both ends thereof
and negative moments at at least one connection point of said
prestressed beams, the method comprising the steps of:
placing the prestressed beams in end to end relation thereby forming
a row of prestressed beams including a first end prestressed beam
at one end of the row and a second end prestressed beam at an
opposite end of the row; said first and second end prestressed
beams each having an outer end which is not adjacent to an end of
any other prestressed beam in the row, adjacent ends of the
prestressed beams in the row defining said at least one connection
point;connecting the prestressed beams together at said connection point.The known simple beam type prestressed composite beams are
disclosed in Korean Patent Publication No. 88-1163 (July 2, 1988)
and Korean Patent Laid-open No. 92-12687 (July 27, 1992) entitled
"PRESTRESSED COMPOSITE BEAMS AND THE MANUFACTURING METHOD
THEREOF", which provide a simple beam type prestressed composite
beam, in which the cambered I-beam is first prestressed by
preloading, concret is cast on the lower flange of said
prestressed I-beam, and then the preloads are removed after the  
concrete has cured. The conventional prestressed composite beam of
the above type is advantageous in respect of rapid construction,
reduced beam depth, material conservation and improved fatigue
failure strength. But, if the building is of a long construction,
those simple beam type composite beams must be joined to cover the
long distance. In general, those joined portions are treated with
expansion joints.In the case of prestressed composite beam bridges, those
expansion joints are expensive, driving on them feels bad, and
they require maintenance. In addition, vehicles impact on them
and subsequent leakage of water on the expansion joints speeds up
the deterioration of these bridges. The conventional prestressed
composite beam bridges have had to use the expansion joints in
spite of the above problems, because the solution to the
negative moments acting on the inner supports caused by dead and
live loads could not be found. In the case of prestressed
composite beams buildings, these expansion joints weaken
resistance to earthquakes.In the united continuous beam structure, however, contrary to
the conventional prestressed composite beam
