<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a negative charge director (18) for liquid 
electrographic toners. The charge director (18) comprises a very weakly 

associating, charged functional group (13) covalently bonded in the resin coating 
of the toner particle (11), and a very strongly chelating, preferably neutrally 

charged, molecule (15) dispersed in the liquid phase (17) to achieve charge 
separation. The weak association site (14) on the resin is prepared, via well-known 

ion-exchange chemistry, in the metal form desired. Preferred metals are 
those with no regulatory, health or environmental issues, such as K +, Na +, 

Ca²⁺, Al³⁺, Zn²⁺, Zr⁴⁺, Mg²⁺, ammonium (NH₄ +), and organic cations. 
The cation-associated resin is brought into dispersion with the 
solution phase chelating molecule (15). When this is done, the equilibria that 

compete for the cation are such that it is released from the resin and bound in 
the chelate. The toner particle is left with a net negative charge (18) which is 

permanent, but which is balanced by an equal, opposite charge on the chelated 
cationic species (19) in the continuous phase. Preferably, there are no other 

sources of charge in the dispersion, and there is no excess of charge carriers in 
the continuous phase which would interfere with development.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to liquid toner dispersions of the 
type used in electrophotography. More specifically, the invention relates to 
toner particles containing charge directors left with a net negative charge after 
contact with a strongly chelating molecule in the liquid toner dispersions. In electrophotography, a latent image is created on the surface of a 
photoconducting material by selectively exposing areas of the charged surface to 
light. A difference in electrostatic charge density is created between the areas 
on the surface exposed and unexposed to light. The visible image is developed 
by electrostatic toners containing pigment components and thermoplastic 
components. The toners are selectively attracted to the photoconductor surface 
either exposed or unexposed to light, depending on the relative electrostatic 
charges of the photoconductor surface, development electrode and the toner. 
The photoconductor may be either positively or negatively charged, and the 
toner system similarly may contain negatively or positively charged particles. 
For laser printers, the preferred embodiment is that the photoconductor and 
toner have the same polarity, but different levels of charge. A sheet of paper or intermediate transfer medium is then given an 
electrostatic charge opposite that of the toner and passed close to the 
photoconductor surface, pulling the toner from the photoconductor surface onto 
the paper or intermediate medium, still in the pattern of the image developed 
from the photoconductor surface. A set of fuser rollers fixes the toner to the 
paper, subsequent to direct transfer, or indirect transfer when using an intermediate 
transfer medium, producing the printed image. The toner may be in the form of a dust, i.e., powder, or a pigment 
in a resinous carrier, i.e., toner, as described, for examples in Giaimo, U.S. 
Patent No. 2,786,440, issued March 26, 1957. The toner particles may be  
 
used or fixed to the surface by known means such as heat or solvent vapor, or 
they may be transferred to another surface to which they may similarly be fixed, 
to produce a permanent reproduction of the original radiation pattern. Dry development systems suffer from the disadvantage that 
distribution of the powder on the surface of the photoconductor, and the charge 
to mass ratio of the particles, are difficult to control. They can have the further 
disadvantages that excessive amounts of dust may be generated and that high 
resolution is difficult to attain due to the generally
