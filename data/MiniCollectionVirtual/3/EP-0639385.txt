<DESCRIPTION>
A tubing for supplying liquid to and taking out liquid from
artificial organs implanted in a human body (the tubing is
simply called a "tube" hereunder) is extended from the body
occasionally through skin. In the medical treatment as
supplying or taking liquid into or from a subject's body, the
tube is connected at the utmost end with a liquid-containing
bag,a pump or the like. When the treatment finishes, the
utmost end of the tube becomes in the state of being merely
open. The open end of the tube is possibly invaded with
various bacteria, etc., so that the utmost end is to be always
tightly closed by a sanitary stopper means after the medical
treatment finishes.The present invention provides a cheap and sanitary
packaging container for the stopper means.The stoppers are small in size and preserved as spares.
Upon use of the stopper, its package is broken and the stopper
is then used properly and thereafter disposed or burnt. Since
the stoppers themselves are relatively cheap, the packages for 
the stoppers are also to be cheap and functionally to be
severely free of bacteria or sterile and have easiness in use.The stoppers which are used in the above way are each
preserved and packaged conventionally by use of a bag which
is designed to have a tightly sealing-up efficiency and contains
and preserves the stopper.After the medical treatment finishes, an operator opens
the bag and takes out the stopper therefrom, and puts the
stopper on the open utmost end of the tube with his or her hand
holding the stopper, so as to fit the stopper to the utmost
end of the tube.The conventional method has such defect in large possiblity
that the stopper and tube are contaminated with various
bacteria existing on the operator's hand when taking out the
stopper from the bag and fitting the stopper to the tube with
the hand holding the stopper. Hence, a more rational packaging
means for the stopper has been desired.US-A-4444310 discloses a container corresponding to the preamble
of claim 1.The present invention, as characterized in claim 1, provides a
packaging container for the stopper to be used in the foregoing
way, the packaging container being cheap and having a novel
structure as readily usable and sanitary in use.A container according the first invention comprises, as
shown in Fig. 1, a tubular container body which has a flat
chamfered part on the opposite surfaces near the lower end of
the container, the upper edge of the container extending 
outwardly and perpendicularly to the axis of the container,
the end
