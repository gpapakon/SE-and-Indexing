<ABSTRACT>
A chip antenna comprises an antenna conductor
(10), and a dielectric chip (12) which stacks on a

portion of the antenna conductor, in which a conductor
exposed portion of the antenna conductor which is not

overlapped on the dielectric chip is bent along the
surface of the dielectric chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a small-sized
chip antenna for use in terminal apparatuses such as a
mobile phone, mobile information terminal, and radio
local area network (LAN), and a manufacturing method
of the chip antenna.It is an important problem to miniaturize an
antenna of a mobile phone, or the like. Therefore,
various types of small antennas have heretofore been
proposed. As one of the small antennas, a chip antenna
in which an antenna conductor is formed in a
meandered shape and buried in a dielectric material
is known (see Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No.
10-145123).This type of antenna has an advantage that a
length of the antenna can be reduced as compared with
a whip antenna, since the conductor is meandered.
However, the meandered antenna has a large width.Japanese Patent Application TDK Corporation
Publication No. JP2000059125 also discloses a chip antenna
in which an antenna conductor is formed in a meander
shape.An object of the present invention is to provide a
miniaturized chip antenna.A chip antenna according to the present invention
comprises: an antenna conductor that is a meandered
conductor; and a dielectric chip in which a portion of said
antenna conductor is sandwiched therebetween or buried
therein, wherein a conductor exposed portion of said antenna
conductor which is not sandwiched between or buried in the
dielectric chip, is bent along the surface of the dielectric
chip, characterised in that said chip antenna comprises a
plurality of dielectric chips arranged apart from one another
in a meander pitch direction of said meandered conductor, and 
said plurality of dielectric chips are stacked, and in that
the chip antenna further comprises an extension prevention 
member configured to be formed in the meander pitch direction
so that the conductor exposed portion of the meandered
conductor is prevented from being extended in a meander pitch
direction.With this constitution, exposed portions of antenna
conductor between adjacent dielectric chips can be prevented
from being extended.A manufacturing method of a chip antenna according
to the present invention comprises: forming an antenna
conductor pattern including a meandered conductor; forming a
plurality of dielectric chips so as to sandwich or bury at
least a portion of said meandered conductor in a meander
pitch direction of each dielectric chip, and which dielectric
chips are arranged apart from one another in the meander
pitch direction; forming an extension prevention member in a
meander pitch direction between
