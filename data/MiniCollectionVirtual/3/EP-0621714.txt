<ABSTRACT>
A facility is provided in a telecommunications network which transforms a particular 
type of telephone call connection e.g., a connection carrying a call placed to a source 

of information, at the point (105) that it enters the network into a digital network 
connection extending to the back end (400) of a services platform and interfacing 

with the called destination (300-1). Advantageously, then, a voice connection that is 
typically established via the telecommunications network to an information source is 

replaced by an inexpensive digital connection and an information services unit.)

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a telephone call placed to a source of particular 
information. Many businesses use voice interactive systems to automatically respond 
to customer inquiries. For example, a customer may place a call to establish a 
connection via a public switched telephone network to a business. Once the 
connection is established, then the caller may interact with a voice interactive system 
to access desired information relating to, for example, an account that the customer 
has with the business. It is often the case that such a call is placed using a toll free 
telephone number associated with the business, i.e., an 800 service telephone 
number. What this means is that the business pays for the cost of the call, rather 
than the calling customer. The cost of the call is the price that the network charges 
for establishing a connection between the calling customer and business destination, 
and is usually a fixed price. Nevertheless, the accumulated charges for calls placed 
to the business' 800 service number over a period of time could be very high. The invention as set forth in claim 1. In the FIGs: 
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a telecommunications system in which the 
principles of the invention may be practiced; FIG.2 is a block diagram of the universal access node of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the service node of FIG. 1; FIG. 4 is a logical layout of the software programs which respectively 
control the operation of a universal access node and service node and which 
implement the principles of the invention therein; FIG. 5 illustrates in flow chart form the scheduler program of FIG. 4; 
and FIG. 6 illustrates in flow chart form the software processes of FIG. 4. Turning now to FIG. 1, there is shown telecommunications network 
200, which may be, for example, the AT&T public switched network, that provides a 
number of different calling services for its subscribers, e.g., the subscriber associated 
with station S1. Network 200 includes a plurality of interconnected Toll Switching (TS) 
offices, two of which are shown in the FIG., namely TS 105 and TS 110. Such toll 
switches may be any one of a number of different well-known types of switching 
equipments, such as, for example, the No. 4ESS™ (Electronic Switching System) 
commercially available from AT&T. Such toll switches are also interconnected via 
data link 150, which may be, for example, the well-known Common Channel 
Signaling network (CCS). The toll switches exchange data messages with one 
another via CCS network
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system for processing a telephone call in a telecommunications 
network comprising a plurality of network switches, said network switches being 

operative for forwarding a telephone call to its intended destination via a telephone 
connection established between an originating switch and a destination switch, said 

system CHARACTERIZED BY 
   means for receiving a telephone call at said originating switch and 

determining if said call is a first or second type of telephone call, 
   means, responsive to said call being of said first type, for forwarding 

said call to said destination by establishing said telephone connection, and, 
responsive to said call being of said second type, for presenting said call to an 

information services platform comprising at least one access node and at least one 
service node, said service node being connected to a digital network extending to 

said at least one access node and being connected to the destination of said second 
type of call, 

   means for receiving said call at said at least one access node and 
presenting an interface associated with said second type of call to a caller originating 

said second type of call, and 
   means, responsive to receipt of a request entered by said caller as a 

result of said presentation, for forwarding said request to said at least one service 
node via said digital network for presentation to the destination of said second type 

of call. 
The system of claim 1 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said 
interface is presented as though said caller were connected directly to the intended 

destination of said second type of call via a respective destination switch. 
The system of claim 2 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said 
means for presenting includes means for associating a programmable process with 

said second type of telephone call such that said process is programmed to present 
said interface to said caller. 
The system set forth in claim 3 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN 
THAT said means for associating includes means for programming said process at 

the time of receiving said second type of call. 
The system of claim 1 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said 
means for presenting said interface includes means for displaying on a display of a 

data terminal associated with said caller a plurality of menu items defining respective 
types of information supplied by the destination of said second type of call. 
The system of claim 1 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BY 
   means for receiving said request from said digital network and 

presenting said request to the intended destination of said second type of call, in 
which said request is a request for particular information stored in the destination of 

said second type of call, and 
   means for receiving said requested information from the destination of 

said second type of call and returning said requested information via said digital 
network for presentation to said caller. 
The system of claim 5 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BY 
   means for receiving said requested information via said digital network, 

and 
   means for supplying said requested information to said caller in a form 

expected by said caller. 
The system of claim 7 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said 
means of supplying includes means for supplying said information in the form of a 

facsimile. 
The system of claim 7 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said 
means for supplying includes means for supplying said information as data in a form 

appropriate for display on data terminal having a display.
