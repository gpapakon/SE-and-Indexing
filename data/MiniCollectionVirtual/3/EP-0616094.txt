<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coffer for a ceiling, the coffer exhibiting a planar basic body (1) on whose longitudinal sides and transverse sides there are formed angled-off border strips (2, 3) which are provided with means for suspending the coffer on a load-bearing structure. In order, with simple construction of the coffer, to permit simple and cost-effective adaptation to a wide range of load-bearing systems, the invention provides that the corner regions (4) of the border strips (2, 3) are each of identical design, and that a corner part (5) serving for the suspension of the coffer can be inserted into the respective corner of the coffer.
