<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an enamelled tubular installation part which can be inserted into a container connection stud, can be fastened thereon, is enamelled at all locations in contact with the product and can be used as a submersion tube. The installation part is of a double-walled design, provision being made for two coaxial tubes (1,2) which are connected to one another at the lower end via a connecting region. The outer surface of the outer tube (1), the inner surface of the inner tube (2) and the connecting region are enamelled. The diameter of the outer tube may be selected in accordance with the point of view of strength such that the outer tube permits the performance of a further function of the installation part. Arranged in the inner tube (2) is a sample tube (3) consisting of a material whose corrosion strength corresponds to that of enamel. The outer tube may, for example, be a constituent part of a thermometer tube or of a baffle. The outer tube may also serve as a measuring-probe carrier.

An enamelled tubular insert element which can be inserted 
into a pipe connector of a vessel and be secured therein and 

which is enamelled at all points that are in contact with the 
product, and that can be used as a dip tube and for taking 

samples, characterized in that the insert element is of a 
double-walled design in that two coaxial pipes (1, 2) are provided 

that are connected to each other at the bottom end via a 
connecting zone, that the outer surface of the outer pipe (1), 

the inner surface of the inner pipe (2) and the connecting zone 
are enamelled, and that the diameter of the outer pipe (1) is 

chosen according to strength criteria in such a way that it allows 
the insert element to perform a further function. 
An enamelled insert element according to claim 1, characterized 
in that in the inner pipe (2) there is arranged a 

sample-taking tube (3) made of a material whose corrosion 
resistance corresponds to that of enamel, and whose outer 

diameter is smaller than the inner diameter of the inner pipe 
(2). 
An enamelled insert element according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the material of the sample-taking tube (3) is 

PTFE. 
An enamelled insert element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the outer pipe (1) 

forms part of an agitator baffle. 
An enamelled insert element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the outer pipe (1) 

forms part of a thermometer tube, and that in the gap (8) between 
the outer and inner pipe (1, 2) there are arranged 

temperature measuring means.  
 
An enamelled insert element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that on the surface of the 

enamelling of the outer pipe (1), provision is made for a 
measuring electrode zone (9) made of enamel. 
An enamelled insert element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the inner pipe (2) 

projects over the surface of a fastening flange (4) provided at 
the upper end of the insert element.
