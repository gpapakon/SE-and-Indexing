<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical recording
medium reproducing apparatus, and in particular, to an
optical recording medium reproducing apparatus adapted to
reproduce optically recorded information recorded on an
optical recording medium by irradiating the medium with a
light spot of a laser beam.Compact discs (CDs) have conventionally been used as
optical recording medium reproducing apparatus of this kind,
wherein the disc as an optical recording medium is
irradiated via an optical system 0.45 in numerical aperture
(NA) with a laser beam 780 [nm] in wave length which is
generated by a laser diode.In recent years, however, new laser beam sources with a
wave length smaller than 780 [nm] (for example, red = 680
[nm], and semiconductor lasers of green and blue) have been
developed as light sources for optical recording medium
reproducing apparatuses. These new laser beam sources
serve to implement recording medium reproducing apparatuses
that can reproduce recording media with a higher recording
density than compact discs. These recording medium
reproducing apparatuses that can reproduce recording media
with a higher recording density than compact discs
desirably have a compatible reproducing function that also
enables conventional compact discs (CDs) to be reproduced.The diameter of the light spot that can be formed by a
laser beam of a large wave length is selected so as to be
somewhat larger than the width W1 of pits P1 formed in the
compact disc as recorded information as shown by reference 
L1 in Fig. 1(A). This allows the light spot L1 to
constantly lie across the width W1 during movement when
entering the pit P1 from land to scan it.A sum signal (hereafter referred to as an "RF signal")
can thus be obtained from an optical pickup based on light
reflected from the compact disc because of the light spot
L1 in Fig. 1(A). The RF signal falls from a first signal
level LV11 to a second signal level LV12 when the light
spot L1 passes through the end of the pit P1, and
subsequently maintains the signal level LV12 until the
light spot L1 has passed the pit P1 with itself lying
across the pit P1, as shown in Fig. 1(B). This results in
a sum signal in which the signal level changes in response
to the lengths of the land and the pit P1 because the light
spot L1 scans both the land and the pit P1.Thus, the signal level of the RF signal RF1 decreases
during scanning due to the interference between light
reflected from the pit P1 and light reflected from a
reflecting surface (the land) located around
