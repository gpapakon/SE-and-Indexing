<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a combination of at least two monolconal antibodies which are capable of preventing and treating human malignancies wherein the malignant cells overexpress gp185erbB-2. The monoclonal antibodies of the combination recognize different epitopes of the gp185 expression product of erbB-2, therefore, the antibodies do not cross react with each other. Preferably, the combination decreases the expression product of the erbB-2 gene. In another embodiment, the combination does not essentially increase tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp185 expression product.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A COMBINATION OF ANTI-erbB-2 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND METHOD OF USINGThe present invention relates to a combination o monoclonal antibodies capable of preventing and treatin tumors. More specifically, the monoclonal antibodies ar single chain monoclonal antibodies which are capable o treating and preventing tumors.Amplification and/or overexpression of the erbB-2 gen (also called HER-2 or neu) results in overexpression o erbB-2 RNA and proteins and has been demonstrated in 20-30 of adenocarcinomas of the breast (1-5), ovary (3), lung (6 and stomach (7). Two lines of evidence implicate erbB- overexpression in the pathogenesis of human neoplasia First, overexpression has been linked with poor prognosis i breast (8-11), ovarian (12), stomach (13), and lung cance (14), indicating that overexpression alters the cancer cell Second, artificial overexpression of erbB-2 induces transformed phenotype in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (15, 16) a well as in mammary epithelial cells (17) suggesting tha overexpression can contribute directly to the development o the malignant phenotype. Due to the extensive homology between gpl85erbB-2 an the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), it is widel assumed that their activation might proceed through simila mechanisms. One such mechanism involves recepto dimerization/oligomerization which is thought to be a important step in the activation of the EGFR intrinsi tyrosine kinase function (18, 19). Interfering wit receptor-receptor interactions has been evaluated as potential therapeutic approach to treatment of cance rs wit erbB-2 overexpression. Previous studies have evaluated th use of single monoclonal antibodies directed against erbB- 

WO94/00136 PCI7US92/08545(20) and the related Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGF protein (21) as potential therapeutic agents for t treatment of cancer.Use of single monoclonal antibodies directed again erbB-2 which have been evaluated as potential therapeut agents have resulted in increased gpl85e *bB autophosphorylation, resulting from increases in t activity of tyrosine kinase. Single antibody agents ha shown promise as potential anticancer therapies (20, 27).SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONOne object of Applicant's invention relates to combination of at least two monoclonal antibodies capable treating or preventing human malignancies wherein t malignant cells overexpress gpl85 ~ . The combinati comprises at least a first and second antibody each of whi recognizes the gpl85 extracellular domain of erbB-2. T activity demonstrated by the combination
