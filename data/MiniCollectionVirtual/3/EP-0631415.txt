<ABSTRACT>
A system and method using canonical telephone numbers which allows 
automatic calling with any location in the world independent of the caller's location. 

The caller canonical telephone number and a plurality of caller prefixes are stored 
within the system. A telephone directory stores a plurality of callee canonical 

telephone numbers for locations throughout the world. The caller selects a callee 
canonical telephone number from the telephone directory, and the system uses the 

callee canonical telephone number and the caller canonical telephone number to 
determine which digits of the callee canonical telephone number must be placed on 

the telephone line to complete the call. The system then adds the appropriate prefix 
for international, long distance, or local telephone calls. The telephone directory may 

be in the form of a software file that can be transferred to any telephone location 
throughout the world. The telephone directory may be directly installed at any caller 

location without alteration for the specific location. The user may use a keypad to 
enter new callee canonical telephone numbers into the telephone directory, or may 

manually enter a non-canonical callee telephone number.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a system and method for 
telephonic communications, and more specifically to a system and method for 
uniquely defining and dialing canonical telephone numbers. Telephonic communications has become an accepted part of 
modem society. Even in the most remote portions of the earth, telephone service 
is available through a worldwide telephone communications network. Other 
communication devices, such as facsimile machines, can also use the worldwide 
telephone communications network to send a facsimile message from one remote 
corner of the earth to another, or from one office to another in the same building, 
simply by dialing the appropriate facsimile telephone number. The worldwide 
telephone communications network couples these devices to each other. Obviously, to properly complete a telephone connection a caller 
must know the complete telephone number of the location to which the telephone 
call is placed. A drawback of the current worldwide telephone communications 
network is that the caller must also be aware of the location from which the call 
is being placed (i.e., the caller telephone number). Thus, the number and 
sequence of digits of the callee telephone number is dependent on the location of 
both the caller and the callee. For example, in some locations the caller may have to dial a local 
prefix, such as a "9," to connect to an outside line while other locations do not 
require that a 9 be dialed to connect to an outside line. The caller may be 
required to dial an area code to properly complete a telephone call to one 
location within the United States but not to another more proximate location. 
These location-dependent requirements often cause confusion in placing 
telephone calls and the dialing of telephone numbers incorrectly. Therefore, it can be appreciated that there is a significant need for a 
system and method for uniquely identifying the callee telephone and placing 
telephone calls in a manner that automatically takes caller location into account.  The invention is embodied in a system coupled to a telephone 
exchange and containing a station information storage area storing a station 
canonical telephone number for the caller location. Means for entering a callee 
canonical telephone number are also provided. The system uses matching means 
for sequentially comparing first and second portions of the station canonical 
telephone number with corresponding first and second portions of the callee 
canonical telephone number. The matching
