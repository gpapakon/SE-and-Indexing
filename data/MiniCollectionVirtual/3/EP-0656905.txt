<ABSTRACT>
A polypeptide isolated from the venom of the (Agelenopsis aperta) spider blocks calcium channels in cells of various organisms and is useful in blocking said calcium channels in cells, per se, in the treatment of calcium channel-mediated diseases and conditions and in the control of invertebrate pests.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polypeptide found in the venom of the Agelenopsis 
aperta spider and to a polypeptide having substantially the same amino acid 
sequence and substantially the same activity as said polypeptide. The polypeptides 
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof block calcium channels in cells 
including neuronal and muscle cells of various organisms including invertebrates 
and vertebrates. This invention also relates to the use of said polypeptides and their 
salts in blocking calcium channels in cells such as cells in the nervous and muscular 
system of an organism, per se, and in the treatment of calcium channel mediated 
diseases and conditions in a mammal. Further, this invention relates to 
compositions comprising said polypeptides and salts thereof. Compounds which are calcium antagonists have a variety of utilities. 
Calcium antagonists can find clinical application in the treatment of such conditions 
as angina, hypertension, cardiomyopathies, supraventricular arrhythmias, 
aesophogeal achalasia, premature labor and Raynaud's disease among others. See 
W. G. Nayler, Calcium Antagonists, Academic Press, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich 
Publishers, New York, NY 1988, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. Further, such compounds are useful in the study of the physiology of 
cells such as neuronal and muscle cells. Other polypeptides isolated from Agelenopsis aperta are disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,122,596.  
 This invention concerns a polypeptide found in the venom of the Agelenopsis 
aperta spider. The polypeptide of this invention and the fraction in which it is 
present according to this invention are as follows. Agelenopsis peptide J2 has the following amino acid sequence, SEQ ID NO: 
1. 
The polypeptide of this invention blocks calcium channels in cells. 
Accordingly, this polypeptide is useful in blocking calcium channels in cells, per se. 
This polypeptide is also useful in the control of invertebrate pests and in the 
treatment of diseases and conditions in a mammal mediated by calcium channel 
function in cells. Also within the scope of this invention are polypeptides which have 
substantially the same amino acid sequence as described above but wherein certain 
of the amino acids are substituted by other amino acids without affecting the calcium 
channel blocking activity of the polypeptide. This invention also concerns pharmaceutical compositions comprising said 
polypeptides and methods of administering said polypeptides. Venom is
