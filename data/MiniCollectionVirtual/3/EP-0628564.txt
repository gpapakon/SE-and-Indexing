compound to form Z-MR₂-Z', where Z is a substituted or unsubstituted 

fluorenyl radical, M is Ge, Si, or Sn, X is Cl, Br, F, or I, each R is a 
hydrocarbyl radical containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and Z' is an 

unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl, substituted cyclopentadienyl, 
unsubstituted indenyl, substituted indenyl, unsubstituted fluorenyl, or 

a substituted fluorenyl. Also new fluorene compounds are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluorene compounds. In 
another aspect, this invention relates to methods for making fluorene 
compounds. The term "fluorene" as used herein refers to the tricyclic 
compounds which are generally illustrated by the following structural 
formula: 
In the chemical names used herein, the position of substituents on the 
fluorene will be indicated by referring to the point of attachment on 
the ring carbon by the number system illustrated in the above formula.  
 
Unless otherwise indicated, the term fluorenyl as used herein refers to 
the 9-fluorenyl radical. Fluorene compounds have found a number of uses in the past. 
Some such compounds have been found particularly useful for preparing 
metallocene compounds which have utility as catalysts for the 
polymerization of olefins. It would therefore be desirable to provide a relatively simple 
process employing one common starting material, where such process is 
suitable for producing a variety of fluorene compounds. It would also 
be desirable to provide a process to prepare such compounds where the 
compounds are separated in substantially pure form. An object of the present invention is to provide a new method 
for preparing certain fluorene compounds. Another object is to provide methods which can produce 
fluorene compounds that are more readily obtained in substantially pure 
form. Another object is to provide certain new fluorene compounds. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a 
process comprising (1) reacting an alkali metal salt of Z with MX₄ to 
produce a trihalo compound, (2) reacting the trihalo compound with an 
alkali metal salt of Z' to produce a dihalo compound, and (3) reacting 
the dihalo compound with at least one alkali metal organic compound to 
produce Z-MR₂-Z', wherein Z is an unsubstituted fluorenyl or substituted 
fluorenyl, Z' is an unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl, a substituted 
cyclopentadienyl, an unsubstituted indenyl, a substituted indenyl, an 
unsubstituted tetrahydroindenyl, a substituted tetrahydroindenyl, an  
 
unsubstituted fluorenyl, or a substituted fluorenyl; M is germanium, 
silicon, or tin; X is a hologen; and each R is an individually selected 
hydrocarbyl radical containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention 
there are provided new fluorene compounds. The Z radical is an unsubstituted fluorenyl or substituted 
fluorenyl. The currently preferred Z radical is an unsubstituted 
fluorenyl radical. Z' is an organic
