<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the stacking of cuboid bales, with a trailer device (2) on a baling press (3), with a receiving surface (10) for the bales (5) leaving the baling press, with a stacking device for stacking two bales one on top of the other and with an ejector device, the stacking device having a supporting frame (6) and a gripper device, arranged above the receiving surface, for gripping and lifting a first bale, the gripper device being articulated on the supporting frame in such a way that it lifts the first bale, during the forward movement of the latter, as a result of a second bale pushing from behind, up to the height of the second bale. The method comprises the steps of gripping a first bale leaving the baling press by means of a gripper device mounted on a supporting frame, of lifting the first bale as a result of the advance of the following second bale up to a height which corresponds to the height of the second bale, the first bale moving from the gripping point to the point, at which lifting is terminated, on a circular path determined by the fastening of the gripper device on the supporting frame, of pushing the second bale forwards under the first bale, and of releasing the first bale when the second bale is located essentially under the first bale. The invention makes it possible to have an inexpensive apparatus for the stacking of, in particular, large bales having dimensions of a width of 1.20 m and a height of 0.70 m, without complicated control means having to be used.
