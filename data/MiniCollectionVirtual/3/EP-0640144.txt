<ABSTRACT>
Methods are provided for determining proteinases and proteinase inhibitors based on the ability of phenanthradine coumpounds to intercalate between the bases of DNA with a resulting increase in their fluorescence. The DNA is complexed with a protein to block binding of the phenanthradine. Proteinase activity degrades the complexed protein, exposing DNA to phenanthradine binding accompanied by increased fluorescence.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHODS FOR ASSAYING PROTEINASES AND PROTEINASE INHIBITORSThis invention relates to methods for measuring proteinase enzymes and to methods for measuring proteinase inhibitors.Proteinases and their inhibitors have become the subject of explosive research interest recently, since they control very important processes; involvement of proteinases and their inhibitors has been shown in the regulation of many fundamental biological processes, including regulation of virus infectivity, λ phage development, pathogenicity of bacteria, healing in plants and tumour invasiveness. Their importance in human diseases is well established, as proteinases or their inhibitors have been implicated in hypertension, Alzheimer disease and lung disease. Proteinases and/or their inhibitors also play a role in blood clotting (antithrombin III deficiency) , hereditary angioedema (CjQ inhibitor deficiency) , acute lymphocytic leukemia(neutral endopeptidase which cleaves endorphins shows elevated levels) and in metastatic tumours. Proteinases are also implicated in parasitic diseases such as malaria and in AIDS. o^-antiproteinase (or α,-antitrypsin) is one of the major an iproteinase inhibitors in human serum. It inhibits all serine proteinases, to which it binds with very high affinity, and its major function is probably the inhibition of neutrophil elastase in the lung and in the liver, to prevent destruction of the matrix proteins of connective tissue. Genetic deficiency of αj -antiproteinase is a proven cause of early onset emphysema and possibly liver diseases. Inactivation of ctj-antiproteinase by cigarette smoking has been proposed as a causal factor of emphysema in smokers. 

 There is therefore a need for convenient, reliable and sensitive methods for measuring proteinases and their inhibitors in many clinical situations.The assays for proteinases available to date can be divided into three groups. (i) Activity can be measured by hydrolysis of synthetic substrates that release chromogenic compounds e.g. nitroanilides, or fluorogenic molecules e.g. 6-aminoguinolone (Tuppy et al. (1962) Hoppe-Seylers 2. Physiol. Che ., vol. 329, pp. 278 - 288) . These assays are rapid and can be very specific. Sensitivity is usually around 1 μg of proteinase. (ii) Insoluble proteins, as substrates, give rise to hydrolysis products in soluble forms. Substrates are azo-proteins and radiolabelled insoluble proteins, e.g. collagen or elastin (Phillips et al. (1989) J. Clin. path. Vol. 37, pp. 329 - 331; Truden et al. (1985) A er. J. Path., vol.
