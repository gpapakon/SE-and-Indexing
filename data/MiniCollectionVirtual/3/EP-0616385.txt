<ABSTRACT>
A diverging shell antenna fed by waveguide supplying TE₁₁ 
mode is described. A dielectric rod (46) partially contained within the 

waveguide (36) converts the TE₁₁ mode to a dominant or 
HE₁₁ mode. The HE₁₁ mode is controllably converted 

to second and third order modes in the diverging shell (30) by 
discontinuities (54) placed in predetermined locations in the diverging 

shell. The discontinuities (50,52) generating the second mode are 
incorporated into the dielectric rod structure (46). Turning of the 

relative amplitude and phase of the second and third order modes 
relative to the HE₁₁ mode is achieved by slideably positioning 

the dielectric rod (46). An alternative embodiment of the inventive 
device includes a reactive surface of the diverging shell.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to waveguide fed diverging shell 
antennas, and more particularly, to antennas employing positionable dielectric 
rods containing discontinuities to generate higher order modes and control 
phase relationships between the modes. Diverging shell antennas often employ waveguides to supply 
input signals. In such configurations, a dominant mode, such as a TE₁₁ mode 
in a circular waveguide, is used as the input signal. Such modes are generated 
in the waveguide from an external source in a manner known in the art. In the absence of any other elements the TE₁₁ mode propagates 
from the waveguide through the diverging shell to the distal end of the 
diverging shell. The signal then exits through the antenna aperture and travels 
to the far field. Desired antenna performance characteristics such as gain, 
sidelobe levels, bandwidth, and E-plane and H-plane field strength 
distributions are often not achievable using this configuration. It is known 
that the performance or characteristics of an antenna can be adjusted by 
controlling a combination of modes at the distal end of the diverging shell. 
For example a high gain relatively narrow beam antenna pattern can be 
achieved by combining HE₁₁ with TE₁₂ and TM₁₂ modes. It is therefore desirable to convert the dominant TE₁₁ mode 
supplied to the waveguide to a controlled combination of HE₁₁ and higher 
modes at the output aperture. There are a number of methods of converting the dominant 
TE₁₁ mode supplied in the waveguide to a controlled set of modes in an 
output aperture. Where the dominant mode is a TE₁₁ mode in a circular 
waveguide, conversion of the TE₁₁ mode into an HE₁₁ mode within the 
waveguide is often employed as a first step. This conversion can be achieved by a number of techniques 
such as using one of many forms of "reactive" surface for the outer wall of the  
 
circular waveguide. Typical "reactive surfaces used for this purpose are metal 
corrugations, dielectric coated wire adjacent to an outer conducting surface, or 
a thin dielectric sleeve with an outer conducting surface. Another technique is 
the use of a dielectric rod positioned to be axially symmetrical with the 
waveguide. Where the cross-sectional geometry is chosen appropriately and 
a sufficient length is chosen, a conversion of the dominant TE₁₁ mode to the 
dominant HE₁₁ mode will occur, as is known in the art. In this manner, the 
dominant HE₁₁ hybrid mode is produced within the circular waveguide and 
feeds the diverging shell. Where waveguide-fed
