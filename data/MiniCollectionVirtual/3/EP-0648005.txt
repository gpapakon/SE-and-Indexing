<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for reducing the peak load of power supply networks to which a plurality of load units each having a plurality of loads are connected, it being possible to limit the power consumption of the load units to a predetermined limiting value, at least some of the loads of a load unit can be operated only successively in time in accordance with a coordination program which can be preselected, if the power consumption of the switched-on loads has reached the predetermined limiting value. An apparatus for limiting the power consumption of a load unit which is fed from a power supply connection and has a plurality of loads 2a - 2e comprises a coordination device 14 which is connected to isolating switches 12b - 12e which are assigned to at least some of the loads, and controls these isolating switches 12b - 12e in accordance with a program, in such a manner that the power consumption from the power supply connection 4 does not exceed a predetermined limiting value. If the power consumption exceeds or falls below the predetermined limiting value, the coordination device 14 opens or closes, respectively, isolating switches in a sequence which is defined by a coordination programme which is stored in it and can be preselected.

Apparatus for limiting the power consumption of a household 
which is supplied from a power supply connection (4; 54, 64) and which 

includes a plurality of consumers (2-2e), comprising 

a device (6) for detecting the power consumption of the household; 
circuit breaker switches (12b-12e) associated with at least some of 
the consumers; and 
a co-ordination means (14) which is connected to the circuit 
breaker switches (12b-12e) and controls them in accordance with a 

program in such a way that the power consumption of the household from 
the power supply connection does not exceed a predetermined limit value, 
wherein the co-ordination means (14) opens the circuit breaker 
switches in a sequence which is determined by a preselectable co-ordination 

program stored in it when the predetermined power consumption 
limit value is exceeded and closes them when the power consumption falls 

below the predetermined limit value, and 
wherein after a drop in the power consumption below the limit value 
the co-ordination means (14) closes a further circuit breaker switch if 

the closing of a first circuit breaker switch results in the limit value 
being exceeded and thus renewed opening of that circuit breaker switch. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the co-ordination 
means (14) includes a clock (22) which adjusts the limit 

value and/or various prioritisation programs for the established 
sequence. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in 
that there is provided the device (18) for recognising closure of 

manually actuable operating switches (10b-10e) of the individual 
consumers, which operating switches are in series with the circuit 

breaker switches (12b-12e), and the sequence of closing of the operating 
switches determines the sequence of closing of the associated circuit 

breaker switches.  
 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that 


there is provided a fuse unit with fuses (8a-8e; 58a, 58b, 68a, 
68b) by way of which the individual consumers are connected to the mains 

connection, and 
the individual circuit breaker switches (12b-12e) are connected in 
series with the individual fuses. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that the circuit breaker switches (12b-12e) with further associated 

components are combined together in a common housing of a unit which can 
be subsequently fitted. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 and 5 characterised in that a 
manually actuable input unit (24) of a programmable electronic control 

unit is arranged remote from the housing containing the circuit breaker 
switches (12b-12e). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 6 characterised in 
that the consumer unit is connected to a plurality of phases (54,64) of 

the power supply and that there are provided change-over switches (70, 
71, 72, 73) which are controlled by the co-ordination means and with 

which the individual consumers can be selectively connected to different 
phases.
