<ABSTRACT>
A wax-free chewing gum is provided which has improved processing and chewing properties, similar to a wax-containing chewing gum, and which does not exhibit short texture. The improvement is effected by adding an incremental amount of an extender to the chewing gum. A method is also provided for making a wax-free chewing gum which has processing and chewing properties similar to a wax-containing chewing gum.

<DESCRIPTION>
International Application No. PCT/US92/11317, filed on
December 30, 1992, PCT/US92/09615, filed on November 6, 1992,
and PCT/US92/01686, filed on March 3, 1992 are
incorporated herein by reference.The present invention relates to a method making a
wax-free chewing gum having improved processability and
chewing texture, and to improved wax-free chewing gums
prepared by this method.In US-A-5023093, there is disclosed a chewing gum
base with reduced calorie content. The central
components of that gum base are 10-25% polyvinyl acetate
having a medium molecular weight of about 35,000 to
55,000, 4.5% to about 10% acetylated monoglyceride.In US-A-4387108, there is described a non-adhesive
chewing gum composition which does not adhere to
dentures, fillings or natural teeth consisting
essentially of an elastomer, at least one emulsifier
including lecithin, lecithin derivatives, or mixture
thereof 0.5 to 0.6%, an elastomer solvent, including the
glyceryl ester of partially hydrogenated wood rosin 2.5
to 8%, as well as one or more mineral adjuvants, a nontoxic
vinyl polymer and at least one oleaginous
plasticizer, including waxes.U.S Patent 3,984,574, issued to Comollo, discloses
an abhesive chewing gum base in which the non-tack
properties were achieved by eliminating conventional
chewing gum base ingredients which were found to
contribute to chewing gum tackiness, and by substituting
non-tacky ingredients in place of the conventional
ingredients. Specifically, it was discovered that three
classes of materials account for conventional chewing
gum tackiness. These materials are elastomers, resins,
and waxes. Comollo eliminated natural and some synthetic
elastomers from chewing gum base, and substituted in
their place one or more non-tacky synthetic elastomers
such as polyisobutylene, polyisoprene, isobutylene-isoprene
copolymer and butadiene-styrene copolymer.
Comollo also eliminated the tack-producing natural
resins and modified natural resins and used instead
relatively high amounts of hydrogenated or partially
hydrogenated vegetable oils or animal fats. Finally,
Comollo completely excluded waxes from the gum base,
but included polyvinyl acetate, fatty acids, and mono
and diglycerides of fatty acids.The patent to Comollo relates only to non-tack
chewing gums and gum bases, and not to wax-free
chewing gums in general. Ordinarily, the wax used in
chewing gums (including gum bases) acts as a
plasticizing softener (also called an extender) for the
elastomer in the chewing gum base. A plasticizing
softener is a

A method of making a wax-free chewing gum
comprising the steps of:


selecting a wax containing chewing gum
formulation;
excluding the wax from the wax-containing chewing
gum formulation to provide an interim formulation

which is wax-free;
selecting an extender from the group consisting
of triacetin, tributyrin, distilled monoglycerides

containing at least 90 wt% monoglycerides and lesser
quantities of diglycerides and triglycerides, low and

medium chain triglycerides containing 6 to 14 carbon
atoms, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol

monostearate, sucrose fatty acid esters, lecithin and
combinations thereof;
modifying the wax-free interim formulation to
include from 0.02 to 2.0 % by weight of the chewing gum of extender in

addition to any extender present in the wax-containing
gum formulation which amount of extender is sufficient

to produce a wax-free chewing gum formulation having
processing and chewing properties similar to the wax-containing

chewing gum; and
preparing a wax-free chewing gum according to the
modified formulation which due to the higher amount of

extender extrudes, sheets, scores and cuts like the
wax-containing gum of the original formulation.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
extender comprises triacetin.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
extender comprises tributyrin. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
extender comprises a material selected from the group

consisting of distilled monoglycerides, low and medium
chain triglycerides, acetylated monoglycerides, and

combinations thereof.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
extender comprises a material selected from the group

consisting of Glycerol monostearate, sucrose fatty
acid esters, lecithin, and combinations thereof.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5

wherein the extender is added in an amount of from 0.1
to 1.0 % by weight of the chewing gum.
A method as claimed in any previous claim,

wherein the extender is added during manufacture of
the wax-free chewing gum.
A method as claimed in any previous claim,

wherein the extender is added during manufacture of a
chewing gum base which is used in the wax-free chewing

gum.
A method as claimed in any previous claim,

wherein the extender comprises a combination of
triacetin and tributyrin.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim

wherein there is provided a wax-free chewing gum base
having a composition similar to a wax-containing 

chewing gum base except for the absence of wax and
including the wax-free chewing gum base in the chewing

gum.
A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
extender is added during manufacture of the wax-free

chewing gum base.
A wax-free chewing gum having improved processing
and chewing properties, comprising:


an amount of from 0.02 to 2.0 % by weight of the
chewing gum of extender selected from the group

comprising tributyrin, and combinations of
triacetin and tributyrin.
A wax-free chewing gum as claimed in claim 12

wherein the incremental extender comprises a combination of triacetin and tributyrin.
A wax-free chewing gum as claimed in claim 12,

wherein the incremental extender comprises tributyrin.
Use of triacetin, tributyrin or a mixture thereof
as a substitute for wax in chewing gum to produce a

wax-free gum.
A method of making wax-free chewing gum wherein
the gum is prepared according to the modified

formulation described in any one of claims 1 to 11.
