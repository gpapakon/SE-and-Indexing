<ABSTRACT>
The aim of the invention is to provide a means for determining the inertial position of a vehicle whilst excluding interference caused by dynamic vehicle movements as completely as possible. To this end, the accelerations (az, ay, ax) of the vehicle in the direction of its vertical axis (z) and in the direction of its lateral axis (y) and/or its longitudinal axis (x) are measured and the position angle ( phi x) of the vehicle (FZ) in relation to its longitudinal axis (x) and/or the position angle ( phi y) in relation to its lateral axis (y) is determined from the acceleration (ay, ax) in the direction of the lateral axis (y) or the longitudinal axis (x) and the acceleration (az) in the direction of the vertical axis (z), according to the relations (1):  phi x1 = arcsin (ay/g),  phi y1 = arcsin (ax/g) and (2):  phi x2 = arccos (az/g),  phi y2 = arccos (az/g). The smaller of the two angles  phi x1 and  phi x2 or  phi y1 and  phi y2 is taken as the inertial position angle.
