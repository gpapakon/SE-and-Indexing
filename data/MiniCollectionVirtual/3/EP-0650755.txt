<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a filter assembly is 
described wherein a filter pack is seated in an end 

cap and contacted with a mixture comprising a binder 
and a particulate material including a low 

temperature component and a high temperature 
component. The filter pack, the end cap, and the 

particulate material are heat treated to form a 
strong, effective bond.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter assembly and
a method of making a filter assembly, and, in
particular, a method for bonding an end cap to a
filter pack.An important aspect of the manufacture of
filter assemblies is the process of bonding an end
cap to a filter pack. As used herein, the term
"filter pack" refers to any structure that includes
a filter medium. The filter medium may be, but is
not limited to, a metal mesh or a porous metal
medium formed from metal powder or metal fibers.One conventional method of bonding is known as
brazing. The end of a filter pack is placed in an
end cap with a brazing alloy and the resultant
assembly heated until the brazing alloy melts. The
assembly is then cooled and as the molten brazing
alloy solidifies, it bonds the end cap to the filter
pack.One disadvantage of this brazing method is that
the molten brazing alloy may wick up into or along
the filter pack for a significant distance away from
the end cap. This sometimes starves the joint
between the filter pack and the end cap for brazing
alloy, resulting in incomplete bonding. In
addition, when the molten brazing alloy solidifies,
it then blinds the porous filter medium, i.e.,
closes off the pores of the filter medium to fluid
flow. This significantly decreases the effective
filtration area of the filter medium and reduces the
efficiency of the filter assembly.In another conventional method of bonding, the 
end of a filter pack is compressed to form a dense
area. A stainless steel ring and the compressed end
of the filter are then positioned in an end cap.
The entire assembly is then welded together.This method gives rise to several
disadvantages. By compressing the ends of the
filter pack, the effective filtration area is
reduced, thereby reducing the efficiency of the
filter assembly. Compressing the ends of the filter
pack may also damage the filter medium, creating
leaks which are difficult to repair. This is a
problem especially associated with pleated filter
assemblies having wide, open pleats. Special
tooling is required, which renders this method
undesirably expensive. Further, welding the filter
pack to the end cap frequently results in
discoloration of the filter assembly.Accordingly, a method of making a filter
assembly is disclosed comprising the steps of
seating a filter pack in an end cap and contacting
the filter pack and the end cap with a mixture
including a binder and a particulate material, thus
forming a filter assemblage. The particulate
material includes at least two components. One of
