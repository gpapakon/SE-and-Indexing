<ABSTRACT>
Independent suspension for a motor vehicle rear axle assembly, in which each wheel is mounted so that it can rotate on a stub axle (4) borne by the free end of a suspension arm (2) connected to a structural element (1) of the vehicle by a torsion means (6) and at least one elastic element (11), characterised in that a mechanism (7) contained inside the suspension arm (2) connects the torsion means (6) to the wheel stub axle (4) and transmits the vertical and longitudinal loadings exerted on the stub axle (4) respectively to the torsion means (6) and to the elastic means (11).
