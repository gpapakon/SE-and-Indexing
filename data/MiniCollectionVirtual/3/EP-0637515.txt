<ABSTRACT>
A co-winding type thermal transfer sheet is 
constituted by forming on one surface side of a substrate 

film (1) a heat-fusible ink layer (2) and causing a fabric 
(B) to be peelably bonded on to the heat-fusible ink layer 

by the medium of an adhesive layer (C). The thus 
constituted co-winding type thermal transfer sheet is 

capable of being used in a large size printer such as a 
large size plotter in order to print characters and images 

on the fabric which are similar to those formed on fabric 
by the use of India ink and a brush.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal transfer 
sheet, particularly to a thermal transfer sheet of the co-winding 
type wherein a thermal transfer sheet and a 
transfer receiving material have been temporarily bonded to 
each other. Hitherto, in a case where output from a computer or a 
word processor is printed by use of a thermal transfer 
system, there has been used a thermal transfer sheet 
comprising a substrate film and a heat-fusible ink layer 
disposed on one surface side thereof. Such a conventional thermal transfer sheet comprises a 
substrate film comprising a paper having a thickness of 10 
to 20 µm such as a capacitor paper and a paraffin paper, or 
comprising a plastic film having a thickness of 3 to 
20 µm such as a polyester film and a cellophane film. The 
above-mentioned thermal transfer sheet has been prepared by 
coating the substrate film with a heat-fusible ink 
comprising a wax and a colorant such as a dye or a pigment 
mixed therein, to form a heat-fusible ink layer on the 
substrate film. When printing is effected on a transfer receiving 
material by using such a conventional thermal transfer 
sheet, the thermal transfer sheet is supplied from a roll 
thereof, while a continuous or sheet-like transfer-receiving 
material is also supplied, so that the former and 
the latter are superposed on each other on a platen. Then, 
in such a state, heat is supplied to the thermal transfer 
sheet from the back side surface thereof by means of a 
thermal head to melt the ink layer and transfer it to the 
transfer receiving material, whereby a desired image is 
formed.  
 Various curtains, outdoor displays, flags, etc., 
wherein large characters have been written on a cloth or 
fabric, etc., by use of India ink and a brush, are widely 
used for the purpose of advertising, publication or 
propaganda, or various events or functions such as 
ceremonial occasions (e.g. coming-of-age ceremonies, 
weddings, funerals, festivals, etc.). In a case where 
characters are written on the cloth or fabric by the use of 
India ink and a brush in the manner as described above, 
when the same characters are written on a large number of 
cloths or fabrics, a printing process may be used. 
However, when some characters are written for the purpose 
of a funeral which cannot be expected in advance, and 
different characters are written on different cloths or 
fabrics, considerable trouble is required. Furthermore, 
it may be difficult to find a person who is capable of 
writing well (i.e. is good at
