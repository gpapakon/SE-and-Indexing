<ABSTRACT>
A method of bleaching sulphate pulp without using chlorine-containing bleaching agents. The sulphate pulp is oxygen delignified and can possibly also be ozone delignified to a kappa number below 9.5. Thereafter a pretreatment with complexing agent is carried out for 1-60 minutes, at which the pulp consistency is 1-15 %, the temperature 70-110  DEG C and pH 5-7. The pulp thus pretreated is washed and dewatered to a consistency of 18-40 %. Thereafter peroxide bleaching in alkaline environment takes place in the presence of silicate or an organic complexing agent of the type phosphonic or carboxylic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of delignifying and 
bleaching of sulphate pulp without using bleaching agents 
containing chlorine. The method comprises oxygen delignification 
and possibly ozone delignification of the pulp and subsequent 
peroxide bleaching. The technique of bleaching chemical pulps is now 
developing rapidly, because the bleaching chemicals heretofore 
mainly used, Cl2, C102, and hypochlorite, are feared to give rise 
to products being a risk for the environment and health. Until now, the discussions have been concentrated on the, 
emissions of chlorinated organic substance to the recipient. The 
majority of the countries in the world have now established 
limit values for these emissions, which normally are measured as 
AOX (Adsorbable organic halogens). As a new trend, the customers 
require to an ever increasing degree paper with a low content of 
chlorinated organic substance. Conventional bleaching with Cl2 disappears now more and 
more, and Cl2 is replaced primarily by Cl02. Bleaching with Cl02 
causes substantially lower AOX-emissions to the recipient, but 
the amount of chlorinated substance in the pulp is affected only 
insignificantly. In recent years, the use of hydrogen peroxide at the 
bleaching of chemical pulps has increased considerably. Hydrogen 
peroxide can replace part of the chlorine chemicals. In EP-A-402 335 a method is described at which the pulp 
is pretreated with complexing agent under neutral conditions. By 
this process, coniferous sulphate pulp can be bleached with 
peroxide-containing bleaching agents to 70-75% ISO at about 10% 
pulp consistency. In order to achieve fully bleached pulp 
qualities with higher ISO-brightness (above 83% ISO), this 
process can be combined with final bleaching with Cl02. As a 
result, this final bleaching then yields emission of AOX from 
the bleach plant and chlorinated organic substance in the 
bleached pulp. Other known methods of reducing emissions of chlorinated 
organic substance to the recipient are to extend the 
delignification further in the closed part of the mill, i.e. in 
the digester house and/or oxygen step.  
 Extended digestion with maintained pulp quality can be 
achieved by impregnating the chips with black liquor in the 
initial phase of the cook, as described in WO-A- 91/12368. This 
method renders it possible to digest pulp down to a kappa number 
of about 10 and obtain strength properties equal to or better 
than with pulp digested to conventional level, kappa number 
25-30. Combined with oxygen
