<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to rechargeable lithium cells containing non-aqueous electrolytes on the basis of esters, or polymer electrolytes such as polyethylene oxide. A suitable conducting salt is the non-toxic, chemically stable Li tris(fluorosulfonyl)methanide, LiC(SO2F)3. A useful cell electrolyte consists of an approximately 1-molar solution of said salt in a mixture of 50% by volume of ethylene carbonate (EC) and 50% by volume of diethyl carbonate (DEC). Its conductivity is 6.55.10
