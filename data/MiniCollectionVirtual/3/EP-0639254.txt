<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method in small-power plant use for intensification of the operation of the power plant. The order of magnitude of the small power plant is in the range of 3... 30 MWe. In the method, the flue gases (L2) are removed out of connection with the boiler structure so that the last heat face at which the flue gases deliver heat is the economizer (16) placed in the boiler structure. The flue gases are removed from the boiler at a temperature of 95  DEG C... 150  DEG C. In the method, the combustion air is introduced into the furnace (M) as pre-heated while for the pre-heating of the combustion air using exclusively the condensing heat of the bled steam or back-pressure steam of the turbine or supply water that has been heated by said steams.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method of operating a small-power plant. A traditional steam power plant consists of a steam boiler and a steam turbine 
circuit. In optimization of a traditional steam power plant, the ultimate temperature 
of the flue gas and the temperature of the supply water passing into the boiler are 
considered as the criteria of dimensioning. In practice. first the temperature of the 
supply water of the steam turbine is optimized based on known criteria. in which, 
e.g., the values of fresh steam, the pressure in the condenser, and the number of 
pre-heating stages are taken into account. After this, the ultimate temperature of the 
flue gases of the boiler is optimized by dimensioning the flue-gas heat exchanger 
used for pre-heating of the combustion air so that the desired ultimate temperature 
of the flue gas is obtained. The flue-gas heat exchanger is a heat exchanger in which 
the material flow that is cooled is the flue gas and the material flow that is heated is 
the combustion air. Attempts are made to construct the small power plants so that their wirings are 
simple. in order that their specific investment should not become excessively high. 
The most significant economies are obtained when the flue-gas heat exchanger of the 
boiler is omitted. The consequence is a change in the principles of optimization of 
the plant. In view of the efficiency of the plant, also then, the most important 
quantity to be optimized is the ultimate temperature of the flue gases of the boiler. 
Now. the temperature of the supply water cannot be chosen freely, but its value 
depends on the ultimate temperature of the flue gases. In practice, the temperature 
of the supply water is 105 °C ... 135 °C. In this connection, a small power plant is understood as meaning either a condensing 
power plant that produces electricity or a heating power plant that produces both  
 
electricity and heat, being of an order of magnitude of 3...30 MWe. The main 
process in a small power plant consists of the whole constituted by the steam boiler 
and by the steam turbine. The steam boiler includes an economizer, a vaporizer, and 
superheaters. The steam turbine process comprises a steam turbine. a condenser or 
a district-heating heat exchanger, a supply-water tank, and a condensate pump and 
a supply-water pump. The efficiency of a simple small power plant is rather low. The efficiency of the 
production of electricity in a condensing plant is about 32 %, and the construction 
ratio of a district-heating power

 and said small power plant comprising a furnace 
(M) and a steam turbine (17) fitted to drive an electric 

generator (18) for producing electricity, and in which the 
water of the steam turbine circuit is circulated from the 

steam turbine (17) into an economizer (16) placed in a boiler 
(10), from the economizer (16) to a vaporizer (15) and 

further from the vaporizer (15) to a superheater (14), which 
are placed in connection with the boiler structure, and the 

superheated steam is transferred from the superheater (14) to 
the steam turbine (17) to rotate the electric generator (18),
characterized in that
the flue gases (L

) are removed out of connection with the 
boiler structure so that the last heat exchange surface at 

which the flue gases deliver heat is the economizer (16) 
placed in the boiler structure, 
and that the flue gases are removed from the boiler at a 
temperature of 95°C ... 150°C, 
and that the combustion air is introduced into the furnace 
(M) in preheated form whereby for the pre-heating of the 

combustion air exclusively the condensing heat of bled steam 
or back-pressure steam of the turbine or supply water that 

has been heated by said steams is used; the combustion air 
being introduced into the furnace (M) at a temperature of 

80°C ... 120°C.
