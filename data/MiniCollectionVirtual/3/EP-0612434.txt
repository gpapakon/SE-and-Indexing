<DESCRIPTION>
Filling-in paste for electronic componentsField of the inventionThe invention refers to the filling-in paste for elec¬ tronic components, which ensures tight and elastic filling -up of component, with perfect insulation from unfavourable influences of external environment, and at the same time it ensures the good thermal conductivity and the practical self-suppression.Background of the inventionEpoxide-reεinε, asphalts, polyurethane-reεinε and simi¬ lar compounds are used as filling-in pastes for electronic components. These compounds are applied with various fil¬ lers, accelerators and dryers, which influence their elec¬ trical, mechanical and chemical features and also the self -suppression. The problem is complicated with filling-in paste preparation, high price and with harmonizing of all required properties. These compounds have mostly antagonis¬ tic properties - for example the good insulation properties, but the considerable internal stress during the hardening process for example at epoxide-reεinε, combined often with an exotherm reaction. The following example can the patent SU 430 124, which employs toluene as a solvent to the mix¬ ture of ricine-oil and aliphatic aromatic diizocyanate; that causes however the considerable extension of hardening time and toluene is into the bargain very harmful. The problems connected with ecology and safety standards occur by present -day filling-in pastes last but not least. 

Summary of the inventionThe disadvantages of till used filling-in pastes are sol- ved by the filling-in paste of this invention. Substance of the invention of the filling-in paste for electronic compo¬ nents iε, that it concerns product of reaction anhydrous ri¬ cine-oil and polyizocyanate-reεin; for this resin is advan¬ tageously used aromatic polyizocyanate with the main compo¬ nent triphenilmethan - 4,4?4" - triizocyanate in ratio 100 weight parts of ricine-oil and ?5 weight parts of polyizo- cyanate-resin. The filling-in paste is hardened at tempera¬ ture range 0 - 75°C for the duration 20 minutes till 6 hours as required.The advantage of the filling-in paste opposite the well-known mixtures iε, that it contains no harmful organic solvents as toluene, it shortens the hardening time at lower temperatures without demands on the following hardening: and it shows very good result properties, as dielectric and ele- ctroinsulating properties, heat conductivity and resistance, mechanical elasticity, gas and steam airtightnesε. and also very good adhesion to common used materials.The
