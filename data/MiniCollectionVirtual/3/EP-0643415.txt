<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method of using a quadrupole ion
trap (QIT) for multigeneration collision induced dissociation (CID).In a 1952 paper by Paul, et al, the QIT and a slightly different device
called the quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) were first disclosed. Mass
spectrometers were known earlier but the QMS was the first mass
spectrometer which did not require the use of a large magnet but used radio
frequency fields instead for separation of ions of a sample, i.e., performing
mass analysis. Mass spectrometers are devices for making precise
determinations of the constituents of a material by providing separations of
all the different masses in a sample according to their mass (m) to charge
(e) ratio (m/e). Mass spectrometers need to first disassociate/fragment a
sample into charged atoms, i.e., ions, or molecularly bound group of atoms
and then employ some mechanism for determining the M/e ratio of those
fragments.The QMS mechanism for separating ions relies on the fact
that within a specifically shaped structure, radio frequency fields can
be made to interact with an ion within the structure so that the
resultant force on the ion is a restoring force which causes certain 
ions to oscillate about some referenced position. The QIT is
capable of providing restoring forces on selected ions in three
orthogonal directions. This is the reason that it is called a trap.
Ions so trapped can be retained for relatively long periods of time
which enables various operations and experiments on selected ions.By changing one of the QIT parameters, it is possible to
cause consecutive values of m/e of stored ions in the trap to become
unstable and to pass those ions into a detector. The detected ion
current signal intensity, as a function of the scan parameter, is the
mass spectrum of the trapped ions.Techniques are available to isolate an ion by scanning the
QIT and to eject all ions except ions of a certain selected m/e value.
If those isolated ions are considered a "parent", and they are further
disassociated by some technique, "daughter" ions are formed which
can be analyzed, or a single daughter ion can be isolated and
further "daughters" obtained. This is known as MS/MS or MSn
spectroscopy.The preferred technique for further ion disassociation is a
gentle ionization method called Collision Induced Disassociation
(CID). The usual technique to obtain CID as described by Syka in
U.S. Patent 4,736,101 is to cause the ion to be excited at the secular
frequency for the selected mass to increase the
