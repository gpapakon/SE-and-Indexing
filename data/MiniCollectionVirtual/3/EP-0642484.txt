<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing normal alpha olefins having low saturates content, said process comprising: a) contacting a trialkyl aluminum compound and ethylene under alpha olefin formation conditions thereby producing a mixture comprising normal alpha olefins and tri (higher) alkyl aluminum compounds; b) contacting at least a portion of said mixture and sufficient ethylene, in the presence of a Group VIII metal- containing transalkylation catalyst, thereby transalkylating substantially all of said tri (higher) alkyl aluminum compounds, said transalkylation catalyst being used in an amount and under conditions which cause transalkylation of said tri (higher) alkyl aluminum compounds, but not isomerization of said normal alpha olefins; and c) contacting the product of step b) with a sufficient amount of aqueous caustic and water, to produce an organic phase and an aqueous phase, wherein said organic phase is substantially metal-free.

<DESCRIPTION>
Normal alpha olefins (NAO) are produced commercially using
ethylene and trialkyl aluminum compounds. The preferred
trialkyl aluminum compound is triethyl aluminum (TEA). In
this oligomerization or "growth" reaction, a hydrocarbon
group, for example, an alkyl group on an aluminum atom
containing n ethylene units, can add an ethylene molecule to
become an alkyl group of n+1 ethylene units. Different
alkyl groups on the aluminum atom can contain different
numbers of ethylene units. In order to distinguish them
from the original trialkyl aluminum catalysts, the products
of this oligomerization reaction will be referred to herein
as "tri(higher)alkyl aluminum compounds."The tri(higher)alkyl aluminum compounds are subjected to a
transalkylation (sometimes called a "displacement") reaction
which occurs concurrently with the oligomerization reaction,
thereby forming alpha olefins. This transalkylation
consists of two steps. These are, first, thermal
decomposition of the tri(higher)alkyl aluminum compounds
into an aluminum hydride and alpha olefin(s), followed by
rapid reaction of the hydride with the excess ethylene in
the reaction mixture to regenerate an ethyl group on the
aluminum which can start another oligomerization cycle. The resulting mixture comprises alpha olefins,
triethylaluminum, and some amount of residual
tri(higher)alkyl aluminum compound(s) which have not
undergone the transalkylation reaction. This mixture is
subjected to caustic treatment (hydrolysis) to decompose the
triethylaluminum compounds. Unfortunately, this hydrolysis
also decomposes the residual tri(higher)alkyl aluminum
compounds, which typically results in a product containing
about 1 to 1.5 weight percent, based on the weight of the
product, of undesired saturated alkanes ("saturates" or
"paraffins") in the product, rather than a product which
contains only the desired alpha olefins. Because these
saturates have boiling points close to the desired alpha
olefins, they are very difficult to remove from the product
by, e.g., distillation.The resulting mixture is separated into an aqueous and an
organic phase, and, after settling, the organic phase is
water-scrubbed (to remove residual caustic and aluminum
compounds) and distilled to give the various even-numbered
alpha olefin cuts from C4 up through C30 and higher. The
normal alpha olefins produced, particularly the C12, C14, and
C16 alpha olefins, have utility for the production of
detergents. The C4, C6 and C8 olefins are useful for
preparing linear low density polyethylene. The

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing normal alpha olefins having low
saturates content, said process comprising:


(a) contacting a trialkyl aluminum compound and
ethylene under alpha-olefin formation conditions

thereby producing a mixture comprising normal
alpha olefins and tri(higher)alkyl aluminum

compounds;
(b) contacting at least a portion of said mixture and
sufficient ethylene, in the presence of a

nickel-containing transalkylation catalyst

thereby transalkylating substantially all of said
tri(higher)alkyl aluminum compounds, said

transalkylation catalyst being used in an amount sufficient to provide a concentration of 10-200 parts per billion by weight nickel, based on total weight
and under conditions which cause transalkylation

of said tri(higher)alkyl aluminum compounds, but
not isomerization of said normal alpha olefins;

and
(c) contacting the product of step (b) with a sufficient amount
of aqueous caustic and water or aqueous acid and water, to

produce an organic phase containing the normal alpha olefins and an aqueous phase, wherein
said organic phase is substantially metal-free.
The process of Claim 1, wherein the nickel
catalyst is used at concentrations of 20 to

60 parts per billion.
The process of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the
nickel compound is nickel octanoate.
The process of Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
trialkyl aluminum compound is triethylaluminum.
A method according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, further comprising : 

(d) separating the resulting mixture of step (c) into an aqueous
phase and an organic phase; and
(e) contacting said organic phase with water in
sufficient quantity and for a sufficient amount of

time to produce a normal alpha olefin stream which
is substantially free of said aluminum compounds

and said Group VIII metal transalkylation
catalyst.
