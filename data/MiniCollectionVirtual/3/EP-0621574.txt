<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a textured emblem (1) having an 
identification mark (2) such as a trademark. Said mark is 

made of thread having inorganic fluorescent material applied 
thereon which will emit light when subjected to illumination 

with ultraviolet radiation. The invention also provides a 
forgery-preventing printed emblem (1) comprising a strip of 

textile fabric of natural, synthetic and or chemical fibers 
bearing an identification mark (2). Said mark is indicated 

by coating portions of the strip of fabric with resin liquid 
containing inorganic fluorescent material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to textured or printed 
emblems bearing trademarks, distributors' names, 
manufacturers' names or the like which may be applied to 
garments, etc.. Heretofore, the prior art has employed peculiar woven 
textures, special colors and/or peculiar styles of letters 
for the purpose of preventing forgery of trademarks, etc. 
on textured or printed emblems . While identification marks such as trademarks have 
heretofore been made in the form of textured emblems, 
printed names or labels, all of them can be easily forged in 
that if samples were given, it was possible to easily 
produce counterfeits which could not readily be 
distinguished form the real. Should articles having forged trademarks or the like 
affixed thereon be found to be poor in quality, the 
distributors or manufacturers would be obliged, in some 
instances, to accept returned goods, resulting in badly 
impairing the distributors' or manufacturers' credit. For this reason, it was a common practice in the past to 
make emblems such as trademarks by the use of peculiar woven 
textures, special colors and/or peculiar styles of letters 
in an attempt to prevent forgery. Nevertheless, the method 
of manufacture could be found out by analyzing the structure 
and/or constituents, so that such emblems could easily be 
imitated and it was hard to discern fakes. Accordingly, the present invention contemplates providing 
a forgery-preventing textured or printed emblem formed of a 
special material which makes it possible to detect any 
counterfeit despite any resemblance in appearance. In one aspect, the present invention provides a forgery-preventing 
textured emblem having an identification mark 
such as letters, figures and/or other indicia woven 
thereinto, the mark being made of thread having inorganic 
fluorescent material applied thereon. In another aspect, the present invention provides a 
forgery-preventing printed emblem comprising a strip of 
textile fabric of natural, synthetic and or chemical fibers 
bearing an identification mark such as letters, figures and/ 
or other indicia, the mark being indicated by coating 
portions of the strip of fabric with resin liquid containing 
inorganic fluorescent material. The forgery-preventing textured emblem according to the 
present invention will appear white or in an other particular 
color under the visible light, but due to the mark such as 
trademark formed of inorganic fluorescent material-coated 
thread being woven into the emblem, illumination of the 
emblem with
