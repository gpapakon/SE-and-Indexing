A process for the preparation of alkyl fluorobenzoates 
of the formula (I) 


 
in which R is an alkyl radical and F
n
 is 1 to 4 
fluorine atoms which, indep
endently of one another, 
are bonded to the aromatic ring, which comprises 

reacting a fluorobenzoyl chloride of the formula 
(II) 


 
in which F
n
 is as defined above, with an at least 
stoichiometric amount of an alkali metal alcoholate 

ROM, in which R is as defined above and M is an 
alkali metal from the group consisting of Li, Na and 

K, in the corresponding alcohol ROH at temperatures 
from -10°C to 150°C, if appropriate distilling off 

the solvent, and separating off the alkali metal 
chloride formed by treating the mixture with water 

or by filtration. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein R is 
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or i-propyl.  

 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein F
n
 
is 1 or 2 fluorine atoms. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 3, wherein the alkali metal alcoholate ROM is 

introduced into the alcohol ROH and the acid 
chloride is added dropwise at temperatures from 

-10°C to the boiling point of the alcohol, in 
particular 10°C to the boiling point of the alcohol. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 4, wherein the concentration of the alkali metal 

alcoholate in the alcohol is 1 to 60% by weight, in 
particular 10 to 50% by weight, preferably 20 to 40% 

by weight. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein 1.0 to 5.0 mol, in particular 1.0 to 

3.0 mol, preferably 1.0 to 1.5 mol, of alcoholate 
are employed per mol of acid chloride. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 6, wherein stirring of the mixture is continued 

at -10°C to boiling point of the alcohol, in particular 
10°C to boiling point of the alcohol, preferably 

10°C to 40°C. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 7, wherein, for working-up, the mixture is 

diluted with water and the product is isolated by 
phase separation. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 8, wherein excess alcohol is distilled off before 

water is added. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 6, wherein the product is isolated by filtering 

off the alkali metal salt and subsequent removal of  
 

the alcohol by distillation.
