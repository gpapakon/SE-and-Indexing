<ABSTRACT>
A cable bolt (3) comprises a central wire (5), a plurality of core members (7) positioned at spaced intervals along the length of the central wire (5), and a plurality of outer wires (9) wound around the central wire (5) and the spaced apart core members (7) so that the width of the cable bolt (3) is greater at the locations of the core members (7) than at the sections between the core members (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
 CABLE BOLTThe present invention relates to a cable bolt for use in the ground stabilisation.Cable bolts are used in a number of different applications in the mining and civil industries, such as for underground stoping, pillar support, development support and in open pit and civil applications where slope stabilisation is required. In general, cable bolts are used by drilling holes through potentially unstable ground into more solid strata into which the cable bolts are located securely by grouting.In some situations, cable bolts are located to extend through the ore body to be mined and are at least partially exposed as the ore body around the cable bolts is removed by blasting. In other situations, cable bolts are located to extend through potentially unstable material which is not part of the ore body to be mined and, by stabilising the material, the cable bolts prevent such material mixing with the ore body to be mined and thereby increasing the volume to be processed and accordingly the costs of winning the valuable minerals.A basic form of conventional hitherto widely- used cable bolt (hereinafter referred to as the "basic form of cable bolt") comprises a central wire and a plurality of outer wires (typically 6 or more) wound around the central wire in parallel spirals. The wires are usually formed from high tensile strength steel, and usually the cable bolt is stress relieved after it is formed.The foregoing basic form of cable bolt has been found to have relatively low load transfer with the result that over time the mechanical interlock between cable bolt and grout is substantially reduced. 

 In order to improve the load transfer capability it is known to use a barrel and wedge assembly with the basic form of cable bolt. However, this has not proven to be altogether successful in terms of performance and also is a relatively expensive technique. It is also known to swage steel blocks at spaced intervals along the length of the basic form of cable bolt. Whilst this technique has proven to be successful in terms of improving load transfer, the costs are unacceptably high. A further known approach to improve the load transfer capability is to modify the configuration of the basic form of cable bolt. The modified form, known as a "birdcage", comprises a plurality of enlarged diameter regions along the length of the cable bolt formed by selectively unwinding the cable bolt at the regions so that the wires can separate and bulge outwardly.Whilst this technique is successful in terms of performance,

CLAIMS :
1. A cable bolt comprising, a central wire, a plurality of core members positioned at spaced intervals along the length of the central wire, and a plurality of outer wires wound around the central wire and the spaced apart core members so that the width of the cable bolt is greater at the locations of the core members than at the sections between the core members.
2. The cable bolt defined in claim 1, wherein the central wire and the outer wire are formed from steel.
3. The cable bolt defined in claim 1 or claim 2, comprising 6 or more outer wires.
4. The cable bolt defined in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the core member comprises a relatively wide middle section and relatively narrow ends and a central passage extending from end to end for receiving the central wire therethrough.
5. The cable bolt defined in claim 4, wherein the core member tapers from the middle section to each end.
6. The cable bolt defined in claim 4 or claim 5, wherein the core member is formed from a plurality of longitudinal sections which fit together around the central wire.
7. The cable bolt defined in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the core member is formed from substantially incompressible material. 


8. The cable bolt defined in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the core member increases the diameter of the central wire by at least 20%.
9. A method of forming a cable bolt comprising, winding a plurality of outer wires around a central wire having a plurality of core members fitted to the central wire at spaced intervals along the length thereof.
10. A method of forming a cable bolt from a basic form of cable bolt comprising a central wire and a plurality of outer wires around the central wire, the method comprising radially displacing the outer wires from the central wire to form a space between the central wire and the outer wires, and fitting a core member to the central wire in the space.
11. The method defined in claim 10, comprising repeating the radial displacement and core member placement steps to fit a plurality of the core members along the length of the central wire.
12. The method defined in any one of claims 9 to 11, further comprising coiling the cable bolt onto a spool.
