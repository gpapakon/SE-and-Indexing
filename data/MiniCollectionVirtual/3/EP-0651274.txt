<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical projection
system; and, more particularly, to an array of M x N thin film
actuated mirrors for use in the system.Among the various video display systems available in the
art, an optical projection system is known to be capable of
providing a high quality display in a large scale. In such an
optical projection system, light from a lamp is uniformly
illuminated onto an array of, e.g., M x N, actuated mirrors
such that each of the mirrors is coupled with each of the
actuators. The actuators may be made of an electrodisplacive
material such as a piezoelectric or an electrostrictive
material which deforms in response to an electric field
applied thereto.The reflected light beam from each of the mirrors is
incident upon an aperture of a baffle. By applying an
electrical signal to each of the actuators, the relative
position of each of the mirrors to the incident light beam is
altered, thereby causing a deviation in the optical path of 
the reflected beam from each of the mirrors. As the optical
path of each of the reflected beams is varied, the amount of
light reflected from each of the mirrors which passes through
the aperture is changed, thereby modulating the intensity of
the beam. The modulated beams through the aperture are
transmitted onto a projection screen via an appropriate
optical device such as a projection lens, to thereby display
an image thereon.In Fig. 1, there is shown a cross sectional view of an
M x N electrodisplacive actuated mirror array 10 for use in an
optical projection system, disclosed in a copending commonly
owned application, U.S. Ser. No. 08/278,472, entitled
"ELECTRODISPLACIVE ACTUATED MIRROR ARRAY, comprising: an
