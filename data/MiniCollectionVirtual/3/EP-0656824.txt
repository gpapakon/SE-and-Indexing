<ABSTRACT>
A distributor head (1) for forming a tubular profile from one or more streams of thermoplastic material, which distributor head comprises at least an inlet orifice (10, 12, 14) for a stream of plastics material, which can be connected to an extruder, and an outlet orifice (20, 22, 24) of annular cross section. The distributor head comprises at least one flow channel system (30, 32, 34) which is connected to an inlet orifice of the distributor head by means of an inlet channel (36, 38, 40), which inlet channel, in a number of stages of branchings and intermediate flow channels (60, 62, 64), branches into a number of outlet channels (66, 68, 70) terminating on a periphery around the centre line of the outlet orifice, which outlet channels open into the outlet orifice.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a distributor head for 
forming a tubular profile from one or more streams of 
extruded thermoplastic material according to the preamble 
of claim 1. In many cases, extruders which are connected at their 
output side to a distributor head are used to produce 
tubular profiles from thermoplastic materials. In the case 
of profiles having a wall consisting of a single layer, 
said distributor head is generally positioned in line with 
the extruder, so that the material stream from the extruder 
passes through in a virtually rectilinear manner. For 
certain applications and materials, distributor heads are 
also known in which the direction of the material stream is 
altered. Said distributor heads are generally referred to 
as "crossheads". In comparison with the aforementioned 
distributor heads which are positioned in line with an 
extruder and which are also known as "straight heads", 
crossheads of this type have the advantage, inter alia, 
that the interior of the extruded tube can be accessed 
easily, for example in order to fit a cooled core.  
 
DE-U-1 927 405 discloses such a crosshead, which publication serves 
as the basis for the preamble of claim 1. The flow channel system 
of this known crosshead is formed through providing a pattern of 
grooves in the outer surface of a cylindrical mandrel of the head. 
This mandrel fits thight in an annular body of the crosshead. Due to this design the flow channels of this known crosshead 
have a curvature corresponding to the diameter of the mandrel, when 
considering the cross-section of the head. Furthermore the flow 
channels have a rectangular cross-section with sharp corners. The 
curvature of the flow channels and the sharp corners lead to non-uniformity 
of the flow of the plastic material. 
In the case of another known distributor head in which 
at least one inlet orifice is positioned at an angle to the 
centre  
 
line of the associated outlet orifice, the material stream 
fed in through this inlet orifice is separated in an 
annular chamber into a number of branch streams and 
downstream thereof, said branch streams are combined to 
form a closed ring at the outlet orifice. 
The material introduced into this distributor head at the 
respective inlet orifice flows to the associated outlet 
orifice along different paths. The disadvantage in this 
case is that these flow paths have a mutually different 
flow resistance. In addition, the fact that the length of 
the different flow paths may differ appreciably is

Distributor head (1) for forming a tubular profile from 
one or more streams of thermoplastic material, which distributor 

head comprises at least one flow channel system (30,32,34) for 
a stream of thermoplastic material, which flow channel system 

extends between an inlet orifice (10,12,14), which can be

 distributor head (1) comprises 
a plurality of successive axial bodies (2,3,4) each being 

provided with all the flow channels corresponding to a single 
branching stage of the flow channel system.

orifices. 
Distributor head according to one or more of the preceding

increases in such a manner that the flow rate of a material 
stream in the first or second zone increases or decreases,
