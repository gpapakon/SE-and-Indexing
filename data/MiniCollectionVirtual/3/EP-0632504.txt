<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, in particular a 
diodelaser, comprising II-VI semiconductor materials. 
The known device does not possess a good ohmic contact between a 
semiconductor layer, comprising e.g ZnSe, and a metal layer, comprising e.g. gold. 
The semiconductor device according to the invention is characterized in 
that the device comprises between the semiconductor layer and the metal layer a further 

semiconductor layer is provided that comprises BeTe and has in the direction from the 
metal layer towards the semiconductor layer a graded composition from BeTe to the II-VI 

material of the semiconductor layer. Such a device possesses a very good ohmic 
contact and therefore a very low contact resistance. 
Preferably the graded composition from BeTe to the II-VI material of the 
semiconductor layer is obtained by a stack of alternating (thin) layers of BeTe and the 

II-VI material, e.g. ZnSe. The relative thickness of each layer within each pair of two 
subsequent layers is graded in such a way that the effective composition within the stack 

is graded according to the invention. Excellent results are obtainable with such a device. 
Moreover, it is relatively simple to fabricate using e.g. MBE in a digital way, thus 

avoiding e.g. Te and Se segregation at the growth surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, in particular to 
diode lasers comprising Group II-IV compound semiconductors. The successful p-type doping of ZnSe using nitrogen radicals as a dopant 
during molecular beam epitaxy growth has rapidly lead to the demonstration of blue-green 
laser diodes. See for example R.M. Park et al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 57,2127, 
(1990); K. Ohkawa et al, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 30, L152 (1991); M.A. Haase et al, 
Appl. Phys. Lett. 59,1273 (1991); and H. Leon et al, Appl. Phys. Lett 59, 3619 
(1991). Perhaps the most important obstacle preventing widespread use of these 
ZnSe-based blue-green lasers and maturing of this technology is the difficulty in 
fabricating low resistivity Ohmic contacts to p-type, normal thickness ZnSe-based 
cladding layers, (eg, ZnSe, ZnSxSe1-x and Zn1-xMgxSySe1-y). Gold (Au) electrodes which 
are typically involved in the formation of electrical contacts, form a Schottky barrier on 
p-ZnSe in excess of 1.0 eV and no metal that has a work function that is high enough to 
lower that barrier has been found. Since ZnSe: N layers can be doped at most (so far) 
in the low 1018 cm-3 range, a realization of tunnelling metal-semiconductor junctions for 
electrical contact purposes is extremely difficult and has not been feasible. There is thus 
a need for an alternative solution to the problem. Reduction of the valence band affinity 
of the semiconductor near the surface by use of a graded gap semiconductor layer 
comes to mind as one method that may prove to be successful. Such a technique for 
producing Ohmic contact to n-GaAs has been reported. (See J. M. Woodall et al, J. 
Vac. Sci. Technol., 19, 626, (1981).:1. Recently, several groups reported some progress in improving electrical 
contacts to p-ZnSe. For example,there have been developed: ZnSe:N contact layers by  
 
lowering the substrate temperature during molecular beam epitaxy growth to 150°C, 
and using a cracked Se source (J. Qui et al, Proceedings of VII MBE Conference 
Schwabisch Gemund, Germany, Aug. 24-28,1992); a ZnSe/ZnTe multilayer structure 
used for a contact layer to achieve a graded band gap effect from p-ZnSe to p-ZnTe (Y. 
Fan et al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 61, 3161, 1992); improved electrical contact to p-ZnSe by 
use of high affinity, semi-metallic HgSe, grown by MBE (Y. Lansari et al, Appl. Phys. 
Lett. 61,2554, 1992. Although these improved contacts permitted performing Hall 
measurements on p-ZnSe, to date they have not reduced the operating voltage of blue-green 
lasers to
