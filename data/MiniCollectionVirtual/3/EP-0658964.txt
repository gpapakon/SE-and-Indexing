<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switching installation, preferably for medium voltage, having gas-tight metal encapsulation in the form of a switchgear cabinet, having a power circuit breaker, preferably a vacuum power circuit breaker, having at least one switch pole (27), having busbars (41 to 43), voltage converters, current transformers and earthing switches. Each switch pole (27) of the power circuit breaker is accommodated in a housing (29) which is separated from the remaining switching installation area in a gas-tight manner, can be closed at the front and whose interior is connected to the switching installation area by means of at least one bypass line (38) (which can be shut off), such that the bypass line (38) can be shut off for inspection of the switch pole (27) and, after this, the housing (29) can be opened and the switch pole (27) can be withdrawn.

<CLAIMS>
Switchgear assembly having a gastight metal 
encapsulation in the form of a cubicle, a circuit breaker 

which has at least one switch pole, preferably a vacuum 
circuit breaker, having busbars, voltage converters, 

current transformers and earthing switches, characterized 
in that each switch pole (27) of the circuit breaker is 

accommodated in an enclosure (29) which is separated in 
a gastight manner from the rest of the switchgear 

assembly area (39) and can be closed at the front, and 
whose interior is connected to the switchgear assembly 

area by means of at least one bypass line (38) which can 
be shut off such that, in order to maintain the switch 

pole, the bypass line can be shut off and, after this, 
the enclosure can be opened and the switch pole can be 

removed. 
Switchgear assembly according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that current feeders (25) are introduced into 

the enclosure (29), whose inner ends are designed as 
contact pieces which interact with mating contact pieces 

on the switch pole matched to them in such a manner that 
the switch pole can be removed from the enclosure at the 

front. 
Switchgear assembly according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that one contact piece (25) is arranged on the 

base of the enclosure and can make contact with the fixed 
contact piece (26) in the switch pole (27), and the other 

contact piece can be coupled to the moving contact piece 
(30) of the switch pole (27). 
Switchgear assembly according to one of the  
 

preceding claims, characterized in that the closure cover 
(40) for the enclosure (29) is at the same time fitted 

with the drive (33) for the switch pole (27). 
Switchgear assembly according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a current transformer 

(80) is provided, surrounding the contact piece 
(25), in the region of the base (28) of the enclosure 

(29). 
Switchgear assembly according to the precharacterizing 
clause of Claim 1, in particular according to 

one of the preceding claims, characterized in that each 
switch pole (27) of the circuit breaker is accommodated 

in an enclosure (29) which is separated in a gastight 
manner from the rest of the switchgear assembly area 

(39), in that, in order to achieve earthing, each 
enclosure (29) is mounted within the switchgear assembly 

such that it can rotate and has on its outer surface 
diametrically opposite contact tabs (50, 51) which can 

make contact with the busbars (41, 42, 43) in one 
rotation position of the enclosures (29) and, in another 

rotation position, can make contact with the contact tabs 
of the adjacent enclosures or, if the switch poles are 

located externally, with earthing contact pieces (52, 53) 
which are fitted on the side wall of the switchgear 

assembly. 
Switchgear assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that an isolating switch (62) is 

fitted on the outer surface of each enclosure and 
connects the switch pole (27) to the associated busbar 

(41, 42, 43) in a first position, and connects it to 
earth in a second position. 
Switchgear assembly according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the isolating switch is a rotary 

isolating switch. 
Switchgear assembly according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the isolating switch (62) is an in-line 

isolating switch.
