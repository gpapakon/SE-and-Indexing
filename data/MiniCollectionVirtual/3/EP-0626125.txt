<ABSTRACT>
A process (1) for printing a printed circuit board (4, 4a, 4b) by means of a mask (5) and of a doctor blade (9) has a support (3) for positioning the printed circuit board (4) and a frame (22) for holding the mask (5). The cross section of the frame (22) is smaller than the surface of the printed circuit board (4) which bears the connecting points (43) for electronic components. An adjusting device (2, X, Y) allows the printed circuit board (4, 4a, 4b) and the frame (22) to be adjusted or moved with respect to each other in a direction parallel to the surface.

Apparatus (1) for printing a circuitry carrier 

(4,4a,4b) by means of a stencil (5) and a wiper (9), 
consisting of a support (3) for positioning the circuitry 

carrier (4) and a frame (22) on which the stencil (5) is 
held,
 
characterised in that,
 
the cross-sectional dimensions of the frame (22) are 

smaller than the surface of the circuitry carrier (4) 
having the connection points (43) for electronic 

components, and an adjustment device (2,X,Y) is provided 
for a relative displacement or adjustment between circuitry 

carrier (4,4a,4b) and frame (22) parallel to the surface. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
the frame (22) is internally adapted to the size of the 

connection point (43), and is preferably also adapted to 
the form thereof, in particular slightly larger. 
Apparatus according to claim 2,
 
characterised by
 
a displacement device (Z) for a relative displacement 

between circuitry carrier (4,4a,4b) and frame (22) 
transversely of, in particular at right angles to, the 

surface of the connection point (43). 
Apparatus in particular according to any preceding 
claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
respective mounting devices or a common mounting device 

(7,58) are/is associated with the frame (22) and the wiper 
(9) . 
Apparatus in particular according to any preceding  
 

claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
relative to the stencil (5), the wiper (9) is mounted 

rotatably about its axis (59) and/or vertically 
displaceably and/or horizontally displaceably and 

preferably thereby displaceably on an in particular closed 
loop (50) whose form and size correspond to the form and 

size of the pad configuration. 
Apparatus according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that,
 
the rotatable wiper (9) is releasably fixable in one or 

more, in particular four, rotational positions. 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6,
 
characterised in that,
 
the wiper (9) is urged against the stencil (5) by a biasing 

force. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 5 to 7,
 
characterised in that,
 
there is associated therewith a guide device (9c,22) for 

displacement on the loop (50). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
the frame (22) and preferably also the wiper (9) is or are 

each in the associated mount (7,65) displaceable between a 
working position on the circuitry carrier (4) and an in 

particular upwardly displaced parking position. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
there is associated therewith a magnification device (44) 

for representing a magnified image of one or two, 
preferably opposing, parts of the stencil holes (5a), in 

particular having an imaging device (44b) arranged above  
 

the frame (22) and a monitor (44a). 
Apparatus according to claim 10,
 
characterised in that,
 
the imaging device (44b) or a magnifying optical system 

(47a) is displaceably mounted in a space above the parking 
position freeing the frame (22). 
Apparatus in particular according to any preceding 
claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
with the employment of a three-dimensional circuitry 

carrier (4a,4b), having mutually transversely or obliquely 
arranged surfaces (93a,93b) for connection points (43), the 

mounting device for the circuitry carrier (4b) or the 
printing device (5,9) is pivotable relative to one another 

and positionable in the relevant pivot disposition. 
Process for printing a circuitry carrier (4,4a,4b) 
with bonding paste at connection points (43) for electronic 

components, in which, by means of a wiper (9), the bonding 
paste on a stencil (5) held on a frame (22) is spread 

through stencil holes (5a) onto the circuitry carrier 
(4,4a,4b),
 
characterised in that,
 
with use of a frame (22) whose size corresponds to only a 

part of the surface of the circuitry carrier having the 
connection points (43), the circuitry carrier is locally 

printed and then at least one or all further local parts 
(43) are correspondingly printed one after another.
