<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of telechels by reacting preferably polyfunctional "living" polymers obtained by anionic polymerisation with a functionalising agent, characterised in that the reaction is carried out with stirring with a stirrer having knife-like blades as stirring elements, where the stirring elements are inclined with respect to their plane of motion and essentially pass over the entire space occupied by the reaction mixture.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a telechele by 
reacting, preferably, a polyfunctional, living 

polymer obtained by anionic polymerization with a 
functionalizing agent, wherein the reaction is 

carried out while stirring with a stirrer having 
knife-like blades as stirring elements, the latter 

being inclined relative to their plane of movement 
and passing over essentially the complete space 

occupied by the reaction mixture. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein an epoxide 
is used as the functionalizing agent. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the living 
polymer contains styrene, butadiene and/or isoprene 

units.
