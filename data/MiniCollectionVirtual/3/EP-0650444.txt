<ABSTRACT>
A container closer (10) particularly for use on screw top containers such as carbonated beverage containers, the container closure (10) having a generally cylindrical continuous tamper evident band (11) joined by a plurality of frangible bridges (13) to the free edge of a skirt (16) of the closure (10). The band (11) has a segmented internal rib (18) which engages an external retaining flange of the container when the closure (10) is applied to the container so that on removal of the closure (10) the tamper evident band (11) remains on the container or is visually clearly damaged by removal of the closure (10) from the container. The band (11) is provided with longitudinal reinforcement by projections (25 and 28) or other areas of thickening (26) to provide the band (11) with longitudinal stiffness while still permitting it to expand over the retaining flange on the container. The rib (18) has a first annular side (21), the first annular side (21) having a compound surface comprising a radially outer frusto-conical portion (23) which assists in the molding of the rib (18) and a radially inner substantially planar portion (24) which increases the difficulty of removing the closure (10) intact from the container without rupturing the bridges joining the tamper evident band (11) from the remainder of the closure (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to closures for containers
having an externally screw threaded neck and
more particularly to such closures which are formed
with a tamper evident band.Manufacturers of foodstuffs, beverages, medicaments,
dentifrice and the like are concerned to ensure
that products they place on the market are not tampered
with before being opened by the ultimate consumer of
the goods. For this purpose it has become conventional
to include in closures for such goods means which will
indicate whether the closure has been tampered with
before purchase. In the case of containers having an
externally screw threaded neck it is common to provide
the closure with a tamper evident band which engages
behind a retaining flange formed on the neck of the container.
The tamper evident band is joined to a depending
skirt forming part of the closure by a number of
frangible bridges. On application of the closure to the
container the band is forced over the retaining flange,
however, when the closure is unscrewed from the container
the bridges are sheared as the band is trapped
behind the retaining flange while the closure moves up
the neck of the container.While such tamper evident bands have been widely
accepted there is a delicate balance between the two
conflicting requirements. On the one hand, one must be
able to apply the closures to containers at very high
speed without inadvertently breaking the bridges, or
breaking or deforming the band itself, or deleteriously
affecting the seal between the closure and the container.
On the other hand, the band must be sufficiently
tightly secured behind the retaining flange and the
bridges and/or the band must be sufficiently easily broken
that the closure cannot be removed from the container
without rupturing the bridges and/or the band.Another problem is that an unauthorized person
might attempt to remove the closure and tamper evident
band, without damaging the band or frangible bridges,
in order to contaminate or replace the container contents
and then reapply the closure. Such operation
might be attempted with the assistance of a thin device,
such as a knife blade, wedged up between the tamper
evident band and the neck of the container to which the
closure has been applied. The devices might then be
levered outwardly in order to expand the inner diameter
of the band so that it may be passed back over the
retaining flange of the container. In such a process the
device will be edged around the circumference of the
band so as to gradually ease the band over
