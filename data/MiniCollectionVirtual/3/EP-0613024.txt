<ABSTRACT>
A sweep frequency vibrator has an elongate 
cylindrical housing (12) closed at the top (16) and bottom 

(14) ends. On the interior, there is a reactionary mass 
(48) fixed to identical upper (42) and lower (44) piston 

ends. They are received in seal isolated chambers (40,56), 
one being formed in a moveable plug (52). The plug is moved 

to thereby vary the spacing of the chambers (40,56). As the 
frequency is changed, the plug (52) is moved to ensure 

sufficient clearance from the excursion of the reactionary 
mass (48). Hydraulic oil under pressure is delivered to 

control valves (30,72), one for each piston end. The two 
control valves (30,72) and piston ends (42,44) preferably 

have very short flow lines, and the excursion permitted for 
the plug ensures operation without bottoming out.

<DESCRIPTION>
A vibrator is a device which is used to form 
vibrations transmitted into the earth in seismic 
investigations. A vibrator is a device that is typically 
installed at the earth's surface to form a vibration which 
is directed into the earth and reflected by various 
geological horizons in the earth to thereby provide data 
indicative of the nature of the seismic formations. The 
propagation of the vibrations into the earth involves a 
propagation of a generally spherical wavefront. Thus, the 
intensity of the energy on a per unit area basis decreases 
with the square of the distance of the propagation. Since 
the signal must be propagated into the earth, reflected at a 
far horizon and return to the surface of the reflected 
signal is subject to a square law decrease, the propagation 
of the signal involves a decrease in intensity which is a 
function of the fourth power of the distance. This can be 
reduced significantly by installing a vibrator in a well 
borehole. Such a vibrator has to be an elongate cylindrical 
structure to fit in the well borehole. Devices of this sort 
typically are hydraulically powered. A vibrator therefore 
is required which converts hydraulic power into vibrations 
for surface and down hole uses. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an available frequency seismic wave generator 
comprising: 
(a) an elongate cylindrical housing having closed 
ends and a diameter enabling said housing to be positioned 
in a well borehole for generating a variable frequency 
seismic signal; (b) a reactionary mass supported by a pair of  
 
opposing piston ends; (c) a first fluid filled chamber means for one of 
said piston ends spaced from an opposing second chamber 
means for the other of said piston ends; and (d) means for moving said first and second 
chamber means relatively toward said reactionary mass to 
reduce the relative volume of hydraulic fluid in said 
chamber means to enable higher frequency seismic wave 
generation. The invention also provides a method of creating a 
sweep sonic wave, which method comprises the steps of: 
a) positioning a reactionary mass between a pair 
of piston ends located in chambers means spaced from said 
mass to enable said mass to vibrate in movement as said 
piston ends move said mass; b) providing a cyclic flow of hydraulic fluid 
flow to act on said piston ends to initiate and sustain 
vibration of said reactionary mass; c) reducing the vibration range of movement with 
an increase in vibration frequency; and d) wherein the step of
