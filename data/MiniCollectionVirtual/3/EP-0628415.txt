<ABSTRACT>
In an ink jet printing system (10), improved gray scale and color 
resolution is 

achieved without modifying the printing grid resolution by reducing 
the ink droplet 

volume to a level below the unit droplet volume selected to cover a 
nominal printing 

grid location. Multiple passes of the print head are used to print an 
integer multiple 

number of the reduced-volume droplets, thereby forming effective dots 
with greater 

gray scale resolution. Multiple different droplet volumes are provided 
in a printing 

system so as to achieve enhanced resolution without a linear increase 
in the number 

of print passes. Another aspect of the invention is to reduce the ink 
concentration or 

dye load again to improve gray scale resolution without changing the 
printing grid. 

Multiple different dye load concentrations may be provided for further 
enhancements 

in resolution again without a linear increase in the number of print 
passes required. 

Finally, the invention includes printing with a reduced-volume droplet 
of a reduced-dye 

load ink, called a hifi droplet, for still further improvements in 
print quality, 

resulting in printed images approximating those produced by 
continuously variable 

color densities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to methods and apparatus for improved ink jet 
printing and more particularly, this invention relates to controlling the amount of ink 
applied to each pixel in order to achieve dramatic improvements in image quality and 
resolution while minimizing cost and speed penalties. The use of ink jet printing systems has grown dramatically in recent years. 
This may be attributed to substantial improvements in resolution and overall print 
quality coupled with appreciable reductions in cost. Today's ink jet printers offer 
acceptable print quality for many commercial, business and household applications 
at costs fully an order of magnitude lower than comparable products available just a 
few years ago. Notwithstanding their recent success, intensive research and 
development efforts continue toward improving ink jet print quality. In general, print 
quality still falls short of that produced by more expensive technologies such as 
photography and offset or gravure printing. The challenge remains to further 
improve print quality in ink jet printing systems without increasing their cost. Efforts 
toward achieving this goal are limited due to the fundamental fact that the drop on 
demand method and most of the continuous ink jet methods are essentially binary: 
at each picture element (pixel) of the paper (or other output media) they must place 
a droplet of ink or no ink at all. This sharply limits gray scale resolution. Color ink jet printers typically use only three or four colors of ink (magenta, 
yellow, cyan and optionally black). Consequently, only a very limited range of color 
shades can be printed by different combinations of these colors in each pixel. The 
range of colors that can be so formed, i.e. the color resolution, is strictly limited 
because more than two or three drops of ink together form a volume that is  
 
excessive and therefore tends to bleed and mottle the paper. This limitation has 
been circumvented somewhat by the so-called dither techniques, in which the 
picture is divided into a large number of square matrices, each matrix containing a 
certain number of pixels, such as 4x4 or 8x8 pixels. Different shades of color can be 
obtained by filling different numbers of pixels in each matrix with ink. Hence, using a 
4x4 matrix 16 different shades of color and white (no color) can be generated, while 
an 8x8 matrix allows the rendition of 64 shades of color in addition to white. 
Dithering thus reduces the effective spacial resolution for all colors

printing system having a predetermined printing grid (30) defining an array of pixel 

locations (32,34) and having a unit ink droplet volume selected for covering 
approximately one pixel location on a printing medium, a method of printing at a 

selected pixel location comprising: 
   providing a print cartridge (16) having a nozzle for delivering a droplet of
