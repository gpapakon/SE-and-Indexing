<ABSTRACT>
In order to seal leakage points (7) in pipes (8), use is made of a resilient sealing sleeve (1) which - borne by a mounting carriage (2) - is advanced to the leakage point (7). The sealing sleeve (1) is raised up to the top of the pipe (8) by means of a lifting and lowering apparatus (36) and is widened there in the circumferential direction (13) by a widening device (18). For widening purposes, use is made of a widening device provided on the mounting carriage (2). An arresting device on the sealing sleeve (1) retains the latter in its widened position for the purpose of sealing the pipe (8).

Device for sealing leaks in pipes from the pipe interior,
with a sealing collar which can expand in the

circumferential direction at the leak and a mounting car
which can be led up to the leak, wherein the sealing collar

is in the form of an expandable band which is bent together
in the shape of a ring from a resilient material and the two

ends of which overlap in the circumferential direction, the
collar being completely surrounded by a hose of an

elastomeric material and bearing a retaining device which
holds it in the expanded state, and the mounting car

comprises a chassis provided with wheels, characterised in
that the sealing collar (1) comprises at least one expanding

device (18) which can be actuated by the mounting car (2)
and to which the retaining device (19) is connected, and

that the mounting car (2) comprises an actuating device (38)
for the expanding device (18) and has a lifting and lowering

device (36) for the actuating device (38).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
expanding device (18) of the sealing collar (1) is at least

one slit (20) which is disposed at the inner band end (11)
in the circumferential direction (13) and one longitudinal

side (21) of which bears a row of teeth (22), and a pinion
(23) is rotatably mounted at the outer band end (12), which

pinion meshes with the row of teeth (22).
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the
retaining device (19) is a locking bolt (25) which lies in

the slit (20), engages in the pinion (13) and is subject to
the influence of a spring element (27).
Device according to one of claims 2 and 3, characterised
in that the inner band end (11) of the sealing collar (1)

bears a guide groove (28) which is provided in the
circumferential direction (13) and in which a holding-down

mechanism (29) engages, the latter being secured to the 
outer band end (12) and engaging in the guide groove (28).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised

in that the sealing collar (1) bears, on the hose (14), two
circulating sealing bands (15) which consist of a rubberlike

material swelling when coming into contact with water
and which are disposed next to the two circumferential edges

(16) of the sealing collar (1).
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that strips
(17) of copper are laid in the sealing bands (15).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the chassis (30) of the mounting car (2) bears at

least one motor-driven screw driver (39) as actuating device
(38) for the expanding device (18) of the sealing collar

(1), the screw tool (41) of which screw driver comprises at
its head (42) a socket (43) for the pinion (23) of the

expanding device (18).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that the chassis (30) of the mounting car (2) comprises

four wheels (31), two of which are in each case rotatably
secured to a common axle (32).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that, in order to form the lifting and lowering device

(36), each axle (32) is articulated to the chassis (30) by
means of a pivot frame (33), and a cylinder-piston unit (35)

acts on each pivot frame (33).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised
in that the mounting car (2) comprises at least one

mechanical thrust member (44) which is active
perpendicularly to the direction of travel (10) of the

mounting car (2).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised
in that a coupling device (3) is provided on the 

chassis (30) to connect the mounting car (2) to a
remote-controlled drive car (4).
Method for sealing leaks in pipes from the pipe
interior, using a mounting car (2) and a sealing collar (1)

according to one or more of claims 1 to 11, wherein the
mounting car (2), which bears the sealing collar (1), is led

up to a leak (7), at which the sealing collar (1) is
expanded in the circumferential direction (13),

characterised by the following method steps:

the sealing collar (1) is firstly pushed over the mounting
car (2) such that it surrounds the chassis (30) thereof and

leaves its wheels (31) free,
the sealing collar (1) is now positioned on the mounting
car (2),
the sealing collar (1) is then lifted to the apex of the
pipe interior and pressed against it here,
the sealing collar (1) is subsequently expanded until it
lies firmly against the pipe interior all round,
the sealing collar (1) is then held in the expanded state
by the retaining device (19).
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that the
mounting car (2) is finally separated from the sealing

collar (1) by being pushed away by means of mechanical
thrust members (44).
