<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical drive for a storage system used for parking cars has a roller chain (10) with driving blocks (11) that are driven by a driving chain wheel (12) and that drive linking bars (9) interconnected into a conveyor (6); the linking bars (9) move the cels (7) forward and are moved in a running track (20).

Mechanical drive in a storage system (1), which is formed by a steel 
construction bearing a drivable path, and the drivable path is formed by a 

plurality of tiers (5) running over one another, consisting of straight sections 
(20) connected by curved paths (4), and movable along the drivable path are 

cells (7) which are mutually connected by connecting rods (9), which form a 
composite conveyor (6) characterized in that provided in each tier (5) in at least 

one area (3) of the storage system (1), except in the tier foreseen for parking 
(8), are at least two chain wheels, at least one of which is a drive chain wheel 

(12) over which a roller chain (10) runs, which is provided with drive elements 
(11) which engage in recesses (19) of at least one connecting rod (9) of the 

composite conveyor (6) for movement of the cells (7), the profile of the drive 
elements (11) engaging in the recesses (19) and the profile of the recesses 

(19) of the connecting rods (9) being designed in such a way that a rolling 
contact takes place, and in that guides (14) are provided in the area of 

engagement of the drive elements (11) in the recesses (19) of the connecting 
rods (9), which guides are height-adjustable and with which the roller chain 

(10) is supported, in order to keep the drive elements (11) engaged in the 
recesses (19) of the connecting rods (9). 
Mechanical drive according to claim 1, characterized in that accommodated 
in the area (3) are four chain wheels (12, 13, 15), over which a roller 

chain (10) runs, of which at least one is a drive chain wheel (12), the drive 
elements (11) of the roller chain (10) engaging at the same time in the 

recesses (19) of at least two connecting rods (9) of the composite conveyor (6), 
which are located in two tiers (5, 8) lying one over the other. 
Mechanical drive according to claim 2, characterized in that in at least 
one further adjacent tier (5) four chain wheels (12, 13, 15) are accommodated, 

over which a roller chain (10) runs, of which at least one is a drive roller chain 
wheel (12) so that in each case a connecting rod (9) is in active connection 

with roller chains (10) on two opposite sides at the same time.  
 
Mechanical drive according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the 
momentary correct mutual positioning of cells (7) is ensured in each tier (5, 8). 
Mechanical drive according to one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized 
in that the synchronization of the movement of the cells (7) in the individual 

tiers (5, 8) takes place mechanically.
