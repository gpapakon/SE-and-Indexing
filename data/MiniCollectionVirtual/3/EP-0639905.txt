<ABSTRACT>
It comprises of an exchange (1) connected to its associated terminal 
equipments (3) by means of optical fibres (4) and passive distributors (2) 

based on networks of one or two optical fibres and using techniques of time 
compression multiplexing or time division multiplexing, respectively. 
This system transmits a frame structure of fixed length that comprises 
a common channels field for the interchange of control information, an 

information channels field for sending and receiving user information and a 
burst alignment field that is used in the process of aligning bursts coming 

from the associated terminal equipments (3) towards the exchange (1) inside 
the previously allocated time slots.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an optical fibre digital communication system
that uses the technique of time division multiple access, TDMA, and which
comprises an exchange and a set of network terminal equipment connected to
it by means of optical fibre links, either directly or else using passive
distributors in networks of one or two optical fibres. The network terminalequipment is also connected to a number of subscribers by means of wire
cables in order to provide them with communications service.It is of particular application in optical fibre point to multipoint
subscriber distribution systems with flexible allocation of the number of
channels per network terminal equipment
according to service requirements.There are various architectures for optical fibre point to multipoint
subscriber distribution systems based on TDMA protocols.A number of them are used in two-fibre networks and make use of time
division multiplexing TDM, in which the information is transmitted continuously
in the direction from the exchange towards the terminal equipment. Others
are employed in single fibre networks and make use of time compression
multiplexing TCM, using bidirectional transmission on the same fibre.This is illustrated in the publication "System Specification and
Requirements for Fiber in the Loop Systems", by C.A. Eldering and A. Martin
Minguez, PROCEEDINGS OF SPIE OE - FIBERS'92 CONFERENCE, Boston,
MA, September 1992, pages 156-165.In this publication the possibility of using grouped channel or
independent channel frame structures is mentioned. In the structures of the
first type, each terminal equipment, that is providing service for a certain
number of subscribers, groups together the channels that have been allocated
to it by the system in order to form an information field to which it adds a
preamble, while in the structures of the second type, each subscriber channel
forms a single burst consisting of this subscriber's information field plus a
preamble.In figure 3 of the publication mentioned, two frame structures are 
shown; one for the case of time division multiplexing (TDM/TDMA), and one
for the case of time compression multiplexing (TCM/TDMA), the first being for
the case of two-fibre networks and the second for single fibre networks. These
frames comprise an operation and maintenance channel in both transmission
directions for the interchange of control commands between the exchange
and the network terminal equipment and payload channels which are
channels bearing subscriber's information when they are
