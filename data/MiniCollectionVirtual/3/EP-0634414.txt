<ABSTRACT>
A Southwest Indian Ocean marine sponge 
Spirastrella 
spinispirulifera
 (bright colored reds and purples) 
has been found to contain new and exceptionally 

active cell (human cancer) growth inhibitors 
spongistatin 5, spongistatin 7, spongistatin 8 and 

spongistatin 9. These compositions are related to 
spongistatin 1, which was found in a black 
Spongia sp.
 
in the Porifera family. A method of treating 

human cancer cells with spongistatin 5 and 
spongistatin 7 is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the discovery and
isolation of compounds extracted from the marine
sponge Spirastrella spinispirulifera (Class
Demospongiae, Order Hadromerida, Family Spirastrellidae).
These new macrocyclic lactones are
designated herein as "spongistatin 5", "spongistatin
7", "spongistatin 8" and "spongistatin 9".
Spongistatin 5 and spongistatin 7 were found to be
remarkably potent and specific against the human
cancer cell lines in the U.S. National Cancer
Institute's panel.A great number of ancient marine invertebrate species
in the Phyla Bryozoa, Mollusca and Porifera were well
established in the earth's oceans over one billion
years ago. Certainly such organisms have explored
trillions of biosynthetic reactions in their
evolutionary chemistry to reach present levels of
cellular organization, regulation and defense.
Marine sponges have changed minimally in physical
appearance for nearly 500 million years, suggesting
a very effective chemical evolution in response to
changing environmental conditions for at least that
time period. Some recognition of the potential for
utilizing biologically potent marine animal
constituents was recorded in Egypt about 2,700 BC,
and by 200 BC sea hare extracts were being used in
Greece for medicinal purposes. Such considerations,
combined with the general observation that marine
organisms (especially invertebrates and sharks)
rarely develop cancer, led to the first systematic 
investigation of marine animal and plant anticancer
constituents.By 1968 ample evidence had been obtained, based on
the U. S. National Cancer Institute's key
experimental cancer systems, that certain marine
organisms would provide new and structurally novel
antineoplastic and/or cytotoxic agents. Analogous
considerations suggested that marine organisms could
also provide effective new drugs for other severe
medical challenges, such as viral diseases.
Furthermore, marine organisms were expected to
contain potentially useful drug candidates (and
biochemical probes) of unprecedented structural
types, that would have eluded discovery by
contemporary techniques of medicinal chemistry.
Fortunately, some of these expectations have been
realized in the intervening period. Illustrative of
these successes are the discoveries of the
bryostatins, dolastatins, and cephalostatins by the
Cancer Research Institute in Tempe, Arizona where
several members of these series of remarkable
anticancer drug candidates are either now in human
clinical trial or preclinical development. See: e.g.
