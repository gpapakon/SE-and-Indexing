<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for cascading three sigma-delta 
modulators involves applying an error signal representing 

the quantization error of a preceding modulator to a 
subsequent modulator. The error signal is scaled by a 

factor before being applied to a subsequent modulator. 
The quantized error signal of the subsequent modulator is 

then scaled by the reciprocal of the original scaling 
factor before being combined with the quantized outputs 

of the previous modulators. Combining the quantized 
outputs of the three modulators is performed so as to 

cancel the quantization error of the previous stages 
while shaping the noise at the last stage so that most of 

the noise is placed at high frequencies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to sigma-delta 
modulators. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to methods of cascading sigma-delta 
modulators. Oversampled interpolative (or sigma-delta) 
modulators comprise at least one integration stage or 
filter followed by a quantization stage (most typically 
a comparator) and a feedback from the output of the 
quantization stage to the input of the integration stage. 
Depending upon the number of integration stages, sigma-delta 
modulators can be divided into order types, e. g., 
second-order, third-order, or fourth-order. Sigma-delta modulators have come to be commonly used 
to perform analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog  
 
(D/A) conversion in a number of applications. These 
applications include coder-decoders (codecs), integrated 
services digital network (ISDN) equipment, and audio 
equipment. The use of higher order sigma-delta modulators has 
become desirable in many applications for several 
reasons. One reason is because the introduction of 
higher order modulators increases the number of 
integrations to be carried out, which results in a 
decrease in the noise level of the passband as the 
quantization noise is shifted to a higher frequency 
level. Another reason is because the use of higher order 
modulators keeps the oversampling ratio (i. e. , the ratio 
of the modulator clock to the Nyquist rate) low, which is 
desirable under certain conditions. A number of efforts have heretofore been undertaken 
to develop higher order sigma-delta modulators. Four 
such efforts, those undertaken by Matsuya et al., Ribner, 
Chao et al. and Karema et al., are discussed immediately 
below. Matsuya, et al. , in " A 16-Bit Oversampling A-D 
Conversion Technology Using Triple-Integration Noise 
Shaping", IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. 
SC-22, No. 6, pp. 921-929, Dec. 1987, have presented a 
method of cascading three or more first-order modulators 
in order to provide higher order noise shaping. A block 
diagram of this circuit is shown in FIG. 1. The 
technique employed in this circuit, well known to those 
skilled in the art as the "MASH" technique, is described 
at length in U.S. Patent 5, 061, 928 to Karema. That 
discussion is hereby incorporated herein by this 
reference thereto. Although the circuit in FIG. 1 could 
be discussed at length, given the level of skill of those  
 
skilled in the art, it suffices here to say that the 
circuit of FIG. 1 depicts three cascaded first-order 
modulators (each generally
