<ABSTRACT>
The high-efficiency steam power plant proposed uses as its working fluid a mixture of two liquids with different boiling points. The working fluid is heated in a pressure vessel (1) and passed in a closed circuit through an expansion chamber (4) and a condenser (6) to the pressure vessel (1) again. In the expansion chamber (4), the liquid with the lower boiling point evaporates, while the liquid with the higher boiling point forms droplets. In another closed circuit running in the opposite direction, a coolant is liquefied by a heat pump and cooled in a heat exchanger (10) in order to cool the condenser (6) following expansion. After the condenser (6), the working fluid passes through the heat exchanger (10) where it is heated.

<CLAIMS>
A steam power plant wherein the heated liquid working 
medium is fed to an expander machine (4), the working medium 

consisting of a mixture of at least two substances having 
different boiling points at the same pressure, characterized 

in that the working medium is fed as a mixture of the at 
least two substances to a pressure tank (1) in a closed circuit 

via a condenser (6), and a closed, opposed coolant circuit 
is provided, the condenser (6) being cooled with the expanded 

cooled gaseous coolant in the circuit of the working 
medium. 
The steam power plant of claim 1, characterized in 
that a throttle valve (3) precedes the expander machine (4) 

for reducing the pressure of the liquid working medium with 
evaporation of the substance with the low boiling point and 

formation of droplets in the substance with the higher boiling 
point. 
The steam power plant of claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the working medium liquefied in the condenser (6) is 

heated via the heat exchanger (10) in the coolant circuit and 
fed to the pressure tank (1).
