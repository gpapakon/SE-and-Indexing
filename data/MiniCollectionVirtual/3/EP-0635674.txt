<ABSTRACT>
A signalling lamp for a motor vehicle comprises a light source, an outer cover lens, a transluscent intermediate shield (20), placed between the light source and the cover lens and having on its outer surface opaque regions (21) which define light-passage windows (22), and first optical elements (23) formed on the inner side of the intermediate shield for causing the light coming from the source and the flux recoverer to converge towards the said windows while giving it a spread in a first direction. According to the invention, the intermediate shield comprises, on the outer side, at the level of at least a portion of the light-passage windows (22), second optical elements (24) which spread the light in a second direction which is generally perpendicular to the first.

Indicator light for a motor vehicle, of the type 
comprising a light source (10, 11), an external glass (40), a 

flux recuperator, a translucent intermediate screen (20), 
positioned between the light source and the glass, which has 

on its external surface opaque areas (21) which define windows 
(22) for the passage of the light, and first optical elements 

(23) formed on the inside of the intermediate screen in order 
to cause the light coming from the source and from the flux 

recuperator to converge on the said windows, dispersing it in 
a first direction, the intermediate screen having, on the 

outside, level with at least one part of the windows (22) for 
the passage of the light, second optical elements (24), 

characterised in that the second optical elements disperse the 
light in a second direction, generally perpendicular to the 

first. 
Light according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
windows (22) are in the shape of rectilinear strips and in 

that the second optical elements (24) comprise level with each 
window a succession of cylindrical optical elements with a 

generator generally perpendicular to the direction of the said 
strips. 
Light according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
said second optical elements (24) comprise single prisms. 
Light according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the said second optical elements (24) comprise double 

prisms. 
Light according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the said second optical elements (24) comprise 

cylindrical lenses.  
 
Light according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the optical elements are formed in grooves (25) provided 

in the intermediate screen level with each window. 
Light according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the glass (40) is smooth or slightly diffusing.
