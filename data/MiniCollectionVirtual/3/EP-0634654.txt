<ABSTRACT>
In a device for monitoring the quality of purified water, 
particularly for biological purification plants, 

an optical probe (2) comprises two optical fibres (3,4) 
connected in a single terminal (14). A reflector (15) placed in front of 

terminal (14) reflects light from (3) to the second fibre (4). Fibres 
(3,4), terminal (14), and reflector (15) are mounted on a rigid 

stainless steel support (19) and the probe (2) is placed in chamber (16) 
with water inlet (17) and outlet (18) connected to the plant. The 

photocell (5) measures the difference between the emitted and received 
light signals, which difference is proportional to the turbidity of the 

water. The output from (5) is supplied to computer (7) via 
analogue-digital converter (6). The computer also has RAM (9) and 

wave-shaping circuit (10) together with display means (11), and is 
connected to external computer (13). Turbidity values are correlated 

using regression analysis to probabilities that the concentrations of 
noxious components satisfy legal requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
monitoring the quality of purified water, particularly for
biological purification plants.As is known, monitoring of activated-sludge municipal
purification plants is performed by measuring the
functional parameters of the individual compartments of the
plant and of the machines.This measurement is performed by:
-- measuring functional data: PH, temperature,
conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pump operation hours
(therefore approximately 95% of the daily flow rates),
aeration hours, volume of sludge in 11/30' cone (VF);-- retrieving sludge samples: under aeration for
microscopic investigations and dry content measurement
(ssa); under recirculation for dry content measurement
(ssr).Measured and calculated parameters provide additional
data, such as the Mohlam index (Im), recirculation ratio,
sludge load (with input analyses), and settling solid load.Occasional retrieval of samples at the input and at
the output furthermore allows to determine the input load,
its biodegradability, purification efficiencies, and most
of all whether the output parameters comply with the
applicable statutory provisions.In normal municipal purification plants (and generally
in biological activated-sludge plants), chemical analyses
are performed only occasionally: in the best of cases, 
every week, usually every month or two if not more.In order to obtain a more frequent indication between
successive analyses of the quality of the purified water
and to make the related parameters fall within the limits
prescribed by the applicable statutory provisions, water
monitoring is performed by considering that if the plant is
running correctly, the output water is clear and quite
probably the parameters are within the limits set by the
law.In terms of plant organization, the indication is
obtained by measuring the "clarity" of the water and by
creating a scale graduated from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates
highly polluted water and 10 indicates very clear water
with parameters within the limits of the law.Known devices used to monitor sludge-based
purification plants currently measure only the value of the
clarity of the output water and are unable to give
indications as to the presence of individual substances in
the water. Furthermore, known devices require the retrieval
of a sample of the output water, which is introduced in the
clarity-measuring device.In this manner it is not possible to monitor the
output water continuously and without the aid of an
operator.Known devices furthermore do not
