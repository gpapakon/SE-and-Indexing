<ABSTRACT>
Wheel balancing machine having a main shaft which is mounted in an unbalance measuring arrangement arranged in a machine housing, and one shaft end (1) of which projects out of the machine housing (2), on which shaft end a motor vehicle wheel (4) can be fastened by means of a clamping device (3), and a lighting device (5) which emits light, at least in the direction perpendicular to the shaft end (1) projecting out of the machine housing (2), into such an angular region (illumination region 10), that a part of a wheel-rim dish of the motor vehicle wheel to be clamped on lying over the shaft end (1) is illuminated.

<CLAIMS>
A wheel balancing machine having a main shaft which is mounted 
in an unbalance measuring arrangement disposed in a machine housing (2) 

and of which there projects out of the machine housing a shaft end (1) to 
which a motor vehicle wheel (4) can be fixed by means of a clamping 

device, and a lighting device which emits light into an illumination 
region (10) at least in a direction perpendicularly over the shaft end 

(1) which projects out of the machine housing (2),
 
   characterised in that
 
   the illumination region (10) is a part, which is disposed at the 

inside over the shaft end (1), of a wheel rim dish of the motor vehicle 
wheel (4) which can be clamped to the shaft end (1), and that the light 

is screened off from the space above the illumination region (10). 
A wheel balancing machine according to claim 1 characterised in 
that there is provided an on-off switch (8) for switching the lighting 

device (5) on and off in dependence on a respective operating procedure. 
A wheel balancing machine according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the lighting device (5) has a reflector (8) which 

directs the light emitted by an incandescent lamp (9) into the 
illumination region (10).
