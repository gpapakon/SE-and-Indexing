<ABSTRACT>
Novel copolymers of ethylene with propylene and optionally with 
minor proportions of a diene or polyene having good elastomeric 

properties in their uncured state.
 

The copolymers are characterised by a structure in which the 
propylene is partially present in the form of short isotactic 

sequences. Tension set values ( 200% ) of less than 15 are 
obtained by when the ethylene/propylene ratio has specific values 

and the intrinsic viscosity values are higher than 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to copolymers of
ethylene with propylene and optionally with minor proportions of
a diene or polyene having good elastomeric properties in their
uncured state.The EP and EPDM rubbers, elastomeric copolymers of ethylene
with propylene and minor proportions of a diene or polyene
respectively, are well known products in the state of the art.These copolymers are generally prepared by polymerising a
mixture of ethylene and propylene and optionally diene or polyene
with Ziegler-Natta catalysts obtained from vanadium compounds,
such as acetylacetonate, and alkyl aluminium halides.The copolymers so obtained necessitate a vulcanisation
treatment (with peroxide or sulphur) in order to acquire
elastomeric behaviour of interest in industrial applications. In
the their uncured state they are not endowed with elastomeric
properties of interest.Thermoplastic polyolefin rubbers (TPO) are known, which are
capable of maintaining the processability characteristics of the
thermoplastic polymers and at the same time are endowed with an
elastomeric behaviour. These rubbers are obtained by high
temperatures dynamic vulcanisation of blends of the crystalline
polymer, in particular isotactic polypropylene, with EP or EPDM
rubbers in the presence of crosslinking agents.Copolymers endowed with a certain level of elasto-plastic
properties are known, obtained by polymerisation of mixtures of
propylene with minor proportions of ethylene using a catalyst 
based on a titanium compound supported on magnesium dichloride
(USP 4,298,721). These copolymers are characterised by a high
crystallinity content of polypropylenic type, and optionally of
polyethylenic type; the elastomeric properties of these
copolymers are unsatisfactory (200% tension set values are too
high).Preparing elastomeric copolymers of ethylene with propylene
and/or with α-olefins and optionally with minor proportion of a
diene or polyene by means of the polymerization of mixtures of
monomers with homogeneous catalysts obtained from Ti, Zr or Hf
metallocenes and alumoxane compounds, is known.European Patent Application EP-A-347128 describes a process
for the preparation of elastomeric copolymers of ethylene with
α-olefins in which the catalyst used is the product obtained from
the reaction of bridged dicyclopentadienyl -Zr, -Ti or Hf
compounds, such as ethylene-bis(indenyl)-zirconium dichloride or
ethylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl)-zirconium dichloride or dimethylsilanylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl)-zirconium
dichloride, with
polymethyl-alumoxane.T
