<ABSTRACT>
An antianemic composition for veterinary use which 
comprises a complex of a dextran carboxylic acid obtained by 

a microbial process and an iron salt, and a veterinary 
acceptable carrier is disclosed. The composition can contain 

a high concentration of iron and have a low viscosity and 
particularly useful for preventing or treating anemia of 

piglets caused by iron deficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antianemic 
composition for veterinary use (hereinafter referred to as an 
antianemic veterinary composition). More specifically, it 
relates to a veterinary composition for supplying animals with 
iron to prevent or treat anemia of the animals. In particular, 
the composition of the present invention is useful for 
preventing or treating anemia of piglets caused by iron 
deficiency. It is well known that piglets are liable to anemia 
caused by iron deficiency within a short period of time after 
their birth because of their little iron storage due to their 
small birth weights, and insufficient iron supply due to their 
quick growth and low iron content of their sow's milk. In 
particular, recently, as rearing of pigs in a closed pen 
system has become popular, iron ingestion from the earth has 
become difficult and the frequency of occurrence of anemia 
caused by iron deficiency in piglets, in particular, suckling 
pigs is increased.  Hitherto, ferrous fumarate, dextran iron and the 
like have been administered to exert antianemic activity on 
these animals. Dextran is a general name of high molecular weight 
glucans mainly composed of α 1→6 bonds and produced from 
sucrose by a lactobacillus, Leuconostocmesenteroides. 
Dextran-iron which is produced from dextran and iron hydroxide 
has been used as a prophylactically or therapeutically 
effective product for supplying animals, in particular, 
piglets with iron by parenteral administration such as 
intramuscular injection to improve anemic disease conditions 
caused by iron deficiency. Especially, a dextran-iron preparation comprising 
a complex of dextran and ferric hydroxide as well as a 
preparation comprising a complex of ferric hydroxide and 
dextran heptonic acid which is obtained from dextran by a 
chemical reaction for increasing its carbon atom have been 
utilized as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for anemia of 
pigs caused by iron deficiency. On the other hand, although various chemical 
modifications of dextran have been attempted, it is very 
difficult to obtain products regio-selectively in high yields 
by generally adopted chemical reactions and many by-products 
are formed. That is, since dextran and many other 
polysaccharides are composed of various high molecular weight  
 
congeners having different molecular weights, in chemical 
modification, various side reactions take place, which results 
in the formation of complicated products and, in many cases, 
difficulties arise in identification of
