<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide an image display method and 
apparatus capable of displaying images corresponding to 

document data or speech data, image data (such as sign 
language images) are stored in an image dictionary in motion 

picture form. Document data is read out from a character 
information storage device (or speech data is received), and 

a sign language image corresponding to a character string of 
the document data (or the speech) is selected from the image 

dictionary and displayed on a display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image display
method and apparatus for displaying images (e.g. motion
pictures) corresponding to voice data or document data, and
more particularly, to an image display method and apparatus
capable of displaying sign language images corresponding to
speech.The addition of voice data (such as a voice, music and
the like) to video images has been long performed, and an
apparatus which not only reproduces video images but
generates sounds related to the images is well known.However, there has been provided no apparatus which
generates and displays images corresponding to input
document data, voice signals and the like. For example, the
contents of a television program are, as is well known,
given to deaf persons by superimposing a caption on the
screen or displaying the contents of speech in sign language 
on a part of the screen. However, since such caption and
sign language displays incur much trouble and cost in
editing, they are, as matters now stand, difficult to
carry out.Furthermore, the provision of information in
characters, such as a caption, requires the deaf persons
to make efforts toward understanding the information and
to concentrate their attention on reading the characters."Deaf-and-Mute Sign Language Generation System", an
article by Hideo Kawai and Shinichi Tamura published at
pages 199-205 of Vol 18 of Pattern Recognition, describes
an apparatus for converting speech/text data into sign
language image data for display on a screen.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an image display method and apparatus capable of
displaying images corresponding to document data or voice
data.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided an apparatus for converting
text data into sign language image data, comprising:
image storage means storing a plurality of image
data components, each image data component corresponding
to a sign language image component for a respective
different one of a plurality of character codes;character code correspondence storage means storing
for each of the said plurality of character codes the
respective address of the corresponding image data
component in the image storage means; means for inputting text data comprising a sequence
of character codes;text storage means for storing the input text data;means for sequentially retrieving from the image
storage means with reference to the addresses in the
character code correspondence storage means image data
components corresponding to the sequence of
