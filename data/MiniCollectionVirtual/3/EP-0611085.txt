<ABSTRACT>
The bore selector includes a housing with an upper end having at least a first bore and 
a lower end with at least second and third bores. The housing includes a central bore extending 

between the upper and lower ends. A tube has its upper end connected to the first bore and its 
lower end adjacent the second and third bores. A yoke having an aperture therethrough for 

passing the tube, is reciprocably mounted within the bore of the housing. The yoke includes 
cam slots receiving guide lugs projecting from the sides of the tube. A hydraulic actuating 

means is also mounted in the lower end of the housing for reciprocating the yoke whereby as 
the yoke is reciprocated within the housing, the guide lugs move within the cam slots to shift 

the lower end of the tube between the second and third bores. A cage is mounted within the 
lower end of the housing to ensure alignment and sealing engagement between the lower end of 

the tube and the face of the housing around the second and third bores.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to subsea wells having multiple tubing strings or
bores extending into the bore hole from a wellhead and with a riser extending to the water
surface, and more particularly, to a bore selector disposed between the riser and wellhead for
providing selective access between the riser and one of the individual bores.Subsea wells with multiple bores have one or more tubing or production strings
suspended from a wellhead. A riser extends from the wellhead to a platform at the surface.
Oftentimes it is necessary to have access to individual bores for extending a wire line tool from
the surface into one of the bores. The riser includes multiple strings of riser pipe extending to
the surface typically with individual riser strings for each bore. However, individual riser
strings are very expensive. Many times these risers must be specially built to allow access to
each of the individual bores.A dual bore selector selects either the bore for production or the bore to the annulus in
a dual bore completion. The dual bore selector is either connected above a tubing hanger
running tool or is tied back into the christmas tree, depending on whether you are performing
a workover. A specialty riser is constructed which includes two casing strings side by side to
tie back and communicate with the dual bores. The riser is used to perform the initial
completion and the workover. Such specialty risers are quite expensive and specialty risers in
45 foot sections for deep water may cost millions of dollars just for the risers. Thus, it is
preferred to only have one riser string extending to the surface thereby eliminating the other
string to reduce cost. U. S. -A- 4,770,247 discloses a multiple bore well having a riser with a bore selector.
The selector is connected at its lower end to a subsea wellhead supporting multiple tubing strings
for completion and workover operations. The selector is connected at its upper end to the lowest
section of the riser string extending to the surface. The selector includes an upper tubular
member having a single bore in flow communication with the riser string, a lower member
having multiple bores which align with the multiple bores of the subsea wellhead, and an
intermediate section having a rotary portion which communicates with the single upper bore and
selectively communicates with each of the individual lower multiple bores as the intermediate
section is rotated.Various prior art patents disclose flowline switches or selectors. U.S. -A- 4,133,418;

<CLAIMS>
A bore selector comprising: a housing (30) having a
first end with at least a first bore (12) and a second end

(174) with at least second (16) and third (18) bores, the
housing having a central bore (32) extending between the

first and second ends; a conduit member (40) having a flow
bore therethrough with a first terminus connected to the

first end communicating the flow bore with the first bore
and a second terminus adjacent to the second end for

communicating the flow bore with one of the second or third
bores; a yoke (50) having an aperture therethrough for

receiving the second terminus, the yoke being reciprocally
mounted within the central bore adjacent to the second end;

a guide (112,190) disposed on the yoke and the conduit
member for shifting the second terminus between a first

position where the flow bore communicates with the second
bore and a second position where the flow bore communicates

with the third bore; and means (60) for reciprocating the
yoke to cause the guide to shift the conduit member between

the first and second positions; characterised by guide
wings (120) on the conduit (40) adjacent to the second

terminus which are guided by guide surfaces (133,135)
within the housing (30) so as to maintain the end of the

second terminus parallel to the second end (174); and by a
floating seal member (130) which ensures continuous sealing

engagement between the second terminus and the second end
(174).
A bore selector according to claim 1, wherein the
guide includes a key (112) mounted on the conduit member

(40), the key being disposed within a cam slot (190) in the
yoke (50).
A bore selector according to claim 2, wherein the cam
slot (190) forms 45 degree cam surfaces on the yoke (50)

for engaging 45 degree bearing surfaces on the key (112). 
A bore selector according to claim 2 or claim 3,
wherein the cam slot (190) includes detentes for locking

the key (112) in the first and second positions.
A bore selector according to any one of the preceding
claims, further including first and second cages (70,72)

disposed within the housing (30) the cages including
bearing surfaces which engage the guide wings (120).
A bore selector according to claim 1, wherein the seal
member (130) includes inner (278) and outer (279) seal

grooves housing inner (280) and outer (282) metal seal
rings respectively.
A bore selector according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the seal member (130) includes differential

pressure areas (262,276) allowing internal and external
pressures to move the seal member into sealing engagement

with the second end (174).
A bore selector according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the seal member includes sealing means

(280,282) for sealingly engaging the second end and biasing
means (290) for biasing the sealing means against the

second end (174).
A bore selector according to claim 8, wherein the
biasing means includes a plurality of belleville spring

washers (270).
A bore selector according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the yoke includes upper (184) and lower

(185) apertures for the passage of the conduit member (40)
therethrough and for allowing the conduit member to shift
