<ABSTRACT>
A launching tube (1) for a launching device for a rocket (2), in which launching tube a rocket can be accommodated, is made from a composite material. The inside of the launching tube is lined with a protective layer which provides protection against the high temperatures and the substances or gases which are released when a rocket is launched from the launching tube. The protective layer may comprise phenolic glass, phenolic carbon and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a launching tube for a launching device for a
rocket, in which launching tube a rocket can be accommodated, which launching
tube is made from a composite material.Launching tubes and launching devices of this nature are known from disclosures such as for example FR-A-2 431 673 and EP-A-0 505 927. An
example which may be mentioned is a launching device comprising a canister in
which a launching tube made from a composite material is accommodated. A
canister in which four launching tubes can be accommodated is also known.The launching tube forms a protection for the rocket, so that it is not
damaged, rendering it unusable, during transport, for example. The launching tube
also forms a protection for the surrounding structure of the launching device when
the rocket is launched. During the launch, hot gases are released, which could
damage the launching device. The launching tube guides the gases which are
released to an opening from which they are discharged.The known launching tubes can only be used once. After the rocket has
been launched, they are of no further use.The object of the invention is to provide a launching tube which is
suitable for reuse. This object is achieved in that the inside of the launching tube is
lined with a protective layer which provides protection against the high
temperatures and the substances or gases which are released when a rocket is
launched from the launching tubes.In particular, the protective layer may comprise a phenolic glass,
phenolic carbon, etc. The phenolic glass, etc forms a sacrificial layer which
provides the possibility of using the launching tube a number of times to launch a
rocket.To save weight, the launching tube may comprise a wound fibre
material which is impregnated with a resin.During the launch of the rocket, relatively high pressures arise in the
interior of the launching tube owing to the gases which are released. In order to be
able to withstand these relatively high pressures, even with a small wall thickness,
the cross section of the launching tube is rounded. In particular, the launching tube may have two slightly curved walls,
which walls, via rounded sections, adjoin a further slightly curved wall. However,
completely planar walls are not ruled out. The advantage of this embodiment is
that a plurality of launching tubes can be accommodated in a compact space next
to one another, and slightly curved or planar walls limit the space required.In this connection, the walls may adjoin an outwardly arched wall
which is
