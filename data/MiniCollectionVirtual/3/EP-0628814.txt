<ABSTRACT>
Indicator system for checking air removal and/or monitoring sterilisation of full loads in steam sterilisers. The indictor (1-) consists of a base body (11) having an end tube (3-), with a reception slot (24) arranged therein for insertion of a chemical indicator (25). The free end of the base body is releasably closed using a cap (17). Indicators found hitherto on the market display false interpretations of the chemical indicator in the case of relatively long sterilisation time, since heat transmission is fed via the walls of the indicator in the case of relatively long sterilisation times. The indicator described minimises the heating of the chemical indicator through the indicator wall, on the one hand by using materials with high heat capacity for the base body (11) and the screw cap (17) and by the base body being surrounded on all sides by a cover of insulating material (20).
