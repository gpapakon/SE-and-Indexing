<DESCRIPTION>
 1-PIPERAZINEACETIC DERIVATIVES AS FIBRINOGEN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTSThis invention relates to acetic acid derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to their use in medicine.It is widely accepted that the glycoprotein complex Gp llb/llla is the fibrinogen binding site on platelets that mediates the adhesive function required for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. We have now found a group of non-peptidic compounds which inhibit fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation by blocking the binding of fibrinogen to the putative fibrinogen receptor Gp llb/llla complex.The invention thus provides the compounds of general formula (I)
 and salts, solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, in whichX1 and X2 represent CH or are different and represent CH or N;Y\ Y2, Y3 and Y4 represent CH, or Y1 and Y4 represent CH and Y2 and Y3 represent N, or Y2 and Y3 represent CH and Y1 and Y4 represent N, or three of Y1 to Y4 represent CH and the other represents N;Z1 represents CH or N;Z2 represents N or N+R6;R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl, C-).4alkyl or 2,2,2- trifluoroethyl group;R2 represents a hydrogen atom or, when both X1 and X2 represent CH, may also represent a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a C1_4alkyi group;SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 R3 represents a hydrogen atom or, when both Y1 and Y2 represent CH, may also represent a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a C^alkyl group;R4 and R5 each represent a hydrogen atom; or, when Z1 represents CH and Z2 represents N, R4 may also represent C^alkyl; or, when both Z1 and Z2 both represent N, R4 and R5 may be the same or different, and represent hydrogen or C .4alkyl;R6 represents a C^alkyl group or phenylC^alkyl group;R7 represents a hydrogen atom; a C1. alkyl group; a naphthyl group; a thiophene group; an unsubstituted phenyl group; a phenyl group substituted by Pι_4alkyl group, C1.4alkoxy, phenylC^alkoxy, OH, halogen (where halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine), CF3, unsubstituted phenyl, phenyl substituted by OH, pyridinyl, NR8R9, NHS02R8, CONR8R9 or C02R8; a C^alkyl group substituted by one or more naphthyl, phenyl, OH or C02R8; a C2.4alkenyl group substituted by one or more naphthyl, phenyf, OH or C02R8; or a saturated or unsaturated C5.7cycloalkyl group; andR8 and R9, which may be the same or different represent H or C-,. alkyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a saturated 5 to 7 membered ring.In the formulae that
