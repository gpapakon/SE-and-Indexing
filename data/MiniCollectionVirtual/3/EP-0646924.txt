<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monolithically integratable
voltage booster circuits, and particularly to a circuit
effective to generate both positive and negative boosted
voltages for driving circuit nodes in circuits adapted for
monolithic integration in CMOS technology.A specific application of the invention is related to
devices which include non-volatile storage cells.With conventional non-volatile memories, a known cell write
technique is that of applying, to the cell drain terminal,
a voltage having a moderately high value (e.g., 6.5 Volts),
while a higher voltage value (e.g., 10.5 Volts) is applied
to its gate.To erase a cell, on the other hand, a high voltage (e.g.,
10.5 Volts) is applied to the source terminal of the cell,
while its gate terminal is held at ground potential.Such erasing is usually carried out simultaneously on all
the cells of a device or all the cells in a memory block
("erasing by sectors").All the high-voltage references needed for proper operation
of a memory are conveniently generated, moreover, within
the device from the standard external supply voltage (5
Volts). It should not be overlooked, however, that during
the erasing phase, a current is flowed between the cell
sources and the substrate; while this is quite small (equal
to 1 µA) for an individual cell, the overall current would
be fairly high in the instance of a large storage capacity
device, making it difficult to provide a voltage booster
within the integrated circuit which can drive the source
electrodes during that operation phase. Furthermore, the
application of a high reverse bias between the cell sources 
and the substrate may introduce reliability problems in
that voltages close to the junction breakdown voltage may
be reached and hot holes generated which become trapped
within the gate oxide.It is for the above-outlined reasons that an alternative
memory erasing technique has been developed whereby the
source electrodes of the cells are held at a relatively low
positive voltage (e.g., 5 Volts), while the gate electrodes
are applied a negative voltage of adequate value
(approximately -10.5 Volts). The circuit which generates
this voltage is not required to supply a large current, so
that it can be provided internally of the integrated
storage circuit.Thus, in more recently developed storage cell devices --such
as "flash" devices -- implemented with field-effect
transistors, the gate terminal of each storage cell is
applied a high positive or negative voltage at the
programming stage, depending respectively on
