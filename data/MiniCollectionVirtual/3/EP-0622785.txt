<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic
recording media, and more particularly to magnetic
recording media whose magnetic layers contain a
nonhalogenated vinyl copolymer with pendant nitrile
groups, pendant hydroxyl groups, and a pendant dispersing
group. The present invention also relates to such a
vinyl copolymer itself.Magnetic recording media generally comprise a
magnetic layer coated onto at least one side of a
nonmagnetizable substrate. For particulate magnetic
recording media, the magnetic layer comprises a magnetic
pigment dispersed in a polymeric binder. The magnetic
layer may also include other components such as
lubricants, abrasives, thermal stabilizers, catalysts,
crosslinkers, antioxidants, dispersants, wetting agents,
fungicides, bactericides, surfactants, antistatic agents,
nonmagnetic pigments, coating aids, and the like.Some forms of magnetic recording media, such as
magnetic recording tape, may also have a backside coating
applied to the other side of the nonmagnetizable
substrate in order to improve the durability,
conductivity, and tracking characteristics of the media.
The backside coating also includes a polymeric binder and
other components such as lubricants, abrasives, thermal
stabilizers, catalysts, crosslinkers, antioxidants,
dispersants, wetting agents, fungicides, bactericides, 
surfactants, antistatic agents, nonmagnetic pigments,
coating aids, and the like.The polymeric binders of the magnetic layer and
the backside coating are commonly derived from polymers
which require curing in order to provide magnetic
recording media with appropriate physical and electromagnetic
properties. To prepare such media, the
components of the magnetic layer or the backside coating,
as appropriate, are combined with a suitable solvent and
thoroughly mixed to form a homogeneous dispersion. The
resulting dispersion is then coated onto the
nonmagnetizable substrate, after which the coating is
dried, calendered if desired, and then cured.The polymeric binders of magnetic recording
media are most commonly prepared from polymer blends
comprising a hard component, i.e., a polymer with
relatively high glass transition temperature and modulus,
and a soft component, i.e. a polymer with relatively low
glass transition temperature and modulus. In the past,
polyurethane polymers have been widely used as the soft
component.Copolymers based on vinyl chloride or
vinylidene chloride have been widely used as the hard
component of choice for use with polyurethanes, due to
their miscibility and compatibility
