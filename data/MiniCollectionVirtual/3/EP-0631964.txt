<ABSTRACT>
A spool (10) for filamentary material such as 
optical fibers and others consists of two members (20, 

22) which are locked together to form a drum with two 
opposed flanges (14, 16) defining a winding space. The 

two members (20, 22) may be separated to allow material 
wound on the drum to be removed at will. After the 

material is removed, the two parts may be locked again 
making the spool reusable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a spool for holding
wires, cables or optical fibers, and more specifically to
a spool which can be separated at will into two parts.Filamentary materials such as wires, cables, optical
fibers, are kept for ease of handling on a spool
consisting of a tubular drum having two opposed ends and
two flanges affixed to said barrel at the respective ends
and extending radially outwardly therefrom. One end of
the elongated material is secured on the drum and the
elongated material is then wound thereon. Once the spool
has been transported to the cabling site, the material is
paid off from the spool until a preselected length has
been reached.A problem with existing spools relates to the manner
in which remainders are removed. The elongated material
is provided in various lengths which normally exceed the
amount of material actually required. For example, while
a spool may hold 110km of optical fiber, of which only a
100km of optical fiber may be actually required. After a
desired amount of material, for example about 100km, is
removed from the spool the remainder (i.e. about 10km) is
usually too short for most applications and must be
discarded. However, this remainder must still be removed
from the spool if the spool is to be reused. In prior
art spools, the remainders could be removed by paying it
off the spool, a very time consuming operation.
Moreover, this was also unsatisfactory because it may
require equipment which may be used more efficiently
elsewhere, and results in a length of unwound material
which is difficult to handle. More frequently the
remainder was simply cut off, however it was almost
impossible to cut each strand or coil without damaging 
the barrel, especially if a relatively thin material is
involved, such as an optical fiber.US-A-4 387 863 discloses a two-piece spool formed by
intermeshing two identical semi-circular segments and
provided with an outer channel defined by flanges for
holding a cable connector.FR-A-2 204 188 discloses a spool constructed in
accordance with the preamble of claim 1. The spool is
held together by integral bayonet means.An objective of the present invention is to provide
a spool for winding filamentary material, wherein said
spool is separable into two pieces to permit the removal
of remainders from the spool.Another objective is to provide a spool made of two
pieces, said pieces being identical for ease of
replacement.A further objective is to provide a spool which may
be made by a single cavity injection molding.Other objectives

<CLAIMS>
A spool (310) comprising a first member
(312) and a second member (314), each of said members

comprising a cylindrical wall (332,332'), an inner end
wall (334,336') provided with an edge (346,346'), and an

outer flange (324,324'), and interlocking means (320,322)
provided on said inner end walls (334,336') for selectively

interlocking said members to define a winding
space for holding filamentary material, said interlocking

means (320,322) being capable of being selectively
released to disengage said members (312,314) and allow at

least a portion of said material to be removed therefrom,

   characterized in that said interlocking means
(320,322) are removable plugs (320,322), each provided

with a camming surface (386) arranged, when each plug
(320, 322) is turned, to bear against said edge

(346,346') for urging said members (312,314) towards each
other.
A spool as claimed in claim 1, wherein each
plug (320,322) is provided with flexible fingers (382)

that are arranged to snap outwardly once the plug has
been inserted in a hole (342) in one member (312,314) to

enable the plug to be retained in said member.
A spool as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein said first and second members (312,314) are

substantially identical.
A spool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
3, further including an outer end wall (360) and an inner

sleeve (338,338') disposed concentrically within said
outer cylindrical wall (332,332').
A spool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
4, wherein annular flanges (324,324') are disposed at the

outer ends of said cylindrical wall (332,332').
A spool as claimed in claim 5, wherein at
least one of said members (312,314) is formed with a

secondary winding surface (328,328') extending axially
away from a corresponding annular flange (324,324').
A spool as claimed in claim 6, wherein said
secondary winding surface (328,328') is bounded between

said annular flange (324,324') and an auxiliary flange
(394) axially spaced from said annular flange.
A spool as claimed in claim 7, wherein said
annular flange (324,324') is formed with slots connecting

said secondary winding surface (328,328') to said winding
space.
A spool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
8, wherein a shock absorbing sleeve (391) is mounted on

the cylindrical wall (332,332') to protect said
filamentary material disposed in said winding space.
