<ABSTRACT>
A composition comprising an alkenyl polysiloxane having 
not less than two alkenyl groups per molecule and a polysiloxane 

having not less than two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms 
per molecule. The alkenylpolysiloxane comprises a mixture of 

polysiloxanes having a viscosity at 25°C of not greater than 10 
Pa.s. one having not more than two alkenyl groups per molecule 

another having not less than three alkenyl groups per molecule. 
The polysiloxane having not less than two silicon-bonded 

hydrogen atoms per molecule has a viscosity at 25°C of not 
greater than 10 Pa.s. and no more than two silicon-bonded 

hydrogen atoms per molecule. The compositions are of low initial 
viscosity and yet cure to give elastomers with good strength 

and elongation to break. The compositions are useful, for 
example, as mould making materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with curable compositions
and with articles formed therefrom.It is known to use curable compositions for the
production of flexible silicone rubber articles. Suitable
curable compositions cure without heat by a condensation
reaction which involves crosslinking of hydroxy end-blocked
polysiloxane chains through siloxane linkages accompanied
by release of a condensation product, e.g. an alcohol from
an alkoxy silane crosslinking agent, in the presence of a
suitable catalyst. These curable compositions have many
useful properties but their use entails the production and
evaporation of condensation products as aforesaid during
cure and shortly thereafter. This causes shrinkage of the
cured rubber articles.In cases where dimensional accuracy is required,
curable compositions are used which cure without
elimination of by-products and which do not shrink upon
curing. These compositions generally comprise a polysiloxane
having vinylorganosiloxane units, an organohydrogen
polysiloxane and finely divided filler and cure by
a hydrosilylation reaction in the presence of a noble metal
catalyst. Such compositions may comprise, for example, as
the polysiloxane having vinylorganosiloxane units and
finely divided filler, vinyl terminated polydimethylsiloxanes
and finely divided silica treated in the
composition to render it hydrophobic by the presence of
hexamethyl disilazane, or a high viscosity vinyl terminated
polydimethylsiloxane, vinylsiloxane resin and finely
divided inert extending filler for example ground quartz;
compositions of the first mentioned type cure to strong
rubbers by virtue of the silica and compositions of the
second type do so by virtue of the presence of the resin. 
Generally, such compositions have, when mixed, a viscosity of
the order of from about 50 Pa.s to about 100 Pa.s and after
curing exhibit maximum elongation-to-break values of the order
of 300% to 400% and tear strength values of the order of about
10 to 20 kN/m.In EP 409 229A2 there is described an addition-type
silicone rubber composition which comprises an organopolysiloxane
containing at least two alkenyl groups bonded to a
silicon atom in one molecule, an organohydrogen polysiloxane
containing at least two silicon bonded hydrogen atoms per
molecule, a platinum catalyst and an additive consisting of an
organopolysiloxane containing one silicon-bonded alkenyl group
on average per molecule. The application is concerned with
compositions which, when cured, form elastomers with low
modulus; in order to
