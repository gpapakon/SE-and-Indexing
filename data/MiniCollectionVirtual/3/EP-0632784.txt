<ABSTRACT>
Unit consisting, according to one embodiment of the invention, of two non-rigid bottles (A, B) which, uncovered, are intended for different liquids. By applying manual pressure (P) on the non-rigid bottles (A, B), the liquids are transferred with the aid of linking tubes (T) to a dosing/dispensing container (C) shared by both bottles. Marks (M) are included on the walls of said container, indicating the volume, so that the final liquid, dosed and mixed in the doser/dispenser is dispensed, using a suitable application system, especially the pour-on system. Optionally, the unit can also consist of a package of two or more bottles having a similar liquid transfer and dosing/dispersing system.
