<ABSTRACT>
A pedal for an automobile includes an auxiliary pedal 
member (30) connected to a pedal plate (12) so that the 

radius of gyration of the auxiliary pedal member (30) may 
be adjusted in accordance with the length of a driver's 

leg.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pedals for automobiles as
specified in the preamble of claim 1. Such pedals are well-known.Automobiles are ordinarily equipped with foot operated
pedals such as an accelerator, clutch and brake,
Referring to Figure 1 of the accompanying diagrammatic
drawings, showing the general relationship between a
conventional pedal and a car seat, a pedal 1 having a
predetermined length is hinged to a plate 2. Here, in
order to facilitate pedal operation when seated on a
driver's seat 3 having a seat back 4, the operator
(driver) adjusts the seat forward or backward according to
the driver's height, or more specifically, according to
the length of the driver's legs.However, when a very short-legged driver drives with
driver's seat 3 pulled completely forward, certain
inconveniences and/or problems follow. First, when the
driver uses a side mirror or rear-view mirror, his of her
head is in an awkwardly contorted position, making it
difficult to simultaneously observe forward and side
areas, which is unsafe. Second, since the driver is thus
positioned uncomfortably close to the steering wheel,
proper wheel operation is difficult. Third, when the
driver operates the pedal, the leg's articulate angle is
almost rectangular so that easy operation of the
automobile is hindered.On the other hand, if the driver chooses to drive with
driver's seat 3 pushed too far back for the length of his
or her legs, the driver operates the pedals with his or
her legs overly extended, which quickens leg fatigue
during long trips. In an attempt to remedy this
situation, drivers often fix driver's seat 3 at a position 
sufficiently forward so that the pedal is easy to operate,
and then angles the seat back 4 in order to increase the
distance between his or her upper body and the steering
wheel. In such an event, the driver is in a near prone
position which is not conducive for safe driving, nor is
it comfortable since it tends to create pains in the neck,
shoulder or back.US 2 931 246 discloses a means for increasing leverage in
motor vehicle brake pedals, in which an auxiliary pedal
bears directly against the brake pedal. As the auxiliary
pedal is depressed, its effective lever arm on the brake
pedal is increased. Although this might be useful for a
brake pedal, it could be quite dangerous for other
automobile pedals such as accelerators. There is some
modest adjustment possible of the length of the lever arm
of the auxiliary pedal. However, the auxiliary pedal is
not always closer to the driver, when
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pedal (1) for an automobile comprising:

a pedal lever (91) that may be depressed and released by
the foot of a driver seated in a driver's compartment of

an automobile such that the pedal (1) is moveable away
from and towards the driver's seat (3); and
a pedal plate (42) that extends transversely of the pedal

lever (91):

characterised in that:

said pedal lever (91) comprises two pedal lever members
(91,75) which are provided with respective slots (91',75')

and releasable fastening means (100,101) such that the
positions of the pedal lever members (91,75) are

adjustable with respect to one another in order to adjust
the length of the pedal lever (91) away from and towards

the driver's seat (3); and
said fastening means (100,101) is manually operable and
accessible within the driver's compartment.
A pedal according to claim 1, wherein said pedal
lever members (91,75) are provided with interengaging

protrusions (91'',75'') to inhibit sliding between the pedal
lever members (91,75).
A pedal according to claim 2, wherein a plurality of
said protrusions (202) are formed at predetermined

intervals on a face of one of said pedal lever members
(200);
 
the other of said pedal lever members (211) is hollow to

define a coupling hole (217) to receive said one pedal
lever member (200), and is provided with a further hole

(216) communicating with said coupling hole (217); and

a leaf spring (220) is located in said further hole (216)
and is formed with a further said protrusion to engage

said protrusions (202) on said one pedal lever member
(200).
A pedal according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein
protrusions (32') are formed on said pedal plate (32), to

inhibit sliding of a driver's foot on said pedal plate.
A pedal according to any of the preceding claims,
further comprising connection means (21) for connecting

one of said pedal lever members (22) to an existing pedal
plate (12), such that the first-mentioned pedal plate (32)

is an auxiliary pedal plate located at a position that is
nearer the driver's seat (3) than said existing pedal

plate (12).
A pedal according to claim 5, wherein said connection
means (21) comprises a pair of plates (128,129) adapted to

be secured at opposite faces of an existing pedal plate
(12).
An automobile provided with a pedal according to any
of the preceding claims.
