<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for fastening an air bag (6) inside an air bag housing (1). To achieve this, the edge of the air bag aperture is provided with a hem stitched edge (11) into which a rod (13) is inserted or sewn. Together with this rod (13), the edge of the air bag aperture can be clipped into a groove (17) which is formed by resilient limbs (21) of a frame (16). Together with the frame (16), the air bag (6) is inserted in the housing (1), the rigid walls of the housing causing the resilient limbs (21) of the frame (16) to enclose the rod (13). At the same time as the frame (16) is inserted in the housing (1), a positive connection is established between the frame (16) and the housing (1), the groove (17) being either inserted into a channel (23) extending in the housing (1) or being pressed into a frame guide from the chamber (5) for the air bag (6). In the latter case, an outer edge of the resilient limbs is situated behind a projection of the frame guide. The frame (16) is arranged between the chamber (7) for the gas generator (8) and the chamber (5) for the air bag in this manner. It has openings (27) for the specific passage of the gas generated. The openings can be covered by a filter.

Fixing of an airbag in the housing of an airbag 
module, wherein this housing (1) surrounds the folded 

airbag (6) in one chamber (5) as well as a gas generator 
(8) for inflating the airbag in another chamber (7) and 

the airbag can be fixed by its edge (11) to the housing 
(1) between the two chambers, characterised in that the 

edge of the airbag opening in a manner known in the art 
is constructed as a hollow seam (11) and in the hollow 

seam (11) is contained a rod (13, 15, 13'), the hollow 
seam (11) with the rod (13, 15, 13') located therein lies 

in a channel (17, 18, 17') of a frame (16, 16') which 
keeps the airbag in the fitted position, which channel 

(17, 18, 17') is closable by spring arms (21, 24, 21') 
the spring arms (21, 24, 21') are brought by the housing 

(1, 1') of the airbag module in the fitted position by 
form locking into a closed position encompassing hollow 

seam (11) and rod (13, 15, 13') and in the process the 
channel (17, 18, 17') of the frame (16, 16') is held in 

form-locking relationship in the housing (1, 1'). 
Fixing according to claim 1, characterised in that in 
the housing (1) between the chamber (5) for the airbag 

(6) and the chamber (7) for the gas generator (8) on 
either side is provided a groove (23) which is wider at 

the bottom than at the open upper side, and the channels 
(17) of the frame (16) with the rods (13) and the hollow 

seam (11) of the opening of the airbag (6) encompassing 
them as well as with the spring arms (21) are inserted 

longitudinally in the grooves (23), wherein the edges of 
the grooves (23) keep the spring arms (21) in the closed 

position.  
 
Fixing according to claim 1, characterised in that a peripheral 
frame guide (23') is provided in housing (1') 

between chamber (5') for the airbag (6') and chamber 
(7') for the gas generator (8') and a channel (17') 

of frame (16') which comprises a bar (13') located in hollow seam (11) 
 of the airbag opening (6') as well as spring arms (21'), is pressed into frame guide (23') from chamber (5') for airbag (6'), 

 whereby the spring arms 
(21') reach a closed position and their upper free 

edge engages behind a projection (26) of the frame 
guide (23').  

 
Fixing according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that only the longitudinal sides (12) of the airbag 

opening are fixed to the frame (16). 
Fixing according to claim 1, characterised in that 
both the longitudinal sides (12) and the short sides (14) 

of the airbag opening are fixed to the frame (16). 
Fixing according to claims 1 and 5, characterised in 
that the spring arms (24) of the channels (18) of the 

frame (16) which hold the short sides (14) of the airbag 
opening are in the fitted position held in the closed 

position by the cover portions (3, 4). 
Fixing according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the frame (16, 16') is provided with apertures (27) 

for passage of the inflating gas. 
Fixing according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
apertures (27) are covered with a filter.
