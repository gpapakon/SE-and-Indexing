<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an air-oxy-fuel method and apparatus in which 
fuel is burned in first and second stages of combustion having a fuel-rich and 

fuel-lean stoichiometry, respectively, to reduce NO
x
 emissions. The fuel is 
burned in the first stage of combustion in oxygen. The combustion of the fuel is 

completed in the second stage of combustion in the presence of air. Mixing of 
fuel and oxygen is effected by forming fuel and oxygen jets in close proximity to 

one another. Air is then swirled around the fuel and oxygen jets at a swirl ratio 
of no less than about 0.6 so that combustion products of the first stage of 

combustion recirculate to obtain stable combustion of a very fuel-rich flame 
which is characterized by increased flame luminosity. The use of air allows for 

a lesser degree of swirling than had a single oxidant been used in both the first 
and second stages of combustion because a greater mass of air is supplied than 

oxygen. This in turn allows the air to be swirled with a sufficient forward 
momentum to locate the second stage of combustion directly downstream of 

the first stage of combustion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for burning a fuel in the 
presence of oxygen and air. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
such a burner in which the combustion is staged such that the fuel initially 
burns at a fuel-rich stoichiometry and then at a fuel-lean stoichiometry in first 
and second stages of combustion, respectively. Even more particularly, the 
present invention relates to such an apparatus and method in which oxygen is 
used to support combustion in the first stage of combustion and swirled air or 
oxygen enriched air is employed to support combustion in the second stage of 
combustion. In many industrial processes it is necessary to heat a melt, for instance, glass, 
metals, ferrous and non-ferrous and etc. A variety of burners have been 
provided for such processes that burn a fuel in the presence of an oxidant that 
can consist of air, oxygen, or oxygen-enriched air. Burners that use air alone can generally be said to suffer from a limited 
operating range, power output and a potential for NOx formation resulting from 
combustion of the fuel in airborne nitrogen. In order to reduce NOx formation, 
U.S. 4,297,093 provides a burner in which air is swirled around a fuel jet to 
produce a fuel rich zone of combustion surrounded by a fuel lean zone of 
combustion. Combustion of the fuel in such a manner reduces NOx formation 
and the swirling air acts to insolate the burner from the flame. In order to increase the operating range and available power output of the 
burner, oxy-fuel burners have been developed that utilize oxygen as the oxidant. 
Such burners are compact and are able to produce a high energy output from 
both the rate at which fuel is burned and the luminosity of the flame. Their 
disadvantage is that the flame they produce can result in high localized heat 
fluxes that develop hot spots in the melt. Moreover, the use of oxygen adds to  
 
the costs of the process involved. In order to conserve oxygen, burners termed 
in the art as air-oxy-fuel burners have been developed in which a portion of the 
oxidant is supplied by air to reduce the costs involved in burning a fuel in 
oxygen alone. A potential problem with such burners, is that they are more 
likely to produce high amounts of NOx than burners that use just air to supply 
the oxidant. An example of an air-oxy-fuel burner is U.S. 5,145,361 in which air is aspirated 
in either a flow of fuel gas or oxygen and the resultant mixture is swirled to 
spread out the area in which the

A method of burning fuel comprising: 

introducing fuel and oxygen into a first stage of combustion such that the 
fuel and the oxygen burn at a fuel-rich stoichiometry to produce 

unburned fuel and combustion products; and 
introducing the unburned fuel from the first stage of combustion and an 
oxidant comprising air or oxygen-enriched air into a second stage of 

combustion such that combustion of the fuel is completed at fuel-lean 
stoichiometry; 
the fuel and the oxygen being introduced into the first stage of 
combustion by forming convergent jets of the fuel and the oxygen; 
the unburned fuel and the oxidant being introduced into the second stage 
of combustion by swirling the oxidant around the fuel and oxygen jets 

with tangential and axial momentums; 
the tangential momentum of the oxidant being sufficient to form a 
recirculation zone in the first stage of combustion in which heated 

combustion products circulate at right angles to the swirl of the oxidant; 
and 
the axial momentum of the oxidant being sufficient to project the oxidant 
and therefore the second stage of combustion downstream of the first 

stage of combustion.

jets with a sufficient tangential velocity that a recirculation zone is set up 
in the first stage of combustion in which the combustion products 

recirculate at right angles to the swirl of the oxidant and with a sufficient 
axial velocity that the oxidant and therefore the second stage of

the annular passageway, an inner ring of bores in communication with the
