<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to gas generators having a tubular or cylindrical casing (1), according to the invention holding means (2) being integrally moulded to the inside of a tubular body, extending longitudinally, especially parallel to the axis of the body and being used to accommodate filtering and restraining elements (3) which can be clipped in, are sheet-like in form and have sufficient inherent resilience and/or elasticity for clip fastening to occur. This makes it possible to fix sheet-like filtering and restraining elements in the combustion chamber of a gas generator without additional parts and/or without a welding process.

<CLAIMS>
Gas generator, in particular for releasing passive 
passenger restraint systems in motor vehicles, with a 

tubular or cylindrical body (1) at which filter and 
retaining elements (3) are disposed, characterised in that 

holding means (2) are moulded on in one piece in the tubular 
body (1), which means extend in the longitudinal direction, 

in particular parallel to the axis of the tubular body (1), 
and serve to hold clip-in, planar filter and retaining 

elements (3) which have an inherent resilience or elasticity 
which is sufficient for the clip fastening. 
Gas generator according to claim 1, characterised in that 
at least two parallel webs (2) are provided as the holding 

means at the inner surface of the tubular body (1), and the 
filter and retaining elements (3) can be clipped in between 

these webs (2). 
Gas generator according to claim 2, characterised in that 
a respective pair of webs (2) is disposed at the inner 

surface of the tubular body (1) in a diametrically opposite 
arrangement.
