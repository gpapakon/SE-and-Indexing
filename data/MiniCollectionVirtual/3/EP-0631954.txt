<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method in drum winding 
of a web (P), wherein the roll (13) that is being 

formed is supported on winding drums (11,12), as 
well as a drum winder (10). At least a part of the 

area that surrounds the roll (13) that is being 
formed is subjected to a pressure lower than the 

pressure that prevails in the gap formed by the roll 
(13) that is being formed and the winding drums 

(11,12), whereby a floating effect is produced on 
the roll (13) that is being formed. The drum winder 

(10) is preferably placed in a vacuum chamber (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method in drum winding of a web, according to the preamble of claim 
1, which is based on WO-A-92 033 66. The invention also concerns a drum winder, according to the preamble of claim 5, which is 
based on WO-A-92 033 66. In drum winding, it is desirable to lower the nip loads produced by the weight of the 
growing roll, because otherwise the linear loads that act upon the nips usually 
become excessively high, which results in roll defects. With respect to the prior art, further reference is made, for example, to the publications DE 
1,047,001, DE 1,111,496, DE 3,618,955, and US 3,497,151. In these solutions that 
are known from the prior art, it is known to pass a pressure into the gap formed by 
the roll that is being formed and by the winding drums, whereby a relief effect is 
applied to the roll that is formed, because of which effect the linear loads in the nips 
cannot become excessively high. In order that the pressure should be retained in the 
gap formed by the roll and by the winding drums, it is known from the prior art to 
seal the gap from above and from below, respectively, by means of various sealing 
constructions. From the paper DE 1,047,001, it is known to move the upper roll-end 
sealing unit in the axial direction. From the paper US 3,346,209, it is known to regulate the pressure present in the gap 
formed by the roll and by the winding drums by means of the lower drum by 
moving the drum in the direction up-down. Even though, by means of the prior-art solutions described above, considerable 
improvement is achieved, they, however, involve certain drawbacks. Sealing of the  
 
gap formed by the roll that is formed and by the winding drums is, as a rule, 
problematic. The pressure always leaks to some extent, which results in problems of 
dust formation. Owing to the leakage of the pressure, a very large quantity of air is 
needed to maintain the pressure, which air spreads into the working environment, for 
which reason the dust is readily separated from the web that is wound and spreads 
into the working environment. On the other hand, the prior-art solutions restrict or 
at least hamper some operations that are necessary in the roll formation. One of 
these operations is, for example, the roll change, wherein, when the roll that is 
wound becomes complete, a new roll spool must be fed into the gap between the 
winding drums, the web that is wound must be cut off, and the end of the cut-off 
web must be attached to the new roll spool. Thus, during roll
