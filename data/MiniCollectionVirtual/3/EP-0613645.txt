<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tree holder, in particular Christmas tree holder, with a pot (2) and an insert (3), capable of being inserted into and taken out of the pot (2), for fixing and centering trees, the insert (3) having a ring (10) which coaxially surrounds its longitudinal axis (17) and to which at least two web-like parts (18-20) are fixed, each of which extends up to the outer wall (7) of the pot (2) and whose ends (side parts (21-23)) remote from the ring (10) are guided around the upper edge (4) of the pot (2). In order to guarantee a firm seating of the generally prefabricated inserts (3) in the pot (2) even where the external dimensions vary from one pot to another, the invention proposes to provide at least one resilient frictional connection between the side parts (21-23) and the pot (2). This is preferably achieved in that the side parts (21-23) are bent back inwards towards the longitudinal axis (17) of the insert (3) and contact the outer wall (7) of the pot (3) at least in a region (26,27) in a frictionally locking manner.

A tree holder (1) with a pot (2) and with an insert 
(3) which is insertable into and removable from the pot (2) 

for the securing and centering of trees, in which the 
insert (3) has a ring (10) coaxially surrounding its 

longitudinal axis (17), on which ring (10) at least two 
parts (18-20) in the form of a cross-piece are fastened, 

which extend in each case up to the outer wall (7) of the 
pot (2) and the ends of which (side pieces (21-23)) facing 

away from the ring (10) are guided around the upper rim (4) 
of the pot (2), characterised in that the side pieces 21-23) 

are connected via at least one resilient force-fitting 
connection with the outer wall (7) of the pot (2), in which 

the side pieces (21-23) are bent back at an acute angle 
inwards towards the longitudinal axis (17) of the insert 

(3) with the formation of a free space serving to equalise 
tolerances and in which the side pieces (21-23) touch the 

outer wall (7) of the pot (2) in a force-fitting manner at 
least in one region (26, 27). 
A tree holder according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the radial distance between the longitudinal axis 

(17) of the insert (3) and the region of the respective 
side piece (21-23) with which this presses against the 

outer wall (7) of the pot (2) is selected such that even in 
the case of a pot (2) with the smallest external diameter  

 
coming into consideration, a sufficiently great force fit 

is still present in this wall region (26, 27). 
A tree holder according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the side pieces (21-23) are bent back 

in such a way towards the longitudinal axis (17), and their 
length is so chosen, that with the use of a pot (2) with a 

bead-shaped rim (4) a force-fitting contact of the side 
pieces (21-23) is achieved in the region (27) of the bead-shaped 

rim (4) and if necessary also in a region (26) 
beneath this rim (4). 
A tree holder according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the insert (3) consists of a metal or 

of a plastics material. 
A tree holder according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the pot (2) consists of ceramic, 

glass, porcelain, plastics material or the like. 
A tree holder according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the side pieces (21-23) additionally 

have end sections (29-31) which are directed outwards as a 
handle.
