<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a lineal member (14) having a porous core (10) comprises feeding a shaped elongated porous core (10) through a resin-encasing die (24) wherein resin is injected under pressure to encase the core (10), through a curing die (26) having a cross-sectional shape coinciding with and in contact with the resin-encased lineal member (14), with the curing die (26) imparting sufficient heat to the lineal member (14) to initiate cure of the resin, and through a curing chamber (32) which is maintained at a temperature sufficient to complete the cure of the resin without substantial contact with the lineal member (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONMETHOD FOR MAKING A LINEAL MEMBER TECHNICAL FIELD This invention pertains to making building components, particularly structural members having relatively low thermal conductivity.BACKGROUND ART Recent advances in the manufacture of structural building components have greatly improved the resistance to thermal conductivity in order to conserve energy. This is particularly evident in the manufacture of lineal members for such uses as window frames and door frames. It is now well known that a composite fiberglass lineal structural member can be used to replace traditional construction materials such as wood and aluminum. These composite lineal members are comprised of a relatively porous core material, generally of glass fibers, and an outer coating of strong, aesthetically pleasing resinous casing material. These lineals can be produced through a pultrusion process in which a porous glass wool core is fed through a coating die which coats the glass wool core with a liquid resinous material.In an ordinary pultrusion process, reinforcement fibers are dipped into a liquid resinous bath and pulled through a die to produce the desired cross-sectional shape. The compressed fibers and resin are then passed through a curing die during which the temperature of the resin is raised to a temperature sufficient to initiate the cure of the resin. 

 Pultrusion of lineal members having a porous glass wool core is different from traditional pultrusion processes. The glass wool core is not dipped into a liquid bath of resin because of the need to limit the resin to the outer edges of the glass wool core.Therefore, the glass wool core is pulled through a die in which resin is injected at a relatively low pressure in order to apply resin only in the outer portion of the glass wool core. After the core is coated, the coated lineal member is passed through a curing die which initiates curing of the resin. Typically, the resin is a polyester resin.One of the problems with the pultrusion of porous- cored structural lineal members is that the curing process is not completed in the curing die. If the curing die were long enough to complete the curing process, it would be of such length that the drag force would be prohibitively high, and the core material would break because of the limitations in its tensile strength. In the traditional pultrusion processes the pultruded material emerges from the curing die with the cure of the resin initiated, and the residual heat of the dense resin and glass composite material is

CLAIMS
1. The method for making a lineal member having a porous core comprising feeding a shaped, elongated porous core: through a resin-encasing die wherein resin is injected under pressure lower than about 207 kPa (30 psi) to encase the core, the resin being of the type which releases gasses during curing, through a curing die having a cross-sectional shape coinciding with and in contact with the resin- encased lineal member, with the curing die imparting sufficient heat to the lineal member to initiate cure of the resin, and through a curing chamber which is maintained at a temperature sufficient to complete the cure of the resin without substantial contact with the lineal member.
2. The method of claim 1 in which the resin is a polyester resin and curing the resin results in offgasing of styrene from the lineal member. 3. The method of claim 1 in which the porous core has a density less than about 320 kg/m

 (20 lbs./ft
3
) .
4. The method of claim 3 in which the porous core has a density within the range of from about 96 kg/m
3

3
) . 5. The method of claim 1 in which the ratio of the length of the curing chamber to the length of the curing die is within the range of from about 1.5:1 to about 8:1.
6. The method of claim 1 comprising subjecting the encased lineal to an additional coating step including heating the encased lineal to a temperature of at least 60°C (140"F) after the encased lineal is coated.
7. The method of claim 6 in which the additional 


coating step is a painting process which includes heating the encased lineal to a temperature of at least 60°C (140
β
F) after the encased lineal is painted.
8. The method of claim 1 in which the drag force applied by the curing chamber on the lineal member is less than about 0.91 kg (2 lbs.).
