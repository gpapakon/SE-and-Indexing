Process for testing a fitting (1) operated by 
a medium, which fitting has a closing means, in 

particular a fitting (1) which is pneumatically or 
hydraulically operated and/or controlled by its own 

medium, wherein, during a switching operation of the 
fitting (1), as the actual condition, the time 

characteristics of a measured variable relevant to the 
system and of a measured variable relevant to the 

fitting are measured, 
characterised in that
 a stroke 
factor of the fitting (1) is derived as the function-specific 

variable from the time characteristics of a 
medium pressure (P
1
, P
2
) in the fitting (1) as the 
measured variable relevant to the system and of a 

stroke (H) of the closing means of the fitting (1) as 
the measured variable relevant to the fitting, and is 

stored as a base variable, which stroke factor is a 
quotient formed by two medium pressures that have been 

determined for two positions of the closing means 
(strokes), in that, during a subsequent switching 

operation of the fitting (1), the stroke factor is 
determined again in the same way and its deviation from 

the stored base variable is monitored. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that,
 for several successive switching operations, the 
respective deviation of the stroke factor from the 

associated base variable is determined and in that the 
trend of the deviations is monitored. 
Process for testing a fitting (1) operated by 
a medium, in particular a fitting (1) which is 

pneumatically or hydraulically operated and/or 
controlled by its own medium, wherein, during a 

switching operation of the fitting (1), as the actual 
condition, the time characteristics of a measured 

variable relevant to the system and of a measured 
variable relevant to the fitting are measured,  

 

characterised in that
 at least one function-specific 
variable is derived from the time characteristics and 

stored as a base variable, in that, for several 
subsequent successive switching operations of the

base variable is determined and stored and in that the 

magnitude of the actual deviation is automatically 
monitored for exceeding the magnitude of the tolerable 

deviation.
