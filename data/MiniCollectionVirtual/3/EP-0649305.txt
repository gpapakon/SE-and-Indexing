<ABSTRACT>
Alleviation of stomach ulcers in swine which are being administered exogenous somatotropin, by administering to the swine a benzimidazole compound selected from heterocyclylalkyl(sulfinyl or thio) benzimidazoles and (benzimidazolyl(sulfinyl or thio) alkyl)anilines.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BENZIMIDAZOLES FOR ALLEVIATING STOMACH ULCERS IN SWINEIn swine that are being administered a porcine somatotropin (PST) , e.g., to increase their growth rate, feed-to-meat conversion efficiency, leanness and/or sow milk, the somatotropin may contribute to stomach ulcers which, in severe cases, can cause death. See Smith and Kasson, J. Anim . Sci . 68:4109-16 (1990) and 69:571-77 (1991) . These authors indicate that the mechanism by which somatotropin causes such ulcers is unknown. The difficulty of understanding this mechanism has been increased by the failure of various commonly used anti- ulcer products to alleviate ulcers in swine to which a somatotropin is being administered. For example, histamine H2 receptor antagonists such as Tagamet® cimetidine (SmithKline Beecham) , Zantac® ranitidine (Glaxo) , Pepcid® famotidine (Merck) and Axid® nizatidine (Lilly) are widely used in treating stomach ulcers in humans. However, a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (ranitidine) has been found to have little effect for alleviating ulcers in PST-treated swine when 150 mg/day of the ranitidine is administered by 3X daily injection for 7 days.Also commonly used for ulcer treatment are cytoprotectants, such as those containing Al(OH)3 andMg(OH)2, e.g., Carafate® sucralfate (Marion Merrell Dow), and De-Nol® colloidal bismuth subcitrate (Gist- Brocades) . These form a complex with proteinaceous exudate (albumin) at the ulcer site and thus present a film barrier against diffusion of hydrogen ions to stomach epithelial tissue. However, the addition of 1 or 4 gm sucralfate/3 kg of a finely ground pelleted diet fed to PST-treated 58-67 kg swine has been ineffective or inconclusive for alleviating stomach ulcers, and the administration of 500 mg/day of De-Nol was likewise ineffective. 

 Various E-type prostaglandins have unequivocally demonstrated an ability to alleviate ulcers in humans. However, the synthetic prostaglandin E., methyl ester, Cytotec® misoprostol (Searle) , has been found to have very little effect in alleviating ulcer development in PST-treated hogs using 2X daily oral gavages of isoprostal totaling either 400 or 800 μg/day. Free-radical scavengers have been found to alleviate stomach ulcers in hogs not being treated with PST. For example, Vitamin U has been found effective against diet-induced ulceration in hogs.

<CLAIMS>
We claim:
1. A method for alleviating stomach ulcers in swine which are being administered exogenous somatotropin, which comprises administering to swine, in an amount effective to alleviate said ulcers, a benzimidazole compound selected from heterocyclylalkyl(sulfinyl or thio)benzimidazoles and [benzimidazolyl(sulfinyl or thio)alkyl]anilines.
2. A method of Claim 1 in which the benzimidazole compound is a 2-[2-pyridylmethyl(sulfinyl or thio) ]benzimidazole.
3. A method of Claim 2 in which the benzimidazole compound is 2-[2-pyridylmethylthio]benzimidazole.
4. A method of Claim 2 in which the benzimidazole compound is 2-[2-pyridylmethylsulfinyl]benzimidazole.
5. A method of Claim 2 in which the benzimidazole compound is 5-methoxy-2-[ (4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2- pyridyl) ethylsulfinyl]benzimidazole.
6. A method of Claim 1 in which the benzimidazole compound is administered by injection contemporaneously with the somatotropin.
7. An article of manufacture comprising a porcine somatotropin and a benzimidazole compound selected from heterocyclylalkyl(sulfinyl or thio)-benzimidazoles and [benzimdiazolyl(sulfinyl or thio)akkyl]anilines, said article being useful for contemporaneous injection of the somatotropin and the benzimidazole compound into swine in a form suitable to effect prolonged release into the circulatory system of the swine of the somatotropin in an amount and at a rate effective to increase the growth rate, feed-to-meat conversion efficiency, leanness or sow milk production of the swine, and of the benzimidazole compound in an amount and at a rate effective to alleviate stomach ulcers in the swine. 



 8. An article of manufacture of Claim 7 in which the benzimidazole compound is a 2-[2-pyridylmethyl (sulfinyl or thio) ]benzimidazole.
9. An article of manufacture of Claim 8 in which the benzimidazole compound is 2-[2-pyridylmethylthio] benzimidazole.
10. An article of manufacture of Claim 8 in which the benzimidazole compound is 2-[2-pyridylmethyl sulfinyl]-benzimidazole. 11. An article of manufacture of Claim 8 in which the benzimidazole compound is 5-methoxy-2-[ (4-methoxy-
3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]benzimidazole.
12. An article of manufacture of Claim 8 which is useful for contemporaneous injection of solid pellets of the somatotropin and solid pellets of the benzimidazole compound into swine to effect said prolonged release.
