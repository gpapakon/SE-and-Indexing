<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conveyor provided with a 
frame and with an endless drivable transport means, which is 

fitted with 
carriers (1) extending transversely to the direction of movement (A) 

of the 
transport means and parallel to each other. At least some of 

the carriers (1) 
support pusher shoes (2), which are movable along the respective 

carriers (1) near 
discharge places by guide means mounted on the frame and by 

control means (3) 
cooperating with said guide means and being connected to said 

pusher shoes (2). 
A control means (3) is pivotable about a pivot pin (8) with respect 

to a respective 
pusher shoe (2), between a first position, in which said control 

means (3) is 
caught by the guide means, and a second position, in which the 

control 
means (3) is able to move beyond the reach of said guide means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a conveyor provided with a
frame and with an endless drivable transport means, which is fitted with
carriers extending transversely to the direction of movement of the
transport means and parallel to each other, which carriers are pivotally
coupled to at least one endless flexible coupling means, whilst at least
some of said carriers support pusher shoes, which are movable along the
respective carriers near discharge places by guide means
mounted on the frame and by control means cooperating with said guide means
and being connected to said pusher shoes, in order to discharge objects
which are present on the transport means transversely to the longitudinal
direction of said transport means.Conveyors of this type are for example known from
European Patent Application 0084905 or Dutch Patent Application 9100562. It is noted that from US-A-5,191,959 there is known a
conveyor of the above cited type wherein the pusher shoes have been
provided with control means formed by rollers. Said rollers have been
mounted on shafts which can be shifted with respect to the pusher
shoes in order to bring the rollers in desired positions with respect
to guide means mounted on the frame of the conveyor.EP-A-0 314 519 discloses an automatic sorting system
comprising moving members. Each moving member supports a slidable rod
which can be shifted in its longitudinal direction for co-operating
with guide means in order to displace the moving member in a desired
way along rods supporting the moving member. With these known constructions the control means
connected to the pusher shoe are usually made up of pins, rollers or the
like secured to the pusher shoes, which cooperate with guide means, which
can be shifted between a first position, in which the guide means allow
the control means to pass without impediment, and a second position, in
which the guide means divert the control means transversely to the
direction of movement of the transport means, in order to effect that the
pusher shoes coupled to the respective control means are moved along the
respective carriers.The shifting of the guide means between the one position
and the other takes some time and of course it must be prevented that a
control means comes into contact with the guide means during this shifting
of the guide means between the one position and the other, since this may
cause serious damage to the device.There is a tendency, however, to increase the working
speed of conveyors of this type more and more. The amount of time required

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor provided with a frame and with an endless
drivable transport means, which is fitted with carriers (1) extending

transversely to the direction of movement (A) of the transport means and
parallel to each other, which carriers (1) are pivotally coupled to at least

one endless flexible coupling means, whilst at least some of said carriers (1)
support pusher shoes (2), which are movable along the respective carriers (1) near

discharge places by guide means mounted on the frame and by
control means (3) cooperating with said guide means and being connected to

said pusher shoes (2), in order to discharge objects which are present on the
transport means transversely to the longitudinal direction of said

transport means, characterized in that the control means (3) is pivotable about
a pivot axis (8) with respect to a respective pusher shoe (2), between a first

position, in which said control means (3) is caught by the guide means, and
a second position (3'), in which the control means (3) is able to move beyond the

reach of said guide means.
A conveyor according to claim 1, characterized in
that the control means (3) is pivotable about a pivot axis (8) which extends at

least substantially parallel to the longitudinal direction of the carrier (1).
A conveyor according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said pivot axis (8) is located before the control means (3), seen in the

intended direction of movement (A) of the transport means.
A conveyor according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said control means (3) is made up of a freely

rotatable roller.
A conveyor according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said control means (3) moves through a dead

centre when moving from the one position (3) to the other (3'), and that spring
means (10) are provided, which attempt to keep said control means (3) in the one

or the other position.
