<ABSTRACT>
A pulsed fluid jet surgical instrument includes a cannula 22 extending from 
a handpiece 21, the cannula emitting a pulsed fluid jet for cutting and 

emulsification purposes, and also providing suction for aspiration and 
evacuation of the fluid and tissue. A pressure intensifier piston 

arrangement 36 receives fluid at relatively low pressure, and operates 
reciprocally and reiteratively to pump the fluid through the jet needle 54 

in a series of high pressure pulses, each having a nearly rectangular 
pressure waveform. The pressure intensifier piston is T-shaped, including a 

broad end 37 which divides a drive bore into a driving chamber and a 
retracting chamber. A bistable valve 40 is connected to admit high pressure 

gas into the actuating chamber, driving the piston to translate. The narrow 
end of the piston is disposed in a fluid pumping chamber connected to a 

supply of fluid. The translating piston drives the fluid from the pumping 
chamber through a first check valve into a fluid jet needle, which directs 

the high pressure fluid pulse to a tissue target. The bistable valve 
switches to admit pressurized gas to the retracting chamber, driving the 

piston retrograde and allowing the pumping chamber to refill with fluid 
through a second check valve. There is no high pressure fluid supplied to 

the handpiece, and only the pressure intensifying pumping action of the 
piston creates a high pressure fluid pulse. The gas supply to drive the 

piston is at a relatively low pressure, so that gas pressure cannot 
comprise a safety risk to the patient. Thus failure of the piston mechanism 

cannot result in the emission of a stream of high pressure fluid, and the 
instrument is inherently safer than prior art instruments that are 

connected to a high pressure fluid source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to surgical cutting tools, and more
particularly to cutting tools employing a fluid jet as the active cutting agent.There is currently a great amount of interest in new technologies to replace
or supplant traditional surgical cutting tools such as the scalpel. Laser-based
tools,
electrosurgical cutters, plasma jets, and fluid jets have all been introduced to
improve various surgical and medical procedures. Each technology has
advantages for particular procedures, as well as intrinsic drawbacks. Fluid jet
cutters have several characteristics that make it all attractive new technology. For
example, pulsed fluid jet cutters involve no electrical current or voltage, which can
comprise a safety risk factor in delicate surgeries. Likewise, there is little heat
generated by fluid jets. Indeed, fluid jets are inherently self-cooling.
Also, the
effects of pulsed fluid jets can be extremely localized and directional, unlike
electrosurgical tools and some laser instruments.Moreover, fluid jet cutters excel at removing soft tissue, due to the fact that
high pressure pulsed jets tend to emulsify soft tissue, and the emulsified tissue is
easily transported by aspiration away from the surgical site. In contrast,
competing technologies such as laser cutters and electrosurgical cutters remove
tissue by ablation or electrothermal dissolution. Both of these effects tend to
create collateral thermal damage and necrosis, which is generally unwanted and
often intolerable for medical purposes. Indeed, the fact that fluid jet cutting devices include aspiration and
evacuation as an integral portion of the device is an added benefit for many
surgical procedures. Surgical cutting and excision often involves exsanguination
that occludes the surgical field, and the surgeon must employ an assistant to
aspirate the field to permit adequate visualization. Fluid jet devices that aspirate
the fluid and emulsified tissue also remove the blood and other fluids that might
otherwise affect visualization by the surgeon, and they do so without involving
additional personnel.However, fluid jet devices known in the prior art do exhibit some negative
characteristics that limit their usefulness. Within restricted body cavities and
organs, the volume of fluid introduced by the cutting instrument may exceed the
aspiration ability of the instrument, resulting in distention and expansion that can
have deleterious side effects. The emulsification effect is primarily a consequence
of pulsing the high pressure
