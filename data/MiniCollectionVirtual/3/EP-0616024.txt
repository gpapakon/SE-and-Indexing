<ABSTRACT>
An olive oil which little undergoes any deterioration in quality can be obtained in a high yield by pitting olive fruits on a 
crusher and a strainer, adding 100 to 1,000 ppm of cellulase and optionally protease to the pitt
ed fruits, stirring the mixture at 20 
to 50 Â°C for 30 to 120 min to cause a reaction, and recovering separated oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
recovering an oil component of a good quality, with high 
efficiency, by extracting and separating it from olive 
drupes with stones removed. A general method of extracting olive oil is as 
shown in FIG. 1. That is, olive drupes 1 with leaves 
removed (Step 2) are washed (Step 3), and crushed 
(Step 4) together with stones (pyrenes). The crushed 
olive is kneaded for 30 to 90 minutes in a kneading 
machine (Step 5), and water is added thereto. Then, the 
mixture is transferred to a decanter and the husk is 
removed (Step 6), obtaining juice 10. Subsequently, oil 
is centrifugally separated from the juice 10 (Step 7) 
and filtrated (Step 8), thereby obtaining pure olive 
oil 9. In the above-mentioned method, as the oil component 
present in the stones simultaneously extracted, it 
contaminates the olive oil. Since lipid degradable 
enzyme is contained in a high level in the stones, the 
quality of oil possibly decreases in an extraction step, 
and the flavor and taste of oil tends to deteriorate in 
a storage step. To solve the above-mentioned problems, the stones  
 
should be removed. However, when olive drupes with 
stones removed are treated, as they are, by the above-mentioned 
conventional method, a recovering rate of an 
oil component is extremely low as compared to that 
obtained from olive drupes with stones. In addition, no 
practical methods have been known to remove the stones 
efficiently. Hence, a method for extracting oil from 
the olive drupes with stones removed has not yet been 
adopted in factory production. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a method for extracting oil of a good quality with high 
efficiency from olive drupes with stones removed. The present inventors have conducted intensive and 
extensive studies with a view toward attaining the 
above-mentioned object, and found that using a specific 
enzyme, an oil component can be obtained at a good 
recovering rate from olive drupes with stones removed, 
and that employing specific means in combination, the 
stones can be efficiently removed in a practical manner. The present invention has been achieved based on 
the above-findings, and provides a method for extracting 
an oil component, which comprises the steps of: adding 
either cellulase or cellulase and protease to olive 
drupes with stones removed; reacting the resultant 
mixture while stirring; and separating an elated oil 
component. Further the present invention provides a 
method of performing the
