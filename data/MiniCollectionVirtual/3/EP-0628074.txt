<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with the support of the
Government of the United States of America, and the
Government of the United States of America has certain
rights in the invention.The present invention relates to methods of
activating CD8 cells in vitro with specificity for
particular antigenic peptides, the use of activated CD8
cells in vivo for the treatment of a variety of disease
conditions, and compositions appropriate for these
uses.The efficiency with which the immune system cures
or protects individuals from infectious disease has
always been intriguing to scientists, as it has been
believed that it might be possible to activate the
immune system to combat other types of diseases. Such
diseases include cancer, AIDS, hepatitis and infectious
disease in immunosuppressed patients. While various
procedures involving the use of antibodies have been
applied in those types of diseases, few if any
successful attempts using cytotoxic T cells have been
recorded. Theoretically, cytotoxic T cells would be
the preferable means of treating the types of disease
noted above. However, no in vitro procedures have been
available to specifically activate cytotoxic T cells.Cytotoxic T cells, or CD8 cells as they are
presently known, represent the main line of defense
against viral infections. CD8 lymphocytes specifically
recognize and kill cells which are infected by a virus.
Thus, the cost of eliminating a viral infection is the
accompanying loss of the infected cells. The T cell
receptors on the surface of CD8 cells cannot recognize
foreign antigens directly. In contrast to antibodies, 
antigen must first be presented to the receptors.The presentation of antigen to T cells is
accomplished by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules of the Class I type. The major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) refers to a large
genetic locus encoding an extensive family of
glycoproteins which play an important role in the
immune response. The MHC genes, which are also
referred to as the HLA (human leucocyte antigen)
complex, are located on chromosome 6 in humans. The
molecules encoded by MHC genes are present on cell
surfaces and are largely responsible for recognition of
tissue transplants as "non-self". Thus, membrane-bound
MHC molecules are intimately involved in recognition of
antigens by T cells.MHC products are grouped into three major classes,
referred to as I, II, and III. T cells that serve
mainly as helper cells express CD4 and are primarily
restricted by Class II molecules, whereas CD8-expressing
cells, which

A stable insect cell line comprising:

a human class I MHC gene, operably linked to an
inducible promoter, capable of expressing an empty human

class I MHC antigen on induction of said promoter;
a human β-2-microglobulin gene, operably linked to a
second inducible promoter, capable of expressing a human

β-2-microglobulin protein, on induction of said second
promoter;

   wherein said cell is capable of assembling said
empty MHC class I antigen and said β-2-microglobulin

protein into complexes on the surface of the cell in

second promoters are metallothionein promoters.
The cell line of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said
human class I MHC gene and said human β-2-microglobulin

are 
Drosophila
 cells.
The method of any one of claims 8 to 10, wherein
said human class I MHC gene and/or said human β-2-microglobulin

gene are/is inserted into a pRmHa-3 vector
having the restriction map as set out in Figure 1C.
A method which comprises having produced a cell line
according to any one of claims 8 to 11, the further step

of culturing the cell line to produce the assembled
complexes of the human MHC class I antigen and human β-2-microglobulin.
