<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the combination of a closure cap and a bottle according to the 
preamble of claim 1. Such a cap is known from FR-A-2604151. This known cap has a rod-shaped 
centering element which is encircled by a spaced ring-shaped 
holding means which is adapted to engage the outer circumference of the 
neck of the bottle. The rod-type centering element is adapted for 
insertion into the neck of the bottle. The holding means according to 
this known design projects beyond the centering element. In US-A-3927803 a piercing spout is described having a pointed end portion. This prior art 
document is not concerned with the automatic assembly of the bottle-cap system. The object of the invention is to allow an easy and reliable 
automatic assembly of the bottle/cap system even in extreme out-of 
centre positionings of the bottle neck. The technical solution 
with respect to the object of the invention is 
characterized by the features indicated in the second part of claim 1.  
 The centering element can for instance 
be shaped as a pointed cylindrical body. However, a tiny, needle shaped 
centering element, consequently with a substantially constant cross-section, 
could be applicated as well. The centering element according to a preferred embodiment 
comprises one or more intersecting plate-shaped lips, having a reduced 
width towards the free end. Such a shape of the centering element can 
easily be achieved by injection-moulding.  
 If the centering element divides the space enclosed by the 
bottle neck into different compartments, it is preferable that there 
should be one or more throughflow channels at the base of the centering 
element, for producing a liquid communication between one or more of said 
compartments. It is preferable here that if the cap-shaped element is 
provided with, for example, a delivery channel which can be shut off, 
said delivery channel should open out laterally into such a throughflow 
channel. This makes it impossible for the contents of the bottle to 
remain in one or more of the compartments during emptying of the 
bottle. The cap design according to the present invention is 
excellently suited for production by injection-moulding, with the cap-shaped 
element, holding means and centring elements being made as a single 
moulded piece. The invention will be explained in greater detail below with 
reference to a preferred embodiment shown in the 
figures, in which:

<CLAIMS>
The combination of a closure cap (3) and a bottle (1), the 
bottle having a pouring spout defining the neck (2) of the bottle, 

the cap being provided to be put over the neck of the bottle, said 
cap having holding means (5, 6) extending from the bottom of said 

cap and lockingly engaging the neck of the bottle, and a centering 
element (12) projecting from the bottom of the cap into said pouring 

spout, said centering element being surrounded by said holding 
means, characterised in that the bottle (1) has an upper part 

tapering towards the open end and forming a shoulder portion of 
said bottle, the cap is a single piece body including a skirt 

portion (4) covering said tapered shoulder portion of said bottle, 
and in that the centering element projects beyond said holding 

means (5, 6) and has a pointed distal end with a symmetrical shape 
with respect to the longitudinal axis of the cap. 
Cap according to claim 1, characterised in that the centering 
element (12) divides the space enclosed by the holding means 

(5, 6) into several compartments defining one or more throughflow 
channels (15) extending through the base of the centering element, 

and enabling a liquid communication between said one or more of 
said throughflow channels. 
Cap according to claim 2, characterised in that the cap is 
provided with a preferably closable delivery channel (9), said 

delivery channel opening laterally into said at least one throughflow 
channel (15).
