<ABSTRACT>
Trocar for introduction of endoscopic instruments into cavities, in the form of a hollow body (1) having a head (2) equipped with a sealing means (3) which can be retracted under the effect of introducing the instrument, from an internal channel (2a) of the said head, which channel is in communication with the hollow body (1), characterised in that the head (2) is equipped with arrangements (5) or (9) which can be operated from outside and can alter the diameter of the channel (2a) in order to make it correspond with the diameter of the instrument to be introduced.

<CLAIMS>
Trocar made up of two parts, of the type having
a first cleanable and re-sterilizable part in the form

of a hollow body (1), and a second part formed by a
head (2) having an internal through-channel (2a) in

coaxial alignment with the said hollow body for
introduction of a surgical instrument, the said channel

being subject to a sealing means in the form of an
obturator with a flap valve at 45Â°, mounted so as to

pivot inside the said head,

the head (2) being made of a disposable
material and incorporating all the joints and

mechanisms,
the head (2) and the body (1) being coupled
via a locking system so as to be detachable,
the head (2) being equipped on the inside
with a diameter reducer (5) or (9) pivoting with

respect to an axis parallel to the axis of the trocar
and activated by a lever (5b) or (10) so as to bring

holes of different diameters into coaxial alignment
with part of the channel (2a),
the control lever (5b or 10) being able to be
manoeuvred from outside the head by simple pressure of

the finger.
Trocar according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the diameter reducer is comprised of an

articulated arm (5) having at least one hole (5a) of a
diameter less than that of the channel (2a), and able

to be brought into coaxial alignment with the said
channel (2a) under the action of the lever (5b).
Trocar according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the arm (5) is lodged transversely in a seat (2e)

formed within the thickness of the head (2), upstream
of a sealing member (7) present in the inlet of the

channel (2a) of the head (2), from which the instrument
is introduced. 
Trocar according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the hole or holes (5a) of the arm (5) has or have

a sealing member cooperating with the body of the
corresponding instrument.
Trocar according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the diameter reducer is comprised of a spherical

bushing (9) having at least two through-holes (9a-9b)
of different diameters which can be brought into

coaxial alignment with the channel (2a), under the
action of the lever (10).
Trocar according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the two holes (9a-9b) are in communication and are

disposed in two orthogonal planes.
Trocar according to Claim 6, characterized in
that each hole (9a-9b) has a sealing member cooperating

with the body of the corresponding instrument.
Trocar according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the body (1) has on its periphery, along part or

all of its length, adjoining external flutings.
