<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a functional epitope which is purified from human HSP 90 or which is synthesised to correspond to such a purified epitope, which is, if purified, unchanged or changed by substitution of selected amino acids and if synthesised is identical to a purified epitope or differs from a purified epitope by substitution of selected amino acids, and which cross-reacts with an antibody raised against a stress protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns stress protein epitopes
intended inter alia for use in diagnosis and treatment
of disease states in which stress proteins are produced.Environmental stress can induce an increase in
the rate of synthesis of so-called heat shock, or
stress, proteins in both procaryotic and eucaryotic
cells (see for example Schlesinger et al (eds) in: Heat
Shock from Bacteria to Man, Cold Spring Harbor, New
York, (1972)). Although the function of the stress
proteins has yet to be finally resolved, some have been
reported to participate in assembly and structural
stabilisation of certain cellular and viral proteins,
and their presence at high concentration may have an
additional stabilising effect during exposure to adverse
conditions.Many pathogenic organisms have been shown to
produce stress proteins (see Young et al, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA, 85, 4267-4270 (1988)). The proteins are
thought to be produced in response to the stress of
infection to help protect the invading pathogen. Thus,
for example, the ability to produce stress proteins has
been implicated in the survival of bacterial pathogens
within macrophages (Christmas et al, Cell, 41, 753-762 
(1985) and Morgan et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83,
8059-8063 (1986)).Burnie et al, (GB 90307236.1, WO 92/01717),
have found that stress proteins from both fungi and
bacteria, for example, Candida albicans and
Corynebacteriumjeikium, comprise an immunodominant
conserved antigen. The carboxy end of the Candidal
stress protein has been sequenced and an antibody raised
against the epitope LKVIRKNIVKKMIE found to recognise
both the 47 and 92Kd Candidal stress proteins in sera
from patients suffering from systemic Candidal
infection. In addition, the antibodies also recognised
stress proteins in sera of patients suffering from other
fungal infection, for example, the 40 and 88/84 Kd
Aspergillus stress proteins, as well as stress proteins
in sera from patients suffering from bacterial
infection, for example, the 52 and 86Kd Coryneform
stress proteins. Other peptide sequences from the
Candidal stress protein were found to be immunogenic,
for example, the epitopes LSREM, LKVIRK and STDEPAGESA
reacted with sera from patients with systemic
candidiasis.The entire human 89kDa heat shock protein
(HSP90) gene has been sequenced (Hickey et al, Mol.
Cell. Biol., 9, 2615-2626, 1989) and its amino acid
sequence deduced and compared to that of heat shock 
proteins of other species. Although it appears that the
class of heat shock proteins is highly conserved
