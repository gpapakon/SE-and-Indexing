<ABSTRACT>
The possibility of passing off apparent "good" higher level digital
signals that may include corrupted or failed lower level digital signals because of

inter-ring grooming of the lower level digital signals from a bidirectional line-switched
ring to a path-switched ring and vice versa which employ first and second

shared nodes is minimized by dual feeding communications circuits from the
bidirectional line-switched ring to the path-switched ring and vice versa via the

shared nodes. An inter-ring groomed communications circuit is provisioned from a
secondary ring node in the line-switched ring of one of the shared nodes (secondary

communications circuit) to be supplied to a primary ring node in the other of the
shared nodes of the line-switched ring. A replica of the secondary communications

circuit is demultiplexed to obtain the lower level digital signals, which are evaluated
on a pair-wise basis with corresponding lower level digital signals from the primary

ring node. The least corrupted of the evaluated lower level signals are selected to be
combined into a new primary communications circuit which is to be inserted in the

line-switched transmission path. An inter-ring groomed communications circuit is
provisioned from a secondary ring node of one of the shared nodes in the path-switched

ring to be supplied to a primary ring node in the other shared node of the
path-switched ring. The secondary communications circuit is demultiplexed to

obtain the lower level signals which are evaluated on a pair-wise basis with lower
level signals from a corresponding primary communications circuit to determine

which of the lower level signals are least corrupted. The selected least corrupted
lower level signals are combined into a new primary communications circuit which

is then dual fed in the path-switched ring primary ring node.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ring transmission systems and, more particularly, to
interworking between bidirectional line-switched ring transmission systems.It has become increasingly important to maintain communications connectivity
in the presence of transmission system failures. To this end, ring interworking
arrangements have been proposed for transporting communications circuits between
bidirectional line-switched rings. Ring interworking is essentially a dual feed of
communications circuits from a first ring to a second ring. The dual feeding takes place
across two different sites, each with ring nodes for both the first and second rings, in
order to provide the physical diversity necessary to enable the cross-ring
communications circuits to survive a failure of one of the two shared sites. The second
ring performs a receive switch based on some parameter or set of parameters of the two
signals being fed from the first ring. For the other direction of the same end-to-end
cross-ring communications circuits, the second ring dual feeds communications circuits
to the first ring. The first ring performs a receive switch of the two signals being fed
from the second ring.For example, in US-A-5 218 604, a pair of serving nodes are interposed in each
of two independent hybrid rings. To propagate signals from the first hybrid ring to the
second hybrid ring, the first serving node couples both unidirectional paths of the first
hybrid to the first unidirectional path of the second hybrid. The second serving node
couples both unidirectional paths of the first hybrid to the second unidirectional path of
the second hybrid. To propagate signals from the second ring to the first ring, the first
serving node couples both unidirectional paths of the second hybrid to the second
unidirectional path of the first hybrid. The second serving node couples both
unidirectional paths of the second hybrid to the first unidirectional path of the first
hybrid. The pair of serving nodes provides a protected interconnection between
multiple survivable ring networks. Any traffic (i.e., channels) that passes between rings
is fully and automatically protected against the loss of a serving node, where a serving
node provides paths between rings. For survivability of traffic, protection against the
loss of a serving node is essential in addition to having protection against a break in the
ring. A problem arises when there is a need to groom the inter-ring communications
traffic by way of intervening wide-band digital cross-connect systems
