<ABSTRACT>
The present method is a method of electrochemical stripping analysis comprising an electrolysis step and a stripping step. In the method is used an electrode device comprising an electrode body carrying a working electrode, a reference electrode, and a counter electrode. The electrode device comprises a measuring area located at an outer surface of the device, into which area the working electrode opens and wherein at least one contact point for the reference electrode and the counter electrode is located. The electrode device is adapted for dipping into a sample solution contained in a sample container. The measuring area of the electrode device has a surface character appropriate for retaining an aqueous sample residue at said surface after removal of the electrode device from the sample solution. Said residue is of sufficient size to maintain electric contact between the working electrode and the contact point for the reference electrode and the counter electrode and is preferably of sufficient size to completely cover the working electrode. Thus, during displacement from one solution to another, the working electrode is protected from damage caused by an uncontrolled electrode potential, from drying out, and from formation of contaminations. By means of the present method it is possible to perform the electrolysis step of the analysis in the sample and perform the stripping step in another more appropriate solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of electrochemical 
stripping analysis comprising an electrolysis step and 
a stripping step and using an electrode device comprising 
an electrode body carrying a working electrode, a 
reference electrode, and a counter electrode, said 
electrode device further comprising a measuring area 
into which the working electrode opens and wherein at 
least one contact point for the reference electrode and 
the counter electrode is located, the method comprising 
contacting the electrode device with a sample solution 
and performing the electrolysis step with the measuring 
area contacting at least part of the sample solution. In this context electrochemical stripping analysis 
comprises analyses of the type stripping potentiometry 
(Potentiometric Stripping Analysis - PSA and Constant 
Current Stripping Analysis - CCSA) and stripping voltammetry. 
Said measuring methods are mostly used in the 
determination of heavy metals as for example Pb, Cu, 
Cd, Hg, Zn, Ni, and Co in various solutions such as 
water, wine, blood, etc. The said electrochemical measuring methods have in 
common that the particular ions in the sample are at 
first deposited on a working electrode by means of 
electrolysis. The method used for stripping off the 
ions and the parameters monitored concurrently depend 
on the particular measuring method. In Potentiometric Stripping Analysis stripping is performed 
by removing the electrolysis potential and 
stripping off the ions by spontaneous chemical reaction 
in the solution contacting the working electrode. While  
 
stripping off a particular type of ions, the electrode 
potential measured relatively to a reference electrode 
will lie constantly on a potential characteristic for 
said ion. Consequently, during stripping the electrode 
potential is measured as a function of time and the 
time the electrode remains at a particular potential is 
thus a measure of the sample content of a particular 
type of ions. In Constant Current Stripping Analysis, stripping off 
the ions is controlled by sending an appropriately 
directed constant current through the electrode. As 
with PSA the measured electrode potential while stripping 
off one type of ions will lie constantly on a 
potential characteristic for said ion type and the 
electrode potential as a function of time is used in 
determining the ion content in this method as well. In Voltammetric Stripping Analysis the ions are 
stripped off by applying an alternating potential 
across the electrode directed
