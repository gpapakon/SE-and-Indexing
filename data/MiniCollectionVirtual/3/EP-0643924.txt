<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to the unpacking of 
tobacco cases. In order to transport tobacco leaf material to a 
cigarette manufacturing facility, the material is packed 
as a compressed bale. The bales are protected by being 
packed in, for example, a carton board packing box, a so 
packaged bale commonly being referred to as a "case". The 
bales and boxes are usually of rectilinear conformation 
and the boxes often comprise an inner part, consisting of 
walls and a base, and an outer part consisting of walls 
and a top, the inner part being slidably received in the 
outer part. The top of the outer part of such box usually 
comprises opening flaps. The bale within the box is 
commonly wrapped in plastics sheet material. Before the tobacco leaf material can be subjected to 
requisite processing in the cigarette manufacturing 
facility it is, of course, necessary to unpack the case, 
i.e. to separate the packing box from the bale therein, 
which step is commonly referred to as "decasing". 
Decasing units are known, one such being described in EP 
117 036. It is a feature of the decasing unit of EP 117 
036 that it occupies a considerable amount of floor space. It is an object of the subject invention to provide a 
simple, effective and compact decasing unit. The subject invention provides a tobacco bale 
decasing unit comprising frame means, from which frame  
 
means are mounted support means, transfer means and case 
gripping means, said support means and said transfer means 
being relatively movable towards and away from each other, 
said gripping means being movable into and out of a case 
gripping condition and also being relatively movable 
towards and away from said transfer means, and said frame 
means being rotatable between a position in which said 
support means is beneath said transfer means to a position 
in which said support means is above said transfer means. The subject invention further provides a method of 
unpacking a tobacco case comprising a tobacco bale 
contained within a packing box, in which method the upper 
flaps of said box are folded back to the sides of said 
box, said case is disposed above support means of a 
decasing unit and below transfer means of said decasing 
unit, said support means and said transfer means are 
brought to a condition wherein said case is held between 
said support means and said transfer means, said support 
means and said transfer means are rotated together so as 
to effect inversion of said case, case gripping means is 
brought into a

<CLAIMS>
A tobacco bale decasing unit comprising frame means, 
from which frame means are mounted support means, 

transfer means and case gripping means, said support 
means and said transfer means being relatively 

movable towards and away from each other, said 
gripping means being relatively moveable into and out 

of a case gripping condition and also relatively 
movable towards and away from said transfer means, 

and said frame means being rotatable between a 
position in which said support means is beneath said 

transfer means to a position in which said support 
means is above said transfer means. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said frame 
means comprises first and second, relatively movable 

sections. 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein said transfer 
means is mounted of the first of said sections. 
Apparatus according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein said 
support means is mounted of the second of said 

sections. 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein said 
frame means comprises actuating means, said actuating 

means being operable to effect relative movement of 
said first and second sections of said frame means.  

 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 2 to 5, 
wherein said case gripping means is mounted of said 

second section of said frame means. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said transfer means takes the form of 

a conveyor. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said support means takes the form of 

a plurality of forks. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said case gripping means comprises 

case wall piercing means and powering means, said 
powering means being operable to move said piercing 

means between a non-case gripping condition thereof 
and a case gripping condition thereof. 
A method of unpacking a tobacco case comprising a 
tobacco bale contained within a packing box, in which 

method the upper flaps of said box are folded back to 
the sides of said box, said case is disposed above 

support means of a decasing unit and below transfer 
means of said decasing unit, said support means and 

said transfer means are brought to a condition 
wherein said case is held between said support means 

and said transfer means, said support means and said 
transfer means are rotated together so as to effect 

an inversion of said case, case gripping means is 
brought into a condition wherein said gripping means 

grips said box, after which said gripping means is  

 
moved upwardly so as to effect removal of said box 

from said bale, whereupon said bale is transferred on 
said transfer means and is removed from said unit.
