<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lubricant suitable for use in
industrial forming processes. It is particularly concerned with, but not
limited to, a lubricant suitable for use in an industrial forming process
for the production of seamless metal tubing known as cold pilgering.
For convenience, therefore, the invention will be more specifically
described below with reference to the cold pilgering process.Cold pilgering refers to the production of tubing from thick-walled
"shells" or "hollows" and involves a cold forging action between
an internal mandrel and a pair of specially profiled rolls which act as a
die.The cold pilgering process is particularly useful for
producing tubing from materials which easily work harden during
deformation, such as stainless steels and alloys of zirconium and
titanium and which are difficult or impossible to reduce by any other
means. Also, a much higher reduction in cross sectional area is
achievable by subjecting these materials to cold pilgering than is
possible by conventional methods such as tube drawing. Often 90% or
greater levels of reduction can be achieved by a single pass in the cold
pilgering process.The specially profiled rolls not only rotate during the
operation but move along the longitudinal axis of the tubing offering a
gradually decreasing aperture and progressively reducing the tubing
diameter. The internal dimensions of the tubing are controlled by the
tapered mandrel which supports the inside diameter of the tubing
during its passage through the rolls. After each stroke, when the rolls
have returned to their original position, the "shell" or "hollow" is twisted
(i.e. rotated), normally through approximately 60 degrees, and advanced
again. The "shells" or "hollows" used in the cold pilgering process
are normally produced by a hot extrusion process. For reasons
principally of manufacturing economy it is normal to extrude a
relatively small range of size i.e. diameters. Further intermediate sizes
are then made from this small range by cold pilgering. It will be
appreciated that considerable heat and pressure are generated during
the pilgering process and so excellent lubrication is essential.Two lubricants are normally used in the cold pilgering
process, an internal lubricant between the mandrel and the tubing
being drawn over it and an external one on the outside of the tubing,
i.e. between it and the walls of the rolls. Often the same product can be
used as both the internal and external lubricant in applications where
small reductions of cross-sectional
