<ABSTRACT>
A quercetin-containing colorant which has as an 
effective component a quercetin included by cyclodextrin. 

Effective use thereof as a colorant is possible by imparting 
thereto resistance against light, heat and chemicals to 

quercetin which is a flavonoid yellow substance. The 
colorant may be added to various food products for use of 

quercetin as a stable coloring matter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a quercetin-containing 
colorant, and specifically it relates to a quercetin-containing 
colorant which has been stabilized by forming an inclusion 
complex with cyclodextrin. Quercetin is a yellow substance 
contained in plants such as Japanese pagoda, onion and 
the like, and according to the present invention it is 
stabilized for use as a colorant. A method has been proposed for using quercetin in food 
preservation, for the improvement of solubility and as an 
antioxidant, by its inclusion complex with cyclodextrin (Japanese 
Patent Publication No.Hei 2-268643), but no method has been heretofore 
known for the use of quercetin/cyclodextrin inclusion complexes 
as pigments. Quercetin is alkali-soluble, but at pHs lower than neutral 
it becomes poorly soluble and its color changes considerably. Quercetin is an aglycon of rutin and quercitrin, and it 
is widely distributed among plants, imparting a bright yellow 
color thereto under alkaline conditions. However, quercetin  
 
is unstable under light and heat, and therefore it is almost 
never used as a colorant. An object of the present invention is to impart to 
quercetin resistance against light, heat and chemicals, thus 
providing a method for its use as a colorant. Fig. 1 is a graph showing the results of a light 
fastness test against fluorescent light. Fig. 2 is a graph showing the results of a light 
fastness test against ultraviolet light. Fig. 3 is a graph showing the results of a light 
fastness test against ultraviolet light after thermal 
treatment. The present invention relates to a quercetin-containing 
colorant having as an effective component a quercetin included 
by cyclodextrin. The quercetin to be used may be, in addition to crude 
and purified products obtained by extraction from the above 
mentioned plants, commercially available products (for 
example, products of Tokyo Kasei, Inc.). Also, cyclodextrin (hereunder abbreviated to "CD") is a 
cyclic oligosaccharide with a polymerization degree of 6-8 which 
is obtained by allowing cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, 
EC 2.4.1.19) to act on starch or a hydrolysate thereof, and  
 
specific examples thereof include α-, β- and γ-CD. According 
to the present invention, β-CD is particularly suitable. A quercetin-containing colorant according to the present 
invention may be obtained in the following manner. First, 1-2 parts by weight of quercetin which has been 
dissolved in an organic solvent such as ethanol, is added to 
10 parts by weight of CD
