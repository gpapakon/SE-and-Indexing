<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a dis-azo pigment having a 
low content of aromatic amine which process comprises reacting 

a solution of a tetrazonium salt of benzidine with a slurry of 
acetoacetanilide of which the amount is stoichiometrically 

excess relative to an amount of said tetrazonium salt, to 
prepare a dis-azo pigment slurry, and adding a halogen to the 

dis-azo pigment slurry to treat the acetoacetanilide in said 
slurry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of a dis-azo pigment excellent in sanitary 
condition and a dis-azo pigment produced by said process. A dis-azo pigment is produced by a coupling 
reaction of a solution of a tetrazonium salt of benzidine 
(including benzidine derivative) and a coupler solution of 
acetoacetanilide (including acetoacetanilide derivatives). 
The tetrazonium salt of benzidine (to be sometimes referred 
to as "tetrazo component" hereinafter) is chemically 
unstable and easily undergoes decomposition or condensation, 
and the tetrazonium salt consequently deteriorates the 
quality of the dis-azo pigment as a coloring material. For 
preventing the formation of a free tetrazo component, 
generally, the coupling reaction is carried out in the 
presence of the coupler in an amount which is 
stoichiometrically excessive to some extent. As a result, 
the pigment contains a residual coupler. The residual 
coupler is partly decomposed to form aromatic amines when a 
pigment slurry is heat-treated or when a pigment cake is 
dried. It is considered that, when the pigment is used as 
coloring material, the residual coupler and the aromatic 
amines are undesirable in view of sanitation. For reducing the residual coupler, generally, an 
alkali is added to the pigment slurry to dissolve 
acetoacetanilides in the coupler solution, and an excess 
coupler is removed together with a filtrate when the pigment 
is filtered. However, excess acetoacetanilides tend to be  
 
absorbed and stored in pigment particles, and it has been 
difficult to remove this residual coupler. Therefore, there are worldwide increasing demands 
for dis-azo pigments free of aromatic amines, while 
dis-azo pigments commercially available now are not 
necessarily satisfactory. For example, many products 
available as C.I. Pigment Yellow 83 have a 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroaniline 
content of 300 to 1,000 ppm, and in fact, some 
products have a 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroaniline content of 
more than 5,000 ppm. Further, as described above, the tetrazo component 
and the coupler component are allowed to react in 
stoichiometrically nearly equal amounts, there is obtained a 
dis-azo pigment containing almost no residual aromatic 
amine. However, there has been a problem in that a 
decomposition product derived from the tetrazo component 
makes the pigment hue cloudy to decrease the pigment product 
quality greatly. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a process for the production of a dis-azo pigment
