<ABSTRACT>
The griddle of this invention includes a temperature 
adjustment element (1) for adjusting a cooking temperature for a 

material (7) such as meat and vegetable, a thin plate (2) having a 
small heat capacity for heating the material, an adiabatic 

frame (3) for supporting the thin plate with an adiabatic 
structure, a plurality of heating elements (4) for heating the 

thin plate, a plurality of temperature sensors (5) for measuring 
temperatures of a plurality of positions on the thin plate, 

and a power distribution element (6) for determining power to be 
distributed to each of the heating elements based on the 

outputs from the temperature sensors and the cooking 
temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a griddle 
according to the preamble part of claim 1. A griddle has been used for enjoying grilled meat and 
steak among a small number of people, and is useful not only 
for enjoying the taste of the grilled meat and the like but 
also for the pleasures of a happy home. Figure 11 shows the configuration of a conventional 
griddle. The griddle comprises temperature adjustment means 
(not shown) for adjusting a cooking temperature for a material 
to be cooked such as meat and vegetables (hereinafter referred 
to as merely a material), an iron plate 101 with a thickness of 
several millimeters (mm), a heater 102 for heating the iron 
plate 101 through heat conduction, a heater container 103 for 
accommodating the heater 102, a temperature sensor 104 for 
measuring the temperature around the center of the iron plate 
101, and control means (not shown) for controlling the 
temperature of the iron plate 101 so as to be maintained at the  
 
cooking temperature by using the heater 102 and the temperature 
sensor 104. In such a conventional griddle, the iron plate 101 is 
subjected to auxiliary heating for a while to achieve a desired 
cooking temperature. Then, a material is placed around the 
center of the iron plate 101 to be grilled. 
Since the material is cool at this point, the temperature of 
the iron plate 101 can be decreased. The iron plate 101 and 
the heater container 103 of the conventional griddle, however, 
have a large heat capacity, and hence the temperature of the 
ironplate 101 is prevented from being largely decreased. Because of the change of society such as the increasing 
number of a dual-income family and the old, and the trend 
for pursuing a real stuff, cooking utensils are now required 
to satisfy the following demands (a) through (d): 
(a) to require a shorter time for cooking; (b) to be compact and light; (c) to consume a small electric power; and (d) to serve real cuisine.  
The real cuisine cooked with a griddle herein indicates food 
that is generally cooked on a large and thick iron plate or 
a large hot pebble, the temperature of which is not 
decreased by placing a material. In the conventional griddle, the auxiliary heating of 
the iron plate 101 takes a long time (approximately 10  
 
minutes) because the iron plate 101 and the heater container 
103 have a large heat capacity. Further, the conventional 
griddle is disadvantageously heavy. In addition, even when the material is put on only a 
center part of the plate, the entire plate is
