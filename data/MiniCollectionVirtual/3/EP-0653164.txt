<ABSTRACT>
In order to separate the sticks (8.1-8.n) arriving in rows from a cutting device (3) for slabs (5) of deep-frozen food delivered transversely and lying flat, provision is made for the middle rows of sticks (8.2-8.n-1) to be pushed into guide channels (10.1-10.n) which diverge from one another, whilst the sticks (8.1, 8.n) of the two outer rows are transferred onto individual conveyor bands (11, 12) which are arranged at a lower level than the guide channels (10.1-10.n). Adjacent to the guide channels (10.1-10.n) and to the ends of the individual conveyor bands (11, 12) is a conveyor band (15) which rotates at the higher conveying speed and which ascends at least from the lower level of the individual conveyor bands (11, 12) to the higher level of the guide channels (10.1-10.n).
