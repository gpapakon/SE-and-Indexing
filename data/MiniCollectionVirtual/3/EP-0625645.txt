<ABSTRACT>
The closure valve comprises a passage body (10) consisting 
of a truncated portion (14) which is coupled at its extremity 

of smaller diameter to a cylindrical portion (15) whose free end 
is joined to the internal extremity of the rod (3) of the device 

(
D
), and which also consists of a closure body (12) coaxial with 
said rod (3) and freely sliding on said cylindrical portion (15). 

The axial orifice (20) of the closure body (12) has at its extremity 
facing the passage body (10) a closure seat (21) of progressively 

increasing amplitude and sized correspondingly to the 
closure seal (11) of the passage body (10). The configuration of 

the closure seat (21) and of the closure seal (11) cause the progressive closure of the valve (
VC
) when the rod (3) is actuated in a 
traction mode, thus enabling, during the closure, the passage of liquid fluid (
F
) between both half-chambers (
SC1
, 
SC2
) of the 
main body (1). Application to the motor vehicle industry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
hydraulic self-regulating device for
regulating the length of control cables.The known embodiments of hydraulic self-regulating
devices for compensation of variations of control cable
lengths are constituted, in general, by an essentially
cylindrical main hollow body containing a piston, a
liquid, a regulating rod attached at one end to the
corresponding end of the control cable and a regulating
spring which exerts a permanent pull on the control cable
by way of the regulating rod.Spanish patent P 9002014 discloses a hydraulic self-regulating
device in which the regulating rod extends out
from one end of the main body and is connected to the
corresponding end of the control cable and the other end
of the rod, which remains housed in the main body, is
attached to a piston comprising a check valve which may
have different embodiments. This piston defines in the
main body two half-chambers respectively located one on
each side of the piston.One embodiment of said check valve disclosed in Spanish
patent P 9002014 comprises a flow body, a stopper body
and an opening spring. The flow body is attached to the 
regulating rod and is provided with orifices forming a
communication between the two half-chambers defined in
the main body by the piston, the flow body also having a
perimetrical sealing gasket. The stopper body is
coaxially disposed around the regulating rod and may
slide in both directions so that, by means of a sealing
gasket, it may open or close the flow body orifices. And
the opening spring is permanently under compression and
is arranged coaxially around the regulating rod between
the flow body and the stopper body while bearing against
the respective opposed faces.In general, both the above described embodiment and the
remaining embodiments of the piston check valve disclosed
in Spanish patent P 9002014 suffer from the drawback of
being formed by a large number of expensive-to-make
components, which increases both the production costs and
the assembly costs of the valve and, consequently, of the
self-regulating device.With a view to providing a new check valve embodiment
which with a small number of components is capable of
providing a solution for the above described problems,
there is disclosed a check valve for hydraulic self-regulating
device pistons of new structure and very high
reliable operativeness.The
hydraulic self-regulating device of the invention is formed by the
following members:
an essentially cylindrical hollow main body having at
one end a cap which

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic self-regulating
device,

particularly for regulating the length of control cables, comprising:

an essentially cylindrical hollow main body (1) having
at one end (
A
) a cap (2) which may be provided with a
volumetric compensating device and at the other end (B),

which is closed, fixing means (5), said main body (1)
containing a liquid (
F
), a regulating rod (3) a piston (E) with a check valve (VC) and a
regulating spring (4);
the regulating rod (3), one end of which extends from the
main body (1) through the closed end (
B
) thereof and is
attached to the corresponding end of the control cable,

the length of which is to be permanently and
automatically regulated and the other end of which is

permanently housed inside the main body (1) and is
attached to the piston (
E
) having the check valve (
VC
);
the regulating spring (4) disposed coaxially around the
regulating rod (3) and being under permanent compression,

bearing at one end against the closed end (
B
) of the main
body (1) and at the other end against the inner end of

the regulating rod (3) on an annular shoulder (9);

characterized by a flow body
(10) and a stopper body (12) in which:


the flow body (10) is composed of a frustoconical
portion (14) and a cylindrical portion (15), the smaller

diameter end of the frustoconical portion (14) being
longitudinally connected to the said cylindrical portion

(15), the free end of which is firmly attached in
longitudinal alignment with the inner end of the

regulating rod (3), the frustoconical portion (14) being 
provided with a lateral coaxial groove (16) in which

there is housed a flexible gasket (11), being formed on
the front face and on the larger diameter base thereof with a

concave surface (17) and, around the perimeter, with a
plurality of guide projections (18) so dimensioned that

the flow body (10) may snugly slide against the inner
surface of the main body (1) and the liquid (
F
)
contained therein may flow freely through the free

passages (19) defined between each pair of guide
projections (18) and the inner surface of the main body

(1);
the stopper body (12) is essentially cylindrical and is
coaxially disposed around the cylindrical portion (15) of

the flow body (10), said stopper body (12) having an
axial bore (20) so dimensioned to allow it loosely to

slide on said cylindrical portion (15) of the flow body
(10) allowing the liquid (
F
) contained in the main
body (1) to flow through the passage (
p
) defined by the
flow (10) and stopper (12) bodies, said axial bore (20)

having at the end thereof opposite the flow body (10) a
seal seat (21) of progressively variable size dimensioned

to mate with the sealing gasket (11) of the flow body
(1), the stopper body (12) having a lateral coaxial

groove (22) in which there is housed a perimetrically
outwardly extending resilient packing (13) which, by

resilient reaction, permanently bears against the inner
surface of the main body (1) so as to prevent the liquid

(
F
) contained in said main body (1) from flowing
through the fit determined by the packing (13) between

the stopper body (12) and the inner surface of the main
body (1).
The hydraulic self-adjusting
device of claim 1, characterized in that the

progressively variable size seal seat (21) of the stopper 
body (12) has a tapering elliptical form in the direction

of movement of the flow body (10) during closing of the
valve (
VC
) and in that the passage body (10) sealing
gasket (11) is of circular cross-section.
