<ABSTRACT>
A metallic contact (3, 4) is formed by etching of a metallic film locally protected by a blob of photosensitive resin (2). Then this resin is made to flow in the presence of vapours of a solvent of the latter, in order to form a protection blob of wider extent (2, 5). This latter blob makes it possible to carry out etching of the semiconductur substrate (1) with self-alignment of the relief thus formed with respect to the metallic contact. The resin remains photosensitive in order to allow subsequent etching. The invention applies especially to fabrication of avalanche photodiodes.

A method of forming a metal contact on a projection on a 
semiconductor substrate, in which: 


a) a metal film (3, 4) is deposited on the semiconductor 
substrate (1), and then a spot of photosensitive resin (2) is 

deposited on a zone of the substrate that is to be protected; 
b) the metal film around the zone protected by the spot of 
photosensitive resin is etched; 
c) the photosensitive resin is caused to flow around the 
protected zone so as to come into contact with the semiconductor 

substrate, the photosensitive resin being caused to flow by passing 
it for a short period of time in contact with vapor of a solvent for 

the resin; and 
d) the semiconductor substrate is subjected to etching all 
around the zone protected by the spot of photosensitive resin, in 

such a manner as to form said projection. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the metal 
contact is placed for a short period of time in an enclosure under an 

atmosphere saturated with vapor of the solvent. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
etching of the metal film during step 
b
 is continued until the 
remaining edge of said film (3, 4) is set back relative to the edge 

of the spot of photosensitive resin (2). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that an opening is formed in the metal film (3, 4) in the zone 

protected by the spot of photosensitive resin by placing over the 
spot a mask (6) defining the opening (7) to be made, by subjecting 

the photosensitive resin to radiation through said mask, and by 
performing a selective ablation treatment to remove the resin in the 

opening defined in this way, and then by etching the metal underlying 
said opening.
