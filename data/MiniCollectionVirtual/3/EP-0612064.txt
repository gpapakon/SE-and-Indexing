<ABSTRACT>
An optical pickup apparatus for reproducing 
information from an optical recording medium such as a 

compact disc, comprises a laser device (1), one or 
more diffraction devices (2,3) and a photodetector (7) 

receiving a laser beam diffracted by the diffraction 
device (3). The surfaces of the diffraction device 

(3) are provided with an antireflection coating 
(8a,8b). When the apparatus is used for the 

three-beam method, the two photodetecting areas 
(7a,7b) in the photodetector for producing the 

tracking error signal are different in size or in the 
positional relation with the laser device (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical pickup 
apparatus which is useful in an optical information 
reproducing system such as a compact disc player and a 
video disc player. In an optical information reproducing system 
such as a compact disc player or the like, an optical 
pickup apparatus is employed to reproduce information 
from a recording medium, e.g. a so-called compact disc. 
It has been proposed to use a diffraction device in 
such an optical pickup apparatus, thereby reducing the 
number of components of the optical pickup apparatus. Figure 6 shows a conventional optical pickup 
apparatus having a diffraction device. The optical 
pickup apparatus of Fig. 6 which obtains optical 
signals from a recording medium 16 comprises a 
semiconductor laser device 11 for emitting a laser 
beam, a diffraction device 13, a collimating lens 14, 
an object lens 15, and an photodetector 17. The 
photodetector 17 is disposed at the side of the 
semiconductor laser device 11. A laser beam emitted from the semiconductor 
laser device 11 passes the diffraction device 13 and 
the collimating lens 14, and is then focused on the 
recording medium 16 by the object lens 15. The light 
beam reflected from the recording medium 16 passes 
again through the object lens 15 and the collimating  
 
lens 14,and then enters the diffraction device 13 to 
be diffracted. The first-order diffraction beam enters 
the photodetector 17 which converts optical signals 
incident thereon to an information signal, a focus 
error signal and a tracking error signal. When the laser light beam emitted from the 
laser device 11 passes the diffraction device 13, the 
major part of the laser light beam propagates in the 
diffraction device as indicated by the arrows A4, and a 
part of the laser light beam is reflected at the 
surface 13a of the diffraction device 13 as indicated 
by the arrows A3. Then, a part of the laser light beam 
is reflected at the other surface 13b of the 
diffraction device 13 as indicated by the arrows A2. 
The reflected light beams A2 and A3 also enter the 
photodetector 17. In this way, the photodetector 17 receives 
the reflected light beams A2 and A3 in addition to the 
light beam reflected from the recording medium 16, 
resulting in that the output signals of the 
photodetector 17 are offset or biased. When only the reflected light beam A2 or A3 
is to be considered, the degree of the offset produced 
in the output signals of the photodetector 17 may 
remain within an acceptable range because the amounts 
of the
