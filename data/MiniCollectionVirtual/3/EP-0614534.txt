<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radar systems
and more particularly to improved accuracy in target
azimuth information during roll and/or pitch of a
radar system antenna with respect to a reference.Radar systems are typically provided with a
mechanical stabilization system for controlling the
angular position of the radar system antenna to
thereby maintain a constant reference frame for the
antenna with respect to a reference axis or plane,
e.g., ground. Such mechanical stabilization is
usually accomplished using servomechanisms, e.g.,
gimbal and drive systems. Position or rate gyros are
typically used to sense vehicle pitch and roll, and
issue position signals directly to the stabilization
system to maintain the desired antenna reference.A problem with using gimbal and drive systems
for mechanical antenna stabilization is that they add
significant weight to the radar system, which is of
particular concern in radars intended for use on
aircraft. Additionally, because of complexities
associated with stabilization systems, they are prone
to frequent repair and maintenance. Another problem
is that servomechanisms required for roll and pitch
stabilization increase the overall size of an antenna
assembly with the result that within a given
installation space, the area for the radiating
portion of the antenna, and consequently the antenna 
gain and resolution, must be reduced.A radar antenna that is rotational only about a vertical or yaw axis
and not provided with roll and pitch stabilization, i.e., having a fixed
platform, is referred to as being "strapped down". A strapped down
antenna eliminates weight penalties and complexities associated with
mechanical stabilization systems, and also reduces the space requirement
for a given antenna. However, any roll and/or pitch experienced by a
vehicle carrying the antenna is translated directly to the antenna.Movement of the antenna in roll and pitch may look to the radar system
like movement of the target, and therefore, fixed platform antennas are
incapable of providing accurate target position information during roll
and/or pitch of the antenna, thereby preventing the radar tracking system
from maintaining target acquisition and correlation accuracy during
antenna roll and/or pitch.The azimuth error suffered by radars which are not roll and pitch
stabilized manifests itself as a "blurred" or "smeared" representation of the
target on a radar display. Additionally, when roll or pitch movement of the
radar antenna is rapid or of a large magnitude, the target may
