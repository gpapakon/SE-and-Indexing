<ABSTRACT>
A dual ink jet head (60) has an actuator (61) formed from a 
piezoelectric material that has side A and side B formed with 

a plurality of ink channels in total. To eject ink droplets 
from the nozzles (12) in both side A and side B of the actuator 

using a single power source, electrode pairs (8) for selected ink 
channels in side A are connected to the single power source 

and the remaining electrode pairs for non-selected ink 
channels in side A are disconnected from the single power 

source, and electrode pairs for selected ink channels in side 
B are disconnected from the single power source and the 

remaining electrode pairs for non-selected ink channels in 
side B are connected to the single power source. By so 

driving the actuator, ink droplets are ejected from the 
nozzles corresponding to the selected electrode pairs in both 

side A and side B.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for driving
an ink jet head to eject ink from the ink jet head.A conventional ink jet head and a driver for driving
the head are constructed as will be described below.Fig. 1 shows structure of an ink jet head 1. The ink
jet head 1 includes a piezoelectric ceramic plate 2, a cover
plate 10, a nozzle plate 14, and a substrate 41.The piezoelectric ceramic plate 2 is polarized in the
direction indicated by arrow 5. A certain number n of
grooves 3 are cut into the piezoelectric ceramic plate 2 in
a direction parallel to the direction of polarization. The
depth of the grooves 3 becomes gradually shallower with
increasing closeness to the end 15 of the piezoelectric
ceramic plate 2. Shallow grooves 7 are formed adjacent to
the end 15. Metal electrodes 8 are formed to the upper half
of both side surfaces of each groove 3 using sputtering or
some other technique. Metal electrodes 9 are formed to the
side surfaces and the floor of each shallow groove 7. The
metal electrodes 9 are for providing electrical connection
between the metal electrodes 8 formed at either side of each
groove 3.The cover plate 10 is formed from a ceramic or resin
material. An ink introduction port 16 and a manifold 18 are
formed in the cover plate 10 by cutting or grinding. Using
an epoxy type adhesive 20 (refer to Fig. 3), the surface of
the piezoelectric ceramic plate 2 with the grooves 3 formed
therein is adhered to the surface of the cover plate 10 with
the manifold 18 formed therein. As a result, the tops of the
grooves 3 are covered to produce ink chambers 4 (refer to
Fig. 3). The ink chambers 4 are a plurality of ink channels
formed at a uniform pitch across the width of the head 1.
Ink fills all of the ink chambers 4.A nozzle plate 14 formed from plastic is provided
with nozzles 12 in the same pitch as the pitch of the ink
chambers 4. The nozzle plate 14 is adhered to the ends of 
the piezoelectric ceramic plate 2 and the cover plate 10 so
that each nozzle 12 is aligned with an ink chamber 4.A substrate 41 is adhered using an epoxy type
adhesive to the side of the piezoelectric ceramic plate 2
opposite the side with the grooves 3 formed therein. Conductor
layer patterns 42 are formed to the substrate 41 at
positions corresponding to the positions of the ink chambers
4. Each conductor layer pattern 42 is connected to a corresponding
metal electrode 9 at the floor of each shallow
groove 7 by conductor wires 43 using well-known wire bonding
techniques.Fig. 2 shows connection of the ink jet
