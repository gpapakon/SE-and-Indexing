<ABSTRACT>
In a device for the contactless sealing of interspaces at different pressures with the aid of sealing fins which are arranged in stages, a better sealing effect is achieved by the fact that two groups of sealing fins (2, 3) pointing in opposite directions are provided, one (2) of these groups belonging to a rotating part (B) and the other group (3) belonging to a fixed part (A). The sealing fins (2) of the first group are offset axially in such a way relative to the sealing fins (3) of the second group that, allowing for predetermined tolerances and temperature-related axial displacements, the axial gap (4) formed between two opposing sealing fins (2, 3) in the region of the transition from one stage (1a) to the next stage (1b) is minimised.
