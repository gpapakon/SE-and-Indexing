<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for preparing and renovating ancient walls (2, 2.1), specially those made of stone (8), brick, mortar (9) or the like. The wall (2, 2.1) is laterally sealed and is irrigated with water from the top down until the mortar (9) is at least partially softened. Subsequently, a binding agent is applied to the wall (2), specially to the crown (7) thereof.

Method of preparing and renovating ancient walls (2, 2.1) by means of mortar (9), in particular comprising stones (8), bricks and the like,
characterized in
that
 the wall (2, 2.1) is first sealed laterally and then loaded from above with water until the mortar (9) has become at least partially sodden, wherein a binding agent is then applied onto the wall (2), in particular onto a crest (7) of the wall.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 before a possibly inclined wall (2, 2.1) is set into a vertical position, said wall is sealed laterally and then drenched with water from above.
Method according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the inclined wall (2.1) after being drenched with water is set upright and then loaded with binding agent from above.
Method according to at least one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
, after binding agent has been supplied, the wall (2, 2.1) is hardened in an adjacent lining (1, 1.2) and then the lining is removed.
Method according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 to prepare and/or set the inclined wall (2, 2.1) upright a lateral lining (1, 1.2) is used, which is loaded with pressure against the wall (2, 2.1).
Method according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 for lateral sealing and renovation a sealing element (5.1, 5.2), in particular a foil, and/or then a buffer element (6.1, 6.2) is inserted between the wall (2, 2.1) and the lateral lining (1, 1.2).
Device for preparing and renovating ancient walls (2, 2.1) by means of mortar (9), in particular comprising stones (8), bricks and the like, comprising a lining (1.1, 1.2) that is capable of laterally surrounding the wall (2, 2.1), 
characterized by
 a buffer element (6.1, 6.2) that is to be disposed between wall and lining.
Device according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 a buffer element (6.1, 6.2) and a sealing element (5.1, 5.2) are disposed between wall (2, 2.1) and lining (1.1, 1.2).
Device according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterized in that
 a sealing element (5.1, 5.2) is inserted between wall (2, 2.1) and lining (1.1, 1.2).
Device according to at least one of claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the sealing element (5.1, 5.2), in particular foil and/or the buffer element (6.1, 6.2) are/is elastic and/or impervious to liquid.
