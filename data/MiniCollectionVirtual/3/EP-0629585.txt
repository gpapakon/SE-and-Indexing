<ABSTRACT>
A process of inhibiting oxalate scale formation in aqueous 
systems is disclosed. A preferred class of scale inhibitors 

is represented by polyamino hexamethylene phosphonates. 
These phosphonate inhibitors can be used in levels of from 

0.05 ppm to 300 ppm (of the aqueous solution) at pH in the 
near neutral to preferably alkaline medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process of inhibiting scale 
formation and deposition, and more particularly to a method 
of inhibiting the formation of scale in aqueous systems which 
are primarily alkaline and contain oxalates. Deposits of sparingly soluble calcium oxalate occur in 
industries and processes such as paper manufacture 
(especially in the pulping process), sugar beet processing, 
sugar clarification and whisky distillation. Paper making processes are a major industry sector 
suffering from oxalate scaling because large volumes of water 
rich in calcium are used and because the wood, i;e. the basic 
raw material, is a natural source of oxalic acid (see 
"Handbook of Industrial Water Conditioning", sixth edition, 
third printing, Betz Laboratories Inc., Trevose, 
Pennsylvania 19047, USA). The recirculation of process 
waters increases the concentration of oxalate and enhances 
further the tendency towards precipitation. The undesirable effects of the deposition of oxalate 
scale are well documented in the literature-see J.A.Glazer-"Overview 
of Deposit Control", Tappi J., page 72 July 1991. Compounds which act as scale inhibitors, or mixtures of 
such compounds, do so by inhibiting the growth of crystals, 
thereby effecting a reduction in the formation of scale. 
Crystalline deposits can be effectively controlled by 
introducing an appropriate impurity into the crystal lattice. 
Such an impurity prevents further growth of the crystal and 
reduces or eliminates the scale formation. Phosphonates, 
polyphosphates and polymeric electrolytes are typically used 
for this purpose.  USP 4575425 describes a scale inhibiting formulation 
comprising water soluble phosphate, phosphonate or 
phosphinate and a water soluble polyelectrolyte. USP 4804476 describes a scale inhibiting mixture 
comprising water soluble phosphates and polycarboxylates to 
inhibit the deposition of calcium oxalate in paper mills. GB 2248830 and EP-A-0479462 describe methods useful in 
the oil industry for inhibiting the formation of scale in 
water having a high barium content and a low pH comprising 
the addition of an aqueous solution of defined 
polyaminomethylene phosphonates to the water to be treated. Other substances used as typical scale inhibitors 
include sulphonated ethoxylated hydrocarbons, polyacrylates, 
and organic polyphosphonic acids. The "other" scale 
inhibitors are chemically different from the phosphonate 
compounds in accordance with Claim 1 and can be represented 
by all compounds which are known to exhibit
