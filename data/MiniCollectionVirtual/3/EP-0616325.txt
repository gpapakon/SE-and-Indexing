<ABSTRACT>
A cassette (1) having a recording medium contained therein for use with a 
recording/reproducing apparatus. The cassette (1) includes a storage device for storing 

information pertaining to the recording medium and/or the cassette (1); a plurality of 
terminals (42) coupled to the storage device and adapted to be coupled to the 

recording/reproducing apparatus when the cassette (1) is being used therewith so as to 
transfer the stored information to the recording/reproducing apparatus; and an 

accidental-erasure prevention switch member (43) located in close proximity to the 
terminals (42) for inhibiting recording of an information signal onto the recording 

medium and inhibiting erasing of a previously recorded information signal from the 
recording medium. At least one hole (6) and a window (7) are provided in the cassette 

so as to provide access to the terminals (42) and the accidental-erasure prevention 

switch member (43). Such at least one hole (6) and window (7) may be arranged so as 
to provide a relatively large area (8) for fastening a label. The recording/reproducing 

apparatus includes a connector which is coupled to the terminals (42) when the cassette 
(1) is inserted and mounted in the recording/reproducing apparatus and adapted to 

receive the information from the storage device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cassette
for use with the
recording/reproducing device and having a plurality of terminals
for transferring informational data to the recording/reproducing
apparatus and having a switch for inhibiting the recording of
signal information onto or erasure of signal information from the
recording medium.Typically, cassettes or cartridges are utilized to hold
a recording medium, such as a magnetic tape. Such cassettes are
used with recording/reproducing devices so as to record
information onto and/or reproduce recorded information from the
recording medium.It may be desirable to supply or transmit informational
data pertaining to the cassette to the recording/reproducing
device, such as data pertaining to the type of recording medium
contained within the cassette or data indicating whether
information may be recorded onto or erased from the recording
medium. Such cassette informational data would enable the
recording/reproducing device to properly perform desired
operations. Further, it may also be desirable to automatically
supply the cassette informational data to the
recording/reproducing device upon the installation of the
cassette into the recording/reproducing device.Furthermore, it may still further be desirable to
enable the automatic supply of cassette informational data to the
recording/reproducing device upon the installation of the
cassette into the recording/reproducing device such that the
height of the recording/reproducing device is not affected.The international publication WO 93/14501 published on
July 22, 1991 (EP-A-0620945) and thus forming prior art according to
Art. 54(3) and (4) EPC describes a tape cassette having a
chip card storage medium attached thereto and including a
recording inhibiting means located in proximity thereto. The
recording inhibiting means, however, is of a conventional
type and requires breaking out a lug. So the recording
prohibiting means can only be operated once.European patent application EP 0 476 445 A2 describes a
conventional audio tape cassette further having a semi-conductor
memory with contact terminals providing external
access to the semi-conductor memory.The international application WO 91/05348 relates to a
magnetic tape cartridge having a slidable write-enable/write-protect
member carrying a magnet. The tape
recording/reproducing device comprises magnetic field
sensing means for detecting the write-protect/write-enable
member and its position. The recording/reproducing device
thus can detect the position of the
