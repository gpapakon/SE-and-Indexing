<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of [[4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl]hydrazono]propanedinitrile
(I) or its
enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in the manufacture
of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of myocardial ischemia.[(4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl]hydrazono]propanedinitrile
(I) has been earlier described in European patent application
EP 383449. It has been shown that compound (I) may be potent in the
treatment of congestive heart failure. The optically pure enantiomers of this
compound has previously been described in the patent application
WO 912135. It has now been revealed that compound (I) and its optically
active enantiomers also have significant anti-ischemic properties.The method for the preparation of compound (I) and the resolution of its
optically active (-) and (+) enantiomers are described in the patent
applications mentioned above. Salts of these compounds may be prepared by
known methods. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful as active
medicaments, however, preferred salts are the salts with alkali or alkaline
earth metals.In EP 383449 it was shown that compound (I) has significant calcium
dependent binding to troponin and is a potent inhibitor of PDE III enzyme.
Like other PDE III inhibitors, such as pimobendan and milrinone, compound
(I) increases contractility of the cardiac muscle and produces vasodilatation
and has therefore utility in the treatment of congestive heart failure. The anti-ischemic
utility of positive inotropic compound (I) which is a potent PDE III
inhibitor was unexpected because arrhythmic effects have often been
observed in connection with PDE III inhibitors. We have found that, unlike
pimobendan or milrinone, compound (I) can decrease calcium influx. This
may play some role in the observed new effect of compound (I) and its
enantiomers.The anti-ischemic compound according to the invention is formulated
into dosage forms using the principles known in the art. It is given to
mammalian organisms, i.e., humans, a patient as such or in combination with
suitable pharmaceutical excipients in the form of tablets, dragees, capsules, 
suppositories, emulsions, suspensions or solutions whereby the contents of
the active compound is in the formulation from about 0.5 to 100 % per weight.
In general, the compound of the invention may be administered to man in oral
doses ranging from about 1 to 100 mg per day once a day or divided into
several doses. Choosing suitable
