<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for mounting a connector 
assembly (10) to a mounting surface (24) of an electrical 

apparatus (12) through the use of a vacuum-suction nozzle. 
The connector assembly includes a dielectric housing (14) 

adapted to be positioned adjacent the mounting surface. 
The housing has a plurality of terminal-receiving through 

passages (20). A plurality of electrical terminals (28) 
are mounted in the passages and include tail portions (30) 

projecting from first open ends of the through passages for 
interconnection to circuitry (32) of the electrical 

apparatus. A film (40) is secured to the housing covering 
second open ends of at least some of the through passages 

to provide a smooth surface area (42) for engagement by the 
vacuum-suction nozzle for manipulating and positioning the 

connector assembly. Preferably, the film has an adhesive 
on one side (44) thereof for securing to the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a system for 
manipulating and positioning a connector assembly through 
the use of a vacuum-suction nozzle. With the continuing trend toward compact 
electronic apparatus, there is an ever-increasing demand 
for miniaturized interconnection systems between the 
electronic components of the apparatus. An example is in 
computer apparatus wherein there is a constant demand to 
reduce the thickness or height parameters of the electronic 
components. With the components mounted on a printed 
circuit board, the thickness or height parameters relate to 
the distance above the board in which desired 
interconnections are made and which constantly are being 
miniaturized. One approach to such miniaturization is to 
eliminate bulky electrical connector housings and, instead, 
to use relatively thin connectors or connector blocks for 
locating and/or terminating tail portions of terminals 
relative to circuit traces on the printed circuit board. 
The tails may be soldered to circuit traces on the board or 
in the holes, and a complementary connector assembly may be 
mounted directly to the connector block or interconnected 
thereto by terminal pins extending through the holes in the 
printed circuit board from the opposite side of the board.  Problems continue to be encountered in handling 
such connector assemblies for mounting to a mounting 
surface of an electrical apparatus, such as positioning the 
connector assembly on the printed circuit board. As is 
known, a solder reflow process often is used to secure 
electrical connectors to printed circuit boards. It has 
become expedient to use a vacuum-suction nozzle for 
handling the electrical connector to position the connector 
on the circuit board prior to the solder reflow process. 
Specifically, an electrical connector is secured by a 
vacuum-suction nozzle, and the electrical connector is 
manipulated in position and brought to a selected position 
on the printed circuit board by the vacuum-suction nozzle. 
The connector then is released by the nozzle by stopping 
application of negative pressure thereto. Gas then is 
released inside the soldering reflow vessel, or infrared 
rays are radiated therein until the solder applied to 
selected conductors on the printed circuit board has been 
melted, thereby soldering the selected conductors to solder 
tails of the electrical connector. Such a system involving the use of a vacuum-suction 
nozzle is quite effective if the
