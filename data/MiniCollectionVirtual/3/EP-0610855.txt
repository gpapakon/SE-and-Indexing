<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector includes a housing (20) having 
a plurality of cavities (22) receiving a plurality of 

terminals (40) therein respectively and a slide wall having 
an opening communicating to the terminal receiving cavities 

(22) and a retainer (30). The retainer (30) includes a body 
(31) engaged with the housing (20) and moved in parallel 

with it and lock strips (32) each coupled to the body (31) 
and bendable. Each lock strip (32) is engaged with the 

housing (20) through a guide and moving toward and away from 
the housing (20) with the parallel movement of the body 

(31). Each lock strip (32) has protrusions (33) disposed to 
face the opening of the housing. The protrusions (33) are 

moved into and out of the opening of the housing (20) when 
each lock strip (32) is moved toward and away from the 

housing (20). The lock strips (32) engage the terminals 
(40) received in the cavities (22) respectively when moved 

into the opening of the housing (20) such that the terminals 
(40) are held in position by the retainer (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector having
cavities receiving terminals each of which has one end
connected to a lead, and more particularly to such a connector
employing a retainer providing double engagement for
the terminals received in the cavities so that the terminals
can be held in position therein.FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate a conventional electrical connector
employing the retainer providing double engagement
for the terminals. FIGS. 9 and 10 illustrate another conventional
connector employing such a retainer.Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, the connector comprises a
housing 1 with cylindrical cavities la receiving respective
terminals 2. Each cavity la has an open rear end through
which the terminal 2 is inserted. A cap-shaped retainer 3
is fitted on an outer periphery of the rear end of the housing
1. The retainer 3 has terminal insertion apertures 3a
corresponding to the respective rear openings of the cavities
la. Each terminal insertion aperture 3a has a protrusion
3b formed on the upper edge of the inner periphery
thereof so that it protrudes toward the interior of the
corresponding cavity la. When the retainer 3 is completely
fitted on the housing 1 as shown in FIG. 8, each protrusion
3b enters into the corresponding cavity la to collide with
the rear end of the terminal 2. The state of the housing 1
and the retainer 3 as shown in FIG. 8 will be referred to
as "full engagement."The retainer 3 can be engaged with the housing 1 before
the full engagement state, assuming a position away upwardly
from its position in the full engagement state, as shown
in FIG. 7. In this position away upwardly from that in the
full engagement state, each protrusion 3a is out of the
corresponding cavity la and away upwardly therefrom. Accordingly,
the protrusions 3a do not interrupt the terminal 2 
being inserted into the cavities la respectively. The state
of the housing 1 and the retainer 3 as shown in FIG. 7 will
be referred to as "preliminary engagement."In assembly of the above-described connector, the terminals
2 are inserted into the cavities la from the terminal
insertion apertures 3a respectively with the housing 1
and the retainer 3 in the state of preliminary engagement.
Forced down in the direction of arrow A in the preliminary
engagement state as shown in FIG. 8, the retainer 3 is
thrust in the direction of arrow B in FIG. 8. Thus,
two-stage operation is necessitated in order that the retainer
3 is engaged with the housing 1 in the full engagement
state, that is, pushing the retainer 3 in

An electrical connector comprising:

a housing (20) having a plurality of cavities (22) receiving
a plurality of terminals (40) therein, wherein lock

arms (26) are arranged in the respective cavities (22), the
lock arms (26) engaging the terminals (40) in the cavities

(22) respectively to thereby hold the same in position, and
a retainer (30) engaged with the housing (20) and movable
between a preliminary engagement position and a full

engagement position, the retainer (30) having lock strips
(32) invading the respective cavities (22), the lock strips

(32) engaging the terminals (40) in the cavities (22) respectively
to thereby hold the same in position when the

retainer (30) assumes the full engagement position, the
lock strips (32) allowing insertion and pullout of the terminals

(40) when the retainer (30) assumes the preliminary
engagement position,

   characterized in that

the housing (20) has an opening (22a) communicating to
the terminal receiving cavities (22) and the retainer (30)

includes a body (31) engaged with the housing (20) and movable
toward and away to and from the housing (20) in parallel

with the same, wherein lock strips (32) are coupled to
the body (31) and bendable relative thereto, each lock

strip (32) being engaged with the housing (20) through
guide means (28, 35), said guide means (28, 35) guiding

said retainer (30) parallel to said housing (20) and drawing
