<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (100) and methods of focusing and to 
steering a group of electrons emitted from an electron 

source (112) to a shield (102). In a preferred 
embodiment, the apparatus (100) includes an electron 

source controlled by one or more voltages to emit 
electrons, a first electrode (114) adjacent to one side 

of the source (112), and a second electrode (108), 
insulated from the first electrode (114), adjacent to an 

opposite side of the source (112). The shield (102) has 
a shield voltage. The first (114) and the second (108) 

electrode have a first and a second voltage respectively 
to focus and steer a substantial portion of the emitted 

electrons towards the shield (102). One application of 
the present invention is in the area of flat panel 

displays with the shield (102) being a screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electron 
sources, and more particularly to focusing and steering 
electrons from the electron sources, such as field 
emitters. An easy-to-build flat panel display has been 
considered as the "Holy Grail" in electronics. Numerous 
researchers have been trying to invent such a display. One 
of the hurdles of the display is to easily and 
inexpensively focus and steer the electrons emitted from 
the electron sources to the screen of the display. Various devices have been used to focus and steer the 
emitted electrons. For example one method, described in 
EP-A-0614209, depends on layers of metallic grids hanging 
directly above the sources. Displays with these grids are 
expensive and difficult to make reliably. An alternative 
method employing several electrodes in different planes was 
disclosed in US 3753022. Another method, known as the "switched anode" method, 
depends on positioning the screen of the display very close 
to the electron sources and then dynamically varying 
voltages on the screen to attract and to guide the 
electrons. To prevent voltage breakdown between the screen 
and the electron sources, the voltage difference between 
the screen and the sources should be low. With a 
significant portion of the electrons attracted to the gates 
controlling the sources and missing the screen, the power 
efficiency of the display is low. Also, the voltage on the 
screen typically limits the brightness of the display, and 
the potential difference between adjacent stripes on the 
screen limit the resolution of the display.  
 It should be apparent from the foregoing that there is 
still a need for apparatus and methods to efficiently focus and 
steer electrons in a flat panel display. The present invention provides such methods and apparatus 
as defined by claims 1 and 6. This invention defined does not need layers of metal grids 
hanging on top of the sources to focus and to steer the 
emitted electrons from the sources in the display. Those 
grids are not easy to build and are difficult to assemble. 
This invention also does not need to guide the emitted 
electrons by dynamically varying voltages on the screen, as 
in the switching anode method. The power efficiency, 
brightness and the resolution of a display by the switching 
anode method usually are low. In the present invention, 
images on the screen are expected to have a resolution 
better than 150 microns and to consume more than 90% of the 
total energy in the emitted electrons. The high power
