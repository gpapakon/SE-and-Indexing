<ABSTRACT>
Melt extrusion processes involving phosphite 
stabilized polyolefin compositions subject to solid 

by-product formation during melt extrusion are 
improved by the addition of a metal salt of a lactic 

acid to the composition. The processes involving the 
improved compositions exhibit reduced levels of 

screen pack plugging during fiber and film extrusion 
processes than that achieved with fatty acid salts, 

such as calcium stearate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a melt 
extrusion processes, and more particularly relates to 
melt extrusion processes for making polypropylene 
fibers or films. Processes for making polymeric fibers and films 
are known, see U.S. Patent Nos. Knox, U.S. 4156071, 
issued May 22, 1979, Frankfort et al, U.S. 4134882, 
issued January 16, 1979, Piazza et al., U.S.

2604667, issued July 29, 1952, all of which are 
incorporated herein by reference, and Great Britain 
Patent Nos. 903427, published August 15, 1962, 
1487843, published October 5, 1977 and 1574305, 
published September 3, 1986, all of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. Phosphites are 
known stabilization additives for polyolefins, see 
York, U.S. Patent 4305866, Lewis, U.S. Patent 
4403053, issued September 6, 1983 and Valdiserri et 
al, U.S. Patent 4302383, issued November 24, 1981, 
all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Polyolefin processors are attempting to process 
polymer at increasing temperatures and with increased 
shear and work on the polymer. They are also 
processing polymer which may contain polymerization  
 
catalyst residues. The total residual metal content 
has been decreasing in recent years but the catalyst 
residue may still be active. This combination of more abusive processing 
conditions and the possibility of catalyst residue 
still being active may lead to difficulties when 
trying to process the polymers. Catalyst "neutralizers" are well known in the 
art and are generally used in most formulations to 
inhibit corrosion of processing equipment resulting 
from catalyst residues. Typical examples would be: 
Ca, Zn, or Mg Stearates, Ca, Zn, or Mg oxides and 
synthetic hydrotalcite compositions such as a 
product manufactured and sold by Kyowa as DHT4A. 
Additionally products such as the Calcium Stearoyl 
Lactates and Calcium Lactates have been shown to be 
beneficial in catalyst neutralization as evidenced by 
reduced corrosion. In many of the high temperature melt processes 
such as fiber spinning and film manufacture, screen 
packs are utilized to remove small particles which 
may be in the polymer prior to the polymer passing 
through the small orifices used in fiber and film 
processes. With the higher processing 
temperature/high shear applications there is a 
tendency for some
