<ABSTRACT>
The attitude of a spinning spacecraft (20) whose 
spin axis is substantially in the plane of the orbit is 

controlled without the use of reaction control thrusters. A 
two-axis gimbal (24) on which a momentum wheel (26) is mounted 

is secured to a central body (21). Two actuators (40, 42) are 
used to selectively pivot the gimballed momentum wheel (26) 

about each gimbal axis (x, y) in order to apply a control moment 
to change the attitude state of the spacecraft (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention broadly relates to positioning of 
spacecraft and more particularly to attitude control. Attitude control of spin stabilized spacecraft has 
traditionally been accomplished by pulsed thrusters which 
provide spin phased moments. This works well when the 
operational spin axis is normal to the orbit plane. The 
payloads in some spacecraft, however, require a nadir pointing 
spin axis. In order to preclude continuous thrusting to 
maintain the orbital angular rate, momentum cancelling wheels 
hard mounted to the spacecraft are used to create a zero 
momentum system. When it is desired to slew the spin axis from 
one pointing direction to another, reaction control thrusters 
are used to create the starting and stopping moments. If solar 
radiation pressure creates undesired external moments, thrusters 
are also used to cancel such moments. While reaction control thrusters are necessary, it 
would be desirable to use them as little as possible. There is 
a limited amount of propellant available to fire the thrusters. 
The more that the thrusters must be fired, the less fuel 
available for later maneuvers. Further, there are inherent 
uncertainties involving a thruster on-time and sophisticated 
methods are required in order to compensate for these 
uncertainties.  The present invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for attitude control of a spinning spacecraft whose spin 
axis is substantially in the plane of the orbit without the use 
of reaction control thrusters. The attitude control system of the present invention 
includes a two-axis gimbal mounted to the central body of a 
spacecraft. The spacecraft has a center of momentum, CM, which 
acts as the origin for principal body axes x, y, and z, each of 
which is at a right angle to the other two. The spacecraft 
spins about the z-axis. The gimbal has a first portion pivoting 
about the x-axis and a second portion pivoting about the 
y-axis. A momentum wheel is secured to the gimbal. The control 
system includes at least two actuators, a first actuator 
disposed between the outer surface of the spacecraft and the 
first portion to apply a first control moment about the x-axis. 
A second actuator is disposed between the outer surface and the 
second portion to apply a second control moment about the 
y-axis. Together, these control moments are used to control the 
attitude of the satellite. In a preferred embodiment, the actuators are 
electromagnetic force generators. A satellite provided with such an attitude control 
system has a
