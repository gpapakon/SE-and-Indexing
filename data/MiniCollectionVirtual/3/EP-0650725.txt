<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
treatment of disease states. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to compositions and methods for 
stimulating intracellular glutathione levels. It is known that intracellular levels of glutathione 
can be important with respect to cell function and the 
overall well being of mammals. Reduced glutathione 
levels are found in many disease states, e.g., immune 
compromised patients and stressed patients. Additionally, it is known that glutathione provides 
many benefits in protecting cells against damage. For 
example, glutathione protects cells against the effects 
of free radicals and oxygen intermediates. Free radicals 
are molecules with an unpaired electron creating an 
unstable and highly reactive molecule. Oxygen free 
radicals are highly reactive with biological 
macromolecules, such as found in cell membranes and 
thereby can induce cell damage. A number of methods of treatment have been devised 
using the stimulation of intracellular glutathione 
levels. Such treatments have been proposed for a variety 
of disease states, including: reperfusion injury (see 
U.S. Patent No. 5,095,027); hepatic disease; adult 
respiratory distress syndrome; immune disorders; bone 
marrow hypoplasia; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; 
infertility; atherosclerosis; and latent viral 
infections.  Unfortunately, according to literature in the art, 
intracellular glutathione levels cannot be increased by 
merely attempting to load the cell with glutathione. 
See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,784,685 - "there are 
several reports on particular biological systems 
indicating that glutathione itself is not transported 
into cells" (column 2, lines 37-39). Glutathione is composed of three amino acids: 
glutamic acid; cysteine; and glycine. Although the 
administration to animals of amino acid precursors of 
glutathione may produce an increase in cellular 
glutathione, there is a limit to the effectiveness of 
this procedure. Concentrations of glutathione are dependent on the 
supply of cysteine. Cysteine can be derived from dietary 
protein and by transulfuration from methionine in the 
liver. Cysteine administration is not an ideal method 
for increasing intracellular glutathione concentrations. 
In this regard, cysteine is rapidly metabolized and is 
very toxic. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,434,158 
- "cysteine cannot be administered intravenously due to 
its toxic effects on the system" (column 2, lines 6-8). A number of compounds have been devised
