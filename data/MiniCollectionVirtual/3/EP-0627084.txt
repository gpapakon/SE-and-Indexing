<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
and method for measuring an unknown voltage, and is
applicable to voltage measurement techniques for use in
an electronic power meter.In electronic power meters it is necessary to
accurately measure a voltage that has a large amplitude
or at least a large average or RMS value. One
measurement approach is to divide the voltage with a
resistive voltage divider down to a range of values
that can be measured with a conventional voltage
measuring device, such as an analog-to-digital
converter (ADC). However, the accuracy of a measurement
obtained by the conventional method is limited by the
uncertainty in the values of the resistances of the
voltage divider. The accuracy of the resistance values
may be diminished by a number of factors, including
temperature affects and the effects of being subjected
to over-voltage conditions. Moreover, the initial
accuracy of the resistance values may be less than
ideal.An apparatus and method according to the
pre-characterising part of claims 1 and 12 is known
from US Patent Specification No. US-A-3,519,931.
However, the technique there disclosed calculates the
unknown voltage on the basis of resistor values of the
voltage divider and therefore still requires the
resistor values to be accurately known. It is therefore an object of the present
invention to provide a technique for accurately
measuring an unknown voltage with a voltage divider
network whose component values are not known with
certainty.This object is achieved by the invention
claimed in claims 1 and 10.An embodiment of the invention will now be
described, by way of example, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a voltage
divider, andFigure 2 is a block diagram of a power meter. It is well known that a set of N simultaneous
equations with N unknowns can be solved for each of the N
unknowns. The present embodiment applies this concept to
the measurement of a voltage through a voltage divider.Figure 1 depicts a resistive voltage divider
network 10 comprising switches S1, S2 and resistors R1, R2,
R3. Switches S1, S2 may be considered ideal switches for
the purposes of the following discussion. The output
voltage Vo1 may be computed from the following three
equations, which correspond to three states of the voltage
divider (as discussed below, the condition S1 and S2 open
at the same time should be avoided in power meter
applications):Condition 1: S1 closed
(1)   Vo1 = VIN * R2/(R1 + R2)Condition 2: S2 closed
(2)   V
