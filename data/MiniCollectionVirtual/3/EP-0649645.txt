<ABSTRACT>
A bed footboard has a main body (22) with a cavity (34) that 
is configured to receive a panel (52) and a pocket member 

behind the panel to store patient records. The panel is 
pivotally mounted in the cavity to permit access to the 

pocket member and records held in the pocket. The panel is 
slidable in the pivotal mounting and has a retaining lip 

that can be engaged to a retaining flange in the cavity to 
enable the panel to be retained partially within the cavity 

and disposed to serve as a writing surface. The panel has 
a biased retracting mechanism that enables the panel to be 

released from the pivotal mounting. The main body of the 
panel has channels in which bolts can be slidably extended 

above the top surface of the main body. The panel has openings 
configured to receive the bolts to enable the panel to 

be mounted above the top surface of the main body and serve 
as a utility tray.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to footboards for
beds and more particularly to footboards that are
convertible to perform more than one function.Hospital rooms typically are not provided with much
furniture beyond a bed, a bed stand, and perhaps a
chair. The hospital bed typically is not provided with
any storage space. Thus, when the hospital staff moves
a patient's bed from one room to another while
supporting the patient during the move, an additional
member of the hospital staff may be required to gather
the patient's personal effects and physically carry them
to the new location.Various hospital records associated with the care
of a patient typically are kept on a clipboard that is
attached to the footboard of the bed. This arrangement
places these records in full view of persons, such as
visitors, who do not need and perhaps should not have,
access to such records. Moreover, the preparation of
these records would be facilitated by a convenient
writing surface in the vicinity of the footboard of the
bed. Unless a food service tray happens to be on the
bed at the time the records are being prepared, such
writing surface often is not available. In FR-A-811
006, a footboard with a recess receives a flat tablet
that can be withdrawn completely from the recess and
deployed in a horizontal plane disposed above the top
surface of the footboard.It is a principal object of the present invention
to provide a footboard that can be manipulated to 
perform other functions useful in the hospital
environment.It also is a principal object of the present
invention to provide a bed footboard with a manually
detachable panel that can be manipulated to perform
other functions that are useful in a hospital
environment.It is a further principal object of the present
invention to provide a bed footboard with the capability
of storing patient records out of clear view, yet easily
accessible to hospital staff when needed.Another principal object of the present invention
is to provide a bed footboard with a panel that is
easily and quickly manipulated by hand to assume an
orientation that 
provides a convenient writing surface for the preparation
of patient records.Yet another principal object of the present invention
is to provide a bed footboard with a panel that can be
manually deployed at the foot of the bed to serve as a
utility shelf that can function equally well while the bed
is stationary or being moved from one location to another.Additional objects and advantages of the invention
will be set forth in part in the

a panel (52) configured to be received in said
storage cavity;
a means (60, 62, 63) for mounting said panel in
said storage cavity; and
said footboard being characterized by a means (84,
86, 60) for partially retaining said panel (52) in said

storage cavity (34) in an inclined position relative to
said front surface (24) of said main body (22).
A convertible footboard as in claim 1, wherein:

said panel having a front surface (54) and a back
surface (55) disposed opposite said front surface, said

panel having a left side surface (56) disposed between
the left side of said front surface and the left side of

said back surface, said panel having a right side
surface (57) disposed between the right side of said

front surface and the right side of said back surface
and opposite to said left side surface;
said storage cavity being defined by a rear wall
(36), a top side wall (37) disposed normally to said

rear wall; and
said means for partially retaining said panel in an
inclined position in said storage cavity includes: 


a retaining lip (84) disposed to extend from
said front surface (54) of said panel (52) along a

front edge of said panel; and
