<ABSTRACT>
The performance agent (2i) executes at least a diagnosis check when a step has been exceeded by calling up an internal diagnostic function (5i) of the SNMP performance agent (2i) managed by the SNMP(1) of the local computer (OL), and to transmit a diagnostic notification including diagnostic data. The devices is designed to permit monitoring of remote computers (OD1, ... Odn) form an SNMP manager (1) installed in a local computer (OL) through a network (10). The device includes a performance agent (2) installed in each remote computer (Odi), designed to detect the passing of a consumption step or several resources of the remote computer (Odi) from a function of the step (8i), managed by the SNMP (1) of the local computer (OL). This function allows parameter setting of the performance agent by indicating a determined step for each monitored activity and transmission of any passing of the step level. An Independent Claim is included for a method for optimizing steps for consumption parameters.
