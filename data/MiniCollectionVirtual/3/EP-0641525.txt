<ABSTRACT>
Using a slurry containing a particulate or fibrous 
cellulose ester and a wood pulp with a Canadian standard 

freeness of 100 to 800 ml in a ratio of 10/90 to 
90/10 (weight %), a tobacco filter material in the form 

of a sheet having a nonwoven web structure is produced. 
The slurry may contain a microfibrillated cellulose in 

a proportion of 0.1 to 10 weight % on a nonvolatile 
matter basis. The cellulose ester may be a cellulose 

acetate with a combined acetic acid in the range of 30 
to 62%. This tobacco filter material in a sheet form 

can be applied to a tobacco filter having a high dry 
strength and, yet, a high degree of wet disintegratability 

without adversely affecting the smoking quality 
of tobacco. Thus, the potential environmental pollution 

is mitigated by the tobacco filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tobacco filter
material with very satisfactory wet disintegratability,
a method of producing the tobacco filter material, and
a tobacco filter insuring a good aroma and palatability
of tobacco smoke as produced using the filter material.As a tobacco filter which removes tars from the
tobacco smoke and insures a satisfactory smoking quality,
a filter plug prepared by shaping a tow (fiber
bundle) of cellulose acetate fiber with a plasticizer
such as triacetin is known. In this filter, however,
the constituent filaments have been partly fused together
by the plasticizer so that when it is discarded
after smoking, it takes a long time for the filter plug
to disintegrate itself in the environment, thus adding
to the pollution problem.Meanwhile, a tobacco filter made of a creped paper
manufactured from wood pulp and a tobacco filter made
from a regenerated cellulose fiber are also known.
Compared with a filter plug comprising a cellulose
acetate fiber, these filters are slightly more wet-disintegratable
and, thus, of somewhat lower pollution 
potential. However, in these filters, not only the
aroma and palatability of tobacco smoke are sacrificed
but the efficiency of selective elimination of phenols
which is essential to tobacco filters can hardly be
expected. Moreover, at the same pressure loss, the
firmness or hardness of these filters is lower than
that of the cellulose acetate filter.Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
96208/1977 (JP-A-52-96208) discloses a sheet consisting
of an acetylcellulose pulp prepared in a specified
manner and short staples of a thermoplastic resin.
However, because this sheet is manufactured by mix-webbing
the pulp and short staples and heating the
resulting paper under pressure, it is high in tensile
strength and elongation after immersion in water as
well as in water resistance and very low in disintegratability.GB-A-1 244 609 discloses a cigarette filter made of a
sheet comprising a mixture of cellulose acetate fibers and
wood pulp preferrably in equal proportion. This document does
not disclose the combined use of a particulate cellulose ester
or non-crimped fibrous cellulose ester with wood pulp having
Canadian standard freeness values of 100 to 800 ml. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
45468/1978 (JP-A-53-45468) corresponding to US Patent
Application Serial No. 730039 discloses a filter material
comprising a nonwoven sheet containing 5 to 35
weight % of fine cellulose ester fibrils with a large
surface area and 65 to 95
