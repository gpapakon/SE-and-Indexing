<ABSTRACT>
The advertising vehicle, of the bicycle, motor cycle and similar type, whether or not fitted with a tow-hitch trailer, is noteworthy in that, on one or more of its wheels, it accommodates a support facility capable of accommodating an advertising panel, the said support facility being fixed to the fixed part of the corresponding light vehicle by appropriate means allowing it to be rapidly fitted and removed, and in that the said advertising panel is in a fixed position which is independent of the rolling and forward movement effect of the vehicle in order to allow reading of the marking and of the advertising, according to an effect of slippage with respect to the ground.
