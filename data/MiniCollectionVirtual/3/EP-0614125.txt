<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for preparing flexible 
photo-sensible printing plates arranged on a cylindrical 

carrier, comprising exposing, developing and attaching the 
flexible photo-sensible printing plates on the cylindrical 

carrier, wherein the flexible photo-sensible printing 
plates are initially attached onto the cylindrical 

carrier, and the flexible photo-sensible printing plates 
are exposed in the situation arranged on the cylinder and 

then developed. 
In preference a transparency provided with a pattern is 
arranged in register on the flexible photo-sensible 

printing plates and the flexible photo-sensible printing 
plate is then exposed through the transparency. 
The invention likewise relates to a device for preparing 
a printing plate attached onto a cylindrical carrier, 

comprising a mandrel for fixing the cylindrical carrier 
and an exposure member for exposing the flexible photo-sensible 

printing plate attached onto the cylindrical 
carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing 
flexible photo-sensible printing plates arranged on a 
cylindrical carrier fit for printing, comprising exposing, 
developing and attaching the flexible photo-sensible 
printing plates on the cylindrical carrier. Such a method is generally known. In this known method, starting from an unexposed 
printing plate, the flexible photo-sensible printing plate 
is initially exposed and developed. It is then washed and 
dried. Prior to the start of the printing process the 
printing plate thus prepared for flexible printing or 
rotation relief printing must be attached onto a so-called 
format cylinder, or attached onto a so-called sleeve, 
whereafter the sleeve with the printing plate etc. must be 
fixed on the format cylinder. The fixing of the flexible printing plate on this 
cylindrical carrier must take place in register in order 
to allow the printing plate to print in register. This is 
a laborious process requiring complicated machines and 
great skill, and is moreover time-consuming. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
method wherein the above stated drawbacks are avoided. This object is achieved in that the flexible photo-sensible 
printing plates are initially attached onto the 
cylindrical carrier, and the flexible photo-sensible 
printing plates are exposed in the situation arranged on 
the cylinder and then developed. The printing plate attached to the cylinder or sleeve 
thus fit for printing is thus in register and it can be 
applied onto the printing cylinder without time consuming 
handling and it can be printed. The invention likewise relates to a device for preparing 
a printing plate attached onto a cylindrical carrier fit 
for printing, comprising a mandrel for fixing the  
 
cylindrical carrier and a member for exposing in register 
the flexible photo-sensible printing plate attached onto 
the cylindrical carrier. It is noted that a device and a method for exposing a 
flexible photo-sensible printing plate attached to a 
cylindrical carrier are known from DE-A-260382. The method 
for attaching the printing plate to the carrier is however 
not permanent; when the cylindrical carrier is removed 
from the carrier the vacuum will disappear and the 
printing plate will come loose from the cylindrical 
carrier. Besides use is made of a transparent foil which 
does allow exposure of the printing plate, but which does 
not allow printing. The invention will be elucidated hereinbelow with 
reference to the annexed figure, in

Method for preparing flexible photo-sensible printing 

plates arranged on a cylindrical carrier, comprising 
exposing, developing and attaching the flexible photo-sensible 

printing plates on the cylindrical carrier, 
characterized in that the flexible photo-sensible printing 

plates are initially attached onto the cylindrical 
carrier, and the flexible photo-sensible printing plates 

are exposed in register in the situation arranged on the 
cylinder and then developed. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that a 
transparency provided with a pattern is arranged in 

register on the flexible photo-sensible printing plates 
and that the flexible photo-sensible printing plate is 

then exposed through the transparency. 
Device for preparing a printing plate attached onto a 
cylindrical carrier, comprising a mandrel for fixing the 

cylindrical carrier and an exposure member for exposing 
the flexible photo-sensible printing plate attached onto 

the cylindrical carrier. 
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the exposure member is formed by a light source with an 

intensity which can be modulated which is movable parallel 
to the shaft of the mandrel, and wherein the intensity is 

modulated by information stored in a memory and relating 
to the image to be printed. 
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized by means 
for fixing a carrier comprising a pattern in register on 

the flexible photo-sensible printing plate. 
Device as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the means for fixing the carrier comprising a pattern on 

the flexible photo-sensible printing plate are formed by 
cameras provided with a sight, wherein the position of the 

cameras is adjustable using a position reference. 
Device as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the cameras are placed above the shaft of the mandrel and 

 
are movable along the shaft of the mandrel. 
Device as claimed in any of the claims 5-7, characterized 
in that the exposure member comprises a light 

source, wherein between the light source and the transparent 
carrier provided with a pattern means are arranged 

for pressing the carrier against the flexible photo-sensible 
printing plate. 
Device as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that 
the pressing means are formed by an endless transparent 

band, manufactured for instance from polyester, guided 
between the carrier and the light source.
