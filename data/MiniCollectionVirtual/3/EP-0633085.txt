<ABSTRACT>
A cutting tool for cutting a honeycomb core has a 
plurality of spiral blades (3) each of which is formed 

integrally with a cylindrical body (2) of the cutting 
tool and has a lead angle (γ) of 60 degrees or more 

with respect to an axis of the cylindrical body (2). 
Each of the blades (3) comprises a radial edge (4) 

with a lip angle (α) ranging from 1 degree to 20 
degrees along the periphery of the cutting tool and a 

bottom edge (5) with a lip angle (β) ranging from 1 
degree to 20 degrees at the bottom of the cutting 

tool. The bottom edge (5) is curved outward in the 
revolutional direction of the blade.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool
for cutting honeycomb cores.A commonly used cutting tool for cutting
honeycomb cores has a valve stem shaped cutter
(hereinafter referred to as "valve stem cutter")
having a sharp cutting edge like a razor blade built
along the periphery of a conical disk.Since this valve stem cutter has no kerf on the
cutting edge, it keeps in a linear contact with a
workpiece during cutting and consequently this type of
cutter tends to become burned at the cutting edge due
to frictional heat. Further, differently from usual
cutting tools, since the valve stem cutter cuts a
workpiece with a slitting or splitting action by
continuously applying an edge laterally, a high
rotational speed is required. However, on the other
hand, the feed speed can not be raised sufficiently
for the high rotational speed of the cutting tool and
as a result in some cases it becomes difficult for
this type of cutting tool to cut a plate having a
honeycomb core, if the thickness of the plate is
large.As an improved valve stem cutter, there is
proposed a cutting tool for cutting a honeycomb core
in which several splitting saws with a different
diameter are coaxially heaped up so as to break tips
produced from the splitting saws with a large diameter
by the splitting saws with a small diameter (Japanese
utility application laid open No. 1989-315).However, the cutting edge of this splitting type
cutter is not as keen as a razor edge and therefore
problems occur, eg. a large cutting resistance is
applied on it, burrs tend to be produced on its 
cutting plane and a workpiece tends to be deposited on
its cutting edge at high speed cuttings because it has
a small chip pocket and a straight edge.On the other hand, as another type of cutting
tool for a honeycomb core which is different from the
above splitting type cutter, there is an intermittent
cutting type of cutter. For example, as disclosed in
Japanese Utility application published No. 1991-75922,
there is a cutting tool having a disk-shaped cutter
with a chip space and a radial relief angle at the
cutting edge. The chip space of the disk-shaped
cutter is integrally connected to the chip space of
the chip breaker. Furthermore, in order to raise a
bite-in characteristic and at the same time to reduce
a cutting resistance, an axial rake angle is built in
the disk-shaped cutter along the chip space twisted
towards the right hand and additionally a positive
radial rake angle is built both in the cutter and the
chip breaker.This intermittent cutting

A cutting tool for cutting a honeycomb core
(W), comprising:


a shank (1);
a cylinder (2) coaxially connected to said shank
(1); and
a circumferential cutting edge (4) spirally and integrally
formed on said cylinder (2);
a bottom edge (5) formed at a lower end of
said circumferential cutting edge (4) to initially

bite in said honeycomb core (W); and
a boundary portion (4a) interposed between
said circumferential cutting edge (4) and said bottom

edge (5) to smoothly connect therebetween and to cut a
boundary region of said honeycomb core (W); and

wherein:
said circumferential cutting edge (4) has a lead angle (τ) which is
60 degrees or greater with respect to the longitudinal axis of said

cylinder (2); and
lip angles (α, β) of said circumferential cutting
edge (4) and said bottom edge (5) are between 1 and 20

degrees,

characterised in that:
said circumferential cutting edge is formed by a plurality of
blades (3);
wherein each blade has a circumferential bevel inclined upwardly
and outwardly relative to the tool axis, meeting an upper

surface of the blade to form a circumferential cutting edge (4)
at the outermost part of the blade to continuously cut said

honeycomb core (W).
A cutting tool as claimed in claim 1, wherein
one end of said bottom edge (5) is connected to said

cylinder (2) on a bottom face of said cylinder.
A cutting tool as claimed in claim 1 or claim
2, wherein one end of said bottom edge (5) is

connected to said cylinder (2) on a circumferential 
surface of said cylinder.
A cutting tool as claimed in any of claims 1
to 3, wherein said circumferential cutting edge (4),

said bottom edge (5) and said boundary portion (4a)
are formed integrally and continuously on said blade

so as to reduce cutting resistance.
A cutting tool as claimed in any of claims 1
to 4, wherein an edge line of said bottom edge (5) is

curved outward in a revolutional direction of said
cutting tool.
A cutting tool as claimed in any of claims 1
to 5, wherein a radial rake angle (

) of said bottom
edge (5) is negative so as to reduce cutting

resistance.
A cutting tool as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein the bottom edge (5) cuts the honeycomb

core with a width of cut approximately corresponding
to a diameter of the cutting tool and the radial edge

(4) cuts the honeycomb core continuously by a
splitting-scraping effect up to a depth corresponding

to a vertical length of the radial edge, resulting in
removal of material from the honeycomb core in the

form of small chips or flakes.
