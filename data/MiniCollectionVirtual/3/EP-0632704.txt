<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a clip for fitting on a hanger. The clip has a first and second leg (10, 20) with two bent-up sides (12; 21) in which there are holes (14; 23) for fitting the legs (10, 20) on the hanger, wherein the sides (12, 21) which are bent in opposite directions fit together in pairs with one side (21) of each leg (10, 20) on the inside and the other side (12) of the same leg (10, 20) on the outside, and a leg spring (4) fitted between the clip legs (10, 20) and holding the clips (3) closed. The inner bent side (21) of one clip leg (10; 20) is rotatably engaged with the outer bent side (12) of the other leg (20; 10) and the leg spring (4) axially fills the space between the inner bent sides (21) of the clip legs (10, 20).

<CLAIMS>
Clamp (3) for arrangement on a carrying arm (1),

with a first and a second clamp half (10, 20) each
with two lateral angle pieces (11, 12; 21, 22), in each

of which is located a hole (13, 14; 23, 24) for the
positioning of the clamp halves (10, 20) on the carrying

arm (1), the angle pieces (11, 22 and 12, 21) which are
directed against each other lying pairwise against each

other and in each case one angle piece (11; 21) of each
clamp half (10, 20) lying on the inside and the other

angle piece (12; 22) of the same clamp half (10, 20)
lying on the outside, and the holes (13, 14; 23, 24)

contacting the carrying arm (1) upon arrangement of the
clamp on the carrying arm (1), and with a legged spring

(4) which keeps the clamp (3) closed and fills, in axial
direction, the space between the inner angle pieces (11;

21) of the clamp halves (10, 20)

characterized in that
the respective inner angle piece (11; 21) of one clamp
half (10; 20) interlocks rotatably with the outer angle

piece (22; 12) of the other clamp half (20; 10), by either
a part (15) of the respective inner angle piece (11; 21)

being offset, cranked or bent outwardly and engaging in a
corresponding aperture (36) or the hole (14; 24) in the

respective outer angle piece (12; 22), or, inversely, a
part (45, 55, 65, 75) of the respective outer angle piece

(12; 22) being offset, cranked or bent inwardly and
engaging in a corresponding aperture (46) or the hole (13;

23) in the respective inner angle piece (11; 21).
Clamp according to claim 1, characterized in that the
legged spring (4) presses against the internal angle

pieces (11, 21).
Clamp according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a
semi-circular edge zone (15) of the hole (13, 23) of the

inner angle piece (11, 21) is outwardly cranked or offset
and that the hole (14, 24) of the abutting outer angle

piece (12, 22) has a diameter such that it can accommodate
the cranked zone (15).
Clamp according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that
the cranked edge zone (15) is surrounded by an annular

zone (19) which lies in the plane of the angle piece (11,
21).
Clamp according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that a
projection (16) which extends up to the carrying arm (1)

protrudes into the hole (14, 24) of the outer angle piece
(12, 22).
Clamp hanger with a carrying arm (1) and with clamps (3),
characterized in that the clamps (3) are such according to

one of claims 1 to 5.
