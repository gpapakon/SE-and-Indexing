<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a process for 
preparing a 2,3-di-substituted cyclopentanone mixture 

containing an enriched cis-2,3-di-substituted 
cyclopentanone which comprises heating a trans-2,3-di-substituted 

cyclopentanone in the presence of 100 ppm 
or less (weight basis) of a metal carbonate based on 

the cyclopentanone. The invention also discloses a 
fragrant composition comprising 20 to 50 wt% of 

2,3-di-substituted cis-methyl (dihydro)jasmonates and 
80 to 50 wt% of 2,3-di-substituted (dihydro) 

trans-methyl (dihydro)jasmonates. The fragrant 
composition has jasmine flower-like fragrance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
for preparing a 2,3-di-substituted cyclopentanone
mixture and a fragrant composition comprising the mixture
which has excellent jasmine flower-like fragrance as
well as a diluted fragrant composition.2 ,3-Di-substituted cyclopentanones represented
by methyl jasmonate and methyl dihydrojasmonate are
chemical substances useful in the fields of fragrance,
drugs, chemicals and the like.Such 2,3-di-substituted cyclopentanones involve
steric isomers of cis-isomer and trans-isomer, as shown by
general formulae (I) through (IV) described below.
Recent studies reveal that the cis-isomer is excellent
in organoleptic evaluation and physiological activity,
as compared to the trans-isomer.

(wherein R1 represents a hydrocarbon residue and R2
represents a hydrocarbon residue which may optionally
have a substituent)In the case of, for example, methyl jasmonate,
it is reported that the essence of its fragrance is
present in the cis-isomer (Agricultrual and Biological
Chemistry, 49, 769, 1985) and that the cis-isomer is
more active in the physiological activity on plants
than the trans-isomer or a mixture of the cis-isomer
and the trans-isomer (Preprints of the Plant Physiological
Association, page 347, 1989; Plant Physiology, 66,
246, 1980, etc.).Based on these findings, synthesis of and
research on cis-2,3-di-substituted cyclopentanones have
been extensively made. The syntheses of, for example,
methyl jasmonate or methyl dihydrojasmonate are reported
in Preprints of the 29th Discussions on Fragrance,
Terpene and Essential oil Chemistry, page 222, 1985;
Preprints of the 30th Discussions, page 101, 1986;
Preprints of the 32nd Discussions, page 132, 1988; etc.
However, these processes fail to efficiently produce 
the cis-isomer. In addition, the processes encounter
practical problems since many reaction steps are involved
and expensive reactants are used.On the other hand, it is known that when the
cis-isomer is compared to the trans-isomer, the trans-isomer
is generally advantageous in view of equilibrium.
It was thus studied to obtain the cis-isomer efficiently
by converting the trans-isomer into the cis-isomer
and recently, a process for treating methyl jasmonate
with p-toluenesulfonic acid in the presence of a solvent
was reported (Fragrance Industry News, No. 247, April
15, 1988, page 6). According to the process, however,
the yield of the cis-isomer is as low as about 5%. In
addition, there is a fear that side reactions tend to
occur.As described above, methyl jasmonate

<CLAIMS>
A fragrant composition comprising 20 to 50 wt% of the
cis-isomers (racemate) of methyl jasmonate or methyl

dihydrojasmonate and 80 to 50 wt% of the trans-isomers
(racemate) of the same jasmonate.
A fragrant composition according to claim 1, which is
obtained by heating the trans-isomers of methyl jasmonate

or methyl dihydrojasmonate in the presence of a metal
carbonate, then distilling the resulting crude mixture of methyl

jasmonate or methyl dihydrojasmonate containing the cis-isomers
of methyl jasmonate or methyl dihydrojasmonate, so

as to purify the mixture of methyl jasmonate or methyl
dihydrojasmonate and then concentrating the resultant by

further distillation.
A fragrant composition of claim 1, which further
comprises a volatile solvent at normal temperature.
A fragrant composition of claim 3, wherein said
volatile solvent at normal temperature is an alcohol or an

aqueous solution of alcohol.
A fragrant composition of claim 4, wherein the cis-
and trans-isomers of methyl jasmonate or methyl

dihydrojasmonate are 0.1 to 20 wt% in total.
