<ABSTRACT>
A roof air-vent pipe (D) has a projecting dome (9) on the top side of a metallic roof-covering plate (1) and a vent pipe (7) carried by the dome over a cap (19). In order to obain a roof ventilator which is particularly efficient in use, the plastic dome which carries a plastic vent pipe (7) is set on the marginal area (8) of a hole (2) cut out in a roof-covering plate (1).

Roof vent (D) having a dome (9) projecting over the 
upper side of a metallic roofing plate (1) and a 

ventilating pipe (7) supported by the latter through a hood 
(19), the
 dome (9) consisting of plastic and supporting a 
ventilating pipe (7) capable of having its inclination 

adjusted being attached through a collar (10) at the 
peripheral region (8) of a hole (L) cut into the roofing 

plate (1), characterised in that the peripheral region (8) 
of the hole (L) is bent upwardly, is open towards the inner 

side in the region of bearing pockets (15) and together 
with this open region forms sliding surfaces (31) for the 

introduction of hinge pins (16) of the ventilating pipe 
(7). 
Roof vent according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the bearing pockets (15) continue out beyond the front edge 

of the upwardly bent peripheral region (8). 
Roof vent according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that on the outside of the bearing 

pockets (15) there is a twofold, stepped drop-down (33, 34) 
of the casing surface or side walls (18) of the dome (9). 
Roof vent according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the dome (9) is injection 

moulded to the peripheral region (8) of the roofing plate 
(1). 
Roof vent according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the peripheral region (8) has 

holes (12) which are pierced by bridges (13) extending 
between fork tines (14) of the collar (10). 
Roof vent according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
in the upwardly bent perforated edge (8), the holes (12)  

 
are distorted out of the original, especially circular, 

shape. 
Roof vent according to Claims 1 and 4, characterised 
by a proportion of powdered copper (28) as admixture in the 

plastic injection moulding compound of the dome (9). 
Roof vent according to Claims 1, 4 and 7, 
characterised in that the ventilating pipe (7) and the hood 

(19) also contain a powdery and/or flaky copper admixture.
