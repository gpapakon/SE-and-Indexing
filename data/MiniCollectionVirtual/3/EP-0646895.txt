construction and structure, to which a function section 

relating to main information processing can be easily 
attached, and which has improved portability, and a method for 

producing it are disclosed. This thin IC card is 
characterized by including a plate type IC module in which a 

semiconductor device having at least memory function and CPU 
function has its one side sealed or molded with a resin, and 

flat type externally connecting terminals have their one end 
connected to the input/output terminals of the semiconductor 

device and the other end led and exposed to a non-resin sealed 
or molded side, and a card-like support which has a fitting 

section for fitting the plate type IC module with the surface 
of the externally connecting terminals of the plate type IC 

module exposed to be substantially flush with the surface of 
the card, a required circuit wiring, an antenna for sending 

and receiving a signal without contacting, and if necessary an

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thin IC card and a method for
producing a thin IC card.Conventionally known storage means for recording or
storing various data include, for example, contact type
microcomputer cards having a built-in CPU and non-contact type
wireless cards which use an electric wave to send and receive
information. These cards are generally called the IC card,
have advantages and superiority in practical uses, and are
practically used broadly in the form utilizing their
advantages and superiority. In view of the inconvenience in
using these cards properly depending on where they are used,
composite IC cards which have the advantages and superiority
of the contact type and non-contact type IC cards have been
developed (e.g. Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-16831).
Specifically, such IC cards have (a) the advantages of the
contact type IC card which processes inputs from an external
device connected via electrical contacts by a semiconductor
chip (IC chip) having the functions of a memory or CPU built
in the IC card, takes out the processed inputs as a new 
signal, and automatically checks the signal, and (b) the advantages of the non-contact
type IC card in which an electromagnetic field formed by an external device is received
by an antenna and rectified or detected to obtain a signal, information previously stored
is called by this signal, and the required processing of information is conducted without
complexity and contacting.In the above composite IC cards, the CPU having the memory function relating
to main information processing is fixed, so that the capacity and functions of the
composite IC cards are limited. Therefore, it is necessary to always maintain or having
a built-in semiconductor chip as the function element for each use. In other words, it is
always necessary to keep or carry a plurality of composite IC cards having dimensions
(85.6mm long, 54.0mm wide, 0.76mm thick) according to the standard of JEIDA
(Japanese Electronic Industry Development Association), and partically is limited in
view of carrying and space because plural composite IC cards have to be always kept or
carried.DE A 41 05 869 discloses an IC card with an IC element on a support film.
The support film comprising contacts and antennas for contact and non-contact communication.
The IC element is not freely detachable from the support film. EP A 0 231 3 discloses a
printed wiring board for IC cards. There is no antenna for receiving the signal without
contacting.DE 42 18 923 discloses an IC card with a
