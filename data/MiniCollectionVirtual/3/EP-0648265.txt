<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides methods and compositions for transferring large transgene polynucleotides and unlinked selectable marker polynucleotides into eukaryotic cells by a novel method designated co-lipofection. The methods and compositions of the invention are used to produce novel transgenic non-human animals harboring large transgenes, such as a transgene comprising a human APP gene or human immunoglobulin gene.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR PRODUCING TRANSGENIC NON-HUMAN ANIMALS HARBORING A YEAST ARTIFICIAL CHROMOSOMETECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to transgenic non-human animals capable of expressing xenogenic polypeptides, transgenes used to produce such transgenic animals, transgenes capable of expressing xenogenic polypeptides, yeast artificial chromosomes comprising a polynucleotide sequence encoding a human protein such as a human immunoglobulin or amyloid precursor protein (APP) , methods and transgenes for transferring large polynucleotide sequences into cells, and methods for co-lipofection of discontinuous polynucleotide sequences into cells.BACKGROUND OF'THE INVENTION Transferring exogenous genetic material into cells is the basis for modern molecular biology. The continuing development of novel met ods for improving the efficiency, specificity, and/or size limitations of the transfer process has broadened the scope of research and product development by enabling the production of polynucleotide clones and recombinant organisms that previously were impractical or impossible to construct. Calcium phosphate precipitation, electroporation, lipofection, ballistic transfer, DEAE-dextran transfection, microinjection, and viral-based transfer methods, among others, have been described for introducing foreign DNA fragments into mammalian cells.The art also has developed yeast artificial chromosome ("YAC") cloning vectors which are capable of propagating large (50 to more than 1000 kilobases) cloned inserts (U.S. Patent 4,889,806) of xenogenic DNA. YAC clone 

libraries have been used to identify, map, and propagate lar fragments of mammalian genomic DNA. YAC cloning is especial useful for isolating intact genes, particularly large genes having exons spanning several tens of kilobases or more, and genes having distal regulatory elements located tens of kilobases or more upstream or downstream from the exonic sequences. YAC cloning is particularly advantageous for isolating large complex gene loci, such as unrearranged immunoglobulin gene loci, and genes which have been inexactl mapped to an approximate chromosomal region (e.g., aHuntington's chorea gene). YAC cloning is also well-suited for making vectors for performing targeted homologous recombination in mammalian cells, since YACs allow the cloni of large contiguous sequences useful as recombinogenic homology regions in homologous targeting vectors. Moreover, YACs afford a system for doing targeted homologous recombination in a yeast host cell to create novel, large
