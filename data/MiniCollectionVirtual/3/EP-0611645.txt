<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connection element, comprising two strips which can be connected to the parts and/or elements to be connected and, after pressing them together, adhere releasably on each other. For achieving the object of providing such a connection element which is distinguished by very low height and particular softness and flexibility, the first strip consists of a supporting band of flexible material, on which there is adhesively applied a fine-grained to powdery material. The other strip consists of a material having elasto-plastic properties.

<CLAIMS>
Connection element, comprising two strips which
can be connected to the parts and/or elements to be

connected and, after pressing together, adhere
releasably to each other, characterized in that the

first strip comprises a supporting band (2) of flexible
material, onto which a fine-grained to powdered

material (4) is adhesively bonded, and the other strip
(1) consists of a material adjusted to a low hardness

and with elasto-plastic properties.
Connection element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the first strip comprises a

supporting band of a woven fabric or a plastic film,
onto which the fine-grained to powdered material is

adhesively bonded by a polymer adhesive or lacquer.
Connection element according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the fine-grained to powdered

material has a grain size of approximately 50 Âµm.
Connection element according to one of Claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the fine-grained to

powdered material consists of silicic acid.
Connection element according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the fine-grained material

consists of water-repellent, highly dispersed silicic
acid.
Connection element according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the other strip

consists of a silicone rubber. 
Connection element according to Claim 6,
characterized in that water-repellent, highly dispersed

silicic acid is added to the silicone rubber.
Connection element according to one of Claims 6
or 7, characterized in that the silicone rubber

consists of an addition-crosslinking silicone rubber.
