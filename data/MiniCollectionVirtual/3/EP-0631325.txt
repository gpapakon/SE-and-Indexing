<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device which
has a TFT (thin-film transistor) built onto an insulating substrate
made of glass or the like, and to a method for its preparation.Thin-film transistors (hereunder, TFTs) are known which
employ thin-film semiconductors. These TFTs are constructed by
forming a thin-film semiconductor on a substrate and using the
thin-film semiconductor. These TFTs are used in various
integrated circuits, but particular attention is being given to their
use in electrooptical devices, especially as switching elements
constructed for the respective picture elements of active matrix-type
liquid crystal displays and driving elements formed in
peripheral circuit sections.The TFTs used in these devices generally employ thin-film
silicon semiconductors. Thin-film silicon semiconductors are 
largely classified into two types: amorphous silicon
semiconductors (a-Si) and silicon semiconductors with
crystallinity. Amorphous silicon semiconductors have a low
preparation temperature, they may be relatively easily prepared by
a vapor phase process, and they lend themselves well to mass
preparation, for which reasons they are the most widely used type;
however, their physical properties such as conductivity, etc. are
inferior in comparison with those of silicon semiconductors with
crystallinity, and thus ardent attempts to establish new methods
of preparing silicon semiconductor TFTs with crystallinity have
been made in order to obtain more high-speed properties in the
future. As crystalline silicon semiconductors, there are known
polycrystalline silicon, microcrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon
which also contains crystalline components, and semi-amorphous
silicon in an intermediate state between crystalline and amorphous
solids. The following methods are known for obtaining thin-film silicon
semiconductors with crystallinity:
(1) Direct formation of a crystalline film at the time of its formation.(2) Formation of an amorphous semiconductor film to which crystallinity is
then imparted using the energy of laser light.(3) Formation of an amorphous semiconductor film to which a crystallinity
is then imparted by adding heat energy.However, in method (1), it is technically difficult to form a uniform film
with satisfactory semiconducting properties over the entire surface of the
substrate, while another drawback is the cost, since with the film forming
temperature being as high as 600Â°C or above inexpensive glass substrates
cannot be used. In method (2), there is first the
