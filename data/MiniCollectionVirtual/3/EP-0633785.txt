<ABSTRACT>
A shed form of leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (LAM-1, L-selectin) is present in high levels in human plasma. Quantitative methods of detecting shed LAM-1 (sLAM-1) by Western blot and ELISA analysis are disclosed. Also disclosed are methods for the specific detection of cell-surface bound LAM-1 in the presence of shed LAM-1 and for immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies reactive with cell-surface bound LAM-1 but not reactive with shed LAM-1.

 SPECIFIC DETECTION OF CELL SURFACE RECEPTOR LEUKOCYTE ADHESION MOLECULE-1RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of Tedder, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/730,503, filed July 8, 1991, which is a continuation under 37 CFR 1.62 of Serial No. 07/313,109, filed February 21, 1989, now abandoned; of Tedder, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/700,773, filed May 15, 1991; of Tedder, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/737,092, filed July 29, 1991; and of Tedder et al., U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/770,608, filed October 3, 1991, the whole of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to human leukocyte-associated cell surface proteins, particularly to leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (LAM-1) and methods for its detection.Part of the work leading to this invention was made with United States Government funds. Therefore, the U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe ability of leukocytes to leave the circulation and to migrate into tissues is a critical feature of the immune response. Normally, the infiltrating leukocytes phagocytize invading organisms or dead or damaged cells. However, in pathologic inflammation, infiltrating leukocytes can cause serious and sometimes deadly damage. Leukocyte-mediated inflammation is implicated in a number of human clinical manifestations, including the adult respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and reperfusion injury.Several different receptor adhesion molecules participate in the process of adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes through vascular endothelium at sites of 

inflammation (Springer, Nature 346:425-434 (1990)). One of the several molecules involved in the initial attachment of leukocytes to endothelium is the leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (LAM-1, L-selectin) (Kishimoto et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:2244-2248 (1990); Ley et al., Blood 21:2553-2555 (1991); Spertini et al., J. Immunol. 147:2565- 2573 (1991)) . LAM-1 is a member of the selectin family of adhesion molecules (Bowen et al., J. Cell Biol. 109:421-427 (1989); Siegelman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA8_6:5562- 5566 (1989); Tedder et al. , J. Exp. Med. 17j0:123-133 (1989)) that includes, the mouse L-selectin, MEL-14 (Gallatin et al. , Nature 304:30-34 (1983); Lasky et al., Cell 56:1045-1055 (1989); Siegelman et al. , Science 243:1165-1172 (1989)), Endothelial-Leukocyte Adhesion Molecule-1 (ELAM-1, E-selectin) (Bevilacqua et al. , Proc. Natl.
