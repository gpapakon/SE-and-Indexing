<ABSTRACT>
A recording/reproducing/erasing optical head for 
generating a plurality of light beams detects a defocused 

state by a method in which a light beam is caused to be 
nearly parallel to form optical spots on an opto-magnetic 

disk, the light beam from the optical spots on the opto-magnetic 
disk is condensed on a sensor by an objective lens 

and a condenser lens, and the size of the light spot on the 
sensor spaced by a predetermined distance in front of or 

behind the focal point of the condenser lens, and the size 
of the light spot on the sensor indicate the defocus state, 

wherein if the focal length of the objective lens is denoted 
as f
o
, the numerical aperture of the objective lens as NA, 
the focal length of the condenser lens as f
con
, the 
predetermined distance is Δd[mm]

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical head for an
optical information recording and reproducing apparatus,
such as an opto-magnetic disk apparatus and, more
particularly, to an optical head for forming a plurality of
light spots on a recording medium. The optical head of the
present invention can be applied to an optical information
recording/reproducing/erasing apparatus which performs
recording and reproduction simultaneously or performs
erasure, recording and reproduction simultaneously.Hitherto, an optical head has been proposed which is
capable of simultaneously performing erasure, recording and
reproduction, or recording and reproduction, by using a
plurality of light spots. One of such proposals is
disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,517,667.Fig. 1 is a schematic view illustrating such a
conventional optical head for generating a plurality of 
light beams. In Fig. 1, a monolithic semiconductor laser
array 1 has a first light emitting point 2a and a second
light emitting point 2b. The laser beam emitted from
each of the light emitting points 2a and 2b passes
through a collimator lens 3, a beam splitter 4, a quarter
wavelength plate 5, and an objective lens 6, and is
formed into an image on an optical disk 7 as a recording
light spot 9a and a reproducing light spot 9b,
respectively. The two light spots 9a and 9b are disposed
on the same information track 8 on the optical disk 7 in
such a way that the recording light spot 9a is formed
before the reproducing light spot 9b. The light beams
from the recording light spot 9a and the reproducing
light spot 9b pass through the objective lens 6 and the
quarter wavelength plate 5, reach the beam splitter 4 and
are reflected by this splitter, are condensed by a
condenser lens 10, and reach a sensor 11.An example of an optical system based on what is
commonly called a beam size method for detecting a
defocused state on the basis of the size of a light spot
formed by causing the light spots 9a and 9b to be
projected on the sensor 11 is, in principle, shown in
Figs. 2(a) through 2(c). In Figs. 2(a) through 2(c), the
light beam reflected by the optical disk 7 passes through
the objective lens 6 and is condensed by the condenser
lens 10 on the sensor 11 positioned in front of a focal
point 14 of the condenser 
lens 10. The sensor 11 outputs a signal indicating a
defocused state. Fig. 2(b) shows a case in which the
distance between the objective lens 6 and the optical disk 7
is equal to the focal length of the objective lens 6, and no
defocused state
