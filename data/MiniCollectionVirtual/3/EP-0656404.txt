<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a heat stable red pigment composition comprising a 2,9-dichloroquinacridone 
(I) and a bis-(4,5,6,7-tetrachloroisoindolin-1-on-3-ylidene)-phenylene-1,4-diamine 

pigment (II) and a process for its preparation. The red pigment 
compositions are particularly useful for pigmenting engineering plastics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is to provide a red colored quinacridone pigment of
high saturation which has the heat stability and weatherability for utility as a replacement
for heavy metal pigments in engineering plastics. This object is achieved by the preparation
of red colored pigment compositions by a process comprising the steps of premilling a
pigment mixture of 2,9-dichloroquinacridone pigment and bis-(4,5,6,7-tetrachloroisoindolin-1-on-3-ylidene)-phenylene-1,4-diamine
pigment, and subsequently heating a suspension
of the premilled pigment mixture in a polar solvent to an elevated temperature.Quinacridones are valuable pigments. The gamma crystal modification of the unsubstituted
quinacridone, C.I. Pigment Violet 19, is known for its attractive red color. Although it
is of coloristic interest, the red-colored gamma-phase of unsubstituted quinacridone
possesses insufficient heat stability to have utility for pigmenting the engineering plastics.The U.S. Patent No. 5,095,056 discloses a pigmentary 2,9-dichloroquinacridone having a
specific surface area below 30 m2/g with good heat stability. Due to its very large particle
size, the color is shifted to a unique red color shade from the known magenta color of
smaller particle size 2,9-dichloro-quinacridone. However, its color is still in the magenta
region and readily distinguishable from the red color shade of an unsubstituted gamma
quinacridone. Thus, no red quinacridone pigment is known to possess the heat stability
required for utility as a pigment for the engineering plastics.Isoindolinone pigments, particularly C.I. Pigment Yellow 110, are known to
possess good heat stability and good weatherability.EP 042,816 describes a process for the preparation of pigment alloys by submitting
pigment mixtures containing at least two pigments of the perylene, phthalocyanine,
perinone, quinacridone, quinaphtholone, isoindolinone, isoindoline, dioxazine,
anthraquinone, thioindigo, azo, and azo methine pigment class to a wet milling process.
However, mixtures of 2,9-dichloroquinacridone and a isoindolinone pigment which are
prepared according to the disclosed procedures are very small particle size pigments
which possess insufficient heat stability for use in engineering plastics.The present invention is based on the discovery that red pigment compositions, which
possess high saturation, excellent weatherability and the outstanding heat stability 
required for utility as a pigment in engineering plastics, can be obtained according to the
present
