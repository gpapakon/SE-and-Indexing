<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for determining the parameters of an internal combustion engine, in particular an Otto engine operating with gaseous fuels, has at least one optical sensor for observing the emission of light caused by the combustion in a combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine and at least one photodetector for converting the light emitted into electric signals which are processed in an evaluation unit. In order to achieve a rapid and accurate regulation, the evaluation unit (11) has an arrangement (15) for determining the maximum or mean intensity of the light emitted during each combustion cycle on the basis of the corresponding electric signal. The evaluation unit (11) further has a regulating unit (17) which regulates at least one engine parameter depending on the intensity maxima.

Apparatus for controlling engine parameters, in particular the ignition timing or the 
fuel-air ratio of an internal combustion engine, in particular of a four stroke engine 

driven by gaseous fuels, with at least one optical sensor (1) for observing the light 
emission caused by combustion in a combustion chamber of an internal combustion 

engine, and with at least one photo-sensor (12) for converting the light emission into 
electrical signals, which are processed in an evaluation apparatus (11), characterised 

in that the evaluation apparatus (11) includes an apparatus (15) for determining the 
absolute value of the maximum of the light emission of each combustion cycle from 

the corresponding electrical signal and delivering an output signal reflecting the 
absolute value of the maximum, and that the evaluation apparatus (11) further 

includes a control unit which controls at least one engine parameter dependent upon 
the output signal reflecting the absolute value of the maximum. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the apparatus (15) for sensing 
the maximum is connected on the output side to an averaging device (18) which 

supplies a signal corresponding to the average value of the maxima of intensity of a 
predeterminable number of combustion cycles, wherein the output (19) of the 

averaging device (18) is connected to the actual value input (20) of the control unit 
(17). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the evaluation apparatus 
is provided with an apparatus (21) for sensing combustion misfires, which receives 

on the one hand signals connected with the light emission and on the other hand 
signals from a sensor (22) dependent upon the crankshaft angle and the position of 

the pistons in the engine, and which, when there is an electrical signal below a 
threshold at a point in time or in a time window dependent upon the crankshaft angle 

or the position of the pistons, during which ignition normally takes place, delivers an 
output signal at its output (23). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 and 3, characterised in that the output (23) of the  
 

apparatus (21) for sensing combustion misfires is connected to the averaging device

combustion cycles with combustion misfires in the averaging process. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the output (23) of the 
apparatus (21) for sensing combustion misfires is connected to an emergency shut-off 

system (35) which acts to stop the internal combustion engine after a specified 
number or a specified frequency of misfires.

preferably a high-pass filter, is connected on the input side to the photo-sensor (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that the filtering characteristic of the 
filter and the sensitivity range of the photo-sensor are selected so that there is an 

observation window with a suitable wave-length, also in the UV region.

properties and preferably forms the only optical band pass filter per combustion 
chamber. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that in the case of a
