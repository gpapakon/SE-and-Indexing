<ABSTRACT>
An independently ducted cooling system (30) 
is disclosed for a construction machine (22) having an 

engine compartment (24) enclosing an internal 
combustion engine (26) therein and a cooling system 

compartment (28) enclosing a cooling system (30) 
therein. The cooling system compartment (28) is 

separated from the engine compartment (24) by a noise 
barrier (42). The noise barrier (42) has 

predetermined height and width dimensions associated 
with the engine height and heat exchanger width of the 

cooling system (30), respectively. The cooling system 
(30) is spaced a predetermined distance from the noise 

barrier (42) ranging from about 10-12 percent of the 
noise barrier width for a substantially planar noise 

barrier to about 40 percent of the noise barrier width 
for a noise barrier (42) having beveled edge portions 

(44,46) extending over the engine (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to noise
reduction techniques for construction machinery and,
more particularly, to a compact cooling system and
internal combustion engine arrangement in which the
cooling system is enclosed and ducted independent of
the internal combustion engine.Legislation mandating the reduction of
vehicle noise has forced manufacturers of construction
machinery to reduce or shield the level of noise
produced by both the cooling system and engine of the
construction machinery. Engine noise can be
attenuated by providing engine enclosures having
indirect, acoustically-lined ducts for controlling
airflow to the engine. However, prior engine
enclosures ducted to reduce engine noise have tended
to restrict airflow to the engine cooling system,
therefore requiring higher fan speeds, and associated
higher fan noise levels, to provide sufficient airflow
to the cooling system.For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,923,114 to
Suzuki discloses a common engine and cooling system
compartment formed generally as a closed construction
that both restricts airflow entering the engine
compartment through lined and/or louvered inlets and
restricts airflow exhausting the engine compartment
through acoustically-lined fenders which discharge at
the rear of the vehicle. U.S. Patent No. 4,086,976 to
Holm et al. discloses generally separate engine and 
cooling air compartments which draw in ambient air
independent of one another. However, in U.S. Patent
No. 4,086,976, an engine driven fan extends from the
engine compartment into the cooling air compartment
and through the heat exchanger, complicating both
manufacturing and assembly of the various components.What is needed is an independently ducted,
reduced noise cooling system that includes a noise
barrier similar to that shown in U.S. Patent No.
3,866,580. In U.S. Patent No. 3,866,580, an upright
barrier wall divides an air-cooled enclosure into a
substantially enclosed engine compartment and a
separate engine heat exchanger and fan compartment.
In providing such a noise barrier, the cooling system
should be compact in view of vehicle space
restrictions, while still providing reduced levels of
noise. Ideally, such a cooling system should be
particularly dimensioned, for example relative to the
noise barrier, to provide a cooling system having
reduced levels of noise for a variety of various sized
construction machinery.According to one embodiment of the present
invention, a compact cooling system and internal
combustion engine arrangement for use with
constructio
