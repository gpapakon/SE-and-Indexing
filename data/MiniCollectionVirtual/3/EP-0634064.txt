<ABSTRACT>
A MOSFET (50, 51) control topology and a physical structure for a motor control which provide a more efficient and economic DC motor control are disclosed. The control topology introduces a synchronous-rectification technique wherein free-wheel diodes are replaced with MOSFET (50, 51) devices that are switched on and off by a logic circuit (38) so that they are conductive for commuting motor current during periods that the motor (24) current supply is switched off. The physical structure and method of assembling a DC motor control (33) eliminate time consuming assembly techniques while ensuring effective waste heat exchange between electronic components (46, 50, 51) and a heat sink (96) of the control (33) by providing quick-install spring retainers (110) for urging the components (46, 50, 51) into heat conducting contact with the heat sink (96). The physical structure also provides for high density packing of electronic components (46, 50, 51) in the control (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to direct current motor control 
systems used in controlling the rotational speed of traction motors 
for battery-powered vehicles and, in particular, to a novel DC motor 
control topology and structure. The control systems which currently dominate the battery-powered 
direct current motor market fall into two principal categories, 
control systems which use silicon controlled rectifiers and those 
which use metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors for 
switching DC current to control motor speed. Silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) are commonly employed in 
heavy equipment control devices for providing a variable mark-space 
ratio power regulator responsive to a motor current command signal. 
SCR controllers have been widely accepted and are proven to be 
reliable in most operating conditions. SCR controllers do have 
disadvantages, however. SCR controllers are physically bulky and 
massive. They also are known to dissipate substantial amounts of 
energy and they are not well suited for automated assembly 
techniques. In addition, although SCR devices are readily switched 
on extra commutation circuity is required to switch them off. A 
further problem with SCR controllers is that the commutation 
frequency of those controllers is in the audible range, commonly at 
2000 Hz or less. During operation, SCR controllers therefore tend to 
emit an audible hum and a poorly designed SCR controller can emit 
noise which humans find irritating and fatiguing. More recently, metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor 
(MOSFET) controllers have been invented. Such controllers are 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,626,750 which issued December 2, 1986 to 
Curtis Instruments.  
 In these controllers silicon controlled rectifiers are replaced 
with a plurality of MOSFETS for switching battery current in an on-off pulse to vary 
the current to the drive motor, thereby varying the motor torque and 
consequently the motor's rotational speed. MOSFETs are advantageous 
because they have a high input impedance, low energy dissipation and 
are readily switched from a conductive to a nonconductive state 
without additional circuitry. MOSFETs are also advantageous because 
they are small devices that are well suited for use with automated 
assembly techniques. They are further advantageous because the per 
unit cost of the device is rapidly decreasing as a result of 
utilization in a wide range of consumer, industrial and automotive 
applications. MOSFETs are also switchable at
