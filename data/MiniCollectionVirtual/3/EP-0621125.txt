<ABSTRACT>
Intelligent tray shaper, which has a motorized and demountable introductor 
assembly which acts as a supply device situated on the lower part of the 

machine in order to allow a rapid and easy supply by the operator, which can 
peform the operation even seated, while on the other hand the machine is 

provided with a display with an arm (7) and a 180
ยบ
 rotatable cabin (8) 
in such a way that all the controls of the machine are installed in the cabin. 

All the axes are monosyntonized with measurement and size changes with 
selectors with mechanization of all movements in a memory block. The machine 

has glue injectors with automatic displacement, both in hight and length, 
alowing the application of the same in a more suitable form with respect to 

different sizes of tray.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention, as indicated in its title, 
relates to a shaper of trays in different dimensions, be 
it in length, in width or in hight in which either the 
dimensions of the sheet or those of the shaping may be 
memorized giving a name or a number for each measurement 
of tray. A so called intelligent tray shaper is ment in 
the sense that every data which it is asked for in 
relation to the configuration, that is, the size of the 
different types of boxes which can be manufactured remain 
in its memory. Said parameters can be introduced for each type 
of tray by adjusting manually the machine in all its 
movements, by means of levers installed on the control 
panel, which control all the motors of the axes of the 
manual system. Said levers are equipped with the adequate 
symbology in order to avoid errors of positioning and make 
easier the operation by a non-expert operator. A program is included in the machine in order to 
introduce data on the length and the form of the sheet and 
the length an the form of the box formed, the length of 
the cords and the points where glue is to be applied. After having adjusted the machine for the tray 
proposed, the data is stored in the memory or the data 
storage and a name or a number is given to the same, and 
at any time which said measurements of tray are required 
to be mounted, the name or the number assigned to the same 
will be called; in such a moment all the motors will 
adjust the guiding axes, carrying out the introduction and  
 
the application of glue with no error or effort from the 
operator. It is also possible to introduce the data by a 
more experienced personnel, introducing the real 
measurements of thre sheet and the size of the tray 
shaped, with which the machine is adjusted automatically 
to the programmed measurements, said measurements will 
also be introduced in the memory as discussed in the 
previous case. With this new system time is saved as to the 
changing of measurements and the efforts of the operator, 
which is an enormous saving in comparison with the 
existing machines at present, in which said adjustments 
are carried out manually by means of handles and screws 
and for each measurement the same operation has to be 
repeated. All the exisiting machines at present with 
similar purposes have an adjustable sheet pile around the 
center of traction of the storage which is fixed, having 
the drawback that there aretoo many parts to be moved 
around said center. In the machine of the present invention said 
center is

<CLAIMS>
1.- Intelligent tray shaper which shapes trays of 
different dimensions of either length or width or hight, 

characterized in a control panel situated on a 180ยบ 
rotatable cabin which makes it possible to be placed on 

the back part for normal operation of the machine or on 
thefront part for adjusting the shaping. 
2.- Intelligent tray shaper, according to the 
previous claim, characterized in that the dimensions of 

the sheet or the shaping may be memorized, giving them a 
name or a number as parameters for each measurement of the 

tray such that said parameters, for each type of tray, may 
be introduced by manually adjusting the machine in all its 

movements by means of levers situated on the control 
panel, said levers control all the motors of the axes of 

the manual system, and that said levers are provided with 
the apropriate symbology in order to avoid errors of 

positioning and make easier the handling by a non-expert 
operator. 
3.- Intelligent tray shaper, according to the 
previous claims, characterized in that once the machine is 

adjusted to the desired tray, this will be stored in the 
memory and at any time which it is necessary to install 

said measurement of the tray, the indicated name or number 
will be called, in such a moment all the motors adjust 

their guiding axes. 
4.- Intelligent tray shaper, according to the 
previous claims, characterized in that by introducing the 

real measurements of the sheet and the size of the shaped 
tray the machine is automatically adjusted to the 

 
programmed means, which are also introduced in the memory. 
5.- Intelligent tray shaper, according to claim one, 
characterized in that the center of traction of the 

storage is demounted with the introductor with which the 
front limit or fixed panorama and the center of traction 

of the storage change according to the size of the sheet. 
6.- Intelligent tray shaper, characterized in that 
the application system is a mixture of HOLT-MET and vinyl 

with base of water.
