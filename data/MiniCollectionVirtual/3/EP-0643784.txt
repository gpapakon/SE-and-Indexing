<DESCRIPTION>
Process for fixation of dyes containing at least one polymerisable double bond by means of UV lightThe invention relates to a process for the fixation of dyes containing at least one polymerisable double bond on organic materials by irradiation with UV light in the presence of colourless polymerisable compounds and photoinitiators.According to conventional methods, the fibre materials, for example woven fabrics, knitted fabrics, felt-like materials and others treated with the dyes are in practice in many cases subjected to a plurality of further operations in which the absorbed dye is usually fixed on the substrate by means of heat, using expensive steaming machines which take up a lot of space. The literature discloses dyeing methods which use nonionic colourless compounds containing at least one polymerisable double bond in dye application and effect the subsequent fixation of the dye by means of ionising electron beams.These fixation methods still require fairly complicated equipment and furthermore leave something to be desired with respect to fixation yield, which has an adverse effect on the ecological balance.The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the fixation of dyes containing at least one polymerisable double bond.Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the dyeing or printing of organic material, in particular fibre material, which comprises applying dyes containing at least one polymerisable double bond together with at least one colourless cationic compound containing at least one polymerisable double bond and, if desired, one or more colourless nonionic compounds containing at least one polymerisable double bond, and at least one photoinitiator, and, if desired, further auxiliaries to the organic material, in particular fibre material, and then fixing them by means of UV light. The process according to the invention is distinguished by high degrees of fixation and makes it possible to replace the steaming machines which require high costs and a lot of space by simple UV irradiation units. Compared with conventional methods, the use of fixing alkali 

can be omitted, so that complete fixation of the dye takes place without the need for subsequent rinsing or washing.Suitable dyes are water-soluble and water-insoluble dyes carrying one polymerisable double bond. This polymerisable group can also be linked to the chromophore via a bridging member, for example a -(CH2-CH2-O)n- group.Water-soluble dyes are understood to mean in particular
