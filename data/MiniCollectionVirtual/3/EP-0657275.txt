A fluted roll according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the feed of
the heating agent of the heating installation into the flow lines (68) and out

of the return lines (69) takes place in common in the vicinity of an end (18)
of the fluted roll (2) via feeding lines and feeding-out lines (72, 85) located

coaxially one in another and via flow and return channels (75, 83), starting
radially from these lines, in the roll flange (20).
A fluted roll according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the flow channels
(75) in the roll flange (20) open into a circumferential annular distribution

groove (76) for the heating agent in the peripheral surface (77) of the retaming 
pin (74) of the roll flange (20), from which annular distribution

groove (76) radial through channels (79) lead to the flow lines (68).
A fluted roll according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the
transport channels (66) are formed as bores passing through the entire roll

shell (13) parallel to the axis of rotation (3) of the fluted roll (2), the open
ends of which bores are closed by plugs (67).
A fluted roll according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the
air exhaust channels (27), in dependence on the position of rotation of the

fluted roll (2), are connectable with a vacuum source for a pressure reservoir
