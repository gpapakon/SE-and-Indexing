<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alloy sheet for making a 
shadow mask having high press-formability and a method of 
manufacturing the same. A recent trend of up-grading color television to high 
definition TV has employed Fe-Ni alloy containing 34 to 38wt.% 
Ni as the alloy for making a shadow mask to suppress color-phase 
shift. Compared with low carbon steel which has long 
been used as a shadow mask material, conventional Fe-Ni alloy 
has a considerably lower thermal expansion coefficient. 
Accordingly, a shadow mask made of conventional Fe-Ni alloy 
raises no problem of color-phase shift coming from the thermal 
expansion of the shadow mask even when an electron beam heats 
the shadow mask. Common practice in making alloy sheets for shadow 
masks includes the following steps. An alloy ingot is prepared by 
a continuous casting process or ingot-making process. The alloy 
ingot is subjected to slabbing, hot-rolling, cold-rolling, and 
annealing to form an alloy sheet.  
 The alloy sheet for the shadow mask is then usually processed 
in the following steps to form a shadow mask. (1) The alloy sheet is 
photo-etched to form passage-holes for the electron beam on the 
alloy sheet for the shadow mask. A thin alloy sheet for a shadow 
mask which has been perforated by etching is hereinafter referred to as a "flat mask". 
(2) The flat mask is subjected to annealing. (3) The annealed flat 
mask is pressed into the curved shape of a cathode ray tube. (4) The 
press-formed flat mask is assembled to form a shadow mask, which is 
then subjected to blackening treatment. A shadow mask which is prepared by cold-rolling, 
recrystallization annealing, or by further slight finishing rolling 
after recrystallization annealing, has greater strength than 
conventional low carbon steel. Accordingly, such a conventional 
Fe-Ni alloy is subjected to softening-annealing (annealing before 
press-forming) at a temperature of 800°C or more before press-forming 
to make the grains of which it is composed coarse. After the softening-annealing, a 
warm-press is applied to carry out spheroidal forming. A temperature 
of 800°C or more is, however, in the high temperature region. 
Therefore, from the viewpoint of work efficiency and economy, 
the development of a manufacturing method to obtain as low 
a strength as in a material which has been softening-annealed at 800°C 
or more, by softening-annealing at 800°C or less has been 
a waited. Responding to this desire, a prior art proposal was made in JP-A-H3-267320
