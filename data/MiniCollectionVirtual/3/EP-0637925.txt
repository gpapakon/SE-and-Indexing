<ABSTRACT>
A display case (10) having lenses (36) mounted in the case (10) that distribute or direct light emitted by fluorescent tubes (35) located near the ends of display shelves (20) toward the shelves (20) in order to provide a more uniform light distribution along the length of the shelves (20). The lenses (36) facilitate the illumination of items (18) placed on the shelves (20) near the front and middle of the shelves (20). Light-directing portions (40) of the lenses (36) distribute or direct light emitted from the fluorescent tubes (34) located inside the lenses (36) toward the display case shelves (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of this application is related to
the subject matter of copending application, filed with the
present application, entitled "DISPLAY CASE WITH SHAPED
LIGHTED SHELVES," assigned to Anthony's Manufacturing
Company, Inc., the assignee of the present application.The present invention relates generally to lighted
display cases, and more particularly to display cases
having light sources that direct light toward the display
case shelves.In the past, a variety of shelves have been used
inside display cases for the purpose of displaying different
items in supermarkets, or other retail establishments.
Items for sale are typically placed on top of the shelves
in rows or columns. For example, dairy products in a
supermarket may be placed on shelves inside a refrigerated
display case with the older dairy products, which need to
be sold first, located near the front and middle of the
shelves where the products may be easily picked up by
customers. However, problems are encountered in lighting
such products.Products located near the middle of display shelves
are difficult to light when vertical, fluorescent tubes or
other lights located near the ends of the shelves are used
to light or illuminate the interior of a display case. In
such a case, the products located near the lights receive
more light or illumination than products located near the
front and middle of the shelves. As a result, products
near the middle of the shelves are insufficiently illuminated. FR-A-2654602 discloses a display structure
comprising four square-section upright columns defining
four corners of the structure and supporting, between them,
a plurality of display shelves. The square-section columns
are hollow and accommodate longitudinally extending light
sources such as fluorescent tubes. The square-section
columns are cut away over their innermost corners to allow
light to pass from the light sources to the shelves
supported between the columns.EP-A-0198088 discloses the use of elongate light
control lenses upon fluorescent light tubes to control the
flux of light from the fluorescent tubes to have a
predetermined distribution of light flux, for example a
uniform distributed luminous flux.It is an object of this invention to provide an
improved display case.According to the invention, there is provided a
display case used for displaying items, having a
surrounding frame and shelves mounted inside the display
case, and a light source mounted near one end of at least
one of said shelves, characterized in that the display

<CLAIMS>
A display case (10) used for displaying items (18),
having a surrounding frame and shelves (20) mounted inside

the display case, and a light source (34) mounted near one
end of at least one of said shelves, characterized in that

the display case further includes means (36) mounted inside
said display case and about the light source adjacent one

shelf to direct light emitted from the light source toward
the shelf in order to provide a more uniform light

distribution over the shelf than would exist without said
means.
The display case of claim 1 wherein the means for
directing light comprises a lens (36).
The display case of claim 2 wherein the light
source is a fluorescent lamp (34).
The display case of claim 3 wherein the fluorescent
lamp extends longitudinally and wherein the lens includes

a light-directing portion (40) having a focal point (54)
that is substantially coaxial with a longitudinal axis of

said fluorescent lamp.
The display case of claim 4 wherein the light
directing portion directs light into a beam (38) of

substantially parallel light rays.
The display case of claim 2 wherein the shelf has
a front edge with front end corners and wherein the case

has light sources located near both front end corners of
said shelf. 
The display case of claim 6 wherein each light
source includes an associated lens and wherein at least one

of the light sources has a lens which includes two
light-directing portions (40) and each of said

light-directing portions has a focal point (54) that is
substantially coaxial with a longitudinal axis of said

light source.
The display case of claim 2 wherein said lens is
plastic and flexible and said light-directing portions (78)

have end portions that releasibly engage apertures in the
frame.
The display case of claim 8 wherein the lens
provides a substantially uniform light distribution across

the shelf.
The display case of claim 2 wherein the lens is
spaced from the surface of the light source.
The display case of claim 10 wherein the light
source is spaced from the frame and the lens spacing from

the light source provides an air space around the entire
circumference of the light source.
The display case of claim 10 further comprising a
reflector (66) on a side of the light source different from

the lens side and wherein the light from the light source
is reflected by the reflector (66) toward the lens.
The display case of claim 12 wherein the reflector
includes two reflector portions for reflecting light from

the light source to opposite sides of the light source. 
The display case of claim 2 further comprising a
reflector (68) mounted on the lens between the lens and 
the
light source.
The display case of either of claims 1 - 9 further
including reflectors (66, 100) for additionally directing

light towards the shelf.
The display case of either of claims 1 - 14 wherein
the light sources are mounted on the surrounding frame.
The display case of either of claims 1 - 14 wherein
the shelves are multiple shelves with at least one shelf

positioned above a second shelf, wherein the light source
includes at least first and second light sources, the first

light source positioned in the display case adjacent a
first front corner of the first and second shelves, at

least the second light source positioned adjacent a second
front corner of the at least first and second shelves, and

wherein the at least first and second light sources extend
vertically.
The display case of claim 17 wherein the reflector
includes at least first and second planar portions oriented

at angles with respect to each other.
The display case of claim 18 wherein the means for
directing light includes enlarged end portions (78)

elongated in a longitudinal direction for mounting the
light directing means to the display case.
The display case of claim 17 including first and
second reflectors oriented on opposite sides of the light

source from each other.
