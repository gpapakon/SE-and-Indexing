<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vending machines. Vending machines presently available generally allow only a 
single vendor to purchase any item at any one time and if more than one 
vending position is required a corresponding number of vending machines 
must be provided. One problem associated with this approach is that 
vending machines are usually provided in public locations e.g. on 
railways stations, bus stations and on streets, where space is at a 
premium and a large number of vending machines provide an obstruction. 
This is particularly disadvantageous in railways stations and bus 
stations where evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency 
require the number of obstructions to be kept to a minimum. A further problem with vending machines is the limited number of 
items that can be dispensed from any one machine. US-A-3 129 039 discloses a vending machine 
according to the preamble of claim 1. The present invention is designed to overcome the above problems 
by providing a vending machine that can be used by two or more people 
simultaneously to purchase products. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a 
vending machine as defined in the accompanying claims.  
 The present invention will be described in further detail with 
reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a side elevation of a vending machine in accordance 
with the present invention, Figure 2 is a horizontal section taken through the vending 
machine along the line 2-2 shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a vertical section taken through the vending machine 
along the line 3-3 shown in Figure 2, and Figure 4 is a horizontal section taken through a further 
embodiment of the present invention. The vending machine shown in Figures 1 to 3 is generally circular 
in plan (although other shapes are, of course, possible) and includes 
four vending positions 10 at which a purchaser can select and pay for 
the product that he wants to purchase, and receive the product, as will 
be described in greater detail below. The diameter of the machine may 
be about 2m but larger or smaller diameters can of course be used. Referring to Figures 2 and 3, a cylindrical inner wall 12 
supports eleven (or any other appropriate number) static shelves fixed 
to the central wall 12; instead of static shelves, eleven sets of 
radially-extending brackets 14 may be used, each set being at a 
different level within the machine. As shown in Figure 2, each shelf 14 
includes twelve pairs of roller bearings 16 extending

carousel carries a bar code at each location, each bar code being 

associated with the product in that location, and the machine includes 
a bar code reader capable of reading the codes and transmitting 

information from the codes to the control means to indicate which 
product is opposite the delivery means of each vending position.
