<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed of reprocessing lead-containing materials in which simple and complex metal sulphates and oxides, 
including higher oxides of iron, predominate, examples of such materials being the sludges and dust obtained during the 

conversion of mattes and similar materials. The raw material is mixed with fluxes, and sulphide or carbon-containing 
material in powder form is added, the moisture content of the resulting charge being approximately 2-16 

%. The charge is 
dried and mixed with reversible oxidized powders and crushed carbon-containing 

material and then fused in suspension in an 
oxygen atmosphere. During the fusion process, the powder reduces the sulphate sulphur and the higher iron oxides and a low-melting 

point oxide melt is thus formed, while a heated layer is formed from the carbon-containing 
material under the flame. 

At the same time, the lead oxide is reduced within that layer to metal, while the zinc remains in the slag. The oxidized dust is 
removed from the gases produced by the fusion and returned to the melt. The powder material added to the charge can be 

either: sulphide (such as lead ore or low-grade concentrate), which is added to the charge until the weight ratio of the sulphur 
in sulphide, elemental and pyrite form to the total sulphur content of the charge is approximately 0.08-0.87; 

or a carbon-containing 
substance, with approximately 4-12 kg of pure carbon to every 100 kg of trivalent iron and approximately 20-140 

kg of pure carbon to every 100 kg of sulphate sulphur. A third possibility is to add the sulphide and carbon-containing 
substance simultaneously in the amounts indicated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nonferrous metallurgy
and, more particularly, to methods of processing lead-bearing
materials of different origin.The main task in the improvement of the processing of
lead-bearing materials also containing zinc, copper and other
valuable metals, is to develop methods of extracting the said
metals from raw materials with minimum specific output of a
process gas, and low consumption of energy carriers per 1 t of
lead metal. The other task is to provide a possibility to
treat both natural raw materials and lead-bearing materials
produced in other industrial processes as by-products, whose
storage is associated with great environmental hazards. The
said objectives are achieved with the use of process oxygen at
the step of smelting the lead-bearing materials that allows
the energy expenditures in lead production to be decreased,
and the output of process gas to be reduced. Such methods have
the common advantage of allowing a raw material comparatively
poor in lead content to efficiently undergo smelting thereby
producing a gas rich in sulphurous anhydride content and a
molten lead-containing slag from which the lead bullion can be
produced by reduction. A variety of such methods being called
autogenous is known. These methods allow raw materials of a
varying range of quality to be processed. However this range
is rather narrow (in terms of lead and zinc content, thermal
properties of materials, size and phase composition of products).
This is why at present a large group of lead-bearing
materials such as residues, flue dusts from copper matte conversion,
slurries, are not processed by known methods and pile
up in dumps. Thus, as the afore-mentioned materials contain
significant amounts of zinc and copper, non-ferrous metals accumulate
in dumps, causing complicated environmental problems.
Consequently, extending the range of processable lead-bearing
material is a very urgent task for technology and environmental
protection. A method, of processing the fine-grain lead concentrates
in admixture with recycle dust, fluxes, coal powder, and lead-containing
materials such as residues, is known as QSL-process
(K.Mager, A.Schelte, "Primary and Secondary Lead processing",
Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, August 20-24, 1989, Ed.Pergamon
Press, N.Y., pp.15-26). According to this method the mixture
is granulated, and the thus produced granules have a moisture
content of 8% are charged onto the surface of the oxide melt
where 35 to 60% of lead is present in the form of oxides. An
