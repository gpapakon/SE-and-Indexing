<ABSTRACT>
A system of measuring the densities of images on photographic films, 
comprising a conventional 

projection unit, in which a measuring device (7) is 
mounted slidably between the film (6) and the lens (9), 

capable of longitudinal movement in relation to the 
film and equipped with a plurality of light-transducing 

elements (74) arrayed in mutual alignment transversely 
to the image (I) and positioned to receive respective 

quantities of light from discrete portions (ZP) of a 
transverse reading zone (Z), which are admitted through 

a slot (72), reflected by a mirror (71) and focused by 
a lens (75). With the measuring device (7) translating 

longitudinally, such that the slot (72) can cover the 
image (I) progressively and in its entirety, the single 

values sensed by the light-transducing elements (74) 
are fed into an electronic processor (C) and processed 

together with other data in such a way as to determine 
the filtration and illumination parameters governing 

reproduction of the image (I).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optoelectronic 
system by which images recorded on photographic films 
are measured and processed in such a way as to optimize 
subsequent printing. The prior art embraces a variety of systems and devices 
for the analysis of photographic images on negative or 
positive films, of which use is made in effecting a 
suitable adjustment of the various parameters governing 
the photographic reproduction of such images. There are systems, for example, in which analysis of 
the image is effected using television cameras disposed 
laterally in relation to the image, preceding the lens 
through which the image is projected onto the paper, or 
suitable photoelectronic sensors similarly disposed and 
wired to an electronic processor programmed to adjust 
the parameters governing reproduction with the end in 
view of obtaining as true a printed image as possible. Such systems tend in general to be somewhat costly, 
especially those using television cameras; moreover, 
the particular positioning of the means which read the  
 
image will normally dictate not only a reduction in 
sensitivity, but also an imperfect view by reason of 
the lateral positioning. Certain other conventional systems are characterized by 
even greater complexity and cost, namely those in which 
the lens is displaced to allow measurement of the image 
axially, utilizing analysis devices or suitable mirrors 
or other systems of relaying the image which are moved 
into the position occupied previously by the lens. In one conventional system worthy of mention, the film 
is translated through a measuring station before being 
positioned at the projecting station, and exposed to an 
auxiliary light, or to light emitted by the projection 
apparatus itself and suitably diverted, which passes 
through the film and falls on a fixed device by which 
the resulting image values are relayed to an electronic 
processor; on the basis of internally programmed data, 
the processor then pilots the insertion of filters 
between the light source and the image projection 
system, as well as adjusting the illumination, so as to 
ensure adaptation to the density of the original film 
image and that of the photographic paper on which it is 
printed. Such a system thus allows essentially of improving the 
quality of copies in relation to an original image,  
 
especially in the case of flash or backlit pictures, 
albeit the reading on which the analysis of the image 
is based must be effected with the film in movement, so 
that this

A system of measuring images on photographic films 
to ensure their correct reproduction, utilizing a unit 

for the projection of images from film onto sheets of 
light-sensitive paper in the production of photographs, 

of the type widely employed in photographic printing 
machines, which comprises a light source consisting in 

a projection lamp (1) positioned within a parabolic 
reflector (2), a heat filter (3) associated with the 

reflector, a set of colour filters (4), a condenser 
(5), a support (61) in which to position the film (6) 

bearing an image (I) for reproduction, a lens (9) with 
a relative shutter, and a printing surface (S) on which 

to position the sheet of light-sensitive paper (P) 
destined to receive the projected image (I), all of 

which conventional in embodiment, 
characterized 


in that it envisages the use of a measuring device (7) 
mounted below the level of the film (6) bearing the 

image (I) for reproduction and above the level of the 
lens (9), consisting in a hollow element (70) embodied 

with a slot (72) disposed transversely to the image, 
capable of sliding longitudinally in relation to the 

image (I) of the film (6) and accommodating a plurality 
of light-transducing elements (74) arrayed in mutual 

 
alignment transversely to the image (I), which are 

connected to an electronic processor (C) and in receipt 
of respective quantities of light, admitted through the 

slot (72), from discrete portions (ZP) of a transverse 
zone (Z) corresponding to the full width of the image 

(I) compassed by the slot (72); 
in that the measuring device (7) is invested with 
translatory motion in the longitudinal direction of the 

image (I) by suitable means of conventional embodiment 
in such a way that the slot (72) passes from the edge 

of the image (I) at which the measurement commences to 
the opposite edge, and is then returned to the initial 

position, remaining outside the dimensional compass of 
the beam from the image (I) which can thus be projected 

onto the sheet of light-sensitive paper (P); 
in that the light-transducing elements (74) are caused 
by the electronic processor (C) to respond in sequence 

beginning with a first element (74) at one end of the 
array and terminating with that at the opposite end, in 

such a way as to effect a photometric measurement of 
one corresponding transverse zone (Z), the selfsame 

sequence being repeated at predetermined and identical 
intervals of time simultaneously with the longitudinal 

translatory motion of the measuring device (7) in such 
a way as to scan the image (I) in its entirety; and 
in that the single signals generated and relayed by 
the light-transducing elements (74) to the electronic 

processor (C) are processed by a software program 
together with other parametric data in such a way as 

will allow the processor to pilot the selection of 
suitable colour filters and determine the appropriate 

illumination for the subsequent printing operation and 
thus optimize the reproduction of the image (I). 
A system as in claim 1, wherein the transmission of 
light from the image (I) through the slot (72) onto the 

array of light-transducing elements (74) is effected by 
lateral reflection through 90 , utilizing a mirror (73) 

angled at 45 or a comparable prism, in conjunction 
with one or more lenses (75) by which a corresponding 

discrete portion (ZP) within the transverse zone (Z) of 
the image (I) compassed by the slot (72) is focused 

onto each of the light-transducing elements (74). 
A system as in claim 2, wherein a plurality of 
spherical lenses (75), one to each light-transducing 

element (74), can be replaced by a single spherical 
lens or a single cylindrical lens. 
A system as in claim 1, wherein the transmission of 
light from the image (I) through the slot (72) onto the 

array of light-transducing elements (74) is effected by 
means of optical fibres. 
A system as in claim 1, wherein each of the single 
light-transducing elements (74) is embodied as a triple 

element composed of three distinct light-transducing 
elements, each filtered in a corresponding primary 

colour.
