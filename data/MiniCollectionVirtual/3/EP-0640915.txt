<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for efficiently presenting the contents 
of a container object within a graphical user interface on a 

display in a data processing system. The graphical user 
interface includes an existing display window area. A container 

object, which may be utilized as a graphical indication of the 
storage of multiple objects, is selected. An organized format 

for presenting contents of the specified container object is 
specified by a user. The contents of the selected container 

object are then presented in the specified organized format 
within the existing display window area in the graphical user 

interface on the display, without allocating an additional 
display window area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an improved 
graphical user interface in a data processing system and in 
particular to a method and system for efficiently presenting 
contents of a container object within a graphical user interface 
in a data processing system. Still more particularly, the 
present invention relates to a method and system for efficiently 
presenting contents of a container object in an organized format 
within an existing display window area within a graphical user 
interface in a data processing system. Data processing systems commonly utilize graphical user 
interfaces to enable users to interact with the data processing 
system and manipulate the activities and functions available to 
the users. Users may select, through the graphical user 
interface, to perform a particular activity utilizing input 
devices such as a keyboard or a "mouse." In a graphical user 
interface, activities such as "print document" or "select a 
document" may be represented to the user in the form of function 
keys graphically displayed on the computer display screen and 
selected by striking a particular key on the keyboard, or as 
icons to be selected utilizing a graphical pointing device such 
as a "mouse." A pointer, or mouse cursor, on the display screen 
is typically utilized to represent the current location of the 
"mouse." By moving the "mouse," a user may move the pointer, or 
mouse cursor, around within the computer display screen.  An object may be graphically represented to a user as an 
"icon" utilizing the graphical user interface. An object is an 
item which may be manipulated as a unit. Objects may be of three 
types: device, data, and container. A device object may be 
manipulated to perform a selected task such as typically 
performed utilizing a physical or logical device such as a 
printer, mouse, or facsimile machine. For example, a "printer" 
device object may be manipulated to print documents or text. 
Data objects may include documents or text, such as created 
utilizing word processing applications. Container objects are 
typically objects into which other objects may be stored. 
Therefore, objects may be stored together in a container object 
and manipulated as a unit by manipulating the container object. Container objects, commonly called "folders," are typically 
provided as part of a graphical user interface. These "folders" 
may be iconically represented as a traditional filing folder and 
may be utilized to group, or "store," other objects in a way 
which is
