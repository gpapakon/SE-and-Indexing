<ABSTRACT>
The current source device has a current source supplying a pair of exclusive=OR parallel transistors (S1,S2). The current source comprises a regulated cascade stage (P1,P2,P3,N1). The first transistor (P1) is controlled by a bias voltage (B1) and the control input of the second transistor (P2) is coupled to the output of a regulating transistor (P3). The control input of the latter is coupled to a junction (K1) between the first two transistors. The cascade transistors and the regulating transistors are of p-channel type, the parallel transistors being of n-channel type.

Current source arrangement having a current 
source which feeds two non-equivalently controlled 

transistors which are connected in parallel, characterized 
in that the current source (P1, P2, P3, N1) is 

designed as a regulated cascode stage whose first transistor 
(P1) is controlled by a bias voltage (B1) and 

whose second transistor (P2) is connected at its input to 
the output of a regulating transistor (P3) which, on the 

input side, is connected to the junction point (K1) 
between the first and second transistors. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the current source transistors (P1, P2) and the 

regulating transistor (P3) are each of the p-channel 
type, and the transistors (S1, S2) which are connected in 

parallel are each of the n-channel type. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the regulating transistor (P3) is fed by a 

current source (N1; P4, N2, N3). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that one transistor (N3) of a current 

mirror (N2, N3) is connected in series with the regulating 
transistors (P3), the other transistor (N2) of which 

current mirror is connected in series with a further 
transistor (P4) which is controlled by the bias voltage 

(B1). 
Arrangement according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a capacitor (TC) is connected 

in parallel with the transistors (S1, S2) which 
are connected in parallel.  

 
Arrangement according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the transistors (S1, S2) 

which are connected in parallel have different transistor 
geometries.

one of the preceding claims in a digital-to-analog 

converter.
