<ABSTRACT>
For use in a trip unit, a switched current shunting arrangement in a circuit interruption tripping system couples the current transformers (A, B, C, G, F) to relatively low voltage and it accumulates a high level of energy quickly at power-up so that the tripping solenoid (128) can promptly be energized after the detection of a spurious fault condition. The arrangement regulates supply current from the current transformers to a trip voltage capacitor (78) and to a supply capacitor (20') at the input of a voltage regulation circuit. The current transformer charges the trip voltage capacitor to a first prescribed voltage level, and a current shunting circuit (142, 144) shunts current passing from the current transformer to the supply capacitor, such that during normal operation the supply capacitor is charged to a second prescribed voltage level, which is less than the first prescribed voltage level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a trip unit power supply comprising a trip voltage capacitor. Such an apparatus is known from EP-A-0 136 254. Solid state current regulators are commonly used in 
conjunction with power supplies to protect electrical 
circuits and devices coupled thereto. Such regulators 
are commonly use in circuit interruption tripping systems 
for 3-phase power lines. In this application, a solid 
state current regulator controls the amount of current 
provided from the 3-phase power line to the system power 
supply. As the magnitude of the power in the line 
increases beyond a prescribed limit, the current 
regulator responds by shunting excess current from the 
line to system ground.  
 Known current regulators may be categorized as being 
either a linear shunt type regulator or a switched shunt 
type regulator. A typical linear shunt type regulator 
includes a resistor and zener diode arranged in series 
between the current line and ground with their 
interconnection controlling the base of a P-N-P 
Darlington transistor. When the current magnitude in the 
line exceeds the breakdown voltage of the zener diode, 
the Darlington transistor is enabled, and the excess 
current from the current line is shunted through the 
Darlington transistor to ground. This type of regulator 
is useful and desirable when the current level in the 
line is low. However, it consumes a significant amount 
of power, due to the regulated voltage across the 
transistor, when the current level in the line is high. 
In applications where significant levels of heat cannot 
be dissipated or where space or cost does not accommodate 
heat sinking devices, this type of shunting arrangement 
is unacceptable. Switched current shunting arrangements typically 
involve a more complex arrangement of circuitry to enable 
the current path to be shunted from the line to ground. 
For example, in U.S. Patent 4,809,125, by Matsko et al., 
a power supply circuit employs a custom design IC 
(integrated circuit) for monitoring the current level of 
the line and controlling the bias on a transistor which 
is selectively enabled to shunt excess current from the 
line to ground. Another known type of switched current 
shunting arrangement employs a comparator and a voltage 
divider circuit at an input of the comparator for 
determining when to enable a transistor which shunts the 
excess current from the line to ground. While switched current shunting arrangements may be 
controlled so that they do not exhibit the heat 
dissipation problem
