<ABSTRACT>
A liquid material dispenser for dispensing medicaments includes a housing (2) formed with a reservoir (4) for the liquid to be dispensed, an outlet (6) through which the liquid is to be dispensed, and a connecting passageway (8) between the reservoir (4) and the outlet (6). A diaphragm (12) is located in a cavity (10) in the passageway (8) such that one side of the diaphragm (12) defines a pumping chamber (10a), and the other side defines a control chamber (10b). An electrolytic cell (14) generates a gas which is fed to the control chamber (10b) according to the quantity of electrical current passed through the electrolyte (14c), for driving the diaphragm (12) through forward strokes to pump liquid to the outlet (6); and a slow-acting vent (20) vents the gas from the control chamber (10b) to the atmosphere at a rate lower than that of generation of gas by the electrolytic cell (14), for driving the diaphragm (12) through return strokes to refill the pumping chamber (10a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid material dispensers, and
particularly to dispensers for dispensing medicaments at small,
precisely-controlled rates. The invention is especially useful in a
dispenser including an electrolytic cell generating a gas in accordance
with the rate the liquid is to be dispensed, such as described in prior
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,062,834 and 5,090,963, and it is therefore described
below particularly with respect to such a dispenser.There are many applications, such us drug delivery systems,
requiring the dispensing or delivering of a liquid at a predetermined
precisely-controlled rate. Electrolytic pumps, such as described in the
above U.S. Patents, have been developed for this purpose. These
pumps, however, generally include relatively large pumping chambers,
and therefore their pumping rates may be significantly influenced by
pressure and temperature changes particularly when the dispenser is
used over long periods of time and/or under varying ambient
conditions.It would therefore be desirable to provide a liquid material
dispenser or pump of a construction which may include a pumping
chamber of relatively small volume so that the rate of delivery of the
liquid is less sensitive to pressure and temperature changes. U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,687,423 discloses a drug dispenser
comprising a pump which pumps the drug from a fluid reservoir to an
outlet. A reciprocatable pumping member is located in a passageway
between the reservoir and the outlet to define a pumping chamber on
one side and a pressure-control chamber on the other side. Valves
which are provided in the passageway cause the pumping member, when
reciprocated through a pumping cycle, to draw liquid from the
reservoir into the pumping chamber during one stroke of the cycle, and
to pump liquid from the pumping chamber to the outlet during the other
stroke of the cycle. Reciprocation is caused by an electrochemical cell,
which pumps oxygen into the pressure-control chamber and thereby
moves the pumping member through one stroke of the cycle as the
pressure increases, and a snap valve which opens when a predetermined
pressure has been reached to thereby vent the chamber. When the
chamber is vented the pumping member returns to its starting position. According to the present invention, there is provided a liquid
material dispenser, comprising: 
a housing including a reservoir for liquid to be dispensed,
an outlet through which the liquid is dispensed, and a connecting
passageway between said reservoir and said
