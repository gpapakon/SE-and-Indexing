<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of
chlorine dioxide and the processing of acidic byproducts
of such production.In U.S. Patent No. 4,081,520, assigned to the
assignee hereof and the disclosure of which is
incorporated herein by reference, there is described a
process for the production of chlorine dioxide at high
efficiency using sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid and
methanol. The reaction medium from which the chlorine
dioxide is formed is maintained at its boiling point,
generally in the range of about 50° to about 85°C, under
a subatmospheric pressure. The evaporated water serves
to dilute the chlorine dioxide for removal from the
reaction zone.The mechanism of reaction is thought to be that
chlorine, coproduced with the chlorine dioxide, is
reduced by the methanol to chloride ions, which then
react with the sodium chlorate. The reaction medium
generally has a total acid normality greater than about
4.5 normal, which results in the formation of a sodium
acid sulfate, usually sodium sesquisulfate, which
precipitates from the reaction medium, after becoming
saturated with the salt following start-up. The process
equation may be represented as:
3NaClO3 + 2H2SO4 + 0.85CH3OH → 3ClO2 + Na3H(SO4)2
+ H2O + 0.05CH3OH + 0.6HCOOH + 0.2CO2
This process is highly efficient in terms of the
conversion of chlorate ions to chlorine dioxide and
efficiencies well in excess of 90% can be achieved. The
chlorine dioxide which results is virtually
uncontaminated by chlorine, which is highly beneficial 
in the modern pulp mill environment. The process
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,081,520 has been widely
adopted commercially and is known as the "R8" process.As noted above, the by-product of this process is a
sodium acid sulfate. This material may be used, as is,
in the pulp mill as a make-up chemical for sulfur values
lost from the mill. However, with the considerable
tightening of the pulp mill environment in recent years,
such sulfur losses have been significantly decreased, so
that the requirement for make-up sodium sulfate also has
declined to the stage where the material is an unwanted
by-product.Owing to the acidic nature of the by-product,
sodium sesquisulfate cannot readily be disposed of in
that form, requiring neutralization of the acid values
prior to disposal. With the trend towards higher
chlorine dioxide substitution for chlorine in many
mills, the necessity to neutralize increasing quantities
of sodium sesquisulfate may result in an imbalance of
caustic and chlorine within the mill. The caustic
