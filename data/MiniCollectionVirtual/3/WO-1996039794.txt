<ABSTRACT>
A novel type of power supply for AC discharge by which the discharge is easily performed even when insulators adhere to electrodes or the gas pressure drops and variation of plasma parameters with time is very small. A power divider (2) divides a signal from a master oscillator (1) into a plurality of signals and phase shifters (3) and power amplifiers (4) respectively determine the phases and amplitudes of the divided signals. A controller (7) controls and adjusts the oscillation frequency, and the phases and amplitudes of the divided signals. The final outputs are produced through transformers (5) and fed to a plurality of electrodes (6) arranged in a discharge enclosure. The transformers (5) are connected to each other on the output side by one of their outputs which are normally maintained at a floating potential, and discharge is made to take place between the electrodes (6). The phases and amplitudes of the electrodes (6) are arbitrary and may be the same respectively. The phases are controlled and the amplitudes are adjusted most appropriately to the controlled system. In addition, the shapes and arrangement of the electrodes (6) are also arbitrary and made appropriate to the system.
