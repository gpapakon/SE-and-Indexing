<ABSTRACT>
A crystallisable polymer is used which has a distribution of molecular weights such that the ratio between its weight-average molecular weight and its number-average molecular weight is at least equal to 10. During its extrusion, the molten polymer is subjected to biaxial drawing at a substantially constant drawing rate by passing through a divergent annular die having a hyperbolic profile, the molten polymer penetrating the said die being thermally conditioned beforehand to a temperature greater than its melting temperature but less than its temperature of crystallization under the biaxial drawing induced by the said die, the melting and crystallisation temperatures being determined for the value of the pressure prevailing at the inlet of the divergent annular die, and then the biaxially oriented structure thus produced is subjected to rapid cooling in order to bring its temperature to a temperature below its crystallization point at atmospheric pressure, this cooling being carried out, in the absence of deformation, by the structure passing through a subsequent annular straight die section so as to perfect the crystallisation induced during the biaxial drawing.

Process for the direct continuous extrusion of 
biaxially oriented tubular structures made of crystallizable 

polymers, which includes the following steps: 

a crystallizable polymer, having a molecular 
weight distribution such that the ratio between its 

weight-average molecular weight and its number-average 
molecular weight is at least equal to 10, is processed by 

extrusion; 
during its extrusion, the said molten polymer is 
subjected to biaxial drawing at a substantially constant 

draw rate by passing through a divergent annular die of 
hyperbolic profile, the molten polymer penetrating the 

said die being thermally conditioned beforehand at a temperature 
above its melting temperature but below its 

crystallization temperature under the biaxial drawing 
induced by the said die, the melting and crystallization 

temperatures being determined for the value of pressure 
existing at the inlet of the divergent annular die, 
next, the biaxially oriented structure thus 
produced is subjected to rapid cooling in order to bring 

its temperature to a temperature below its crystallization 
point at atmospheric pressure, this cooling being 

carried out, in the absence of deformation, by passing 
the structure through a subsequent annular straight die 

section so as to perfect the crystallization induced 
during the biaxial drawing. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the polymer is a polyolefin. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in  
 

that the polymer has a melt index under 21.6 kg of less 
than 10. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the polymer penetrating the divergent annular die is 

conditioned beforehand by being split up in concentric 
heat exchangers with narrow gaps arranged along the path 

of the polymer directly upstream of the divergent annular 
die. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the temperature of the divergent annular die is 

maintained at a temperature of 1 to 5Â°C above that of the 
polymer penetrating this die. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the walls of the die are rendered slippery by a 

prior treatment. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a lubricant is injected at various points in the 

die. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a polymer containing a lubricant is processed. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the tubular structure is open and shaped between 

two rolls which are thermally conditioned in order to 
make a sheet therefrom.
