<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a door-holding device (1) for vehicle doors, with a door-holding hinge (2) fastenable at one end in an articulated manner to a vehicle spar and with a holding part (8) to be fastened to the door. The holding hinge (2) and the holding part (8) are connected to one another so as to be relatively moveable via a catch device (10) defining specific pivoting positions of the vehicle door. The catch device (10) has, on the one hand, a strip-shaped catch rail (20) with catch recesses (24) formed on a first longitudinal edge (22) and, on the other hand, a catch roller (26) which is guided in a rolling manner via the first longitudinal edge (22) and cooperates with the catch recesses (24) and is loaded with a spring force (F) in the direction of the catch rail (20), the catch rail (20) being supported on an abutment (34) counter to the spring force (F) by means of its second longitudinal edge (32) located opposite the catch recesses (24) and the catch roller (26). The catch roller (26) is preferably an integral part of the holding part (8) located on the door, whilst the catch rail (20) at the same time forms the holding hinge (2).

(24) and the convex strip edge forming the second lengthwise edge (32) 

supported against the abutment (34). 
Door catch according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the latch roller (26) is mounted within a slot recess (42) of a 

plunger-like guide element (40) which is located in a manner moveable in the 
direction of the spring force (F) in a housing (36) of the retaining part (8) on the 

door, the latch rail (20) passing through the housing, and the guide element is 
subjected to the spring force (F), the latch rail (20) engaging, preferably in certain 

regions, with little lateral clearance in the slot recess (42) of the guide element 
(40). 
Door catch according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that the plunger-like guide element (40) is guided in the housing 

(36) in a manner secured against twisting by a cross-section differing from a 
circular shape, in particular being substantially rectangular. 
Door catch according to Claim 4 or 5,
 
characterised in that the guide element (40) in particular in the inside area of the 

slot recess (42) turned in each case towards the latch rail (20), has depressions 

(46) for receiving lubricating grease. 
Door catch according to one or more of Claims 4 to 6,
  
 

characterised in that a tensioned pressure spring (48) is located within the housing 
(36) between the guide element (40) and a housing wall (68) to create the spring 

force (F) acting on the latch roller (26). 
Door catch according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that the abutment (34) is formed by a support surface (50) on the 

housing side, in particular of a plastics insert (52). 
Door catch according to one or more of Claims 2 to 8,
 
characterised in that the latch rail (20) has, on its end which faces away from the 

attachment element (5) on the pillar and which is guided through the retaining 
part (8) on the door, an approximately hook-shaped limit-stop element (54) which 

interacts with the retaining part (8) on the door in a door-open position. 
Door catch according to Claim 9,
 
characterised in that the limit-stop element (54) comes to rest against the housing 

(36) of the retaining part (8) on the door in the door-open position, the housing 
(36) preferably having a convex stabilising bead (56) and the limit-stop element 

(54) having in particular a corresponding concave recess (58) for form-fittingly 
receiving the stabilising bead (56). 
Door catch according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10,
