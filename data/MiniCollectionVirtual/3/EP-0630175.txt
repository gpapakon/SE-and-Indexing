<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a cooling device for an electrical assembly (module) having at least one component which produces heat, the assembly (3) is fitted on one side of a cooling element (1) which is intrinsically in the form of a plate. The other side of the cooling element can be connected to a printed circuit board with the aid of solder spheres (4, 4', 8).

Cooling device for an electrical assembly having 
at least one heat-generating component, characterized in 

that the assembly (3) is fitted on one side of a cooling 
element (1) which intrinsically has the form of a plate, 

and in that the other side of the cooling element can be 
connected to a printed circuit board with the aid of 

solder balls (4, 4', 8). 
Cooling device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that parts (5', 6') of the cooling element which 

project beyond the assembly (3) are bent away, preferably 
at right angles to the surface which carries the assembly 

(3). 
Cooling device according to either of Claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that at least some of the solder 

balls (8) are electrically isolated from the cooling 
element (1) and are connected to conductors (7) which 

electrically connect terminals of the assembly (3) to the 
printed circuit board. 
Cooling device according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the conductors are arranged as conductor 

tracks (7) on a sheet (2), and in that the sheet (2) at 
least partially encloses the cooling element (1). 
Cooling device according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that terminals of the assembly (3) are directly 

connected to conductor tracks (7) on the sheet (2). 
Cooling device according to either of Claims 4 
and 5, characterized in that the sheet resting on one 

side of the cooling element allows at least part of the 
surface of the assembly to make direct contact with the  

 
cooling element. 
Cooling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that provision is made both of 

solder balls for the electrical connection of the conductor 
tracks to the printed circuit board and of solder 

balls for the direct thermal connection of the cooling 
element to the printed circuit board. 
Cooling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a whole-area copper layer 

is applied in the region of a plurality of solder balls 
(4'). 
Cooling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the assembly (3) is provided 

with a heat-conducting cap (10, 11), which is 
fitted on one side of the cooling element (1) with the 

aid of solder balls (12). 
Cooling device according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the cap is composed of a cap cover (10) and 

a cap ring (11). 
Cooling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the cooling element (1) is 

composed of copper. 
Cooling device according to one of Claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that the cooling element (1) is 

composed of aluminium and has a copper layer on the other 
side.
