<ABSTRACT>
There are provided polypropylene resin expanded 
particles which have a uniform bubble size, can be molded 

with an exceptionally low steam pressure, and can produce 
an expanded molded product having a good surface 

appearance and an excellent energy absorption property. 
The present particles are polypropylene resin expanded 

particles containing as a base resin an isotactic 
polypropylene resin polymerized in the presence of a 

metallocene polymerization catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polypropylene resin expanded particles or beads from which can be prepared an
expanded molded product having a uniform foam diameter, good moldability and surface appearance and excellent
physical properties, particularly energy absorption property. The expanded particles of the present invention are useful
for producing expanded molded products which are used for packaging containers, toys, automobile parts, core materials
for helmets, shock-absorbing packaging materials, and numerous other products.An expanded molded product obtained from polypropylene resin expanded particles has hitherto been used advantageously
as a core material for bumpers, a variety of packaging materials, and the like because they have excellent
chemical resistance, impact resistance, compression strain restoring ability, and other properties.As the polypropylene resin, a propylene-α-olefin random copolymer in which propylene is copolymerized with an
α-olefin such as ethylene or butene-1 is primarily used from the standpoint of its expanding property. The copolymer
comprises a product obtained by polymerization with a so-called Ziegler-Natta catalyst which is obtained from a titanium
chloride and an alkylaluminum.There has also been proposed an application of a polypropylene having a syndiotactic structure obtained by using
a metallocene catalyst as the base of an expanded product (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 224832/1992).
This proposal made possible the preparation of the expanded products of a propylene homopolymer which have not
been obtainable from a propylene homopolymer produced by the use of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst referred to above, but
the expanded product has an insufficient energy absorption property per unit weight in compression.Those expanded molded products obtained from the conventional polypropylene resin expanded particles have
not been always satisfactory, particularly, in their energy absorption property per unit weight in compression.On the other hand, in order to improve the energy absorption property, it is possible to use a method of increasing
the stiffness of a resin constituting a foam wall by controlling the comonomer content in a copolymer or by using a resin
such as a homopolymer as a base resin.However, this method, while obviously improving the energy absorption property of the expanded molded product,
has been known in the art to have a problem in that, when propylene homopolymers produced by the use of what is
called Ziegler-Natta catalyst are

<CLAIMS>
Polypropylene resin expanded particles comprising as a base resin an isotactic
propylene polymer obtained by the polymerization of a corresponding monomer or

monomers with a polymerization catalyst derived from a metallocene compound, said
polypropylene resin expanded particles having been produced by a process which

includes the steps of; dispersing the particles of the base resin in water in a closed
container, supplying a volatile expanding agent to the container, heating the

dispersion to a temperature of at least the softening point of the resin particles;
opening an outlet provided in the closed container below the surface of the dispersion;

discharging through the outlet the aqueous dispersion containing the resin particles
having the expanding agent impregnated therein into an atmosphere having a pressure

lower than that in the closed container.
Particles according to claim 1 which have a particle size such that said particles pass
through a sieve having 2.5 meshes and do not pass through a sieve having 30 meshes.
Particles according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said isotactic propylene polymer is an
isotactic propylene homopolymer.
Particles according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said isotactic propylene polymer is an
isotactic propylene copolymer containing 0.1 to 10% by weight of ethylene

copolymerized therewith or 0.1 to 25% by weight of butene-1 copolymerized
therewith.
