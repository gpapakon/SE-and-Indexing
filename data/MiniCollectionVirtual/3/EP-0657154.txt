<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bed according to the
preamble of claim 1.Such a hospital bed, for example, is known from the German
patent publication DE-3808408-C2. This hospital bed
comprises an upper body supporting bed frame part
articulated to a support frame and a thigh supporting bed
frame part also articulated to the support frame. The
upper body supporting bed frame part and the thigh
supporting bed frame part are adjustable in inclination by
respective adjustment means, which, for example, are
cylinder piston devices or a threaded rod and a worm wheel
which may be operated by hand. The inclination angles of
the respective bed frame parts of this known bed are
adjustable independently of each other so that the problem
arises that upon improper adjustment of the inclination 
angle of at least one of the bed frame parts with respect
to the support frame, a patient lying on the bed is
positioned in an ergonomically improper lying or sitting
position, which, in some cases, might lead to damage to
the patient's health. Further, there arises the problem
that side rail members which, in some cases, can be
mounted to the respective bed frame parts in order to
prevent the patient from falling out of bed when moving in
an undesired or improper manner might interfere with each
other in the adjacent end portions thereof. This problem
arises in particular if the respective bed frame parts are
inclined with respect to the supporting frame in high
degree.Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to
provide a bed in which, upon adjustment of the inclination
angle of at least one of the bed frame parts, the
resulting lying or sitting positioning of the bed is
always ergonomically advantageous for the patient lying in
the bed, and which prevents the mutual interference of
side rail members if such members are attached to the
respective bed frame parts.According to the invention this problem is solved by the
bed according to claim 1. The bed of the present invention eliminates the risk of
the angular distance between the upper body supporting bed
frame part and the thigh supporting bed frame part
becoming too small and, thus, secures, upon any adjusting
operation of the bed frame parts, an ergonomically
advantageous sitting or lying positioning. Additional side
rail members attached to the bed frame parts do not
interfere with each other even if at least one of the bed
frame parts is lifted to a high extent.For controlling the operation of the adjustment means the
bed according to the present
