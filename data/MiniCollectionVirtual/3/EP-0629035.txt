<ABSTRACT>
A bearing retainer 20 has a hollow body 21 with an open end forming a mouth 25. 
The mouth opens into an inner void 23 having a bearing support surface 28 for 

receiving a bearing. The void also has a plurality of axially extending ribs 30 defining a 
number of lubrication reservoirs or recesses 33. A plurality of teeth 26 extend axially 

from the open end for engaging a hole in the motor casing to prevent rotation between 
the retainer and the casing and are deformable to prevent axial separation. Proud coplanar 

abutment surfaces 27 are respectively disposed between adjacent teeth and bear 
against the casing to axially align the casing and retainer. The bearing is made by 

forging, casting or sintering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bearing retainer for a miniature motor and to a method of 
fitting a bearing to a motor casing using the bearing retainer. In particular, the 
invention relates to a bearing retainer made by forging, casting, sintering or similar 
molding techniques. The rotor of a fractional horsepower or miniature motor is normally mounted for 
rotation in bearings supported by an integral end wall of a drawn metal can forming 
the motor casing and by an end cover or cap closing the casing. The end wall has a 
hole through which the motor shaft extends. The wall may be deformed to form a 
recess or housing for the shaft bearing as shown, for example, in GB 2207291. This 
process is complicated and thus costly to perform with a high degree of accuracy. As an alternative, the bearing may be retained in a bearing retainer which is fitted to 
the hole in the end wall of the motor casing. The retainer may be a plastic part as 
shown, for example, in GB 1216146. Here, a plastic ring is used to grip the bearing 
and retain it with respect to the casing. However, as indicated, the plastic material 
which makes that method economically viable is not suitable for sleeve or self-aligning 
sleeve bearings with the motor casing providing the lateral support directly to the 
bearing. Other bearing retainers of plastics material are disclosed in FR-A-2054015 and JP-A-62081948. 
The bearing retainer disclosed in FR-A-2054015 is formed according to  
 
the preamble of claim 1 and the bearing retainer disclosed in JP-A-62081948 has legs 
which are passed through holes in the bearing mounting and heat-fusion welded to the 
mounting. Machined bearing retainers, usually turned parts, formed from aluminium have proved 
very satisfactory in retaining the bearing axially but there is a problem with the 
retainer rotating with respect to the casing as the retainer by necessity is round and 
fitted to a round hole. Also, the cost of providing machined parts is becoming a 
significant cost component in a miniature motor. Hence, there is a need for an alternative to plastic and machined bearing retainers for 
the end wall of motor casings for miniature motors. The present invention provides a bearing retainer formed by forging, casting or 
sintering, which means that the retainer can be produced from steel or other metals 
giving good dimensional stability and strength and can be formed to mate with non-circular 
holes in the motor casing, thereby positively preventing rotation of the bearing 
retainer with respect to
