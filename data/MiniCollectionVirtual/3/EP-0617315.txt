<ABSTRACT>
A film cassette (1) adapted to be opened and closed 
comprises a film spool (9) supported for rotation, and 

movable locking means (11) for inhibiting rotation of the film 
spool when the cassette is closed and allowing the film 

spool to rotate when the cassette is opened. According 
to the invention, retaining means keeps the movable 

locking means in place to make it inhibit rotation of the 
film spool when the cassette is opened, but allows the 

film spool to be initially forcibly rotated to move the 
locking means out of place to then allow the film spool 

to be freely rotated. Thus, the film spool must be 
rotated to discontinue the effect of the locking means 

after the cassette is opened.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to commonly assigned
copending U.S. applications Serial No. 07/787356, entitled
FILM CASSETTE WITH INTEGRATED CASSETTE ELEMENT LOCK AND
LIGHT BLOCKING DEVICE and filed Nov. 4, 1991 in the name
of Dennis R. Zander, corresponding to EP-A-0 540 938 published May 12, 1993, and constituting prior art within the meaning of Article 54(3), EPC; Serial No. 08/036,020, entitled FILM
CASSETTE WITH SPOOL LOCK AND LIGHT-SHIELDING DOOR and
filed March 22, 1993 in the names of Dennis R. Zander and
Eugene Sisto, corresponding to EP-A-0 617 316 published September 28, 1994, after the priority date of the present application; and Serial No. 08/034,978, entitled FILM
CASSETTE WITH SPOOL LOCK AND LIGHT-SHIELDING DOOR,
filed March 22, 1993 in the names of Dennis R. Zander and
Hideaki Kataoka and issued May 31, 1994 as US-A-5 317 355 after the priority date of the present application. The invention relates generally to the field of
photography, and in particular to a film cassette
containing a film spool about which a filmstrip is
coiled. More specifically, the invention relates to a
film cassette having a spool lock for preventing
unintended rotation of the film spool.Film cassettes provided with a spool lock for
preventing unintended rotation of a film spool inside the
cassette are generally known.For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,479 issued
Sep. 9, 1980 discloses a film cassette adapted to be
opened and closed comprising a film spool supported for
rotation, and movable locking means for inhibiting
rotation of the film spool when the cassette is closed
and allowing the film spool to rotate when the cassette
is opened. The film cassette has a pair of collar halves
at each end of the cassette with respective polygon-shaped
bearing halves for receiving polygon-shaped
journals at opposite ends of the film spool. When the
film cassette is closed, rotation of film spool is
inhibited because of the contact between the bearing
halves and the journals. Conversely, when the film
cassette is opened, the film spool is free to rotate 
because bearing halves have been moved away from the
journals.According to another example, U.S. Pat. No.
5,115,268 issued May 19, 1992 discloses a film cassette
comprising a light-trapping plush for preventing ambient
light from entering the cassette interior through a film
egress/ingress passageway, a film spool supported for
rotation in film unwinding and film winding directions,
and a locking pawl supported for movement into engagement
with the film spool to secure the spool and out

<CLAIMS>
A film cassette (1) adapted to be opened and
closed comprising a film spool (9) supported for rotation,

and movable locking means (11) for inhibiting rotation of said
film spool (9) when said cassette (1) is closed and allowing the

film spool (9) to rotate when the cassette (1) is opened, is
characterized in that

   retaining means (21,39) is arranged to keep said movable locking
means (11) in place to make it inhibit rotation of said film

spool (9) when said cassette (1) is opened until the film
spool (9) has been initially forcibly rotated to move the

locking means (11) out of place to then allow the film spool (9)
to be freely rotated, whereby the film spool (9) must be

rotated to discontinue the effect of the locking means (11)
after the cassette (1) is opened.
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 1,
wherein said locking means (11) includes a symmetrically

shaped detent (37) for engaging said film spool (9), and said film
spool (9) is rotatable in film unwinding and film winding

directions (U,W) and has a toothed periphery with respective
successive teeth (15) that are symmetrically shaped to receive

said detent (37) between any two adjacent ones of said teeth (15)
and to eject the detent (37) from between those two teeth to

move said locking means (11) out of place when said film spool (9)
is initially forcibly rotated in the film unwinding or

film winding direction (U,W).
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 1,
wherein light-shielding means (7) arranged to open and close is provided to open

and close said cassette (1).
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 3,
wherein said light-shielding means (7) includes cam means (47)

arranged to move said locking means (11) into place to inhibit rotation
of said film spool (9) when the locking means (11) is closed and to be

retracted from the locking means (11) when the

light-shielding means (7) is opened.
A film cassette (1) comprising a film spool (9)
supported for rotation, a spool lock (11) supported for

movement into engagement with said film spool (9) to secure
the film spool (9) and out of engagement with the film spool (9), 

and actuation means for moving said spool lock (11) into contact
with said film spool (9) and holding the spool

lock (11) in contact with the film spool (9), is characterized in
that:


said actuation means is retractable from said
spool lock (11) to release the spool lock (11) from being held

engaged with said film spool (9) by said actuation means to permit the spool lock (11) to
be disengaged from the film spool (9);
said film spool (9) includes integral means for
disengaging said spool lock (11) from the film spool (9)

responsive to rotation of the film spool after said
actuation means has released the spool lock (11); and
retaining means (21,39) is arranged is hold said spool lock (11) engaged
with said film spool (9) even though said actuation means has

released the spool lock (11), but to allow the spool lock (11) to be
disengaged from the film spool (9) responsive to rotation of

the film spool (9).
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 5,
wherein said spool lock (11) includes a symmetrically shaped

detent (37) for engaging said film spool (9), said film spool (9) is
rotatable in film unwinding and film winding directions (U,W),

and said integral means of said film spool (9) is a toothed
periphery with respective successive teeth (15) that are

symmetrically shaped to receive said detent (37) between any
two adjacent ones of said teeth (15) and to eject the detent (37)

from between those two teeth when said film spool (9) is
rotated in the film unwinding or film winding

direction (U,W).
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 5,
wherein said actuation means includes light-shielding

means (7) which is arranged to close to prevent ambient light from entering
the cassette interior when the actuation means moves said

spool lock (11) into contact with said film spool (9) and to
open when the actuation means releases the spool lock (11).
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 5,
wherein said retaining means (21,39) includes integral means for

releasing said spool lock (11) from being held engaged with
said film spool (9) when the film spool (9) is rotated. 
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 5,
wherein said retaining means (21,39) includes respective

cooperating means fixed to the inside of the cassette and
to said spool lock (11) for releasing the spool lock (11) from

being held engaged with said film spool (9) when the film
spool (9) is rotated, for holding the spool lock (11) disengaged

from the film spool (9), and for releasing the spool lock (11)
from being held disengaged from the spool (9) in response to said

actuation means moving the spool lock (11) into contact with
