<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle-mounted crane which attains a minimum travelling speed of 62 km/h on public roads and affords the driver a circular field of view with a maximum radius of 12 m has a vehicle frame (10) which is lowered essentially to the level of the centres of the vehicle wheels (11), at least some of the vehicle wheels being provided with individual hydrostatic wheel drives which are each arranged in the area of the wheel hubs. Furthermore, the vehicle-mounted crane has engine units (1) for driving the vehicle and for operating the crane, these engine units being mounted above the vehicle frame (10) in a rotary table (12) which is mounted in a horizontally pivotable manner on the vehicle frame. A driver's cab (14), as viewed in the travelling direction, is fastened in front of the engine units (1) to the rotary table (12), and a split longitudinal spindle (6) is provided in the area of the driver's cab. In the travelling mode of the vehicle, the longitudinal spindle (6) can be mechanically locked to the steering gear for the vehicle wheels (11). The crane mast (13) of the vehicle-mounted crane can be put down with its front end on the low-lying vehicle frame (10) and has a basic mast length which essentially corresponds to the length of the vehicle frame.

<CLAIMS>
A crane vehicle comprising a deflection-resistant and 
torsion-proof vehicle frame (10) as well as 

superstructure and chassis, wheels (11) which are 
individually suspensed on said vehicle frame and which 

can be steered at least partly by means of a steering 
means, a turntable (12) supported in a horizontally 

pivotable manner on said vehicle frame (10), and a 
telescopic crane boom (13) which can be pivoted along 

with said turntable and, in addition, in a vertical 
direction, and motor means (1) for travel operation 

and for crane operation, as well as a driver's cab 
(14) with a driver's seat provided therein,
characterized in
 that 

said vehicle frame (10) is substantially lowered to 
the level of the centers of said wheels (11); 
at least part of said wheels (11) are provided with 
hydrostatic individual wheel drives (3) which are 

arranged in the area of the wheel hubs, 
that said motor means (1) for travel operation and for 
crane operation are arranged above said vehicle frame 

(10), i.e., in the area of the rear half thereof in 
said turntable (12), 
that said driver's cab (14) is secured upstream of 
said motor means (1) to said turntable (12), said 

driver's cab being adapted to be bolted to the chassis 
during travel operation;  

 
that a split steering spindle (6) which is 
mechanically lockable for travel operation with the 

steering means of said wheels (11) is provided in the 
area of said driver's cab (14), and 
that said crane boom (13) can be placed with its 
front end on the lower vehicle frame (10) and has a 

basic boom length substantially corresponding to the 
length of said vehicle frame (10). 
A crane vehicle according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said motor means (1) which are jointly 

arranged in said turntable (12) for travel operation 
and for crane operation comprise a hydraulic oil 

travel pump (1a) which is connected to said 
hydrostatic wheel drives (3), with the area of the 

rotational axis of said turntable (12) within said 
vehicle frame (10) having provided therein a rotary 

leadthrough (2) for said hydraulic oil for supplying 
said hydaulic oil from said leadthrough to said wheel 

drives (3). 
A crane vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a locally movable additional 

counterweight (5) is provided for crane operation, 
said counterweight being adapted to be placed in the 

area of the front end of said vehicle frame (10) in 
the travel mode and being adapted to be secured in the 

area of the rear end of said turntable (12) during 
crane operation. 
A crane vehicle according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that said driver's cab (14) has a 

removable top and that said driver's seat (15) which 
is provided in said driver's cab is adapted to be 

lowered to such a degree that the driver's head is 
movable below the highest vehicle edge (17).  

 
A crane vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that hydraulic oil can be supplied to 

said hydrostatic wheel drives (3) through spring 
cylinders (16) assigned to each wheel (11). 
A crane vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that hydraulic oil can be supplied to 

said hydrostatic wheel drives (3) through a wheel 
suspension assigned to each wheel (11).
