<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for upgrading dilute acid from titanium dioxide production by the sulphate process. Stepwise neutralisation and filtering-off of the precipitate metal oxides and reactive extraction to remove magnesium and manganese, gives an aqueous ammonium sulphate solution which is subjected, if desired, to evaporative crystallisation to form solid ammonium sulphate.

Continuous process for working up thin acid from titanium dioxide production by the 
sulphate process, characterised in that 


a) the thin acid is partly neutralised in a first stage using ammonia to pH values of 4 
to 6 at temperatures above 50°C up to the boiling point of the solution, preferably 

70°C to 110°C, 
b) the compounds of the metals, titanium, vanadium, chromium, aluminium and in 
some cases iron which are formed and are difficult to dissolve are filtered off 

from a) and the filter cake is optionally washed and further worked up,
 
by 


b
1
) oxidising the filter cake using air/oxygen, at the same time adding sodium 
hydroxide solution and heating at temperatures above 100°C, wherein the pH 

value is kept at
>
12, 
b

) filtering off the compounds of the metals titanium and iron which are formed 
and are difficult to dissolve from b
1
), 
b
3
) cooling the filtrate from b
2
), which contains the soluble compounds of the 
metals aluminium, vanadium and chromium, by adding seeds or neutralising to 

pH 7 using CO

, 
b
4
) filtering off the compounds of aluminium which are formed and are difficult 
to dissolve from b
3
), 
b
5
) adjusting the filtrate from b
4

sulphuric acid,  

 
b
6
) filtering off the compounds of vanadium which are formed and are difficult to 
dissolve from b
5
), and 
b
7
) precipitating from the filtrate from b
6
) the chromium as chromium hydroxide 
at pH 5-6 by adding sodium sulphite and sodium carbonate, 
c) the filtrate and optionally the washing water from b) are neutralised using 
ammonia to pH values of about 7 and oxidation is carried out at the same time 

using air/oxygen, 
d) the compounds of the metals iron and in some cases manganese which are formed 
and are difficult to dissolve are filtered off from c) and the filter cake is optionally 

washed and further worked up, 
e) the filtrate and optionally the washing water from d) are subjected to reactive 
extraction to remove magnesium and manganese at temperatures of 60 to 95°C, 

preferably 70 to 90°C by 

e
1
) contacting an ammonium salt of a phosphoric acid derivative or a phosphonic 
acid derivative in an organic solution in counter-current with the filtrate, wherein 

the ammonium ions move into the filtrate and the magnesium and manganese ions 
into the organic solution, 
e

) freeing the organic solution of magnesium and manganese by adding aqueous 
sulphuric acid solution with formation of sulphurous, aqueous, magnesium 

sulphate-containing, manganese sulphate-containing solution, 
e

) with ammonium hydroxide and using it 
again in e

), 
f) after removing magnesium and manganese, the aqueous ammonium sulphate 
solution from e) is optionally subjected to evaporative crystallisation to form solid 

ammonium sulphate. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the magnesium-containing, 
manganese-containing solution from e
2
) is cooled, so that the magnesium-ammonium 
sulphate/manganese sulphate is precipitated and separated off.
