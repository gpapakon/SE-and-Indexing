A jet pipe for a high-pressure cleaning appliance with a high-pressure line (3) and a discharge 
nozzle (5) attached thereto, 
characterized in that
 the high-pressure line is in the 
form of a flexible high-pressure hose (3) and carries a plurality of articulated members 

(8) pressed concentrically onto the high-pressure hose (3), each articulated member (8) is 
provided at its two ends with an inner and an outer ball-race surface (11 and 10 respectively), 

wherein the inner ball-race surface (11) of an articulated member (8) rests flat 
and with friction on the outer ball-race surface (10) of the adjacent articulated member 

(8) and surrounds it to such an extent that the two articulated members (8) are fixed relative 
to each other in the longitudinal direction, but are pivotable with respect to each 

other while overcoming the clamping action. 
A jet pipe according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the articulated members (8) are 
constructed in the form of a sleeve, and their end regions are bent over in a circular shape 

in longitudinal section. 
A jet pipe according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the ball-race surfaces (10, 
11) are provided with a profiling in order to increase the clamping forces. 
A jet pipe according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the profiling is a knurled portion. 
A jet pipe according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the articulated 
member (8) rests closely against the high-pressure hose (3) in its middle portion (9) 

situated between the ball-race surfaces (10, 11) and is at a distance from the high-pressure 
hose (3) in the region of the ball-race surfaces (10, 11). 
A jet pipe according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the articulated 
member (8) adjacent to the nozzle (5) closely surrounds the nozzle (5) or an attachment 

part rigidly connected thereto. 
A jet pipe according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the high-pressure 
hose (3) is surrounded by a handle part (2) at its end remote from the nozzle (5). 
A jet pipe according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the articulated member (8) 
adjacent to the handle part (2) is secured in the handle part (2) concentrically to the high-pressure  

 
hose (3). 
A jet pipe according to Claim 7 or 8, 
characterized in that
 the handle part (2) carries an 
attachment piece (1) for attaching the jet pipe to a high-pressure line. 
A jet pipe according to one of Claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the high-pressure 
hose (3) is mounted in the handle part (2) in an inflexible manner. 
A jet pipe according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the articulated 
members (8) are surrounded by a flexible jacket (14). 
A jet pipe according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the jacket (14) is a bellows.
