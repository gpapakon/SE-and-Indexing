A device for monitoring the kinetic energy of a 
sliding door, comprising a drive motor (1) supplied 

by a mains element (5) with a digital pulse 
transmitter (2), a pulse evaluating unit (3) and a 

processor system adapted for processing the signals 
from the pulse evaluating unit (3) for determining 

the position of the door, characterised in that the 
device comprises a motor current detection member 

(7, 8), more particularly connected to an 
analogue/digital converter (9), and a controller (4) 

for determining the power used and from this the 
kinetic energy of the sliding door. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 

the motor current detection member (7, 8) is 
arranged in a line leading from a mains element (5) 

to the motor (1). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that it comprises a motor current limiter (6) 

connected to the controller (4), more particularly 
in the form of a controllable end stage, which acts 

as a door velocity control member and is arranged in 
the line leading from the mains element (5) to the 

motor (1). 
A device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised 
in that the pulse evaluating device (3), the motor 

current detection member (7, 8) and the mains 
element (5) are connected to the controller (4) via 

electrical connections. 
A device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it comprises a 

controller (4), which is adapted for producing a  
 

program for limiting the kinetic energy of a sliding 
door, more particularly a lift door.
