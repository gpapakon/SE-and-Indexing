<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a draw-out framework for electrical apparatus, especially for a circuit breaker. This draw-out framework (10) is associated with a connecting baseplate (14) and includes two fixed flanges (12, 13) fixed to this baseplate and two movable flanges (17, 18) attached to two opposite side walls of the circuit breaker (11). The movable flanges each bear two driveshafts (20, 21) respectively engaged in two guide grooves (19) of the fixed flanges. These driveshafts can slide in the guide grooves under the action of ramps formed in operating levers (30) provided with an operating handle (32). The circuit breaker (11) can take up a first plug-in position on the connecting baseplate or a second unplugged position. The shafts (20, 21) each carry a free wheel bearing ring (20a, 21a) and two fixed pins (20b, 20c; 21b, 21c) arranged on either side of the bearing ring. The framework can be adapted to various types of electrical apparatus, especially to three-pole or four-pole circuit breakers.

A draw-out rack for a circuit breaker, which is arranged to be held in a first position
in which it is drawn-in on a connecting base or in a second position in which it is

drawn-out from this base, said rack comprising two fixed flanges securedly united to
the connecting base, and a support supporting the circuit breaker and arranged to

cooperate with said fixed flanges to keep the circuit breaker in the first or second
position, said support comprising two mobile flanges (17, 18) arranged to be affixed to

two opposite side walls of the circuit breaker by fixing means, each mobile flange
being provided with guide means cooperating with the corresponding fixed flanges

(12, 13) to achieve movement of the circuit breaker (11) from one to the other of said
first or second position, said guide means comprising at least two drive spindles (20,

21) securedly united to the mobile flanges (17, 18) and respectively engaged in two
guide grooves (19) arranged in the two fixed flanges (12, 13),

characterized in that

said spindles (20, 21) both bear a bearing ring (20a, 21a) fitted loose and two fixed
pins (20b, 20c; 21b, 21c) fitted on each side of said bearing ring,
each fixed flange (12, 13) is equipped with an operating lever (30) provided with a

handle (32) and pivoting around a fixed spindle (31), said operating lever (30)
comprising a recess (33) whose edges form two guide ramps for the drive spindle

(21) engaged in said recess,
and a locking device (36) is arranged on the operating lever (30) to block it in a
position corresponding to one or the other of said first and second positions of the

circuit breaker.
The rack according to claim 1, characterized in that the fixed flanges (12, 13) are
secured to the connecting base (14) by means of spacers (34) adaptable to the type

of circuit breaker (11).
The rack according to claim 1, characterized in that the locking device (36)
comprises a body (40) equipped with a spiral ramp, two pins (41), a locking spindle

(42) one end of which is arranged to engage in openings arranged in the operating
lever (30), a guide barrel (43), a return spring (44) working in compression-torsion

and a locking spring (45) working in compression. 
The rack according to claim 1, characterized in that at least one of said mobile
flanges (17, 18) is equipped with an error prevention device (50).
The rack according to claim 1, characterized in that at least one of said fixed
flanges (12, 13) is equipped with a sliding earthing contact (35).
The rack according to claim 1, characterized in that at least one of said operating
levers (30) is equipped with apertures (38, 39) arranged to enable padlocking of this

lever in a predetermined position.
The rack according to claim 1, characterized in that the fixed flanges (12, 13) are
equipped with microcontacts for indication of end of travel of the corresponding

operating lever (30).
