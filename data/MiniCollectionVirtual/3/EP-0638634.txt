<ABSTRACT>
A microemulsion composition comprising approximately by weight 6 to 50% of 
a mixture of two different anionic surfactants, one of said anionic surfactants being a 

sulphonate and the other said anionic surfactant being a sulphate, a ratio of said 
sulphonate to said sulphate being 10:1 to 1:10; 0 to 6% of a nonionic surfactant; 1 to 

20% of at least one of a water insoluble organic compound; 0 to 8% of a solubilizing 
agent; 0 to 20% of at least one water soluble hydroxy containing organic compound; 

and the balance being water, wherein the composition has a pH of 1 to 11.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stable microemulsion cleaning composition and to
processes for manufacture and use thereof. More particularly, it relates to a stable
aqueous microemulsion cleaning composition in concentrated or diluted form which is
especially effective to clean oily and greasy soils from substrates such as bathroom
fixtures and walls, leaving such surfaces clean and shiny without the need for
extensive rinsing thereof. The described compositions comprise a mixture of anionic
surfactants, a water insoluble organic compound is less than 1.0 wt. % soluble in
water at 25 degrees C and having a dH of 0 to 12 (MPa)1/2 dd of 14 to 19 (MPa)1/2
   and dP of 0 to 6 (MPa)1/2, water and a suitable co-surfactant system, which co-surfactant
system adjusts the interface conformation to reduce interfacial tension at
interfaces between dispersed and continuous phases of the emulsion to produce a
stable normally clear microemulsion at room temperature. When the pH of the
microemulsion is on the acid side, preferably in the range of 1 to 4, the invented
compositions are useful for removing lime scale and soap scum from hard substrates.This invention also relates to a gelled microemulsion cleaning composition and to
processes for manufacture and use thereof. More particularly, it relates to a stable
gelled microemulsion cleaning composition in concentrated form which is especially
effective to clean oily and greasy soils from vertical surfaces such as bathroom fixtures
and walls, leaving such surfaces clean and shiny without the need for extensive
rinsing thereof. The described compositions comprise a mixture of anionic
surfactants, a water insoluble organic compound having a dH of 0 to 1 (MPa)1/2, dd
of 14 to 18 (MPa)1/2, and dp of 0 to 2 (MPa)1/2, water and a suitable co-surfactant
system, which co-surfactant system adjusts the interface conformation to reduce
interfacial tension at interfaces between dispersed and continuous phases of the
emulsion of the surfactants, produces a stable gelled microemulsion at room
temperature. When the pH of the gelled microemulsion is on the acid side, preferably 
in the range of 1 to 4, the invented compositions are useful for removing lime scale
and soap scum from hard substrates.Liquid detergent compositions, usually in solution or emulsion form, have been
employed as all-purpose detergents and have been suggested for cleaning hard
surfaces such as painted woodwork, bathtubs, sinks, tile floors, tiled walls, linoleum,
paneling and washable wallpaper. Many such
