<ABSTRACT>
Novel regimens are provided for administering foreign genetically modifided allogeneic cells to a host by combining the administration of the cells with a reduced regimen of an immunosuppressive agent. Particularly, cells having a reduced level of Class I MHC antigens may be employed in a variety of cellular therapy situations, where foreign cells are engrafted to treat diseased states.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is cellular
transplantation therapy.There are many medical conditions arising from the
loss of cell number or function where cellular therapies
could be employed. These therapies may involve employment
of autologous or allogeneic cells or tissue, and even
instances of xenogeneic cells or tissue. Such cellular
therapies, including bone narrow transplantation, organ
transplants or grafts, skin grafts, muscle transplants,
blood transfusions or particular blood cell populations,
e.g., white blood cells and platelets, endocrine tissue,
islet cells, e.g., islets of Langerhans, adrenal cells,
hepatic cells, retinal epithelial cells, endothelial
cells, osteoblasts, keratinocytes, chondrocytes and the
like, involve the administering of cells or tissue to a
mammalian host, where the cells are to remain viable and
functional, usually substituting for or interdigitating
with the diseased or incompetent cells or tissue of the
host. Similarly, cellular transplant therapies may be
employed for a variety of purposes using cells modified in
a variety of ways: cells altered to reduce
immunogenicity; cells altered to produce therapeutic
compounds, either naturally occurring or mutated, such as 
cytokines, hormones, clotting factors, anti-clotting
factors, growth hormones, colony stimulating factors
interferons, immunosuppressants, etc.; cells altered to be
resistant to infection with microorganisms, viruses or
other pathogens; and cells altered to be capable of homing
to targeted sites of malignant or infectious disease
processes.As is well known, the immune system protects a host
from foreign substances. The immune system is able to
detect the introduction of allogeneic tissue by virtue of
the major histocompatibility complex antigens. These
antigens comprise for the most part Class I and II MHC,
although there are minor histocompatibility antigens
referred to as mls (minor lymphocyte stimulating). Thus,
there are numerous proteins present on the cell surface of
different types of cells, which designate the nature of
the host. Because of these differences, when
administering allogeneic cells or transplanting allogeneic
tissue, one frequently encounters rejection.In order to avoid the rejection by the immune system,
the patient is normally treated systemically with immunosuppressive
drugs. These drugs have the effect of
inhibiting all or a substantial proportion of the immune
system associated with the rejection of the foreign cells
and tissue. The immunosuppressive drugs, are for the most
part,
