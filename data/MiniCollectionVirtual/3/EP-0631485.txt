A floor cleaning machine (111) comprising a housing (12) which, on 
top, carries a drive unit (10) powered by an electric motor and, inside, a 

cleaning and/or polishing disc (61) mounted for rotation about a substantially 
vertical shaft (9) and designed to incline slightly on springs in relation to its 

normal horizontal position while the machine is in operation and which is 
connected to a pivotally mounted guide rod (20) and to casters, characterized 

in that the casters support the housing (12) on the floor (22) in stable 
equilibrium and in that a support plate (11) carrying the drive unit (10), the 

cleaning and/or polishing disc (61) and the guide rod (20) is mounted in the 
housing (12) in such a way that it can incline slightly on springs in relation to 

its normal horizontal position about a horizontal shaft (7,8) mounted on the 
housing (12) and on the support plate (11). 
A floor cleaning machine as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
a slide block (14) arranged on the support plate (11) and a shaft bearing 

bracket (13) arranged on the housing (12) - each with a connecting pivot axis 
(7,8) - are disposed axially opposite one another and compression springs 

(17) are arranged offset in relation thereto towards the guide rod (20) 
between the support plate (11) and the housing (12), again axially opposite 

one another. 
A floor cleaning machine as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the precompression of the compression springs (17) is adjusted in such 

a way that, in the rest position, the carrier plate (11) is held in an at least 
substantially horizontal position. 
A floor cleaning machine as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the precompression of the compression springs (17) is 

adjustable. 
A floor cleaning machine as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the casters (19) are at least two and preferably three in 

number, at least one of the casters being vertically adjustable.  
 
A floor cleaning machine as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a dust ring (50) equipped with bristles (51) on the floor 

side is externally arranged for vertical adjustment around the circumference 
of the housing (12) in contact with the floor. 
A floor cleaning machine as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises a warning light (24) which is connected up 

by means of a relay (26) to depend on current and/or power and which comes 
on whenever the motor is overly stressed.
