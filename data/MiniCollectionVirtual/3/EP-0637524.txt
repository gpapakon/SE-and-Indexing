<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a warning light, preferably for a vehicle, having a translucent housing (18) which encloses a light source (38) and an optical system (14) which surrounds the light source (38), consists of several lenses (42, 44) and is driven in rotation by a motor (16) and collects the light into a number of revolving beams corresponding to the number of lenses (42, 44). It is proposed that the lenses (42, 44) which produce the light beams be realised using Fresnel optics and should form a hollow element (48) which surrounds the light source (38) radially. As a result, a cost-effective design is produced which is easy to assemble and to service and in which a high proportion of the light emitted by the light source (38) can be used to form the warning light beams.
