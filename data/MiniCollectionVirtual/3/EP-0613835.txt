<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dispenser (Sp) for the simultaneous delivery of at least two pasty products (I, II) by depressing an operating handle, which products (I, II) emerge from two adjacent openings (a', b') of a nozzle (8) connected to separate chambers (3, 4). To achieve a constructional shape which is advantageous for handling and use, it is proposed that the two chambers (3, 4) are designed as a cartridge arranged between two pump actuating heads (15, 16) with a central transverse wall (5) and a cartridge plunger (6, 7) which can be pumped towards it, channels (11, 12) extending from said transverse wall, which lead to the openings (a', b') of the nozzle (8).
