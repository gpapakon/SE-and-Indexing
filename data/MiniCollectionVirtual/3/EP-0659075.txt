<ABSTRACT>
A printing process for producing a flat administration form containing a dosage proportion of medicaments or a flat device for dispensing doses of volatile substances such as perfumes into ambient air uses easily volatile or thermally unstable dosing media in the liquid or semi-solid state as ingredients of the administration form or device. A fluid preparation of the ingredients is doctored in a dosed amount into at least a volumetrically defined recess of a flat printing plate. The substrate to be loaded with the ingredients or dosing media is a web shaped material guided under tension step by step over the recess of the printing plate and pressed into the filled recess by means of a mechanical printing device. The substrate thus absorbs a dosed amount of the ingredient from the printing plate.

A process for the production of a flat administration form having 
a drug portion capable of being dosed or of a flat-shaped device 

for the dosable release of volatile substances, such as aromatic 
substances, to the ambient air by using high-volatile or 

thermolabile dosing media in liquid or semisolid state as the ingredients 
of the administration form or of the device by means of 

printing processes, wherein a flowable preparation of the ingredients 
is knife-coated in a measured amount into at least one volumetrically 

defined sink of a flat printing block, characterized in that 
a substrate to be charged with the ingredients or dosing media, 

respectively, is gradually led as a web-shaped material under web 
tension over the cavity of the printing block and pressed into the 

filled cavity by means of a mechanical pressure device whereby 
the substrate takes up the ingredient from the printing block in 

measured amount. 
The process according to claim 1 characterized in that the substrate 
printed with ingredients is added to the administration form 

as a component thereof, for example is laminated thereon. 
The process according to claim 1 characterized in that the substrate 
printed with ingredients is brought into contact with the 

administration form in such a manner that it releases the ingredients 
to the administration form or to the device by means of diffusion. 
The process according to claim 1 characterized in that the administration 
form is a dermally applicable system. 
The process according to claim 1 characterized in that the administration 
form is an orally applicable system.  

 
The process according to claim 2 characterized in that the dermally 
applicable system is a transdermal therapeutic system. 
The process according to claim 2 characterized in that the dermally 
applicable system is a topically effective therapeutic system. 
The process according to any one of the preceding claims characterized 
in that the dosing medium comprises active substances. 
The process according to any one of the preceding claims characterized 
in that the dosing medium is active substance-free and 

merely comprises adjuvants. 
The process according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the dosing medium comprises a so-called 

penetration enhancer. 
The process according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the active substance(s) is/are dissolved or 

suspended in one or in a mixture of several penetration enhancers. 
The process according to claim 1 characterized in that the 
dosing medium comprises an aromatic substance. 
The process according to claim 1 characterized in that the 
dosing medium comprises an insecticide or an insect repellent. 
A process for the continuous, in particular fully automatic production 
of the administration form or device according to one or 

several of claims 1 to 13, characterized by the steps: 

i- an abhesive intermediate cover is removed from a self-adhesive 
first matrix layer (4) which is positioned on a  

 
protective film (1) and is in contact with the skin after application 

of the administration form, 
ii- and the intermediate cover is wound on a roll; 
iii- substrate (5) is unwound from a supply roll in the form of a 
web and gradually led under web tension over a dosing station 

and 
iv- in said dosing station is pressed cyclically and with distances 
onto the cavity of the printing block, which is filled 

with dosing medium, and is printed with ingredients in a 
dosable amount; 
v- the protective film is removed from a self-adhesive second 
matrix layer (6) which is placed on an abhesive protective 

film and 
vi- is wound on a roll; 
vii- the printed substrate (5) is laminated between the two matrix 
layers (4) and (6), 
viii- the active substance-containing administration form is separated 
from surrounding active substance-free waste portions 

by means of a subsequent punching procedure, and 
ix- the active substance-free waste is wound on a waste roll, 
x- the administration forms or devices are separated by means 
of a cross cutter and 
xi- in a packing station are covered by strips of packing material 

first, then  
 
xii- sealed on all sides by means of hot sealing, and finally 
xiii- separated into individual, tightly sealed units by means of 
cross-cutting.
