<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a handle mounting structure in a fishing reel, which 
spreads open and deforms a collar (8) by means of the taper action of a 

tapered engaging surface (7b) formed in the end portion of a handle shaft 
(7) to thereby be sure to prevent the handle shaft from being loosened and 

clattered in the rotational direction thereof. The handle mounting structure 
includes: a drive shaft (4a) having a drive gear (4b) and a through-hole 

(4c); a handle shaft (7) to which a handle (5) is fixed and which is 
non-rotatably fitted into the through-hole (4c) of the drive shaft (4a); a 

tapered engaging surface (7b) formed on an end portion of the handle shaft 
(7); a collar (8) deformable radially outwardly and fitted into the 

through-hole (4c) of the drive shaft (4a) so that one end of the collar is 
confronted with the tapered engaging surface (7b); and a threaded member (9) 

engageable with the handle shaft (7). The collar (8) is pressed axially 
against the tapered engaging surface (7b) by the threaded member (9) so that 

the collar (8) is deformed and spread, whereby the collar (8) is brought into 
pressure-contact with an inner surface of the thro
ugh-hole (4c) of the drive 
shaft (4a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a handle mounting
structure in a fishing reel whereby the operation of a handle
for taking up a fishing line round a spool is improved.Conventionally, in a fishing reel, as a method of
preventing the loosening of a handle shaft to be non-rotatably
fitted into a drive shaft having a drive gear, for example,
there is known such a method as disclosed in Japanese Utility
Model Publication No. Sho. 60-777, in which there is formed a
split groove in the end portion of a handle shaft including an
internal thread, an external thread having a tapered portion is
threadedly engaged into the split groove, the split groove is
spread open and deformed outwardly in the diameter direction
thereof by means of the tapered portion of the external thread,
and the end portion of the handle shaft is pressed against the
inner surface of the drive shaft, thereby preventing the
loosening of the handle shaft in the rotational direction
thereof.However, in this method, since the two sides of the
split groove portion of the handle shaft end portion are
deformed outwardly by the tapered portion of the tapered
external thread, the internal thread portion of the end portion
of the handle shaft is also affected by the outward deformation 
of the split groove and thus the threaded engagement of the
internal thread portion with the external thread is loosened,
which easily makes the threaded engagement completely
ineffective and gives rise to the poor durability of the handle
shaft when it is mounted and removed.Also, since the split groove is deformed while it is
tightened by the tapered portion of the external thread, the
tapered portion can be easily damaged due to the spiral ridges
of the internal thread portion in the end portion of the handle
shaft, so that a stable deforming action due to the contact of
the tapered portion cannot be provided.In the above-mentioned conventional handle mounting
structure, since the two sides of the split groove portion
formed in the end portion of the handle shaft are deformed
outwardly, the internal thread of the end portion of the handle
shaft is also affected by the outward deformation of the split
groove portion to loosen the threaded engagement with respect
to the external thread. This can easily make the threaded
engagement quite useless and can give rise to the poor
durability of the handle shaft when it is mounted and removed
repeatedly. At the same time, the tapered portion can be
damaged due to the spiral ridges of the internal thread in the
end portion of

A handle mounting structure in a fishing reel (1)
comprising:


a cylindrical drive shaft (4a) having a drive gear (4);
a handle shaft (7) to which a handle (5) is fixed, said
handle shaft being non-rotatably fitted into said

cylindrical drive shaft;
a threaded member (9) threadingly engageable with said
handle shaft;
a tapered engaging surface (7b) located on an end
portion of either said handle shaft (7), said drive

shaft (4a) or said threaded member (9); and
a securing member (8) disposed on said threaded member
(9) and having a securing portion (8m) inserted and

engaged between said tapered engaging surface (7b) and
an inner surface of said cylindrical drive shaft.
The structure according to claim 1, wherein said tapered
engaging surface is formed on said handle shaft, and

said securing member is a collar which is arranged
around a portion of said handle shaft and located

longitudinally between said threaded member and said
handle shaft.
The structure according to claim 2, wherein said collar
includes a flange portion longitudinally held between

the cylindrical drive shaft and a head portion of said
threaded member. 
The structure according to claim 1, wherein said tapered
engaging surface is formed on said handle shaft, and

said securing second member is formed plate-like in the
form of substantially L-shape, said securing member

being retained on a portion of said threaded member and
longitudinally located between said handle shaft and a

head portion of said threaded member.
The structure according to claim 1, wherein said tapered
engaging surface is formed on a distal end of said

threaded member engaging the securing member mounted
onto said handle shaft, said handle shaft having a

threaded hole for engagement with said threaded member
and an insertion hole communicating with said threaded

hole for permitting said securing member to project into
said threaded hole.
The structure according to claim 1, wherein said
securing member is formed on a portion of a handle

member to which said handle shaft is fixed, and said
tapered engaging surface is formed on an end of said

cylindrical drive shaft facing said portion of said
handle shaft.
The structure according to claim 1, wherein the tapered
engaging surface is formed on the cylindrical drive

shaft facing said securing member which is a collar held
between said drive shaft and said threaded member.
