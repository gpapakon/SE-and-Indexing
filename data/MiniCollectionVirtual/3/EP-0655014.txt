<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel catalysts for the 
catalytic destruction of organic compounds contained in 
waste gas streams and to a process using these 
catalysts. Presently, there is great concern about 
contamination of the environment by hazardous volatile 
organics originating in the manufacture of organic 
chemicals, cleaning and degreasing processes, and vent 
or exhaust air from air stripping of contaminated 
groundwater or soil. Typically, thermal incineration 
is used in the destruction of these materials but this 
retires very high temperatures (1300째C) and special 
equipment resulting in high capital and maintenance 
costs. Carbon adsorption is an alternative. However, 
this process does not destroy the pollutants but merely 
concentrates them. The pollutants must then be removed 
and the carbon regenerated, a costly and tedious 
process. Catalytic oxidation is an energy efficient and 
economical way of destroying hazardous materials. It 
operates at significantly lower temperatures and lower 
residence times than thermal incineration and retires 
smaller reactors made of less expensive materials. Methods for the catalytic oxidation of organic and 
halogenated organic compounds are well known in the 
art. For example, in the article by G.C. Bond and N. 
Sadeghi, "Catalyzed Destruction of Chlorinated 
Hydrocarbons" J. Appl. Chem. Biotechnol., 1975, 25, 
241-248, it is reported that chlorinated hydrocarbons 
are converted to HCl and CO2 over platinum on gamma 
alumina catalyst.  
 U.S. Patents 3,972,979 and 4,053,557 describe the 
decomposition of halohydrocarbons by oxidation over chromium 
oxide or a boehmite supported platinum. U.S. Patents 4,059,675, 4,059,676 and 4,059,683 describe 
methods for decomposing halogenated organic compounds using 
catalysts containing ruthenium, ruthenium-platinum and 
platinum, respectively, in the presence of an oxidizing 
agent at a temperature of at least 350째C. The article by James J. Spivy, "Complete Catalytic 
Oxidation of Volatile Organics," Ind. End. Chem. Res., 1987, 
26, 2165-2180, is a review of the literature dealing with 
the heterogenous catalytic oxidation of volatile organic 
compounds. The article by S. Chatterjee and H.L. Greene, "Oxidative 
Catalysis of Chlorinated Hydrocarbons by Metal-Loaded Acid 
Catalysts", Journal of Catalysis, 130, 76-85 (1991), reports 
on a study of the catalytic oxidation of methylene chloride 
in air using supported zeolite catalysts H-Y, Cr-Y and Ce-Y. U.S. Patent 4,983,366 describes a method for the 
catalytic
