 TITLE Fine Denier Staple Fibers This invention concerns improvements in and relating to fine denier polyester staple fibers and their manufacture and apparatus therefor, and their use, and their precursors and downstream products.Until recently, it had been desired to produce synthetic fibers to more or less match natural fibers, for supply to the textile industry for manufacture into fabrics and garments. So commercial synthetic fibers have been historically made and used for apparel at fineness levels near those of natural fibers. More recently, so called "subdenier" polyester filaments have been available commercially at finer dpfs (deniers per filament less than about 1) but performance and availability of such fine dpf cut fibers (for staple spun yarns) has been limited. This is because conventional spinning and handling technologies have been inadequate for economic production of this subdenier staple, and such fine fibers have been available commercially by expensive routes, such as bicomponent spinning, or other low productivity processes, that are not economically attractive for making commodity staple fiber. Routes to make such fine deniers have been tried, such as (a) to split side-by-side conjugated yarns, (b) to dissolve a sea component out of a sea-island conjugated yarn, (c) to flow-draw freshly-extruded undrawn filaments ("super- stretching") to reduce denier, followed by neck drawing, (d) to use conventional spinning and drawing processes, and (e) to use high speed spinning to obtain oriented fine filaments. Processes (a) and (b) require special spinning devices and are very expensive. It is difficult to produce subdenier filaments using processes (c) and (d) due to spinning and/or drawing breaks and the denier variation has been excessive in practice. The high speed 

 spinning process (e) can be used to produce a fine filament, but this route gives fibers of lower tenacity, lower Young's modulus and higher elongation than fibers prepared by the conventional split low speed spinning and drawing techniques. Further, high speed spinning is not compatible with high cell throughputs or piddling, a step that is necessary for a high throughput split process, i.e., separate spinning and drawing processes. In addition, the low spinning cell extrusion rate is not economical for a staple process.The present invention is concerned with the preparation of uniform, fine fibers at high productivity using the basic elements of a conventional split staple process, so the staple can then be used in

 WHAT WE CLAIM:
1. A process for preparing subdenier polyester staple fiber, wherein polyester polymer of relative viscosity (LRV) in a range about 9 to 23 is melt spun into filaments through spinning capillaries, of cross sectional area, measured in 10-4 cm2, of about 1.8 to 7.5, at a mass flow rate in a range about 0.19 to 0.35 grams/min, wherein each spinning cell contains at least 1600 of such capillaries, and the emerging filaments are radially quenched with cooling air as they pass through a quench chamber, wherein the distribution profile of the amounts of air supplied is controlled so as to provide the freshly-extruded filaments with cooling air in a first zone immediately below the spinneret, then an increased amount of air in another zone below the first zone, and then decreasing the amount of air supplied before the filaments leave the quench chamber, whereby filaments of spun denier less than about 4 are collected at a withdrawal speed of about 650 to 2000 meters per minute and are drawn and converted into staple fiber.
2. A process according to Claim 1, wherein therelative viscosity (LRV) is about 9 to 16.
3. A process according to Claim 1, wherein therelative viscosity (LRV) is about 9 to 11.5. 4. A process according to Claim 1, wherein the ass flow rate per spinning capillary is about 0.23 too.33 grams/min.
5. A process according to Claim 1, wherein thefila ents are spun at a spinning density of at least 21spinning capillaries per square centimeter.
6. Staple fiber, suitable for textileprocessing on a cotton or worsted system, of fine denierin the range about 0.5 to 1 dtex, and of interfilamentdiameter uniformity less than about 7.5% CV, 


 and of polyester polymer of relative viscosity (LRV) about 9 to 16.
7. Staple fiber according to Claim 6, whereinthe -interfilament diameter uniformity is less than about 4% CV.
8. Staple fiber according to Claim 6, wherein the relative viscosity (LRV) is about 9 to about 11.5.

9. Staple fiber according to Claim 6, wherein the relative viscosity (LRV) is about 14. 10. Staple fiber according to Claim 6, of fine denier in the range about 0.6 to 0.9 dtex.
11. An apparatus for melt spinning polymer that includes a spinneret 11, means for passing molten polymer through the spinneret, a hollow cylindrical foraminous member 15 positioned immediately below the spinneret, and a plenum chamber 17 supplied with a current of gas 10 surrounding the foraminous member to form a quench chamber 33 for the filaments 32 to pass through to its exit, characterized in that the radical gas distribution pattern inwards toward the filaments in the chamber is profiled vertically to provide a low but significant gas flow in a first zone 21 immediately below the spinneret, increasing through a larger gas flow in a second zone 22 at a location below the first zone 21, and then decreasing to a lesser gas flow before the exit of the quench chamber, by forming said hollow foraminous member of porosity that increases from a first low porosity in said first zone 21 immediately below the spinneret, through a larger porosity in said second zone 22 at a lower location below said first zone, and then decreases to a second low porosity at the exit of the quench chamber.
12. An apparatus as defined in Claim 11, characterized in that the foraminous member is formed from a perforated plate with holes of diameters that 


increase from corresponding first low values through larger values at said lower location to second low values at the exit.
13. An apparatus as defined in Claim 11, characterized in that the foraminous member is formed from a perforated plate with a hole density that increases from a corresponding first low value through a larger value at said lower location to a second low value at the exit.
