<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide a method which makes it possible to determine the correlation between two optical signals, which makes it possible to correlate two optical signals, without using a crystal element which is associated with a plurality of drawbacks, because the components are quite expensive. It has been found possible to replace a frequency doubling crystal by an active, optical wave guide, e.g. in the form of an active, optical fibre, said wave guide transmitting fluorescence which is intensity-related to the arrived signal. When this fluorescence is detected in spectral bands, e.g. in the blue region of the visible light, an image of the strength of the arriving signal may be formed. Current distance delaying of the two correlated signals makes it possible to produce an image of the correlation between the signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method of correlating two or more 
optical signals as stated in the introductory portion of 
claim 1, as well as a device for correlating two or more 
optical signals and of the type stated in the introductory 
portion of claim 2. Within the field of optical high rate systems it is often 
necessary to obtain knowledge of the shape of the signal 
pulses. If in an optical communications system it is no 
longer possible to detect a signal, the reason will frequently 
be interference with the signals en route in the 
system, e.g. dispersion fading. Usually, it is not possible 
to use conventional measuring equipment, because 
typically the pulse widths of high rate systems will be 
less than 500 picoseconds and are expected to gradually 
approach pulse widths of the order of 5 femtoseconds. It is well-known to obtain this information by correlating 
two signals - either two copies of the same signal (autocorrelation) 
- or two signals, where one is to be measured 
and the other is a well-known reference signal (cross-correlation). 
This is obtained by using a photoactive element 
in the form of a frequency doubling crystal which 
generates second harmonic oscillations of the incident 
light signal. This entails that the incident light, which 
usually has a wavelength of e.g. 1550 nm, is converted to 
light at a wavelength of 775 nm. The intensity of the second harmonic oscillations depends 
upon the intensity of the incident light e.g. to the second 
power. When the two signals are delayed temporally 
during the measurements, e.g. by changing the distance  
 
travelled, the correlation between the two signals can be 
determined, and thus the pulse shape of the measured signals 
can be determined by applying mathematical analysis 
to the measurement result. However, the use of the frequency doubling crystals is 
associated with a plurality of drawbacks, because the components 
are quite expensive. The cystals are vulnerable to 
scratches and mechanical stress. Some of the crystals are 
moreover hygroscopic. For the crystals to be coupled to 
the optical system, it is necessary to use expensive bulk 
optical devices. To achieve the necessary phase matching, 
the components must be aligned very accurately, which 
means the use of an optical table in practice. This technique 
is therefore only useful in connection with laboratory 
tests and can be used only with great difficulty in 
connection with measurements in the field. The article "Autocorrelation of short pulses using a
