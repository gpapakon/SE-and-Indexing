<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for handling
particulate materials at elevated pressure. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a process for handling inert particulate
material such as carbon black at elevated pressure such as in a gas-phase,
fluidized-bed polymerization (e.g., of an ethylene-propylene or
ethylene-propylene-diene rubber, polybutadiene, or polyisoprene).Recently, the production of sticky polymers such as, for
example, ethylene-propylene-diene rubbers has been conducted in a
gas phase polymerization process. These processes typically employ an
inert particulate material which forms a coating on the sticky polymer;
serves to maintain the bed of forming polymer in a fluidized state; and
prevents agglomeration.Commercially, inert particulate materials are available in
the form of beads or pellets which are too large to adequately coat and
maintain the forming polymer in a fluidized state. Therefore, in order
for these inert particulate materials to perform effectively, they have to
be reduced to a smaller particle size before being fed to the gas-phase,
fluidized-bed reactor. This small particle size material, such as carbon
black fluff, is difficult to feed in a controlled manner because it has a
tendency to pack and/or bridge. In particular, carbon black fluff sets
up into a hardened mass when it is pressurized with gas to elevated
pressures. This elevated pressure may typically be about 172 kPa gauge (25 psig).
Physical agitation of the packed inert particulate material such as 
carbon black fluff is impractical for use with a
commercial-size polymerization reactor.EP-A-628,343 discloses a process and an apparatus
for introducing a solid into a reactor with the help
of a feed enclosure connected to the reactor through
an injection pipe. The process comprises introducing
the solid into the feed enclosure wherein most of the
solid settles at rest and then introducing a gas into
the feed enclosure so that the solid is suspended by
the gas to form a solid suspension entrained in a
dilute-phase conveying system by the gas into the
reactor through the injection pipe.Accordingly, there is a need for a method of
feeding small particles of particulate material such
as, for example, inert particulate material,
especially carbon black fluff, to a gas-phase,
fluidized-bed polymerization under elevated pressure
in a controllable manner.The present invention provides a process
comprising: (1) pressurizing a particulate material in
bead or pellet form in at least one vessel to
