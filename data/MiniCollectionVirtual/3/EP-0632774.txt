<ABSTRACT>
Measures are disclosed for modifying the boundary layer flow over fluid dynamic surfaces using patterns of riblets which are set at a peak-to-peak spacing substantially less than 80 wall units and which are provided with boundary layer suction means comprising apertures (A) between the riblets for a combinative improvement of boundary layer flow. In a further aspect, riblets are employed in combination with wall apertures as an improved means of shock wave (W) control by permitting recirculation of boundary layer fluid from downstream to upstream of the shock wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the modification of 
boundary layer flows over fluid dynamic surfaces, which 
may be aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surfaces. It is 
particularly concerned with the use of small-geometry 
surface configurations comprising rib-like elements to 
modify heat, mass or momentum transport by controlling 
interaction of a boundary layer of the flow with the 
surface. There have been many investigations in recent 
years of the effects that small-geometry surface 
configurations can have on turbulent boundary layers. 
Particular attention has been paid to the provision of 
so-called riblet surfaces in which an array of small 
longitudinal rib-like elements known as riblets extend 
over the turbulent boundary layer region of a surface in 
the direction of fluid flow over the surface, to reduce 
momentum transport or drag. Experimental results indicate 
that net surface drag reductions of up to about 7% can be 
achieved. In a paper "Drag Characteristics of V-Groove and 
Transverse Curvature Riblets" (presented by M.J. Walsh at 
the Symposium on Viscous Drag Reduction, Dallas, Texas, 
November 7-8, 1979) reference is made to an early 
investigation (1966) by Liu, Kline, and Johnston in which 
drag reductions of 3-4% were obtained by reducing the 
turbulent bursting rate, i.e. the rate of break-up of the 
low speed longitudinal vortices that characteristically 
form in a turbulent boundary layer flow close to a wall, 
by employing rectangular fins. Walsh's paper reports the 
investigation of a number of alternative rib profiles and 
states he was able to obtain a maximum drag reduction of 
7% using V-groove riblets. In the prior art and later in this specification 
it is often usual to refer to "streaks" rather than 
longitudinal vortices, although strictly speaking a streak  
 
is merely the visible manifestation of vortices in smoke 
tunnel experiments, and the present specification will 
follow this practice. The drag reduction observed in the experiment 
referred to above may be associated with the ability of 
riblets to limit random spanwise movements of the streaks, 
as has been suggested by a number of sources, e.g. R.E. 
Falco (AIAA-83-0377, AIAA 21st Aerospace Sciences Meeting, 
January 10-13 1983, Reno, Nevada). Johansen and Smith 
(AIAA-85-0547, AIAA-Shear Flow Control Conference, March 
12-14, 1985, Boulder, Colorado) have shown that 
cylindrical riblets of a smaller height than the V-groove 
riblets with which Walsh obtained his optimum results, may 
have the effect of anchoring
