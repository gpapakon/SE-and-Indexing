<ABSTRACT>
A colored plastic lens includes a plastic substrate having first and second surfaces, 
a resin film with a pigment dispersed therein formed on one of the first and second 

surfaces of the plastic substrate, and a coating film, preferably a hard coat film, formed 
on one of the resin film and the surface of the lens on which the resin film is not 

formed. A method of forming the colored plastic lens includes providing a plastic 
substrate having first and second sides, dispersing a pigment in a resin vehicle, coating 

the pigment dispersed in the resin vehicle on one of the first and second sides of the 
plastic substrate to thereby form a resin film, and forming a coating film, preferably a 

hard coat film, on one of the resin film and the surface of the lens on which the resin 
film is not formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a colored plastic lens and method of
manufacturing therefor, and more particularly to a colored plastic lens which does not
discolor during application of a surface hardening film.Plastic lenses have the characteristics of being easy to mold, light-and
crack-resistant,
and easy to color with dyes, so they have become widely used in recent years as
optical lenses, and especially as optical lenses for eyeglasses. The advantage of being
able to easily color plastic lenses with dyes is especially important for eyeglass
fashionability and shading. It has been estimated that at least 70% of the plastic
eyeglass lenses on the market are dyed. That being the case, there is an emerging need
for a high-volume dyeing method which yields uniform, consistent color as well as a large
variety of colors. The most commonly used method for dyeing plastic lenses is the so-called
dip-dyeing method. According to this method, a dye solution is prepared in which
dye is dispersed in a water/surface active agent solution. The plastic lens is dipped in
the dye solution while being heated. As an alternative to the aforementioned dip-dyeing
method, a method of sublimating an organic pigment to color plastic lenses is proposed
in Japanese Patent Publication 35-1384. As another alternative, a method of sublimating
a sublimating dye to color plastic lenses is proposed in Japanese Patent Publication 56-153321,
Japanese Patent Publication 56-159376, and Japanese Patent Publication 1-277814.Because the surface hardness of an unmodified plastic lens is insufficient, there
are disadvantages in that the lens is easily scratched and surface reflection develops due
to the flickering of images and solid objects. To improve surface hardness, a silicon-based
hard coat film is applied to the lens base material, and in order to improve surface 
reflection, inorganic substances are vapor-deposited on the surface of the lens to create a
reflection-preventing film. However, using silicon-based hard coat films and inorganic
reflection-preventing films reduces the impact resistance of the plastic lens.To improve the impact resistance of the plastic lens, it is necessary to improve the
surface by placing a primer layer between the lens base material and the silicon-based
hard coat film. As an example of this method, it has been proposed to use an epoxy
resin as the primer composite (Japanese Patent Publication 60-214301). Alternatively, it
has been proposed to use an acrylic polyol and a multi-functional organic
