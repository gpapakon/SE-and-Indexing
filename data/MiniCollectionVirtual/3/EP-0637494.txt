<ABSTRACT>
The procedure described comprises the application of a nonslip laminar 
layer, preferably made of polyurethane, with a thickness of between 

50 and 300 microns, preferably about 150 microns, to the face of the 
object which is to have nonslip properties, closely joining the 

nonslip film to the surface of the support, preferably by means of 
over-injection in a mould designed for manufacturing the object by 

injection, applying a nonslip film of polyurethane previously cut, 
cleaned and provided with an electrostatic charge, achieving a close 

join between the nonslip polyurethane film and the object being 
manufactured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes a new procedure for 
manufacturing plastic objects provided with nonslip surfaces, and 
further relates to a nonslip tray made according to the procedure of 
the present invention. The main object of the present invention centres on the 
production of objects which can be provided with nonslip surfaces, 
which is particularly useful in the case of many objects used in the 
hotel business and domestically to carry various objects such as 
glasses, plates and other similar elements. Currently, objects of this 
type, such as trays and the like, have surfaces with no special 
nonslip properties, only the properties corresponding to their normal 
surface state as a result of currently known procedures and materials. 
In this respect, it is worth remembering that the materials normally 
used are either metals, with painted or enamelled surfaces, or 
plastics of varying hardness and a smooth surface. Traditionally, 
these objects are given fairly a high surface hardness in order to 
prevent them from being scratched too easily during use, and at the 
same time are manufactured using a simple process so as not to make 
them too expensive. In the case of trays and the like made from a 
painted or enamelled sheet of steel or aluminium, the frictional 
properties are very low, as a result of which their handling 
characteristics are less than satisfactory since when they are used 
in hotels or in the home, there is the continuous problem of the low 
adherence of objects placed on them, giving rise to appreciable 
handling difficulties. Similar problems arise in the case of trays 
made of plastic. The aim of the present invention is a procedure which 
enables the surfaces of various objects, in particular moulded 
objects, to be given nonslip properties, providing satisfactory 
surface properties combined with appreciable nonslip properties, and 
thereby enabling objects placed on trays and other similar elements 
manufactured according to the invention to be handled very easily. The 
procedure of the invention therefore combines a number of highly 
innovative characteristics which enable the above mentioned drawbacks 
of the known techniques to be solved. The main object of the present invention is to coat the  
 
active surface of the object that is to have nonslip properties with 
a film of a nonslip elastomer, preferably an ether-based polyurethane, 
whose thickness varies across a wide range of values, for example 
between 50 and 300 microns, preferably about 150 microns, it

1.- A procedure for manufacturing plastic objects with 
nonslip surfaces, characterized in that it comprises the application 

of a nonslip laminar layer, preferably made of polyurethane, with a 
thickness of between 50 and 300 microns, preferably about 150 microns, 

to the face of the object which is to have nonslip properties, closely 
joining the nonslip film to the surface of the plastic support, 

preferably by means of over-injection in a mould designed for 
manufacturing the object by injection, applying a nonslip film of 

polyurethane previously cut, cleaned and provided with an 
electrostatic charge, achieving a close join between the nonslip 

polyurethane film and the object being manufactured. 
2. A procedure for manufacturing plastic objects with 
nonslip surfaces according to claim 1, characterized in that the 

nonslip film is prepared by joining a laminar paper support or the 
like to a layer of polyurethane to prepare bobbins designed for 

cutting up the laminar pieces which are designed to be placed in the 
mould prior to the injection stage. 
3. A tray with nonslip properties, of the type which 
comprises a laminar support body provided with a peripheral rim and/or 

handles for holding said tray, characterized in that the entire 
surface on which objects are supported is coated with a thin layer of 

polyurethane whose upper surface on which the objects to be carried 
are placed is completely smooth. 
4. A tray with nonslip properties according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the surface layer of polyurethane extends over 

the entire visible upper surface of the tray, including the entire 
peripheral rim. 
5. A tray with nonslip properties, characterized in that 
the surface on which the objects to be carried are placed is provided 

with a nonslip layer whose upper face is provided with micro-incisions 
in order to increase the coefficient of friction. 
6. A nonslip plastic tray manufactured according to the 
procedure defined in claims 1 and 2.
