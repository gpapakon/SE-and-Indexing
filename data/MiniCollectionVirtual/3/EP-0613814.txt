<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transmission lock for bicycles, consisting of a closing and locking system for blocking rotational movement of the pedal shaft and securing its axial position in the bottom bracket ball bearing housing. The invention is based on the object of developing a transmission lock for bicycles which in its closed state blocks the rotational movement of the pedal shaft and which cannot be opened or removed from the bottom bracket ball bearing housing without considerable damage to the bicycle frame. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that a diametrical recess (8) is present in a pedal shaft (3) in the axial direction behind an axial keyhole (7) which starts at a pin (3a) of the pedal shaft (3), there being arranged in the said recess (8) a closing and locking system whose closing bolt (14) engages in its closed position in a frame tube of the bicycle frame.

A drive lock for bicycles, comprising a locking 
system to prevent the pedal shaft from rotating and fix 

it in the axial position thereof in the pedal shaft 
housing, characterized in that, as viewed in the axial 

direction of a pedal shaft (3), behind an axial key bore 
(7) starting from a pivot (3a) of said pedal shaft (3), 

a diametral recess (8) is provided in which a locking 
system and a blocking system are arranged, the latch 

(14) of which penetrates into a tube of the bicycle 
frame in the locking position. 
A drive lock for bicycles as recited in claim 1, 
characterized in that a cylinder lock (11) with locking 

pins is positioned as locking system in the diametral 
recess (8) in the pedal shaft (3) provided with said key 

bore (7), and is supported in a socket bore (10a) for a 
lock socket (10) fixed in said diametral recess (8), 

said socket bore being in alignment with said key bore 
(7), so that said cylinder lock is able to be rotated 

with the help of a key, but is able to be fixedly snapped 
in the unlocked position and in the locked position, 

and is attached to the locking system through an eccentric 
disk (12) positioned on said cylinder lock (11) and 

provided with an eccentric pivot (13) engaging a guiding 
groove (14a) in a locking latch (14). 
A drive lock for bicycles as recited in claim 1 
or 2, characterized in that said guiding groove (14a) in 

the locking latch (14) has the shape of a straight line, 
a curved line or a combined shape thereof, and said guiding 

groove (14a) comprises preferably a portion shaped 
as an arc of a circle corresponding in diameter with 

said eccentric pivot (13), and a successive rectilinear 
portion, for one complete revolution of the key. 
A drive lock for bicycles as recited in claims  
 

to 3, characterized in that in said socket bore (10a), 
a protecting disk (15) is positioned in the lock socket 

(10) ahead of said cylinder lock (11) as viewed in the 
direction of insertion of the key, and has a central 

opening matching the profile of the key, such that said 
protecting disk is able to rotate freely or under a 

slight braking action from a resilient disk (16). 
A drive lock for bicycles as recited in claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that said locking latch (14) 

penetrates into the lower tube (1) of the bicycle frame 
in the locked position. 
A drive lock for bicycles as recited in claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that said diametral recess (8) 

in the pedal shaft (3) has the shape of an elongated 
hole, similar to that of a transverse slot.
