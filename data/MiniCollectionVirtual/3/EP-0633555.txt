<ABSTRACT>
A label (10) for packaged products (
P
) about which 
information is to be provided with the package includes 

a bottom layer (11) of imprintable material having an 
adhesive coating (12) on one surface thereof and indicia 

(13) pre-printed on the other surface thereof, and an 
upper layer (15) of clear plastic film laminated to the 

bottom layer (11) at opposite end portions (16,17) 
thereof and substantially covering the printed surface of 

said bottom layer (11), the upper layer (15) having a 
window (30) die cut therein to expose a portion (14) of 

the surface of the bottom layer (11) through the plastic

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to labels to be 
applied to packages of products and more particularly 
to labels having indicia pre-printed thereon, which 
indicia are covered and protected by a clear plastic 
film. Various and sundry products are packaged for 
sale to consumers in boxes, bottles and the like. In 
most instances, it has been the practice to apply pre-printed 
labels to such product packaging. Typically, 
such labels have an adhesive coating on the back 
surface thereon to adhere the label to the product 
package. The front surface of these labels is usually 
pre-printed with indicia to impart information about 
the product to consumers and other interested persons. For many applications, such as 
pharmaceuticals, it is considered desirable to cover 
the printed surface of such labels with a clear plastic 
film. It is also desirable with some products, e.g. 
pharmaceuticals, to include with the product an 
information booklet containing considerably more 
information about the product than can be imprinted on 
the label. A label having a clear plastic film outer 
layer and an imprintable inner layer has been proposed 
and in which a pocket is provided in the label. The 
informational booklet is removably contained in this 
pocket. Example of prior art labels of this 
type are disclosed in US-A-4 991 878 
and EP-A-0 382 398. While such prior labels have been successful 
in solving certain problems, they have deficiencies and  
 
disadvantages which have limited their adoption and 
use. Among these deficiencies and disadvantages is the 
problem of printing additional indicia on the label at 
or near the time of application of the labels to the 
packages. In many labeling operations, there is a need 
or requirement that additional indicia, such as 
specific lot numbers, expiration dates, etc., be 
printed on the label at or near the time of label 
application. However, the plastic film covering the 
imprintable layer of the label can not be readily 
imprinted. Accordingly, users of these prior labels 
have had to take special steps to add such indicia to 
the product package since it could not be printed on 
the label. With the foregoing in mind, it is an object 
of the present invention to provide a label which 
overcomes the deficiencies and disadvantages of labels 
heretofore available. The present invention is as defined in claim 1 thereof. 
The upper layer may be laminated or 
adhesively secured to the bottom layer only at opposite 
end portions with the medial portion of said upper 
layer
