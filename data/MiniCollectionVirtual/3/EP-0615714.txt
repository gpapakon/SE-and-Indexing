<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for beverage preparation and, in particular, 
to an apparatus which incorporates as an integral 
part thereof a beverage package containing leaf tea 
or ground coffee which is intended to provide an 
infusion of tea or coffee, respectively. The production of freshly brewed tea or coffee 
involves contacting tea leaves or roast and ground 
coffee with hot water and separating the beverage 
from the tea leaves or coffee grounds. Various 
methods for the production of freshly brewed coffee 
or tea are well known. For example, tea is prepared 
traditionally in a teapot, the tea leaves being 
immersed in boiling water and allowed to stand before 
being poured from the pot. Freshly brewed coffee may 
be prepared by the continuous passage of hot water 
through roast and ground coffee contained in a filter 
and the coffee collected in a jug or other 
receptacle, or by percolation which involves the 
continuous recycling of water through the roast and 
ground coffee. It has previously been proposed to seal fresh 
roast and ground coffee or tea leaves in individual 
air-impermeable packages. For example, cartridges or 
capsules containing compacted ground coffee are known 
for use in certain coffee making machines which are 
generally termed "espresso" machines. In the 
production of coffee using these coffee machines the 
coffee cartridge is placed in a brewing chamber and 
hot water is generally caused to pass under pressure 
through the cartridge, thereby extracting the 
aromatic coffee constitutents from the ground coffee 
and producing a coffee beverage. Cartridges containing roast and ground coffee in  
 
which hot water flows under gravimetric force through 
the cartridge are also known. A cartridge of this 
general type is described in British Patent No. 
1397116. The cartridges for use in "espresso" machines and 
those through which water flows under gravimetric 
force contain a filter positioned beneath the charge 
of coffee. In the production of coffee from these 
cartridges water is generally injected into the 
coffee containing cartridge through a needle. The 
cartridge is filled with water which flows through 
the filter and is collected in a cup or other 
receptacle. It is also well known to package leaf tea or 
ground coffee in so called tea bags or coffee bags 
which generally comprise leaf tea or ground coffee 
enclosed between two pieces of a filter material 
which are sealed around their edges to form a bag. Another method of brewing

An apparatus for the preparation of a 
beverage, which apparatus comprises a plunger adapted 

to fit tightly into a receptacle for the preparation 
of the beverage and a water-permeable beverage 

package containing one or more beverage preparation 
ingredients attached to the plunger, the plunger 

comprising a handle and a plunger body attached to 
the handle, the plunger being provided with means for 

the attachment of the said beverage package thereto. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the plunger body is provided with a U-shaped annular 

downwardly extending flange which is adapted to fit 
into a complementary U-shaped channel formed on the 

said beverage package. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein 
the beverage package comprises a rigid side wall with 

a water-permeable material sealed to the top and 
bottom of the side wall and the beverage 

ingredient(s) being contained in the space 
therebetween, the beverage package having a U-shaped 

channel surrounding the side wall into which the 
annular flange formed on the plunger body is adapted 

to fit. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the beverage package is located in a beverage package 

holder which is adapted to screw into the plunger 
body. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 4 wherein 
the screw fitting is of the bayonnet type. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the beverage package is located in a beverage package 

holder which push fits onto the plunger body. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 
4 to 6 wherein the beverage package is provided with 

a lip or rim which fits over the edge of the beverage 
package holder to hold the said package in position. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the handle of the plunger is provided with a 

plurality of retractable claws which are adapted in 
their retracted position to locate through a 

complementary hole formed in a beverage package and 
in their expanded position to engage beneath an 

annular rim formed around the hole of the beverage 
package. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 8 wherein 
the handle of the plunger is hollow and the movement 

of the claws from the retracted to the expanded 
position is effected by means of a moveable spindle 

located in the hollow handle of the plunger. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the plunger body is provided with a plurality of 

claws which are adapted to engage beneath an annular 
rim formed around the periphery of a beverage package. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 10 wherein 
the claws are adapted to move from a first open 

position to a second position in which they engage 
beneath the annular rim formed around the periphery 

of the beverage package by means of a spring loaded 
mechanism. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the beverage package 

contains leaf tea or ground coffee. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims in combination with a receptacle for 

the preparation of the beverage into which the 
plunger is adapted to fit tightly. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 13 wherein 
the receptacle is a jug or pressure pot. 
A method for the preparation of a beverage 
which comprises filling a receptacle with boiling or 

near boiling water to a desired level, inserting into 
the receptacle a plunger which is adapted to fit 

tightly therein, the plunger having a beverage 
package containing one or more beverage ingredients 

attached thereto, allowing the beverage ingredients 
to infuse in and become wetted by the water, and 

thereafter depressing the plunger to cause the water 
to flow through the beverage package. 
A method as claimed in claim 15 wherein the 
plunger and beverage package are as defined in any 

one of claims 2 to 11.
