<ABSTRACT>
Braking device and piezoelectric operating pump for motor vehicles comprising:     - a receiver actuated via fluid pressure,   - a piezoelectric pump (5) for pressurising the fluid,   - a fluid reservoir (8) for feeding the said pump, - valves (6,7) for controlling the pressure of the fluid delivered by the pump,   - a member for actuating the receiver, - sensors (9,10) for sensing the pressure of the fluid at various points in a hydraulic circuit, and a central signal-processing unit (3), characterised in that the member for actuating the receiver delivers an operating signal to the central unit located between the said actuating member and the pump, which is driven from the said central unit via an electric power supply unit (4) in conjunction with the control valves (6,7) by signals E1 delivered by the actuating member, by signals E2, E3 coming from sensors for sensing the pressure of the fluid, and by signals E4 which are characteristic of the dynamics of the wheel for the purpose of providing optimum braking of the vehicle.

A braking device and piezoelectric control pump for automobile vehicles, 
comprising: 


a receiver actuated by a fluid pressure, 
a piezoelectric pump (5) for pressurising the fluid, 
a tank (8) for supplying fluid to this pump, 
valves (6, 7) for controlling the pressure of the fluid supplied by the pump, 
an actuation member for the receiver, 
pressure sensors (9, 10) for the fluid at different points of the hydraulic braking 
circuit, 
 
and a central signal processing unit (3), the receiver actuation member supplying a 

control signal to the central unit disposed between the actuation member and the pump, 
which is driven by the central unit via an electrical supply unit (4) together with the 

control valves (6, 7), mounted respectively between the tank (8) and the pump (5) and 
between this pump (5) and a receiver, in response to signals E1 supplied by the 

actuation member, in response to signals E2, E3 from fluid pressure sensors (9, 10) 
respectively detecting the pressure in the fluid compression chamber (19) and the 

pressure exerted by the fluid on a receiver and in response to signals E4 characteristic of 
the wheel dynamics. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the pump (5) comprises a 
piezoelectric stack (13) with ceramic disks (14), wherein an end disk is rigid with a 

vibrating diaphragm (16) which bounds, together with a yoke (18) having fluid inlet and 
outlet openings (25, 26), the fluid compression chamber (19). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the piezoelectric stack (13) 
is disposed in a cavity of a pump body (17) and in that the other end disk is rigid with 

the pump body.  
 
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the yoke (18), the pump 
body (17) and the diaphragm (16) are connected by an annular weld adapted to render 

the compression chamber leak-tight. 
A device as claimed in claim 2, 3 or 4, characterised in that the pump body (17) 
and the yoke (18) are disposed between two flanges connected together by tie-rods (24). 
A piezoelectric control pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it is integrated between a tank (8) and a receiver of a braking device 

of an automobile vehicle wheel.
