Method for reducing nitrogen oxides in the 
exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine (1, 14) by 

adsorption of the nitrogen oxides in an adsorber (6), 
which is arranged together with a further exhaust-gas 

cleaning device (7) in the course of an exhaust-gas line 
(3) of the internal combustion engine (1, 14), and 

subsequent desorption of the nitrogen oxides by means of 
a hot gas followed by admixture of the nitrogen oxides to 

the intake air of the internal combustion engine (1, 14) 
and reaction of the nitrogen oxide in the combustion 

space to give nitrogen (N
2
) and oxygen (O
2
), characterized 
in that the nitrogen oxides are alternately adsorbed 

and desorbed in one adsorber (6) and the exhaust-gas 
cleaning device connected in parallel with this in the 

exhaust-gas line and designed as a further adsorber (7). 
Apparatus for executing the method according to 
Claim 1 with an internal combustion engine (1), an 

exhaust-gas line (3) which leads away from the internal 
combustion engine (1) and in the course of which an 

exhaust-gas cleaning device and an adsorber (6) for the 
adsorption of nitrogen oxides from the exhaust gas of the 

internal combustion engine (1) are provided, furthermore 
with an induction line (2) for feeding intake air into 

the combustion spaces of the internal combustion engine 
(1) and with at least one recirculation line (11), which 

branches off from the exhaust-gas line (3) downstream of 
the adsorber (6) via a recirculation valve (9, 10) and is 

connected to the induction line (2), characterized in 
that, at some point along its length, the exhaust-gas 

line (3) is divided into two parallel exhaust-gas branch  
 

lines (4, 5), the adsorber (6) being arranged in one 
exhaust-gas branch line (4 or 5) and the exhaust-gas 

cleaning device designed as an adsorber (7) being 
arranged in the other exhaust-gas branch line (4 or 5), 

in that a control valve (8) is arranged upstream of the 
adsorbers (6, 7) to direct the stream of exhaust gas into 

one of the exhaust-gas branch lines (4, 5), and in that 
a recirculation line (11) controlled by means of 

recirculation valves (9, 10) forms a branch in each 
exhaust-gas branch line (4, 5) and is connected to the 

induction line (2). 
Method for reducing nitrogen oxides in the

adsorption of the nitrogen oxides in an adsorber (18), 
which is arranged together with a further exhaust-gas

(16) of the internal combustion engine (14), and subsequent 

desorption of the nitrogen oxides by means of a

type internal combustion engine (14), the 
exhaust-gas cleaning device is a catalytic converter

with excess air in the adsorption phase and, for the 
desorption phase, with a stoichiometric or approximately 

stoichiometric mixture, and in that in the desorption 
phase a quantitatively small stream of exhaust gas is fed 

to the adsorber (18), while the remaining, main stream of 
exhaust gas is admitted directly to the catalytic converter

Claim 3 with a mixture-compression type internal combustion 

engine (14), an exhaust-gas line (16) which leads
