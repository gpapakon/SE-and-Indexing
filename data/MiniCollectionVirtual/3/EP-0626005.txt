<ABSTRACT>
Solid, pourable powdered and/or granulated concentrates of anionic surface active agents, which may also constitute compounds admixed with other auxiliary and/or valuable substances suitable for washing and/or cleaning agents, are produced by drying corresponding aqueous compositions until the powder and/or granulate is produced. The teaching of the invention is characterized by the design of the concentrates as a dust-free material, in which the anionic surface active compounds are available at least partially as their washing and/or cleaning active salts. The concentrates of anionic surface active agents have settled apparent densities of at least 150 g/l approximately and are produced by hot-drying the aqueous compositions with overheated steam as the drying gas. Preferred settled apparent densities lie above 200 g/l approximately, in particular around 350 g/l at least. In addition, the bulk and pourable material is preferably designed as a substantially dust-free material thanks to the use of dust-binding auxiliary and/or valuable substances and/or to the regulation of the residual water content. In a preferred embodiment, the concentrate of anionic surface active agents is designed as a porous carrier bead with an absorbent porous inner structure.

Anionic surfactant concentrates in the form of solid free-flowing 
powders and/or granules which may also be present as compounds in 

admixture with other auxiliaries and/or useful materials suitable for use in 
detergents and/or cleaning products and which have been produced by the 

drying of corresponding water-based preparations to form the powders and/or 
granules, characterized in that they are in the form of a dust-free, pourable 

and free-flowing material, contain the anionic surfactant compounds in the 
form of their washing- and/or cleaning-active salts, their anionic surfactant 

content being at least 30% by weight, have apparent densities of at least 150 
g/l and have been produced by hot drying of the water-containing preparations 

with superheated steam as the drying gas, the dry product produced 
by spray-drying of an aqueous fatty alcohol sulfate paste (water content about 

41% by weight, mixed with 5% by weight of soda) in superheated steam as 
the drying gas stream containing residual water of about 6% being excluded here.

in that they have apparent densities above about 200 g/l, preferably above 

about 300 g/l and, more preferably, above 350 g/l. 
Anionic surfactant concentrates as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that they are in the form of a dust-free material through the 

co-use of dust-binding auxiliaries and/or useful materials and/or by regulation 
of the residual water content. 
Anionic surfactant concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 3,

by weight, preferably at most about 4% by weight and, more particularly, in 
the range from about 1 to 3% by weight. 
Anionic surfactant concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that they have a content of washing- and/or cleaning-active 

anionic surfactants of 35 to 95% by weight and, in particularly preferred 
embodiments, the content of anionic surfactant components makes up more  

 
than 50% by weight, based on fine-particle solids. 
Anionic surfactant concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that they contain as the dust-binding auxiliaries and/or useful 

materials mixture components - preferably in the form of a homogeneous 
mixture - which are liquid and/or at least tacky at room temperature, optionally 

in the presence of limited quantities of residual water, and which are 
preferably incorporated in the surfactant concentrate in such quantities that 

the necessary freedom from dust is guaranteed without a lasting adverse 
effect on pourability and free flow. 
Anionic surfactant concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 6,

and/or polymeric mixture components soluble, emulsifiable and/or swellable
