<ABSTRACT>
In order to allow connection of composite signals or of "Y-C" signals, according to the moments, on the input of a single circuit, in the case in which the circuit (18) is of the type with "Y-C" input (two separate terminals), a filter (16) eliminating the chrominance signal is inserted into the "Y" input and a filter (17) eliminating the luminance signal is inserted into the "C" input, while, in the case where this circuit (11) is of the composite-input type, its input is linked to a "Y"-type signal source (14) by a bridge of two resistors (13, 21) in series, and the mid point of this bridge is linked to a "C"-type signal source (19) by a resonant-type series inductance-capacitance circuit (9, 10) which is tuned to the frequency of the chrominance subcarrier. Applications: television sets offering a choice among several sources of different types of image.
