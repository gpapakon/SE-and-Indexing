<ABSTRACT>
A solid-state electrolytic capacitor reduces 
possibility of causing failure due to increasing of a leak 

current during application of voltage for a long period and 
thus improve reliability. In the solid-state electrolytic 

capacitor has a conductive high polymeric compound (3) 
deposited on a dielectric oxidation layer (2) covering the 

surface of pore (1a) in a tantalum plate with maintaining 
void (7). The void surface act as an oxygen supply source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tantalum solid-state 
electrolytic capacitor and a fabrication process therefor, 
more particularly to a tantalum solid-state electrolytic 
capacitor in which a conductive high polymeric compound 
formed through chemical oxidation polymerization as a solid-state 
electrolyte. In general, tantalum solid-state electrolytic capacitor 
is constituted of a sintered body obtained through sintering 
of tantalum powder, a tantalum oxide layer formed on the 
surface of the sintered body, a solid-state electrolyte on 
the tantalum oxide layer, and a conductive layer, such as 
graphite layer, silver layer and so forth formed on the 
solid-state electrolyte. The capacitor is polarized, in 
which a metal tantalum generally becomes an anode side 
electrode and the conductive layer on the solid-state 
electrolyte becomes a cathode side electrode. Here, as the solid-state electrolyte, manganese dioxide 
has conventionally been frequently used. However, in the 
recent years, for the purpose of improvement of capacitor 
characteristics and reliability, there has been proposed the 
solid-state electrolyte formed of conductive high polymeric 
compound, such as polypyrrole and so forth in place of the 
manganese dioxide. Such proposal has been disclosed in 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. Heisei 4-56445 
(Japanese Patent Application No. Showa 58-144374), for 
example. The solid-state electrolytic capacitor employing the 
conductive high polymeric compound as the solid-state 
electrolyte has the following superior characteristics in 
comparison with that employing the manganese dioxide, as 
pointed out in the foregoing publication.  
 
(1) Since the conductivity of the conductive high polymeric 
compound is several tens times greater than that of the 
manganese dioxide, it has excellent high frequency 
characteristics. Therefore, the conductive high 
polymeric compound attracts attentions for capability 
of adaption for recent rising of operation frequency of 
the electronic devices. (2) As pointed out in the above-identified publication, 
since in the capacitor employing the manganese dioxide, 
the manganese dioxide is produced by pyrolysis of 
manganese nitrate, thermal stress of 200 to 300 °C is 
applied to the sintered body (already formed with the 
surface oxide layer) during production process. 
Therefore, defect in the surface oxide layer can be 
caused to increase leak current. In contrast to this, 
the capacitor employing the conductive high polymeric 
compound as
