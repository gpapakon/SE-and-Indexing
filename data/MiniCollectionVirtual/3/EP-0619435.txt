with the aid of a screwed assembly traversing the laminated glazing,


characterized in that
 at least one first and one second glass sheets (2, 3)
constituting the laminated glazing (1), prior to being assembled with the

thermoplastic spacer (4), are each provided with a hole (15) respectively
(16), so that they are eccentric to one another following the manufacture of

the laminated glazing (1), 
in that
 a centring sleeve (8) is inserted in the
hole (15) of the first glass sheet (2), 
in that
 the space within the wall of
the hole (16) of the second glass sheet (3) is then filled with hardenable

adhesive (20) and then 
in that
