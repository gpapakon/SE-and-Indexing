<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotary drive (1) for a control unit, having a rotary spring (5) which is used both for return motion and for latching. The rotary spring (5) is mounted concentrically in the link (3) of the rotary drive (1) and is stressed inwards by an outer guide (10) which is formed by the collar (2). The rotary spring end (6,7), which is deflected by a cutout (14) in the link (3), latches in a latching depression (11) in the collar (2). When rotated in the opposite direction, the latching is overcome via a tangential return surface (8) on the cutout (14).

Rotary drive for an electric switch which 
comprises a collar (2), a rotatable link (3) and a 

slide (4) and also has the following features: 

a) the rotary drive (1) comprises a torsion 
spring (5) with two spring ends (6, 7) 

projecting in a wing-like manner; 
b) the torsion spring (5) is mounted 
concentrically relative to the link (3); 
c) in the non-actuated zero position of the 
rotary drive, under a pre-tension which 

extends the torsion spring diameter, the 
first spring end (6) is stayed on a fixed 

portion (2) and the second spring end (7) is 
stayed on a rotatable guide portion (3); 
d) in the case of actuation of the rotary drive 
(1), the torsion spring (5) is deflected by 

way of its second spring end (7) by means of 
the rotatable guide portion (3), in which 

case a concentric outer guide (10) tensions 
the second spring end (7) inwards; 
e) the outer guide (10) is provided with a stop 
trap (11) which is realized by means of 

diameter enlargement and into which the 
second spring end (7) springs and is engaged 

in the case of actuation on account of the 
outwardly directed force which acts on it in 

consequence of the spring tension; 
f) the engagement can be released by exerting a 
rotary force in the direction of the zero 

position by way of a rotatable tangential 
return face (8), for example on the link (3), 

which face acts on the engaged second spring 
end (7), owing to the fact that the face 

exerts on the second spring end (7) a force 
which is directed towards the central point  

 
of the torsion spring (5). 
Rotary drive according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the torsion spring (5) has at 

least one circular winding (12) and in that the two 
spring ends (6, 7) leave the circular form tangentially 

or on a radius outwards up to a certain distance, are 
then bent off at right angles in opposite directions 

and end as two wire pieces which extend so as to be 
parallel to the axis of the torsion spring. 
Rotary drive according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the windings (12) of the torsion 

spring (5) enclose an inner guide (9) with little 
clearance. 
Rotary drive according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the inner guide is formed 

by the link (3). 
Rotary drive according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the collar (2) has a free 

cross section (13). 
Rotary drive according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the fixed portion (2) has 

an area (19) with reduced diameter, is realized with a 
radially extending transition zone (18) and pertains to 

the collar (2). 
Rotary drive according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the concentric outer 

guide is formed by means of a circular, stepped 
shoulder (10) in the collar (2), arranged above which 

shoulder there is the rotatable guide portion (3) which 
for the purpose of staying the second spring end (7) 

has a cutout (14) as a trap which is open towards the 
windings (12) of the torsion spring (5) and which 

extends in part beyond the stepped shoulder (10) so 
that the second spring end (7) in the event of 

deflection of the torsion spring is guided by means of 
a radial transition zone (21) (sic) on the cutout (14)  

 
at the shoulder (10) and upon reaching the stop trap 

(11) springs into the cutout (14). 
Rotary drive according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the cutout (14) is 

provided with the tangential return face (8). 
Rotary drive according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the features which have 

been mentioned are also provided for both directions of 
rotation. 
Rotary drive according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a filling piece 

is inserted into the stop trap (11).
