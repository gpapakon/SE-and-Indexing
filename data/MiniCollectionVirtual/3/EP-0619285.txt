<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing polymeric gasolines and jet fuel from
saturated c4 hydrocarbon fractions.The exploitation of C4 fractions obtained as a
byproduct from FCC (catalytic cracking on fluidized
bed = fluid catalytic cracking) and steam cracking is
becoming an increasingly serious problem in petroleum
and petrochemical industries. In particular,
interesting is the exploitation of the paraffinic
fraction, and, mainly, of n-butane, remaining as a
residue after the treatments for recovery and
exploitation of olefins (e.g., separation of
butadiene, esterification of isobutene and methyl-t-butyl-ether,
oligomerization and alkylation of
isobutane and n-butenes). In particular, in
GB-A-2 246 524, n-butane is used
in a process for obtaining isobutene-containing
olefinic fractions, which constitutes a valuable
intermediate useable in such chemical reactions as
polymerizations and alkylations, and in isoprene
production. The catalyst used for this transformation
is based on platinum supported on silica-added
alumina, possibly in mixture with a solid acidic
catalyst selected from silica-added alumina or
boralite B.The present Applicant has found now a process
which makes it possible C4 paraffinic fractions,
essentially constituted by n-butane, to be utilized, 
by converting them into valuable hydrocarbonaceous
fractions suitable as engine fuels.Several processes are known for preparing
hydrocarbon fractions useful as fuels, by starting
from light C3-C4 olefins in the presence of solid
acidic catalysts.In U.S. 3,960,978; EP-31,675 and U.S. 4,150,062
the use is claimed of zeolites of ZSM-5 type, in order
to produce gasolines by olefins oligomerization.
Unfortunately, the so obtained gasolines also contain
a fraction of aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly benzene.
Such substances are obviously undesirable, owing to
their harmfulness to man.In U.S. 4,227,992; U.S. 4,456,779 and U.S.
4,720,600, processes for light olefins
oligomerization, catalyzed by zeolites of ZSM-5 type,
are disclosed, which make it possible products
to be obtained which contain a useful hydrocarbon
fraction for use as jet and diesel fuel. However,
these processes require that decidedly high
temperatures, i.e., of at least 250°C, are used.At present, from an industrial viewpoint, the
most widely used catalyst for producing polymeric
gasolines is constituted by supported phosphoric acid
(J. F. Mc Mahon et al., "Polymerization of olefins as
a refinery process", Adv. Pet. Chem., Volume VII,
1963, pages 285-321). This
