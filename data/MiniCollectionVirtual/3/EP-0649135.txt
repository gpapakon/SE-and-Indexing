<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical memory
medium wherein high density recording is performed on the
surface of a substrate through optically produced chemical
changes on the surface of the substrate, an optical recording
apparatus having a microscopic aperture for performing
optical recording with high density and an apparatus for
reading information from changes in the frictional force on
the surface of the memory medium.Conventional high density memory media include magnetic
disks, optical disks, magneto-optical disks and the like. A
magnetic disk is a flat plate applied with a magnetic
substance and is written and read by a magnetic head. Since
a magnetic disk is magnetized in a horizontal direction,
there is a need for preventing magnetic fields from
overlapping each other, which has imposed a certain limit on
efforts to obtain higher density. Optical disks and magneto-optical
disks were developed in an attempt to allow recording
with higher density. In the case of an optical disk, a raw
disk is made by means of exposure to laser beams; a master
disk is made by means of electroforming from the raw disk; 
and a replica disk is made by means of injection molding from
the master disk. Reading is performed using variations in
the reflectance of laser beams which depends on each bit.
A magneto-optical disk is obtained by forming a thin film of
a vertically magnetized material on a flat plate formed with
pits for tracks. To perform writing on the magneto-optical
disk, vertical magnetized spots are written into it by
applying magnetic fields thereto in a vertical direction,
with heating of spots irradiated by laser beams maintained
above the Curie-point. Reading is performed by directing
laser beams and utilizing changes in the polarization angle
of the reflected laser beams which depend on the direction of
the magnetization of the spots.Laser beams are used to read bits in both of optical
disks and magneto-optical disks which are high density
optical memory media. The bit size is limited by the
diameter of a spot to which a laser beam is converged and the
minimum size is on the order of the wavelength of light,
i.e., 1 µm. Nature, vol. 359, pp. 133 - 135, R. M. Overney et al., "Friction measurements on
