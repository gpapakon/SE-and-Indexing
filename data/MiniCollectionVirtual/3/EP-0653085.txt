<ABSTRACT>
A method of calculating a combination of coins to be dispensed as change comprises evaluating different possible combinations and selecting the most favourable one. One combination is determined according to priority, giving higher priority to higher-denomination coins. In other combinations, the number of coins of one or more denominations is one less than would be determined by priority.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of, and an 
apparatus for, controlling the dispensing of money in 
the form of units having a plurality of denominations. 
The invention is particularly, but not exclusively, 
applicable to machines such as vending machines which 
receive coins of a plurality of denominations, and 
which have a plurality of stores each containing coins 
of a respective denomination, and each possibly being 
capable of being replenished by insertion of coins 
into the vending machine. Means are provided for 
dispensing coins from the stores in an amount which 
corresponds to the difference between the amount 
inserted, and the value of the vend or vends performed 
by the machine. The invention is not limited to such 
arrangements. The dispensed monetary units could be, 
for example, banknotes, or a mixture of banknotes and 
coins. The invention also has wider applicability 
than vending machines; it may be applied to change-giving 
machines of any type. In the field of vending machines, it is well 
known to use a dispensing control means which 
calculates a preferred combination of coins for  
 
dispensing in the form of change. One typical way of 
achieving this, referred to as the "least number of 
coins" method, involves determining the total amount 
of change to be dispensed, calculating the maximum 
number of coins of the highest available denomination 
which in total have a value of equal to or less than 
the amount to be dispensed, deducting this amount to 
obtain a residual amount to be dispensed, taking the 
next lower denomination and determining the maximum 
number of coins which in total are equal to or less 
than this residual amount, deducting this total from 
the residual amount, and continuing using 
progressively smaller denominations until either the 
residual amount is equal to zero or the lowest 
denomination has been used. The object of this 
technique is to use as many higher-denomination coins 
as possible, so that the total number of dispensed 
coins is minimised. This maximises the number of 
coins retained in the stores so that change remains 
available for the maximum number of transactions. It is important that the calculation of the 
combination of coins to be dispensed takes place 
quickly, so as not unduly to delay the user of the 
machine. In the past, this calculation has taken 
place at the same time as the dispensing. Thus, the 
highest value coins would be dispensed in turn, until  
 
the remaining amount to be dispensed became less than 
a single

Apparatus for controlling the dispensing of 
money in the form of monetary units having a plurality 

of denominations, the apparatus comprising: 

(i) first means for determining a desired 
total for a combination of monetary units; 
(ii) second means for determining one 
combination of monetary units, having a total value 

equal to the desired total, by giving priority to 
units in order of denomination, with the highest 

denomination having the highest priority, and for 
determining a further combination of monetary units; 

and 
(iii) third means for comparing the 
combinations formed and for selecting one of said 

combinations for use when dispensing; 
 
   characterised in that the second means is adapted 

to determine said further combination to also have a 
total value equal to the desired total, which further 

combination is formed using the same priority except 
that the number of units for one denomination, which 

is higher than the lowest denomination, is equal to 
one less than that determined according to priority. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein a  
 

plurality of further combinations are formed, each 
using the same priority except that in each case the 

number of units of a respective denomination is one 
less than determined according to priority.

apparatus is operable to form further combinations in 

each of which the number of units of each of a 
plurality of denominations is one less than determined 

according to priority. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
selected combination is selected from combinations in 

which the number of units of each denomination is 
determined according to said priority, or in which the 

number of units of at least one of the denominations 
(excluding the lowest denomination) is one less than 

that determined according to priority in which case 
lower denomination units are then allocated according 

to priority or (except for the lowest denomination) 
one less than determined by priority. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the selection is performed such that the 

combination which comprises the fewest number of 
monetary units is selected.  

 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the apparatus is also operable to determine 

different combinations of monetary units which in 
total substantially correspond, but are not equal to, 

the desired total. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein the 
apparatus is operable for particular dispensing 

operations, depending on the desired total and the 
available monetary units, to determine only 

combinations which do not total to equal the desired 
total, the selection in these circumstances being 

performed in such a manner that a combination which 
has a total value closest to, but less than, the 

desired total is selected. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
in which the apparatus is operable to determine the 

combinations by performing the following steps in the 
named order: 


(a) determining a first combination on the basis 
of said priority; 
(b) establishing a residual dispense value by 
summing the value of a single monetary unit of a 

restore denomination which is greater than the lowest 
of the denominations in the first combination, and the  

 
total values of all coins of the first combination 

which have a denomination lower than the restore 
denomination; and 
(c) forming a second combination using the same 
units as the first combination for denominations 

higher than said restore denomination, using for said 
restore denomination the same number of units as used 

in said first combination minus one, and using said 
priority and said residual dispense value for the or 

each denomination lower than the restore denomination. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8, the 
apparatus being operable to form a third combination 

by repeating steps (b) and (c), substituting the 
second combination for the first combination and using 

a restore denomination lower than the one used to form 
the second combination. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8, the 
apparatus being operable to repeat steps (b) and (c) 

to form additional second combinations, using 
progressively higher restore denominations. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 10, the 
apparatus being operable to determine third 

combinations by, for each of the second combinations,  
 

repeating steps (b) and (c), substituting the 
respective second combination for the first 

combination and using a restore denomination which is 
lower that the restore denomination used to form the 

respective second combination. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 10 or 11, the 
apparatus being operable to terminate the forming of 

combinations in response to determining that all 
appropriate combinations have been formed which use, 

for the highest denomination used in the first 
combination, one less than the number of units used to 

form the first combination. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
the apparatus being operable to determine when there 

is no combination which in total equals the desired 
total, and to provide in response thereto an 

indication to a user that a desired amount cannot be 
dispensed. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
the apparatus being operable to determine that a 

monetary unit required for the selected combination is 
not available, and in response thereto to determine a 

revised desired total representing the remaining  

 
amount desired to be used, and then selecting a new 

combination of monetary units to permit use of the 
revised desired total. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
the apparatus being operable to retain units not 

selected for use in such a way as to permit their use 
in a subsequent operation. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, 
wherein said means for determining one combination and 

said means for determining a further combination each 
comprise means for generating a respective combination 

by performing calculations using the values of the 
coins forming the combination. 
Apparatus for dispensing money in the form 
of units having a plurality of denominations, the 

apparatus having store means for storing the units, 
dispense means for dispensing the units from the store 

means, and apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim 
for controlling the dispense means. 
A vending machine having means for 
accumulating a credit value, means permitting a user 

to select a vend, means for calculating the difference  
 

between the credit value and a price corresponding to 
the vend in order to determine a desired total 

representing a desired amount to be dispensed as 
change, and apparatus as claimed in claim 17 for 

dispensing said change. 
A method of controlling the dispensing of 
money in the form of monetary units having a plurality 

of denominations, the method comprising: 

(i) determining a desired total for a 
combination of monetary units to be dispensed; 
(ii) determining one combination of monetary
