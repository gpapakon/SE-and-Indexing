<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, faulty isolated bits in the cache memory are 
made inaccessible to the microprocessor by rendering an appropriate line of data in the 

cache memory uncacheable to the microprocessor. When faulty data bits are not 
repairable through conventional repair means such as row/column redundancy, the tag 

RAM may be programmed with the address of the faulty data bit such that when the 
microprocessor requests data at that address, a comparator inside the tag RAM 

generates a signal indicative of a "miss" condition which is an output signal of the tag 
RAM. The miss condition is communicated to the microprocessor which must access the 

requested data from main memory. In this way, a cache memory having faulty data bits 
may still be utilized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit memory devices, and
more specifically to a structure for utilizing a cache memory having faulty bits.During the manufacture of integrated circuit memory devices, die are often
discarded because certain bits of the die are defective and not easily identified and
repaired at, for instance, laser repair. Even though a majority of the die may be fully
functional, it is often necessary to discard the entire die as scrap if the unfunctional bits
of the die are not identifiable. This problem is exacerbated when a memory device is
embedded in another, more expensive device such as a microprocessor or an application
specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It is undesirable to discard a costly microprocessor, for
instance, just because the memory embedded in it has isolated, faulty bits. This concern
for recovering the use of an integrated circuit memory die extends to technologies such
as cache memories, memory cards, and memories embedded in ASICs. Cache memories are increasingly used as primary caches embedded in high
performance microprocessors or as secondary caches external to the microprocessor.
As computer microprocessors have become faster and faster, the rate at which requested
data must be supplied increases as well. Such memories are often used to quickly
supply data requested by a microprocessor. Cache memories are an element of the
typical cache system which has five elements: the microprocessor, main memory, the tag
RAM, the cache memory, and control logic. The cache memory can be embedded in the
microprocessor, in which case it is a "primary cache", or it may be a discrete component,
external to the microprocessor, in which case it is called a "secondary cache". The tag
RAM holds the address locations of all data which is stored in the data cache. The tag
may be associated with a "line" of data in the cache memory, where the line is a block
of data which can be one or several consecutive bytes or words of data. When the
microprocessor requests information, a read signal is immediately sent to both the main
memory and the tag RAM. The tag RAM compares the requested memory address with
the memory address of all data stored in the cache memory. If the requested memory
address is in the tag RAM, a "hit" condition exists, and data from that location will be
gated from the cache memory to the microprocessor.In a "hit" condition, the tag RAM generates a valid compare Match output signal.
In the hit condition, the cache memory gates the required
