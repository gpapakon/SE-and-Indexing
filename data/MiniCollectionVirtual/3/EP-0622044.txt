<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vacuum cleaner body comprising two compartments (2, 3) separated by a dividing wall (4) comprising a hole (5) for the passage of air, namely a first compartment (2) containing a dustbag, and a second compartment containing a vacuum unit (6), a cable self-winder (7), and various control modules. According to the invention, the second compartment (3) contains a box (8) housing the vacuum unit (6) and on which is additionally mounted the cable self-winder (7) and the various control modules, said box (8) being fastened to said second compartment by attachment means.

<CLAIMS>
Vacuum cleaner housing having two compartments (2, 3) 

separated by a partition (4) including an air discharge 
orifice (5), that is to say a first compartment (2) receiving 

a dust bag, and a second compartment (3) containing a casing 
(8) which encloses a suction unit (6) and which is fixed to 

the second compartment (3) by attachment means (18, 19, 19', 
20, 21), an automatic cable reel (7) and various control 

modules (13, 14, 15), characterised in that the automatic 
cable reel (7) and the various control modules (13, 14, 15) 

are mounted on the casing (8). 
Vacuum cleaner housing according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the casing (8) has two shells (9, 10) which are 

connected to each other by locking means and one of which (9), 
containing the motor (16) of the suction unit (6), carries the 

various modules and the automatic reel (7). 
Vacuum cleaner housing according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the various control modules consist of 

electronic control modules comprising a first module (13) for 
varying the speed of the suction unit, a second module (14) 

for starting and stopping the suction unit and a third module 
(15) for electrical distribution to the electrical accessories 

of the vacuum cleaner. 
Vacuum cleaner housing according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the housing (8) receiving the motor (16) has 

electrical connections of the automatic type connecting the 
electrical components (17) of the motor (16) to some of the 

various control modules. 
Vacuum cleaner housing according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the attachment means 

consist on the one hand of screws (19, 19') which pass through  
 

holes (20, 21) formed at the periphery of the casing (8) and 
enter protrusions arranged on the bottom of the second 

compartment (3) and on the other hand a collar (18) positioned 
on the shell (10) and fixed by screws (22, 23) which enter 

other protrusions arranged in the bottom of the second 
compartment (3). 
Vacuum cleaner housing according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the casing is produced 

from a composite plastic of the noise-reduction type.
