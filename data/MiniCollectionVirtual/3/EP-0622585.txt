<ABSTRACT>
A switch or button assembly (10) having a graphic 
image of a first colour and which, when back-lit, 

provides a graphic image of a different colour comprises:
 

   a transparent formed cap member (30) having a predetermined 
shape, a first exterior surface (34) and a 

second interior surface (36), the second interior surface 
(36) being provided with opaque means (22) having a predetermined 

clear portion (44) forming the graphic image;
 

   first translucent colour means (46) on the second side 
of the cap (12) at least covering the clear graphic image 

portion;
 

   second translucent colour means (48) on the second 
side of the cap (12) at least covering said first colour 

means (46); and
 

   transparent button support means (16) connected to the 
cap (30) for providing support to the cap (30) and for cooperation 

with the second side (36) of the cap (30) behind 
the first (46) and second (48) colour means. With this 

arrangement, when viewed from the first side of the cap 
(30), the button assembly (10) includes a graphic image 

having a colour corresponding to that of the first colour 
means (48) and when back-lit from the second side of the 

cap the graphic image has a different colour. The 
invention can also be applied to any back-lit image 

display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to back-lit 
image displays, and more particularly to a switch or 
button assembly including a formed cap of any simple or 
complex shape where the cap includes a graphic image formed 
therewith having a first colour visible in day time or 
direct light and one or more different colours when 
back-lit. Back-lit buttons typically are utilized on control 
panels and dashboards of automobiles and provide a graphic 
on a substantially planar exterior face of the button which 
identifies the function of the button, such as a "door 
lock" button or the like. These buttons usually are formed 
from plastic and are provided with a dark major opaque 
colour, such as black, and a clear window therethrough 
having a graphic thereon of a contrasting colour, such as 
white or grey, which is translucent and referred to as a 
"day time colour". When the graphic is back-lit with a 
light source of a different "night time colour," such as 
green, blue, red or orange, the night time colour radiates 
through the day time colour and the graphic is seen by a 
user having the night time colour. An example of such a back-lit button is provided by 
what is known in the art as the "Paint and Laser Method" an 
example of which is illustrated in FIG. 18. As described 
in detail below, this method typically includes applying a 
white translucent layer of material, which provides the day 
time colour, over a colour tinted translucent plastic 
button, which provides the night time colour. An opaque 
black layer of material then is applied over the white 
layer and a laser is directed against the black layer to 
etch a desired graphic through the black layer only, 
exposing the white layer underneath. Thus, the graphic is 
provided in white for day time viewing and, when the tinted 
plastic button is back-lit from an external light source,  
 
the colour of the tinted plastic can be seen through the 
white translucent layer for night time viewing. The graphics on these buttons, however, are on the 
front exterior or "first surface" of the button which faces 
outward from the control panel and is repeatedly contacted 
by a user. Thus, they readily are susceptible to wear and 
image erosion as well as residue accumulation over and 
within the recesses forming the image which serves to 
render the image unreadable. Additionally, since the 
tinted plastic button provides the night time colour, it is 
difficult to provide more than one night time colour per 
button. Back-lit buttons also are known

<CLAIMS>
A button assembly (10) having a graphic image of a 
first colour and which, when back-lit, provides a graphic 

image of a different colour comprising: 
   a transparent formed cap member (30) having a predetermined 

shape, a first exterior surface (34) and a 
second interior surface (36), said second interior surface 

(36) being provided with opaque means (22) having a predetermined 
clear portion (44) forming a graphic image; 

   first translucent colour means (46) on said second 
side of said cap (12) at least covering said clear graphic 

image portion; 
   second translucent colour means (48) on said second 

side of said cap (12) at least covering said first colour 
means (46); and 

   transparent button support means (16) connected to 
said cap (30) for providing support to said cap (30) and 

for co-operation with said second side (36) of said cap 
(30) behind said first (46) and second (48) colour means so 

that when viewed from the first side of said cap (30), 
said button assembly (10) includes a graphic image having 

a colour corresponding to that of said first colour means 
(48) and when back-lit from said second side of said cap 

said graphic image has a different colour. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein said clear 
portion of said opaque means (22) is ablated away using a 

laser beam directed through said transparent cap member 
(30). 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
first and second colour means are separate colour foil 

means (46, 48) or are contained on a single colour foil 
means. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said formed cap member (30) is of a

image and emanating from a first side of the assembly in a 
pre-determined pattern, comprising: 

   a sheet member having a first front side and a second 
opposite rear side; 

   a translucent graphic image on said second side of

   light directing film means covering said graphic image 
for directing light emanating from said first side of said 

sheet member in a pre-determined pattern. 
An assembly as defined in claim 5, wherein said sheet 
member is transparent and said translucent graphic image is 

a laser formed image provided by coating said second side 
of said sheet member with an opaque coating and removing 

desired portions of said coating with a laser or is a 
screen printed image formed on said second side of said 

sheet member. 
An assembly as defined in claim 5 or 6, wherein said 
film means are positioned on said first side of said sheet 

member or on said second side of said sheet member. 
An assembly as defined in any one of claims 5, 6 or 7,

sheet member. 
An assembly as defined in claim 8, wherein said first 
daytime translucent colour means are gold or silver. 
An assembly as defined in claim 8, wherein said first 
daytime translucent colour means are a first foil member. 
An assembly as defined in claim 10, wherein said foil 
member is a metallic foil of sufficient thickness to 

provide the desired daytime colour yet prevent light 
scattering when back-lit. 
An assembly as defined in claim 8, 9, 10 or 11 
including a second night time translucent colour means 

covering said first colour means, said second colour means 
 

being visible from the first side of said sheet member when 
back-lit.

second colour means are a second foil member or are a 

tinted support member connected to said second side of said 
sheet member or are a clear support member connected to 

said second side of said sheet member and a tinted bulb for 
back lighting said assembly. 
An assembly as defined in claim 7 or any claim 
dependent upon claim 7, including a first foil member 

positioned between said second side of said sheet member 
and said film means to provide a first daytime translucent 

colour to said graphic image and a second foil member 
positioned on the opposite side of said film means to
