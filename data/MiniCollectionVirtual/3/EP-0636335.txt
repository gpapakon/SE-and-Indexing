<ABSTRACT>
A yolk cup (17) is provided for use in an egg breaking 
apparatus. The yolk cup (17) is pivotable between a 

substantially horizontal position and an inclined position. In 
the horizontal position, the yolk cup (17) receives an egg 

content including a yolk and an albumen, the yolk cup (17) 
being provided with a discharge cutout (29) for selectively 

discharging the albumen while retaining the yolk when the yolk 
cup (17) is held in the horizontal position. The discharge 

cutout (29) comprises an upper yolk discharge portion (29a) 
extending up to an upper brim of the yolk cup (17) for 

discharging the yolk when the yolk cup (17) is pivoted to the 
inclined position, and a pair of lower albumen discharge 

portions (29b) continuous with the yolk discharge portion (29a) 
at both sides thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a yolk cup which can be
advantageously incorporated in an automatic egg breaking
apparatus. More specifically, the present invention relates to
a yolk cup of the type which receives the content of an
automatically broken egg and separately discharges the yolk and
albumen of the egg content.As is well known, eggs have found wide use. For
example, the egg yolk may be used as a material for making
mayonnaise or other food products. The egg white (albumen) may
be used for making pharmaceutical products or as a binder for
protein products. Due to such wide use of the egg, it is
absolutely necessary in industry to use an automatic egg
breaking apparatus for breaking eggs and taking out their
contents at high speed. Further, since the two different parts
of the egg content have different applications, it is also
necessary to automatically separate the yolk and albumen.U.S. Patent No. 4,111,111 to Willsey discloses a cup
assembly used in an automatic egg breaker for separating the
content of an automatically broken egg. More specifically, the
cup assembly comprises an upper yolk cup (separating cup) and a
lower albumen cup. The yolk cup has a V-shaped groove at a
front portion of the yolk cup, and a separate slot at a rear
portion of the yolk cup. When the yolk cup receives the egg
content, the egg albumen is discharged gravitionally through
the V-shaped groove and through the slot for falling into the
lower albumen cup while retaining the egg yolk. Further, the 
yolk cup is pivotable to assume a laterally inclined
position for discharging the egg yolk over the top
brim of the yolk cup.According to the prior art arrangement described
above, the V-shaped groove is used only for
selectively discharging the egg albumen, and the egg
yolk is discharged over the top brim of the yolk cup
by laterally pivoting the yolk cup. Thus, it is
necessary to later pivot the albumen cup forwardly
downward for discharging the albumen from the albumen
cup. In other words, the egg yolk and the egg albumen
must be discharged from the respective cups by two
different pivotal movements with a time difference.
As a result, the efficiency of the automatic egg
breaker as a whole becomes relatively low.It is conceivable to use the V-shaped
groove also for discharging the egg yolk by pivoting
the yolk cup forwardly downward without prior lateral
pivoting. In this case, however, the yolk sac is
likely to be damaged by coming into rubbing contact
with the edges of the V-shaped groove.It is, therefore, an object of

A yolk cup (17) for an egg breaking apparatus,
the yolk cup (17) being pivotable between a

substantially horizontal position and an inclined
position, the yolk cup (17) in the horizontal position

receiving an egg content including a yolk (Y) and an
albumen (W), the yolk cup (17) being provided with a

discharge cutout (29) for selectively discharging the
albumen (W) while retaining the yolk (Y) when the yolk

cup (17) is held in the horizontal position, the
discharge cutout (29) comprising an upper yolk

discharge portion (29a) extending up to an upper brim
of the yolk cup (17) for discharging the yolk (Y) when

the yolk cup (17) is pivoted to the inclined position,

and a lower albumen discharge means (29b) continuous
with the yolk discharge portion (29a), characterised

in that the albumen discharge means of the discharge
cutout (29) comprises a pair of lower albumen

discharge portions (29b) continuous with the yolk
discharge portion (29a), located at both sides of the

yolk discharge portion (29a) and separated from each
other by an upwardly convex arcuate bottom edge (30a)

of the discharge cutout (29).
The yolk cup according to claim 1, wherein the
albumen discharge portions (29b) of the discharge

cutout (29) extend obliquely downwardly away from each
other.
The yolk cup according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
the yolk discharge portion (29a) of the discharge

cutout (29) is generally rectangular. 
The yolk cup according to any one of claims 1 to
3, wherein the upper brim (25) of the yolk cup (17) is

substantially circular, the yolk discharge portion
(29a) of the discharge cutout (29) having a minimum

width which is 1/4 to 1/2 of the diameter of the upper
brim (25).
The yolk cup according to any one of claims 1 to
4, wherein each of the respective albumen discharge

portions (29b) of the discharge cutout (29) is
partially defined by a downwardly convex arcuate end

edge (30b).
The yolk cup according to any one of claims 1 to
5, wherein the yolk discharge portion (29a) of the

discharge cutout (29) is partially defined by a pair
