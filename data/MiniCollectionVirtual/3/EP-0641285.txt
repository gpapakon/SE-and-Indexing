<ABSTRACT>
An identification element, e.g. a photo ID card, consisting of a plurality of laminated layers or a material encloses two transparent cover sheets which enclose at least one printed data carrier. The data carrier (1) consists of a substantially transparent print sheet on which data can be printed in one printing operation, and includes two print reproduction areas (A, B) separated from each other by a zone (2) in which the material is thinner, said areas being superposed in that the print sheet is folded along the thinner zone (2) after the printing operation has terminated, and forming the readable front and rear sides of the identification element with at least one substantially non-transparent contrasting intermediate layer (4) being enclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Identification element, in particular a photo ID cardThe invention relates to an indentification element, in particular a photo ID card, which consists of a plurality of layers of a material adapted to be laminated.Identification elements of the aforementioned type consist as a rule of a data carrier which is enclosed by two transparent cover sheets, comprises, in the most simple case, a blank form to which a photograph and hand or machine-written information can be added, and is subsequently sealed between the cover sheets under the action of heat and pressure. The ID card is then finished in that it is cut to size by means of a puncher which removes irregularities at the edges.When methods are used which are more up-to-date, the data carrier is produced by means of a user software, the photograph being taken with a color video camera and the personal data as well as other details and graphic components being digitized and printed, e. g. with a thermal printer. The data carrier can be sealed such that an inlay provided with an adhesive layer and having an indentation or recess corresponding to the dimensions and the thickness of the data carrier is placed between the cover sheets. The data carrier is then inserted accordingly and the whole arrangement is then subjected to the heat and pressure treatment of a so-called laminator and cut to size.These two methods which are relatively time-consuming are disadvantageous in that identification elements produced in this manner have a relatively limited lifetime as the laminate, when used improperly or with the intention to tamper with the data carrier, breaks down into its components or is taken to pieces or is at least unsightly at the edges or prevents the card from being inserted into a card reader if said card is intended for such use. 

It is the object of the invention to avoid such disadvantages and to create an identification element which is extremely durable and resistant to counterfeiting.This object is attained in that the data carrier consists of a substantially transparent print sheet on which data can be printed in one printing operation, and includes two print reproduction areas separated from each other by a zone in which the material is thinner, said areas being superposed in that the print sheet is folded along the thinner zone after the printing operation has terminated, and forming the readable front and rear sides of the identification element with at least one substantially non-transparent contrasting intermediate layer being

 Patent Claims
1. Identification element, in particular a photo ID card, which consists of a plurality of laminated layers of a material and encloses two transparent cover sheets which enclose at least one printed data carrier, characterized in that the data carrier (1) consists of a substantially transparent print sheet on which data can be printed in one printing operation, and includes two print reproduction areas (A, B) separated from each other by a zone (2) in which the material is thinner, said areas being superposed in that the print sheet is folded along the thinner zone (2) after the printing operation has terminated, and forming the readable front and rear sides of the identification element with at least one substantially non-transparent contrasting intermediate layer (4) being enclosed.
2. Identification element according to claim 1, characterized in that the zone (2) in which the material is thinner extends in the middle of the data carrier (1).
3. Identification element according to claim l, characterized in that the zone (2) in which the material is thinner extends excentrically across the data carrier
(1).
4. Identification element according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the zone (2) in which the material is thinner is formed by an optionally designed line of perforation holes.
5. Identification element according to claim 1, characterized in that the data carrier (1) consists of a polyester material. 


6. Identification element according to one or several of the preceding claims, characterized in that said element includes, in addition to the print, at least one non-visual data storage means such as a magnetic strip, a card chip, elements acting inductively and/or capacitively, or the like.
