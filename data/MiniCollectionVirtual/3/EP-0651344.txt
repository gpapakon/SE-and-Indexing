<ABSTRACT>
The identification system, has a transceiver (1), providing an interrogation signal, converted into an acoustic surface wave upon reception by the identification tag, incorporating at least one spread spectrum reflector (10). The transmission and/or reception circuit (2,3) of the transceiver has a stage (12) with a complementary characteristic to the spread spectrum reflector. Pref. a dispersive, a phase-shift-keying, or a min. phase-shift-keying spread spectrum reflector is used. The transceiver is pref. operated in an initial mode for providing an interrogation signal matched to the reflector characteristic and in a second mode for reading data from the identification tag.

<CLAIMS>
Identification system having a transceiver (1)
and having identification tags (6 - SAW-ID tags), which

can be interrogated by the said transceiver and work
with surface acoustic waves, 
characterized in that
 at
least one reflector (10) of the ID tags (6) is designed

as a spread spectrum reflector and the transceiver (1)
contains, in its transmitting and/or receiving part (2,

3), a stage (12) having a characteristic which is
complementary to the characteristic of the spread

spectrum reflector (10).
Identification system according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the reflector (10) is a
dispersive reflector.
Identification system according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the reflector (10) is a phase
shift keying reflector.
Identification system according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the reflector (10) is a minimum
shift keying reflector.
Identification system according to one of
Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the transceiver
(1) can be operated in two operating states, in such a

way that, in a first operating state, it transmits an
interrogation signal with a characteristic matched to

the spread spectrum reflector (10) and, depending on
the reception of a response signal from the spread

spectrum reflector (10), changes over to a second 
operating state for reading data from the associated ID

tag (6).
