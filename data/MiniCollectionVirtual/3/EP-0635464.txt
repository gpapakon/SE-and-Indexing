<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chemical component for
pavement and wall tile ceramics manufactured through mono
or bi-cooking processes.Ceramic tile manufacture has several steps as
follows:Mixture and homogenization of several kinds of raw
materials (see standard composition described below). The
main objective in this step is reducing the size of solid
particles in order to increase the surface.Clay, water, and chemical additives are charged
to the ball mill. After a milling time from 2 h. to 8 h.,
preferably 3 - 4 h., a slurry is obtained with a range of
clay content from 62% to 72%, generally from 65% to 66%.
The slurry has to be fluid. So, its viscosity should be
lower than 2000 cps, preferably lower than 1000 cps. The
function of chemical additives added previously is
reaching the correct viscosity level of the slurry. These
additives present a high dispersion ability, generally are
inorganic compounds like sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium
metasilicate, etc.After milling, the slurry is discharged into a
vessel with mechanical agitation, that avoid particle
sedimentation and maintain the homogeneity of the slurry.From the vessel, the slurry passes through a sieve
and it is pumped to the atomizer, where is pulverized. It
dries upon contacting hot air with a temperature between
500°C and 600°C. A powder product is obtained with a 
moisture level, from 4% to 7% content of water, and an
average particle size, from 150µ to 600µ. This level of
moisture is necessary in order to avoid problems in the
press moulding step. The particle size has a direct
relationship with the compactation and the mechanical
resistence of the green and cooked tiles.Pressing is the simultaneous compaction and
shaping of a powder product confined within a rigid die.
The standard process uses an hidraulic press. The pressure
range goes from 150 kg/cm2 to 300 kg/cm2, preferably 210
- 270 kg/cm2. The green body is obtained at the end of
this step. Then it is dried during a fast drying process,
where liquid is removed from pores of the green body. At
this time, the faces of the tile are in contact with hot
air (120°C - 200°C) during a short period of time (35 -
55 min.). As a consequence of the drying process the level
of moisture of the ceramic tile is lower than 1.5%.During this step decorative coatings are applied
on the surface of the green ceramic tiles. The green body
(dried) goes through several devices where upper surface
is enameled and serigraphied. After ward the ceramic tiles
are stored in an appropriate place before the
