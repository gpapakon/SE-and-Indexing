<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus and a method for extrusion of profiles of material suitable for extrusion, such as metal or plastic. In the method of the invention, the temperature of the extruding product (10) is measured continuously and without contact immediately outside the extrusion outlet (7), and the data measured are used to adjust the said temperature to the effect that the temperature of the extruding product is maintained as constant as possible from one proudct to the next, whereby controlling devices (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22) are provided to adjust the extrusion pressure on the basis of a calculation of the values measured and to check the quality of the profile and the geometric dimension for comparison with the predetermined values. The apparatus comprises an extrusion machine (1) having a measuring device for measuring the temperature at the outside of the outlet (7) continuously and without contact, said device (11) being a camera (11) responsive to infrared radiation, as is the case with a device (16) for measuring the temperature of the workpiece (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of extruding
profiles of material, such as bodies of metal or plastics.The present invention also relates to an apparatus for
working the method according to the invention.In the extrusion of profiles of metal or plastics malformations
or irregularities in the structure of the extruded
product occasionally occur during the extrusion
operation, in particular in profiles which have been subjected
to different temperatures in the different areas
of the profiler and such malformations and irregularities
of the material structure will result in an unsatisfactory
quality of the end product.Generally, such malformations and irregularities are the
result of varying temperatures of the extrudate during
the extrusion operation caused by the forces which are
applied onto the material with the purpose of driving it
through the extrusion die.To counter these malformations and irregularities attempts
have been made to improve the extrusion process in
various ways.GB-A-1,431,884 describes a method
of the kind where the temperature is measured by direct
contact at the foremost portion of the extrudate near the
die in order to form an estimate of the extrusion temperature.
At the same time the thermal radiation of the
extrudate is measured without contact by means of a heat-sensitive
instrument in order to determine a thermal radiation
temperature which is subsequently corrected on 
the basis of the estimate of the extrusion temperature.
During the extrusion operation determination of a corrected
thermal radiation temperature continues without
contact and the speed of extrusion is reduced if the
thermal radiation temperature rises above a predetermined
optimum temperature and, conversely, the speed of extrusion
is increased if the thermal radiation temperature
falls below the predetermined optimum temperature.The above method, however, has some drawbacks. Thus,
measuring the temperature of the extrudate by direct contact
in order to obtain a correction of the thermal radiation
temperature is a difficult procedure, and in addition,
the method is complex and time-consuming so that
a production rate which can be considered satisfactory as
compared to the expected performance of modern extrusion
apparatuses cannot be obtained.The above identified patent specification also provides
an apparatus for use in the extrusion of profiles which
apparatus is of the type comprising a machine having an
extrusion die and means for driving material suitable for
extrusion, such as a body of metal
