<ABSTRACT>
An orthodontic bracket (120), such as a bracket made of 
ceramic material, is provided with a liner (126) that 

enhances sliding mechanics between the bracket and an 
archwire. A portion of the liner projects beyond the 

bracket body (122) and optionally includes an occlusal, 
gingival or lingual section (148, 150) that extends over a mesial 

or distal side (134, 135) of the bracket body. A bottom surface 
of the liner (126) is located a distance from a bottom wall 

of a channel receiving the liner, and the distance 
optionally varies along the length of the archwire 

slot in order to urge the attached tooth to rotate as 
needed about its long axis. The liner is bonded to 

the bracket body in such a manner that the bracket 
body is thereafter held by the liner in compression.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bracket that is used
in orthodontic therapy and has an archwire slot liner
for enhancing sliding movement of the bracket along an
archwire coupled to the bracket.In orthodontic treatment, tiny devices known as
brackets are secured to the patient's teeth. An
archwire is received in a slot of each bracket, and is
held in place in the slots by ligating wires or by
small elastic O-rings that extend around each bracket
and the archwire. The teeth connected to the brackets
are urged toward orthodontically correct positions by
bends or twists placed in the archwire, or by
elastomeric modules interconnecting certain brackets.
The archwire serves as a track to guide sliding
movement of the brackets so that the associated teeth
are shifted toward desired positions.In the past, orthodontic brackets were often made
of stainless steel, and archwires were made of
stainless steel or alloys containing stainless steel,
nickel and titanium. In general, frictional
resistance to sliding movement of the metal brackets,
while not insignificant, is a factor that is not
considered unsatisfactory by most orthodontists.
However, metal brackets are not aesthetic and are
sometimes referred to as a "tin grin" that may be an
embarrassment to the patient. Orthodontic brackets made of non-opaque plastic
materials such as polycarbonate have been introduced
by various manufacturers over the years.
Unfortunately, some plastic brackets exhibit undue
deformation of the archwire slots because of creep of
the material as orthodontic forces are applied by the
wire to the brackets. Undue deformation of the
archwire slots may prevent precise control of movement
of the associated teeth, and in some instances may
cause the brackets to fracture. Replacement of
brackets during orthodontic treatment is time
consuming and is often considered a nuisance by the
orthodontist as well as by the patient.It has been proposed in the past to provide
metallic archwire slot liners for plastic brackets, in
part as an attempt to avoid deformation of the plastic
material. Examples of archwire slot liners are
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,964,165, 4,299,569 and
4,302,532. Metallic archwire slot liners for plastic
brackets provide sliding mechanics that resemble the
sliding mechanics as would be observed when an all-metal
bracket is used.Orthodontic brackets have also been made of
translucent ceramic material such as polycrystalline
aluminum oxide as is described in U.S. Patent No.
