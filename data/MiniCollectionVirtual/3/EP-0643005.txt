<ABSTRACT>
A sewing machine is provided for splicing together two 
different threads. The machine includes a thread tree (26) with 

a number of thread spools with each thread thereof being 
inserted through flexible plastic tubing (32). A movable 

carriage assembly (34) locates the new thread to be spliced 
relative to a splicing device passageway (132) that receives the 

new thread to be spliced along with the old thread. The 
splicing device (130) includes a front air inlet (140) for drawing the 

new thread into the passageway of the splicing device (130) and 
a rear air inlet (136) for creating air turbulence during the 

splicing operation. Also used in moving the new thread 
through the passageway is an insertion drive roller (40) 

connected to a pivotal rocker (38). A thread clamp cover (122) 
connected to the rocker (38) cooperates with the trimmer blades (116) 

to trim the old thread. A thread clamp (126) and a thread clamp 
magnet (128) cooperate to hold the old thread in a desired 

position during the insertion of the new thread into the 
splicing device (130). A tensioning assembly is able to adjust 

new thread tension based on a desired tension for the new 
thread.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sewing machines and, 
in particular, to a stitching apparatus and method for 
splicing threads. In connection with the sewing of designs and other 
patterns on work pieces such as garments or cloth, it is 
often desired to use threads of various types and colors in 
the sewing or embroidery of a given design. When a sewing 
or embroidery machine is used, the thread used may be 
changed by manually removing a thread and rethreading the 
machine with another thread. Another method of providing 
for numerous threads is to employ a machine which uses a 
number of needles and associated mechanisms, each of which 
is threaded with a different thread. In such a system, 
availability of a large number of threads requires a 
complex machine having separate needle assemblies for each 
type of thread in use. As the desired number of threads 
increases, the complexity and cost of the machine 
necessarily increases. In machines having a single needle, threads may be 
changed by splicing the first thread to a second thread in 
a manner which enables the splice to be drawn through the 
eye of the needle, effectively threading the needle with 
the second thread. It is known that a splice may be formed 
by placing the two threads to be spliced in close proximity  
 
to each other and subjecting the threads to a jet of air at 
relatively high velocity. The jet of air causes a portion 
of the fibers of the threads to interlace along a region of 
both threads. The interlacing of the fibers is intended to 
form a splice of sufficient strength and desired size such 
that the spliced portion can readily pass through the eye 
of the needle. Although it is known to use an air jet to splice two 
threads, it would be advantageous to provide a sewing 
machine with an integrated thread changing capability for 
effectively and efficiently handling all weights and types 
of threads. Such a capability should be provided in a cost 
effective manner of both construction and operation. It 
would also be desirable to provide such a machine with the 
capability of selecting from a large number of thread types 
and colors by providing an efficient mechanism for the 
supply of such threads. Such a machine having thread 
changing capability would also desirably include the 
feature of being able to adjust the tension of the threads 
for most effective sewing. It would also be advantageous 
to expeditiously and efficiently select new threads and to 
execute a thread change which wastes the minimum amount of 
thr

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for splicing a first thread with a 
second thread, comprising: 

   a thread tree having a number of spools with each 
having a thread and including at least a first spool having 

a first thread and a second spool having a second thread; 
   a thread clamp assembly for releasably holding at 

least one of the first thread and the second thread; 
   a splicing device for splicing the first and second 

threads together; 
   a carriage assembly for locating a second thread 

selected from the number of threads in a desired position 
relative to said splicing device; 

   means for moving at least one of the first and second
