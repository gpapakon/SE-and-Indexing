<ABSTRACT>
A leakage dielectric waveguide includes a housing 
made of plane-shaped parallel electrical conductors (1,2) 

provided so as to be parallel to each other, and a 
dielectric strip (3) for propagating a high-frequency wave 

between the parallel electrical conductors (1,2), wherein the 
dielectric strip (3) is provided within the housing. The 

housing is arranged to be asymmetrical (2
s
), thereby leaking and 
radiating a high-frequency wave propagating through the 

dielectric strip (3). Further, the housing is preferably 
further composed of the plane-shaped parallel electrical 

conductors (1,2) and a side wall (4). Further, a plane antenna (10) can 
be constituted by the above-mentioned leakage dielectric 

waveguide, and projecting means, in response to the high-frequency 
wave projected from the dielectric waveguide, for 

projecting the high-frequency wave toward free space.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a leakage dielectric waveguide according to the
preamble of claim 1 and a plane antenna using the leakage dielectric waveguide,
and particularly to a leakage dielectric waveguide for leaking and radiating a
high-frequency wave and a plane antenna using the leakage dielectric waveguide.
In the specification, the term ,,high-frequency waves" means microwaves, quasi-millimeter
waves, or millimeter waves which have a frequency higher than
approximately 1 GHz. A leakage dielectricwaveguide according to the preamble of
claim 1 is shown in ,,Electronics and Communications in Japan, part II:
Electronics", .No. 2,. Feb. 1991, NY, US; Yoneyama: ,,Millimeter-Wave
Integrated Circuits Using Nonradiative Dielectric Waveguide".As a dielectric waveguide for millimeter wave integrated circuits, there has been
conventionally known to those skilled in the art, a nonradiative dielectric
waveguide (hereinafter, referred to as an NRD waveguide), in which a dielectric
strip is sandwiched between upper and lower metal plates. The conventional
NRD waveguide is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Examined
Publication No. 1-51202. In the NRD waveguide, there has been proposed a
leakage NRD waveguide (hereinhafter, referred to as a conventional leakage
NRD waveguide), in 
which the dielectric strip is provided with a plurality of
recessed portions at intervals of a propagation wavelength
of electromagnetic waves Î»g. In this case, when a
millimeter wave signal is applied to an end of the NRD
waveguide for excitation, and then the millimeter wave
signal is leaked between the upper and lower metal plates
so that radiation is accomplished. The conventional NRD
waveguide is disclosed in, for example, Tsukasa Yoneyama et
al., "Leakage Wave NRD waveguide of Broadside Radiation",
the Proceedings of Spring Meeting of the Institute of the
Electronics, Information, and Communications Engineers, in
Japan, as published on March 15, 1992.Further, there is also proposed a plane antenna,
in which the conventional leakage NRD waveguide and a slot
antenna are combined together with each other. This is
disclosed in, for example, Toshihiko Agatsuma et al.,
"Preliminary Experiments on Plane Antenna with Transmission
Lines of Leakage Wave NRD waveguides", the Proceedings of
Spring Meeting of the Institute of the Electronics,
Information, and Communications Engineers, in Japan, as
published on March 15, 1992.However, in order to provide the recessed
portions in the dielectric strip, it is necessary to
perform an
