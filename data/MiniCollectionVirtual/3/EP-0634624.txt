<ABSTRACT>
Tool for measuring a clamping force exerted by a movable rod (4) of a length-measurement device. It comprises a casing (16), at the bottom of which a force sensor (17) has been housed and the edge of which is placed on a surface of the apparatus body. The movable rod (4) exerts on the sensor (17) a force which is indicated by a display (18) connected to the sensor (17). The invention relates to the checking of micrometers.

<CLAIMS>
A tool (15, 34, 47) for measuring a clamping force
applied by a movable rod (4) extending from a body (2) of a

linear measurement device (1) between a free end of the rod
(4) and a free end of an end stop (3) secured to the body (2),

the device comprising a member (5) for moving the rod (4) by
way of a torque limiter, the tool (15, 34, 47) being composed

of a casing (16, 38, 48), a force sensor (17) and read-out
means (18), characterised in that the casing (16, 38, 48) is

in the form of an open enclosure and comprises an edge (29)
adapted to be placed on that surface (30) of the body (2)

which extends around the rod (4), in that the force sensor
(17) is disposed on an end member (19, 39, 48) of the casing

and in that the read-out means (18) is a means of displaying
the force experienced by the force sensor (17).
A tool according to claim 1, characterised in that the
sensor is in the form of a resilient diaphragm (21) to which

strain gauges (22) are stuck.
A tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the casing comprises a circular wall (20, 40) which extends

around the sensor (17) and rises from the end member (19, 39).
A tool according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the circular wall is composed of a socket (24, 40)

rigidly secured to the end member (19, 39) and of a sleeve
(26, 41) which is screwed to the socket (24, 40) and retains

the sensor (17).
A tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the casing comprises a plane wall (49) behind which the sensor 

(17) is disposed and which is formed with a recess (52) to
leave the sensor (17) visible, a screw (51) being engaged in a

socket (50) which is rigidly secured to the plane wall (59)
and urging the sensor (17) towards the plane wall (49).
A tool According to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that
the casing is prolonged by a stack of separable rings (35).
A tool according to claim 6, characterised in that the
rings have ends having means (36, 37) for assembly with other

rings.
A tool according to claim 7, characterised in that the
assembly means consists of nesting means.
