<ABSTRACT>
An automated cashier system provides for microprocessor-controlled product display, order acceptance, payment and change generation. Both cash and credit card payments are accepted. The system is preferably mounted in a cabinet (10) having upper (16) and lower (28) sections. The upper section contains the input and output systems, while the lower section contains the cash receipt, storage and dispensation systems. The main microprocessor is also located in the lower section, which is preferably in the form of a safe (30) which prevents access to the critical systems of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new and improved apparatus
adapted to automate the functions presently performed by personnel
in a variety of retail environments, such as supermarkets, fast
food chains and the like, by providing a unified apparatus for the
display of available goods or services; the acceptance of order
information with respect thereto; the acceptance and confirmation
of payment in a variety of forms and the generation of change, if
required; production of a receipt, and the transmission of order
information to a related facility as required for order
fulfillment. In addition, ancillary features, such as accounting,
inventory control and the like are provided.It is well recognized and appreciated that there is a
shortage of personnel necessary to provide a full complement of
retail service employees. This shortage appears across the retail
spectrum, and is perhaps best exemplified by the personnel shortage
in the fast food industry. Because of the salary levels typically
in place, employers (and the public) are increasingly forced to
rely on a decreasing labor pool with the inability to obtain the
number and level of personnel which would otherwise be preferred.In addition to the shortage of personnel, the requirements,
particularly in the fast food industry, that an employee typically
take an order, accept payment and generate change, and collect and
deliver the order results in inefficiencies and errors. Further,
there always exists the risk of loss through pilferage, employee
theft, as well as hold-up, fraud and the like. These problems are
not limited to the fast food industry. Wherever employees are
required to process orders and payments there exists the potential
for error, theft, and product shrinkage.Many of these problems can be eliminated or at least minimized
by the utilization of automated equipment to augment or replace the
human factor. Towards this end, numerous approaches have been
taken to provide a variety of automated order entry systems in a
variety of environments. Representative of this prior art are
Patent Nos. 4,310,885; 4,530,067; 4,553,222; 4,582,172; 4,676,343
and 4,735,289. In general, above described patents are directed to various
facets of the automated cashier system, but do not disclose or
suggest a fully integrated system able to operate in a variety
of retail environments.In the US-Patent No. 3,647,026 (Alexander et al) an automated
cashier apparatus is disclosed comprising data entry means for
accepting purchase information from a customer and data
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An automated cashier apparatus comprising data entry means
for accepting purchase information from a customer (24,54)

and data display means for displaying sale related data to
the customer (56), means for credit card (20,82), coin and

currency acceptance (34), whereby the credit card acceptance
means comprise means for confirming the validity of

the credit card (82) and promt the user to provide alternative
payment if validity is denied (84) and means to confirm

the validity of said alternative payment whereby the
data entry and display means (24,54), credit card acceptance

means (20,82) and coin and currency acceptance (34)
and dispensation (254,304) means being interconnected, characterized

in that the automated cashier apparatus is comprising
a console (10) having first (16) and secon
d (28)
compartments herein, whereby the data entry means for accepting

purchase information from a customer (24,54) and
data display means for displaying sale related data to the

customer (56) are located in the first compartment (16) and
credit card purchase information (20,82) and coin and currency

acceptance (34) and dispensation means (254,304) are
located in the second compartment (28), which comprises a

tamper-resistant safe structure (30) and the data entry and
display means (24,52,54), credit card acceptance means

(20,82) and coin and currency acceptance (34) and dispensation
means (254,304) being logically interconnected are

controlled by microprocessor means comprising a primary
microprocessor located in said second compartment (28) and

a secondary microprocessor located in said first compartment
(16).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said data entry and display
means comprises a touch control video monitor (24,54).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said first microprocessor
includes memory means having stored value ranges for each 

of the items offered for sale (92), said second microprocessor
having memory means for storing pricing information

within the range stored in said first microprocessor means.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein said microprocessor
includes means to confirm that pricing information entered

upon said second microprocessor memory means is within the
ranges stored in said first microprocessor means.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said currency acceptances
means located in the second compartment comprises means for

determining the value of a currency bill (108), means for
confirming the authentity of the bill (108), and means for

storing the submitted bill (152).
The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said storage means
comprises a series of magazines (100,152) each dedicated to

storage of a given bill denomination (152).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said coin dispensation
means comprises a coin collection cup (230) adapted for

travel within said second (222) compartment from a first,
lowered position to a second, raised position and a customer-accessible

coin port (238) located proximate the raised
position of said collection cup (230), and means for transfer

of the contents from said cup to said port when said
cup is in the raised position (232).
