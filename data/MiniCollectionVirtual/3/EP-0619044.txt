<ABSTRACT>
A process for the treatment of material which is or is suspected to be contaminated with one or more actinides or compounds thereof, which process includes contacting the said material with a liquid medium which comprises an aqueous solution which is free of heavy metal ions (prior to use thereof) and comprises ingredients which are naturally degradable to non-toxic products with or without mild physical assistance such as heat or ultra-violet radiation, said solution comprising: (a) carbonated water; (b) a conditioning agent; and (c) a complexing agent which comprises the anion of a carboxylic acid having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms; wherein the said process is for treatment of solid organic wastes which are or are suspected to be contaminated with plutonium or compounds thereof with or without other hazardous contaminants and includes the steps of shredding the organic waste material, intimately mixing the shredded waste material with the said liquid medium thereby dissolving contaminants as complexes in said liquid medium and separating the said liquid medium from the shredded waste material thereby reducing the radioactivity level of the organic waste material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of 
solid organic wastes and particularly to processes 
suitable for the treatment of wastes which are or are 
suspected to be contaminated with plutonium or compounds 
thereof. Published GB 2229312A by the present applicants 
describes an aqueous medium comprising a solution which 
was designed for the purpose of dissolving, to enable 
separation of, actinides contained in so-called Magnox 
sludge resulting from the long-term storage underwater of 
irradiated nuclear fuel encased in containers made of 
Magnox, a magnesium alloy. The said solution herein referred to as "Solution X" 
is as follows: Solution X comprises an aqueous solution which is free 
of heavy metal ions (prior to use thereof) and comprises 
ingredients which are naturally degradable to non-toxic 
products with or without mild physical assistance such as 
heat or ultra-violet radiation, said solution comprising: 
(a) carbonated water;  (b) a conditioning agent which comprises an 
oxidising agent selected from hydrogen peroxide, 
ozone, oxygen-enriched air or potassium 
permanganate, or a reducing agent selected from 
hydrazine or hydroxylamine, 
and  (c) a complexing agent which comprises the anion 
of a carboxylic acid having from 2 to 6 carbon 
atoms.  We have discovered that Solution X unexpectedly and 
beneficially has other applications. The said Solution X 
may be used in the treatment of organic wastes as follows: According to the present invention there is provided a 
process for the treatment of material which is or is 
suspected to be contaminated with actinides or compounds 
thereof, which process includes contacting the said 
material with a liquid medium which comprises  
 
Solution X as defined hereinbefore, wherein the said 
process is for treatment of solid organic wastes which are 
or are suspected to be contaminated with plutonium or 
compounds thereof with or without other hazardous 
contaminants and includes the steps of shredding the 
organic waste material, intimately mixing the shredded 
waste material with the said liquid medium thereby 
dissolving contaminants as complexes in said liquid medium 
and separating the said liquid medium from the shredded 
waste material thereby reducing the radioactivity level of 
the organic waste material. The process according to the present invention 
provides a method of treating solid organic waste so that 
highly active plutonium contaminants contained in the 
waste are leached from the waste by dissolution in the 
said liquid

<CLAIMS>
A process for the treatment of material which is or is 
suspected to be contaminated with one or more actinides or 

compounds thereof, which process includes contacting the 
said material with a liquid medium which comprises an 

aqueous solution which is free of heavy metal ions (prior 
to use thereof) and comprises ingredients which are 

naturally degradable to non-toxic products with or without 
mild physical assistance such as heat or ultra-violet 

radiation, said solution comprising: 

(a) carbonated water; 
(b) a conditioning agent which comprises an 
oxidising agent selected from hydrogen peroxide,
 
   ozone, oxygen-enriched air and potassium 

permanganate, or a reducing agent selected from 
hydrazine or hydroxylamine,
 
and (c) a complexing agent which comprises the anion 

of a carboxylic acid having from 2 to 6 carbon 
atoms. 

wherein the said process is for treatment of solid organic 
wastes which are or are suspected to be contaminated with 

plutonium or compounds thereof with or without other 
hazardous contaminants and includes the steps of shredding 

the organic waste material, intimately mixing the shredded 
waste material with the said liquid medium thereby 

dissolving contaminants as complexes in said liquid medium 
and separating the said liquid medium from the shredded 

waste material thereby reducing the radioactivity level of 
the organic waste material. 
A process as in Claim 1 and wherein the waste treated 
by the process of the present invention comprises 

plutonium-contaminated materials obtained from a plant in 
which plutonium is handled as a material for use in or a 

product of a nuclear fission reaction. 
A process as in Claim 1 or Claim 2 and wherein the 
waste material treated by the process of the present  

 
invention also contains as contaminants one or more heavy 

metals. 
A process as in Claim 1, 2 or 3 and wherein the said 
process is one which is carried out at a temperature of 

less than 35°C and which gives no toxic or explosive off-gases. 
A process as in any one of the preceding Claims and 
wherein the said complexing agent is the anion of a 

carboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of 
citric acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid and EDTA 

(ethylenediamine tetracetic acid).

the said conditioning agent is present in the said 

solution in a concentration in the range from 0.01 Molar 
to 3 Molar. 
A process as in any one of the preceding Claims and 
wherein the said aqueous medium and the shredded organic 

waste material to be washed are mixed together by a 
stirring or churning action in a mixer to permit intimate 

contact between the solid pieces of the waste and the 
aqueous medium, the contaminants being washed into the 

solution comprising the aqueous medium which is separated 
from the solid waste by a separation process. 
A process as in any one of Claims 1 to 8 and wherein 
in the vessel employed for contacting the solid waste to 

be washed with the aqueous medium the waste is washed in 
successive discrete batches. 
A process as in any one of Claims 1 to 8 and wherein 
the waste is continuously fed into and extracted from the
