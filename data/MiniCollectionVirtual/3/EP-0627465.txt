<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new multilayer films
comprising, as a barrier layer, a blend of vinylidene
chloride copolymers suitable for use for packaging cheese.
The invention further relates to a package comprising the
film, and also to methods of producing the film.In the packaging of cheese and other foodstuffs,
shrink wrap film is frequently used to protect the
foodstuff from handling and decomposition during storage
and transport. Suitable films for packaging most sorts of
cheese require a compromise between permeability both to
oxygen and to carbon dioxide. It is firstly necessary to
have a low oxygen permeability in order to prevent contact
of the air with cheese which leads to the growth of mould
on the cheese and the oxidation of fat in the cheese which
would lead to a rancid taste. However, in the case of any
cheeses, a partial fermentation takes place after the
cheese is packaged and in such cases, it is necessary for
the film to be permeable, to at least a degree, to carbon
dioxide in order to prevent a build up of carbon dioxide
in the package. Similar considerations apply in relation
to other foodstuffs which release carbon dioxide after
being packaged, for example some processed meats. Films which are currently used to package
cheese comprise a barrier layer of vinylidene chloride-vinyl
chloride copolymer. This layer comprises in addition
plasticizer or stabiliser such as epoxidised soyabean oil
in order to modify the physical properties of the barrier
layer including permeability. The plasticizer or
stabiliser is added as a liquid and it may be necessary for
the liquid to form about 10% of the blend used to form the
barrier layer in order to obtain the desired permeability
properties for packaging cheese. For example IT-A-1168173
(Grace Italiana) discloses a film comprising a vinylidene
chloride copolymer barrier layer in which a plasticiser may
be used to control the permeability of the film. Typically
the barrier layer comprises from 6 to 10% by weight of
polymeric plasticiser.The use of a large amount of such a liquid
leads to difficulties in the production of the blend used
to form the barrier layer. For example, it is necessary to
blend the liquid with the vinylidene chloride copolymer
over a long period of time (for example 14 to 18 hours).
presence of such a large amount of liquid in the blend can
lead to a loss of homogeneity and to coagulation. This
makes it necessary to delump the blend by performing a
crushing operation. Moreover, variations in the
homogeneity in the
