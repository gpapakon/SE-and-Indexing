<ABSTRACT>
Device for protecting a fluid flow duct with elements 
for interrupting delivery to prevent leaks along the flow 

duct having the particularity of comprising an intake 
chamber (2) located upstream of a fluid flow duct (6) to be 

protected and a delivery chamber (11) located downstream of 
the fluid flow duct (6). An auxiliary connection duct (15) 

runs between the intake chamber (2) and the delivery 
chamber (11). A shutter (20) is located in the intake 

chamber (2) and controls the ports (21,22) for connection 
to the fluid flow duct (6) and to the auxiliary duct (15). 

The shutter (20) is normally closed on said port (21) for 
connection to the fluid flow duct (6) and opens when a load 

loss occurs in the delivery chamber (11). There are also 
one-way valve elements (30,32) located at the ports (31,33) 

for the connection of the fluid flow duct (6) and of the 
auxiliary duct (15) to the delivery chamber (11) and 

suitable to allow the flow of fluids from the ducts (6,15) 
to the delivery chamber (11) but not vice versa.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
protecting a fluid flow duct with means for interrupting 
delivery if leaks occur along the flow duct. As is known, in many fields in which it is necessary 
to deliver fluids, whether liquid or gaseous, there is the 
problem of being able to intervene automatically to 
interrupt delivery of the fluid if leaks occur along the 
duct. A typical case involves the portion of pipe that 
allows to connect water delivery faucets to the water 
supply system. This pipe portion, normally constituted by a hose, 
tends to break due to various causes, such as for example a 
sudden increase in the pressure in the distribution system, 
or a crack in the hose caused by undue bending and the 
like; this leakage is particularly dangerous, since the 
water flow continues to supply the leak, causing severe 
damage, if it is not possible to intervene quickly. In order to solve this problem, solutions have already 
been devised that in practice are based on the use of 
electric valves which are located on the delivery duct and 
are controlled by humidity sensors which, by detecting the 
presence of water on the floor, cause the intervention of 
the electric valve which closes the circuit. Obviously these solutions are considerably complicated 
both structurally and in terms of installation, and are 
therefore extremely expensive; accordingly, their use is  
 
considerably limited. A principal aim of the present invention is indeed to 
solve the problem described above by providing a device for 
protecting a fluid flow duct with means for interrupting 
delivery if leaks occur along the flow duct, said device 
being able to operate without having to use electric valves 
or in any case an external electric power supply, but 
simply by using the pressure of the fluid being supplied. Within the scope of this aim, a particular object of 
the invention is to provide a protection device that can be 
installed without having to modify the conditions that 
typically occur for example when a faucet is installed. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a protection device wherein the supply of fluid to the duct 
is normally blocked and allowed only when the delivery is 
opened and the flow of fluid is required. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a device for protecting a fluid flow duct with means for 
interrupting delivery to prevent leaks along the flow duct 
which, by virtue of its particular constructive 
characteristics, is capable of giving the

<CLAIMS>
Device for protecting a fluid flow duct with means 
for interrupting delivery to prevent leaks along the flow 

duct, characterized in that it comprises: an intake chamber 
(2) located upstream of a fluid flow duct (6) to be 

protected; a delivery chamber (11) located downstream of 
said fluid flow duct (6); an auxiliary connection duct (15) 

that runs between said intake chamber (2) and said delivery 
chamber (11); a shutter (20) that is located in said intake 

chamber (2), controls the ports (21,22) for connection to 
said fluid flow duct (6) and to said auxiliary duct (15), 

is normally closed on said port (21) for connection to said 
fluid flow duct, and opens when a load loss occurs in said 

delivery chamber (11); and one-way valve means which are 
located at the ports (31,33) for the connection of said 

fluid flow duct (6) and of said auxiliary duct (15) to said 
delivery chamber (11) and are suitable to allow the flow of 

fluids from said ducts (6,15) to said delivery chamber 
(11). 
Protection device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said auxiliary duct (15) has a 

smaller useful passage section than said fluid flow duct 
(6). 
Protection device according to the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises elastic means 

(25) acting on said shutter (20) to push it so that it 
closes on said port (21) for connection to said fluid flow 

duct. 
Protection device according to one or more of the 
 

preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises, 
around said shutter (20), an annular seepage region (40) 

that allows fluid to flow toward said auxiliary duct (15), 
said seepage being suitable to drag said shutter (20) so 

that it closes against said port (22) for connection to 
said auxiliary duct when the fixture for draining off the 

liquid is opened.
