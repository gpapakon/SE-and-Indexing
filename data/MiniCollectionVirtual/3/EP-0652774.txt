<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions for the topical 
administration of drugs, especially such compositions having 
enhanced penetration of the drug through the skin. Because of the accessibility and large area of the skin, it 
has long been considered a promising route for the administration 
of drugs, whether dermal, regional, or systemic effects are 
desired. The advantages of the topical route of drug administration 
include: avoidance of the risks and inconvenience of parenteral 
treatment; avoidance of the variable absorption and metabolism 
associated with oral treatment; continuity of drug administration, 
permitting use of pharmacologically active agents with short 
biological half-lives; potential reduction of gastrointestinal 
irritation in systemic administration; and treatment of cutaneous 
manifestations of diseases usually treated systemically. However, the impermeability of skin is well-known, serving as 
a barrier to ingress of pathogens and toxic chemicals, and egress 
of physiologic fluids. This impermeability is the result of 
normal physiologic changes in developing skin. A typical cell in 
the epidermis is formed in the basal layer. It typically takes 
approximately thirty days for a cell to migrate from the basal 
layer of the epidermis to sloughing off and discarding at the 
outer layers of the stratum corneum. As the cell migrates outward 
from the basal layer, it progressively keratinizes until it is 
relatively impermeable. The result is the stratum corneum, an 
extremely thin surface layer (10 microns) with substantial barrier 
properties. The cell envelopes of the cells in the stratum 
corneum tend to be mainly polar lipids, such as ceramides, 
sterols, and fatty acids while the cytoplasm of stratum corneum 
cells remains polar and aqueous. Despite the close packing of the  
 
cells, some 15% of the stratum corneum is intercellular and, 
generally, lipid based. It is generally recognized that over the 
very short term, penetration occurs through the hair follicles and 
the sebaceous apparatus; long-term penetration occurs across cells 
(non-polar route). Poor penetration of many drugs across the 
epidermal lipid barrier has, until now, frustrated attempts to 
deliver clinically significant doses of many drugs by the topical 
route. One route of delivery of drugs is by transdermal 
administration. Transdermal administration of drugs can be used 
in many instances to achieve therapeutic levels of the drugs in 
the systemic circulatory system, as well as for more
