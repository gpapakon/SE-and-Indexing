<ABSTRACT>
The system is used where a pipe (2,3) with fire-protection devices is provided in ducting in a ceiling (8) or wall. A sound-protection cover (26) is provided adjoining the fire-protection devices (8) and enclosing the pipe at least in the area of the ducting (4). A double sleeve can be provided inside the fire protection device (8) and/or sound protective cover to connect the pipes (2,3). The or each sleeve can have indents (38) to hold rings (39) of resilient material to prevent direct contact between pipe and sleeve. The fire protection device can be a layer of inflatable material whose ID is equal to or greater than the OD of the sleeve.

Partitioning device for the simultaneous reduction of sound transmission in a duct 
(4) through a ceiling (6) or wall of a building, a pipe (2, 3) being provided in the 

duct (4), said device containing a fire protection means (8) with a layer (18) of 
expandable material surrounding the pipe, characterised in that a sound-absorbing 

hood (26) surrounding the pipe (2, 3) at a distance is provided immediately axially 
downstream of the fire protection means (8) in the region of the duct (4), that the 

sound-absorbing hood (26) consists of flexible material or is composed of two 
parts, the abutting or overlapping longitudinal edges being connected together, and 

that at least one layer (24, 25) of sound-insulating material is provided between the 
outer surface (22) of the pipe (3) and the layer (18) of expandable material. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that a sleeve (7), preferably in the 
form of a double sleeve, is provided within the fire protection means (8) and/or the 

sound-absorbing hood (26) for connecting the two pipes (2, 3). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the sleeve (7) contains at least 
one bead (38), at least four beads (38) in the case of a double sleeve, a ring (39) of 

flexible material being arranged in the respective bead (38) in such a manner that 
there can be no direct contact between the pipe (2, 3) and the sleeve (7) and/or 

that the internal diameter (42) of the sound-absorbing hood (26) is at least equal to 
or greater than the external diameter of the sleeve (7) and/or its bead (38). 
Device according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised in that the layer (18) of 
expandable material has an internal diameter equal to or greater than the external 

diameter of the sleeve (7) or its bead (38). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the internal 
diameter (42) of the sound-absorbing hood (26) is substantially equal to the 

internal diameter (19) of the layer (18) of expandable material of the fire protection 
means (8).  

 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the layer (24, 25) of 
sound-insulating material is annular. 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 6, characterised in that the layer (25) is 
arranged between the outer surface of the sleeve (7) and the inner surface of the 

fire protection means (8). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the sound-absorbing 
hood (26) is provided at its end remote from the fire protection means (8) with an 

in particular upper edge (32) arranged at a predetermined distance (34) from an 

upper edge (36) of the ceiling (6). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the sound-absorbing 
hood (26) provided downstream of the fire protection means (8) overlaps the fire 

protection means (8) over a predetermined, preferably expanded region (30), this 
region (30) in particular being in the form of a substantially L-shaped collar, and/or 

that the region (30) is expanded in relation to the remaining part of the sound-absorbing 
hood (26) and/or that the region (30) embraces the fire protection means 

(8) over a predetermined length, the length (44) in particular being between 2 and 
4 cm and preferably substantially 3 cm. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the abutting or 
overlapping longitudinal edges of the sound-absorbing hood (26) are connected by 

means of an adhesive tape or by means of a glued joint.
