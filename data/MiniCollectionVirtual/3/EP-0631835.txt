<CLAIMS>
A cutting tool, in particular a reamer, having a knife plate held on the tool head by means
of a securing arrangement in the form of a snap-action locking means, characterised in

that the knife plate (7) has at least one locking surface (27), and a cavity (33) is made in a
lateral face (15) of a cavity (5) receiving at least part of the knife plate (7) and houses a

locking element (29) which is movable against a yielding force and which acts upon the
locking surface (27) with a locking force.
A cutting instrument in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the knife plate (7)
comprises a projection (23), in that the locking surface (27) is provided on the projection

(23), and in that a recess (25) is provided which receives the projection and in the wall of
which the cavity is made.
A cutting instrument in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in
that the cavity is in the form of an annular groove (33) or a bore, the centre line thereof

being arranged at an angle to the centre line (31) of the recess (25).
A cutting tool in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that at least one spring
element is inserted into the annular groove (33) and is preferably in the form of a spring

ring.
A cutting tool in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that a spring element is
inserted into the bore, the spring element preferably comprising a ball movable against

the force of a spring or being in the form of a spring pin.
A cutting tool in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the
locking surface (27) is inclined at an angle α of approximately 0° to 25 °, in particular

approximately 10° to 20 °, preferably approximately 15 °, the angle opening in the
direction of the insertion direction of the projection.
A cutting tool in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the
projection (23) is provided with a leading slope (37) in the region of its end surface, this

leading slope (37) contacting the locking element (29) upon insertion of the projection 
(23) into the recess (25) and urging the locking element (29) into an unlocking position,

and in that the leading slope is inclined at an angle β of approximately 10° to 60°, in
particular approximately 20° to 45 ° and preferably approximately 35°, in such a manner

that the angle opens in an opposite direction to the insertion direction of the projection.
A cutting tool in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
projection (23) is substantially circular-cylindrical and the recess (25) is substantially

circular.
A cutting tool in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the
projection (23) issues from the underside (21) of the knife plate (7; 7/2; 7/3; 7/4), the

underside facing the tool head.
A cutting tool in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the

recess (25) is made in the main body (3) of the tool head.
A cutting tool in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that
the securing arrangement (19) is such that the knife plate (7; 7/2; 7/3; 7/4) can be pushed

aside in a preselectable direction.
A cutting tool in accordance with Claim 11, characterised in that the direction of the
clamping force of the locking element (29) acting upon the locking surface (27) can be

predetermined in such a manner that the knife plate (7) can be pushed aside in a
preselectable direction.
A cutting tool in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised by an adjusting
device (45).
A cutting tool in accordance with Claim 13, characterised in that the adjusting device (45)
is such that the knife plate (7; 7/2; 7/3; 7/4) is movable against the pushing-aside force

preselectable by the securing arrangement (19).
A cutting tool in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised by an
ejecting device (39) counteracting the securing arrangement (19).
