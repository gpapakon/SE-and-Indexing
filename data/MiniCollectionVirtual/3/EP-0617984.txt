<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides methods for making 
gases generated in the treatment of polyvinyl chloride 

wastes harmless by neutralization and dissolving, and an 
apparatus thereof, and a suction-type solution filter 

container to be used, and providing to shape useful 
materials or components, such as activated carbon with 

excellent adsorbability, from the post-treated residues of 
the wastes. 
Polyvinyl chloride wastes are put in the sealed 
container 1 and heated at 400°C or less without oxygen 

or with air-blocked condition; the gases from the wastes, 
such as chlorine or hydrogen chloride, are sucked to 

extract from the container; the extracted gases are 
introduced into the suction-type solution filter container 

with liquid filtration agents to pass therethrough; 
chlorine is removed and reduced in volume from the wastes 

in the sealed container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for making noxious gases
harmless and odorless after neutralization or dissolving and
to an apparatus thereof, when the gases are generated in the
disposal of wastes, such as polyvinyl chloride films and
sheets; and this invention relates to a suction-type solution
filter container used thereby, and methods for forming carbon
materials, such as an activated carbon with excellent
absorbability from the residue after heat-treating the
disposal as described, or for salvaging the disposal as a tar
component, or methods for forming civil engineering and
building materials after drying and setting the tar component,
without leaving any disposal residues.Polyvinyl chloride films applied to agricultural or
horicultural vinyl houses are used for a fixed period, and
then replaced with a new one because of the deterioration of
optical transmission or serviceability with age or by dust
adhesion.As a result, used polyvinyl chloride films arise, and it is
necessary to dispose of them with a certain method. If the
used films are heat-treated with an ordinary refuse
incinerator under 
the air (oxygen) atmosphere, the incineration temperature rises
higher with the generation of noxious gases, such as a hydrogen
chloride gas and dioxins (popularly known as
chlorodibenzoxines), and of a malodor, so that the refuse
incinerator will be damaged, or polution will be caused.
Therefore, the heat treatment is seldomly practiced.Further methods include a method for extracting the oils from
polyvinyl chloride to be salvaged, or of throwing the used films
into reclaimed land without any treatment; the former, however,
causes problems with salvage costs and efficiency, the latter
makes the land loose and destroys the natural circulation
system; therefore, these are not excellent methods.Thus, it is suggested that the waste plastic materials including
chloric polymer compounds, such as polyvinyl chloride, should be
treated making generated gases, such as hydrogen chloride gases,
harmless. In Japanese Provisional Publication No. 3040 of 1988,
for example, a fusing-setting method was provided for heating
and fusing waste plastic materials at pyrolysis temperature of
at least 150 °C or more with crushing and kneading, while
calcium salts were introducted, so that the harmful hydrogen
chloride gases generated would be rendered harmless by the
salts. This method conducted under the air atmosphere (oxygen),
however, has a potential for generating harmful materials to the
human body and a danger of
