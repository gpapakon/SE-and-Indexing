<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas turbine engine transmission 
systems. In particular the invention concerns transmission 
systems suitable for effecting power transfer between 
independently rotatable engine shafts in multispool gas 
turbine engines. A two-spool gas turbine engine arrangement in accordance with 
the pre-characterising of claim 1 appended hereto is known 
from GB Patent No 971,690. This engine arrangement comprises 
a high pressure spool consisting of a high pressure turbine 
section joined by a connecting shaft to a high pressure 
compressor section. A second, low pressure spool consisting 
of a low pressure turbine section and a low pressure 
compressor section are connected by a second shaft disposed 
concentrically with the first shaft. A third shaft is mounted 
concentrically with the other two shafts and is coupled to the 
low pressure spool shaft in order to act alternatively as a 
starter motor power input or as an auxiliary generator power 
offtake. However, the high and low pressure spools are 
coupled one to the other only by means of the engine gas path. 
Also the starter motor/auxiliary generator unit comprises a 
power transfer machine coupled to the low pressure engine 
spool and is capable of operating in forward or reverse power 
transfer mode according to whether the unit is to be operated 
as a starter motor or as a generator. However, this power 
transfer means is coupled to the single spool only and to an 
external connection, and contains no provision for power 
transfer between the spools of the engine. A multispool gas turbine 10 having a conventional transmission 
system is shown schematically in Figure 1. 
The gas turbine engine shown comprises, in flow series, a 
front fan assembly 12 and a core engine 14. The engine is of  
 
the ducted fan by-pass type and has three relatively rotatable 
spools including a low pressure spool 16, an intermediate 
pressure spool 18, and a high pressure spool 20. The low 
pressure spool includes a fan 12, a multistage turbine 
assembly 22 located at the downstream end of the core engine, 
and an interconnecting load transmitting shaft 24 rotatable 
about engine axis 26. The intermediate pressure spool 18 
includes a multistage axial flow compressor 28, a turbine 
rotor assembly 30, and a hollow interconnecting shaft 32 
concentrically disposed around engine shaft 24. The engine's 
high pressure spool 20 similarly includes a multistage axial 
flow compressor 34, a turbine rotor assembly 36, and an 
interconnecting shaft 38
