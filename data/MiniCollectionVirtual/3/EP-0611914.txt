<ABSTRACT>
This device is composed of a tube (duct) capable of adopting a greater diameter when it is turned inside out and which is placed behind a mobile boring machine and is laid progressively in step with the advancement of the machine. The tube (1) is flexible and includes longitudinal slots (2) on the inside or may be composed of two separate layers and may be consolidated with the aid of injected material or of a former as it is turned inside out. After the turning-inside-out has been initiated, the machine, which may be composed of moving modules (a, b, c) and of a boring head (d), with the aid of a jack (5) equipped with a gripping system (6), grasps the tube on its inside diameter and pulls it towards itself, which leads to the tube being turned inside out progressively. This invention is intended for the laying of underground connections.
