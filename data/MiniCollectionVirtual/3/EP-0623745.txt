<ABSTRACT>
A swash plate type refrigerant compressor comprises a compressor housing 
enclosing therein a crank chamber, a suction chamber and a discharge chamber. A 

swash plate is tiltably connected to the drive shaft and has two sliding sufaces at axial 
sides thereof. The swash plate includes a sliding surface which engages a plurality of 

pairs of shoes. The shoes couple the swash plate to the pistons so that the pistons may 
be driven in a reciprocating motion within the cylinder bores upon rotation of the swash 

plate. At least one groove is formed in the sliding contact surfaces between the swash 
plate and the shoes. The groove captures and retains lubricating oil in the refrigerant 

in response to the rotation of the swash plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a swash plate type refrigerant 
compressor and, more particularly, to a lubricating mechanism between the shoe and 
swash plate. A swash plate type refrigerant compressor suitable for use in an 
automotive air condition system is disclosed in, for example, US-A-4,568,252 
to Ikeda et al. The Ikeda et al. swash plate compressor includes a pair of axially aligned 
front and rear cylinder blocks enclosed at both ends by front and rear housings. Valve 
plates are positioned between the respective cylinder blocks and the front and rear 
housings. The front and rear housings form suction chambers discharge chambers, 
and a plurality of aligned cylinder bores are arranged around the central axis of the 
cylinder blocks. Each of the cylinder bores have interconnecting suction chambers and 
discharge chambers formed in the front and rear housings. The cylinder blocks also 
have a central longitudinal bore formed therein. A drive shaft is rotatably mounted in 
the longitudinal bores. A swash plate chamber is formed between the cylinder blocks 
and a swash plate, keyed on the drive shaft, is rotatably received in the swash plate 
chamber. The swash plate rotates with the drive shaft and operatively engages 
double-headed pistons slidably fitted in the cylinder bores. More specifically, the swash 
plate is coupled to the pistons through shoes. The shoes provide a universal coupling 
allowing a reciprocatory compressing motion of the pistons within the cylinder bores in 
response to the rotation of the swash plate. The central portion of each of the double 
headed pistons is provided with a recess through which the swash plate passes during 
the rotation thereof, and a pair of spherical sockets to receive the shoes. Each of the 
shoes has a circular flat face in sliding contact with the oblique face of the swash plate 
and a half-spherical face in sliding engagement with the socket of the associated piston. When the Ikeda et al. compressor is used for compressing a refrigerant 
gas in the air-conditioning system of a vehicle, the refrigerant gas, which contains a  
 
lubricating oil, is introduced from outside of the air-conditioning circuit into the suction 
chamber, via the swash plate chamber, and is discharged from the compressor to other 
components in the air-conditioning circuit. The lubricating oil contained in the 
refrigerant gas lubricates the contacting surfaces of the shoes and the swash plate and 
respective sockets of the pistons. However, since the circular
