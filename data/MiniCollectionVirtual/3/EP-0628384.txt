<ABSTRACT>
Fastening elements (28) which serve to fasten insulating panels (30) to building components (31) are fixed by means of setting tools. With the aid of a connecting region (26a), which produces a frictional force, on a guide tube (25) of the setting tool, it is possible to carry out a setting check once the setting operation is completed. For this purpose, the frictional force between the guide tube (25) and the interior of the hollow shaft (28b) of the fastening element (28) is greater than the frictional force between hollow shaft (28b) and insulating panels (30).

Process for placing fastening elements (28, 38) serving to fasten
insulating plates (30) on assembly components (31) by means of

a setting tool which is driven by high-pressure gases, and the
fastening element (28, 38) comprises a large head, a hollow shaft

(28b, 38b) which protrudes from the head (28a, 38a) and passes
through the insulating plates (30), as well as an abutment (28a,

38a) for a nail (29, 39) which is driven into the assembly
components (31) by the setting tool, 
characterised in that
 the
fastening element (28, 38) is prior to driving in the nail (29, 39)

connected to the mouth area of the setting tool, and the
connection between setting tool and fastening element is

released after the nail (29, 39) has been driven in whilst
overcoming a force which exceeds the frictional load between

hollow shaft (28b, 38b) and the insulation plate (30).
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
fastening element (28, 38) is connectable to the mouth area of

the setting tool whilst inserting a guide tube (5, 15, 25) into the
hollow shaft (28b, 38b).
Device for carrying out the process according to Claim 1,

characterised by
 a setting tool which is driven by high pressure
gas, and the fastening element (28, 38) comprises a large head,

a hollow shaft (28b, 38b) which protrudes from the head (28a,
38a) and passes through the insulating plates (30), and an

abutment (28a, 38a) for a nail (29, 39) which is to be driven by
the setting tool into the assembly components (31), and the

fastening element (28, 38) is connectable to the mouth area of
the setting tool prior to driving in the nail (29, 39), and the

connection between setting tool and fastening element is
releasable after the nail (29, 39) has been driven in whilst

overcoming a frictional load between hollow shaft (28b, 38b) and
insulating plate (30).
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the setting
tool comprises a guide tube (5, 15, 25) with a connecting area

(5a, 16a, 26a). 
Device according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the
connecting area (5a, 16a, 26a) is profiled.
Device according to one of Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that

the connecting area (16a, 26a) is arranged on a separate part
(16, 26) which is adjustable relative to the guide tube (15, 25).
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the inside
contour of the hollow shaft (28b, 38b) of the fastening element

(28, 38) comprises an opposing area.
Device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the opposing
area of the inside contour of the hollow shaft (28b, 38b) is

profiled.
Device according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the
profilation is formed by longitudinal webs (40, 41) which at least

partially extend along the inside contour of the hollow shaft (38b).
Device according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 a plurality of
longitudinal webs (40, 41) is arranged over the periphery of the

inside contour of the hollow shaft (38b).
Device according to Claim 9 or 10, 
characterised in that
 the
clearance of the hollow shaft (38b), which is defined by the

longitudinal webs (40, 41), is cylindrical.
