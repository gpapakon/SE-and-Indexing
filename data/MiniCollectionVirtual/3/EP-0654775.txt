<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a map information regenerating device 
usable in a vehicle travel guiding apparatus, which is 

capable of freely revising a road map, i.e., adding, 
changing and deleting a road on the road map without 

changing data stored in a basic map-information storage 
but correlating change data with existing roads to 

assure the possibility of performing map-data 
processing such as course searching according to 

revised map data. 
The device is so constructed that a map 
information may be read-out from a map information 

storage and stored in a buffer memory wherein the data 
are revised in a specified procedure according to map 

change data read-out from an additionally used storage 
medium or/and obtained by using transmitting/receiving 

means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a map information
regenerating device.The Japanese laid open patent publication No. 4-50718
discloses a vehicle travel guiding apparatus
which is capable of displaying a current location of a
vehicle on a road map shown on a display screen on the
basis of area-map data read from a map-information
storage medium by successively determining two-dimensional
coordinates of the vehicle by cumulative
calculation of detected distances and a direction of
its travelling. This apparatus is characterized in that
a current location of the vehicle, which is indicated
out of a road on the road map as a result of an
accumulated error, can be corrected in such a procedure
that a pattern of the vehicle's travel trace to the
present location and a pattern of a selected road
extracted from the map data are compared with each
other for a match and then is aligned with the matched
road.The Japanese laid open patent publication No. 62-133600
discloses another travel guiding apparatus for
a vehicle, which is capable of setting a start point 
and a target point on a road map shown on a display
screen and searching digital map data to find an
optimal (e.g., the shortest) course therebetween for
the purpose of guiding the vehicle.Map information to be used in the above-mentioned
guiding apparatuses is generally stored as digitized
data in a read only storage medium, e.g., CD-ROM. When
the map is partly changed, for example, with addition
of a new road, the storage medium in use shall be
replaced with new revised one. To cope with any change
made in the road map, it is proposed to use an
additional read only memory (e.g., an IC card) for
storing only revised map data, e.g., data relating to a
new road or roads, in such a way that any changed
information (e.g., a new road) may be read-out from the
additional ROM and its image may be overlapped on a
road map indicated on the. screen, which corresponds to
the basic (not revised) data read from the data base
stored in the road map-information storage.The drawbacks involved in the prior art devices are
as follows:First, every time a road map is even partly
changed, which may frequently occur, it is required to
replace a full storage medium with new one. It is
wasteful to use the storage medium in that way.In case when the additional ROM for storing changed 
data of the road map is used to read therefrom a
necessary changed data of the road map and to display
displaying the changed portion image by overlapping it
on a basic road map displayed on a
