<ABSTRACT>
To provide an information processing apparatus in which arbitrary 
removal of a device for processing information accommodated within a main 

body can be prevented, regardless of operation of an eject button or the 
like, and to provide an information processing apparatus in which such 

prevention can be realized in a simple structure and at a low cost. 
A card insertion portion 80 accommodates PCMCIA cards 84. An 
engaging member 88 is provided so as to be freely installable and 

removable from the card insertion portion 80. In an installed state, the 
engaging member 88 corresponds to the PCMCIA cards 84 so as to prevent 

removal of the PCMCIA cards 84. The engaging member 88 is covered by a 
keyboard 22 when the keyboard 22 is closed. By selectively using the 

engaging member 88 and closing the keyboard 22, the engaging member 88 is 
prevented from being removed. Accordingly, the PCMCIA cards 84 are 

prevented from being removed from the card insertion portion 80. A 
single engaging member 88 can prevent removal of the PCMCIA cards 84, 

regardless of operation of eject buttons 86. An information processing 
apparatus, which can realize such prevention in a simple structure and at 

a low cost, is thereby obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to information processing apparatus, 
and more particularly to an information processing apparatus in which a 
device for processing information is accommodated within a main body so 
as to be installable and removable. In an information processing apparatus, e.g., a portable 
information processing apparatus, a hard disk drive (HDD), a floppy disk 
drive (FDD), a battery or the like can be formed as a cartridge type 
package. This type of package, which is accommodated within the main 
body so as to be installable and removable, is widely used. In addition, 
an installable and removable type of thin card, e.g., a ROM card, may be 
used. In this type of information processing apparatus, a user can 
install and remove the aforementioned HDD package, ROM card or the like. 
Accordingly, by replacing the HDD package, the ROM card or the like with 
an HDD package, a ROM card or the like storing different information, an 
information processing apparatus can be made to accommodate more 
functions. Further, communication between personal computers is possible 
if a communication card such as a modem card is used. Further, because 
various packages and cards can be installed and removed, maintenance of 
the data processor is facilitated. The HDD package, the ROM card and the like are very expensive and 
information stored therein must be protected. Therefore, it is necessary 
to prevent arbitrary removal (such as theft) of the HDD package, the ROM 
card and the like from the main body. In particular, the aforementioned ROM card or the like which is 
installable and removable can be easily removed from the main body by 
operation of an eject button. Therefore, it is necessary to have a 
mechanism which can prevent removal of such devices from the main body, 
regardless of the operation of the eject button. For a device such as a ROM card or the like accommodated within the 
main body, a security mechanism formed by a cover or the like which  
 
completely covers an opening for inserting a card can be prevented. In 
this case, the security mechanism is complicated and expensive, and the 
processor as a whole becomes large as space for the security mechanism 
must be provided. Further, if a modem card or the like equipped with a 
communication cable is used, the opening for inserting the card cannot be 
completely covered, and the problem of undesired removal of the device 
remains unsolved. As a result, a simple security mechanism has been 
desired for devices such as a ROM card or

<CLAIMS>
An information processing apparatus comprising: 
   a main body in which a device for processing information is 

accommodated so as to be installable and removable via an opening; 
   a preventing member freely mountable to and removable from said 

main body, said preventing member preventing said device from being 
removed from said opening for a device when said preventing member is 

mounted to said main body; and 
   means for preventing removal of said preventing member from said 

main body. 
An information processing apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein 
the preventing member removal preventing means has: a cover mounted to 

said main body so as to be freely opened and closed, said cover 
preventing removal of said preventing member from said main body when 

said cover is closed; and 
   a movable member mounted to said main body, said movable member 

being movable between a state in which said movable member protrudes from 
the exterior of said main body and a state in which said movable member 

is withdrawn into said main body, and in the state in which said movable 
member is exposed to the exterior from said main body, said movable 

member prevents the opening of said cover.
