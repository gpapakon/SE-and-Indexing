<ABSTRACT>
A metal halide lamp comprises a sealed tube (10) 
containing mercury vapor and halide, and electrodes (20a,20b) 

extending to a center of the sealed tube, supported by 
sealed portions (20a,20b) at both ends of the sealed tube. A notch (28) 

extending in a direction perpendicular to an axis of the 
electrode is formed in each electrode. A transverse 

cross sectional area of a portion where the notch is 
formed is smaller than the transverse cross sectional 

area of another portions and functions as a heat dam 
portion for damming heat. Accordingly, temperature of a 

proximal portion from the heat dam portion to the support 
portion is lower than that of the same portion of the 

conventional electrode, and temperature of a distal end 
portion is higher than that of the same portion of the 

conventional electrode. Thus, formation of low-melting 

alloy due to reaction of the proximal portion of the 
electrode and the metal halide can be suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal halide 
lamp, and more particularly to an electrode utilized in a 
metal halide lamp. A metal halide lamp is an electric discharge lamp in 
which metal halides are added to the contents of a sealed 
tube or a bulb, and a lamp which is capable of improving 
luminous efficiency and color rendering properties 
utilizing a spectral line of each added metal atoms or 
emission of molecular spectrum of each metal halide and, 
if desired, capable of obtaining emission in a certain 
wavelength region. These metal halide lamps are utilized 
as wide illumination for roads, sports fields etc., room 
lighting for stores, a light source for an overhead 
projector, a liquid crystal projector, a slide projector 
etc. Conventionally, a cylindrical tungsten electrode 
having the same diameter along its entire length, a 
tungsten electrode in which a diameter of a proximal 
portion (portion near a sealed portion of a bulb) is 
large, which is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. HEI 5-82086 (82086/1993), and a tapered tungsten  
 
electrode in which a diameter gradually becomes small 
from a distal end or an inner end to a proximal portion, 
which is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. HEI 
4-280057 (280057/1992) are known as tungsten electrodes 
used in general metal halide lamps. In these conventional metal halide lamps, a part of 
an electrode near a sealed portion of a bulb reacts with a 
metal halide and generates a low-melting alloy. This 
low-melting alloy tends to deposit on a spherical portion 
or luminous portion of the bulb to whiten the luminous 
portion. Further, the deposited low-melting alloy may 
react with silica glass of which the bulb is made, thereby 
to occur crystallization, which may cause decrease of 
pressure resistance of a bulb and damage of a bulb. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
metal halide lamp which is capable of suppressing 
formation of low-melting alloy inside a bulb or capable 
of suppressing deposit of formed low-melting alloy to an 
inner wall surface of a bulb. To attain the above-mentioned object, a metal halide 
lamp of the present invention comprises: a sealed tube 
capable of transmitting light therethrough, containing 
metal vapor and halide therein; and a pair of electrodes 
supported by support portions of the sealed tube, each of 
said electrodes having an distal end which extends to the  
 
inside of the sealed tube and the electrodes being 
arranged so that the distal ends are opposed and spaced
