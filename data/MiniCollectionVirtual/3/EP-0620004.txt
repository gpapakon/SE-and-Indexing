<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical
composition containing S-adenosyl-L-methionine or a salt
thereof as an active ingredient. More particularly, this
invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for use
as a nephrotoxicity alleviator capable of alleviating the
nephrotoxicity caused by a drug administered to the living
organism, which composition contains S-adenosyl-L-methionine
or a salt thereof (hereinafter referred to as
SAMes), and also to a pharmaceutical composition for use as
an antitumor activity potentiator capable of potentiating
the antitumor activity of a platinum complex compound,
which composition contains SAMes as an active ingredient.A variety of drugs have currently been in use for the
treatment of different malignant tumors. Cisplatin (cis-diamine-dichloroplatinum:
CDDP), above all, is an
excellent drug with which an increase in life span can be
expected, and has shown a significant life span-extending
effect, in particular in the treatment of testicular tumor,
bladder cancer, ureteral tumor and ovarian cancer. While
CDDP has excellent antitumor activity, it produces serious
toxicity and, above all, its nephrotoxicity is considered 
as a dose-regulating factor. In order to alleviate such
toxicity, such measures as the simultaneous use of
diuretics upon administration of CDDP and hydration have
been taken, although the toxicity-alleviating effects of
these measures are not satisfactory in some patients. In
particular where CDDP is repeatedly administered, its
accumulated toxicity tends to grow to a point where in
certain patients with manifested nephrotoxicity its dose is
obliged to be reduced or the drug has to be replaced, with
the result that the otherwise possible life span extension
is lost. The nephrotoxicity is a serious problem in other
therapies as well, for example, in the treatment of ovarian
cancer wherein the dose of CDDP is increased, while making
administration intervals as short as possible, to enhance
the dose intensity. In order to overcome such problems,
many attempts to search for compounds capable of
alleviating CDDP's nephrotoxicity have been made. Thus,
for example, such compounds as sodium thiosulfate,
acetazolamide, selenium dioxide, sodium selenate, cysteine,
3-aminobenzamide, phosphomycin and bismuth subnitrate have
been reported to show nephrotoxicity-alleviating activity,
although these compounds have yet to be put into practical
use clinically. Furthermore recent years have seen
extensive developments of drugs possessing
