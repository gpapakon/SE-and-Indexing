<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of an ether alcohol is 
disclosed, which comprises subjecting a cyclic ketal to 

hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst containing 
palladium in an amount of from 50 to 100 % by weight, based 

on the total active catalytic component present. According 
to the inventive process, ether alcohols which are useful as 

perfumes or raw materials for perfumes can be produced easily 
with low cost and high yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an industrially
advantageous process for the production of ether alcohols
which are useful as perfumes or raw material for perfumes.There are a large number of oxygen-containing
hydrocarbon compounds, including alcohols and esters, which
are useful as perfumes. For example, ether alcohols obtained
from glycols and alcohols are known as important perfumes.
In the prior art production processes, these ether alcohols
are produced, for example, by (1) addition reaction of a
glycol compound to an olefin compound (U.S. Patent
4,393,247), (2) reduction of an allyl ether hydroformyl
compound (U.S. Patent 4,521,634), (3) addition reaction of an
alcohol with an epoxide (as disclosed in JP-A-58-159435 (U.S.
Patent 4,608,445); the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application") and (4)
hydrogenation of an epoxide-added phenol (as disclosed in JP-A-4-217937,
(corresponding to U.S. Patent 5,194,423)).However, these production processes have several
problems including low production yield, too many production
steps, and the necessity of using hazardous materials such as
sodium hydride and the like. In addition to the above processes, these ether
alcohols are also produced by (5) hydrogenolysis of cyclic
ketals or cyclic acetals prepared from ketones, aldehydes and
the like. Examples of such a process include: a process in
which a cyclic ketal is subjected to reduction in the
presence of lithium aluminum hydride and aluminum chloride
(as disclosed in Organic Synthesis Collective, vol.5, p.303);
a process in which a cyclic ketal is subjected to hydrogenolysis
in the presence of a platinum or rhodium as a
catalyst (as disclosed in JP-A-54-135714 (corresponding to
U.S. Patent 4,088,700)); and a process in which a cyclic
acetal is subjected to hydrogenolysis in the presence of
palladium and phosphoric acid catalysts (as disclosed in JP-A-58-189129
(corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,484,009)), cobalt
carbonyl catalyst (as disclosed in Can. J. Chem., vol.54,
p.685 (1976)), palladium, platinum or the like catalyst (as
disclosed in J.C.S. Chem. Commun., 106 (1981)) or palladium
catalyst (as disclosed in JP-B-1-36450 (corresponding to U.S.
Patent 4,479,017); the term "JP-B" as used herein means an
"examined Japanese patent publication").However, of these processes for the hydrogenolysis of
cyclic ketals and cyclic acetals, the process in which
lithium aluminum hydride is used has a problem from an
industrial production point of view because the reagent is
expensive
