<ABSTRACT>
A known arrangement for linking a processor and a memory creates 
additional address space which is larger than the available address space of the 

processor and offers address adjustments of the addressing, inter alia by 
loading, in response to a first address, data originating from the processor as 

the start address signal for the memory, many registers being used, owing to 
which this arrangement is complex and consequently slow and expensive. By 

means of the simple and consequently fast and inexpensive arrangement 
according to the invention there is generated by the arrangement, in response 

to a second address of the processor, a further address signal for the memory, 
which further address signal is a function of the start address signal and the 

number of second addresses generated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for linking a processor to a 
memory, which arrangement is provided with means for generating, in 
response to a first address originating from the processor, data originating 
from the processor as a start address signal for the benefit of the memory. Such an arrangement is disclosed by EP 0218523. The arrangement 
described therein comprises an ACCESS controller for receiving the first 
address originating from the processor CPU, and ACCESS registers for 
receiving data originating from the processor (see, inter alia, Fig. 1 of EP 
0218523, where bus 20 functions as an address bus and bus 10 functions as a 
data bus, further see, inter alia, page 6, line 11-27 of EP 0218523). The data 
originating from the processor CPU may, in this case, represent both genuine 
data destined for the memory RAM, and an address signal destined for the 
RAM (see, inter alia, page 1, line 22-29 of EP 0218523). With this known 
arrangement it is thus possible to create additional address space which is 
larger than the available address space of the processor (indirect addressing). 
In addition, the known arrangement has so-called operating modes, such as 
the sequential access mode, where START registers and STOP registers 
indicate the boundaries of address space, present in the RAM, which is used 
as a FIFO and is implemented as a circular buffer, and where IN PTR 
registers and OUT PTR registers indicate the subsequent write and read 
address signals and IN INCR registers and OUT INCR registers indicate the 
auto- increments for write and read actions (address adjustment). It is thus  
 
possible to write data into a register and then automatically transfer it to the 
next available address space. A drawback of such a known arrangement is, inter alia, that many 
registers are required therein for supervising the arrangement and for the 
purpose of indirect addressing and automatic indexing. These registers make 
the arrangement complex and thus expensive and slow. The object of the invention is, inter alia, to provide an arrangement of 
the type mentioned in the preamble, by means of which additional address 
space is created which is larger than the available address space of the 
processor, while the arrangement should further be of simple design and thus 
less expensive and faster than existing arrangements. The arrangement according to the invention to this end is 
characterized in that the arrangement is provided with means for generating, 
in response to a second address
