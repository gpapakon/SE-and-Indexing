<ABSTRACT>
The fuel injector valve has a valve housing which projects into the combustion chamber of a cylinder of the internal combustion engine and is provided with a seating surface (18) on its end face facing the combustion chamber. Extending through the valve housing is a movable closing piece (20) which is provided at its end facing the combustion chamber, with a mushroom-shaped valve plug (20') projecting from the valve housing and having a sealing surface (19) that interacts with the seating surface (18). The fuel flowing through the valve housing opens the valve, fuel being injected into the combustion chamber under elevated pressure. Arranged on the valve housing is a cap that overlaps the mushroom-shaped valve plug (20') and, in the region of the seating surface (18), has at least one nozzle passage (21) for the formation of a fuel jet.

A fuel injection valve for a reciprocating internal 
combustion engine, having a valve housing (1) protruding 

into the combustion chamber (7) of a cylinder of the 
engine, which on its end face faced towards the 

combustion chamber comprises a seat (18), and having a 
moveable closing part (20, 40) extending through the 

valve housing, which on its end faced towards the 
combustion chamber is provided with a mushroom-head-shaped 

valve cone (20', 40') protruding from the valve 
housing and comprising a sealing surface (18) cooperating 

with the seat, and which opens in the direction of flow 
of the fuel flowing through the valve housing, with fuel 

being injected under elevated pressure into the 
combustion chamber (7), with at the valve housing (1) a 

cap (8, 48) spanning the mushroom-head-shaped valve cone 
of the closing part being provided and with the cap (8, 

48) comprising at least one nozzle duct (21, 41) for 
forming a fuel jet in the region of the seat (18), 


characterised in that
 the sealing surface (19, 42) of the 
valve cone merges into a cylindrical surface at its outer 

periphery and the edge between the sealing surface (42) 
and the cylindrical surface controls the size of the 

inlet cross section of the nozzle duct (21, 41). 
A valve according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the mushroom-head-shaped valve cone 
(20', 40') of the closing part (20, 40) is guided tightly 

along the inside of the cap (8, 48). 
A valve according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the boundary of the nozzle duct 
(21) faced away from the combustion chamber (7) is 

connected to the seat (18) of the valve housing (1).  
 
A valve according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the boundary of the nozzle duct 
(31) faced away from the combustion chamber is displaced 

towards the combustion chamber relative to the seat (18) 
of the valve housing (1). 
A valve according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 at least one projection (45) is 
provided at the valve cone (40), which protrudes into the 

nozzle duct (41). 
A valve according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the cap (8, 48) is provided 
detachably screwed to the valve body (3, 3'). 
A valve according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 a stop face (8'), which determines 
the maximum travel of the closing part (20, 40), is 

constructed on the inside of the cap (8, 48).
