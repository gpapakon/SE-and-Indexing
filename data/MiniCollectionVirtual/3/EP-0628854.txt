<ABSTRACT>
A photographic processing apparatus comprises a first 
magazine (1) for feeding a first sensitive material (S1) 

to the development station and a second magazine (2) for 
feeding a second sensitive material in a direction 

designated at an right angle to the feeding direction of 
the first sensitive material (S2). A first cutter (3) 

separates a first sensitive sheet (S3) from the first 
sensitive material (S1) and a second cutter (4) separates 

a second sensitive sheet (S4) from the second sensitive 
material. The first and second sensitive sheet (S3, S4) 

separated by their respective first and second cutters 
(3, 4) are conveyed over a conveying pass line (8) to the 

development station. A transfer shifting means (5) 
mounted at the intersection of the feeding direction of 

the first sensitive material (S1) and the feeding 
direction of the second sensitive material (S2) transfers 

the second sensitive sheet (S4) to the pass line (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
photographic processing apparatus for carrying out a
sheet processing method in which a roll of sensitive
paper is cut into desired sizes and then exposed to
light.In a conventional photographic processing apparatus
shown in Figure 6, a roll of sensitive sheet material 62
fed from a magazine 61 is cut by a cutter 63 to a size 64
and the sensitive sheet of the size 64 is shifted by a
shifting means 65 to run in a (widthwise) direction at
aright angle to the feeding direction before being
exposed at an exposure stage 66 and delivered further to
a development station (not shown).This arrangement allows two different size sensitive
sheets S1' and S2' to be printed repeatedly (as shown in
figure 7) from a negative film containing a random order
of standard size frames (24 x 36 mm of 135 format) and
panoramic size frames (13 x 36 mm of 135 format).The disadvantage of the foregoing embodiment however
is that the sensitive paper sheets S1' and s2' of which
width b is perpendicular to the width B' of the exposing
stage 66 are not increased in the print size utilising
the maximum exposure area of the exposing stage 66. There is known from GB-A-2103812, an apparatus for
conveying photosensitive material in which, after the
material has been withdrawn from an exposure zone, it is
conveyed in a direction orthogonal to that at which it
was fed into the exposure zone.It is an object of the present invention, in view of
overcoming the above disadvantage, to provide a
photographic processing apparatus in which larger size
prints are produced relating to the maximum exposure area
of an exposing stage while different size prints are
successfully processed without lowering the operating
efficiency.A photographic processing apparatus according to the
present invention is defined in claim 1. In action, while a first sensitive sheet separated
by a first cutter is directly conveyed along a pass
line, a second sensitive sheet separated by a second
cutter is transferred to the pass line by a transfer
shifting means for shifting of its conveying direction to
the direction of the pass line which is at a right angle
to the feeding direction of the second sensitive sheet
and thus conveyed widthwisely thereof.A photographic processing apparatus according to the
invention is preferably characterized in that the
exposure station is located on a lower stream of
intersection of the pass line where the second sensitive
sheet is loaded to allow the shifting of the conveying
direction of the

<CLAIMS>
A photographic processing apparatus for separating
desired size sheets from sensitive material rolls

cut by a cutter, exposing the sheets to light at an
exposure station, and transferring the sheets to the

development station, comprising:

a first magazine (1) for feeding a first sensitive
material (S1) to the development station;
a second magazine (2) for feeding a second sensitive
material (S2) in a direction designated at a right angle

to the feeding direction of the first sensitive material;
a first cutter (3) for separating a first sensitive
sheet (S3) from the first sensitive material (S1);
a second cutter (4) for separating a second sensitive
sheet (S4) from the second sensitive material (S2);
a conveying means (7) for conveying the first and
second sensitive sheet separated by their respective

first and second cutters to the development station;
an exposing stage (6) disposed across a transfer pass
line of the conveying means; and
a converting direction shifting means (5) mounted at
the intersection of the feeding direction of the first

sensitive material (S1) and the feeding direction of the
second sensitive material (S2) for shifting the feeding

direction of the second sensitive sheet (S4) fed from the
second magazine (2) to the feeding direction of the first sensitive sheet so as to transfer the second sensitive

sheet (S4) to the conveying means (7).
A photographic processing apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein the exposing stage is located on the

down stream side of the intersection of the feeding directions
to allow

the shifting in the feeding direction of the second
sensitive sheet (S4) by the direction shifting means (5)

to be executed before exposing action at the exposing
stage.
A photographic processing apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein the exposing stage is located at the

intersection of the feeding directions to allow the shifting in
the conveying direction of the second sensitive sheet

(S4) by the direction shifting means (5) to be executed
after exposing action at the exposing stage.
A photographic apparatus as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the conveying direction shifting

means (5) comprises suction means (51) by which the second
sensitive sheet (S4) is rotated by the direction shifting

means (5) and released to be transferred to the conveying
means (7).
A photographic apparatus as claimed in claim 1,
further comprising a second conveying means (10) for conveying

the second sensitive sheet (S4) to the intersection,
wherein the conveying means (7) is a suction conveying

means for sucking and conveying the second sensitive
sheet (S4) transferred by the second conveying means.
