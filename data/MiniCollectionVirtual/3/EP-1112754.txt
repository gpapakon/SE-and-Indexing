<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus was disclosed comprising a housing having a proximal end and a
distal end, the housing slidably mounted on a needle shaft below a needle distal tip, the

clip having a bridge, a proximal end coupled to the bridge and a distal end coupled to
the bridge. The clip is disposed within the housing such that it retains a resilience

imparting a biasing force to the clip ends such that the ends grip the needle shaft.
When the housing is advanced beyond the needle distal tip, the clip distal end releases

to contain the needle distal tip within the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of medical devices and in particular to a needle
safety cover.Blood borne diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis present significant risks to
medical personnel administering vascular injections. The means by which a patient's
vessel and skin are pierced to either draw or introduce fluids can just as effectively
pierce the hands and arms of attending medical personnel. Gloves or similar protective
garb may provide some protection, but making such items entirely resistant to needle
penetration oftentimes sacrifices the wearer's mobility and dexterity proportionate to
the degree of protection. Therefore, protective wear is not a total answer to the
problem.In order to adequately protect medical personnel from inadvertent puncture and
wounding, catheter systems have been developed to cover and shield the distal needle
point after its withdrawal from the patient. These systems have taken a number of
embodiments and have various degrees of elaboration. One such mechanism includes a
cylindrical sheath of plastic which telescopes out from the flash chamber to surround
the needle shaft, including the distal tip. Such mechanism increases costs of
manufacture substantially and may malfunction, especially in a fluid filled environment
where it may stick or slip. The need for locking parts under these circumstances also
increases risk of failure. Other types of needle caps require moving parts, such as a
spring activation, to close off the needle in the cap after its withdrawal. These
sometimes combine moving parts with specially tooled needles having two or more 
separate widths so that the larger circumference and diameter either trips the spring
and/or blocks the needle's removal from the cap.Given that the needle protector, however configured, will be contaminated upon
each use, cost-benefit requirements dictate that a desirable shielding system be
disposable along with the needle. Furthermore, the system must be quick and easy to
use as to present as little imposition as possible to the administration and function of
the catheter. Moving parts which may malfunction or stick such as springs and similar
biasing mechanisms, as well as telescoping sheaths requiring deployment from the flash
chamber, are less desirable in this regard and can drive up the manufacturing cost for a
disposable unit. Lathing the needle circumference to alter the circumference over
particular segments requires precise tooling and hence substantially added cost. What
is desirable is a low cost, easily

An apparatus comprising:

a housing (20) having a proximal end and a distal end, the housing slidably
mounted on a needle shaft (15) below a needle distal tip (22); and
a clip (11) having a bridge (13), a proximal end (17) coupled to the bridge (13) and
a distal end (16) coupled to the bridge (13), the clip (11) disposed within the housing (20)

such that it retains a resilience imparting a biasing force to the clip ends (16,17) such
that the ends (16,17) grip the needle shaft (15) and when the housing (20) is advanced

beyond the needle distal tip (22), the clip distal end (16) releases to contain the needle
distal tip (22) within the housing (20);

   
characterised in that
:

the clip (11) is a first clip and the apparatus further comprises:

a second clip (12) having a bridge (13), a proximal end (17) coupled to the bridge
(13) and a distal end (16) coupled to the bridge (13), the second clip (12) disposed within

the housing (20) such that it retains a resilience imparting a biasing force to the clip ends
(16,17) such that the ends (16,17) grip the needle shaft (15) and when the housing distal

end is advanced beyond the needle distal tip (22), the second clip distal end (16) releases to
contain the needle distal tip (22) within the housing (20).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the distal end (16) of the first clip (11) and the
distal end (16) of the second clip (12) engage each oth
er upon their release to contain the
needle distal tip (22) within the housing (20).
The apparatus of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the first and second clip ends (16,17)
terminate in tabs (25) which define a semicircular circumference configured to receive the

needle shaft (15).
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the tabs (25) define an eccentric semicircular
circumference having sides of substantially inequivalent lengths. 
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the first clip (11) and the
second clip (12) each further comprise an arched bridge (13) coupled to the distal end (16)

and the proximal end (17).
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the first clip and second
clip proximal ends (17) and distal ends (16) are hinged to the bridge (13) such that the

angle formed by the hinges is less than ninety degrees when the clip proximal end (17) and
distal end (16) engage the needle shaft (15).
The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the proximal ends (17) of the first clip (11) and
second clip (12) engage the needle shaft (15) so as to obstruct advancement of the housing

(20) toward the needle distal tip (22) when the distal ends (16) of the first clip (11) and
second clip (12) release.
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the first and second
clips (11, 12) are fashioned from stainless steel.
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the housing (20) further
defines a window (35) for viewing the needle distal tip (22) when contained within the

housing (20).
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the housing (20) is
barrel shaped.
