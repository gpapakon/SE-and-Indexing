<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for the 
construction of a fiber-optic sensor in which a chromophore 

is fixed on a support and said support is linked to 
at least one optical fiber for the transmission and 

reception of a light signal. According to the invention, 
the end of the optical fiber (F) is heated and brought to 

a softening temperature, and the support (S) is 
immobilized on the optical fiber (F) by partially 

incorporating it in the softened portion of the optical 
fiber and subsequently cooling and solidifying the 

optical fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for constructing 
a fiber-optic sensor, in which a chromophore is fixed 
on a support, and said support is linked to at least one 
optical fiber for the transmission and reception of a 
beam of electromagnetic waves. The invention further relates to a fiber-optic 
sensor comprising at least one optical fiber for transmitting/receiving 
a beam of electromagnetic waves and, 
associated with the end of said optical fiber, a support 
to which a chromophore is applied. In recent times, numerous studies have been 
performed regarding the construction of chemical sensors 
making use of optical fibers. Typically, these sensors 
comprise a system including one or more optical fibers 
for conducting electromagnetic radiation, especially 
within the visible range, with which is associated a 
chromophore, that is to say a substance the electromagnetic 
radiation absorption characteristics of which 
change as a function of the chemical characteristics of 
the environment in which said substance is immersed. 
Sensors of this type are utilized, for example, for 
taking pH readings. Currently, these sensors are constructed in 
accordance with various techniques. One of these techniques 
involves the application of the chromophore to a 
polymeric support which is then inserted into a container 
intended to be applied to the end of the optical fiber. 
The container is expediently slotted or otherwise made 
permeable in order to permit penetration by the liquid on 
which the reading is to be performed, within said  
 
container and thus in contact with the chromophore disposed 
on the polymeric support. According to another 
technique, the chromophore is attached directly to the 
optical fiber rather than to a solid support. This second 
technique offers numerous advantages, including the high 
degree of miniaturization, the extremely compact 
structure, the absence of a probe in which to incorporate 
the external support and which is fixed to the optical 
fiber, and reduced response times. Nevertheless, the 
direct application of the chromophore to the surface of 
the fiber presents the disadvantage of a low sensitivity 
of the sensor thus obtained, due to the modest quantity 
of chromophore which can be immobilized on the fiber. 
Studies have been carried out on various systems for 
increasing the quantity of chromophore immobilized on the 
fibers; among these, it is possible to mention chemical 
treatments of the surface of the fibers to increase the 
number of sites available for the
