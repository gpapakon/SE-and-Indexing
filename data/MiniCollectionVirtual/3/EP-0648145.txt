<ABSTRACT>
A reversible flow filter consists of layered, in particular ring-shaped elements suitable for manufacturing filter candles. In filter candles, a radial current flows outward through the elements during the filtering operation, whereas the direction of flow is reversed during the backwashing operation. On the inner side of the filtering layer, a lip which can be elastically deflected in the direction of flow is arranged on each element, facing the current, and forms a gap together with a fixed edge of the adjacent element. Under the influence of the differential pressure exercised by the current on the broad front surface of the lip, the lip moves so as to narrow the gap in a limited measure. Restoring forces accumulate because of its elastic deformation. When the current is interrupted, specially during the transition from filtering to backwashing operation, the lip returns by itself to its original position, under the influence of the restoring forces, so that the gap is enlarged again and soil attached to the gap is released and easily carried away by the backwashing current, without leaving any residues.
