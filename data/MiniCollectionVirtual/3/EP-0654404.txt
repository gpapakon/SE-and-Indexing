<ABSTRACT>
A fastening for a thermal insulation structure on the airframe of an aircraft, the insulation structure consisting of a large number of panels (6) which are resistant to strong heating, are mechanically robust and, if necessary, are provided with an additional joint seal, having a plurality of fastening points (1, 2, 3) per panel, which fastening points (1, 2, 3) are spaced apart from one another and produce a positively locking connection between the insulation structure and the airframe. The fastening has a first fastening point (1) which does not permit any movement, or permits at most limited rotational movement of the panel (6) about an axis which is at right angles to the airframe surface (5), a second fastening point (2) which permits limited, linear displacement of the panel (6) parallel to the airframe surface (5), and at least one further fastening point (3) which permits limited displacement of the panel (6) in all directions. The first fastening point (1) is designed as a self-locking plug-in and snap-action connection which is detachable from the panel surface and has a connecting bolt (8), a connecting element which holds this bolt, and a spring element which locks these two parts. All the other fastening points are designed as plug-in connections, with the same insertion direction for all the fastening points.

Mounting of a thermal insulation structure to the cell of a flying 
object, in particular a space vehicle with re-entry into the 

atmosphere, and the insulation structure is composed of a 
plurality of high heat resistant, mechanically stable panels, if 

appropriate provided with an additional joint seal, with a plurality 
of mounting points per panel, which are distanced from each 

other and form a positive connection between insulation structure 
and cell, 
characterised by
 a first mounting point (1), which does 
not permit any movement of the panel (6) or an at least defined 

rotary movement of the panel (6) around an axis which is 
perpendicular or virtually perpe
ndicular to the cell surface (5) or 
to a local tangential plane of the cell surface, a second mounting 

point (2) which permits a defined linear displacement of the panel 
(6) parallel or virtually parallel to the cell surface (5), at least one 

further mounting point (3) which permits a defined allsided 
displacement of the panel (6) parallel or virtually parallel to the 

cell surface (5), an embodiment of the first mounting point (1) as 
a plug- or snap-connection, which is selflocking and releasable 

from the panel surface which is loaded by hot gas, with a 
connecting pin (8), with a connecting element (13) which receives 

the latter, and with a spring element (23) which locks these two 
parts rigidly or at least with defined rotary movability, and an 

embodiment of further mounting points (2, 3) as plug 
connections, and the plugging direction is the same for all 

mounting points. 
Mounting according to Claim 1, 
characterised by
 an 
embodiment of the first mounting point (1) with a connecting pin 

(8) which is attached to the cell and comprises a first insertion 
point, and the connecting element (13) comprises a connecting 

bridge (13) which is attached to the panel and which comprises 
at a distance from the panel bottom (7) a guide slot (16) with 

insert phase (18) for the insertion point (10) of the connecting pin 
(8), and furthermore the spring element (23) is a leaf spring (23) 

which is relative to its longitudinal extent bent several times  
 

comprising a bore (24) for receiving the connecting pin (8) as well 
as a rivet pin (25) which is distanced from the bore (24), two 

sections (26, 27) which extend from diametral sides with a ramp-like 
slant toward the bore (24), and a free spring end (28) which 

extends up into the joint area of the panel (6), and the connecting 
bridge (13) comprises a bore (21) for receiving the rivet pin (25) 

of the leaf spring (23) and a matching slot (20) for passing the 
leaf spring (23) through and securing it from rotating. 
Mounting according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised by
 an 
embodiment of the second mounting point (2) with a connecting 

pin (9) which is attached to the cell and comprises an insertion 
point (11), and with a connecting bridge (14) which is attached to 

the panel and which has at a distance from the panel bottom (7) 
a guide slot (17) with insert phase (19) for insertion (11) of the 

connecting pin (9), and by arranging each additional mounting 
point (3) with a connecting latch (12) which is connected to the 

cell and with a connecting bridge (15) which is attached to the 
panel and which comprises a glide surface (22) which makes 

contact with the connecting latch (12). 
Mounting according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, for a thermal 
insulation structure with rectangular, in particular square or 

rhombic panels, 
characterised by
 four mounting points per 
panel, by an arrangement of the first and the second mounting 

point in the area of two diametral corners of the panel, by an 
arrangement of the two additional mounting points in the area of 

the remaining diametral corners of the panel, and by an insert 
direction of all four mounting points which is parallel or virtually 

parallel relative to the panel diagonal which connects the first and 
the second mounting point.
