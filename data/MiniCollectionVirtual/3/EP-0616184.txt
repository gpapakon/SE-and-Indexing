<ABSTRACT>
Packed bed device with gas treatment, especially cooler, comprising a push grating (1) with at least one grating element (3) which is moved to and fro in the conveying direction and to which the gas can be supplied from a stationary source (15) via a pipeline (6, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18) which comprises, inside a substantially closed grating underlying space (20) subjected to overpressure, a compensator (16) for taking up the relative movement between the stationary source and the grating element. The compensator (16) is formed by parts (17, 18) which are telescopically displaceable one inside the other. The structure of the compensator can be simple and insensitive, since leakage losses are permissible in view of the maintenance of the overpressure in the grating underlying space.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for treating a bed of bulk material
with a gas, in particular a cooler for combustion

material, which comprises a sliding grate (1) with at
least one grate element (3) which can reciprocate in the

conveying direction, to which the gas can be fed from a
stationary source (15) via a pipe system (6,7,8,13,17,18),

which comprises inside a lower substantially closed grate
chamber (20), on which an overpressure acts, a compensator

(16) for accommodating the relative movement between the
stationary source and the grate element, characterised in

that the compensator (16) is formed by parts (17,18) which
can slide telescopically into one another and the leak

rate of which is adjusted to the gas demand for
maintaining the overpressure in the lower grate chamber.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the compensator (16) is disposed parallel to the

movement direction (4) of the grate element.
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the leak rate of the compensator

(16) is lower than the gas demand for maintaining the
overpressure in the lower grate chamber (20) and an

additional gas supply is provided.
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the leak rate of the compensator

(16) is greater than the gas demand for maintaining the 
overpressure in the lower grate chamber (20) and an

overpressure relief device is provided.
An apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that a plurality of movable grate

elements (3) is disposed on a carrier (8) guided in the
movement direction and the movable part (17) of the

compensator (16) is retained by this carrier.
An apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised in
that the carrier comprises a gas-conveying swinging frame

(8) extending in the longitudinal direction of the grate.
An apparatus according to Claim 6, characterised in
that gas-conveying grate carriers (6) extending

transversely to the longitudinal direction of the grate
are mounted on the swinging frame (8), the connection (7)

of which with the swinging frame (8) is designed to be
gas-conveying.
An apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the swinging frame (8) comprises a

plurality of gas-conveying chambers separated from one
another and each connected via a compensator (16) to the

source (15), which chambers are associated with different
grate element sections (43,44).
An apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that a plurality of swinging frames (8)

associated with different grate element sections (43) are
arranged side-by-side and/or in series.
An apparatus according to Claim 8 or 9,
characterised in that the gas supply to swinging frames or 

gas-supply portions of a swinging frame, which are
associated with different grate element sections, can be

variably adjusted.
An apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the gas supply from a swinging frame

to a grate carrier is adjustable.
An apparatus according to Claim 7, characterised in
that a gas-conveying bearing block (7) is disposed between

the swinging frame (8) and the grate carrier (6).
An apparatus according to Claim 11 and 12,
characterised in that the bearing block (7) contains an

adjustable member (45).
An apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that between the tubular parts (17,18) of

the compensator (16) engaging telescopically into one
another is a clearance (19) at least corresponding to the

possible relative change in position of the swinging frame
(8) with respect to the stationary parts (15) transversely

to the movement direction.
An apparatus according to any one of Claim 14,
characterised in that the compensator (16) is provided

with sealing elements (32,35) which are mounted floating
on one compensator part (17) transversely to the

longitudinal direction of the compensator and which co-operate
slidingly with the other compensator part (18).
An apparatus according to Claim 14 or 15,
characterised in that the compensator is provided with

resilient sealing elements (25). 
An apparatus according to Claim 16, characterised in
that the periphery of at least one compensator part (18)

is defined polygonally, in particular rectangularly, and
separate straight sealing rails (25) co-operate with each

polygon side.
