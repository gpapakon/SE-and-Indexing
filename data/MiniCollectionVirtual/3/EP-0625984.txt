<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel β-lactam containing compounds, their
preparation and their use, and in particular to a novel class of
cephalosporins. These compounds have antibacterial properties, and are
therefore of use in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and
animals caused by a wide range of organisms.European Patent Application No. 0 392 796 discloses a 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(hydroxyimino)acetamido]-3-(1,3-dithiolan-2-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid derivative of
the following formula:

or a salt thereof, wherein A represents a hydrogen atom, a 1-acetoxyethyl group, a 1-cyclohexylacetoxyethyl
group or a pivaloyloxymethyl group. These compounds are
effective antimicrobial agents suitable for oral administration.European Patent Application No. 0 395 219 discloses β-lactam compounds of the
following formula:

including pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hyrolisable esters, wherein
R1 is hydrogen, methoxy or formamido;R2 is an acyl group, in particular that of an antibacterially active cephalosporin;CO2R6 is a carboxy group or carboxylate anion;R3 is a γ-lactone ring optionally containing an endocyclic double bond, which ring is
optionally substituted at any carbon atom by alkyl, dialkylamino, alkoxy, hydroxy,
halogen or aryl, which in the case of more than one substituent may be the same or
different, or is optionally di-substituted at two adjacent carbon atoms, which are available
for substitution, to form an aromatic fused bicyclic system, andX is as, SO, SO2, O or CH2.We have found a particular class of cephalosporins bearing a cyclic thio-ether
substituent at the 3-position of the cephalosporin nucleus that
possesses prolonged and high levels of antibacterial activity, and shows
good absorption both parentally and orally, especially orally.The present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof:
