<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an improved system for masking 
the free edge of a window gasket in preparation for re-painting 

or re-finishing a vehicle. 
The system includes a method of painting a vehicle 
which comprises introducing a flexible plastics strip (10) 

beneath a window sealing gasket (12) in the vicinity of a part 
of the vehicle (13) to be painted, the plastics strips (10) having 

a tapered profile in cross-section so that as the strip is 
pressed beneath the gasket (12), the latter (12) is lifted and held 

in the raised position, masking the edge (16) of the raised 
gasket (12) and applying paint to the vehicle (13) so that paint 

reaches the area normally covered by the edge (16) of the 
gasket (12). 
Generally, the strip (12) is a plasticised polymer in the 
form of a triangular cross-section having one side (14) longer 

than the other two (15,18). An applicator is also described 
which comprises a handle and a pointed end for lifting the 

free edge (16) of a window sealing gasket (12), the applicator 
having a recess or aperture adjacent to the pointed end, 

said recess or aperture being shaped to correspond 
approximately with the cross-section of the flexible, 

plastics strip (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of masking sealing 
gaskets. More especially, but not exclusively, the 
invention relates to a method of masking window sealing 
gaskets, for example, in the course of painting or 
refinishing a vehicle. The windows of vehicles, particularly road vehicles, 
are frequently held in place in the vehicle frame using 
rubber or plastics window sealing gaskets and which are 
sometimes known as sealing rubbers. The free edge of the 
sealing gasket commonly rests on a painted surface and 
when the vehicle requires to be painted or refinished, 
e.g. after an accident, it is difficult and time consuming 
to accurately place a masking strip along the edge of the 
window gasket. Commonly, the net result is that the 
paint either does not reach up to the edge of the gasket 
or, more often the gasket is coated at its edge with paint 
which needs to be cleaned off as a final step. Swedish Patent Application No. 440982 describes a 
system for lifting window gaskets in which a round section 
strip is pressed under the gasket by feeding the strip 
through an applicator having a tubular guide. This 
system has not been successful in practice and there have 
been difficulties in accurately placing the strips beneath 
the gasket and also in the strip becoming misplaced or  
 
misaligned during the re-painting or re-finishing 
operation. The present invention is concerned with the provision 
of an improved system for lifting the edge of a gasket 
including an improved design of lifting strip and a more 
reliable and convenient method for feeding a flexible 
plastic strip beneath the gasket. According to one aspect of the present invention is 
provided a method of painting a vehicle which comprises 
introducing a flexible plastics strip beneath a window 
sealing gasket in the vicinity of a part of the vehicle to 
be painted, the plastics strip having a tapered profile in 
cross-section so that as the strip is pressed beneath the 
gasket, the latter is lifted and held in the raised 
position, masking the edge of the raised gasket and 
applying paint to the vehicle so that paint reaches the 
area normally covered by the edge of the gasket. The invention also provides a method of painting an 
object having a resilient gasket which comprises 
introducing a flexible plastics strip beneath the gasket, 
the plastics strip having a tapered profile in cross-section 
so that as the strip is pressed beneath the 
gasket, the gasket is lifted and held in a raised 
position, masking the edge of the raised
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A plastics strip for use in painting an object 
having a resilient gasket wherein the plastics strip is 

introduced beneath the gasket, said strip comprising a 
length of flexible plastics material having a uniform, 

triangular cross-section whose sides are of unequal 
length, the largest side being intended to contact the 

inner face of the gasket. 
A plastics strip according to claim 1 which 
includes a flange portion forming a recess for 

accommodating the free edge of the gasket in use. 
A plastics strip according to claim 1 or 2 which 
is formed from plasticised pvc. 
An applicator for use in introducing a plastics 
strip beneath a resilient sealing gasket, comprising a 

handle and a pointed end for lifting the free edge of the 
sealing gasket, the applicator having a recess or aperture 

adjacent to the pointed end, said recess or aperture being 
shaped to correspond approximately with the cross-section 

of the flexible, plastics strip.
