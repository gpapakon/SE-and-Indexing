<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for eliminating vortex whistle noise in a 
radial-to-axial compressor intake uses a plurality of vortex-disturbing 

tabs (110) 
mounted to the trailing edges of inlet guide vanes (84) and extending 

into the 
flow path between adjacent vanes. The tabs (110) are mounted to the 

guide 
vane (84) so that the tab (110) is always perpendicular to the guide 

vane (84), regardless 
of the vanes angular position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to noise-attenuating devices, and 
more particularly to a novel apparatus and methods for silencing vortex 
"whistle" noises generated within the radial-to-axial intake section of the 
load compressor of a gas turbine engine auxiliary power unit. In addition to their traditional propulsion functions, gas turbine 
engines are also used aboard aircraft as auxiliary power units (APU) to 
supply pneumatic power to a wide variety of accessory devices and 
systems. This is accomplished by bleeding a desired quantity of 
compressed air from a centrifugal "load" compressor which is connected 
to and driven by the engine's drive shaft. Ambient air is drawn axially into the load compressor through the 
annular flow passage of an intake assembly which has a circular, radially 
outwardly facing inlet opening that circumscribes the drive shaft. 
Adjustable inlet guide vanes are mounted in a mutually spaced 
relationship around the circumference of the radial inlet opening for 
conjoint pivotal motion about axes parallel to the shaft axis between a 
fully closed position, in which the vanes are each generally tangentially 
disposed relative to their inlet opening, and a fully open position in which 
each of the vanes extends generally radially inwardly therefrom. By 
selectively adjusting the angular position of these vanes the flow rate of air 
entering the load compressor (and thus the flow rate of compressed air 
supplied to the pneumatically-operated accessory apparatus) during 
engine operation may be accurately regulated. Because of their orientation relative to the drive shaft axis, the inlet 
guide vanes, within a certain range of opening angles, impart to air 
traversing the intake assembly flow passage a desirable vortex pattern in 
which the air swirls about the shaft axis as it is drawn axially into the load 
compressor. This vortex pattern causes the air therein to contact the 
curved impeller blades of the centrifugal load compressor at an efficient 
angle of incidence.  
 However, in conventional radial-to-axial air intake assembles of the 
type described, the induced air swirl also creates, at certain inlet guide 
vane angles, a shrill intake noise known as vortex whistle or the Ranque-Hilsch 
effect. Vortex whistle is undesirable from two standpoints. First, it is 
often unacceptable under applicable acoustic standards. Second, 
generation of the whistle within the intake assembly causes an 
aerodynamic energy loss which diminishes the efficiency of the load 
compresso
