<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle bonnet assembly includes a bonnet (30) hinged to the vehicle 
body adjacent a leading edge (31) and having releasable catch means (47) 

adjacent a trailing edge (41), the bonnet (30) being hinged to the vehicle 
body in a manner which will permit re
arward movement of the bonnet 
(30) when an impact is applied to the leading edge (31) thereof, a lifting 

mechanism (40, 42) being provided to lift the trailing edge (41) of the 
bonnet (30) in response to rearward movement of the bonnet (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicle bonnets and in particular bonnets
for motor cars.In modern motor car design, for visibility, aerodynamic and styling
reasons, it is desirable that the bonnet line is kept as low as possible. As
a result, there is generally very little clearance between the bonnet and
the engine bay contents of the motor car. Consequently, the bonnet will
provide very little cushioning effect when impacted by a pedestrian during
an accident.It has been proposed to permit rearward movement of the bonnet when
an impact load is applied thereto, means being provided whereby said
rearward movement will lift the bonnet increasing the clearance between
the bonnet and the engine bay contents and improving the cushioning
effect. Hitherto this has been achieved by the use of suitable hinge
mechanisms, as disclosed in DE-A-2711339 and JP-A-58211975.However, as such hinge mechanisms must permit normal opening and
closing of the bonnet to provide access to the engine bay the hinge
mechanisms used hitherto have, of necessity, been of complex design. Furthermore, with the arrangement disclosed in DE-A-2711339, the front
edge of the bonnet must extend beyond the radiator grille, otherwise the
pedestrian will impact the radiator grille and will be catapulted onto the
bonnet without displacing the bonnet rearwardly. This places restraints
on the design of the vehicle. With the invention covered by the present
application, the bonnet will be moved rearwardly whether the pedestrian
impacts the modular front end assembly or the leading edge of the
bonnet. There will consequently be no restraints on the design of the
vehicle in this respect.The system covered by the present application will also be effective in
cushioning impacts with small children or in circumstances where the
pedestrian is impacted by the front end of the assembly rather than the
leading edge of the bonnet. The present invention provides a bonnet assembly which will provide
pedestrian protection and which utilises simple hinge mechanisms of
conventional design.According to one aspect of the present invention, a vehicle bonnet
assembly includes a bonnet, said bonnet being hinged adjacent its leading
edge to a modular front end assembly of the vehicle for pivotal movement
about a first transverse axis of the vehicle, characterised in that the front
end assembly is hinged to the vehicle for pivotal movement about a 
second transverse axis of the vehicle, the first transverse axis being
spaced above the second transverse axis, so that

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle bonnet assembly including a bonnet (30), the bonnet (30)
being hinged adjacent its leading edge (31) to a modular front end

assembly (32) of the vehicle for pivotal movement about a first transverse
axis of the vehicle, characterised in that the front end assembly (32) is

hinged to the vehicle for pivotal movement about a second transverse
axis of the vehicle, first transverse axis being spaced above the second

transverse axis, so that the front end assembly (32) is capable of pivoting
rearwardly in response to an impact load being applied to the leading

edge (31) of the bonnet (30), pivoting of the front end assembly (32)
causing the bonnet (30) to move rearwardly, means (40, 42) being

provided adjacent the trailing edge (41) of the bonnet (30) to cause the
trailing edge (41) of the bonnet (30) to move upwardly upon rearward

movement of the bonnet (30). 
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in
that shear pins (35) are provided between the front end assembly (32)

and a structural element of the vehicle to prevent rearward pivoting of the
front end assembly (32) until the impact load applied to the leading edge

(31) of the bonnet (30) exceeds a predetermined value.
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in
that torque limiting means are provided on the hinge connection between

the front end assembly (32) and the vehicle, to prevent rearward pivoting
of the front end assembly (32) until the impact load applied to the leading

edge (31) of the bonnet (30) exceeds a predetermined value.
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that a pair of rollers (40) are provided one on

either side of the bonnet (30) adjacent the trailing edge (41) of the bonnet
(30), tracks (42) being provided on the vehicle body for engagement by 

the rollers (40), the tracks (42) being inclined upwardly from the leading
end (46) to the trailing end thereof.
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 4 characterised in
that catch mechanisms (47) are provided adjacent the leading ends (46)

of the tracks (42) for engagement of the rollers (40), when the bonnet
(30) is in its normally closed position, means being provided to release the

catch mechanisms (47) to permit the bonnet (30) to be pivoted to an
open position.
