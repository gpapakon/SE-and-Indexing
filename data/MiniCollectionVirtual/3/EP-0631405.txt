<ABSTRACT>
The loop comprises a tunable source (46) in the network headend (40) emitting a multi-coloured sequence (L1, L2, L3, L4). In each local area (Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4), a coupler (C1) picks up the part of the sequence at the wavelength of the area, and means (F1, D1, CT1) recover the data intended for the area. A source (S1) makes it possible to insert data originating from the area into the multi-coloured sequence at the location of the data extracted. Application to optical telecommunications.
