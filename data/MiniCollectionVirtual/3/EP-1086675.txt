<ABSTRACT>
The compression hose (2) of elastic textile base material where a rhombic grid (6) with helically oriented strips (7, 8) is integrated into the base material whose elasticity is lower than the elasticity of the strips. As a result, the compression producible by the hose is variable by stretching or contacting the hose in its longitudinal direction.

<CLAIMS>
Compression sleeve (2) made of elastic base material for the treatment of leg complaints, 
characterised in that
 a rhombic lattice (6) consisting of several rhombuses on each side of the leg in the circumferential direction is integrated into the base material, with diagonals (12) of the rhombuses (10) lying in the longitudinal direction of the sleeve and with intersecting elastic strips (7, 8) extending helically and continuously obliquely relative to the longitudinal direction of the sleeve and forming the rhombic lattice (6), the elasticity of these strips being lower than that of the base material enclosed by the strips (7, 8), in such a manner that the length of the sleeve (2) resulting from longitudinal stretching of the sleeve (2) determines the compression thereof.
Compression sleeve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rhombic lattice (6) is knitted into the base material.
Compression sleeve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rhombic lattice (6) is stuck on.
Compression sleeve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rhombic lattice (6) is welded on.
Compression sleeve according to claim 3 or claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the rhombic lattice (6) consists of an elastic film material.
Compression sleeve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rhombic lattice (6) is formed by local welding or bonding of the base material in the region of the strips.
Compression sleeve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rhombic lattice (6) is applied to the base material in the form of liquefied plastic and is hardened after application.
Compression sleeve according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 it ends in a foot part (3).
