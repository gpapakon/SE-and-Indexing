<ABSTRACT>
A shifting apparatus for a bicycle includes a takeup element (14) 
for winding a 

control cable, a shift lever (11,12) for engaging and rotating the takeup 
element, PTO 

means operable with rotation of the takeup element, and a shifter case 
(13) for 

rotatably supporting the takeup element. The shifter case 
includes a mounting 

portion (2a) for connecting the shifter case to a handlebar (1) of the 
bicycle, a coupling 

section (17), and a speed indicator mounted on the coupling section. 
The speed 

indicator (20) has a movable member operatively connected to the PTO 
means for 

indicating a selected speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shifting apparatus for a bicycle 
according to the preamble of the main claim. Conventional shifting apparatus or devices 
for bicycles may be classified into the type 
having a speed indicator and the type having no speed indicator. The shifting 
device with a speed indicator includes a shifter case having a relatively large 
capacity to accommodate movable elements of the speed indicator as well as 
the takeup element. The shifting device without a speed indicator includes a 
shifter case having a relatively small capacity to accommodate only a shifting 
mechanism including the takeup element. Thus, the two types of shifting devices 
are manufactured by separately preparing components designed specially for 
the shifting device with the speed indicator, and those designed specially for the 
shifting device without. The shifter case for the shifting device without the speed indicator is smaller 
than the shifter case for the shifting device with the speed indicator, but still is 
itself a large component of the shifting device. Thus, two types of relatively 
large dies are required to form separately the shifter case for the shifting device 
with the speed indicator and the shifter case for the shifting device without the 
speed indicator. This results in high cost of the shifting devices.  
 Further a shifting apparatus according to the preamble of the 
main claim is known (US-A-3 633 437). It comprises a takeup 
element for winding up a control cable a shift lever for 
engaging and rotating said takeup element. Further it is 
comprised with a speed indicator which includes a moveable 
element for moving relative to said indicator case in response 
to a rotation the takeup element. Further there are means for 
transmitting the rotation of said takeup element to said 
moveable element. Additionally, takeup elements are supported 
in a shifter case which allows the rotation of the takeup 
element. The present invention intends to provide a shifting apparatus for a bicycle 
having a relatively inexpensive construction to be usable as tile type with a 
speed indicator and as the type without one. The above object is fulfilled, according to the present invention, by a shifting 
apparatus for a bicycle as noted in the main claim. According to the invention, the speed indicator is manufactured independently 
of the shifting device, and assembled thereto by connecting the speed indicator 
to the coupling section so that a torque is transmitted from the takeup element 
through

<CLAIMS>
A shifting apparatus for a bicycle comprising 

a takeup element (14) for winding a control cable (5); 
a shift lever (11, 12) for engaging and rotating said 
takeup element (14); 
a speed indicator (20), including an indicator case (21), and 
a movable element (22) 

for moving relative to said indicator case (21) in response to 
a rotation of the takeup element (14); 
means for transmitting a rotation of said takeup element 
(14) to said movable element (22); 
a shifter case (13) for rotatably supporting said takeup 
element (14), 
characterized
 in that
 
said shifter case (13) has a coupling surface 

(17) for externally mounting said speed indicator (20) thereon 

and in that there is comprised mounting means (25) for 
detachtably mounting said indicator case (21) to said shifter 

case (13).

characterized in that said speed indicator (20) includes a 

fixed scale panel, and in that said movable element (22) is a 
pointer being movable along said scale panel. 
A shifting apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that said speed indicator (20) includes a 

fixed pointer, and a scale panel movable relative to said 
pointer.  

 
A shifting apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that said means for transmitting a rotation 

of said takeup element (14) 
includes a projection (23b) engageable with said takeup 

element (14). 
A shifting apparatus as defined in claim 1, characterized in that said indicator 
further including a support (24) and that said movable element (22) is disposed 

between said indicator case (21) and said support (24) and is rotatable about a first 
axis with a rotation of said takeup element (14).
