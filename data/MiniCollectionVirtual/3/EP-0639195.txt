<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new cephalosporins,
their preparation and to pharmaceutical and veterinary
compositions containing them.The compounds disclosed in the present invention are
cephem sulphones or sulphoxides featuring the simultaneous
presence on the cephem skeleton of an acyl group at C-4 and
an acyloxy group at C-2.FR-A-2020063 describes 2-acyloxy-4-carboxy-7-aminoprotected
cephems having antibiotic activity.WO91/09036 provides cephems with an acyl group at C-4 and a-S(O)n-linking
group at C2 which are endowed with inhibitory activity on
elastases.EP-A-0337704 discloses 4-acyl cephems without substituent at
the C-2 position with elastase inhibitory activity.According to the invention there are provided cephalosporin
