<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus is provided which
can selectively drive a plurality of developing rollers

(32, 33; 34, 35) by a simple structure accommodated in a
small space. Two image stations (14, 24) are arranged

along a direction of movement of an intermediate
transfer belt. Each of the image stations is provided

with the plurality of developing units arranged around a
photosensitive drum (16, 26). A developing unit driving

system (63) drives the plurality of developing units. A
switching mechanism (68) switches a transmission path of

a power generated by the developing unit driving system
so that the power is selectively transmitted to one of

the developing units.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an image forming apparatus and, more particularly, to an image forming apparatus having a plurality of developing units selectively operated to develop, for example, different color component images.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.64-971 discloses a technique for selectively driving a plurality of developing units by using a single drive power source. A power generated by the drive power source is transmitted to each of the developing units via a train of gears and a clutch provided to each of the developing units. Accordingly, one of the developing units can be selectively operated by operating the clutch.According to this technique, since a power of the drive power source is transmitted to each clutch, a complex train of gears is needed and a space for accommodating the gears is needed. Accordingly, this technique is not appropriate for reducing size of an image forming apparatus using this technique.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.4-280273 discloses a mechanism for selectively operating one of a plurality of developing units. This mechanism includes a drive gear which is driven by a single drive power source and four shift gears connected to respective developing units. Each of the shift gears is disengageably engaged with the drive gear by means of a pressing cam so that the shift gears are selectively engaged with the drive gear.According to the above-mentioned mechanism, since the four shift gears are selectively engaged with the drive gear, a complex mechanism is needed for operating the pressing cam.Additionally, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications No.5-249833, No.5-216337. No.8-179621 and No.5-333701 disclose developing apparatuses having a plurality of developing rollers such as a first developing roller for developing a latent image on a photosensitive drum by a first component color and a second developing roller for developing a latent image by a second component color. In these apparatuses, when a developing operation is switched from one of the developing rollers to another one of the developing rollers, a bristle cutting operation is performed by reversing the developing roller after the developing operation by the one of the developing units is completed.However, the above-mentioned patent documents do not refer to a mechanism for driving each of the developing rollers. If each of the developing rollers has an individual drive power source, the size of the developing apparatuses is increased which results in an increase in
