<ABSTRACT>
In freely pivotable castor wheels (16) for agricultural working machines, in view of the restricted installation space the object to be achieved is to design the wheel suspension in such a way that it does not project beyond the outside diameter of the running wheel (16). For this purpose, it is proposed to arrange the axis of rotation (12) of the castor wheel (16) at an inclination to the ground in such a way that its imaginary prolongation pierces the ground approximately in the mid-plane of the running wheel (16) and, as seen in the direction of travel, in front of the contact point of the running wheel (16).

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement of freely pivotable castor wheels for
agricultural implements, in particular rotary hay tedders,

having a pivot axis (11) which is inclined relative to the
ground and a substantially horizontal wheel axis (15), whereby

the material pivot axis (10, 12, 13, 14, 10', 18) does not
project at any point beyond the outside diameter of the wheels

(16), the notional prolongation of the pivot axis (11) passes
through the ground approximately in the central plane of the

wheels (16) and, viewed in the direction of travel, in front
of the ground-contacting point of the wheels (16), and two

castor wheels (16) are arranged on a double-armed swing axle
(8) at a spacing relative to each other in the direction of

travel, wherein the inclinations y, y' of the pivot axes (11)
of both castor wheels (16) are in mirror image relationship

with each other as viewed in the direction of travel.
An arrangement according to claim 1 
characterised in that

the inclination y, y' of the pivot axes (11) relative to the
central plane of the wheels (16) is about 15Â°.
