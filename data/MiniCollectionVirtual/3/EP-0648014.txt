<ABSTRACT>
The vibrating plate of invented crystal oscillator, comprised of a 
rim part, vibrating part surrounded by said rim part with a slit 

in-between, and a relatively narrow connecting part connecting said 
vibrating part and said rim part, all of which are made of a same 

material. 
Since the relative position of said vibrating part is fixed to said 
rim part, said vibrating part can never be contacted with said rim part. 

Furthermore, thicknesses of said vibrating and said connecting part are 
respectively less than the thickness of rim part, said vibrating part 

can never be contacted with the casings encasing said vibrating plates. 
Furthermore, since said vibrating plate is provided with surface 
electrodes and said connecting part is provided with electrical leads 

which are extensions of said electrodes, and said vibrating plate is 
encased in a upper and lower casings respectively provided with a 

through-hole at a position facing to said electrical lead. 
A cup-shaped metal lead is fixed in the through-hole, and the bottom 
of the cup is fixed on the electrical lead facing to the through-hole, 

and the metal and electrical leads are electrically connected in this 
case. The metal lead is fabricated by depositing metal particles on the 

throguh-hole using either an evaporation or supputering method. 
The current to the electrodes of vibrating part is supplied through the 

metal leads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a crystal oscillator as set forth in the preamble of
claim 1. An oscillator is state of the art in accordance
with Art. 54.3 EPC in view of EP-A-0 593 070.Fig. 6 shows a perspective view of another conventional crystal oscillator
showing its construction, and Fig. 7 shows a cross-section thereof.Fig. 6 shows the vibrating plate 2 of the crystal oscillator sandwiched
between the upper and lower electrodes 3, housed in a recess of a lower
casing 1. On the other hand, an upper casing 4 is bonded on the upper
surface of lower casing 1 sealing said vibrating plate 2 housed in said
recess.By means of conductive adhesive layers 5A and 5B coated on the right
edges of vibrating plate 2, said vibrating plate 2 is fixed within said
recess. Because of small dimensions of vibrating plate 2, the processes
to fix vibrating plate 2 of the crystal oscillator at an exact position
within said recess have to be executed manually under an extreme care.However, because of the difficulties involved in said manual
processes, vibrating plate 2 may be fixed irregularly within said recess 
causing an unstable oscillation of vibrating plate 2 if it is contacted
with lower casing 1 or upper casing 4.As shown in Fig. 7, the electrical contacts between the upper
electrode 3 of vibrating plate 2 and the right-side electrical terminal
1A of lower casing 1 are obtained by a conductive adhesive layer 5A, and
the electrical contacts between the lower electrode of vibrating plate 2
and the left-side electric terminal 1B of lower casing 1 are obtained
by a conductive adhesive layer 5B. Since these electric terminals 1A and
1B are formed in a complicatedly bent form continuous from the recess
to the external side surface of lower casing 1, the fabrication of these
terminals is by no means simple.The crystal oscillator of EP-A-0 593 070 above has an improved
mechanical construction eliminating the possibilities of contacts
between the vibrating plate and the other components of crystal
oscillator completely, in that the
vibrating plate is comprised of
a rim part, a vibrating part surrounded by said rim part with a fine slit
in-between, and a relatively narrow connecting part connecting said
vibrating part to said rim part, and these three parts are made as one
body by the same material.Therefore, the relative position of said vibrating part to said rim
part is permanently fixed, and no contact of the vibrating part and the
rim part is possible. Furthermore, the vibrating part is provided with an electrode on
both sides
