<ABSTRACT>
A copolymer emulsion contains copolymer particles 
comprising styrene and butyl acrylate units together with 

a colloidal copolymer solution comprising acrylamido 
glycollic acid units, acrylamide units and hydroxyethyl 

acrylate units. The copolymer emulsion is usable for 
producing polymer films with low deformation at high 

temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to copolymer emulsions usable for the
production of polymer films which exhibit low deformation at
elevated temperature.Polymer films based on styrene-butyl acrylate copolymers
prove to present a high deformation at high temperature.
Such a behaviour can be particularly detrimental when these
copolymers are used in roofing felt binders, car mouldings
or as glass fibre coatings.Thus, there is a need for a cross-linking agent which
reduces the deformation at elevated temperature, i.e.
above 100°C.In other respects, the formaldehyde content of copolymer
emulsions is now a major concern and it is thus required 
that the cross-linking reaction produces as little as
possible of formaldehyde.It is therefore a first goal of the present invention to
provide a copolymer emulsion as above described with a
cross-linking agent which allows a low deformation at
elevated temperature while limiting the release of
formaldehyde.It is a first object of the present invention to provide a
copolymer emulsion containing
i) copolymer particles comprising from 15% to 55%
by weight (based on the total monomer units
weight of copolymer particles) of styrene units,
from 15% to 55% by weight (based on the total
monomer units weight of copolymer particles) of
butyl acrylate units and up to 12% by weight
(based on total monomer units weight of
copolymer particles) of methacrylic acid units,
methyl methacrylate units, glycidyl methacrylate
units, hydroxyethyl acrylate units, n-methylol
acrylamide units, andii) from 2% to 15% by weight (based on total monomer
units weight of copolymer particles) of a
colloidal copolymer solution comprising from 20%
to 60% by weight (based on the total weight
monomer units of the colloidal copolymer
solution) of acrylamido glycollic acid units,
20% to 80% by weight (based on the total weight
of monomer units of the colloidal copolymer
solution) of acrylamide units, and up to 40% by 
weight (based on the total weight of the monomer
units of the colloidal copolymer solution) of
hydroxyethyl acrylate units and acrylic acid
units.It is a second object of the present invention to provide
a process for the production a copolymer emulsion wherein
a monomer combination,
   comprising from 15% to 55% by weight (based on the
total monomer weight of said monomer combination) of
styrene, from 15% to 55% by weight (based on total
