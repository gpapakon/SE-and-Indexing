<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a transfer
device and, more particularly, to a magnetic transfer
device well suited for the handling of a minute electronic
component part.Semiconductor laser devices are generally formed by dicing
a laser bar into individual laser elements. The quality
of the individual laser elements is dependent upon the
integrity of the facet sides of the laser bar being diced.
In general, laser bars are cleaved from a laser cell. An
example of a material used in the manufacture of laser
devices is GaAs. GaAs, which has a cuboidal crystal
structure, is very brittle however. Thus, cleaving of GaAs
laser bars is a key factor in the manufacture of GaAs
laser devices.An apparatus for producing high quality laser bars is a
jaw cleaving device disclosed in commonly assigned U.S.
patent 5,154,333. With reference now to Fig. 1, the jaw
cleaving device (not shown) cleaves a laser bar 10 from a
cell 12 according to the following. To begin, the cell 12
is mounted in the cleaving device. A first jaw 14 is then
applied to a margin area 16 at one end of the laser bar 10
from which a cleavage 18 is to be propagated. A second
jaw 20 is applied to a margin area 22 at an opposite end
of the laser bar 10, the second jaw 20 further being
provided with a weight 24 used as a biasing force to
ensure separation of the laser bar 10 from the cell 12
along the same crystallographic plane 26. The cleaving
device exerts a rotational force R upon the cell 12 to
effectuate the cleaving of laser bar 10. Upon separation
of the laser bar 10 from the cell 12, the laser bar 10 is
ready 
for further processing. The laser bar 10 thus produced is of high
quality and has facet sides 28 of high integrity.The integrity of the facet sides 28 of the laser bar 10 must be
maintained to avoid defects in subsequently formed laser devices.
Defects in the facet side of a laser device, which can include a
chipped or shingled surface, cause undesired dispersement of light
by reflections, thereby lowering a total amount of useful light
emanating from the laser. In addition, reflected light at a
shingled surface causes heat generation which can lead to
catastrophic optical damage. That is, portions of the laser's
facet surface can break off due to heat damage. The integrity of
the facet sides of the laser bar is thus very important in order to
subsequently produce a high quality laser device free of defects.In addition to producing cleaved laser bars having high quality
facet sides, it is highly desirable to perform the
