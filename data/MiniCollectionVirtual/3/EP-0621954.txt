<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for monitoring characteristics of rock cores, the apparatus comprising a clad permanent magnet (5) for generating a magnetic field within a working volume (101) which is sufficiently uniform to enable an NMR experiment to be performed. Conveyors (2) convey rock cores (3) along a path about which the magnet (5) is arranged. The cores pass through the working volume (101) of the magnetic field. A control system (100) carries out an NMR experiment on the portion of the rock core in the working volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus for determining
characteristics of rock cores, for example to allow
assessment of oil bearing rock characteristics.It is well known that oil bearing rock characteristics
such as porosity can be monitored by making use of nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Conventionally, test
samples of rock cores from the well head are extracted and
then sent to a remote laboratory for analysis. However,
this is time consuming and there is a risk of damage to the
rock core before it is analysed. Consequently, it has been
proposed to carry out NMR analysis on rock cores at the
well site. An example of apparatus of this type is
described in US-A-4885540. In this case, rock core samples
are placed in individual troughs and fed by conveying
rollers between the poles of an electromagnet and through
a rf coil. The coil is pulsed in a conventional manner and
used as a receiving coil to perform various conventional
NMR analyses on the rock core samples.A number of problems arise with this known approach.
One particular problem is that large fringe fields are
generated by the magnet which is particularly undesirable
when the apparatus is being used at the well head site.
In this situation, there will tend to be large bodies of
iron close to the equipment which experience the fringe
field and as a result significantly reduce the uniformity
of the field in the working region while there will also be
sensitive instrumentation nearby which is affected by the
fringe field.Another problem which arises with the conventional
approach is that the NMR analysis is carried out on the
full cross-section of the rock cores which can lead to
erroneous results due to the likelihood of damage to the
surface areas.In accordance with the present invention, apparatus
for monitoring characteristics of rock cores comprises 
means for generating a magnetic field within a working
volume which is sufficiently uniform to enable a NMR
experiment to be performed; means for conveying rock cores
along a path about which the magnetic field generating
means is arranged, the cores passing through the working
volume of the magnetic field; and means for carrying out a
NMR experiment on the portion of the rock core in the
working volume and is characterised in that the magnetic
field generating means comprises a clad permanent magnet;
in that the magnet generates a magnetic field defining a
saddle profile, the working volume being located about a
minium of the saddle profile; and in that the conveying
means conveys rock
