<ABSTRACT>
An RF signal is rapidly brought to a high power level prior 
to the introduction of a wafer (14) into the reaction 

chamber (10) to initiate a plasma that agitates and 
circulates any particles (31) within the reaction chamber 

(10), thereby allowing effective reaction chamber cleaning; 
and an RF signal is slowly brought to a high power level to 

initiate a plasma prior to or during wafer processing to 
avoid disturbing and circulating such particles (31) during 

wafer processing, thereby preventing particle induced 
contamination. A magnetic field may be applied to the 

reaction chamber (10) by magnets (30a, 30b) to move 
particles (31) from a plasma sheath/glow region interface 

(37) to a reaction chamber exhaust line (36), and thereby 
prevent such particles from falling onto a processed wafer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the control of particle generation during the 
fabrication of integrated circuits. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to preventing particle contamination of integrated circuits during plasma 
processing within a reaction chamber. A plasma is often used during the fabrication of integrated circuits in a reaction 
chamber to excite individual atoms of chemical reactants within the chamber. A 
typical reaction chamber 10 (represented schematically in Fig. 1) confines the 
reactants used during semiconductor wafer 14 processing. The 
semiconductor wafer 14 is electrically coupled to a cathode 13, and a plasma is 
initiated within the reaction chamber when an RF signal is generated at a 
generating source 11 and coupled from the source 11 to an anode 12 and the 
cathode 13 by a control and coupling circuit 15.  
 During plasma initiation and subsequent plasma processing, deposits, 
particles, and other contaminants 16 within the reaction chamber, for example 
on the reaction chamber walls and base, are randomly agitated and circulated 
within the reaction chamber. Such particles are readily observed by shining a 
laser beam into the reaction chamber during plasma processing or by 
monitoring the reaction chamber exhaust line. See, for example G. Selwyn, 
Plasma Particulate Contamination Control. I. Transport and Process Effects, J. 
Vac. Sci. Technol. B, Vol. 9, No. 6 (1991) in which the transport and distribution 
of particles present in plasma processes are discussed in connection with 
techniques for observing such phenomena using real-time imaging (and, see 
also European patent application no. EP-A-0 425 419). It is essential that the wafer surface is kept as free as possible from particles 
and other contaminants if acceptable manufacturing results are to be achieved. 
This is because any resulting wafer contamination seriously impacts device 
yield per wafer processed, manufacturing throughput, individual device quality, 
and the per device cost of manufacture. It is therefore desirable to remove all or 
as many of such contaminants as possible from the reaction chamber prior to 
wafer processing; to prevent circulation of such particles during wafer 
processing; and to prevent contamination that occurs when particles trapped in 
the interface of the plasma sheath and glow region fall onto the wafer when the 
plasma is extinguished. Some of these particles are pumped out of the reaction 
chamber through the exhaust system 17, but a significant portion

<CLAIMS>
A method for preventing contamination of a 
semiconductor wafer (14) during integrated circuit 

fabrication within a reaction chamber (10), comprising the 
steps of: 


increasing the power level of an RF signal supplied 
to electrodes (12, 13) within the reaction chamber (10) at 

a first selected rate, prior to introduction of said 
semiconductor wafer (14) into said reaction chamber (10) 

for processing, to initiate a first plasma therein, said 
first plasma effecting controlled agitation and/or 

circulation of said particles (31) within said reaction 
chamber (10); 
exhausting said particles (31) from within said 
reaction chamber (10) to effect chamber cleaning; 
extinguishing said first plasma; 
positioning said semiconductor wafer (14) within said 
reaction chamber (10) for wafer processing; 
increasing the power level of an RF signal supplied 
to electrodes (12, 13) within the reaction chamber (10) at 

a second selected rate to initiate a second plasma therein; 
wherein said second plasma does not agitat
e and/or 
circulate said particles (31).

wherein said RF signal power level for said first plasma is 

increased at a rate of about 500 watts/second. 
The method of claim 1,
 
wherein said RF signal power level for said second plasma 

is increased at a rate of about 50 watts/second.

applying a magnetic field proximate to said reaction 
chamber (10);
