<ABSTRACT>
A crane safety apparatus for displaying a schematic 
diagram of a part of a crane mechanism on a two-dimensional 

screen dynamically as the crane mechanism is operated, and 
displaying on the same screen a predetermined operation zone 

as a visually discriminative zone pattern. The operation zone 
pattern is displayed on the screen in response to the key 

command by an operator during a selected crane operation mode, 
while referring to the schematic crane mechanism diagram 

currently displayed on the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crane safety apparatus, and more particularly to a crane safety apparatus
having a plurality of image display modes and capable of providing an operator with crane operation status settings and
safe operation in accordance with a selected image display mode.There has been proposed a crane safety apparatus (Japanese Patent Publication No.56-47117). According to
the function of this crane safety apparatus, various operation parameters (boom length, boom angle, outrigger projection,
jib setting, and the like) for determining the operation status of a crane are detected with sensors. A specific load
for the operation status determined by these operation parameters is read from a digital memory which stores therein
specific loads for various operation status, the specific load being determined in accordance with the specification of a
crane. The accessed specific load is compared with the current actual load. If the actual load becomes near the specific
load, a warning is issued, and if it becomes equal to the specific load, the crane operation is automatically stopped. A
conventional crane safety apparatus of this type has an indication panel such as shown in Fig.1. The operation status
such as crane outrigger projection, jib setting and the like is set by using switches mounted on the indication panel so
that values representative of the current boom length, angle and the like are displayed from time to time. A safety meter
is mounted on the upper portion of the indication panel. The safety meter displays in the form of bar graph the safety
degree of an actual load relative to the specific load for the current crane operation status.Such conventional technique provides warning and automatic stop for the possible overturn, collapse, or failure
of a crane. However, there is not provided a function to regulate the operation range of a crane when considering other
buildings or the like.Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 58-74496 discloses a method of regulating the operation range of
a tower type crane. According to this method, a crane boom and an obstacle are schematically displayed on a screen
so that it is possible to detect any contact between the boom and obstacle schematically displayed on the screen. In
this case, however, for the display of an obstacle, the coordinates of the obstacle on the screen are required to be correctly
set, leading to not a simple initial setting of the operation range.Further, such conventional technique does not provide a function to

A crane safety apparatus for use with a crane mechanism having
a crane structure with a boom for lifting an article, to assist in

positioning the lifted article or in preventing the crane mechanism from

over turning or colliding with an obstacle comprising:

sensors (201-208) attached to a crane mechanism for generating
sensor signals indicative of the operational status of the crane

mechanism such as boom length, boom angle, and slewing angle;
a display device (211, 212, 213, RAM) arranged to display a
crane mechanism schematic diagram, said display device including a

display memory storing graphic data to display said crane mechanism
schematic diagram and

a two dimensional screen arranged to display a
graphic image in accordance with the graphic data stored in the display

memory, and
a processor (200) connected to said sensors and display device,
wherein said processor is operable in response to the signals from said

sensors to update the graphic data of the crane mechanism schematic

selecting one among a plurality of display modes (FIG. 3 - FIG. 9B) 

corresponding to respective different crane operation modes and
generating an instruction signal, and
the processor in response to each selected display mode generates
a first graphic data of a said crane mechanism schematic diagram

specific to the selected display mode and representing the crane
mechanism as it is being operated, and in response to the instruction

signal generates a second graphic data of a work zone indication pattern
specific to the selected display mode, and stores the first and second

graphic data into the display memory.
A crane safety apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the
processor in response to a selected operation range limit mode generates

as the specific crane mechanism schematic diagram data a boom
diagram (B, P) in a side view, and generates as the specific work zone

indication pattern data a non-operation range (510) displayed with
respect to the distal end of the currently displayed boom diagram on the

screen.
A crane safety apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the
processor in response to a selected target display mode generates as the

specific mechanism schematic diagram data a crane lifting position
diagram (607) which varies with the change in display location in the

status of the boom, and generates as the specific work zone indication
pattern data a target index mark (605, 606, 613, 614) located with

respect to a preselected position on the screen,

data in the display memory as the lifting position changes so that the
crane lifting position diagram on the screen indicates the distance of the

lifting position from the target.

target index mark is a two-dimensional closed area having as its center

said crane lifting position diagram displayed on said screen at the time
when the instruction signal occurs.

crane lifting position diagram moves outside of the border (613, 614) of

said closed area in response to the crane mechanism operation, said
crane lifting position diagram is displayed near or along said border.
