<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes an alternative reaction path 
for the making of quaternary ammonium esters for fabric 

softening. 
The process starts from a chloroepoxide which is reacted with 
ammonia and water to form a primary amino polyol. The 

process continues as reductive alkylation of the primary and 
then secondary amine with aldehydes to provide an 

intermediate tertiary amino polyol. The first part of the 
process is followed by the tradtional esterification and 

quaternisation steps known in the art for making quaternized 
ammonium fabric softening compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes an alternative reaction path for the making of quaternary ammonium esters for fabric
softening.The process starts from a chloroepoxide which is reacted with ammonia and water to form a primary amino polyol.
The process continues as reductive alkylation of the primary and then secondary amine with aldehydes to provide an
intermediate tertiary amino polyol. This first part of the process is followed by the traditional esterification and quaternisation
steps known in the art for making quaternized ammonium fabric softening compounds.The closest prior art to the present invention is US patent 4,137,180 which teaches the production of the same
quaternized ammonium esters as the present invention and their use in fabric softeners.The process to make these ammoniums has a different first part of the reaction route while the second part containing
the esterification and quaternisation steps is identical. Hence the intermediate tertiary amino polyol of this prior
art is provided by the alternative reaction of alkylation of a secondary amine with a chloroalkyl polyol by elimination of
hydrochloric acid.This first part of the known, prior art process to make the desired fabric softening ammoniums shows low selectivity,
and uses for example dimethylamine as the secondary amine which is known to be highly poisonous and difficult to
handle and has to be made e.g. from ammonia and methylchloride. Therefore the problem underlying the present invention
is to provide an alternative process of high selectivity and using less difficult to handle and obtain raw materials
while possibly still utilizing the easy parts of the known process.Other patent disclosures include the US 3,342,840 disclosing the manufacture of a mono ester quaternary ammonium
salt. US 4,696,771 describes a process for the preparation of amino alcohols or polyols by reaction of a secondary
alcanol amine with a terminal epoxy compound for the manufacture of polyurethane.US patent 4,540,821 and 4,654,376 both relate to the preparation of amino polyols by use of phenol, ammonia and
ethylene oxide together with formaldehyde. Resulting products are used in textile softening compositions but are neither
quaternized nor do they contain ester links.The invention relates to a process to provide a tertiary amino polyol of the formula (I)
