<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to composite materials containing boron carbide and titanium diboride in a volume ratio B4C/TiB2 of from 90:10 to 10:90 parts and a proportion of elemental carbon greater than 2 % by weight up to a maximum of 50 % by weight, based on the boron carbide content. The composite materials have a density greater than 92 % TD, a hardness HK 0.1 greater than 2300, a 4-point flexural strength greater than 400 MPa and a fracture toughness greater than 3.5 MPa 2ROOT m. The composite materials of the invention are suitable for producing wear-resistant components or cutting tools.
