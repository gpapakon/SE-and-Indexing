<ABSTRACT>
A radio display pager includes an antenna (4) 
and front end (5) and receives a series of frames from a 

paging station (1) synchronized to the seconds of the 
local standard time. Each frame contains a frame 

synchronizing signal and a frame position signal 
indicating the position of the frame within the series, 

each of the frames being synchronized with a local 
standard time of the paging station. A frame counter 

(9) increments a count value in synchronism with the 
reception of each frame synchronizing signal detected by a 

frame sync. detector (6) and produces an output when the 
count value reaches a predetermined value. The frame 

counter is reset to an initial value in response to the 
reception of a predetermined frame position signal which 

occurs at 1-minute intervals, as detected by a frame 
identifier decoder (7). A time-keeping circuit (15) 

counts locally generated clock pulses from a clock source 
(18) to display the time of day on a display unit (19). 

The time-keeping circuit is responsive to the output of 
the frame counter for calibrating the time of day to the 

local standard time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to radio display pagers,
and more specifically to a radio display pager having a time-keeping
circuit for displaying time of day.A prior art radio display pager, as shown and described in
Japanese Patent Provisional Publication (Tokkaisho) 61-92045, receives a
paging signal which contains a time-of-day signal in addition to source
and destination user addresses and a message. The time-of-day signal
indicates the "minutes" and "hours" of the local standard time. The pager
includes a time-keeping logic circuit which is calibrated by the received
time-of-day signal to produce and display the minute and hour of the
local time on a display unit. To constantly display the time of day even
when the pager is turned off or located in a place where paging signals
cannot be received, the time-keeping logic circuit is driven by clock pulses
generated by a local oscillator. Since the local oscillator is not precisely
synchronized to the "seconds" of the standard time, the displayed time of
day develops a significant amount of deviation from the standard time if
the logic circuit is not calibrated for a long period of time. Published patent application EP-A-0461849 describes a further
prior art pager which comprises a clock and a time-receiving
means for receiving an electromagnetic signal carrying
standard time information, which is exclusively transmitted
for time-adjusting purposes.When received, the standard time information signal is used by
a time adjusting means to adjust the time indication of the
clock. The clock is controlled by a local oscillator between
the receipt of standard time information signals.The invention provides in its various aspects a radio display
pager, a radio paging system and a method for implementation
in a radio display pager as defined in the appendant
independent claims, to which reference should now be made.
Preferred or advantageous features of the invention are
defined in dependent subclaims.The present invention may therefore advantageously provide a
high-precision radio display pager having a time-keeping
circuit which is reset to the local standard time of a paging
station.According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention,
there is provided a radio display pager which receives a
series of frames each containing a frame synchronizing signal
indicating arrival of the frame and a frame position 
signal indicating the position of the frame within the series, each of the
frames being synchronized with a local standard time of the
