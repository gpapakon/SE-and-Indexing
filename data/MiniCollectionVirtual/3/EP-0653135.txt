<ABSTRACT>
A fallback strategy for a system (700) and method (200) is provided for rerouting a call that fails to be established utilizing a first set of constraints in a communication network system. This strategy enables the communication network system to utilize a look-around-first type of preemption that avoids unnecessary preemption and provides alternate routing for a call according to predetermined constraints selected by a user.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to routing strategy
in a communication network system, and is more specifically
directed to identifying alternative acceptable paths for
integrated traffic types.Data communication systems have utilized digital
transmission systems since the 1960s. Digital data
transmission has evolved to a system in which portions of data
are transferred discretely in the form of packets over links of
a communication network system to reach a desired receiver.
For communication network systems supporting integrated
traffic types, especially systems that are subject to diverse
quality-of-service requirements, routing of packetized data
requires a strategic approach. Routing is the mechanism
through which a path is derived for establishing
communication between a source and a destination in a
network (see document EP-A-372270).With increasing demand for a wide spectrum of network
services, routing strategies must accommodate various
quality-of-service constraints: performance constraints (e.g.,
throughput, delay, cost, etc.), resource constraints (e.g.,
transmission medium, channel security, etc.), and priority
constraints (e.g., establishment priority, retention priority,
etc.). A dynamic network status creates further routing
problems. There exists no efficient algorithm to solve a
multicriteria shortest-path problem with a general utility
function including, for example, delay and cost. However, if a
linear utility function (e.g., a weighted sum of delay and cost)
is assumed, the problem reduces to a single-criterion
shortest-path problem with linearly combined link attribute
values. If the assumption is that the "optimal" path must be a
nondominated (Pareto) path, then one can first generate the set
of nondominated paths so that the utility function can be
applied to each nondominated path to determine the optimal
path. A number of methods have been shown for generating
these paths for a shortest-path problem with two objective
functions.A shortest-path problem subject to path constraints is
known to be computationally intractable. Although one
approach, wherein a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm
determines whether a path meets the path constraints (i.e., the
algorithm solves the problem in polynomial time if the link
metrics have a small range of values), and another approach,
wherein an objective function is defined which evaluates how
well a path meets the path constraints, have been proposed,
both approaches have not seemed to be particularly efficient in
practice.A routing
