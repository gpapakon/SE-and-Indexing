<ABSTRACT>
Foldable and transportable beacon, for traffic 
signalling in emergency cases on roadways 

and other uses of the type comprising a support 
base (a) from which a main conical or truncated 

body (b) is erected which, in association with said 
base (a), has an attractive aspect resulting from a 

partially or totally reflectant, fluorescent texture 
or the like. The main conical body (b), which is 

hollow, is comprised of tubular elements (4 and 
6) of different diameters which, when telescopically 

assembled, are displaceable from an inoperative 
position wherein they are retracted into 

each other in at least one cavity (5) of the base 
(a) which forms its holding box, to another extended 

position of said main conical body (b), in 
full high configuration, the main conical body including 

positioning means for the relative holding 
between the extended elements (4 and 6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention consists of a foldable and 
portable beacon for road/street marking and warning of 
emergencies and other uses, the beacon being highly visible 
and easy to be carried. One of the highest mortality rates, particularly in 
Argentina, are due to traffic accidents. A relevant 
percentage of these accidents arise from unproperly parked 
or stopped vehicles, for instance due to emergency causes, 
which vehicles are exposed to be crashed by other 
circulating cars in circumstances of vision defficiencies. Modern highways causes these situations to turn 
particularly critical because of the vehicles high speeds, 
therefore a remarkably warning beaconing, visible from long 
distances, would be the best way to prevent such accidents.  Unfortunately, while modern car speeds have 
increased , the warning capacity of beacons have remained 
the same like the old ones created for slower old vehicles 
and different traffic conditions. The above considerations are of course also valid 
for other transport means such as boats, planes, trains, 
etc. wherein, in particular circumstances, highly visible 
beacons and as large as possible portable beacons are 
necessary. The above cited aspects are essential for the human 
life in several emergency situations, susch as tose 
appearing in small piers and airports, as well as in 
unfortunate and repeated situation wherein a train is 
stopped without warning signs, marks or beacons indicating 
its position. This kind of warning devices are also important for 
operations of security forces, emergencies medical corps, 
firemen, rescue corps, etc. The size of beaconing devices required for all the 
above referred cases becomes an obstacle insofar as to the 
quantity and available room for the easy transportation 
thereof. It is due to the above explained reasons that 
smallest beacones are most comercially required, which 
beacons have been improved by increasing, by several ways,  
 
their reflecting and lighting features. Anyway, since there is a direct relationship 
between the size of the beacon and its signing or warning 
capacity, the capacity of the known devices is restricted. The limitations to the known above mentioned 
devices are overcome by the present invention by providing 
an ingenious device consisting of a foldable conical body, 
comprising several telescopically arranged tubular 
elements, whereby a beacon is defined in its unfolded 
position, capable of multiplying many times its folding 
size. There are some beacons larger than other
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A foldable and portable beacon, for road 
signing, for emergencies in public road and other 

applications, the beacon comprising a flat annular hollow 
body, the inner wall of which upwardly extends from the top 

wall of the annular hollow body, to form an integral 
truncated-cone shaped segment for housing a plurality of 

like height and diameter decreasing truncated-conical 
segments, the segments having at their bases a projection 

cooperating with a recess at their upper edges for 
receiving said projection, a base being provided to close 

the bottom part of said annular body, said base having an 
inner compartment having a dimension smaller than the 

truncated-conical segment of smallest diameter. 
Foldable and portable beacon according to claim 
1, wherein the hollow annular body has a ballast receiving 

opening. 
Foldable and portable beacon according to claim 
1 or 2, wherein light means is housed within the 

compartment. 
Foldable and portable beacon according to any of 
claims 1 to 3, wherein the smaller diameter inner 

 
compartment has a cap at an upper edge, having a diameter 

slightly larger than the diameter of the upper edge, but 
slightly smaller than the diameter of the upper edge of the 

contiguous outer segment. 
Foldable and portable beacon according to any of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein the truncated conical segments have 

a height slightly decreasing towards the center of the 
annular body. 
Foldable and portable beacon according to any of 
claims 1 to 5, wherein the integral truncated conical 

segment has at an upper edge thereof a socket means for an 
upper cap thereof.
