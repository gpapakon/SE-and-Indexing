<ABSTRACT>
Method for hardfacing of parts of the edges of a chainsaw guide bar, where the chain is guided by a groove, where a wear-resistant alloy is applied in a molten state to parts of the edges (12, 13) of a guide bar blank and solidified in nearly final configuration, comprising the steps of: making a guide bar blank (10) having edges located at greater distance from the groove bottom (18) along the sides (17) which are not to be hardfaced than in those parts (12, 13) which are to be hardfaced; and applying a mold (15) with an extending plate (14) against the blank with the edge (23) of the plate in contact with the groove bottom (18); and filling the space between the wall (19) of the mold and the edges (12, 13) of the blank with a paste (16) made from finely powderized hardfacing alloy and a liquid; and heating the paste (16) locally to melt the alloy.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR HARDFACING OF CHAINSA GUIDE BARS BackgroundIt is previously known from the patents US 3,416,578 and 4,768,289 to coat a severely loaded edge with some hard and wear-resistant metal layer at the nose of such chainsaws that do not have a nose sprocket. This applies to chainsaws used to cut minerals, or to cut wood where mineral grains may be lodged in the bark or stirred from the ground. Traditionally the edge has been coated with cobalt alloys, such as known by the trademark "Stellite", applied by gas welding. These have a very high surface tension when molten, and will not run off or sag until they have solidified. The weld metal will form a thick rounded bead along the edge, and much of the deposited metal will have to be ground off to form a smooth running face for the saw chain.Cobalt alloys are relatively expensive, and not very resistant to acidic wood. Nickel alloys with equal or better resistance and lower cost are known, but can not be used in the same way since they have too low surface tension when molten. They might be applied through flame or plasma spraying, where a finely powderized alloy is introduced in a stream of hot gas and transferred as molten droplets to the surface of a cold work piece. This method will als^o consume more material than will ultimately stay on the guide bar and requires much work to grind away the excess.Hardfacing alloys can also be applied according to the patent US 5,144,867 by inserting one end of a guide bar blank in a mold filled with powderized alloy, heating the mold and the blank to the melting point of the alloy to let the alloy form a wear resisting layer on the blank, and finally milling or grinding a chain groove through the layer. According to that patent, the grinding work on the edges and on the outside of the guide bar is reduced. 

The present invention concerns a method for applying hard wear-resistant layers, which also reduces the need for grinding of the groove, and which creates less environmental problems than other alloy powder methods. This is important, since dust from nickel as well as cobalt alloys are allergenic and injurious to health.Description of the inventionAccording to the invention the edges of the nose part of a guide bar are provided with a hard wear-resistant layer, one edge at a time when the chain groove is already made, and the chain groove is blocked during the process by a plate extending from a mold.

CLAIMS
1. Method for hardfacing of parts of edges of a chainsaw guide bar where the saw chain is guided by a groove, where a wear-resistant alloy is applied in molten state to parts of the edges (12,13) of a guidebar blank and solidified in nearly final configuration, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by comprising the steps of:
- making a guide bar blank (10) having edges located at greater distance above the groove bottom (18) along the sides (17) which are not to be hardfaced than in those parts (12) which are to be hardfaced, and
- applying a mold (15) with an extending plate (14) against the blank (10) with the edge (23) of the plate (14) in contact with the groove bottom (18) , and - filling the space between the wall (19) of the mold and the edges (12,13) of the blank with a paste (16) made from finely powderized hardfacing alloy and a liquid, and
- heating the paste (16) locally to melt the alloy
2. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by hardfacing being applied to the nose (12,13) portion of the blank.
3. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by the blank having locally raised edges (11) where the edge portions (12) to be hardfaced meet the edge portions (17) which are not to be hardfaced, and by the mold wall (19) having diversions (20) at corresponding locations.
4. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by the mold being made of ceramic material.
5. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by the mold being made from copper.
6. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by heating the paste by a gas torch.
7. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by heating the paste with a laser. 8. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by the groove having chamfers (21) to allow the molten alloy to penetrate deeper along the inside walls of the groove.
