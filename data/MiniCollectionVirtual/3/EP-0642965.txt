<ABSTRACT>
A brake system wherein the single actuator (40) is freely mounted 
to a first 

brake beam (18) so as to align its force application axis with the axis 
of a first force 

transmitting rod (90) connected at its other end to a transfer lever 
(94) on a second brake 

beam (20). A second force transmitting rod (106) connects the transfer 
lever (94) back to the 

first brake beam (18). The mounts for the actuator and the transfer 
lever are designed 

for use with brake beams of dual actuator brake systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to truck-mounted brakes for a railroad 
vehicle and more particularly to an improved single actuator, truck mounted 
brake. The accepted truck mounted brakes throughout the railroad industry 
approved by AAR is a double actuator system known as NYCOPAC sold by New 
York Air Brake Corporation and its equivalent WABCOPAC sold by 
Westinghouse Air Brake Corporation. Two actuators are used, one connected to 
each brake beam on opposite sides of the center axis. An example of the 
structure is illustrated in U.S. Patent 3,499,507. The next generation of truck 
mounted brake includes a single actuator, truck mounted brake assembly known 
as WABCOPAC II. This structure includes a single actuator with a pair of force 
transmitting arms and a lever connected to the opposite brake beam. A typical 
example of this structure is illustrated in U.S. Patent 4,793,446. As illustrated in U.S. Patent 3,499,507, the slack adjuster is provided on the 
opposite end of the force transmitting device from the actuator and in the 
opposing brake beam. The NYCOPAC and WABCOPAC have no slack adjuster. 
In the single actuator system illustrated in U.S. Patent 4,793,446 the slack adjuster 
is on the return force transmitting device. As discussed therein, it is important 
that the force transmitting elements and the slack adjuster do not intersect the 
openings in the bolster for the various angular positions of the force transmitting 
elements. The single actuator, truck mounted brake provides a force generated by 
the brake cylinder multiplied by a factor of four. This system is very effective as 
a force generated by the brake cylinder is transferred to the center of the arc of 
each of the shoes equally. The center of the force in the middle of each of the 
shoes eliminates wasted torsional components that exist in other systems. In 
extreme arc conditions, the piston in the force actuator is forced to rotate with 
respect to the cylinder. This provides unnecessary wear and tear on the packing 
cup and in severe cold weather conditions could cause leakage. Also, the two  
 
brake beams are not maintained parallel during operating conditions, providing 
further deviations in the arc. A substantial number of cars are equipped with the dual actuator, truck 
mounted brake, and thus there is a need to provide a single actuator, truck 
mounted brake system which can be used on existing equipment which was 
manufactured using dual actuators. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide an
