<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic "mailboxing" unit (10) and system for separating by users the sheet 
outputs of various users of a shared users printer (including facsimile receivers, copiers or 

combination units). It provides for stacking the sheets sequentially outputted from the printer 
in separate job sets into one or more temporarily and variably assigned "mailboxes" (11) of a 

"mailboxing" job sorting accessory unit (10) having a number of variably assignable "mailbox" 
(11) bins. It may also provide a bypass for sequentially stacking unstapled user sheets directly in 

a mailbox without compiling and stapling. A variable display (104) indicates the bins (11) into 
which that particular user's jobs have been placed last and not yet removed. Also disclosed is 

automatic overflow assignments of additional temporarily designated bins for identified users, 
as needed, to provide effectively unlimited or "virtual bin" plural job stacking. An integral 

moving sheet deflector, compiler and stapler unit (90) is shown for collecting, compiling, and 
optionally stapling, and ejecting job sets of sheets for separate designated users into one or 

more of these discrete but variably assigned "mailboxes". The "mailboxing" unit (10) may also 
have "privacy doors" locking for restricting access to at least some of the mailbox bins, with 

electrical door unlocking of selected bins in response to entry of a user access code, and other 
user features.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mailboxing system for feeding sheets from an 
output device, for example a printer, into selected mailbox bins. More particularly, the system 
feeds sheets into selected bins associated with respective users of the output device. Mailbox sorter systems are known for feeding sheets from a printer into mailbox 
bins. Such systems are lacking however in the flexibility of their bin assignment methods when 
the printer has shared users. More particularly, the sheets or job sets associated with two or 
more users of the printer can often become commingled in the same mailbox bin. There is 
therefore a need for a mailboxing system allowing a plurality of users to share a printer or the 
like receiver, without disclosing, compromising or commingling their separate jobs and/or 
correspondence. The present invention strives to meet the above need. Accordingly, the present 
invention provides a mailboxing system in accordance with any one of the appended claims. Disclosed is a "mailbox" system for automatically discretely handling and segregating 
received copier, facsimile or other printer outputs, which can be used as a simple accessory for 
various existing such printers. In particular, there is disclosed an output sheet sorting system 
capable of independently handling and separating different jobs for different users or 
addressees automatically and simply. The disclosed "mailboxing" unit embodiment can desirably be a universal modular or 
stand-alone unit that may be attached to, or even simply moved next to, the output of almost 
any conventional printer, including facsimile machines or networked electronic mail printers. Disclosed is a universal (flexible) job sorting or "mailboxing" sheet output system for 
a printer, copier or facsimile output (encompassed by the term "printer" herein), in which sets 
or jobs of plural physical sheets outputted by a printer are directed into a particular "mailbox" 
bin, or set of bins, and the "mailbox" bins of the particular customer or user are indicated for 
job retrieval. This allows plural users of a printer to have a shared system which automatically 
puts different users outputs into different "mailboxes" or sorter bins. It can also automatically 
discretely notify the users of which bins their jobs are in. The disclosed system is "universal" in 
the sense that the mailbox sorter unit or module is flexible as to where the outputted sheets it 
receives come from, and can be used with many different printers. Also disclosed in an
