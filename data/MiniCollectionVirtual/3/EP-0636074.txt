Procedure for protecting vehicle occupants, in 
which procedure a protection means (30) provided for the 

vehicle occupants, such as, for example, airbag and/or 
seat belt pretensioning means, is activated as a function 

of the output signal of at least one acceleration sensor 
(10) which detects the vehicle acceleration (a), in which 

procedure the future displacement (s), brought about by 
the effect of acceleration after the start of an accident 

sequence, of the vehicle occupant and/or his future 
relative speed (v) in relation to the passenger compartment 

are estimated and the protection means (30) is 
activated if the result of the estimation is that the 

estimated values exceed limit values (sg, vg) which can 
be prescribed within a prescribable future time interval, 

the output signal (a(t)) of the sensor (10) being subjected 
to a Kalman filtering operation in order to 

acquire an estimated value (a'(t)). 
Procedure according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the respectively known activation time of the 

respective protection means (30), such as, for example, 
airbag and/or seat belt pretensioning means, is used as 

prescribable future time interval. 
Procedure according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that a time interval between 5 and 

50 milliseconds, in particular between 25 and 35 milliseconds, 
after the start of the crash procedure is used 

as prescribable future time interval. 
Procedure according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that during the prescribing of the limit  

 
values for the displacement of the vehicle occupant (s
g
) 
and for the relative speed of the vehicle occupant (v
g
), 
the geometry and/or the structure of the passenger 

compartment and/or of the protection means (30) are taken 
into account. 
Procedure according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that a distance of 5 to 30 cm, in particular 10 to 20 cm, 

is assumed as limit value (s
g
) for the initial displacement 
(s1) of the vehicle occupant. 
Procedure according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that a value of 5 to 30 km/h, in particular 10 to 

25 km/h, is assumed as a limit value (v
g
) for the 
relative speed of the vehicle occupant in relation to the 

passenger compartment. 
Procedure according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the output signal (a(t)) of the 

sensor (10) is subjected to at least two filtering 
operations, in that the filtered signals (a, aw) are 

compared, in that the comparison values are accumulated 
and are related to a prescribable limit value (sg, Vg), 

and in that a correction criterion, indicating structural 
changes of the vehicle owing to an accident, for the 

activation phase of the protection means (30) is derived 
from this comparison. 
Procedure according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the prescribable limit values (sg, 

Vg) are functions of at least one operating parameter. 
Procedure according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the prescribable limit values (sg, Vg) are a function 

of time, in particular of the duration of the crash. 
Procedure according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the prescribable limit values (sg, 

Vg,) are made stricter after a prescribable length of 
time as the duration of the crash increases. 
Procedure according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the function (a'(t)) which is 

derived from the output signal (a(t)) of the sensor (10) 
by filtering is approximated by means of an easily 

calculable function, preferably a trigonometric function  
 

or a low-order polynomial. 
Procedure according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the approximately calculated 

function values are stored in a memory element from which 
they can be read out during a crash procedure. 
Procedure according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the prescribable limit values (sg, 

Vg) form a limit curve (KG) which is formed by folding a 
Gaussian function with the function acquired, by means of 

at least one filtering operation, from the output signal 
a(t) of the acceleration sensor (10). 
Device for protecting vehicle occupants with at 
least one acceleration sensor (10) and with at least one 

protection means (30) for vehicle occupants, such as, for 
example, airbag and/or seat belt pretensioning means, 

with an electronic device (20) for evaluating the output 
signal of the acceleration sensor (10) and actuating the 

protection means (30) in accordance with the evaluated 
output signal, and with means for evaluating the position 

of the occupants, with means for prescribing limit values 
with respect to the displacement of the vehicle occupant 

and/or his relative speed in relation to the passenger 
compartment (24, 25, 26, 27), with filter means (21) for 

the output signal (a(t)) of the sensor (10) and with 
estimation means for estimating in advance whether values 

of the displacement (s) and/or of the relative speed (v) 
of the vehicle occupant which are to be expected within 

a prescribable time interval exceed the prescribable 
limit values, the filter means (21) bringing about a 

Kalman filtering operation performed on the output signal 
(a(t)) of the sensor (10).
