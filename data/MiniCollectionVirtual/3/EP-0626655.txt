<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for recognizing a
preceding vehicle by the use of an image processing technology and measuring a
distance to the recognized vehicle.The International Society for Optical Engineering, 1989, USA, pages
256-266, Ozaki, T. et al., "An Image Processing System for Autonomous Vehicle",
discloses an image processing system for autonomous vehicles which is used to
detect white lines which are drawn on the paved road, and to detect obstacles on the
road, wherein the apparatus comprises a stereo image input means, an image
storage means, an edge extraction means, a traffic lane region extraction means, a
vehicle edge searching means, and an intervehicle distance measuring means.JP-A-01 281 600 discloses to properly recognize a traveling vehicle
such as a preceding vehicle from images obtained from the front and rear directions of
the vehicle by providing a traveling vehicle recognition device with image pickup
means for picking up the outside image in the front and rear directions of its own
vehicle, a road area recognition means, a feature extraction means, and a vehicle
deciding means.GB 2 265 779 discloses an obstacle warning system for vehicles,
wherein the previous vehicle is extracted after making distance images from the
stereo images of the scene outside the vehicle. In particular, the scene outside the
vehicle is imaged by two CCD cameras whose output is compared to give the range to
all points in the images. The three-dimensional data thus acquired is then analyzed so 
as to distinguish between road surfaces and other objects. Road surfaces are
distinguished by being substantially planar and bounded by substantially straight
parallel white lines within a moderate distance range. Potential obstacles lie at least 10
cm above the road surface. The relative and absolute positions, velocities and
accelerations of potential obstacles can be analyzed to determine if a collision is likely.
Objects near the edge of the road can be given a low weighting.Proceeding of the Intelligent Vehicles '92, Symp., October 24-26, 1994,
Paris, France, pages 237-242, discloses using binocular stereopsis for vision based
vehicle control.In this process, to provide a simple tool to distinguish between features lying on the
ground plane and features due to an object lying above the ground plane, and which
may appear as an obstacle during the course of the vehicle, a simple threshold for the
residual disparity is set and 3-D points of candidate obstacles are grouped in order to
obtain

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle recognition apparatus which recognizes a preceding vehicle from
road images input by use of vehicle-mounted stereo image input means and

measures a distance to the recognized vehicle, comprising:

stereo image input means (1a,1b) mounted on a vehicle for picking up stereo
road scene images in front of the vehicle;
image storage means (3a,3b) for storing the road scene image information
input from said stereo image input means;
edge extraction means (61) for applying a differential processing to the road
scene image information stored in said image storage means to extract edges

of the road scene images;
traffic lane region extraction means (62) for extracting a traffic lane region from
the road scene image information stored in said image storage means;
vehicle edge searching means (63) for determining a distribution of the edges
extracted by said edge extraction means within the traffic lane region extracted

by said traffic lane region extraction means, to extract a preceding vehicle
candidate region from the road scene image information stored in said image

storage means;
symmetric region extraction means (64) for liming further the preceding vehicle
candidate region by extracting a symmetric region within the preceding vehicle

candidate region defined by said vehicle edge searching means; and 
initial model setting means (65) for setting an initial contour for the symmetric
region defined by said symmetric region extraction means;
contour extraction means (66) for extracting contours of the preceding vehicle
from the road scene image information stored in said
 image storage means on
the basis of initial values of said initial contour set by said initial model setting

means, wherein the initial contour is installed such that the gravity center of the
initial contour is matched to the gravity center of the symmetric region; and
intervehicle distance measuring means (6b) for measuring a distance to the
preceding vehicle on the basis of the contour of the preceding vehicle

extracted by said contour extraction means.
A vehicle recognition apparatus as set forth in claim 1, wherein said traffic lane
region extraction means (62) obtains said traffic lane region such that a width

of a traffic lane in which the vehicle cruises, indicated at a lower end of the road
scene image, is extended double to the right and to the left.
A vehicle recognition apparatus as set forth in claim 2, wherein said vehicle
edge extraction means (63) is for extracting a lower end of the preceding

vehicle candidate region and then for extracting right/left side ends of the
preceding vehicle candidate region.
A vehicle recognition apparatus as set forth in claim 3, wherein the vehicle
edge extraction means (63) extracts region ends of the vehicle candidate

region on the basis of histogram values of a number of edges extracted from
an inside of the traffic lane region.
A vehicle recognition apparatus as set forth in claim 1, wherein the symmetric
region extraction means (64) adds up midpoint position between edges which 

are present on a same scanning line of the road scene images to extract
symmetric axes of a whole region.
A vehicle recognition apparatus as set forth in claim 1 wherein the initial model
setting means (65) determines shape and size of said initial contour adapted to the

preceding vehicle candidate region defined by said symmetric region extraction
means on the basis of width and height of the preceding vehicle candidate

region.

manner that among the vehicle contours extracted from the right and left stereo
road scene images, the contour of one road scene images is revered with respect to its

symmetric axis and is made a shift pattem, and that of the other road scene image is
made a reference pattern, and for extracting a shift amount by which a

correlation value of both the shift pattern and the reference pattern becomes
minimum, as a disparity between the right and left stereo road scene images, thereby

calculating the distance to the preceding vehicle.
