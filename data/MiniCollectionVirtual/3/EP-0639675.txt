<ABSTRACT>
Fastened on the housing part (22) of the backflow preventer for sanitary facilities is an outer sleeve (12) which consists of an elastomeric material and exhibits a sleeve portion (58) which is spaced apart from the housing part (22). The outer sleeve (12) engages around an inner sleeve (14) which is supported fixedly on the housing and exhibits a supporting portion (38) which is dimensioned such that, when subjected to the effect of the water flowing in the flow direction (S), the inner sleeve (14) cannot fold inwards. The sleeve portion (58) bears, under prestressing, on the supporting portion (38) and is expanded by the pressure of the water in order to release an opening between itself and the inner sleeve (14). If the water flow is interrupted, the outer sleeve (12) immediately comes to bear on the inner sleeve (14) again. The end portions (42, 62) of the inner sleeve and outer sleeve (14, 12) are designed in the form of sealing lips. The backflow preventer prevents water from flowing back, even in the case of the extremely low subatmospheric pressure on the feed side. Moreover, it is not sensitive to foreign bodies.

<CLAIMS>
Backflow-preventer for sanitary devices, 
especially for sanitary fittings, having a housing part 

(22, 22') exhibiting a conduit (24), having an outer 
sleeve (12, 12'), made from elastomeric material, which 

is disposed in the conduit (24) and is fastened 
sealtight to the housing part (22, 22') and exhibits a 

free-ending sleeve section (58), facing the outlet end 
(18) of the conduit (24), which sleeve section, 

whenever water flows through the outer sleeve (12, 12') 
from the inlet end (16) of the conduit (24) to the 

outlet end (18), is elastically expandable, and having 
an inner sleeve (14, 14'), which is embraced by the 

outer sleeve (12, 12') and is disposed fixed to the 
housing and which exhibits a supporting section (38, 

38'), which is fold-resistant to the pressure of the 
water, and a sealing lip section (42), which adjoins 

said supporting section in the direction of the outlet 
end (18), the sleeve section (58) of the outer sleeve 

(12, 12') embracing, under pretensioning, the 
supporting and sealing lip sections (38, 38', 42) of 

the inner sleeve (14, 14'), being configured like a 
sealing lip in the region interacting with the sealing 

lip section (42) and ending at least approximately 
beside the free end (42) of the inner sleeve (14, 14'). 
Backflow-preventer according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the inner sleeve (14, 14') is 

configured in one piece and consists of elastomeric 
material. 
Backflow-preventer according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the contacting surface (44) of 

the supporting and sealing lip sections (38, 38', 42),  
 

which contacting surface interacts with the outer 
sleeve (12, 12'), is shaped cylindrically or conically 

tapered in the direction of the outlet end (18). 
Backflow-preventer according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that protruding from the 

housing part (22, 22'), downstream from the outer 
sleeve (12), there are ribs (26, 26'), which project 

into the conduit (24) and bear a bearing element (28, 
28') on which there is disposed the inner sleeve (14, 

14'). 
Backflow-preventer according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the inner sleeve (14, 14') is 

configured like a cup and embraces the bearing element 
(28, 28') such that it is covered on the side facing 

the inlet (16). 
Backflow-preventer according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that between the supporting section 

(38, 38') of the inner sleeve (14, 14') and the bearing 
element (28, 28') there is a free space present. 
Backflow-preventer according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that the outer sleeve (12, 

12') is shaped, in the end region on the inlet side, 
like a rim flange and covers the near-sided end of the 

housing part (22, 22'). 
Backflow-preventer according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that formed onto the rim flange (46, 

46') of the outer sleeve (12, 12'), on the outer side 
of the housing part (22, 22'), there is a 

circumferential bead (52, 52', 96). 
Backflow-preventer according to one of Claims 
4 to 8, characterized in that the bearing element (28') 

exhibits in its centre an opening (78) extending in the 
axial direction, in which opening the inner sleeve 

(14'), consisting of an elastomeric material, is 
fastened by means of a journal (80), which is formed on 

and extends in the direction of the outlet end (18). 
Backflow-preventer according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the opening (78) in the bearing 

element (28') exhibits a bottleneck (82), in that the  
 

journal (80) of the inner sleeve (14') exhibits at its 
outer end a section (84), the outside diameter of which 

is larger than the inside diameter of the bottleneck 
(82), and in that this section (84) is guided in 

button-like fashion through the bottleneck (82).
