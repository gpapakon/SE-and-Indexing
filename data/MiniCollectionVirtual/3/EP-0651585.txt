<ABSTRACT>
An analog circuit controller having fewer signal paths and 
elements is disclosed herein. A microcomputer has a first D/A 

converter for generating control voltages variable into a plurality 
of levels in a time-divided manner and a second D/A converter 

for generating switching signals of various levels each indicative 
of the type of a control voltage. The analog circuit controller 

receives the outputs of the first and second D/A converters 
and responds to the output of the second D/A converter to 

select the necessary circuit to be controlled to which the control 
voltage is to be applied. As a result, a plurality of circuits 

to be controlled can be controlled through only two signal 
lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an analog circuit
controller and particularly a controller for controlling a
plurality of analog circuits in an analog IC through two
different analog signals.TV receivers and audio instruments may control an IC for
processing analog signals through control signals from a microcomputer.
In a TV receiver, for example, commands from a TV
viewer which are indicative of tint, color density and others, in
television signals, may be temporarily taken by a micro
computer and then applied from the microcomputer to an analog IC.One of such controllers is shown in Fig. 1. It comprises a
microcomputer 1 including a plurality of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
circuits 2-4 located therewithin and integrating circuits
5-7 for converting the modulated pulses from the PWM circuits
into analog signals which are in turn applied to circuits to be
controlled 9-11 in an analog IC (8). However, the controller of
Fig. 1 requires one control line for every control function to be
carried out. If the number of pins in the microcomputer and IC
is increased, the wiring in such a controller will become undesirably
complicated.To overcome such a problem, there has been proposed a 
method of time dividing digital signals and transmitting the
divided digital signal through clock and data lines, as shown in
Fig. 2. Digital data are applied from a microcomputer 1 to an
analog IC 8 in synchronism with clock signals. The analog IC 8
includes an address control circuit 12 for decoding the incoming
digital data and for judging which circuit to be controlled the
data are to be transmitted to, so that the digital data will be
distributed to an appropriate circuit to be controlled. The
digital data are converted into analog signals through D/A conversion
circuits 13-15 before they are applied to circuits to be
controlled 9-11.The method of Fig. 2 can transmit different types of control
signals through only two signal lines. However, the method of
Fig. 2 requires a plurality of D/A conversion circuits 13-15 in
the analog IC 8. In general, an analog IC having many D/A conversion
circuits, each of which is also formed having an increased
number of elements, raises a problem in that the chip
area increases.On the other hand, the microcomputer 1 is formed by MOSIC
and therefore does not raise any problem even if there are many
D/A conversion circuits. It is therefore desired that a transmission
process for performing the D/A conversion in the microcomputer
using less signal lines is provided. From GB-A-22 47 547 a
