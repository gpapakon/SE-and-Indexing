<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to install in a multiple deck rail vehicle (1) without restricting the use of existing stairs (5.1,5.2), a lift for transporting objects, in particular a mini bar, between the levels of the passenger compartment, which lift can also serve for briefly storing this mini bar, according to the invention an essentially vertically extending lift shaft (9) is arranged directly next to at least one flight of stairs which leads to one of the horizontal levels of the passenger compartment (6,7) and has access openings (9Z) on each of the horizontal levels which are connected to one another by the flight of stairs, the lower edges of which levels lie in each case at least approximately at the level of the adjoining inner floor (5,6,7).

Multi-storey rail vehicle (1) with a lift
installation with a lifting device for the

transportation of objects between spaces situated on
different horizontal planes (5, 6, 7) of the vehicle,

for the guidance of which lifting device a vertically
extending closed lift shaft (9) is provided which has

an access opening (9Z) on each of the horizontal planes
for loading and unloading the lifting device, the lower

part of the lift shaft (9) and of a prismatic bottom
tank (11) being incorporated by its bottom (10) into

the supporting structure of the coach body in the
region of a transitional slope (5.3) between the floor

of the central plane (5) and the floor of the lower
deck (6) and the lift shaft (9) being arranged directly

next to at least one stair (5.1, 5.2) leading to one of
the horizontal planes (6, 7), and the lower edges of

the access openings (9Z) for loading and unloading the
lifting device, in particular for access with a service

vehicle (mini bar) which can be pushed by hand, in each
case lying on the level of the adjoining internal floor

(5, 6, 7), characterized in that

the lift shaft (9) is arranged symmetrically with
respect to the longitudinal centre of the coach,
its bottom part is flanked on both sides by
obliquely extending bearers (13) of the

transitional slope (5.3), on which bearers the
side walls of the lift shaft (9) are mounted, and 
the floor (10) of the lift shaft (9) is situated
in a horizontal plane below the bearers (13) and

forms the bottom seal of the prismatic bottom tank
(11) secured on the bearers (13).
Rail vehicle according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the lift shaft (9) is arranged

between a stair (5.1) which leads down from a central
or boarding plane (5) to a lower deck (6) and a stair

(5.2) which leads up to an upper deck (7), access
openings being provided in both decks (6, 7) and in the

central plane (5).
Rail vehicle according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the lower part of the lift shaft

(9) and its floor (10) are fitted into a transitional
region (5.3) of the coach body, between a boarding

region (5) and its lower plane (6).
Rail vehicle according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the bearers (13) are connected to

outer bearers (15) by means of cross-members (12), the
crossmembers (12) being loadable by longitudinal

forces, in particular tensile forces, and the bearers
(13) flanking the lift shaft (9) being provided to take

these longitudinal forces.
Rail vehicle according to Claim 4,
characterized in that


the bottom tank (11) is designed with a larger
clear inside width than the lift shaft (9) and
its inner walls are lined with insulating material
for noise and heat insulation.
Rail vehicle according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the access opening in the

boarding region (5) is arranged on the side of the lift
shaft (9) opposite the access openings of the other

planes (6, 7). 
Rail vehicle according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the side walls

of the lift shaft (9) are designed as tension-transmitting
reinforcing elements of the coach body

which connect the under-body of the coach body firmly
to the coach roof.
Rail vehicle according to Claim 7,
characterized in that two mutually opposite vertical

side walls of the lift shaft (9) are formed by
continuous metal sheets which have at least one

longitudinal obtuse-angled bend to increase their
stiffness.
Rail vehicle according to Claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that guide rails for the lifting

device are provided on only one of the continuous side
walls of the lift shaft (9).
