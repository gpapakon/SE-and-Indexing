<ABSTRACT>
An H2S-containing gas and a free-oxygen-containing gas in amounts such that the molar ratio of O2 to H2S is from 0.5 to 3 are contacted, at a temperature below 200  DEG C, with a catalyst for oxidatively converting H2S into sulphur. Said catalyst consists of an activated carbon substrate incorporating a catalytic phase selected from the oxide, salt or sulphide compounds of one or more transition metals selected from V, Mo, W, Ni and Co. The amount of said catalytic phase, by weight of transition metal, represents 0.1-15 wt % of the calcined catalyst.

Process for the direct oxidation into
sulphur, by a catalytic method, of H
2
S contained
in a gas, in a concentration of from 0.01% to 5% by

volume, in which the gas containing H
2
S, together
with a gas containing free oxygen in a molar ratio

O
2
:H
2
S from 0.5 to 3, is brought into contact
with a catalyst oxidising the H
2
S into sulphur by
producing said contact at temperatures of between

60°C and 180°C, the sulphur formed by oxidation of
H
2
S being deposited on the catalyst, said process
being characterised in that the catalyst oxidising

H
2
S into sulphur comprises a support of active
carbon in which there is incorporated a catalytic

phase selected from among the oxide, salt or
sulphide compounds of one or several transition

metals taken from among the group formed of V, Mo,
W, Ni and Co, the quantity of said catalytic

phase, expressed by weight of transition metal,
representing 0.1% to 15% of the weight of the

calcined catalyst.
Process according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the quantity of the

catalytic phase present in the catalyst oxidising 
H
2
S into sulphur represents 0.2% to 7% by weight of
the calcined catalyst.
Process according to Claim 2,
characterised in that said quantity of the

catalytic phase represents 0.5 to 5% by weight of
the calcinated catalyst.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the time for which the

reactive gaseous mixture, formed of the gas to be
treated containing H
2
S and of the gas containing
free oxygen, is in contact with the oxidation

catalyst, expressed in normal conditions of
pressure and temperature, is from 0.5 seconds to

20 seconds.
Process according to Claim 4,
characterised in that said contact time is from 1

to 5 seconds.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the passage of the gas

to be treated containing H
2
S and the gas containing
free oxygen in contact with the catalyst oxidising

H
2
S into sulphur is produced at temperatures of
from 90°C to 120°C. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 6, characterised in that the oxidation catalyst

charged with sulphur is regenerated periodically
by purging said catalyst with the aid of a non-oxidising

gas whilst operating at temperatures of
between 200°C and 500°C to evaporate the sulphur

retained on the catalyst, after which the
regenerated catalyst is cooled to the temperature

required for restarting the oxidation reaction,
this cooling being performed by means of an inert

gas having a temperature of less than 160°C.
Process according to Claim 7,
characterised in that the regeneration gas is a

substantially dry gas.
Process according to Claim 7 or 8,
characterised in that the regeneration

temperatures are between 300°C and 450°C.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 9, characterised in that the gas containing H
2
S
to be treated and the gas containing free oxygen

are brought into contact with the catalyst with a
molar ratio 0
2
:H
2
S of from 0.5 to 1.5.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 10, characterised in that the gas to be treated 

is a gaseous stream containing H
2
S in a
concentration of from 0.01% to 1% by volume.
Process according to Claim 11,
characterised in that said gaseous stream

containing H
2
S is produced in a desulphurisation unit
treating a gas containing H
2
S and SO
2
, which
performs the reaction of the formation of sulphur

between H
2
S and SO
2
 in contact with a CLAUS
catalyst operating at temperatures of less than

180°C at which the sulphur formed during said
reaction is deposited on the catalyst, by

processing, in said unit, a gas containing H
2
S and
SO
2
 in a molar ratio of greater than 2:1 in such a
manner that the gaseous stream given off by this

unit now only contains H
2
S as sulphur compound.
