<ABSTRACT>
To construct a ballastless permanent way (27), concrete is mechanically shaped directly by means of a paver slipform (6). At the same time, a longitudinal reinforcement consisting of a plurality of longitudinal-reinforcement wires (19) is introduced into the concrete. Welded onto these longitudinal-reinforcement wires (19) at equal distances are transverse-reinforcement stirrups (20). For this purpose, welding tongues (21) are fixed to a running carriage (4) and individual transverse-reinforcement stirrups (20) can be supplied to them from a stirrup magazine (16). During the welding of the stirrups with the longitudinal-reinforcement wires (19), the running gear (4) is drawn out counter to the travelling direction (26) and subsequently moved into the starting position by a restoring cylinder (13). It is thus possible to continue the concrete placement even during the welding operation.

Sliding form finisher for producing a ballastless track superstructure (27), whereby concrete
is introduced by machine directly into a certain mould with depressions provided

for fastening sleepers and whereby longitudinal reinforcement (19) is introduced simultaneously
into the concrete, having a travelling mechanism (2), a finisher main frame (1),

sliding form moulds (6) and a wire acceptance feature (17) for paying out longitudinal
reinforcement wires (19) onto the sub-structure (14), characterized in that a welding unit

(21) behind the wire acceptance feature (17), viewed in the direction of travel (26), is
attached to a carriage (4), in that one transverse reinforcement stirrup (20) can be

supplied to the welding unit (21) at certain displacement distances of the travelling
mechanism (2), which transverse reinforcement stirrup (20) can be welded by means of

the welding unit (21) to longitudinal reinforcement wires (19) with the carriage (4)
standing still and the travelling mechanism (2) moving in the direction of motion, and in

that the carriage (4) can be withdrawn from an initial position in the direction opposite
to the direction of movement (26) and can be returned to the initial position by means of

a drive (13).
Sliding form finisher according to Claim 1, characterized in that a control appliance (11)
and a stirrup transfer appliance (18) are provided and in that an individual stirrup can be

transferred to the welding unit (21) by means of the stirrup transfer appliance (18) on the
basis of a control pulse which is initiated by a rotary pulse generator (29) connected to

the travelling mechanism (2).
Sliding form finisher according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the welding unit
has a plurality of electrode holders (21) and in that one electrode holder (21) is provided

for each longitudinal reinforcement wire (19).
Sliding form finisher according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a stirrup
magazine (16), from which transverse reinforcement stirrups (20) can be released individually,

is arranged before the welding unit (21), viewed in the direction of movement
(26).
