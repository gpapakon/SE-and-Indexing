Rotary volumetric machine in which the measuring mechanism 
is formed by a male part (5) and a female part (a tubular 

body) (4) which surrounds it,
 
in which the external surface of the male part (the male 

surface) (50) and the internal surface of the female part (the 
female surface) (40), which delimit and move, through changes 

in their linear contacts, the working chambers, are helical 
surfaces, the axes of which are parallel and separated by a 

length E, defined around these axis by the 
nominal
 profile 
which they have in any cross section of the measuring 

mechanism and by their respective pitches P
m
 and P
f
,
 
in which the profile (1) of the male surface (the male 

profile) has a symmetry of order n
m
 about its centre O
m
 and 
symmetry with respect to the half-lines originating from O
m
 
passing through the extreme polar radius points,
 
in which the profile (23) of the female surface (the female 

profile) has a symmetry of order n
m
 + 1 about its centre O
f
,
 
in which the pitch ratio P
f
 / P
m
 is equal to (n
m
+1)/n
m
,
 
in which the male profile is included within the circular 

annulus of centre O
m
, of half-width E and of mean radius R°
m
 
(the annulus containing the male profile), this dimension 

determining the scale of the cross section of the measuring 
mechanism,
 
in which the female profile is included within the circular 

annulus of centre O
f
, of half-width E and of mean radius R°
m
 + 
E (the annulus containing the female profile),
 
in which the male part (5) is in relative planetary movement 

with respect to the female part (4), the first rotation making 
up this planetary movement causing the axis of the male  

 
surface to describe, at a velocity ω about the axis of the 

female surface, a cylinder of radius E, and the second 
rotation making up the planetary movement causing the male 

part to rotate about its axis at a velocity -ω/n
m
,
 
characterised in that the male profile (1) is such that, 

between two successive extreme polar radii, a running point U 
which crosses it from the point of maximum polar radius (R
max
) 
to a point of minium polar radius (R
min
) (the polar radius 
whose dying away is monotonic), passes through a point A, 

fixed on the profile, whose polar radius R
A0
, its first 
derivative R
A1
 with respect to the polar angle and its second 
derivative R
A2
 with respect to the polar angle simultaneously 
satisfy the following two equations: 


n

in that the nominal female profile (23) is identified with the 

complete materialisable external outline of the male profile 
(1) satisfying the above characterisation, in the relative 

planetary movement,
 
in that, in addition to the n
m
+1 points of contact which 
permanently exist between the male and female profiles (points 

of transmission) over n
m
+1 separate arcs of the female profile 
(2) (arcs of transmission), which each of them travels in a 

reciprocating movement, there exists, for some configurations, 
an additional point of contact (closure point) which crosses, 

on the male profile, in a single direction and in succession, 
all the segments such as R
max
A, and, on the female profile, in 
the same direction and in succession, n
m
+1 separate arcs (3) 
(closure arcs) which are connected tangentially to the arcs of 

transmission,
  
 

and in that the working chambers of the machine are closed at 
a tip in the section where the closure point comes into 

contact with a point of transmission. 
Rotary volumetric machine according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the male profile (1) is a hypertrochoid 

whose equation is written, in the complex plane O

Rotary volumetric machine according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the male (1) and female (23) profiles 

are the curves at the same uniform distance D of male and 
female profiles defined by the above equations with k=0, 

forming an imaginary measuring mechanism in which the distance 
between axes E of the actual measuring mechanism, in which the 

annulus containing the male profile has a mean radius equal to 
R°
m
 - D and in which the annulus containing the female profile 
has a mean radius equal to R°
m
 + E - D, the distance D being 
counted positively in the centrifugal direction and any curve 

at a negative distance D from the profiles forming the 
imaginary measuring mechanism can be adopted only if it has no 

crunode.  
 
Rotary volumetric machine according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the male profile (1) is defined as the 

internal outline of a half-arc of transmission (2) belonging 
to the female profile (23), of ends M and J, constructed so 

that: 

M is at a distance R°
m
 from the centre O
f
, the normal gM to 
the half-arc of transmission at M passing through O
f
 and 
consequently intersecting the circumference C
pf
 centred on O
f
 
and of radius (n
m
 + 1)E at two diametrically opposed points M₁ 
and M₂ [it is prescribed that R°
m
 is greater than (n
m
 - 1)E and 
that the angle (M O
f
 J) is less than 2π/(n
m
 + 1)], 
J is at a distance R

m
) from the centre O
f
 
and the normal gJ to the half-arc of transmission at J is 

tangent to the circumference C
pf
 at the point J₁ merged with 
the point J₂, 
and, for any point C between M and J, the normal gC to the 
half-arc of transmission intersects the circumference C
pf
 at 
two points C₁ and C₂, the point C₁ moving from M₁ to J₁ and the 

point C₂ moving from M₂ to J₂ when C crosses the segment MJ, 
the half-arc of transmission also being chosen freely.

characterised in that the male (50) and female (40) surfaces 

degenerate into cylindrical surfaces (the ratios 1/P
m
 and 1/P
f
 
tending towards zero), and are therefore entirely defined by 

their cross section (profile) (1 and 23), in that the working 
chambers are closed axially by plates (503 and 504) and in 

that the fluid can be admitted radially into the cylindrical 
measuring mechanism and/or escape therefrom in the same way 

(509 and 510), any arcs of transmission (2) enclosing a 
hypertrochoid (1) being excluded. 
Rotary volumetric machine according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the arcs of closure (3) are replaced by  

 
arcs (603) which are external to them, the contact 

corresponding to the closure point no longer being material. 
Rotary volumetric machine according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the tubular body (4) is produced in 

several identical sections (401 to 406), with a low 
slenderness ratio, limited by planes perpendicular to the axis 

(410), located and assembled (414 and 415) in order to 
constitute a single member.
