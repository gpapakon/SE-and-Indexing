<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electro hydraulic braking device for an aircraft landing gear. The device includes two hydraulic pressure sources (103, 104) each feeding a hydraulic circuit (101, 102) leading, via braking demand panels (120), to the brakes of the two groups of wheels. A circuit (101) links either a solenoid valve (151) driven electrically by the control unit (105), or a double progressive distributor (108) driven mechanically by the brake pedals, via two shuttle valves (110, 111) to an input of the panels (120). A second circuit (102) directly links a solenoid valve (152) to a second input of each of the said panels. Each panel includes two symmetric internal circuits having one servo valve per brake involved, which are interconnected at the level of a respective driven valve (127, 128). In the event of a breakdown on one circuit, the servo valves associated with the other circuit then allow control of the braking and anti-skidding according to a paired tandem mode, with automatic reconfiguration.

An electro-hydraulic braking system (100) for the wheels
of aircraft landing gear in which the wheels (R) are

distributed in two groups disposed symmetrically on either
side of the longitudinal midplane of the aircraft, each

wheel (R) being fitted with a brake (F) that is actuated
from brake pedals (106), via an associated braking and

anti-skid servo-valve (123, 124) electrically controlled by
a control unit (105) that obtains measurement data corresponding

to the depression of said pedals and to the speed
of the wheel, the system being characterized by the fact

that it includes two sources (102, 104) of hydraulic
pressure, each feeding a corresponding hydraulic circuit

(101, 102) leading via braking control stages (120) having
two inlets to the brakes (F) of two groups of wheels, with

a first circuit (101) connecting a first inlet (121) of
each of the braking control stages (120), via two shuttle

valves (110, 111) each associated with the brakes of one
group of wheels, either to a first solenoid valve (151)

electrically controlled by the control unit (105) or else
to a double metering valve (108) that is mechanically

controlled by the brake pedals and with a second circuit
(102) directly connecting a second inlet (122) of each of

the braking control stages (120) to a second solenoid valve
(152) likewise electrically controlled by the control unit

(105), each braking control stage (120) being organized
about two symmetrical internal circuits each including one

servo-valve (123, 124) per associated brake, said two
internal circuits additionally being cross-connected via a

respective controlled valve (127, 128) and each braking
control stage terminating, downstream of these control

valves (127, 128), via an associated outlet (135, 136) of
said stage leading to the wheel brakes (F), so that in the

event of a breakdown in one or other of the two hydraulic
circuits (101, 102), the servo-valves associated with the 

other hydraulic circuit enable braking and anti-skid
control to be performed in a paired tandem mode, with

reconfiguration being automatic.
A system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact
that the source of hydraulic pressure associated with the

first hydraulic circuit (101) is duplicated, having a first
source (103.1) fitted with a hydraulic accumulator (146)

for feeding one-half (108.1) of the double metering valve,
and a second source (103.2) fitted with a third solenoid

valve (148) under electrical control of the control unit
(105) to feed the other half (108.2) of said metering

valve, said two sources (103.1, 103.2) also feeding the
first solenoid valve (151).
A system according to claim 1, characterized by the fact
that the source of hydraulic pressure associated with the

first hydraulic circuit (101) is a single source (103.3)
simultaneously feeding each half (108.1, 108.2) of the

double metering valve, and also feeding the first solenoid
valve (151).
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
by the fact that the source of hydraulic pressure

(104) associated with the second circuit (102) is fitted
with a hydraulic accumulator (155).
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
by the fact that the controlled valves are slide

valves (127, 128) biased by respective springs (142, 143)
preferably rated to correspond substantially to maximum

design pressure.
A system according to claim 5, in which each of the two
internal circuits of each braking control stage (120) each 

has a single outlet, characterized by the fact that the
associated controlled valves (127, 128) are single slide

valves.
A system according to claim 5, in which each of the two
internal circuits of each braking control stage (120) each

has two outlets, characterized by the fact that the
associated controlled valves (127, 128) are double slide

valves or pairs of single slide valves.
A system according to claim 6 or 7, characterized by the
fact that the two internal circuits include respective

hydraulic fuses (125, 126) between each of the servo-valves
(123, 124) and the associated controlled valves (127, 128).
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized
by the fact that the first and second hydraulic

circuits (101, 102) include return lines (157, 158)
respectively connected to each of the braking control

stages (120), said return lines being fitted with associated
non-return valves (161, 162).
A system according to claim 9, characterized by the
fact that the return line (157) of the first hydraulic

circuit (101) is also fitted with a solenoid valve (159)
upstream from the associated non-return valve (161), the

closing of said solenoid valve enabling pressure to be
blocked in the brakes so as to hold them in an aircraft

parking position.
