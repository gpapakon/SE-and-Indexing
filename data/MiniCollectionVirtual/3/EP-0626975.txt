<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst system for effecting polymerization in a two-part formulation, which contains an oxygen-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer, consists of a selected acid, a selected aromatic amine compound, and a transition metal compound; active-oxygen, free-radical catalysts are excluded. Because of the nature of the catalyst system, efficient reaction does not require intimate mixing of the two components of the formulation, which may therefore be applied effectively as fine-droplet sprays from a common, ultrasonically vibrated head (10) fitted with a driver portion (14), head portion (12) with opposed parallel planar faces (16), a pair of liquid delivery nozzles (18, 22) and a traverse (normally horizontal) bottom plane (20). The spray converge and intersperse in the region "X" and deposit on the workpiece "W" as a complete formulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chemical composition for 
use in polymerization catalysis and to a two-part, solvent-free 
liquid formulation that is innately curable to an 
adhesive solid and incorporating such chemical composition. 
The invention also relates to the use of such a formulation 
for the production of an adherent solid deposit upon a 
substrate. Two-part acrylic formulations are well known in the art for 
use as adhesives, potting compounds, conformal coatings, 
and the like. In addition to including polymerizable 
acrylate monomers, such formulations typically include 
elastomeric fillers (e.g., urethane oligomers, preferably 
capped to provide sites of unsaturation for enhanced 
reactivity), adhesion promoters in the form of organic 
acids (e.g., acrylic and methacrylic), inert fillers, 
supplemental adhesion promoters (e.g., silanes), levelling 
agents, and other ingredients. Reaction in formulations of 
this kind is normally initiated by use of a free-radical, 
active-oxygen catalyst (i.e., a peroxide, a hydroperoxide, 
or a perester), activated thermally, chemically (e.g. with 
an amine/aldehyde adduct and transition metal accelerator), 
aerobically, anaerobically, etc; they may additionally or 
alternatively include a photoinitiator that is responsive 
to actinic radiation. Illustrative of the prior art that is germane to the 
acrylate formulations hereinabove referred to are the 
following Bachmann and Bachmann et al United States 
patents: US-A-4 348 503, issued September 7, 1982, US-A-4 
429 088, issued January 31, 1984, US-A-4 432 829, issued

US-A-4 974 938, issued October 23, 1990, and US-A-5 
039 715, issued August 13, 1991. JP-A-58189213 describes a method for the manufacture 
of addition polymers in which a monomer of one or more 
acrylic esters or methacrylic esters is mixed with an 
amine, a carboxylic acid, and a transition metal soap to 
cure the monomer. Other prior art of interest to the subject matter to 
which the instant application pertains are the following,
