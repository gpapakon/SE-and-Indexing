<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat exchanger. This exchanger comprises a multiplicity of flat tubes (10), arranged in a stack and each formed by two opposite elongate plates (12), a multiplicity of corrugated fins (26) interposed between the flat tubes, an elongate cross-piece (28) applied against a plate (12) located at one end of the stack, provided with two passages (34, 36) communicating with the flat tubes, and having an expansion-compensaton plate bend (32), as well as two right-angled flanges (42, 44), solidly attached to the cross-piece and bearing against the plate located at the other end of the stack. Application in particular to oil cooling radiators for motor vehicles.

A heat exchanger comprising: 

a multiplicity of flat tubes (10) disposed in a 
stack, each tube comprising two opposed elongate plates 

(12), defining between them a narrow space (14) for 
flow of fluid therein, with the narrow spaces (14) 

communicating with each other through two sets of 
apertures (22, 24) which are aligned in the direction 

(XX) of the stack, and which are arranged in respective 
opposed regions (18, 20) of the plates; and 
a multiplicity of corrugated fins (26) which are 
interposed between the flat tubes (12) and which are 

arranged for an air stream to flow over them, 
 
characterised in that it includes an elongate cross 

member (28), which is applied against a plate (12) 
situated at one end of the stack and which has two 

passages (34, 36) that communicate, respectively, with 
the two sets of aligned apertures (22, 24), the cross 

member having a deformable portion in the form of a 
lyre-shaped expansion element (32) for enabling the 

length of the cross member to be modified, together 
with two L-shaped plate members (42, 44) which are 

fixed to the cross member (28) and which bear against 
the plate (12) situated at the other end of the stack.  

 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the cross member (28) includes a 

flat rectangular plate portion (30) having a U-shaped 
transverse pleat, which constitutes the lyre-shaped 

expansion element (32). 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the cross member (28) has two 

opposed lateral flanges (38, 40) which extend at right 
angles to the plane of the plate portion (30), and to 

which the two plate members (42, 44) are fastened. 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the cross member (28) further 

includes at least one longitudinal edge portion (46) 
extending at right angles to the plane of the plate 

portion (30) for the purpose of securing the heat 
exchanger in place. 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that each plate member (42, 44) has a 

first branch (50, 54) extending parallel to the 
direction (XX) of the stack and bearing against the 

ends of the plates (12), together with a second branch 
(52, 56) which extends parallel to the cross member 

(28) and which is applied against the plate (12) 
situated at the other end of the stack, with the cross 

member (28) and the two plate members (42, 44)  
 

constituting a frame which surrounds the stack of flat 
tubes (10). 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the first branch (54) of one (44) 

of the L-shaped plate members includes a fastening wing 
portion (58) which is bent at right angles. 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 5 or Claim 6, 
characterised in that the second branches (52, 56) of 

the two plate members (42, 44) are terminated by two 
adjacent respective oblique edges (62, 64). 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 5 or Claim 6, 
characterised in that the two branches (52, 56) of the 

two respective plate members (42, 44) are joined 
through a lyre-shaped expansion element. 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that it includes two casing members 

(66, 68) carried on the cross member (28) in facing 
relationship, respectively, with the two passages (34, 

36), the casing members having, respectively, an inlet 
tube element (70) and an outlet tube element (72) for 

the fluid. 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 
9, characterised in that the flat tubes (10), the fins 

(26), the cross member (28) and the plate members (42, 
44) are brazed.
