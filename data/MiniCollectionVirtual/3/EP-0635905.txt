<ABSTRACT>
A grounding electrical connector system includes 
first and second mateable connector modules (18, 100) each 

having dielectric blocks (62, 102) mounting a plurality of 
terminals (80, 106) and a ground plate (68, 104). The 

ground plates of the connector modules interengage with one 
another in a cross-shaped grounding configuration 

therebetween. The terminals (80, 106) of the connector 
modules (18, 100) are located in spaced dispositions such 

that a pair of mating terminals from each connector module 
is located in each of four quadrants defined by the cross-shaped 

grounding structure of the interengaging ground 
plates (68, 104).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an electrical
connector system according to the preamble of claim 1.Electrical connectors are used to interconnect
signal transmission lines to printed circuit boards, other
electronic devices or to other complementary connectors. The
transmission lines transmit signals through a plurality of
conductors which, preferably, are physically separated and
electromagnetically isolated along their length.In the electronics industry, particularly the
computer industry, the predominant system embodies a
plurality of plug-in type connectors in mating engagement
with receptacle connectors on the computer, its main printed
circuit board or other electronic devices. The transmission
lines typically include coaxial electrical cables, either in
round or flat form, and round cables are presently being
used predominantly in relatively high frequency applications
between various system components.Classical coaxial designs derive their
characteristic impedance from the geometrical relationship
between the inner signal conductors and the outer shield
member and the intervening dielectric constant. For a given
impedance, signal conductor size and dielectric material, an
overall outside dimension is defined. In order to
increase signal density and reduce the overall outside
dimensions of a transmission line connector system,
alternate geometries and/or dielectric materials are
required.For data processing purposes, cables usually
utilize twisted pairs of conductors to achieve the necessary 
characteristics, particularly impedance control and cross
talk control. Coaxial cables are used in singular conductor
configurations in high frequency applications, such as to a
high-speed video monitor. Most often, the lower speed data
transmission lines are separated from the high speed signal
transmission lines. Consequently, different electrical
connectors are often used for the lower speed data
transmission lines than for the high speed signal lines.
This adds to the problem of requiring multiple connectors
in ever-increasing miniaturized and high density
applications.Solutions to the above problems were addressed
in US-A-5,102,353. That patent discloses an electrical
connector which terminates both high speed signal
transmission lines and the slower data transmission lines in
a unique manner providing a common ground for the signal
transmission lines.An electrical connector system including the features
of the preamble of claim 1 can be seen
