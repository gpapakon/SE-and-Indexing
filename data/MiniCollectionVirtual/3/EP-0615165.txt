<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electro-photographic 
photoreceptor to form an electrostatic latent image. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic photoreceptor having a layer containing a 
compound capable of transferring electrons. Electrophotographic photoreceptors using an organic 
photoconductor have so far been actively studied because of 
their advantages of non-environmental pollution, high 
productivity and low cost, and some, of them are practically 
used as photoreceptors for medium-speed copying machines. 
Electrophotographic photoreceptors fall into two types; 
namely, the multi-layer type and the single-layer type. And, 
in general, photoreceptors using an organic photoconductor 
have multi-layer structure comprising a charge generation 
layer which generates charges when irradiated with light and a  
 
charge transfer layer which transfers generated charges. In 
this case, high-molecular materials, such as poly-N-vinylcarbazole, 
or low-molecular compounds, such as 
pyrazoline, hydrazone and triphenylamine derivatives, are used 
as charge transfer materials. Since any of these charge transfer materials has a 
positive hole transfer property, these are mostly used in a 
developing method which electrifies the surface of a 
photoreceptor negatively. Therefore, toners which have been 
used in high-speed copying machines cannot be employed and, as 
a result, high quality images cannot be easily obtained. 
Further, such negative electrification on the surface of a 
photoreceptor is liable to cause problems of generating ozone 
by reaction with oxygen in the air during electrification and, 
thereby, polluting environment and degrading the surface of a 
photoreceptor. Though there has been developed a multi-layer 
photoreceptor for positive electrification having reverse 
layer structure comprising a lower charge transfer layer and 
an upper charge generation layer, it is insufficient in 
electrified voltage and low in printing durability and, 
therefore, requires a protective layer to be provided further 
on the charge generation layer. An effective solution of the above problems is to make up 
a photoreceptor which is positively electrified on its 
surface, by use of a charge transfer material with electron-transferring  
 
property in the charge transfer layer. 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone 
is known as such a charge 
transfermaterial, but its low solubility makes it difficult to 
obtain a sensitivity enough for practical use by combining it 
with a
