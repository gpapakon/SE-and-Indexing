<DESCRIPTION>
NEW GINKGOLIDE DERIVATIVES AND A PROCESS FOR PREPARING THEMTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to new ginkgolide derivative, having valuable PAF-antagonistic activity, of formula (I) as below and a process for preparing them, especially a process for preparing Ginkgolide B derivatives by separating only one component of ginkgolide, not mixture.BACKGROUND ARTThe. ginkolides, a terpenoid compounds, from the roots and leaves of the Ginkgo tree are the substances having very characteristic chemical structure. Among ginkgolides being isolated from the natural substance by Nakanishi in 1967, 4 kinds of ginkgolide were determined and named the Ginkgolide A, B, C and M by characteristic of its chemical structure, and after the Ginkgolide J was identified by Weing in 1987. General chemical structure of these ginkgolides are the formula A as below.in which X,, X,, and X3 are hydrogen or hydroxy of the same or not. 

 The above ginkgolides of the formula A are indicated in the following Tablel as below by way of substituent X,, X2, and X3. Table 1.1 C 
Especially, the studies about them are going on progress, becauce it has been found recently that ginkgolides have PAF-antagonistic activity.Meanwhile, Barquet of Institute of Henri Beaufour 'Company in France J5 synthesized new derivatives that substituted hydroxy group in 1- and 10-carbon of the ginkgolide structure with methoxy or ethoxy group by treating the ginkgolide with diazoalkane. (Brit. pat. appl.2, 211 , 841 )It is well known that these ginkgolides are distinguished from the difference of having or not hydroxy group in 1, 3, and 7-carbon in its chemical structure, but it is C very difficult to separate them into each substance because of very similar chemical properties.Therefore, the pure individual substance was separated by passing through silicagel column [K. Nakanish, Pure Appl. Chem. 1967. 89-113] or ion exchange resin such as Cephadex-LH-20 by Weing et a.I.» two or three times, [Liebigs. Ann. Chem, 5 1987. 521-526] after several times of fractional recrystallization using the difference of the solubility coming from the difference of hydroxy group.But, these usual methods for separating using the fractional recrystallization have very low efficiency because of similar properties of each component. Especially because the Ginkgolide A and B have similar properties, Rf values for the Ginkgolide 

 A and B by thin layer chromatography(silicagel plate, developing solvent : toluene : acetone = 7 : 3) is nearly no difference as each 0.32 and
