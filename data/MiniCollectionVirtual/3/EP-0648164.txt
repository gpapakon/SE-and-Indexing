<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a system for centrally securing a wheel (1) with a central drilling (2) to an adapter flange (12) of an axle of a vehicle, in which, according to the invention, a double taper ring (23) can be clamped between the wheel (1) and a central section (17) of the adapter flange (12) by means of a lock screw (5) or lock nut (26) to provide a friction bond between the wheel (1) and the flange (12).

<CLAIMS>
A system for central fastening a wheel (1) having a 
central bore (2) to an axle of a vehicle,
 
characterized in that
 
a taper ring (23) is adapted to be clamped between said 

wheel (1) and a central flange portion (17) of said 
axle by a central safety bolt (5) or safety nut (26) in 

order to achieve a frictionally engaged fastening of 
said wheel (1) to said axle and
 
the taper ring (23) is formed as a double taper ring 

having on its outer side and on its inner side a 
surface which extend slantwise with respect to its 

center axis, wherein the central bore of said wheel (1) 
and the outer shape of said central flange portion (17) 

comprise a tapered section corresponding to said double 
taper ring (23). 
The system as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
an adapter flange (12) is provided between said axle 

and said wheel (1). 
The system as claimed in claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that said taper ring is adapted to be pressed 

between said wheel (1) and said central flange portion 
(17) by a neck (24) of said safety bolt (5). 
The system as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
a thrust plate (4) is provided between said neck (24) 

of said safety bolt (5) and said taper ring (23).  
 
The system as claimed in one or a plurality of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said taper ring 

(23) is radially slit. 
The system as claimed in one or a plurality of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said adapter 

flange (12) comprises a central bore having an internal 
thread (19) for receiving said safety bolt (5) in order 

to fasten said wheel (1) and said adapter flange (12) 
is adapted to be mounted by a threaded joint to a brake 

disc or brake drum (15) of said vehicle. 
The system as claimed in one or a plurality of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said safety 

bolt (5) comprises a recess distant from its head and a 
radial gap (20) extending over a portion of the 

circumference of said bolt in the region of said 
recess, wherein a discontinuity of the pitch of the 

thread (18) is effected by mechanically compressing 
said gap and a self-locking mechanism of said bolt (5) 

is effected by elastically redeforming said deformation 
of said safety bolt (5). 
The system as claimed in claim 1 characterized in that 
said flange (17) comprises an external thread (27) and 

said safety nut is a self-locking nut (26) which is 
screwed onto said external thread (27) for clamping 

said taper ring.
