multimedia communication comprises a repeater (1) for 

providing communication services over a predetermined 
service area, first radio terminals (31, 32, 33) for 

communicating with the repeater (1) by using ATM cells, 
and a second terminal (34) for communicating with the 

repeater (1) by using ATM cells and communicating with a 
backbone network (5). The repeater (1) comprises spot 

beam transmission and reception antennas (11, 12, 13; 
15, 16, 17) for providing radio channels within a 

predetermined service area by means of spot beams, a 
wide-area beam transmission and reception antenna (14; 

18) for providing a radio channel within the 
predetermined service area by means of a wide-area beam, 

first transmitters/receivers (21, 22, 23; 25, 26, 27) 
connected to the spot beam transmission and reception 

antennas for transmitting and receiving ATM cells, a 
second transmitter/receiver (24; 28) connected to the 

wide-area beam transmission and reception antenna for 
transmitting and receiving ATM cells, and an ATM 

switching device (29) having input terminals connected 
to receive ATM cells from the first and second 

receivers and output terminals connected to the first 
and second transmitters for directing incoming ATM 

cells to their respective proper output terminals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radiocommunication
system and, more particularly, to a radiocommunication
system which permits multimedia communications
for transmission and reception of messages that
can contain data, voice, sound and images using an ATM
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technology.Heretofore, wireless data communications systems
have been used in various fields.In "Performance Evaluation of an ATM Packet Switch for a Future Mobile Broadband
Communication Environment" (JG Haro et al) in proceedings of the IEEE Pacific Rim
Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing, discloses ATM data
transmission between mobile stations and other mobile stations or wired stations
through ATM multiplexers and an ATM switch. In "Performance Improvements in
Digital Portable Communications (N. Umeda and M. Maurata) in the 1993 IEEE
International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, there is disclosed a micro macro
overlay cell structure in which micro cells are located at traffic hot-spots to support slow
moving subscribers whilst fast moving subscribers are supported by macro cells. This is
achieved by having micro cells which only cover a small proportion of the area covered
by a macro cell allowing greater reuse of frequency. In recent years,
researches and developments have been made in radio
LAN technologies which permit a wireless version of a
LAN (Local Area Network), in which computer terminals
are networked for communications, by the use of radio
communications techniques.FIG. 1 shows a typical radio LAN system. Within
beam areas B1 and B2 generated by respective radio
transmission/reception devices 801 and 802 having a
bridging function for a wire LAN system are placed
radio terminals 811, 812; and 821, 822. Through the
use of radio channels data communications are performed
between radio the transmission/reception device 801 and
the radio terminals 811, 812 and between the radio
transmission/reception device 802 and the radio terminals
821, 822. By the bridging function of the radio
transmission/reception devices 801 and 802, each of the
radio terminals 811, 812, 821 and 822 can be connected
to a wire LAN system through the corresponding radio 
channel, a wire channel between a respective one of the
transmission/reception devices 801 and 802 and a backbone
communication network 803, and this backbone communication
network. Thereby, each radio terminal is
permitted to receive various services from the wire LAN
system. The radio terminals are also permitted to communicate
with each
