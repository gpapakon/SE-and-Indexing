<ABSTRACT>
The pourability and softening performance of amidoamine 
fabric softeners, such as bis(tallow amidoethyl)-2-hydroxyethyl 

amine) is improved by blending with a quaternary diester fabric 
softener, such as N-methyl, N,N,N-triethanolamine ditallow ester 

quaternary ammonium salt. The amidoamine fabric softener 
includes at least 5% by weight of unsaturated higher alkyl 

groups. The compositions are concentrated with amounts of 
active softener compounds in excess of 25% by weight and, as 

such, may be used at low levels or maybe further diluted prior 
to use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid fabric softening
compositions. More particularly, the invention relates to super
concentrated liquid fabric softening compositions which are
effective in softening fabrics in both soft and hard water and
which are primarily intended as rinse cycle fabric softening
compositions ready-for-use and dilute before use, including both
products.Compositions containing quaternary ammonium salts or
imidazolinium compounds having at least one long chain
hydrocarbyl group are commonly used to provide fabric softening
benefits when used in a laundry rinse operation. Numerous
patents have been issued for these types of compounds and
compositions.More recently, however, in view of concerns for the
environmental safety (e.g., biodegradability) of the quaternary
compound softeners, as well as limits in the amounts of these
cationic compounds which can be stably incorporated into the
more convenient to use liquid formulations, there have been many
proposals for partial or total replacements of the conventional
"quat" fabric softeners which are exemplified by dimethyl
distearyl (or ditallow) ammonium chloride and various
imidazolinium compounds.For instance in GB 2,032,479A, corresponding to EP-A-038862,
water
dispersible unquaternized hydroxyalkyl diamidoamine compounds of
formula
RNH((CH2)nNR)mR 
wherein an average of from 20% to 80% of the R groups are C12 to
C22 acyl, at least 20% of the R groups are -CH2CH2OH or
-CH2CHOHCH3 or mixtures of these groups, and any other R group
is hydrogen, n is 2 or 3 and m is an integer of from 2 to 5, are
provided as mobile pastes in the presence of lower alkanol
solvents. This is stated to be in contrast to partially
neutralized unquaternized diamidoamines which, while providing
highly effective fabric softening properties, are too viscous
even when diluted in the lower alkanol solvents for convenient
handling.US-A-5,154,838 (corresponding to EP-A-0459211)
discloses an aqueous
liquid softener composition based on an amidoamine compound
which is the condensation reaction product of a di- or tri-amine
of formula (I):
R1NH(CmH2mNH)nH
with a fatty acid of formula (II):

wherein R1 represents a straight or branched chain, saturated or
unsaturated hydrocarbon group having 8 to 24 carbon atoms, R2
represents a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated
hydrocarbon group having 7 to 23 carbon atoms, m represents 2 or
3, and n is 1 or 2. These compounds, which are neither
hydroxylated or ethoxylated, are noted to have high
dispersibility in rinse water,
