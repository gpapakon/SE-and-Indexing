<ABSTRACT>
Mixed polyorganosiloxanes containing similar or different units of formula (I
>
 Ra Yb Xc Si O(4-a-b-c)/2  in which:   - R is an alkyl, vinyl, aryl or aralkyl group, at least 80 % of the said radicals R being a methyl group; - X is H or a reactive polar functional group free from the heteroelements nitrogen and sulphur - Y is an at least C4 alkenyl or alkenyloxy residue containing at least one ethylenic unsaturation at a chain end and/or in the chain;   a, b and c are equal to 0, 1, 2 or 3; a+b+c = 0, 1, 2 or 3;  the content of SiO4/2 units being lower than 30 mol%. They are obtained by simultaneous or successive addition reactions or by simultaneous dehydrocondensation and addition reactions or by successive dehydrocondensation and then addition reactions, this being done by starting with the corresponding organohydropolysiloxanes free from X functional groups and Y residues, from the alkene(s) from which the alkenyl or alkenyloxy Y residue(s) is (are) derived and from the ethylenically unsaturated or hydroxylated organic compound(s) from which the functional group(s) X is (are) derived. They can be employed for the production of curable release compositions, especially for paper.
