<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to high strength
magnesium-based alloy materials having superior
mechanical properties and a method for producing the
same.As conventional magnesium-based alloys, there
are known Mg-Al, Mg-Al-Zn, Mg-Th-Zr, Mg-Th-Zn-Zr, Mg-Zn-Zr,
Mg-Zn-Zr-RE (RE: rare earth element), etc. and
these known alloys have been extensively used as
light-weight structural component materials in a wide
variety of applications, according to their
properties. Further, as rapidly solidified materials,
there are known alloys disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-open No. 3-47,941.However, under the present circumstances, known
various types of magnesium-based alloys, as set forth
above, have a low hardness and strength. Although the
alloys disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 3-47,941
have superior hardness and tensile strength,
they still leave some room for further improvement in
thermal stability and ductility. Further, in the
Japanese Patent specification, there is no specific
mention about Mg-Nd-Zn alloys, which are contemplated
by the present invention, and most of the alloys
disclosed therein are alloys including Mg in an amount 
of 70-80 atomic %.Further, WO-A-89/11552 discloses a method of superplastic
forming (extrusion, forging, rolling, etc.) of bulk articles
which are made by consolidation of the powder of rapidly
solidified magnesium base metal alloys consisting essentially
of the formula MgbalAlaZnbXc, wherein X is at least one
element selected from the group consisting of manganese,
cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, and yttrium, "a" ranges from
about 0 to 15 atom percent, "b" ranges from about 0 to 4 atom
percent, "c" ranges from about 0.2 to 3 atom percent, the
balance being magnesium and incidental impurities, with the
proviso that the sum of aluminum and zinc present ranges from
about 2 to 15 atom percent. The alloy used in the known
process has a microstructure comprised of a substantially
uniform cellular network solid solution phase of a size
ranging from 0.2-1.0 µm together with precipitates of magnesium
and aluminum containing intermetallic phases of a size
less than 0.5 µm.In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the
present invention to provide magnesium-based alloy
materials which have an advantageous combination of
properties of high hardness, strength and thermal
resistance and which are useful as lightweight and
high strength materials (i.e., high specific strength
materials) and have a superior ductility.According to the present invention, there is
provided a high
