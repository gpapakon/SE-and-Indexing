<ABSTRACT>
In a chatter monitoring system for twin drives of rolling stands, vibrations of the upper drive (2, 4, 6, 8) and of the lower drive (3, 5, 7, 9) are detected and monitored to determine whether they exceed a predetermined amplitude. If they do exceed the said amplitude, a chatter detection signal is generated. In order to prevent incorrect generation of the chatter detection signal as a consequence of stock entry vibrations, the frequencies of the vibrations of the upper drive (2, 4, 6, 8) and of the lower drive (3, 5, 7, 9) are monitored for equality; if their frequency is equal, the chatter detection signal is suppressed.

drive (2, 4, 6, 8) and oscillations of the lower drive
