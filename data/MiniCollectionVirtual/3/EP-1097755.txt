<ABSTRACT>
In a bending method of a pipe material, in
order to work it with employing a popular apparatus

such as a press apparatus and prevent the pipe
material from being made thin and cracks from being

generated, one side of a cylindrical pipe material
(1) is firmly held by a first clamp (2) and another

side thereof is loosely held by a second clamp (3).
The clamp (2) is relatively moved downward in the

drawing with respect to the clamp (3). At this
time, a pressing force is applied to the pipe

material (1) in an axial direction from both ends
thereof. The pipe material (1) is plastically

deformed by being guided by one quarter spherical
surface (4a) of a mandrel (4) and one quarter

spherical surface (5a) of a mandrel (5), whereby
two bent portion and an intermediate straight

portion are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bending
method of a pipe material.As a technique of bending a pipe material
(a work) at a significantly small bending radius,
"Working Technique of Bending Pipe at Radius 0" is
disclosed in JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN SOCIETY FOR
TECHNOLOGY OF PLASTICITY Vol. 35 No. 398 pages 341
to 346.This prior art relates to a method of
continuously bending a pipe in a shearing direction
by applying an internal pressure p to the pipe (a
pipe material) 1A held within two sets of clamps 2A
and 3A by an oil 4A and by sliding both of clamps
with each other on a boundary surface, as shown in
Figs. 10A to 10C, whereby a bent portion at a
minimum radius can be obtained. A crank-like bent
product is used as it is or is separated into two
parts having the same shape for obtaining two
pieces at the same time so as to be used.In another prior art, Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication No. 6-238352, as shown in 
Figs. 11A and 11B, there is disclosed a method of
bending a metal pipe at a small radius of curvature
in accordance with a mechanical structure by
inserting a mandrel 4B having a front end portion
formed in a curved surface (a guide surface) shape
into a pipe 1B and relatively rotating both of the
clamps 2B and 3B around a boundary line.In the former of the prior arts mentioned
above, since the bent portion is the minimum radius
obtained by substantially perpendicularly bending,
there is a problem that the bent portion increases
a fluid resistance in the case of using the bent
product as a fluid pipe. Further, when using it as
a structural member, there is a problem that a
stress concentration is generated in the bent
portion so as to form a breakage start point.
Further, since the internal pressure is applied by
the oil, there is a problem that a pressure
application apparatus is required. Further, since
steps of charging and discharging the oil are
required, there is a problem that the apparatus is
not suitable for a mass production.Further, in the latter of the prior arts
mentioned above, since it is necessary to make a
rotatable exclusive clamp, there are problems that
it is disadvantageous in a manufacturing cost and a
set-up time, or it is impossible to obtain two
pieces at the same time. Further, in JP-A-56036353 a preliminary process of bending a
pipe is conducted with mandrels inserted into the pipe, and
then, at the next step, the pipe is more bent after the
mandrels are removed from the pipe, so as to form a largely
eccentric pipe. In brief, a preliminary process of bending a
pipe

<CLAIMS>
A bending method of a pipe material comprising the
steps of:


firmly holding a pipe material (1) by a first clamp
(2) and loosely holding by a second clamp (3);
arranging mandrels (4, 5) inserted from both ends of
the pipe material (1) within the pipe material in such a

manner as to be brought into contact with a portion near a
boundary surface of both the clamps or closely oppose to

the portion and so as to extend from the clamps (2, 3) into
a gap formed between the clamps (2, 3), thereby fixing the

mandrels (4, 5) so as not to relatively move with respect
to both of the clamps (2, 3); and
relatively moving both of the clamps (2, 3) in
parallel to the boundary surface in an opposite direction

to each other while maintaining the fixing state, whereby
two bent portions (1a, 1b) and an intermediate straight

portion (1c) are formed in the pipe material (1).
A bending method of a pipe material as claimed in
claim 1, wherein in said mandrel (4, 5), the structure is

made such as to insert a front end of a first mandrel (4)
inserted to the first clamp (2) via the pipe material (1)

into the second clamp (3), insert a front end of a second
mandrel (5) inserted to the second clamp (3) via the pipe

material (1) into the first clamp (2), constitute the front
end portions of the respective mandrels (4, 5) by flat

surfaces (4b, 5b) including a pipe axis and a curved
surface (4a, 5a) being convex to a side opposite to said 

relative moving direction at a time of working of the clamp
(2, 3) to which the front end is inserted, said both flat

surfaces (4b, 5b) being brought into contact with or
closely opposed to each other at a time of work starting in

said gap in which the front ends of both of the mandrels
(4, 5) can relatively move due to a relative movement of

both of the clamps (2, 3).
A bending method of a pipe material as claimed in
claim 1 or 2, wherein a bending process is performed while

applying a pressing force (f) in an axial direction to the
pipe material (1).
A bending method of a pipe material as claimed in
claim 2 or 3, wherein the relative movement of both of the

clamps (2, 3) and/or the pressing force (f) of the pipe
material (1) close to the second clamp (3) are obtained by

common power.
A bending method of a pipe material as claimed in
claim 3 or 4, wherein both of the clamps (2, 3) and a

slider (9, 10) are arranged between an upper table (6) and
a lower table (7) which can relatively move close to each

other and apart from each other, a relative movement of
both of the clamps (2, 3) and a relative movement of the

slider (9, 10) are achieved by an approaching force between
the upper table (6) and the lower table (7), and the pipe

material (1) close to the second clamp (3) is pressed in
accordance with the relative movement of the slider (9,

10).
