  in which the substituents have the following meanings:   R
<
1
>
 is a phenyl radical which can have attached to it one to three of the following groups: cyano, halogen, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C2-haloalkyl and C1-C4-alkoxy, or a pyrimidyl radical which can have attached to it a C1-C3-alkyl group and/or a phenoxy group, it being possible for the phenoxy group, in turn, to have attached to it one to three of the following radicals: cyano, halogen, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C2-haloalkyl and C1-C4-alkoxy,   A is oxygen or oxymethylene (-OCH2-);   X is CH or N, Y is oxygen or NR
