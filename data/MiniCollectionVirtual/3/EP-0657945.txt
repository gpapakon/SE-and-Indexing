<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the application relates to a power semiconductor component, in which an anode-side structure (1), a base region (B) and a cathode-side structure (2) are sequentially provided, in which the base region (B) consists of a layer (3) of a weakly doped n-conducting substrate material and at least one other layer (4, 4') which differs with respect to conduction type and/or doping concentration from the substrate material and which is located between the anode-side structure (1) and the layer (3) of substrate material. The advantage obtained with the subject-matter of the application resides, in particular, in that, when switching off, no dynamic avalanche breakdown occurs and in that the fastest possible decay of the tail current is provided without changing the charge-carrier life and the overall base length.
