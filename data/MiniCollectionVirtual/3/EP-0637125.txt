power generation to excite the shunt field winding of the 
main motor without necessity of additional DC power supply 

for field winding excitation; the auxiliary generator 
including shunt field winding of the main motor can be 

adjusted with regard to exciting current or setting with the 
value of exciting current or the excitation being positively 

increased in response to the speed. While the polar relation 
of shunt field winding to series winding may include 

appearing assisted compound or differential compound; and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DC compound motor 
driving auxiliary generator with its main motor as power 
supply for shunt field winding excitation. More 
specifically, the armature rotor of DC compound motor having 
series field winding and shunt field winding, by virtue of 
mechanical coupling, drives the auxiliary generator for 
power generation to excite the shunt field winding of the 
main motor without necessity of additional DC power supply 
for field winding excitation; the auxiliary generator 
including shunt field winding of the main motor can be 
adjusted with regard to exciting current or setting with the 
value of exciting current or the excitation being positively 
increased in response to the speed. While the polar relation 
of shunt field winding to series winding may include 
appearing assisted compound or differential compound; and 
related wiring connection may include long compound and 
short compound. In addition, it may provide electric energy 
for other loads simultaneously by means of mounting 
auxiliary battery or by virtue of aforesaid auxiliary 
generator. FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the assisted compound type 
circuit for DC compound motor driving the auxiliary  
 
generator with its main motor as power supply for shunt 
field winding of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a diagram showing the differential compound 
type circuit for DC compound motor driving the auxiliary 
generator with its main motor as power supply for shunt 
field winding of the present invention. FIG. 3 is a diagram showing the DC compound motor 
driving the auxiliary generator with its main motor as power 
supply for shunt field winding of the present invention 
having an assisted auxiliary exciting battery circuit. The shunt or compound motor of conventional DC motor, 
if it is desirous to employ field exciting current as speed 
control, usually requires a shunt field exciting power 
supply to match another power-driven winding consisted of 
series field winding and armature. It is applicable to the 
conversion of municipal AC power supply to DC power supply 
but it is not convenient for those portable power sources, 
such as a battery for series and parallel alternating its 
voltage for driving armature winding while shunt field 
excitation shall require another independent battery for 
power supply and excitation, which is not only costly but 
also difficult to take hold of synco power storage. The DC
