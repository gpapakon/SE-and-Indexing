<ABSTRACT>
A motion sensor, particularly for anti-theft devices for 
vehicles, includes a hollow sphere which is fixed to a 

piezoelectric plate; the internal surface of the sphere is 
rough. Inside the hollow sphere there is a ball which may be 

made of metal, so that a movement of the hollow sphere is 
matched by a movement of the ball that makes the hollow 

sphere vibrate. The vibration thus produced is converted by 
the piezoelectric plate into an electric signal to activate 

the circuit of the alarm device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motion sensor, 
particularly for anti-theft devices. Anti-theft devices for vehicles are known that include a 
motion sensor suitable to operate an electric circuit to 
activate an alarm or other devices for immobilizing the 
vehicle. Known sensors currently in use include those which are 
constituted by a piezoelectric plate that supports a weight 
or those in which the plate itself is supported by a metal 
wire. Mechanical vibrations are thus converted into electric 
signals that can be used by the electric circuit of the 
alarm system. However, sensors of this kind obviously do not allow to 
detect certain movements, particularly slow ones. Other types of sensor are also known that are based on 
detection by means of ultrasound. The greatest drawbacks of 
these systems are complicated construction and high cost. The aim of the present invention is to provide a motion 
sensor that can detect any kind of motion, for example of a 
vehicle. Within the scope of this aim, an object of the invention is 
to provide a motion sensor that is constructively simple and 
is therefore reliable and cheap.  Another object of the invention is to provide a sensor that 
can be used in any kind of anti-theft device. This aim, these objects and others which will become 
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a motion sensor as 
described in the accompanying claims. Further characteristics and advantages will become apparent 
from the description of a preferred but not exclusive 
embodiment of the invention, illustrated only by way of non-limitative 
example in the accompanying drawings, wherein: 
Figure 1 is a partially cutout perspective view of the 
sensor according to the invention; Figure 2 is a sectional view of the sensor of Figure 1; Figure 3 is sectional view of the sensor inside a container; Figure 4 is a perspective view of the sensor according to 
another aspect of the invention; Figure 5 is a perspective view of the sensor according to a 
third aspect of the invention; Figure 6 is a schematic view of a padlock provided with a 
sensor according to the invention. Figure 7 is an exploded view of the sensor according to a 
further aspect of the invention; Figure 8 is a perspective view of the sensor of Figure 7;  
 
and Figure 9 is a longitudinal section view of the sensor of 
Figures 7 and 8. With reference to the above figures, the motion sensor, 
generally designated by the reference numeral 1, includes a 
container body 3 which is preferably constituted by a hollow 
sphere the
