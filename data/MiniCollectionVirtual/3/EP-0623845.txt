<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a low volume automatic 
processor for processing photosensitive material which 

comprises a processing module (10) having a narrow 
horizontal processing channel (25). Processing 

solution is directed on to the material (21) being 
processed through a plurality of openings (17a, 17b, 

17c) arranged along the processing channel (25). 
Processing solution is removed from the channel (25) 

through ports (44a, 45a, 46a, 47a) and recirculated 
back into the processing channel (25) through ports 

(41a, 41b, 41c) and openings (17a, 17b, 17c).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in
and relating to automatic processors.The processing of photosensitive material
involves a series of steps such as developing,
bleaching, fixing, washing, and drying. These steps
lend themselves to mechanization by conveying a
continuous web of film or cut sheets of film or
photographic paper sequentially through a series of
stations or tanks, each one containing a different
processing liquid appropriate to the process step at
that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, i.e., large photofinishing
apparatus and microlabs. A large photofinishing
apparatus utilizes tanks that contain approximately
100 liters of each processing solution. A small
photofinishing apparatus or microlab utilizes tanks
which may contain less than 10 liters of processing
solution.The chemicals contained in the processing
solution: cost money to purchase; change in activity
and are seasoned by the constituents of the
photosensitive material that leach out during the
photographic process; and after the chemicals are used
the chemicals must be disposed of in an
environmentally safe manner. Thus, it is important in
all sizes of photofinishing apparatus to reduce the
volume of processing solution.The prior art suggests various types of
replenishing systems that add or subtract specific
chemicals to the processing solution to maintain a
consistency of photographic characteristics in the
material developed. It is possible to maintain 
reasonable consistency of photographic characteristics
only for a certain period of replenishment. After a
processing solution has been used a given number of
times, the solution is discarded and a new processing
solution is added to the tank.Activity degradation due to instability of
the chemistry, or chemical contamination, after the
components of the processing solution are mixed
together causes one to discard the processing solution
in smaller volume tanks more frequently than larger
volume tanks. Some of the steps in the photographic
process utilize processing solutions which contain
chemicals that are unstable, i.e., they have a short
process life. Thus, processing solutions in tanks
which contain unstable chemicals are discarded more
frequently than processing solutions in tanks that
contain stable chemicals.U.S. Patent 5,179,404 discloses a processing
apparatus wherein a narrow processing channel is
formed between a rack and a tank. The photosensitive
material is transported through the narrow channel by
appropriate rollers
