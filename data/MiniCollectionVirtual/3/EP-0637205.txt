<DESCRIPTION>
 FROZEN CONFECTIONThe present invention relates to a frozen dessert product, including and in particular ice confection products, usually non-aerated, although aerated products are not excluded, and preferably to water ice products. When quiescently freezing these products relatively large ice crystals are formed, starting from the surface where the fluid mix is in thermal contact with a cold surface. This results in a dendritic crystal structure (needles) . Smaller ice crystals may be obtained by either continuously or intermittently whipping or agitating the mix when at least some ice crystals are present, resulting in a different eating experience, such as a softer texture and a creamier, smoother and less icy mouth feel. Obtaining these properties either requires an additional process step and more complicated production machines or additional additives.An object of the present invention is to provide a system for easily controlling the ice crystal growth in quiescently frozen dessert products and especially in frozen confection products such as in particular fat free ice confection products like sorbet ice products and specifically water ice products where otherwise large dendritic ice crystals may be experienced.Briefly in accordance with the present invention the growth of dendritic ice crystals in quiescently frozen dessert products can be controlled and the eating experiences of these quiescently frozen products may be improved by controlling ice crystal dendrite thickness not to exceed 100 μm and more preferred not to exceed 80 μm and even more preferred not to exceed 60 μm.The controlled growth of the dendritic ice crystals is in particular important with water ices, which normally freeze 

very hard and crunchy when quiescently frozen.Determination of the thermal transition temperature may be carried out as follows by differential scanning calorimetry. About 10 mg of solution is sealed in a pan. An empty pan is used as a reference and these pans are crash-cooled and thereafter warmed at a rate of 5°C per minute. The thermal transition temperature is seen as a change in the heat capacity before the ice melting or dissolving curve. This change may be a step or a peak. There may be other small changes prior to this change, but the thermal transition is defined as the last change before the ice melting/dissolving curve.The frozen products meeting the crystal size requirement of this invention, although quiescently frozen, showed a softer, chewier texture than the usual quiescently frozen water
