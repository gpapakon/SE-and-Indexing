<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drugs and more
specifically the invention relates to heterocyclic
drug compositions containing carbon and nitrogen atoms
in the ring, Even yet more specifically the present
invention relates to substituted 1,4,5,6
-tetrahydropyrimidine compositions, substituted 1,2,3,6
-tetrahydropyrimidine compositions, and substitued
3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine compositions.Further, the invention also
relates to pharmaceutical preparations comprising such
compositions and a suitable carrier.The neurotransmitter acetylcholine mediates a
variety of responses within the central nervous system
and plays an important role in memory function and
cognition. Cholinergic responses are mediated by
muscarinic and nicotinic receptors throughout the
brain, although it is accepted generally that receptors
in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus are associated
with memory and cognitive function. Agents that block
acetylcholine activity at muscarinic receptors and
lesions of cholinergic projections to the cortex and
hippocampus impair memory and cognition.In humans, the nucleus basalis of Meynert is the
source of acetylcholine for the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus. The cholinergic cells within the basal
nucleus degenerate in Alzheimer's disease, a disorder
that is associated with memory dysfunction and
progressive cognitive decline, Current therapeutic
approaches for Alzheimer's disease include treatment 
with agents that increase levels of acetylcholine or
mimic the effects of acetylcholine at receptors.Efforts to increase acetylcholine levels have
focused on increasing levels of choline, the precursor
for acetylcholine synthesis, and on blocking
acetylcholinesterase (AChEase), the enzyme that
metabolizes acetylcholine, The first approach, using
either choline or phosphatidylcholine, has not been
very successful although acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors have shown some therapeutic efficacy.
Clinical trials with these compounds have documented
some improvements in cognitive function and ability to
conduct daily tasks. Major drawbacks with AChEase
inhibitors include toxicity and the side effects
associated with activation of receptors in the
peripheral nervous system.Recent efforts have focused on treating
Alzheimer's patients with agonists for muscarinic
cholinergic receptors. Natural products, such as the
arecoline and pilocarpine ligands, can mimic the
effects of acetylcholine at receptors in the central
nervous system and reverse cognitive impairments in
experimental animals. The clinical application of
