<ABSTRACT>
A releasable connection between a beam of for instance 
an office table and an element which has to be connected 

thereto, for instance a table leg or cross beam, consists of 
openings lying in register in the limbs of the beam, wherein 

an attachment piece coupled to the element for connecting is 
placed through a slot in the web of the beam. By placing a 

coupling piece through the openings and displacing a ball 
element present in a channel in the coupling piece 

transversely of the longitudinal direction of the channel a 
clamping force is generated between the elements for 

connecting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a releasable connection 
between a U-shaped beam of for instance an office table and 
an element for connecting thereto, for instance a table leg 
or cross beam. It is the object of the invention to provide a rapidly 
and simply effected coupling between different elements of 
an office furnishing, for instance a table. The connection 
must preferably be as universal as possible, with the 
understanding that the coupling can be effected between for 
example a table leg or a cross beam for supporting a table 
leaf. DE-A-2342995 describes connection of an element to a box beam, by an 
attachment piece on the element extending through a side wall of the beam 
and being secured by a coupling piece inserted axially into the end of the beam. The object is achieved according to the invention by openings 
lying in register in the limbs of the U-shaped beam, an 
attachment piece coupled to the element for connecting, 
placeable through a slot in the web of the U and having an 
opening corresponding in shape and size with the openings in 
the limbs, a close-fitting coupling piece placeable through 
the openings in the limbs and attachment piece, and a clamping member displaceable by a member connected to 
the coupling piece to exert a clamping force on the 
attachment piece. A particularly advantageous embodiment of a clamping 
member consists of a ball element displaceable in a channel 
transversely of the longitudinal direction of a coupling 
piece. The ball element can be driven by a screw bolt 
movable transversely of the channel and engaging on the ball 
element. The clamping force exerted by the ball element is 
controlled by tightening the screw bolt. In the web of the U a slot can further be arranged for 
passage of a fastening screw rotatable into a coupling 
piece connected to a further element. If the coupling piece is connected to for instance  
 
the cross beam, the desired coupling can thus be obtained by 
tightening the fastening screw. In preference multiple pairs of openings lying in 
register are arranged in longitudinal direction of the U-shaped 
beam. This offers the possibility of coupling for 
instance a table leg at a location where, in view of the 
lay-out, connection to other items of furniture and the 
like, this is most desirable. The cross section of the channel at the end thereof is 
chosen less than the diameter of the ball element in 
order to avoid the ball element leaving the channel. The invention is further elucidated with reference to 
the drawings of

<CLAIMS>
Releasable connection between a U-shaped beam of for 
instance an office table and an element for connecting 

thereto, for instance a table leg or cross beam,
characterized by
 openings lying in register in the limbs of 
the U-shaped beam (2), an attachment piece (8) coupled to the 

element (6) for connecting, placeable through a slot in the web 
of the U and having an opening (11) corresponding in shape and 

size with the openings in the limbs, a close-fitting 
coupling piece (12) placeable through the openings in the limbs and attachment piece, and a 

clamping member (16) displaceable by a member connected to the coupling piece 
to exert a clamping force on the attachment piece. 
Connection as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the clamping member (16) is a ball element displaceable in a 
channel (15) transversely of the longitudinal direction of the 

coupling piece. 
Connection as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the displacement of the ball element is driven by a 
screw bolt (17) movable transversely of the channel and engaging 

on the ball element. 
Connection as claimed in claims 1-3, 
characterized 
in that
 in the web of the U is further arranged a slot for 
passage of a fastening screw (21) rotatable into a coupling 

piece (23) connected to a further element (5). 
Connection as claimed in claims 1-4, 
characterized 
in that
 multiple pairs of openings (9,10) lying in register are 
arranged in longitudinal direction of the U-shaped beam. 
Connection as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the cross section of the channel at the end thereof is 
chosen less than the diameter of the ball element.
