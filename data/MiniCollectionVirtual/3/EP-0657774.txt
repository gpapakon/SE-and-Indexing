<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
prevention of static buildup on polymeric materials by 
the addition of antistatic layers to those materials. 
In particular, the invention relates to antistatic 
coatings in association with imageable materials. Many different polymeric materials have been 
long recognized as suffering from electrostatic charge 
buildup during use. The problems associated with such 
static charging may be as modest as sparks from moving 
about on polymeric carpeting and popping sounds on 
phonograph records or as serious as memory erasure on 
computer disks and false artifacts in photographic 
film. One usual method of reducing static buildup 
is the addition of a conductive layer or low surface 
resistivity layer to the polymeric article. It is 
common in the protection of shaped polymeric articles, 
including carpets, to treat the polymer with reactive 
or absorbable salts (e.g., U.S. Pat. 3,309,223 and 
4,313,978). It is also known to form layers of 
inorganic metal oxides, either in film or particulate 
form to decrease the surface resistivity (e.g., U.S. 
Pat. 4,203,769 and 4,394,441). These antistatic 
coatings are known to be particularly desirable and 
useful as subbing layers in photographic articles 
(e.g., U.S. Pat. 3,874,879). Another antistatic layer for photographic 
materials is described in EPO Application 0 301 827 A2  
 
published February 1, 1989 where a continuous gelled 
network of inorganic oxide particulates, including 
silica, are coated onto a substrate along with an 
ambifunctional silane to increase the wet adhesion of 
the antistatic layer to gelatin. These coatings tend 
to lose their antistatic properties when overcoated 
with a photographic construction because of penetration 
of gelatin into the pores of the layer. U.S. Patent No. 5,236,818, having the same 
inventor and assignee hereof, describes a coating 
composition comprising sodium orthosilicate, colloidal 
inorganic oxide particulates such as silica, and a 
coupling agent (silane) which is applied to substrates 
to provide an antistatic layer. Copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 
08/069,924, filed May 28, 1993, describes a coating 
composition comprising sodium or potassium 
metasilicate, colloidal inorganic oxide particulates 
such as silica, and a coupling agent (silane) which is 
applied to substrates to provide an antistatic layer. A coating composition comprising an alkali 
metal (e.g., sodium or potassium) silicate (e.g., 
orthosilicate or metasilicate), colloidal inorganic 
oxid
