<ABSTRACT>
The level of a liquid (14) is detected by an ultrasonic arrangement comprising a transmitter (10) and a receiver (12). The transmitter (10) has a vertical array of transmitter segments (16) which transmit sequentially, while the receiver (12) is a single transducer. The difference in transmission time in liquid and gas allows a digital, depth representative output to be generated. The transmitter (10) is formed by securing a single sheet (20) of piezo polymer film over a printed circuit board (24) having a conductive pattern defining the segments (16). Other embodiments provide analogue outputs, and non-linear outputs representative of volume in irregular tanks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for sensing the level 
of liquid within a container. An object of the invention is to provide such a device in 
the form of a solid state arrangement having no moving 
parts and readily adaptable to deal with containers of 
non-uniform shape. There are applications where it is desirable to determine 
liquid level as a discrete, rather than continuous, 
function. An example of such a case is where the final 
display of level is desired to be are digital readout. 
Certain forms of the present invention provide a device 
which fulfills this function by providing a plurality of 
independent ultrasonic transducers disposed,in such a way 
that the presence or absence of liquid adjacent a given 
transmitter element and a given receiver element can 
readily be detected. In SU 1592-731-A is described a liquid level sensor having 
an ultrasonic driver having a plurality of sensors mounted 
on parallel shaped bars positioned transversely and along 
the depth of the liquid. The drivers and sensors are 
sequentially excited and accessed via a control circuit. 
There are transmitters and receivers spaced apart and 
opposed to each other for detecting the presence of 
liquid. US 4,063,457 discloses a liquid level detector comprising 
an elongated tubular housing having an inlet means at a 
lower end to let liquid into the interior of the housing, 
and a plurality of ultrasonic transmitters at a plurality 
of levels, positioned opposite a plurality of ultrasonic  
 
receivers at a plurality of levels on another side of the 
tube. Depending on the level of the liquid, the signals 
transmitted from the transmitter to the receivers are 
dampened thereby enabling detection of the liquid level. 
The transmitters are not sequentially addressed. DE-U-90 10 566 discloses a ceramic piezoelectric 
ultrasound device having a planar transmitter and planar 
receiver spaced therefrom, for example in a liquid, for 
detecting certain levels of the liquid. This device can 
only distinguish between a few different levels of liquid, 
as there are only one or two transmitter segments 
extending along the whole depth of the transmitter. The article (Advances in Instrumentation, Volume 43, No. 
3, 1988, Research Triangle Park US, pages 1125-1133, 
XP000111567; H.OWADA et al. 'A two-wire ultrasonic level 
meter with piezoelectric polymer-film sensor') discloses 
an ultrasonic level detector that has a piezoelectric 
polymer-film transmitter/receiver positionable at a 
certain height above the liquid to
