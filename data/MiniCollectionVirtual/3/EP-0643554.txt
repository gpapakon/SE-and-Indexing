<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention pertains to materials and methods useful for management of certain pests. The invention is particularly well suited for the control of social insect pests and, particularly, termites. The invention concerns unique toxicant-containing matrices as well as apparatuses for monitoring pest activity and presenting a toxicant. The invention is useful as part of an Integrated Pest Management Program and can greatly reduce the introduction of harmful chemicals into the environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
Subterranean termites most often enter structures from the surroundine soil to feed on
wood, or other cellulosic material, of the structure and its contents. If unchecked, termites can
cause considerable damage. As a result, efforts to erect physical or chemical barriers to prevent
the entrance of termites into a structure or to exterminate the termites after they have invaded
a structure have proven a considerable expense to the public (Su, N.Y, J.H. Scheffrahn [1990]
Sociobiol. 17(1):77-94). The cost to control termites in the United States exceeds one billion
dollars annually (Mauldin, J.K., S.C Jones, R.H. Beal [1987] The International Research Group
on Wood Preservation Document No. IRG/WP/1323).Subterranean termites construct an extensive foraging gallery beneath the soil surface.
A single colony may contain several million termites with foraging territory extending up to 300
feet (Su, N.Y., R.H. Scheffrahn [1988] Sociobiol. 14(2)-353-359). Since subterranean termites are
a cryptic creature, their presence is not normally known until after some damage, foraging tubes,
or live termites such as swarmers, are found. Some subterranean termites are known to forage
beneath an object on the soil surface (Ettershank, G., J.A. Ettershank, W.G. Whitford [1980]
Environ. Entomol. 9:645-648).Currently, there are two basic approaches for the control of subterranean termites:
preventive control and remedial control. In some of the United States, it is mandatory that the
soil underlying the foundation of newly constructed buildings be pre-treated with a pesticide (also
referred to herein as termiticide) to prevent termite infestation. Pesticide is typically sprayed over
and into the soil prior to construction. This pre-construction treatment produces a horizontal
barrier beneath the building. Because of the lack of communication between pesticide applicator
and construction workers, the barrier often loses its continuity during the construction. Moreover.
the currently available soil termiticides tend to lose their biological activity after five or more
years to the extent that the treated soil is no longer effective against termite invasion. Established
termite colonies in the soil may then invade the structure if additional chemical is not applied
beneath and around the structure. When a house or other building is infested by subterranean termites, efforts are made to
create a continuous barrier beneath the building in the soil where the subterranean termites are
provided access to the building. A common method

<CLAIMS>
A toxin delivery housing for controlling subterranean termites, the toxin
delivery housing comprising one or more sidewalls, the one or more sidewalls

comprising a plurality of openings that define termite exit or entry points, the one
or more sidewalls enclosing a toxicant-containing matrix, the toxin delivery

housing being made from a material that resists decay or corrosion when placed
in a cavity in the ground and that is not eaten by termites, wherein the

arrangement when positioned in a cavity in the ground is such that a monitoring
device or toxicant-containing matrix enclosed within the housing can be added or

removed with minimal disruption to foraging termites.
A housing as claimed in Claim 1, comprising a closed chamber portion in
termite communication with the toxicant-containing matrix, the closed chamber

portion having no sidewall openings, and the closed chamber portion being
adapted to receive a captured, live termite such that the termite must tunnel

through the toxicant-containing matrix in order to gain exit from the housing via
one of the termite exit or entry points.
A housing as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the toxicant-containing matrix is
contained within a casing, and wherein at least part of the said casing is

impenetrable to termites, wherein the said chamber is defined by the said
impenetrable part of the casing and a toxicant-containing matrix, such that

termites placed in the chamber are forced to move through the toxicant-containing
matrix in order to exit the chamber.
A housing as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the toxin delivery housing is
adapted to force termites through the toxicant-containing matrix in order to exit

the said chamber.
A housing as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, which further
comprises a cover which extends beyond the edges of the housing. 
A housing as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the cover comprises a lid which
can be opened to facilitate placement and removal of the toxicant-containing

matrix.
A housing as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the lid comprises an
engagement mechanism which makes the lid difficult for children to open or

which requires a tool to open wherein the tool is specifically adapted for opening
the lid.
A housing, according to any one of the preceding claims, including an
extractor which facilitates the placement or removal of the termite toxin material

and/or monitoring device into or out of said housing.
A toxin delivery housing as claimed in Claim 1, including a toxicant
delivery tube adapted to be received within the housing.
A toxin delivery housing as claimed in Claim 9, wherein the toxicant
delivery tube has openings to permit entry by the termite.
A method of controlling subterranean termites which method comprises
placing in a cavity in the ground a toxin delivery housing comprising one or more

sidewalls, the one or more sidewalls comprising a plurality of openings that
define termite exit or entry points, the one or more sidewalls enclosing a toxicant-containing

matrix, the toxin delivery housing being made from a material that
resists decay or corrosion when placed in a cavity in the ground and that is not

eaten by termites such that the plurality of openings in the one or more sidewalls
provide access for the subterranean termites to the enclosed toxicant-containing

matrix, and adding or removing toxicant-containing matrix to the housing, with
minimal disruption to foraging termites.
Apparatus for controlling a population of termites, comprising a toxicant

delivery device containing a toxicant-containing matrix, wherein the toxicant
delivery device also comprises a closed chamber for receiving captured termites, 

the closed chamber being such that the termites must tunnel through the
toxicant-containing matrix in order to exit from the toxicant-delivery device.
A method of controlling subterranean termites, which method comprising
placing in a cavity in the ground a toxin delivery housing as claimed in any one of

Claims 2 to 4, or apparatus as claimed in Claim 12, and placing a captured live
termite in the closed chamber, such that the termite must tunnel through the

toxicant-containing matrix, in order to exit from the closed chamber.
The use of apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 10 or claim 12 as a toxin
delivery device for controlling subterranean termites.
