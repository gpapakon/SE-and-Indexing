<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a laser safety filter against radiation from CO2 lasers. This laser safety filter is constructed in this case of one or more layers (coatings). According to the invention, at least one of the layers of the laser safety filter consists of glass ceramic. This should advantageously be the front layer.

<CLAIMS>
Laser protective goggles into which a laser
protective filter (1, 4) against radiation from CO
2

lasers is inserted, which filter is constructed from
one or more layers (2, 3, 5, 6), at least one of the

layers being produced from the glass ceramic material
of "Zerodur" glass ceramic (trademark of the company

Glaswerke Schott".
Laser protective goggles according to Claim 1,
in which the layer, consisting of "Zerodur", of the

filter (4) is arranged as an outer coating (5) in front
of the following layers.
Laser protective goggles according to one of
Claims 1-2, characterized in that, in the range of 20°C

- 300°C, the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of
the filter (1, 4) is smaller than 3 x 10
-6
/°C (at room
temperature).
Laser protective goggles according to one of
Claims 1-3, characterized in that, in the range of 20°C

- 300°C, the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of
the filter (1, 4) is smaller than 0.1 x 10
-6
/°C.
Laser protective goggles according to one of
Claims 1-4, characterized in that the filter (1, 4) is

constructed from two glass ceramic layers (2, 3, 5, 6).
Laser protective goggles according to one of
Claims 1-5, characterized in that the inner, rear layer

(6) of the filter (4) is designed as a correcting lens.
