<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
causing blends of bitumen and polymer to become
storage-stable.It is known that in order to improve the quality
of bitumen, in particular from the rheological
viewpoint, various types of polymers are used, in
particular copolymers of elastomeric type.So, e.g., US-A-4,217,259 teaches using
symmetrical radial copolymers constituted by diene
blocks and vinylaromatic blocks; US-A-4,585,816
teaches using block copolymers of a monoalkenyl
aromatic species and a conjugated diolefin; US-A-3,915,914
teaches using 1-butene homopolymers and
copolymers; US-A-3,615,830 claims isoolefin
copolymers, in particular polyisobutene.The most effective polymeric additives seem to be
the styrene-diolefin block copolymers, in particular
styrene/butadiene and styrene/isoprene block
copolymers.The so modified bitumens can be destined to uses
for which the performance of normal bitumens proves to
be insufficient. Thus, applications in the field of
draining and sound-absorbent conglomerates, in the
field of water-proofing systems, and so forth, may be
cited.However, the polymers used in order to modify the
properties of bitumens generally display the drawback
of being poorly compatible with said bitumens. This 
lack of compatibility manifests itself as the trend of
both components to undergo phase separation under
resting conditions; in that way, a polymer-rich top
layer and a bitumen-rich bottom layer are formed.The above said drawback is particularly serious
when the production locality does not coincide, as it
often happens, with the application locality, or when
between the preparation time and the application time,
a more or less long time period elapses.Therefore, the storage-stability of bitumenpolymer
blends, in particular when hot, results to be
very important for the purposes of a correct and
advantageous use thereof.In order to solve this problem, BE-858,770; BE-858,771
and BE-870,287 disclose reactions of bitumen
with polyolefins containing one or more double bonds.
The polyolefin gets anchored to bitumen by means of
sulfur, which acts as a crosslinking agent.EP-A-0 496 457 discloses a process which
consists in causing the bitumen-polymer blend to react
with an unsaturated dicarboxy acid, or its anhydride,
in particular with maleic anhydride. This process
displays the drawback deriving from the toxicity of
maleic anhydride.EP-A-0 300 788 teaches a multi-step process for preparing modified
bitumen compositions, whereby an asphalt, previously treated by a mineral
acid and
