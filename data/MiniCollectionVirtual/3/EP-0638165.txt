<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method 
for detecting particles in a gas flow. The invention is 
particularly concerned with an arrangement in which 
particles are detected as a result of those particles 
triboelectrically charging a probe in a duct along which 
a gas flows. WO 86/02454 describes an apparatus which uses 
triboelectric effects. A metal probe projects into a 
duct and particles carried past the probe in the gas flow 
impart triboelectric charges to the probe. Those charges 
are conducted to ground through an electric circuit, 
resulting in an electric current. The current is 
converted to a unipolar voltage and amplified to provide 
an indication of the mass of the particles. In WO 86/02454 an auto-zero circuit is preferably 
provided to rezero the circuit periodically (about once 
per minute) in order to prevent the output of the circuit 
varying with ambient temperature as a result of changing 
electrical characteristics of the current to voltage 
conversion circuit. As an alternative to the auto-zero 
circuit a system which uses only the a.c. component of 
the signal can be used apparently for the same purpose. 
In commercial versions of the apparatus described in 
WO 86/02454, the auto-zero circuit is employed. We have found that apparatus of the kind described  
 
in WO 86/02454 is unable to give a reliable indication 
of the mass flow rate of particles in the gas flow and 
that the magnitude of the current generated by the 
charges is influenced by factors other than the mass of 
the particles. US 4,179,934 relates to a method and apparatus for 
monitoring particles in a gas flow in which particles are 
separated into two separate streams and the ratio of 
signals obtained from a probe in each stream is used to 
obtain an indication of the particle size. It is an object of the invention to provide a method 
and apparatus for detecting particles in a gas flow which 
relies upon particles in the flow triboelectrically 
charging a probe and which is less affected by changes in 
other variables relating to the gas flow. According to the invention there is provided a 
method for detecting particles flowing in a gas flow along a stack and 
emitted through the stack, according to claim 1. 
The term 
"gas flow related variables" refers to variables that are 
related to the environment in the region of the gas flow 
and at the probe, to the gas flow itself and/or to the  
 
particles in the gas flow. Examples of gas flow related 
variables other than those relating to particle
