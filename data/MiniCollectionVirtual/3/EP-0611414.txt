<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to friction rock 
stabilisers and particularly to friction rock stabilisers 
for forced insertion thereof into an undersized bore in an 
earth structure, such as a mine roof or wall. One type of friction rock stabiliser uses a slit along its 
length to provide compressibility. The use of slitted friction rock stabilisers to stabilise 
the rock layers in the roofs and walls of mines, tunnels 
and other excavations is well known. In application, these 
devices provide the benefit of relatively easy installation 
and a tight grip, which grows stronger with time and as 
rock shifts. A problem associated with these prior art 
stabilisers is that their weight and bulk contribute to 
manufacturing and shipping costs, and also can cause 
handling problems underground. Also such stabilisers, if 
made from carbon steel, can be subject to corrosion over 
time. EP-A-0 182 777 discloses a friction rock stabiliser in the 
form of an S-shaped nail which is radially resilient, two 
substantially semicircular flanks being arranged 
symmetrically about a central web and being compressible 
when driven in a rock hole. US-A-4 666 345 discloses a hollow rock bolt which has a 
radial, transverse polygonal cross-section with resilient 
sides to which external fins are joined for contacting the 
sides of a rock hole. The fins are forced inwardly to 
deflect the sides of the polygon.  
 According to the present invention, there is provided a 
friction rock stabiliser, for use in a borehole of the type 
having a longitudinal centre axis and a substantially 
circular cross section transverse to said centre axis, the 
stabiliser comprising an elongate nondeformable centre 
spine having a top end and a bottom end, said spine being 
adapted to extend within said borehole adjacent to said 
axis, and support arm means extending longitudinally along 
said spine, characterised in that said support arms extend 
transversely outwardly from said spine for exerting a 
radial force outwardly from said centre axis towards a 
borehole wall, for urging at least three spaced-apart 
friction surfaces into contact with the borehole wall, said 
friction surfaces having therebetween a portion of said 
spine spaced from the borehole wall, when said stabiliser 
is positioned within the borehole; said friction surfaces 
being positioned on an arc of a circle measured around said 
centre axis, said arc spanning a centre angle of at least 
180 degrees, and there being compression means on said 
support arm means for

A friction rock stabiliser (1), for use in a borehole 
of the type having a longitudinal centre axis and a 

substantially circular cross section transverse to said 
centre axis, the stabiliser comprising an elongate 

nondeformable centre spine (7) having a top end (3) and a 
bottom end (5), said spine being adapted to extend within 

said borehole adjacent to said axis, and support arm means 
(11) extending longitudinally along said spine, 

characterised in that said support arms (11) extend 
transversely outwardly from said spine (7) for exerting a 

radial force outwardly from said centre axis towards a 
borehole wall, for urging at least three spaced-apart 

friction surfaces (13) into contact with the borehole wall, 
said friction surfaces having therebetween a portion of 

said spine spaced from the borehole wall, when said 
stabiliser is positioned within the borehole; said friction 

surfaces being positioned on an arc of a circle measured 
around said centre axis, said arc spanning a centre angle 

of at least 180 degrees, and there being compression means 
(17) on said support arm means (11) for permitting 

resilient compression of said support arm means, and for 
transmitting compressive stress in a radial direction 

between said friction surfaces (13) and said spine during 
insertion of said stabiliser into an undersized borehole. 
A stabiliser according to claim 1, in which said 
support arm means (11) comprises a support arm (15) 

extending between each of said friction surfaces (13) and 
said spine (7). 
A stabiliser according to claim 1 or 2, in which said 
compression means (17) is provided by at least one of said  

 
support arms being resiliently deformable upon insertio
n of 
said stabiliser into an undersized borehole. 
A stabiliser according to claim 3, in which at least 
one of said deformable support arms includes an angular 

elbow portion (17) at which resilient deformation can 
occur. 
A stabiliser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which said circle on which said friction 

surfaces (13) are positioned has a diameter larger than the 
diameter of the borehole, when said stabiliser is outside 

of the borehole; and has a diameter equal to the diameter 
of the borehole, when said stabiliser is within the 

borehole. 
A stabiliser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which said support arm means (11) adjacent said 

top end (3) of said spine (7) has a tapered end. 
A stabiliser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which said bottom end (5) of said spine has a 

flange (9) affixed thereto. 
A stabiliser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which said spine includes a reinforcing member 

(51) in the central portion thereof extending along the 
length of said spine and being positioned entirely within 

said spine. 
A stabiliser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which said friction surfaces (13) are spaced 

apart from each other by a centre angle of substantially 
120 degrees.  

 
A stabiliser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which said stabiliser is provided from a 

lightweight and non-corrosive material selected from a 
group consisting essentially of aluminum and high strength 

plastics. 
A stabiliser according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which said spine and said support arm means have 

different and independently variable longitudinal tensile 
strength and compressive strength characteristics.
