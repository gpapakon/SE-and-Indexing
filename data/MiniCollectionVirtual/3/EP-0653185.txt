an expiration blowing part(2) provided with a non-airtight 

mask(4) is connected to a forward end surface of 
a syringe(24) through a two-way on-off electromagnetic 

valve(20), while an expiration transmission passage(28) 
communicating with a sample outlet(12) is also connected 

to the forward end surface of the syringe(24). A two-way 
on-off electromagnetic valve(26) is provided in the 

expiration transmission passage(28), and an O₂ sensor(30) 
is provided between the electromagnetic valve(26) and the 

sample outlet(12) as a standard gas sensor. The

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an expiration
collector for collecting expiration from a subject as a
sample, for analyzing the expiration sample in an
analyzer such as a gas chromatograph.A clinical test for diagnosing, curing or preventing
a disease is generally made on blood or urine. On the
other hand, expiration is employed in the laboratory
level as a specimen for a clinical biochemical test other
than those for blood and urine, leading to such
recognition that expiration also includes information as
to a disease. The expiration test has such an advantage
that the expiration can be collected at any time in a
painless manner.Methods of collecting a specimen of expiration for
measuring components of the expiration specimen by an
analyzer such as a gas chromatograph are roughly
classified into three types, i.e., a chemical trap method 
of blowing expiration into a solvent for dissolving the
former in the latter, a cold trap method of blowing a
large amount of expiration into a cold trap which is
cooled to about -80 °C, for example, for condensing the
same, and an adsorption trap method of adsorbing
expiration components to an adsorption trap which is
charged with activated carbon or adsorption resin
(Scientific American, July 1992, pp. 52 - 57). Among
these, the cold trap method and the adsorption trap
method have already been put into practice.In the cold trap method, the sample as trapped is
generally partially injected into a gas chromatograph
through a micro syringe, to be subjected to analysis.
However, it is extremely difficult to put this method
into practice as clinical test means for a hospital
routine which must be quickly and readily carried out
while bringing the analyzer into the bedside of a patient.In the adsorption trap method, expiration components
which are adsorbed by the trap are heated and desorbed to
be introduced into a gas chromatograph. However, this
method is not suitable for a clinical test for a routine
which must be quickly and readily carried out while
bringing the analyzer into the bedside of a patient
either, in addition to such an essential problem that
adsorptivity of the adsorption trap is varied with the 
components.In expiration which is subjected to analysis, an
initial part containing air from a dead space is
eliminated so that a part called end-tidal air is most
suitably employed as a sample for the analyzer. The end-tidal
air, which contains only alveolar air with
homogeneous concentration of expiration components, is
excellent as a specimen. In an expiration
