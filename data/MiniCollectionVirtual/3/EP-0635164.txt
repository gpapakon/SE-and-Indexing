<DESCRIPTION>
 SAMPLE INTRODUCING APPARATUS AND SAMPLE MODULES FOR MASS SPECTROMETERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a sample introducing interface system defined by a sample introducing apparatus and sample modules connectable therewith for direct analysis and measurement of volatile and partially volatile organics or organic compounds obtainable from various environmental matrices in mass spectrometers. This invention was made with the support of the United States Government under contract No. DE-AC05-84OR21400 awarded by the U. S. Department of Energy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.The analysis and measurement of trace levels of volatile and partially volatile organics and organic compounds in environmental matrices such as air, water, and soil has been achieved by employing direct sampling mass spectrometry. Such monitoring of environmental matrices is becoming of increasing interest due to environmental pollution concerns. In direct sampling mass spectrometry, a sample of the organic or organic compound in gaseous form is directly inserted into the high vacuum region of the mass spectrometer without first undergoing sample preparation such as provided by the use of gas chromatography or other sample separating procedures. By directly introducing a sample into the high vacuum region of the mass spectrometer, the response time for the analysis of the sample is substantially instantaneous with the analysis providing an accurate quantification of target analytes. In direct sampling mass spectrometry, the individual organics or organic compounds are analyzed by using one or more techniques such as spectra subtraction, selective chemical ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry.Mass spectrometers useful in the practice of direct sampling mass spectrome¬ try are presently commercially available and include ion trap mass spectrometers such as provided by Finnigan MAT Corporation, San Jose, California, 95134-1991. Ion trap mass spectrometers are provided with vacuum chambers which are pumped to high vacuum with one or more turbomolecuiar pumps. The vacuum chamber and the analyzer cell within the mass spectrometer are preferably maintained at a constant temperature of about 120°C to help minimize the absorption of contaminants on exposed surfaces in the mass spectrometer. The ion trap mass spectrometers are preferably equipped with the necessary hardware and software for performing electron 

impact, chemical ionization, selective ion ejection, and collision
