<ABSTRACT>
Nanosols and process for preparing the same allow colloidally dispersed solutions of scarcely water-soluble active substances to be stabilised with gelatine or its derivates, by partly or fully setting the iso-ionic point (IIP, equivalent to a neutral charge) between the gelatine and the surface charged active substance particles. In order to neutralise the charge of the system composed of active substance particles and gelatine, the surface charge of the particles is compensated by a corresponding opposite charge of the gelatine molecules. For that purpose, a determined charge in relation to the isoelectric point (IEP) and the pH value of the solution is set on the gelatine molecules. By stabilising in this way the practically monodispersed state thus generated, the Ostwald maturation of the colloidal particles of scarcely soluble active substance is strongly reduced. A new form of pharmaceutical administration having new properties can thus be obtained with generally scarcely water-soluble anorganic and organic compounds, in particular medicaments with a problematic bioavailability. Prefered medicaments are glibenclamide and 3-indolylacetic acid derivates, such as indometacin or acemetacin.
