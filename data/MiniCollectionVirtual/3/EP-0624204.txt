<ABSTRACT>
A machine for forming the taphole of a tank furnace in order to apply the lost rod method. The machine includes a housing (20), a drive (42, 44), and a clamp (34) for coupling the drive to the rod (26) while it is being withdrawn. A pusher (34) imparts a pushing force to the rear end of the rod (26) while it is being inserted into the taphole clay. Meanwhile, intermediate guides (55i) surround the rod (26) at several points and are successively placed in a position in which they do not hinder the advance of said pusher (34, 78) on the housing (20).

Machine for piercing a taphole for a shaft furnace, 
comprising 


a mounting (20) for supporting either a piercing rod 
(26) or a drill bit (27), the said mounting (20) comprising 

a front end which may be arranged facing the taphole and a 
rear end axially opposite the front end, 
a drilling apparatus (32) with a coupling (30) which is 
designed to receive and rotationally drive the drill bit 

(27), the said drilling apparatus (32) being mounted so as 
to slide on the mounting (20), 
a drive means (42, 44) mounted on the mounting (20) so 
as to develop a traction force or thrust force 

respectively, parallel to the mounting (20), 
a clamp (34) mounted on the mounting (20) between the 
front end of the latter and the drilling apparatus (32) and 

connected to the drive means (42, 40), the said clamp (34) 
comprising a body (75) which is traversed axially by a 

channel (74) which has a diameter slightly greater than the 
rod (26) and the drill bit (27), and movable jaws (70, 72) 

which are arranged around the channel (74) as to be able to 
grip the rear end of the rod (26) engaged in the channel 

(74) in order to transmit to it a large traction force when 
the clamp (34) is moved in the direction of the rear end of 

the mounting (20), 
 
   characterized 


in that the clamp (34) can be moved by the said drive 
means (42, 44) along the mounting (20) over a length which 

corresponds approximately to the length of the rod (26), 
in that a key (78) can be engaged in a housing (76) in 
the body (75) of the clamp (34) so as to block the channel 

(74) axially and to be able to transmit, to the rear end of 
the rod (26) engaged in the channel (74), an axial thrust 

force when the clamp (34) is moved in the direction of the 
front end of the mounting (20),  

 
in that the said key (78), when it is withdrawn from 
its housing (76), frees the channel (74) in the clamp (34) 

so as to be able to pass through this channel (74) with the 
drill bit (27) and to couple the latter to the coupling 

(30) of the drilling apparatus (32) located between the 
clamp (34) and the rear end of the mounting (20), 
in that intermediate guides (55i) are mounted on the 
mounting (20) between the front end of the latter and the 

clamp (34), the said guides (55i) having, on the mounting, 
operating positions in which they surround the rod (26) at 

several axially spaced-apart places during its insertion 
into the taphole blocked beforehand with the taphole clay, 

and parked positions in which they do not hinder the 
advance of the said clamp (34) towards the front end of the 

mounting (20), and 
in that these intermediate guides (55i) are capable of 

moving, as the clamp (34) advances towards the front end of 
the mounting (20), from the said operating positions into 

the said parked positions. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the said guides (55i) can slide on the mounting. 
Machine according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the said intermediate guides (55i) are mounted on the 

mounting (20) so as to be pushed by the said clamp (34) 
from their initial operating position to a parked position 

at the front of the mounting, as the said clamp (34) 
advances towards the front of the mounting (20). 
Machine according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
each intermediate guide (55i) can be driven by the said 

drive means from the parked position at the front of the 
mounting (20) to its initial operating position, as the 

said clamp (34) retreats from the front towards the rear of 
the mounting (20). 
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the said intermediate guides (55i) 

consist of hooks (56), sliding on the mounting (20) and  
 

provided with a lateral notch enabling the rod (26) to be 
housed therein, and in that the said lateral notch is 

provided with a component (58) enabling it to be closed 
laterally after the rod (26) has been housed therein. 
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the said drive means mounted on the 

mounting (20) comprises at least one endless chain (44) 
installed on the mounting (20) and at least one drive motor 

(42) whose direction of rotation may be reversed. 
Machine according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the motor (42) is a hydraulic motor. 
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized 


in that the clamp (34) and the drilling apparatus (32) 
are supported by a common carriage (36) which can slide in 

rails (22, 24) of the mounting (20), and 
in that this carriage (36) is connected to the said 
drive means (42, 44).
