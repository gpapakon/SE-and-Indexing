<ABSTRACT>
The control system according to the invention is associated with an engine provided with means for measuring one or more parameters: pressures (in the cylinder, at intake, at exhaust) for each cylinder, accelerator, injector needle lift, detecting pinking or knocking, engine torque, etc., and with means for angular encoding of the crankshaft position. It includes a synchronisation assembly (7) interacting with means for angular discrimination, so as to reset automatically at every moment the angular encoding data with respect to the combustion cycles. An acquisition assembly digitises, at a high frequency, various data items measured and especially the values of the pressure taken during each cycle, simultaneously in all the cylinders. A processing assembly (18) especially comprising a fast digital processor suitable for determining in real time complex physical parameters such as indicated MEP (mean effective pressure) over each cycle or engine revolution, factors of stability of these parameters over time etc. The results obtained are applied to a control computer (19) designed to determine and optimise various parameters of the engine: fuel injection, ignition advance, etc. - Application to optimising two-stroke or four-stroke petrol or diesel engines.
