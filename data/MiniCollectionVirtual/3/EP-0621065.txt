<ABSTRACT>
In the process for separating or purifying substances by crystallisation from melts or highly concentrated solutions under elevated pressures, gas is dissolved in the crystallising melt which outgases again after crystallisation in the course of a pressure reduction. As a result, impurities which are still adhering or included are removed.

<CLAIMS>
A process for separating and purifying substances by
crystallization from melts or highly concentrated

solutions under high pressures, wherein

a) inert gas is dissolved in the crystallizing
melt at gas pressures from 50 to 5000 bar
b) the melt is crystallized at pressures of 50 to
5,000 bar and
c) the gas is expelled again after the crystallization
with reduction in the pressure, with the

result that still adhering or occluded impurities
are removed.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the melt
is subjected to pressure under a nitrogen, carbon

dioxide, ethane, ethene or propane atmosphere or an
atmosphere comprising mixtures thereof.
