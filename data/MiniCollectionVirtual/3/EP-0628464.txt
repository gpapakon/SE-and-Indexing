<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a handcart (trolley) (1) with at least one device (5) for putting the items to be transported on, with a pushing device (6), with a braking device (15) which acts on at least one of the rear castors (4) and with force-transmission means (22) which are connected in such a manner to the braking device (15) and to an actuating device (12) that by pivoting the actuating device (12) about a horizontal axis the braking forces, which act on at least one rear castor (4), can be changed in their intensity. The essence of the invention consists in the fact that the actuating device (12) is formed, in a manner known per se, by the pushing device (6), the horizontal axis which is provided for pivoting the actuating device (12) corresponding to the longitudinal axis (11) of the pushing device (6), and that the braking device (15), the pushing device (6) and the force-transmission means (22) are part of a control system (23) which acts hydraulically and has at least two hydraulic cylinders (16, 17) which are arranged on the handcart (1) outside the pushing device (6).
