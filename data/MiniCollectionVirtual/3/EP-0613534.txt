<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for, in a hydrostatic transmission having a preferably variable displacement hydraulic pump (P) feeding a number of hydraulic motors (M1, M2, M3, M4) provided in association with respective drive wheels, drive tracks or corresponding drive means, mutually balancing the flow of hydraulic fluid through the different hydraulic motors (M1-M4) by individually controlling of the flow from and/or to the same, whereby the individual flows of hydraulic fluid through the respective hydraulic motors (M1-M4) are detected and compared across respective restrictions (14, 15) being variable dependent on the total flow but being of mutually equal size and whereby, for optimum control or balancing, the detected differences in flow through the different hydraulic motors are in themselves used directly for the balancing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to hydrostatic transmissions and 
more specifically relates to a method and a flow control valve 
assembly for achieving mutual balancing of flows through 
consumers or working apparatuses in hydrostatic transmissions, 
of the kind indicated in the preambles of claims 1 and 5 respectively. Hydrostatic transmissions of the kind indicated in the introduction 
are especially employed for propelling special vehicles, 
such as cross-country vehicles and other slow moving vehicles, 
whereby the drive motor, for instance a combustion engine or an 
electric motor, of the vehicle is employed for driving one or 
more hydraulic pumps which usually are of the kind having a 
variable displacement. The flow from the hydraulic pump/pumps 
drive hydraulic motors which directly or through a gear-box 
drives wheels or (caterpillar) tracks of the vehicle. One problem that has to be solved in connection with such 
vehicles is that, on the one hand, the drive wheels or tracks of 
the vehicle must be permitted to rotate with different speeds, 
in order for the wheels or tracks to be able to cover distances 
of different lengths during the same time, and simultaneously 
must be able to transmit equal drive power, for instance when the 
vehicle is turning, and that, on the other hand, the drive wheels 
or tracks must not be allowed to slip due to a lower load or a 
lower coefficient of friction against the ground surface. Due to 
the varying nature of the ground or road surface a maximum 
tractive force is obtained which is equal to the number of wheels 
or tracks multiplied with the tractive force obtained from the 
wheel or track being able to transmit the lowest tractive force. 
By vehicles having gear-transmission this problem is solved by 
means of a differential gear having a differential lock which may 
be engaged and disengaged. The hydrostatic transmission does not 
require any equivalent to the differential, but in order to 
obtain maximum tractive force for each separate wheel or track,  
 
a mutual controlling or balancing of the hydraulic flows of the 
motors at the respective wheels or tracks must achieved. An obvious solution is to provide the vehicle with a hydraulic 
pump feeding each hydraulic motor, but this solution is employed 
very seldom today due to the coherent large requirement for 
space, high cost and obvious control problems. An alternative, previously known solution is to supplement the 
hydraulic system of the vehicle with some kind of flow regulating 
hydraulic
