<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of
co-polymers of carbon monoxide with one or more compounds
comprising an ethylenically unsaturated bond.It is known that co-polymers of carbon monoxide and one or
more ethylenically unsaturated compounds, in which co-polymers the
units originating from carbon monoxide substantially alternate with
the units originating from the ethylenically unsaturated compounds,
may be prepared by reacting the monomers under polymerization
conditions in the presence of a suitable catalyst.According to EP-181014 the preparation of these co-polymers
can be carried out in the liquid phase, i.e. such that the
continuous phase is formed by a liquid diluent, usually a
non-polymerizable liquid, such as methanol, in which the catalyst
dissolves, but the formed co-polymers are substantially insoluble.
The preparation of the co-polymers may also proceed in the gas
phase, whereby the continuous phase is formed by gaseous carbon
monoxide and possibly one or more of the other monomers, if they
are present in the gas phase under the prevailing polymerization
conditions. A process for the gas phase manufacture of linear
alternating co-polymers is described in EP-248483.It is considered that, in comparison with the liquid phase
preparation of co-polymers of carbon monoxide and one or more
ethylenically unsaturated compounds, there is merit in the
preparation of such co-polymers in the gas phase, because the
isolation and purification of the product which - in liquid phase
operation of the process - normally requires a filtration or
centrifugation step, is facilitated. Since these steps involve
considerable costs when the process is carried out on a technical
scale, it is regarded as a major advantage when such isolation and
purification steps can be omitted. In the known embodiments of the co-polymerization
process i.e. both in embodiments carried out in the
liquid phase and in those carried out in the gas phase,
usually a catalyst system is applied which is based on a
compound of a metal from Group VIII of the Periodic
Table, an anion of an acid with a pKa of less than 2,
with the exception of hydrohalogenic acids, and a
bidentate ligand. It is believed that when using such a
catalyst system in a liquid phase operation of the
process, polymerization will only occur when an anion
originating from the liquid diluent (usually a lower
alcohol such as methanol) has been incorporated in the
catalyst system. It is further believed that with these
catalyst systems also in gas phase
