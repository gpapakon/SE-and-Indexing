<ABSTRACT>
A trigger device (21) is provided with a firing 
pin (22) made of a non-magnetic material and arranged 

movably toward a detonator (10), an inertia body (23) 
formed of a permanent magnet and arranged movably 

toward the detonator (10), and a cylindrical permanent 
magnet (24) having an inner diameter greater than an 

outer diameter of the inertia body (23). The firing 
pin (22) extends freely through the inertia body (23). 

When an acceleration acting on the inertia body (23) 
exceeds repulsion between the inertia body (23) and the 

cylindrical permanent magnet (24), the inertia body 
(23) is caused to move toward the detonator (10) 

through a cavity of the cylindrical permanent magnet 
(24) so that the firing pin (22) strikes and fires the 

detonator. An attracting disk (25) made of a magnetic 
material is arranged in close contact with a detonator-side 

magnetic pole surface of the cylindrical permanent 
magnet (24) so that attraction for the inertia body 

(23) is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement in a trigger device 
for actuating a webbing tightener adapted to rotate a take-up 
spindle of a retractor in a webbing wind-in direction in the 
event of a collision of a vehicle or an air bag system for 
protecting an occupant from impact by an air bag promptly inflated 
with gas in the event of a collision. The document EP-A-0 591 685 falling under Article 54(3) describes 
a starting device adapted to strike a detonator in 
response to an acceleration higher than a predetermined value 
to activate a gas generator, which comprises an ignition pin 
adapted to move towards said detonator to collide with said 
detonator thereby to ignite said detonator, an inertial body 
made of a permanent magnet for supplying kinetic energy to 
said ignition pin and an annular permanent magnet the inside 
diameter of which is larger than the outside diameter of said 
inertial body, said inertial body being moved towards said 
detonator when the force of inertia of said inertial body becomes 
greater than a magnetic repulsion force between said 
annular permanent magnet and said inertial body.  
 To protect an occupant in the event of an emergency 
such as a vehicular collision, passive restraint 
systems such as a webbing tightener and an air bag system 
have found wide-spread utility in recent years. The webbing tightener comprises, for example, a 
pulley rotatably mounted on a take-up spindle of a 
retractor, a cable wound on the pulley, and a piston 
connected to a free end of the cable and slidably 
received within a cylinder. Pressure of expanded gas 
is caused to act on the piston so that a thrust is produced. 
This thrust then applies a tension to the 
cable, whereby the cable drives the take-up spindle of 
the retractor in a webbing winding direction, that is,  
 
in a webbing take-up direction. As a consequence, the 
webbing applied on an occupant is taken up in the event 
of an emergency. The webbing tightener is therefore 
provided with a gas generator for supplying gas pressure 
so that the gas pressure acts on the piston within 
the cylinder to apply a tension to the cable. This gas 
generator includes a detonating heater and an explosive. 
By a signal from a collision sensor, the 
detonating heater is energized and the resulting heat 
of the detonating heater detonates the explosive to 
generate gas. The air bag system is accommodated, for example, 
in a steering wheel as a module, which is constructed 
of a center pad, a folded air bag, an inflator (gas 
generator)
