<ABSTRACT>
To reduce the space requirement and optimize the mode of operation, the control unit in a control apparatus for burners of heating installations or the like controls the oil preheater, the fan and the oil pump in such a way that not all these consumers are supplied with energy at the same time; on the contrary, the oil preheater is switched off again temporally in sequence before at least one drive unit for the fan or oil pump. The consumers can be operated at low voltage, which helps to reduce the power rating of the supply unit of an automatic firing system, for which reason it is also advisable to equip the fan on the one hand and the oil pump on the other hand with drive units controllable independently of one another, in particular 35 V DC motors.

<CLAIMS>
A control device for burners of heating installations or the 
like having a fuel line in which an oil pump (6), an oil preheater (5) and 

a fuel valve (7) are fitted, an air feed conduit in which a fan (8) is 
fitted, a drive unit (D6, D8) for the oil pump and for the fan, a switch 

device for the fuel valve, an ignition unit (10) for the burner and a 
control unit (2) for controlling the drive units, the oil preheater, the 

switch device and the ignition unit, and an electrical voltage supply (1) 
for the drive unit, the oil preheater, the ignition unit, the switch 

device and the control unit, characterised in that the control unit (2) 
switches on the fan (8) and/or the oil pump (6) by way of their drive 

units (D6, D8) only after the oil preheater (5) has been switched off. 
A control device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
control unit (2) switches on the fan (8) immediately after the oil 

preheater (5) has been switched off. 
A control device according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised 
in that the oil pump (6) and the fan (8) each have their own drive unit 

(D6, D8). 
A control device according to claim 3 characterised in that dc 
motors of a voltage of less than 50 V are used for the drive units (D6, 

D8). 
A control device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the drive members (D6, D8) are controlled in a pulse 

width-modulated manner. 
A control device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the control unit (2) has a microprocessor (MC) which 

delimits the switch-on phases of the oil preheater (5) on the one hand and 
the other units on the other hand from each other in a time-programmed 

manner.
