<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an airbag container, especially a container (1) for a passenger seat airbag and a device for fastening the said airbag container to a transverse support (4) which is part of the vehicle structure and is situated beneath the dashboard of a motor vehicle. The invention is intended to achieve fastening of the airbag container which is particularly simple and stable. This is achieved by means of supports (7) which are moulded onto the container (1) and engage with pins (9) in apertures (10) of the transverse support (14) and by means of contact surfaces (11) on the container (1) which are supported on the transverse support (4). Screws (13) effect the fixed connection. Intermediate layers (17 and 18) span tolerances and prevent oscillations. The container (1) is preferably manufactured from a light metal or plastic using the injection moulding method.
