<ABSTRACT>
A plate-fin heat exchanger 10 is disclosed including 
a plurality of flat pipes 14 interleaved with a plurality of 

fin members 16. The flat pipes 14 are formed from a 
plurality of plate members 12. The heat exchanger 10 also 

includes a plurality of fin members 16 and a pair of fluid 
manifolds 22, 24. The manifolds 22, 24 engage the heat 

exchanger 10 along either of two axes which are 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tank 20 of the 

heat exchanger 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat
exchanger for an automotive vehicle comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1. Such a heat exchanger is known, for example, from US-A-4 487 038.In these types of heat exchangers, a plurality of elongated
plates are joined together, such as through a lamination
process to define a plurality of passageways for the
movement of a fluid there through. Each of the passageways
is formed by the inwardly facing surfaces of a pair of
joined plates so as to form a flat pipe. The interior
surfaces of the joined plates generally define a central
fluid conducting section. The passageways are
interconnected so that a fluid may flow through the
plurality of joined plates forming the heat exchanger. As
is also known in the art, conductive fin strips are located
between outwardly facing surfaces of the pairs of joined
plates. Heat exchangers of this type have particular
utility as evaporators for air conditioning systems of motor
vehicles.Typically, plate-fin heat exchangers are manufactured
by stacking a plurality of individual plates together to
form a flat pipe and interleaving fin members between each
pipe. An inlet and outlet manifold are then inserted
between a pair of pipes to provide for fluid communication
into and out of the evaporator. End sheets are then placed
on opposite ends of the heat exchanger to form a heat
exchanger core and the core is brazed in a furnace to
complete the manufacturing process.Various types of manifold designs have been proposed
for use in a plate-fin type heat exchanger. One such manifold design is described in US Patent No
4 967 834 which relates to a heat exchanger for an
automotive vehicle. The heat exchanger includes a core
formed from tubular elements and tanks at the ends of the
tubular elements. Manifolds are provided to introduce a
cooling medium and discharge it from the heat exchanger, the
manifolds being designed to include a head portion that is
eccentrically arranged relative to a body portion. The
manifold design provides for the manifold to be kept within
the boundary line of the heat exchanger so as to minimize
the size of casing needed to accomodate the heat exchanger.
The manifold is arranged in a fixed orientation with respect
to the exchanger.US Patent No 5 125 453 describes a heat exchanger
structure for an automotive vehicle comprising a plurality
of flat pipes arranged parallel to and in fluid
communication with one another for allowing the flow of a
heat exchange fluid there through. Each of said flat pipes
