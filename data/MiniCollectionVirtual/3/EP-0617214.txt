<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a compact angular gearing with as large a transmission range as possible with, at the same time, a constant crown-gear diameter and a constant offset of the axis, in which the pinion (4) is supported only at a bearing location (7) remote from the gearwheel (6) and the pinion (4) is designed as a hollow shaft and can be connected frictionally to an engine shaft of a driving engine so as to rotate with it.

Axis-displaced angular gear with a large axis displacement, with a driven 
side wheel (6) provided with a tooth system on a front end and with a pinion 

engaging therewith, the pinion (4) being constructed as a hollow shaft with a 
hollow shaft portion and is connectable frictionally and in non-rotary manner 

to a motor shaft (8) of a drive motor, the hollow shaft portion of the pinion 
(4) only being mounted at a bearing point (7) remote from the toothed wheel 

(6) and which is located in a bearing plate (8), attachable to the motor and 
connected in one piece to a housing of the gear and a bearing (14) of the 

bearing point for the pinion (4) is held positively on the gear housing (3). 
Gear according to claim 1, characterized in that the passage of the hollow 
shaft portion of the pinion (4) towards the gear interior is sealed by a 

radial shaft seal (22). 
Gear according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
bearing (14) for the hollow shaft portion of the pinion (4) is axially held 

in the gear housing (3) between a shoulder (13) of the latter facing the 
toothed wheel (6) and a spring clip (17) inserted on the opening side in a 

groove (16) in the gear housing (3). 
Gear according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
hollow shaft portion of the pinion (4) is held in axially fixed manner in the 

bearing (14). 
Gear according to claim 4, characterized in that the hollow shaft portion 
of the pinion (4) is axially held on the gear side by means of a shoulder 

(18), optionally accompanied by the interposing of a back-up washer (21a), 
and on the motor side by means of a groove (19) formed therein and a spring 

clip to be fitted in the groove. 
Gear according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
gear housing (3) is symmetrically constructed with respect to the bearing 

points in the direction of the axis (A) of the toothed wheel (6) perpendicular 
to the axis (R) of the pinion (4). 
Gear according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that in  
 

the gear housing (3), in the direction of the axis (A) of the toothed wheel 
(6) perpendicular to the axis (R) of the pinion (4) are symmetrically provided 

bearing points for bearings (36, 37) for the mounting of a shaft (26, 
26a, 71) for the toothed wheel (6). 
Gear according to claim 7, characterized in that in the gear housing are 
formed grooves (42), in which engage spring clips (43) for the axial fixing 

of the bearings (36, 37). 
Gear according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
gear housing (3) is provided with fastening elements for flanges (51, 51a). 
Gear according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
shaft (26, 27a, 71) of the toothed wheel (6) is stepped, the largest diameter 

being in a central part (27, 27a) in the vicinity of the axis (R) of the 
pinion (4). 
Gear according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
toothed wheel (6) is axially held on a reduced diameter, support area (28) 

between a shoulder (29) of the shaft (26, 26a), a bearing (36) and by adhesion. 
Gear according to claim 9, characterized in that on providing a flange 
(51), the shaft (26a) is mounted on one side in the flange (51). 
Geared motor with an angular gear according to one of the claims 1 to 12 
and with an electric motor, characterized in that the motor (24) only has 

one motor bearing for the motor shaft (8). 
Geared motor according to claim 13, characterized in that the sole motor 
bearing of the motor (24) is located on the side remote with respect to the 

gear.
