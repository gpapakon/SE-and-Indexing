<ABSTRACT>
Programming method for the computer-controlled internal electrical connection of a field-programmable logic array comprising an at least two-dimensional arrangement of logic blocks (31) which can be connected to one another and to the surroundings by means of internal electrical connections which can be freely specified by the user. Internal electrical configurations, that is to say connections and optionally logic functions as well, of the logic array are determined from a predetermined overall functional behaviour, for example on account of a predetermined functional circuit diagram, in particular a function diagram for a programmable controller. These configurations implement the predetermined overall functional behaviour. The internal electrical configurations, that is to say connections and optionally the logic functions as well, determined in this way are impressed upon the logic array and, irrespective of the predetermined overall functional behaviour, some of the internal electrical connections, which can in principle be freely specified, are permanently predetermined when the internal electrical connections are being specified.

<CLAIMS>
A programming method for the computer-controlled
internal electrical connection of a field-programmable

gate array comprising an at least two-dimensional
arrangement of logic blocks (31) which can be connected

to one another and to the environment by means of
internal electrical connections freely definable by the

user

wherein, from a predetermined overall functional
performance characteristic, for example on the

basis of a predetermined functional circuitry plan,
in particular a function plan for a stored-program

controller, internal electrical configurations,
thus connections and optionally also logic

functions, of the gate array which implement the
predetermined overall functional performance

characteristic are defined,
wherein the thus defined internal electrical
configurations, thus connections and optionally

also logic functions, are impressed upon the gate
array,
wherein, independently of the predetermined overall
functional performance characteristic, upon the

establishment of the internal electrical
connections a part of the fundamentally freely

definable internal electrical connections is
permanently specified and
wherein the logic blocks (31) are divided into
groups (36) by the permanently specified part of

the internal electrical connections, which groups
(36) at least in part have the same configurations.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the predetermined overall functional performance

characteristic is split into sub-functions (84-100) 
which at least in part can each be implemented in a

group (36) of logic blocks (31).
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that for standard sub-functions (99, 100), in

particular complex standard sub-functions (99, 100),
internal electrical standard configurations, thus

connections and optionally also logic functions, can be
specified.
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the standard sub-functions (99, 100) can be

implemented by more than one group (36) of logic blocks
(31).
A method according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised
in that sub-functions (84-98) and standard sub-functions

(99, 100) which can be implemented in a group (36) of
logic blocks (31) are combined, provided the combination

can also be implemented in a group (36) of logic blocks
(31).
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that


the sub-functions (84-98) and/or the standard sub-functions
(99, 100) and/or the combination are

assigned to the groups (36) of logic blocks (31),
taking into consideration the permanently specified
internal electrical connections, the internal

electrical connections which interconnect the
groups (36) of logic blocks (31) to one another so

as to implement the predetermined overall
functional performance characteristic are

determined,
and the thus determined internal electrical
connections are impressed upon the gate array, 

preferably together with the permanently specified
internal electrical connectio
ns.
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in
that in the case of a gate array with long-range long

connections (32, 33) and short-range short connections
(35), the electrical connections to process inputs and

process outputs take place at least in part via the long
connections (32, 33).
A method according to Claim 6 or 7, characterised
in that in a gate array with long-range long connections

(32, 33) and short-range short connections (35), the
internal electrical connections take place as far as

possible via the short-connections (35) and only those
internal electrical connections which cannot be

implemented via the short-connections (35) take place
via the long connections (32, 33).
A method according to Claim 8, characterised in
that the long connections (32, 33) are partially

interruptible and that the internal electrical
connections take place via the non-interruptible long

connections (32, 33) only when the internal electrical
connections cannot be implemented via the interruptible

long connections (32, 33).
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the overall functional performance

characteristic is specified in a programming language
for stored program controllers.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the overall functional performance

characteristic is specified in a graphic programming
language.
