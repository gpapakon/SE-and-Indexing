<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an endoscopic 
sheath 10 for protecting and/or changing an angle of view 

of an endoscope. The sheath has a distal portion 22 
configured to engage a distalmost portion of an endoscope 

imaging optics. The distal portion houses structure 24 for 
changing the angle of view of an endoscope. In a preferred 

embodiment, this structure includes a prism. The distal 
portion may additionally house structure for changing the 

angle of illumination of an illumination portion of an 
endoscope. This structure may be a prism 52 or a curved 

light guide or at least one angled optical fiber. Both the 
structure for changing the angle of view of an endoscope 

and the optical member for changing the angle of 
illumination of an endoscope may be positioned within the 

distal portion to align with the respective imaging or 
illumination elements of the endoscope.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to accessories for endoscopes 
and, more particularly, to endoscope sheaths which change 
an angle of view of an endoscope. Endoscopes have long been used in surgery to view 
internal portions of a patient's body from a narrow 
incision in the body exterior or through a naturally 
occurring hollow viscus. Endoscopes used for this purpose 
are long, slender instruments having a shaft which is 
either rigid or flexible, depending upon the procedure 
being performed. In general, endoscopes include an 
objective lens positioned adjacent a distal end, and an 
image transmission system which may include a fiber optic 
bundle, relay rods or lenses, or a solid state sensor to 
transmit the image to the viewer. Endoscopes also are 
usually equipped with an illumination system, such as a 
fiber optic bundle, which illuminates the area being 
imaged. Generally, a camera adapter is provided at the 
proximal end of the endoscope to permit the image to be 
displayed on a monitor for viewing by the entire surgical 
team. It is also known to provide a fluid and/or gas 
conduit which permits the surgeon to clean the distal-most 
imaging lens and/or clear the region in front of the 
distal-most lens for optical viewing. See, for example, 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,667,656; 4,770,163; and 4,838,246. Most endoscopes used for medical procedures have a 
fixed forward viewing angle. Different areas of the body 
can be imaged by changing the position of the endoscope or,  
 
in the case of flexible endoscopes, by bending the distal 
tip. In these endoscopes, the objective lens is disposed 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the instrument 
such that the area directly in front of the instrument is 
viewed by the user. Other configurations for endoscopes 
include side-viewing, and oblique angle of view endoscopes. In certain procedures, in addition to forward viewing 
endoscopes, it is desirable to have the capability for 
changing the angle of view during different stages of the 
procedure. For example, when examining the lining of a 
body cavity, e.g., esophagus, intestinal walls, it is 
advantageous to employ a side-viewing or oblique angle of 
view endoscope. Presently, the ability to view at different 
angles can only be accomplished by maintaining a variety of 
expensive high quality reusable side-viewing endoscopes. It is known in the art to provide attachments which 
change the angle of view of conventional reusable 
endoscopes. Typical devices of this type are disclosed in 
U.S. Patent Nos.
