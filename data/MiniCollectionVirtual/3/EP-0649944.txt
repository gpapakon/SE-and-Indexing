<ABSTRACT>
Described is a device (1) for eliminating unwanted vegetation (10) on paved surfaces by means of compressed air and a blasting medium. The device (1) is characterised in that there is provided a blasting pipe (2) which is connected to a compressed-air generator (12) and to a receptacle (16) for the blasting medium and at the jet nozzle (3) of which there is arranged a covering plate (4) which has a bowl-shaped rebounding space (5) which is open in the blasting direction and into which the jet nozzle (3) leads, and in that the rebounding space (5) is surrounded by a projecting covering edge (6) which, when the device (1) is in operation, lies on the ground (7) to be blasted. The device (1) enables good and quick removal of unwanted vegetation (10) in the gaps between stone slabs and the like.

A device (1) for the removal of unwanted plant growth (10) from paved 
areas by means of compressed air and an abrasive, wherein the device (1) is 

provided with a jet tube (2) which is connected to a compressed air generator (12) 
and a container (16) for the abrasive, with a cover hood (4) arranged on the jet 

nozzle (3) of the said jet tube (2), the said cover plate (4) being open in the 
direction of the jet stream and enveloped by a projecting cover edge (6) which lies 

on the ground (7) being treated during operation of the device (1), 
characterised 
in that
 the cover hood is in the form of a cover plate (4) and has a rebound area 
(5) in the region of which the cover plate (4) comprises a hard elastic material, with 

the depth of the rebound area (5) between 10% and 50% of the diameter of the 
rebound area (5), with the cover plate (4) arranged on the jet tube (2) so that it can 

pivot and the cover edge (6) made of a soft, elastic, pliable material, such that the 
device (1) can be used for the removal of plant growth (10) from joints (9) in the 

ground (7). 
A device (1) according to claim 1, characterised in that a wetting fluid is 
applied before or during operation. 
A device (1) according to claim 1 and claim 2, characterised in that the 
wetting fluid is fed to the jet nozzle (3) of the jet tube (2) via a feed line (25). 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the wetting fluid is water. 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that a herbicidal agent is added to the wetting fluid. 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that an adjustable air-inlet valve (19) is provided between the container (16) for  

 
the abrasive and the jet nozzle (3) of the jet tube (2), by means of which an 

abrasive line (17) can admit air such that the quantity of abrasive discharged from 
the jet nozzle (3) of the jet tube (2) can be altered. 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the jet tube (2) is portable and a lever (21) is provided on the jet tube (2) 

for adjustment of the air-inlet valve (19) arranged between the container (16) for 
the abrasive and the jet nozzle (3). 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that a valve (14) with a lever (15) is arranged on the jet tube (2) for adjustment 

of the volume of compressed air discharged from the jet nozzle (3). 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that a gate valve (18) is arranged between the container (16) for the abrasive 

and the jet nozzle (3) of the jet tube (2) to close off the abrasive line (17). 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that a lever (20) for actuation of the gate valve (18) is arranged on the jet tube 

(2). 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the feed line (25) for the wetting fluid between the jet tube (2) and a 

wetting fluid container (26) can be closed off by means of a valve (27). 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the compressed air generator (12), the container (16) for the abrasive and 

the container (26) for the wetting fluid are arranged on a movable platform (22). 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the jet nozzle (3) of the jet tube (2) opens centrally into the rebound area  

 
(5) of the cover plate (4). 
A device (1) according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the discharge opening (30) of the jet nozzle (3) of the jet tube (2) during
