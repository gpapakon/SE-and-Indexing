<ABSTRACT>
A displacement sensor provided with a magnet (4) and magnetoelectric conversion means for sensing the variation of magnetism 
caused by the magnet to sense the displacement of the magnetic material to be measured. The sensor is provided with a 

first magnetoelectric conversion means (5) located in the place where the magnetic flux density is varied by the displacement of 
the material to be measured, a second magnetoelectric conversion means (6) of the same kind as the first magnetoelectric conversion 

means (5), which is located in the place where the magnetic flux density is not varied by the displacement of the material to 
be measured, and a circuit means (10) for adding the outputs of the first and second magnetoelectric conversion means at a 

predetermined ratio. Further, by using the displacement sensor as a base and by adjusting the temperature coefficients of the first 
and second magnet
oelectric conversion means (5), (6), or by adjusting the temperature coefficient of the circuit means (10), the 
temperature compensation of the displacement sensor is so performed that its temperature coefficient approaches zero. Thereby, 

its sensing accuracy can be improved in a wide temperature range. The magnet (4), the first and second magnetoelectric conversion 
means (5), (6), and the circuit means (10) are contained in a case (21) having a heatinsulating structure so that the temperature 

in the case is kept constant independently of the temperature of the external environment. Optionally by using a case (21) of 
a material having a high thermal conductivity, the displacement sensor can respond at a high speed to the temperature of the external 

environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a displacement sensor
which comprises a magnet and magnetoelectric conversion
means for sensing the variation of magnetism caused by the
magnet, and senses the displacement of a magnetic material
to be measured, such as iron.Sensing the location of a magnetic material or magnet
by using magnetoelectric conversion elements such as Hall
elements or magnetic resistance elements has been a widely
practiced method, for example, in sensing the phase of a DC
brushless motor. However, even a GaAs Hall element, which
usually has a small temperature coefficient, has a
temperature coefficient of -0.06 %/ Â°C during constant-current
drive. Therefore, the displacement could not be
accurately sensed in a wide temperature range.In order to overcome this problem:
1) Japanese Patent No. 1094798 (Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 38073/1981) provides a compound
magnetoelectric conversion means which is composed of Hall 
elements and a temperature sensing element all closely
placed on a base material in the same pattern, and which is
thereby capable of performing excellent temperature
compensation even for local temperature variations in the
element itself.2) In Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
171879/1983, the variations of output voltage caused by the
temperature variations of the Hall elements are controlled
by forming compensation resistors in series on a base member.3) Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
248010/1989 is aimed at obtaining a high precision throttle
sensor that is independent of temperature variations, with
the polarities of the temperature coefficients of the
magnet and the Hall elements opposite to each other.Although the compound magnetoelectric conversion
elements described in 1) and 2) are excellent in temperature
compensation, the production of these compound
magnetoelectric conversion elements is difficult and costly.Furthermore, these compound magnetoelectric conversion
elements are not generally used, and therefore hard to come
by.In a displacement sensor comprising a permanent magnet
and magnetoelectric conversion elements as described in 1)
and 2), the surface magnetic flux density of the permanent
magnet itself has temperature characteristics, and therefore, 
compensensation only for the temperature characteristics of
the magnetoelectric conversion elements is not enough to
compensate for the temperature characteristics of the whole
displacement sensor.In the case of 3), the problem is the difficulty in
adjusting the temperature
