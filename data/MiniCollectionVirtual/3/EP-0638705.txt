<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses an anchor bolt fixing capsule consisting basically of (1) a main container having 
a sealed or liquid-tight structure, (2) a hardenable resin composition containing (meth)acrylic acid ester of epoxy 

resin and reactive monomer and held in the main container, both the ester and reactive monomer having a specific 
gravity equal to or not lower than that of sea-water, (3) a hardening agent for the hardenable resin composition which 

is provided relative to the main container and isolated from the hardenable resin composition, and which contains 
organic peroxide, and (4) a surface active agent provided relative to the container in the condition that the surface 

active agent is contained in the hardenable resin composition and hardening agent or isolated from these components. 
When the anchor bolt fixing capsule according to the present invention is used, an anchor bolt can be fixed stably 

and very firmly to a base material in the sea or water or to a base material around this base material. Moreover, the 
hardenable resin composition does not float on the surface of the sea, so that an anchor bolt fixing operation can be 

carried out safely without any risk of contaminating the ocean.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a capsule for use
in fixing an anchor bolt to a base, such as concrete, a
rock bed or the like. More particularly, the present
invention is concerned with a capsule for use in fixing
an anchor bolt, which comprises (A) a primary casing having a
sealed construction or having at least one opening which is closed by means of closure means to thereby provide a fluid-tight construction, the
primary casing being adapted to be breakable by the
action of an anchor bolt when the anchor bolt is driven
into the capsule, (B) a curable resin composition,
contained in the primary casing, comprising an epoxy acrylate
resin composed mainly of an ester of an epoxy resin with at least one organic acid selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid and
methacrylic acid, and a reactive monomer, wherein
each of the epoxy acrylate resin and the reactive
monomer has a specific gravity equal to or greater than
the specific gravity of sea water, and (C) a curing
agent for the curable resin composition, disposed in
association with the primary casing and in isolation from the
curable resin composition, wherein the curing agent
comprises an organic peroxide, characterized
in that the capsule further comprises (D) a surfactant,
which is contained in at least one member selected from
the group consisting of the curable resin composition
and the curing agent, or disposed in association with
the primary casing and separately from the curable resin composition
and the curing agent.Generally, in using a capsule comprising a casing, 
a curable resin composition contained therein, and a
curing agent disposed in isolation from the resin
composition, a hole is drilled in a base and the capsule
is inserted into the hole. Then, an anchor bolt
is driven into the hole. The capsule is broken by the
driven anchor bolt, thereby allowing the curable resin
composition to be reacted with the curing agent, so
that a cured resin is formed and the inserted anchor
bolt is fixed to the base. By virtue of the specific
construction of the capsule of the present invention,
wherein a surfactant is used in addition to a combination
of a curable resin composition and a curing agent
disposed in isolation from the curable resin composition,
and wherein each of the main components of the
curable resin composition has a specific gravity equal
to or greater than the specific gravity of sea water,
not only does it become possible to stably fix an
anchor bolt to a base located in sea water or water, or
to a base located on a
