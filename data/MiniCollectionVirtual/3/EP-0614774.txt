<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic radial tyre having a reduced running 
noise. The tyre has sidewall portions (3), each of 

which is provided on the inner surface of the 
airtight inner liner (IL) with a lining strip (9) 

made of a rubber composition having a loss tangent 
of from 0.15 to 0.25. The lining strip (9) has a 

radially inner edge (A) located at a radial height 
HL of from 0.20 to 0.30 times the tyre section 

height (H) and a radially outer edge (B) located at 
a radial height HU of from 0.70 to 0.85 times the 

tyre section height (H), and the lining strip (9) 
extends continuously from the inner edge (A) to the 

outer edge (B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic radial 
tyre and more particularly to an improvement in a 
tyre sidewall to reduce tyre running noise. Hitherto, in order to reduce the noise produced by 
a tyre during running, efforts were mainly to 
improve the tread pattern which is the region 
contacting the ground. Recently, however, such improvements have almost 
reached the limit, and it becomes very difficult to 
further reduce running noise by improving the tread 
pattern alone. For example, as shown in Table 1, which compares a 
low noise tyre having a well designed tread 
pattern and a tyre which has a smooth tread surface 
(no tread pattern is provided), the difference in 
noise level is very small. 
Tyre Patterned tyre Smooth tyre Noise level dB(A)7370 Tyre size 225/50R16 
Coasting speed for measuring the noise 60km/H As a result of studies made by the inventor, it was 
discovered that the sidewall portions of a tyre 
vibrate during running and the sidewall portions 
themselves produce noise, and that the vibrations 
of the sidewall portion are transmitted to the 
tread portion to excite the air in the tread 
grooves which produces a noise as air resonance 
noise. Accordingly, the inventor realized that it is very 
important to effectively reduce the running noise 
to reduce vibrations of the sidewall portions in 
addition to improving the tread pattern. A radial tyre according to the preamble of claim 1 
and having a rubber lining strip in the sidewall 
between the carcass plies and the inner liner is 
known, e.g. from DE-A-4026430. In this known tyre, 
however, the presence of the rubber lining strip is 
directed to improving the tyre durability in 
running in a deflated condition. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic radial tyre, in which  
 
vibrations of the sidewall portions are effectively 
damped to reduce the running noise. According to the present invention, a 
pneumatic radial tyre comprises a tread portion, a 
pair of bead portions with a bead core disposed 
therein, a pair of sidewall portions, a toroidal 
carcass having a carcass ply of radially arranged 
organic fibre cords extending between the bead 
portions and turned up around the bead cores, a 
bead apex made of hard rubber disposed between the 
main carcass portion and each turned up portion, a 
belt having two crossed belt plies disposed 
radially outside the carcass, and an airtight inner 
liner made of rubber covering the inside of the 
carcass, each of said sidewall portions being

A pneumatic radial tyre comprising a tread 
portion (2), a pair of bead portions (4) with a 

bead core (5) disposed therein, a pair of sidewall 
portions (3), a toroidal carcass (6) having a 

carcass ply of radially arranged organic fibre 
cords extending between the bead portions (4) and 

turned up around the bead cores (5), a bead apex 
(8) made of hard rubber disposed between the main 

carcass portion (6a) and each turned up portion 
(6b), a belt (7) having two crossed belt plies 

(7A,7B) disposed radially outside the carcass (6), 
and an airtight inner liner (IL) made of rubber 

covering the inside (10) of the carcass, each of 
said sidewall portions (3) being provided 

with a lining strip (9) of a rubber composition 
having a loss tangent of from 0.15 to 0.25, 

characterised in that the lining strip is provided 
on the inner surface of said airtight inner liner 

(IL) and has a radially inner edge (A) located at a 
radial height HL of from 0.20 to 0.30 times the 

tyre section height (H) and a radially outer edge 
(B) located at a radial height HU of from 0.70 to 

0.85 times the tyre section height (H), and the  
 

lining strip (9) extends continuously from the 
inner edge (A) to the outer edge (B), the radially 

outer edge portion and the radially inner edge 
portion of the lining strip are tapered, and the 

main portion therebetween has a substantially 
constant thickness (T) of 0.15 to 0.55 times the 

remaining thickness (t) and in the range of from 1 
to 4mm when measured at the maximum tyre sectional 

width point, the remaining thickness (t) being the 
total thickness of the sidewall portion minus said 

thickness (T) of the main portion.
