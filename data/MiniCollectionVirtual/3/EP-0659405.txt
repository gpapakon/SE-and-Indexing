<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cosmetic composition containing at least one polymer (a) of poly(quaternary ammonium) units and at least one polymer (b) consisting of 70 to 90% by weight approximately of diallyldialkylammonium units in an (a)/(b) weight ratio of strictly less than 1. The invention also relates to the use of such a composition for hair and/or skin care. This composition makes it possible to improve the disentangling of hair (in particular wet hair), as well as the softness of the hair and skin.
