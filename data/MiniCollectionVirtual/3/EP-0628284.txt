<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coupling medium
for a probe of an ultrasonograph.In recent years, various methods have been tried to
treat diseases of the internal organs, without applying
major surgery, so as to lighten the physiological load on
the patient and improve the progress in recuperation.
Also, even if an abdominal operation is to be performed,
the detailed determination of the state of diseased areas
before surgery and determination of the internal state
without having to cut open the organ surface during
surgery would give very meaningful information at the
time of actual surgery. To reply to these needs, in
recent years, ultrasonography has developed and
remarkably spread. The accuracy of the diagnosis using
the ultrasonography before surgery has been extremely
helpful in improving results of surgery in recent years.
In particular, remarkable improvements have been made in
the ability to diagnose diseases of the thyroid glands by
the combination of the ultrasonography method and
diagnosis of cells obtained by centesis and suction.When trying to observe the internal state by placing
the probe of the ultrasonograph directly on the body
surface or organ surface, however, it is difficult to
obtain a clear image in the region within several
centimeters from the surface due to the nature of the
ultrasonograph. Further, the actual body and organ
surfaces are not flat, but have characteristic curves and
unevenness, so it is impossible to bring an inflexible
probe which maintains a certain shape into close contact
with the desired location. That is, when air is present
between the body and probe, the rate of propagation of
the ultrasonic-waves remarkably decreases, and an 
accurate image cannot be formed on the screen of the
diagnostic apparatus.To solve the above-mentioned problems, it is
effective to interpose a suitable spacer (i.e., coupling
medium) between the probe and body. The coupling medium
is preferably made is the form of a sheet-like shape and
is sandwiched between the probe and, for example, the
body surface at the time of diagnosis or is formed into a
suitable shape capable of being used by attaching to the
probe directly or with a fitting. Such a coupling medium
is required to have a suitable flexibility and mechanical
strength and improved acoustic property (i.e., a low rate
of attenuation etc.). For example, Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 55-63636 discloses a
specific water-containing polymer gel. The gel disclosed
therein, however, has problems such as an
