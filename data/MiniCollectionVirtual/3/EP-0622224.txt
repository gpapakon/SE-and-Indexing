<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid ink printer, two printing-medium (30) guide 
systems restrain the medium. One (21) is in an area 

upstream along the direction of medium advance (33) from 
the pen (11,34) and extending laterally across the width 

of the medium (30) except in one or more regions that are 
laterally near the engagement of a print-medium advancing 

device (24, 25). The other guide system (23) is disposed 
laterally from the pen (11, 34), and extends laterally 

across the medium only in one or more regions that are 
laterally near the engagement of the advancing device 

(24, 25). The first guide system (21) restrains the 
medium (30) over an area that stops short of the lateral 

edges (35) and the second guide system (23) is bifurcated 
(23L, 23R) and disposed laterally in two directions from 

the pen (11, 34), and restrains the medium across only 
the lateral edges (35) of the medium. A human-actuable 

control (52) selects a print-medium (30, 30') width, and 
shifts (23L, 23R') at least one bifurcation (23L) of the 

second guide system (23). A tensioning system (26, 27) 
longitudinally beyond the marking head (11, 34) from the 

medium advancing device (24, 25) and generally aligned 
laterally with that device, tensions the medium (30) away 

from the advancing device (24, 25) to hold the medium 
(30) taut at the pen (11, 34). When tensioned, the 

medium moves a normal distance (41) through the apparatus 
at each operation of the advancing device (24, 25); but 

after a trailing edge (32) of the medium (30) passes the 
advancing device (24, 25), the advance distance is 

decreased (42) preferably by about half).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to machines and
procedures for printing text or graphics on printing media
such as paper, transparency stock, and other glossy media;
and more particularly to apparatus and methods that construct
text or images from individual marks created on the
printing medium, in a two-dimensional pixel array, by a
pen or other marking element or head that scans across the
medium.The invention is particularly beneficial in printers
that operate by the thermal-inkjet process -- which discharges
individual ink drops onto the printing medium. As
will be seen, however, certain features of the invention
are applicable to other scanning-head printing processes
as well.U. S. Patent 5,065,169, of Vincent et al., introduces
the importance of controlling pen-to-printing-medium
distance, and flatness of the medium, in an inkjet printer.
Vincent discloses
one way of performing those functions by means of a
spacer formed as a skid, roller or the like that travels
with the pen.That system performs well and is very useful -- particularly
in the context of a printer that has a single
pen. In a multiple-pen printer, however, to facilitate
simultaneous printing the pens advantageously are staggered
along the direction of printing-medium advance; in
such a situation a skid or roller closely associated with
each of one or more trailing (downstream) pens would 
likely smear the ink deposited by one or more leading
pens.Under some circumstances the patented system might
possibly serve even for a dual-pen printer if the skid on
the trailing pen were spaced adequately behind the pen, as
the skid might still be able to control the pen-to-medium
distance adequately at a slightly greater distance from
the pen. Due to accumulated stagger distance, this solution
would be significantly less satisfactory for a four-pen
printer such as is typically employed for color-plus-black
inkjet printing.Even in such cases the patented system might conceivably
serve if the printing medium were limited to paper,
for ink might be absorbed by the paper quickly enough to
permit sliding or rolling of the spacer device over a
printed area without smearing the deposited ink. In
particular such a system might be rendered adequate with
evaporative drying enhanced through aids such as a heater
or fan, or slow throughput (printed area per unit time) to
extend drying time, or combinations of these provisions.Modern color-plus-black printers, however, are called
upon to print transparencies and also to print on other
glossy printing media
