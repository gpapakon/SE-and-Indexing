<ABSTRACT>
A medical probe device comprises a catheter (48) having a stylet guide housing (50) with one or more stylet ports (140) in a side wall thereof and a stylet guide (16) for directing a flexible stylet (17) outward through the stylet port and through intervening tissue at a preselected adjustable angle to a target tissue. The total cather assembly includes a stylet guide lumen (61) communicating with the stylet port and a stylet positioned in said stylet guide lumen for longitudinal movement from the port through intervening tissue to a target tissue. The stylet can be an electrical conductor enclosed within a non-conductive layer (60), the electrical conductor being a radiofrequency electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a device 
for penetrating body tissues for medical purposes 
such as tissue destruction and fluid substance delivery, for 
example. The device penetrates tissue to the precise target 
selected in order to deliver energy to the tissue and/or 
deliver substances. It limits this activity to the precise 
preselected site, thereby minimizing trauma to normal 
surrounding tissue and achieving a greater medical benefit. 
This device is a catheter-like device for positioning a 
treatment assembly in the area or organ selected for medical 
treatment with one or more stylets in the catheter, mounted 
for extension from a stylet port in the side of the catheter 
through surrounding tissue to the tissue targeted for 
medical activity. Treatment of cellular tissues usually requires direct 
contact of target tissue with a medical instrument, usually 
by surgical procedures exposing both the target and 
intervening tissue to substantial trauma. Often, precise 
placement of a treatment probe is difficult because of the 
location of a target tissue in the body or the proximity of 
the target tissue to easily damaged, critical body organs, 
nerves, or other components. Benign prostatic hypertrophy or hyperplasia (BPH), for 
example, is one of the most common medical problems 
experienced by men over 50 years old. Urinary tract 
obstruction due to prostatic hyperplasia has been recognized 
since the earliest days of medicine. Hyperplastic 
enlargement of the prostate gland often leads to compression 
of the urethra, resulting in obstruction of the urinary 
tract and the subsequent development of symptoms including 
frequent urination, decrease in urinary flow, nocturia, 
pain, discomfort, and dribbling. The association of BPH  
 
with aging has been shown to exceed 50% in men over 50 years 
of age and increases in incidence to over 75% in men over 80 
years of age. Symptoms of urinary obstruction occur most 
frequently between the ages of 65 and 70 when approximately 
65% of men in this age group have prostatic enlargement. Currently there is no proven effective nonsurgical 
method of treatment of BPH. In addition, the surgical 
procedures available are not totally satisfactory. Currently 
patients suffering from the obstructive symptoms of 
this disease are provided with few options: continue to cope 
with the symptoms (i.e., conservative management), submit to 
drug therapy at early stages, or submit to surgical 
intervention. More than 430,000 patients per year undergo 
surgery for removal
