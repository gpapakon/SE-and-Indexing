<ABSTRACT>
Connecting device for axial connection of the end portions of at least one optical fibre (14) with another, which are fixed in at least one plug (13) each provided in a coupling house (10), in order to provide an optical connection between the fibres via a lens (12) connectable to each fibre end. Each lens (12) is constituted by a lens body (20), the front end surface (21) of which is partially spherical and the opposite, rear end surface (22) of which is arranged perpendicular against the longitudinal axis of the lens body (24). In the coupling house (11) a ring shaped, partially spherical or conical seat (19) is provided for the front end surface of the lens body, which seat is concentric with the longitudinal axis of the coupling house. The plug (13) is insertable in a coaxial guide sleeve (15) guided in the coupling house (11). The front end of the plug, which is perpendicular to its longitudinal axis, can be pressed to bearing against the rear end surface (22) of the lens body (20) so that the partial spherical end surface of the lens body front, is pressed to bearing against the seat achieving a centering of the lens (12), the plug (13) and the coupling house (11) relatively each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a connecting
device for axial coupling the end portions of optical
fibres, in order to provide an optical connection according to the preamble of claim 1.The rapid development of the field of communication has
resulted that the need for faster and more reliable
transmission media have increased drastically. Optical
fibres have revolutionized transmission possibilities. These
fibres allow a large number of signals to be transferred in
the same fibre and with speeds near that of light. Since the
fibre length is limited at fabrication, these have to be
connected by means of different connecting devices.Connecting devices have to connect optical fibres to each
other, so that the fibre ends can be located exactly axially
right in front of each other. A problem when connecting 
optical fibres ends to each other is their small diameter,
which amounts to some or some tenths of millimetres, while
its optical core can have a diameter of 10-50 Âµm. A
deviation of a thousandth of a millimetre therefore results
in a coarse deviation, whereby the transmission losses
increase drastically. Therefore there are very great demands
on the tolerances of the connecting device, which results in
complicated designs and high manufacturing costs.Through the European patent application no. 494980 corresponding to the swedish patent application no : 8903366-6 and to WO-A- 91/06 023, a connecting device
for optical fibres is known, which requires specially formed
means to centre optical fibres relative to each other.Previously known are connecting devices according to the
British patent GB-2002136, where a spherical lens is used
for transfer of light signals, as well as US-4421383, US-46-91985,
US-4711518 and US-4770488 for centring and connection
of an optical fibre with a lens device. The lens devices in
each connecting device are used to transmit the light
between two fibre ends. In these documents there are no
directions of how the centring of the glass fibre relatively
the lens and the coupling house should be achieved.Moveover EP-A-0 006 662 discloses a connector 20 having two portions,
which in one each portion is provided with a housing 21a,
which in a bore 37a receives a guide sleeve 23a having a
coaxial bore for receiving a plug 43a, which holds a fibre
35a end portion close to, but not in contact with a ball-lens
25a. Further, one end of the guide sleeve 23a is
provided with a seat 41a having inclined surfaces, bearing
on the ball-lens. Also, one end of said housing bore 37a is
arranged

<CLAIMS>
A connecting device for axially coupling the end portions of optical fibres (14),
to provide an optical connection between said fibres comprising:


a coupling housing (11) having a longitudinal axis (24) and a channel (18) coaxial with said coupling housing;
a cylindrical plug (13) inserted in said coupling housing (11), to
receive end portions of said optical fibres (14);
a lens (12) connected to the end of each optical fibre of said plug, and inserted in said channel of the coupling housing; wherein
the coupling housing (11)
further comprises at one end of the channel (18) a ring shaped, partially spherical or conical seat (19)

for receiving the front end surface of said lens, which seat being concentric with the
longitudinal axis of the coupling housing, and said plug (13) being inserted in a coaxial

guide sleeve (15) guided in the coupling housing (11);
characterized in,
that
 the lens (12) consists of a substantially cylindrical lens
body (20), the front end surface (21) of which is partially spherical and the opposite, rear end

surface (22) of which is flat and arranged perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the lens body,
(24),
in that
 said lens body (20) has a diameter substantially smaller than the diameter of said channel (18), so
that a space (26) between the lens body (20) a
nd the inner wall of said channel (26) is provided, and in

that
 the plug (13) has a front end surface which is perpendicular to its longitudinal axis, and is
pressed to bear against the flat rear end surface (22) of the lens body (20) by means of a spring

(25) so that the partially spherical front end surface of the lens body, is pressed to bear against
the seat, and due to the play of the lens body in said space (26) and the pressure of the plug a self centring of the axes of the lens (12), the

plug (13) and the coupling housing (11) relative other is achieved.

 the outer surface of the guide sleeve (15) is either conical, with a
diameter decreasing in direction towards the lens (12) in said channel, or cylindrical, and

 the plug (13) is designed for reception and fixation of
several optical fibres (14) in exact relative mutual positions.

 the front end of the coupling housing (11) is designed with
axial and radial guide dowels (34) provided for interaction with

corresponding guide dowels at a second connecting device axially
