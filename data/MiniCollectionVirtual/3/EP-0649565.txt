<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a fitting unit for a multilayer hybrid circuit (5) with power components (10) which facilitates very good heat dissipation from its semiconductor power components (10). To this end, the multilayer hybrid circuit (5) is fitted on a heat conductive baseboard (1; 1a), where the baseboard (1) is a ceramic plate covered with copper foil (3) or a ceramic-coated copper foil.
