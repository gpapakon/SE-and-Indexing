<ABSTRACT>
A metal fitting for a composite electrical 
insulator (1) including a plastic rod (2), e.g., an FRP 

rod. The metal fitting (4) includes a radially inwardly 
deformable sleeve portion having a bore (5) into which 

an end portion of the rod (1) can be inserted for 
fixedly securing the metal fitting (4) to the rod (1). 

The bore (5) in the metal fitting (4) has an inner 
surface which is formed with fine protrusions (7). 

These protrusions (7) provides a satisfactory 
resistivity to the tensile force applied to the 

insulator (1), to thereby effectively prevent withdrawal 
of the rod (2) from the metal fitting (4) when it is in 

use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
metal fitting for composite electrical insulators, and
more particularly to a metal fitting which is to be
fixedly secured to one end portion of a plastics material rod of
the insulator for firmly and stably clamping the rod.
The invention also relates to the insulator having the metal fitting.A composite electrical insulator is known,
e.g., from U.S. Patent No. 4,654,478, wherein one end
portion of a fiber-reinforced plastics rod with
an adhesive material applied to it is inserted into the bore in a
sleeve portion of the metal fitting and the metal
fitting is then fixedly secured to the plastics rod.
Such a metal fitting serves to clamp the rod and thereby
connect the insulator to an electric cable or the like.
The metal fitting is usually subjected to caulking,
i.e., compressed radially inwardly onto the plastic rod
so as to firmly clamp the rod. That is to say, by
compressing the metal fitting radially inwardly with a
suitable die, that region of the rod situated
opposite to the metal fitting is uniformly clamped to 
integrally connect the metal fitting with the
rod for preventing withdrawal of the rod from
the fitting even under a large tensile force.The composite electrical insulator as known
from U.S. Patent No. 4,654,478 has proved to be highly
advantageous in that it is light in weight and has a
sufficient mechanical strength. However, there may be
instances in a normal use condition of the insulator,
wherein the rod comes to be withdrawn from the
metal fitting. Such withdrawal may be caused by a
gradually decreased clamping force originating from the
initial caulking, and/or upon application of an excessive
tensile force to the insulator. In this connection, an
increase in the initial clamping force is limited, e.g.,
in view of the compressive strength characteristic of
the plastics material. Therefore, it is highly desirable
to effectively prevent the withdrawal of the rod
from the metal fitting for a prolonged period, without
increasing the initial clamping force.DE-A-1921299 shows a similar composite insulator, in
which the bore of the metal fitting, into which the end
portion of the core rod is inserted has a wave-profiled surface.It is therefore an object of the present
invention to provide an improved metal fitting for
composite electrical insulators, which is adapted to
provide a higher resistance to the tensile force
applied to the insulator thereby effectively preventing
withdrawal of the rod from the metal fitting 
when it is in
