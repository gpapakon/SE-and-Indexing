<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger has a core assembled of integrally formed modules (11). Each module encloses channels (17) separated by strengthening webs (16) and its large, flat, external faces carry respective arrays of fins (18, 19). By stacking the modules, with facing arrays of fins interleaving, further channels (20) are formed. The enlarged surface area of channels (20) compared with channels (15) (preferably these surface areas are in a ratio of over 7:1) makes the stack of modules suitable for heat exchange between parallel counterflows of fluids of differing heat capacities. Preferred apparatus has air fan-forced, via straight manifolds, through channels (20) - the interleaved fins serving to even out air temperatures and speeds across the channels' widths - whilst the ends of channels (17) are closed and a liquid (or liquids) enters and leaves channels (17) at right angles thereto although once in the channels (17) the liquid flows in parallel counterflow to the air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved heat exchanger
cores and in particular heat exchanger cores which
incorporates a plurality of heat exchanger elements or
modules which may be utilised in applications where heat
energy is to be transferred from one fluid to another.There are many types of heat exchangers known. These
can be generally divided into two main groups, the first
being shell-and-tube heat exchangers and the second being
plate heat exchangers. One example of a shell and tube
heat exchanger comprises an array or bundle of tubes and a
surrounding for external shell. Plate heat exchangers may
have plate-fin arrangements such as described in U.S.A.
Patent 4,282,927 or a series of rectangular stacked plates
creating flow channels from two or more fluids when the
plates are sealingly stacked upon one another as described
for example in U.S. Patent 4,823,867.In each of the two groups, in order to manufacture the
heat exchanger, a number of parts are usually fabricated
and joined together. In shell and tube heat exchangers,
for example, a number of tubes are assembled into a bundle,
and prior to having the ends of each tube sealed into
corresponding apertures of a pair of tube sheets, baffles
are installed along the length of the bundle. The bundle
of tubes, baffles and tube sheets are then placed inside a
pressure vessel which seals a pair of end zones around the
tube sheets so that there are two fluid flow paths defined,
the first being around the outside of the tubes and between
the tube sheets, and the second being inside the tubes and
in end chambers of the pressure vessel. In both the shell
and tube configuration and the plate type heat exchanger,
there is a large amount of material dedicated to defining
and sealing fluid flow paths, and since the flow paths are
defined by joining fabricated parts, there is always the 
danger of one fluid leaking into another.In addition, fabricated heat exchangers suffer from
inefficiency brought about by a plurality of boundaries
constituted by welds, joins or parts interconnecting
adjacent components of the heat exchangers, the boundaries
providing zones of resistance to the conduction of heat to
heat transmission surfaces of the exchanger. An integral
part of heat exchangers formed by processes such as
extrusion or casting are known as "primary structure" and
must be differentiated from components welded or otherwise
attached to the primary structure wherein such components
including the boundaries are termed "secondary" structure.
