<ABSTRACT>
An undercarriage assembly (20) for a work vehicle (10) includes first and second roller frame assemblies (22, 24), one on each side of the vehicle (10), an idler wheel assembly (28, 30) connected to one end of each roller frame assembly (22, 24), and a drive wheel (32, 34) connected to the opposite end of each roller frame assembly (22, 24). An endless elastomeric track belt (39) encircles a respective drive wheel (32, 34), roller frame assembly (22, 24), and idler wheel assembly (28, 30) on each side of the vehicle (10). A rigid support beam (26) connects each roller frame assembly (22, 24) to the main frame (12) of the vehicle (10). Each idler wheel assembly (28, 30) includes first and second self-aligning mechanisms (72, 90) to provide that the track belt (39) runs true and straight. The roller frame assemblies (22, 24) can be spaced laterally from the vehicle (10), using various size spacers, to provide various gage settings of the endless track belt (39). During adjustment of the roller frame assemblies (22, 24), a supporting arrangement (142) supports one track roller assembly (22) by the other track roller assembly (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an 
undercarriage assembly for a work vehicle and more 
particularly to an undercarriage assembly which 
includes first and second roller frame portions, a 
plurality of guide rollers, first and second idler 
wheels, an endless elastomeric belt, and first and 
second self-contained hydraulic tensioning assemblies 
connected between respective first and second idler 
wheels and first and second roller frame portions. Construction, earthmoving, and agricultural 
type work vehicles are often equipped with endless 
self-laying track chain assemblies for support and 
propulsion of the vehicle. Such prior art track type 
vehicles, utilizing metal track chain assemblies, are 
generally low speed, noisy vehicles and work in 
environments which do not require any adjustment to 
the track gauge. More recently, work vehicles having 
endless elastomeric track belts have been utilized to 
perform work tasks previously accomplished by metal 
track equipped vehicles. The vehicles having 
elastomeric track belts have many advantages over 
metal track vehicles and also over wheel type work 
vehicles. Some of these advantages include less 
weight and maintenance, lower soil compaction, lower 
noise levels, and the ability to travel on improved 
roadways. One type of prior belted vehicle is disclosed in 
U.S.-A-4,817,746. 
In this patent, each of the  
 
endless elastomeric belts is driven by a pair of 
elevated drive wheels and is guided and supported by a 
pair of large diameter idler wheels and a plurality of 
smaller diameter guide rollers. The idler wheels and 
guide rollers are supported and suspended by a 
plurality of links, levers, and fluid cylinders. This 
large number of components in the undercarriage and 
suspension adds complexity, weight, and cost to the 
vehicle. Another type of belted vehicle having a track 
roller frame assembly is disclosed in U.S. -A-4,836,318. 
This patent discloses a vehicle having a track 
roller frame which is connected to the front of the 
vehicle by a pivot joint, and is connected to the rear 
of the vehicle by a collar which extends between the 
two drive wheels. The track roller frame also has an 
inside support device which connects the roller frame 
to the vehicle on the inside of the drive wheels. 
Although this type of suspension and track roller 
frame would appear to function satisfactorily for this 
particular type of vehicle, it is rather complex and 
limits the ground clearance under the vehicle. The 
roller frame supports between
