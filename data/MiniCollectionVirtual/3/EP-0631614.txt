<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to carboxylic acid based cleansing
bars.Firm, low smear, skin pH or weakly acidic cleansing bars
as defined herein, are believed to be novel. US-A-3,557,006,
Ferrara et al., issued Jan. 19, 1971, discloses a
composite soap bar having an acid pH in use. Also see GB-A-513,696,
Mangeot, accepted Oct. 19, 1939. JA-A-No.
54-151410, filed Nov. 21, 1979, and published
June 6, 1985, discloses a weakly acidic cleansing cream, but
useful solids are not disclosed. A "weakly acidic" bar has a pH
of from about 4.8 to about 6 which is distinguished from a neutral
pH bar.Commercial neutral pH bars, e.g., DOVE® (RTM), CARESS® (RTM), and OLAY® (RTM),
usually contain only a maximum of about 5% moisture. Prior art
neutral pH bars containing substantial levels of hygroscopic
materials, soft solids, or liquids, including water, are soft or
sticky with poor smears; such prior art neutral pH bars are soft
or have relatively poor smears.Cleansing bars, per se, with reduced bar smear are reported
in the art. E.g., US-A-2,988,511, Mills, issued June 13,
1961, discloses a low smearing
bar.Bar smear, also referred to as bar sloth, is the soft solid
or mush that forms at the surface of a bar when submerged in water
and is regarded by consumers as messy, unattractive, and uneconomical.High moisture and low smear personal cleansing bars are
disclosed in US-A-4,606,839 Harding, issued Aug. 19, 
1986. Harding uses coconut and/or palm kernel oil soap.However, an examination of a used personal cleansing bars in
today's average bathroom will show that there is still a need to
improve cleansing bar smear.Bar smear is especially poor in neutral pH bar formulations
which contain higher levels (50% ±10%) of synthetic surfactant.The formation of rigid, soap curd fibers of sodium laurate is
reported by L. Marton et al. in a 1940 Journal of American Chemical
Society (Vol. 63, pp. 1990-1993). The report does not teach a
utility for the soap curd. Shaped solids, as defined herein, are
not disclosed by Marton et al. Additionally, the formation of
this curd of fibers does not disclose free mono- and/or dicarboxylic
acids.JP-A-7030-798, July 30, 1980, discloses transparent
solid framed or molded soap bar in which fatty acids
constituting the soap component are myristic, palmitic, and
stearic acids. A transparent soap is described in which at least
90 wt.% of the fatty acids which constitute the soap component are
myristic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. The product is
reported as a transparent, solid soap having good
