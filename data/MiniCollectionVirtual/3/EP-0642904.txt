<ABSTRACT>
The process comprises the successive operations which consist in:     A - setting up a cold pattern 1, constituting a true copy of the final component to be obtained, made of a material which is easy to machine and has good dimensional stability at room temperature; B - producing a cold mould 2, recovering the impression (mould cavity) of the cold pattern 1, made of a very rigid laminated material; C - obtaining a hot pattern 4 by moulding, in the cold mould 2, a material 3 of high dimensional stability up to 250 DEG C; D - obtaining a polymerisation hot mould (5) made of carbon/bismaleimide-resin laminated material, from the hot pattern 4.     The mould obtained according to the invention makes it possible to produce components made of bismaleimide resin and also components made of epoxy resin, considerably increasing, in this latter case, the lifetime of the mould.
