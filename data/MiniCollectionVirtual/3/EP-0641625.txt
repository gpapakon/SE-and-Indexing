<ABSTRACT>
Optical fibers (15) are supported within a bonded support member (16) 
having along opposite sides first and second grooves (14) which are 

parallel to the 
central axes of the fibers being supported. A first opening is formed 

in a holder 
member (21) which includes a first projection (27). A cantilever spring 

member (23) 
is formed in the holder member having a second projection (27) opposite 

the first 
projection. The bonded fiber support member (16) is inserted into the 

opening such 
that the first projection engages the first groove (14) on one side, 

and the second 
projection engages the second groove (14) on the other side of the 

bonded support 
member. Thereafter, the bonded support member is locked into position 

and the 
holder biases one end of it against a polishing wheel to permit 

polishing along a 
plane which is perpendicular to the axes of the optical fibers. By making 

the grooves 
in the support member by photolithographic masking and etching, and by 

making the 
projections in the holder by electron discharge machining, one can assure 

great 
alignment accuracy. The cantilever spring is preferably made by electron 

discharge 
machining to be part of a monolithic holder member and is made to exert a 

sufficient 
bias to hold the support member temporarily in place. Thereafter, the support 

member is locked in place by biasing a coil spring (28) against it. This use of 
spring 

bias means for holding the support member in the holder permits sufficient 

force to 
be exerted on the support members to permit polishing, but without risking 

cracking them.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical fiber connectors and, more particularly,
to techniques for polishing the ends of optical fibers of an array.The U. S. patent Bonanni, No. 4,818,058, granted April 4, 1989,
describes an optical fiber connector that can be
used for splicing or interconnecting two optical fiber arrays. The connector
comprises two opposed chips in which matching V-grooves have been made for
supporting individual fibers of an array. The chips are of a monocrystalline material
such as silicon in which the V-grooves are made by photolithographic masking and
etching with an extremely high degree of precision. After corresponding parallel V-grooves
have been made in two chips, the array of optical fibers is sandwiched
between them, with each fiber being supported in matching V-grooves of the two
chips. The chips are bonded together, and the protruding fiber ends are polished, for
example, by abutting them against a polishing wheel. Thereafter, the free ends of
two such connectors can be abutted to splice or interconnect the optical fibers of two
fiber ribbons, each ribbon defining a fiber array.Efforts to automate the polishing step have proven difficult because of
the need for holding the supported optical fiber exactly perpendicularly with respect
to the polishing wheel. The silicon chip support members are rather fragile, so care
must be taken not to exert too much force on them. There has therefore developed a
need for a method for expediently polishing the ends of optical fiber connectors such
that all of the fibers are polished to a common plane which is precisely perpendicular
to their central axes. Such methods should require a minimum of operator skill, be
consistent with modern robotic apparatus, and not damage the connector devices.The invention is defined in claim 1. Dependent claims 2 to 12
relate to embodiments of the invention. The invention will be
better understood from a consideration of the following detailed description taken in
conjunction with the accompanying drawing.FIG. 1 is a top view of part of a support member for supporting optical

A method for polishing ends of an array of optical fibers (15) to make
them suitable for interconnection with another array comprising the steps of:


forming a plurality of corresponding parallel V-grooves (12) in first and second
support members (11, 13);
supporting portions of each optical fiber (15) of the array within
opposed V-grooves of the first and second support members,

such that the array of optical fibers is sandwiched between the
support members,

and bonding the first
and second support members together to form a bonded support member (16);
said bonded support member defining first and second grooves (14) on
opposite outer surfaces thereof extending in the same direction as said parallel V-grooves;
holding said bonded support member such that optical fibers supported
therein are perpendicular to a surface of a polishing wheel (30);
and rotating the polishing wheel and contacting ends of the optical fiber
to the polishing wheel to polish them to a common plane; characterized by the steps
