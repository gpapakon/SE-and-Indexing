<ABSTRACT>
A method of determining a hapten which comprises: (1) contacting the sample which contains or may contain the hapten with a first binding partner which binds the hapten; (2) separating the hapten bound to the first binding partner from material which is not bound by the first binding partner; (3) contacting the hapten bound to the first binding partner with a second binding partner which binds the hapten; and (4) assaying the hapten bound to a binding partner as is described. Kits are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DETERMINATION OF HAPTENSThe present invention relates to the determination of haptens. More specifically this invention relates to a method of determination of haptens which has the benefit of high specificity to reagents used in such a method and to their preparation and to kits useful in such a method.Many methods of determining haptens exist but a frequent problem encountered with present commercially employed method relates to lack of specificity. This is often because the binding partners employed bind not only the hapten being determined but also other haptens of related chemical structure. If one had infinite time and resource it should be possible to generate a binding partner that bound only the chosen hapten and none orher. In practice this desirable s r i.Î¹ no:: achieved and an unwelcome degree of cross reactivity can occur. The determination would be improved if the disadvantageous effects of this cross reactivity were reduced or eliminated. One method of ""cleaning up" samples has been to treat the sample with an antibody which removes at least some cross reacting substances before determining the hapten. However, this can require assays to be carried out on treated and 

untreated samples to provide full data and is generally inconvenient. Clearly it would be an advantage, for example, if in a determination for one hapten such as a steroid hormone the effect of other related haptens such as other steroid hormones could be reduced or eliminated, or for example, if in the determination of a drug of abuse the effect of chemically related innocuous materials could be reduced and only one assay needed to be carried out.A method has now been found which enables the determination of haptens to be carried out with a good degree of specificity and without the need for more than one assay to be performed.The present invention provides a method of determining a hapten which comprises:1. Contacting the sample which contains or may contain the hapten with first binding partner which binds the hapten.2. Separating the hapten bound to the first binding partner from material which is not bound by the first binding partner.3. Contacting the hapten bound to the first binding partner with a second binding partner which binds the hapten. 

4. Assaying the hapten bound to a binding partner.It will be understood that the first and second binding partners are non-identical. This means that they will have different cross reactivities so that the effect of interfering (ie cross reacting) substances will be

 1230 CLAIMS
1. A method of determining a hapten which comprises:
1235 (1) Contacting the sample which contains or may contain the hapten with a first binding partner which binds the hapten; (2) separating the hapten bound to the first binding partner from material which is not bound by the first binding
1240 partner; (3) contacting the hapten bound to the first binding partner with a second binding partner which binds the hapten; and (4) assaying the hapten bound to a binding partner.
1245 2. A method is claimed in claim 1 wherein the first binding partner is a monoclonal antibody against a first epitope of the hapten and the second binding partner is a monoclonal antibody against a different epitope of the hapten.
1250
3. A method as claimed in claims 1 or 2 wherein the hapten is a steroid.
4. A method as claimed in claim 3 where in the 1255 hapten is cortisol. 


 5. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 wherein an agent which aids release of the hapten from the first binding partner is also
1260 employed.
6. A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein the agent is an analogue of the hapten.
1265 7. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6 wherein an equilibrium is employed between hapten bound to the first binding partner, free hapten in solution and hapten bound to the second binding partner.
1270
8. A kit which comprises a first binding partner for a hapten and a second binding partner for a hapten.
1275 9. A kit as claimed in claim 8 wherein the first binding partner is immobilized on a solid surface and the second binding partner is immobilized on a solid surface.
