<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a valve arrangement having a flow-control valve which exhibits a valve piston which is guided in a sealing manner and such that it can be displaced axially in a valve bore counter to the force of the spring, and having a control line which connects a pressure side of the flow-control valve to a pressure-limiting side of the flow-control valve, the control line being arranged such that it can be easily produced without a high degree of outlay. For this purpose, it is provided that the control line (48, 50) is guided through the valve piston (22).

A valve arrangement (10) for a pump, having a flow control valve with a valve piston
(22) which is axially displaceable and sealingly guided in a valve bore against the force

of a spring (24), having an opening (37) to the pressure side, having a control line
connecting the pressure side, located closest to the consumer, of the flow control valve to

a pressure relieving side of the flow control valve, and having a pressure relief valve (54)
arranged in the pressure relieving side, the valve piston (22) opening a connection to the

suction side of the pump when the pump pressure is high, characterised in that the control
line passes through the valve piston (22), and in that the valve piston (22) has an

extension piece (46) which is preferably cylindrical and which reaches into the pressure
side, an axial bore (48) forming the control line being arranged within this extension

piece (46) and being connected to at least one channel opening into the pressure relieving
side of the valve piston (22).
A valve arrangement in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that the axial bore (48) ends at the pressure side of the valve piston (22)

via a region (50) of relatively small diameter.
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the channel is formed by an interior space (58) of the valve piston (22) and a

connection (69).
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the interior space (58) is connected to the pressure relief valve (54).
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the axial bore (48) opens directly into an interior space (14) receiving the valve

piston (22).
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the region (50) of relatively small diameter is arranged at the pressure side or

alternatively at the pressure relieving side of the flow control valve.
