<ABSTRACT>
A height-adjusting device for a furniture element (piece of furniture), for example a table, having a height-adjusting plate (36) resting on the floor and rotatably held, is distinguished by the fact that a first adjusting element (2) is fixedly arranged on the furniture element and has steps (11) on its underside, steps of a second adjusting element (14) are pressed against these steps (11), the second adjusting element being adjustable with respect to the first adjusting element (2), and the height adjusting plate (36) is arranged on the underside of the second adjusting element (14). In this arrangement, it is possible to adjust the height adjusting plate relative to the second adjusting element or simply to perform an adjustment of first and second adjusting element relative to one another, so that both adjusting possibilities are independent of one another.
