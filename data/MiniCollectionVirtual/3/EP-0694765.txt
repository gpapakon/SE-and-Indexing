<ABSTRACT>
The detector is of displacement type and includes a housing (100) in which an electrical transducer (400) is located and a device (300) for connecting the transducer to external devices. The detector includes a wedge (600) with spring (610) which locks the transducer against a wall of the housing. The locking wedge (600,610) is fixed during assembly of the detector. The electrical transducer (400), which is a Hall effect or magneto-resistive type, is carried on a rigid printed circuit (500) which is held in place by the wedge.
