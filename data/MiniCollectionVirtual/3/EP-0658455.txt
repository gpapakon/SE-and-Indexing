<ABSTRACT>
A structure for attachment of a weather strip (W4) around 
an opening of a vehicle body, which is opened and closed by 

a closing member (14). A base portion (30) of the weather strip is 
bonded with two double-sided adhesive tapes (32A, 32B) to the vehicle 

body in the longitudinal direction thereof. The outer 
double-sided adhesive tape (32A) has a thickness greater than 

that of the inner double-sided adhesive tape (32B), and the 
material of the outer double-sided adhesive tape is softer 

than that of the inner double-sided adhesive tape.

Hei 6-234303, filed in Japan on September 2, 1994, and
Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 6-252846, filed in
Japan on September 21, 1994 are hereby incorporated into
the present specification by this referece.The present invention relates to weather strips for
motor vehicles, and more particularly to a structure for
attachment of weather strips around openings of vehicle
bodies, which can be closed or opened by closing members
such as doors. Along door openings formed in a side body of a motor
vehicle, for example, as shown in FIG. 1, weather strips W
are installed along a roof side rail 10 and a center pillar
12 to provide seals around door window panes 14. These
weather strips W are attached to vehicle bodies with
retainers (Japanese Utility Model application laid-open
JP-U-68218/89).More specifically, as shown in FIG. 2 which is a
cross-sectional view taken along the line A-A of FIG. 1, a
retainer 16 is secured to a bottom wall of the roof side
rail 10, which defines a door opening of a vehicle body,
and a tubuler weather strip W1 is fitted in the retainer
16. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 3 which is a
cross-sectional view taken along the line B-B OF FIG. 1,
retainers 17 and 18 are respectively installed along front
and rear surfaces of an outer panel of the center pillar
12. A weather strip W2 is composed of weather strips W2A
and W2B on which front and rear door window panes 14
respectively abut upon closing of a vehicle door. These
weather strips W2A and W2B are respectively fitted in the
retainers 17 and 18. In FIGS. 2 and 3, reference numeral
20 denotes a roof side moulding, 21, 22 and 23 denote
opening trims. The retainers are secured to vehicle bodies
with screws or the like, and seal members are interposed
between the retainers and the vehicle bodies to provide a 
good seal therebetween.Recently, the adhesive properties of double-sided
adhesive tapes have been improved. Also, demands to reduce
the manufacturing cost of vehicles have recently
intensified. Under
