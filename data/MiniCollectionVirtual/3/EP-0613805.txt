<ABSTRACT>
A flexible hose (5) with two special connectors (6,7) at each end. 
One end couples to a special ground connection (6) which is attached to 

the sewer pipe the other end is attached to a special connection (9) on 
a recreational vehicle for the purpose of directly transmitting effluent 

or waste liquid from the vehicle to the sewer or septic tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a direct sewage system for 
recreational vehicles. With the increasing use of recreational vehicles for leisure 
persuits, the need arises for a facility capable of directly 
disposing of the effluent from these vehicles into a sewer - 
whether they are caravans, motorhomes or long distance coaches. It therefore falls upon environmentally conscious park owners, 
motorway services area managers and bus station managers to 
provide proper facilities for for these vehicles to empty their 
effluent tanks directly into the sewer. At present no such 
facilities exist. According to the present invention there is provided a direct 
sewage system which comprises a set of special connectors and a 
length of flexible hose. The connectors are coupled to the 
caravan, motorhome or coach and to the special sewer connector 
flange in the ground to allow effluent to pass directly from 
the vehicle into the sewer. A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described by 
way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in 
which:- 
Figure 1 shows in section the sewer connector flange with a 
removable plug. Figure 2 shows in section the sewer connector flange with the 
flexible hose and connector inserted. Figure 3 shows in section the flexible hose and the connections 
to the vehicle. Referring to the drawings when the system is not in use a plug, 
4 is inserted in the sewer connector flange, 1 as shown in 
fig.1, the plug is removed for access to the sewer. Fig 2 shows the sewer connection coupling 6, inserted in the 
connector flange 1, the '0' ring 3 seals the coupling and gives 
a push fit. Fig 3 shows the vehicle connection couplings, the coupling 7 is 
attached to the flexible hose 5 and is pushed on the coupling 8 
to complete the link-up between the vehicle and the sewer.

<CLAIMS>
A direct sewage system for recreational vehicles 
comprising a cast iron sewage connector flange which is coupled 

to the main sewer. A length of flexible hose with a push-fit 
connector at each end connects the effluent outlet of the 

vehicle directly into the sewer. 
A direct sewage system as claimed in Claim 1 where waste 
liquids other than effluent are discharged to the sewer from 

the vehicle. 
A direct sewage system as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 
where waste is discharged into a septic tank or other than a 

main sewer.
