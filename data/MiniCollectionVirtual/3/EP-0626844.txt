<ABSTRACT>
Compositions suitable for the treatment of acne by topical application comprise clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide. Kits for preparing the compositions include a solution of clindamycin in a first container and a gel suspension of benzoyl peroxide in a second container. Each component is stored at a pH which promotes stability, and the combination of the two components provides a final composition having a pH which promotes stability and enhances viscosity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
compositions and methods for formulating compositions for
treatment of acne. More particularly, the present invention
relates to compositions comprising benzoyl peroxide and
clindamycin for treatment of acne by topical administration.Acne is a common skin disorder characterized by
blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules, cysts, and various
sized nodules and scars which, in the inflammatory state of the
disorder, are contaminated with bacteria such as
Propionibacterium acnes. The disorder effects skin areas where
the sebaceous glands are most active, and bacterial infection
can occur in the sebaceous follicles.A variety of acne treatment methods have been
developed, including both systemic and topical administration
of antibiotics, topical administration of organic peroxides,
particularly benzoyl peroxide, and the like. Of particular
interest to the present invention is the topical administration
of antibiotic compositions and other active ingredients, such
as benzoyl peroxide.A particularly effective topical composition for the
treatment of acne is a combination of erythromycin, a topical
antibiotic, and benzoyl peroxide, as described in U.S. Patent
No. 4,497,794. Compositions prepared generally as described in
the '794 patent are sold under the tradename Benzamycin® by
Dermik Laboratories, Inc., Collegeville, Pennsylvania.
Benzamycin® is widely prescribed for the treatment of acne and
is recognized in some cases to be more effective than treatment
with either erythromycin or benzoyl peroxide alone.The use of products which combine erythromycin and
benzoyl peroxide, however, suffers from certain disadvantages.
The combination of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide is
unstable and requires refrigeration for storage. The need to
refrigerate the product is not only inconvenient for the
patient (e.g., it is difficult to continuously refrigerate the 
product when travelling), the application of a cold medicine to
the face is often unpleasant and reduces patient compliance.
The need to store the product in a refrigerator can further
reduce patient compliance since the product is "hidden away."The Benzamycin® product suffers from particular
formulation problems. In order to prepare the product, a
pharmacist must dissolve erythromycin powder in alcohol from
the pharmacy stock. Variations in particular alcohols which
are available can lead to variability in the compounded
product. Moreover, improper compounding by the pharamacist is
possible because of the variable
