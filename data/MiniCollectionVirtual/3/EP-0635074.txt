<ABSTRACT>
A metal component like a spinner for producing mineral wool material consists of or at least comprises a unitary cast piece of metal superalloy preferably on the basis of nickel or cobalt, which unitary cast piece is in the form of a single crystal. The component may be produced in a receptacle (11) consisting of a lower crystal forming chamber (12) and an upper workpiece forming chamber (15) connected by a single crystal selecting constriction (16), or starter, so as, in combination with suitable heating means (20) and drawing speed, to allow drawing of a single crystal to form all of the unitary cast workpiece in the cavity (19) of the mould or receptacle (11). The single crystal is significantly more corrosion resistant than the same material of poly-crystal structure. The capability of sustaining higher strain at high temperature before creep rupture after 1000 h on the one hand, and the high ductility leading to a more even stress distribution within the material and avoiding stress peaks on the other hand cooperate to make a spinner of the invention best suited for operation at high temperatures as they are preferred in the fiberization of rock wool like basalt by internal centrifugation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a metal spinner component for producing wool or other fibre 
products made of mineral material, to a specific component 
in form of a spinner for the production of mineral wool 
material for insulating purposes by centrifugation of molten 
mineral material through a multitude of orifices of small 
diameter in a circumferential wall of said spinner, and to a 
method of producing such a component, specifically such a 
spinner. Metal components of this kind are subject to corrosive attack 
by the mineral melt like molten glass, basalt or the 
like. The corrosion occurs in components like bushings or 
the like without substantial mechanical strain, which are 
subject to temperatures of 1300°C and more, and in components 
like spinners under mechanical strain. In either case, 
elements or compounds of the melt react with constituents of 
the metal component with the consequence of a depletion 
thereof of certain constituents which eventually leads to 
failure or strength decrease, or need of replacement, of the 
component. In case ofa component made from metal forming a 
passivation layer against corrosion or oxidation, the 
mineral melt will tend to dissolve such passivation layer 
with the consequence that the layer is constantly rebuilt 
through diffusion of the dissolved constituents from the 
component, a process which eventually also leads to a 
decrease of the concentration of the dissolved constituent  
 
in the metal component. Thus, where a chromium oxide film is 
formed as passivation layer like in case of a carbide-hardened 
metal superalloy on the basis of nickel or cobalt, 
the attack of the molten mineral material will deplete 
chromium, and where an aluminium oxide film is formed as 
passivation layer as in a gamma-prime superalloy, aluminium 
will be depleted with the consequence that eventually there 
will not be sufficient aluminium left in the alloy to form 
the intermetallic Ni3Al phase. This situation is further aggravated if the component is 
also subject to substantial mechanical strain, as in case of 
a so-called spinner. Such spinners for the so-called internal centrifugation of 
molten mineral material so as to be attenuated into mineral 
fibers to form mineral wool for thermal and/or acoustical 
insulation purposes are subject to a variety of critical 
strains: They have to operate at high temperatures often 
well in excess of 1000°C, and under high mechanical strain 
due to the mechanical centrifugal forces created by the high 
velocity of rotation.
