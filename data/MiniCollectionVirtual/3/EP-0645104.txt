<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved jewel setting method comprising the 
steps of: making a hole (3) in an object (1) which is capable of 

returning to its original shape and size after being deformed; 
forming overhangs (8) around the top circumference of the hole (3); and 

press-fitting a jewel into the hole (3) by causing the overhangs (8) to 
be yieldingly withdrawn, allowing the girdle of the jewel to 

pass through the space (7) delimited by the surrounding overhangs (8), 
and then, allowing the overhangs (8) to return to their original 

positions, thereby catching the bezel of the jewel. Thus, 
neither hammering nor pressing is required in mounting jewels in 

objects. Examples of such materials are plastic, ivory, horn, 
wood and metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of setting jewels in
certain objects for ornamental purposes, particularly setting
jewels in objects of plastics or the like in firm and sure manners.Jewel setting methods are shown for instance in Japanese Utility
Models 62-9,914(A) and 63-191,916(A).In the former publication a through hole is made in a metal
object; the inner wall of the through hole is enlarged circumferentially
at a level just below the top circumference of the
through hole, thus forming a circumferential seat; a jewel is
inserted in the through hole until its girdle is put on the circumferential
seat; and the top circumference of the through hole
is hammered to extend and overhang the jewel, thus holding the
jewel by its bezel.In the latter publication a through hole is made in a metal
object; the through hole is enlarged around its top
circumference; a jewel is put in the through hole; and the enlarged
circumference of the through hole is pressed against the
bezel of the jewel, thus holding the jewel by its bezel.These jewel setting methods require the hammering or pressing of
the metal object around the opening in which the jewel is inserted,
and therefore, these methods cannot be applied to objects
of materials other than metals. Also, minute, precise
works are required in setting jewels in metal objects, and accordingly
the working efficiency is lowered, and the jewel-setting
cost is high.In setting jewels in plastics objects adhesives are used to fix
jewels in the holes made in such non-metal objects. Such adhesives,
however, are liable to lower its adhesion with age. It
may happen that jewels fall off from the holes of an object when 
subjected to impacts, as for instance the object falls on the
floor.Therefore, there has been an increasing demand for effectively
setting jewels in objects of plastics and other materials at an
increased efficiency. GB-A-841 565 relates to articles of jewellery. A body is
made from a resilient material and is formed with a recess
in the surface of the body and an integral lip at the edge
of the recess. A stone is mounted in the recess and held
therein, at least in part, by the lip which overlies the
edge of the stone. The body and its integral lip is made
from a moldable plastics. The recess may be of a
corresponding shape to the rear face of the stone so that
the stone fits snugly into the recess. The stone may
additionally be held in the recess by an adhesive. In
forcing an ornamental piece into the rim, the rim is
expanded against its inherent

<CLAIMS>
A method of setting at least one jewel (4) in an object (1)
which is of a material capable of returning to its original

shape after being deformed, comprising
the steps of:


a) making in the object (1), a hole (3) which corresponds
to the jewel
 in shape, but is somewhat smaller than the jewel
(10);
b) making a circumferential slot (7) on the inner wall (5a)
of the hole just below the top circumference (1a) of the hole

opening forming an engagement edge (8) between the slot and the
surface of the object, the slot (7) being larger in diameter

than the jewel and having a predetermined width;
and
c) press-fitting the jewel (4) in the hole (3) by causing
the hole at the engagement edge to be yieldingly enlarged and

then, allowing the hole of the engagement edge to return to its
original shape and size, thus causing the jewel to be caught in

the circumferential slot on the inner wall of the hole.
A method according to claim 1, further comprising the step of:

chamfering the top side circumference of the engagement
edge (8) to provide a circumference (12) descending toward the

hole.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said material is
plastic, ivory, horn, wood and metal.
A method of setting at least one jewel (4) in an object
(20) which is of a material capable of returning to its original

shape after being deformed, comprising
the steps of:


a) forming a plurality of projections (21) on the circumference
of a hole (3) which is to be made in the object;
b) making in the object, a hole (3) which corresponds to
the jewel in shape, but is somewhat smaller than the jewel;
c) cutting a circumferential slot (7) extending between the inner wall
(5a) and the lower portion of the innerside of the projections (21),

thereby forming overhang (22) in the respective
projection (21), the slot (7) being larger in diameter than the

jewel; and
d) press-fitting the jewel in the hole by causing the
projections to be yieldingly withdrawn and then, allowing them

to return to their original position, thus causing the jewel to
be caught by the circumferential projections around the hole.
A method of setting at least one jewel (4) in an object
(30) which is of a material capable of returning to its original

shape after being deformed, comprising
the steps of:


a) forming an annular projection (31) on the circumference
of a hole (3) which is to be made in the object;
b) making in the object, a hole (3) which corresponds to
the jewel in shape, but is somewhat smaller than the jewel;
c) cutting a circumferential slot (7) extending between the inner wall (5a)
and the lower portion of the innerside of the annular projection (31),

thereby forming overhang (32) in the projection
(31), the slot (7) being larger in diameter than the jewel

and having a predetermined width; and
d) press-fitting the jewel in the hole by causing the annular
projection to be yieldingly expanded and then, allowing it 

to return to its original shape and size, thus causing the jewel
to be caught by the annular projection around the hole.
A method according to claim 4, wherein said projections
(21) are arranged so as to hold jewels (4) side by side.
