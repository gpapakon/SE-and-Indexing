<ABSTRACT>
The method, in which a ram (9) is dropped over a height in a tubular 
pile (8), provided with a foot, onto an impact face (11) situated in 

said tubular pile, in order to transfer the kinetic energy from the ram 
to the ground (13) near the tubular pile, for driving the tubular pile 

into the ground, is characterised in that the kinetic energy of the ram 
is transferred dispersed to the ground near the tubular pile. Devices 

for this are characterised in that means which can temporarily absorb a 
part of the kinetic energy of the ram are provided. These means can be 

spring elements (12), and can lie between ram and impact face or between 
impact face and the wall of the tubular pile. In particular, at least 

one spring element can be fastened to the ram at the bottom. In this 
case at least one spring element can have a linear, progressive, 

depressive or a combined action, and/or a pre-tension and/or a limit for 
limiting the lenght change can be provided in it. Such a spring element 

can also be made of rubber or plastic and/or can have a dampind effect. 
The tubular pile can be made in particular of steel or plastic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and device 
for driving tubular piles, in which a ram is dropped over a 
height in a tubular pile, provided with a foot, onto an 
impact face situated in said tubular pile in the bottom part thereof, in order to 
transfer the kinetic energy from the ram to the ground near 
the tubular pile, for driving the tubular pile into the 
ground. Such a method is often used if the working space is 
not high enough to drive concrete piles, as is the case 
inside existing buildings, or where the access opening is 
small. Since the ram falls in a tubular steel pile, and 
since the tubular pile can be welded together in sections 
during pile driving, little working height is needed. A widened foot of steel or concrete is sometimes 
placed around the tubular pile. Instead of that, a widened 
foot is sometimes also driven out after the tubular pile 
has been driven into the ground. When the tubular pile is at the correct depth, it can 
be cut off at the correct height and filled with concrete, 
in which reinforcement can be provided. Driving a tubular steel pile is normally carried out 
by placing a plug of, for example, sand, gravel or concrete 
or a second steel plate in the bottom part thereof and 
dropping a solid metal ram, with a diameter generally lying 
between 80 and 500 mm and a weight generally lying between 
100 and 4,000 kg, in the tube onto the ground, plug or 
plate, so that a force impulse is produced thereon (GB-A-1 474 379). The direct contact between ram and tubular pile, 
causing a very great peak force, is regarded as essential 
in this method, in order to make the use of a relatively 
small falling weight possible. This known method has the disadvantage that a part of 
the energy of the ram is not utilised for driving the 
tubular pile into the ground, but goes into the tubular 
pile itself and can lead there to undesirable plastic 
deformation if the wall thickness is small.  
 When the ram falls at great speed the force impulse 
in fact within a very short time causes the build-up of a 
great tensile stress wave in the tubular pile. The object of the method according to the invention 
is to eliminate or reduce these disadvantages, through the 
fact that the kinetic energy of the ram is transferred more slowly 
to the ground near the tubular pile. The devices 
according to the invention are essentially characterised in 
that for this purpose means which temporarily absorb at 
least a part of the kinetic energy of the ram are provided.
