<ABSTRACT>
A bone plug (1) for intramedullary insertion into the 
canal (12) of a bone (11) to restrict the bypass of cement (13) during 

implant (14) surgery is described. The bone plug (1) is made of a 
bioabsorbable material and has a tapered central body (2) 

providing the primary support for the plug (1). A plurality 
of radially extending disc-like fins (3) extend from the body (2) 

at spaced locations. The taper provides the distal fin 
with a greater degree of flexibility due to the long 

cantilever, thus permitting an ease of insertion into the 
intramedullary canal (12) while the larger diameter body (2) and 

shorter proximal fins lend structural stiffness to resist 
the migration of the device (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to orthopaedic products
and in particular plugs for long bone canals which
restrict the flow of cement during prosthesis
implantation.During implant surgery and in particular the
implantation of a hip prosthesis, it has long been known
to cement the prosthesis to the bone. In order to cement
the prosthesis to the bone, the bone canal is broached or
reamed to the desired shape to match the shape of the
prosthesis anchoring portion. An anchoring portion of the
prosthesis is then inserted, for example into the broached
femoral bone to replace the natural ball portion of the
hip bone.In order to fix the anchoring portion to the long
bone, it has been known to use cements such as
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) which is inserted into the
bone canal and packed upon the prosthesis prior to
insertion of the prosthesis. These cements such as PMMA
then anchor the anchoring portion of the prosthesis to the
bone material. In order to provide for a secure joint between the
prosthesis and bone at the cement interface, it is desired
to have the cement completely surround the prosthesis in
the interstices between the prosthesis and the bone
material. However, the insertion forces required to
insert the implant often drive the cement substance down
into the intramedullary canal and away from the fixation
site. In this way, voids are formed in the cement mantle
which later become stress points leading to early failure
of the devices.In order to address this concern, intramedullary
devices such as plugs have been developed by manufacturers
of implants in order to restrict the flow of the bone
cement further into the intramedullary canal than is
desired. Thus, when the implant is forced into the
broached portion of the intramedullary canal the tendency
of the thick bone cement to flow down the canal is
prevented by the presence of blockage in the form of an
intramedullary bone plug.For example U.S. Patent 4,245,359 shows a plug made
of a plastic material which acts as a cement barrier for
openings produced by operative procedures. The plug is
clamped between the side walls of the opening by means of
elastic flanges which prevent bone cement from escaping 
downward upon insertion of a stem portion. U.S. Patent
4,293,962 shows a device for plugging the medullary canal
in joint replacement surgery technique. The plug prevents
the cement used for fixation from extending beyond the
point where it is useful. The device is comprised of a
tapered cylindrical plug which is threadedly engaged to a
flexible
