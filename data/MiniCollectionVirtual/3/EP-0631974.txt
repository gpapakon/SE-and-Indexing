<ABSTRACT>
A wheel cover 15 is provided with a radial bearing 18 
adapted to support a driving shaft 7 at its axial one end 

portion. The driving shaft 7 has its actuating mechanism 
side shaft portion for supporting an actuating mechanism 20 

so extended as to be supported by the radial bearing 18, so 
that a shaft deflection can be decreased at the time of 

actuating operation of the actuating mechanism 20 to avoid a 
shaft deformation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manual chain block,
and more specifically to a manual chain block having a load
sheave supported rotatably between a pair of side plates to
be driven interlockingly by a manual actuating mechanism
having a hand wheel.Conventionally, for example as disclosed in the Japanese
Utility Model Publication No. Sho. 62 (1987)-16477 and as
shown in Fig. 22, a manual chain block has a load sheave 103
supported rotatably between a pair of side frames 101, 102.
A driving shaft 104 is inserted into a shaft bore of the
load sheave 103, and a hand wheel 105 constructing an
actuating mechanism is threadably engaged with axial one end
of the driving shaft 104. The inside of the hand wheel 105
is connected to a driven hub 106 with a reverse prevention
gear 107 and a pair of lining plates 108, 109 interposed
between a flange portion of the driven hub 106 and the hand
wheel 105 as well as a reverse prevention pawl 110 is
pivotally mounted to the side frame 101 so as to engage with
the reverse prevention gear 107, whereby a transmission
mechanism 111 provided with a mechanical brake is
constructed. A reduction gear mechanism is mounted to
the axial other end of the driving shaft 104. In addition to the above-mentioned construction, a wheel
cover 113 for covering the transmission mechanism 111 and
the hand wheel 105 is attached to the side frame 101, and a
gear cover 114 for covering the reduction gear mechanism
112 is attached to the side frame 102. These covers 113,
114 are joined integrally to the side frames 101, 102
respectively by a stay bolt 115. A hook 116 is attached to
upper portions of the side frames 101, 102 through an
attachment shaft 117, and a chain kicker 118 is attached to
lower portions thereof.The driving shaft 104 arranged as mentioned above is
supported rotatably at its axial one end portion extending
outward beyond the side frame 102 by a radial bearing 119
mounted to the gear cover 113 with its axial other end
portion extending outward beyond the side frame 101 being in
the free state and threadably engaged with the hand wheel
105 and its intermediate portion being supported rotatably
by a radial bearing 121 within a shaft bore of the load
sheave 103. The transmission mechanism 111 and the hand
wheel 105 are assembled onto the free end portion of the
driving shaft 104 outside its supported portion.Incidentally, the symbol 122 in Fig. 22 designates a
stopper for restraining an axial movement of the hand wheel
in the relaxing direction. Accordingly, the hand wheel 105
is

second side plates (1, 2), a load sheave (3) having a shaft

bore (3a) and supported rotatably between said side plates
(1, 2), an actuating mechanism (20) provided with a hand

wheel (8), a driving shaft (7) passing through the shaft
bore (3a) of said load sheave (3) and interlocking at its

axial one end portion to said actuating mechanism (20) to
be actuated by said actuating mechanism (20), and a

reduction gear mechanism (11) disposed at the axial other
end portion of said driving shaft (7), wherein a wheel

cover (15) for covering said actuating mechanism (20) is
attached to said first side plate (1) and a gear cover (16)

for covering said reduction gear mechanism (11) is attached
to said second side plate (2), characterised in that


on the side of the wheel cover (15) there is provided
a radial bearing (18) for supporting the axial one end

portion of said driving shaft (7); and
said driving shaft (7) has the actuating mechanism
side shaft portion for supporting said actuating mechanism

(20) extended so that the extended shaft end portion can be
supported by said radial bearing (18).
A manual chain block as set forth to claim 1, wherein
radial bearings (18, 19) for supporting said driving shaft

(7) are disposed on the side of said wheel cover (15) and
on the side of said gear cover (16) respectively;


said driving shaft (7) is supported rotatably at its

axial opposite end portions by said wheel cover (15) and
said gear cover (16) through the respective bearings (18,

19) separately from said load sheave (3); and
said load sheave (3) is supported rotatably by said
first and said second side plates (1, 2) with a

predetermined gap kept between the inner peripheral surface
of the shaft bore (3a) thereof and the outer peripheral

surface of said driving shaft (7).
A manual chain block as set forth in claim 2, wherein
said actuating mechanism (20) is provided with a mechanical
