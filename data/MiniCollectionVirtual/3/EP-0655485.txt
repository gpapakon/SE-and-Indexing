<ABSTRACT>
Linear, unsubstituted quinacridone pigments of the  beta -phase can be produced in an environmentally friendly manner by   a) cyclising 2,5-dianilinoterephthalic acid in polyphosphoric acid or a polyphosphoric ester to give quinacridone, b) then hydrolysing the quinacridone with water at a temperature of at least 40 DEG C, preferably at from 60 to 100 DEG C, to obtain the crude, finely divided quinacridone pigment which is predominantly in the  alpha -phase, c) then optionally wet-grinding the crude, finely divided quinacridone pigment from b) (pre-pigment), and d) then heating the crude pigment from b) or the pre-pigment from c) to a temperature beween 120 and 200 DEG C in the presence of from 0.1 to 1.5 times the amount of an inorganic base, based on the weight of the crude pigment, in an inert liquid medium (solvent finish).   To improve the depth and hue of the colour, an oxidative treatment with a peroxodisulphate can be carried out subsequently.

A process for preparing linear, unsubstituted
quinacridone pigments or pigment preparations of

the β-phase, which comprises

a) cyclizing 2,5-dianilinoterephthalic acid in
poly-phosphoric acid or a polyphosphoric ester

to the quinacridone,
b) then hydrolyzing the quinacridone with water at
a temperature of at least 40°C to obtain a

finely divided quinacridone pigment crude which
is predominantly in the α-phase,
c) then optionally wet grinding the finely divided
quinacridone pigment crude from b) to form a

pre-pigment, and
d) then heating the crude pigment from b) or the
pre-pigment from c) to a temperature between 120

and 200°C in the presence of from 0.05 to 0.3
times the amount of an inorganic base, based on

the weight of the crude pigment, in an inert
liquid medium.
The process of claim 1, wherein the wet grinding is
carried out in the presence of an inorganic base in

an aqueous or aqueous-organic medium.
The process of claim 1, wherein step d) is carried 
out in the presence of from 0.05 to 0.113 times the

amount of an inorganic base, based on the weight of
the crude pigment.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the inorganic base is used in the form of a

from 0.1 to 2.0% strength by weight, preferably
from 0.5 to 1.5% strength by weight, aqueous

solution.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the inorganic base is sodium hydroxide,

potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium
carbonate, ammonia or a mixture thereof.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein step d) is carried out in the presence of

from 0.5 to 10 times, preferably from 1 to 5 times,
the weight of an alkali-resistant solvent based on

the weight of the crude pigment.
The process of claim 6, wherein the alkali-resistant
solvent is a C

-alkanol, preferably a
butanol or isopropanol.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein step d) is carried out at a temperature

between 125 and 175°C.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 8,
further comprising the addition, before, during or

after step d), of a pigment dispersant of the
formula (I)
