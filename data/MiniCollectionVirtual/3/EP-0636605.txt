<ABSTRACT>
An organic solvent solution of glyoxime and a chlorinating 
agent are charged into a reaction vessel to produce an 

organic solvent solution of dichloroglyoxime in a stable 
form, simply and in a high yield. Dichloroglyoxime is used 

as an industrial antibacterial agent, an antiseptic, a slime 
control agent, an agricultural chemical and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing 
dichloroglyoxime, which is used as an industrial 
antibacterial agent, an antiseptic, a slime control agent, 
an agrochemical, and the like, in a safe form, 
simply, and in a high yield. Heretofore, dichlologlyoxime has been used in 
industrial antibacterial agents, antiseptics, slime control 
agents, agricultural chemicals, and the like, normally in 
the form of a solution. Dichloroglyoxime (III) has been known and produced for 
a long time, generally starting from glyoxal (I) to produce 
glyoxime (II), which is then chlorinated. Production methods of glyoxime include, for example, 
the following. 
(1) Reaction of aqueous glyoxal solution with hydroxylamine 
(W. V. Meyer, Chem. Ber., 16, 505 (1883); Ulpiani, Gazz. 
Chem. Ital., 42 I, 250 (1924); GB 1,307,223; US 4,539,405) (2) Reaction of dlbromoacetaldehyde with hydroxylamine 
(Wittorf, Zh. Russ. Fiz.-Khim. O-va, 32, 97 (1900)) (3) Reaction of dichloroacetaldoxime with hydroxylamine  
 
(Routala, Neovius, Chem. Ber., 57, 253 (1924)). Of these methods, the method (1) starting from aqueous 
glyoxal solution is the most preferable in view of raw 
material availability and economy. Hydroxylamine to be reacted with glyoxal can be 
obtained by neutralizing a commercial inorganic acid salt of 
hydroxylamine, such as hydroxylamine sulfate or 
hydroxylamine hydrochloride, with an alkali. In glyoxime synthesis, this neutralization is carried 
out in the presence of glyoxal, and precipitated glyoxime is 
filtered (GB 1,307,223; US 4,539,405). Another method uses free hydroxylamine. In this 
method, to an acid aqueous solution of glyoxal, a commercial 
50% aqueous solution of hydroxylamine or an organic solvent 
solution of hydroxylamine, such as methanol, ethanol, 
propanol , or butanol solution, is added. The above reactions are summarized as follows: 
1. Oximization (1) 
 
Oximization (2) 
2. Chlorination 
Some examples of dichloroglyoxime production methods 
are as follows: 
(1) Reaction of α-glyoximecarboxylic acid with chlorine 
(Ponzio, de Paolini, Gazz. Chim. Ital., 56, 252 (1926)) (2) Reaction of furoxanecarboxylic acid with chlorine 
(Ponzio, de Paolini, Gazz. Chin. Ital., 56, 252 (1926)) (3) Reaction of glyoxime with chlorine in dilute 
hydrochloric acid (Ponzio, Gazz. Chim. Ital., 60, 434 
(1930); Hauben, Kauffmann, Chem. Ber., 46, 2826 (1913); 
Steinkopf, Juergens, J. Prakt. Chem., 〈2〉83, 467 (1911); B. 
G. White, GB 1,307,223) (4) Reaction of glyoxime with chlorine in ethanol at -20°C
