<ABSTRACT>
Vacuum generating means for providing reduced pressure 
for sewage transport in a vacuum sewer system, which means 

comprises a liquid-driven ejector (3), the working medium of 
which is fed to the ejector (3) by a circulation pump (6) from 

a sewage collecting container (5), the suction side (4) of the 
ejector 3 being, via a check valve (9), connected to a vacuum 

sewer network (2) . Sewage delivered through the sewer network 
flows through the ejector (3) into the collecting container 

(5). The bore of the discharge pipe (11) of the ejector, is 
substantially cylindrical throughout. Its length (L) is 8 to 

20, preferably 10 to 15, times the diameter (D) of its bore 
and the pipe (11) discharges directly into the open interior 

of the collecting container (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to vacuum generating means for a
vacuum sewer system and in particular to the use of an ejector
as a pump in such a sewer system.Ejectors have long been used as a source of partial
vacuum in vacuum sewer systems. Such an arrangement is shown
in US-A-4034421. According to this known art, the working
medium of the ejector is a flow of liquid fed by a circulation
pump to the ejector from a sewage collecting container. The
suction side of the ejector is connected to a vacuum sewer via
a check valve so that air and sewage delivered to the sewer
are drawn through the ejector to the collecting container.
The total efficiency rate of such a vacuum generating means
is only about 5%. This is because the efficiency rate of the
circulation pump is about 40% and only about 10% to 15% of its
useful power can be utilised in the ejector powered by it.
An improvement of the efficiency rate of the vacuum generating
means is, however, not usually of any great importance per se.Improving the total efficiency rate of a liquid-driven
ejector working as an air pump has been subject to extensive
research. Nevertheless, the aim of the present invention is
not to improve the efficiency rate of the ejector. This
invention is based on the idea that in the special application
of an ejector as the vacuum generating means for a vacuum
sewer system it is more important to maximise the air flow
drawn into the ejector at a sufficiently high vacuum level
(higher vacuum = smaller absolute pressure). In a vacuum
generating means according to the invention, the ejector
discharges directly into a container (e.g. at atmospheric
pressure). Under these circumstances the pressure and the
kinetic energy of the mass flow from the ejector is not
utilised at all and this has a decisive influence on the
optimising of the function of the ejector.One aim of the invention is to optimise the function of 
a vacuum generating means using an ejector according to the
preamble of claim 1 in an operational environment typical for
vacuum sewer systems. It is important that a sufficiently
high vacuum is generated by the ejector and that at the same
time the air flow volume through the ejector is maximised.
A typical vacuum level in a vacuum sewer system is about one
half of atmospheric pressure, but considerable variations from
this vacuum level occur in different applications.What constitutes the invention is set out in the
following claim 1. The diffuser traditionally used in an
ejector (that provides a conically enlarging end portion of
