<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is an apparatus for 
preparation of a coating hopper. A preparation pan is 

positioned beneath the hopper lip during hopper 
preparation wherein flow within the hopper is chaotic 

and the curtain is not stable. The preparation pan 
includes edge walls spaced apart from the edge guides 

to stabilize the unsteady curtain within the 
preparation pan. The invention minimizes splashing and 

splattering of the coating liquids thereby minimizing 
contamination of the coating equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to preparation
pans for use in preparing coating hoppers. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an
improved curtain coating preparation pan for use in the
manufacture of photographic materials such as
photographic film and paper.In curtain coating, a traveling web or object
is coated by a free-falling curtain of coating liquid
that is caused to impinge onto the traveling web or
object to form a layer thereon. The width of the
free-falling curtain is maintained by edge guides that
are in wetting contact with the lateral boundaries or
edges of the curtain. For example, in aqueous solution
systems for photographic products it is known to use a
curtain coating method which comprises the simultaneous
application of silver halide emulsions containing
gelatin as a binder, by using a slide hopper coating
apparatus to form a multilayer photographic film or
paper. A moving web is coated by a free-falling
curtain of coating composition wherein the multilayer
composition is formed on the slide hopper and caused to
fall as a curtain and impinge the moving web to form
the coated layer thereon. The formation of a composite
of a plurality of distinct layers on a moving web is
described in U.S. Patent No. 3,508,947, which relates
particularly to the manufacture of multilayer
photographic materials such as photographic film and
paper. In the process of curtain coating, the
coating hopper is usually filled and flushed with water
or cleaning solution for some time prior to being
filled with coating solutions. This procedure will
henceforth be referred to as hopper preparation. As
the hopper is flushed with water and the water is
purged from the hopper by the coating solutions, the
flow through the hopper may not be steady. In other
words, during hopper preparation it is common to
encounter flow rate pulsations on the hopper slide and
in the curtain. During this time it is difficult to
maintain a full width curtain without breaking due to
the unsteady flow and fluid inhomogenities. This
generally causes the curtain to degenerate and break
into an unsteady, uncontrolled flow. As these
solutions leave the hopper lip they have a long
distance to fall before they contact a solid surface.
The solutions accelerate as they fall. The result of
the impingement of the high velocity unsteady fluids on
a solid surface is splashing in the coating area. This
splashing or splattering can contaminate equipment with
water and/or coating solutions.Contamination of equipment such as the
boundary air

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for preparing a coating
hopper (10) having one or more metering slots between one or

more hopper elements, the hopper elements forming a
slide surface terminating at a lip wherein coating

liquids issuing through the metering slots form one or
more layers flowing down the slide surface which form a

free-falling curtain at the lip having transversely
spaced edges and edge guides (17) spaced a distance apart

for stabilizing each edge of the curtain, the apparatus
comprising:


a preparation pan (22) positionable beneath the
hopper lip said preparation pan having a surface for

intercepting the free-falling curtain;
edge walls (23) extending from said preparation
pan, said edge walls spaced apart from the edge guides

when said preparation pan is positioned beneath the
hopper lip, said edge walls having an outer surface

facing each edge guide; and
flushing means for issuing a lubricating
solution along the outer surface of the edge walls

wherein the free-falling curtain not intercepted by
said preparation pan is stabilized at each edge by said

edge walls such that splattering is minimized.
The apparatus according to claim 1
wherein the edge walls are spaced apart from the edge

guides by 0.5 to 5.0 centimeters.

wherein the outer surfaces of each edge wall have a

contact angle of 60 degrees or less with the
lubricating liquid.
The apparatus according to claim 1
wherein the outer surface of each of said edge walls

comprises shallow closely spaced grooves. 
The apparatus according to claim 1
wherein the outer surface of each of said edge walls

has been roughened to improve wettability.
The apparatus according to claim 1
wherein the outer surface of each of said edge walls

has been chemically treated to improve wettability.
The apparatus according to claim 1
wherein the edge walls comprise stainless steel.
The apparatus according to claim 1
wherein the edge walls comprise titanium.
