<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of conditioning flue gases containing solid particles, in particular the flue gases from waste-incineration plants, prior to purification of the gases, preferably using dry additives, the method calling for water to be sprayed into the gas stream. The water is sprayed into the gas stream upstream of the gas-purification plant by means of a spray-drying installation, preferably one with a rotary sprayer.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the conditioning of flue gases from incinerating 
plants polluted with solids for subsequent flue gas 

purification with dry additives by spraying water into the 
gas stream, characterized in that said water is sprayed 

into the gas stream through a spray drying installation 
having a rotating atomizer. 
The use of spray drying installations having a rotating 
atomizer for the conditioning of flue gases from incinerating 

plants polluted with solids for subsequent flue gas 
purification with dry additives by spraying water into the 

gas stream.
