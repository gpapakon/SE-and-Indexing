<CLAIMS>
Foodstuff composition wherein 5 to 75% by 
weight of fat content based on a standard foodstuff 

composition are substituted by 1 to 15% by weight of a 
fructan or a fructan mixture, without the quantity of free 

water in the composition being increased based on the 
standard composition, the content in fructan or fructan 

mixture based on the water contained in said composition is 
1 to 25% and such that the organoleptic properties and time 

microbiological stability in said foodstuff composition are 
identical to those of a standard composition. 
Foodstuff composition according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the fructan or one component of the 

fructan mixture is a linear fructan, a branched fructan 
and/or a partially hydrolyzed fructan. 
Composition according to claim 2,
