<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel Group V and VI metal 
complexes and in particular to their use as olefin polymerisation 
catalysts. In particular the invention relates to novel chromium 
imido complexes. Catalysts comprising transition metals have been widely used 
for polymerisation reactions. For example bis(cyclopentadienyl) 
metal complexes containing zirconium or titanium have long been 
recognised as an important class of catalyst systems for the Ziegler-Natta 
polymerisation of olefins, when used with suitable cocatalysts. To improve the commercial performance of olefin polymerisation 
catalysts it would be desirable to improve their resistance to 
poisons while using low cocatalyst to catalyst ratios. It would also 
be desirable to improve the tolerance of olefin polymerisation 
catalysts to functionalised comonomers. Transition metal-nitrogen multiple bonded species are known to 
act as both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for a variety of 
reactions. WO 94/01471 relates to transition metal olefin polymerisation 
catalysts and discloses generally the preparation and use of cationic 
metal complexes having reactive metal-ligand sigma bonds stabilised 
by polyanionic ligands. Particularly suitable complexes disclosed 
are tungsten and niobium complexes in which the polyanionic ligands 
are represented by aryl imido groups. We have now found that specific transition metal imido 
complexes may be used as olefin polymerisation catalysts which show  
 
stability and reduced catalyst deactivation. We have also found that certain novel chromium imido complexes 
may be prepared and may be particularly suitable for use as olefin 
polymerisation catalysts. Thus according to the present invention there is provided a 
catalyst or catalyst precursor suitable for use in the polymerisation 
of olefins comprising a metal imido complex having the formula I or 
II 
wherein in Formula I M is Group V metal and in Formula II M is Group 
VI metal.
 
R = alkyl or aryl and may be the same or different,
 
Z = bridging group chosen from (CH₂)x wherein x = 3-6, arylalkylene, 
or heteroalkylene groups,
 
X = organic group containing a cyclopentadienyl nucleus,
 
Y = univalent anionic ligand, halide, amido, hydrogen, alkyl or aryl 
and may be the same or different, and
 
with the proviso that when M is niobium or tungsten R is not aryl. Preferred complexes are those wherein M is vanadium or 
chromium. R is for example tert-butyl or aryl eg p-tolyl and Y is halide. Particularly preferred complexes are those
