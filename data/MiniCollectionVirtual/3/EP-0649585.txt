<ABSTRACT>
A switching arrangement that can be connected in a communications channel that comprises a pair of lines, between sets of terminal equipment, which comprises: (i) a d.c. voltage window detector circuit (3) that is connected between the lines and is responsive to the voltage between the lines; and (ii) one or more switching circuits (2, 4) connected in or between the lines that can be actuated by the window detector circuit (3) when, and only when, the voltage between the lines is within a predetermined band; so that the or each switching circuit (2, 4) can be remotely actuated by means of a d.c. signal on the line, the arrangement including a low pass filter associated with the or earch switching circuit having a cut off frequency that is sufficiently low to prevent the switching circuit(s) being actuated by a ringing signal on the channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communications circuits, and especially
to maintenance termination units for use in telephone circuits.In recent years, and especially in view of deregulation of many
telephone systems, privately owned communication equipment has
increasingly been installed in the premises of subscribers to the
system, with the result that it is often necessary to determine whether
any fault is located in the telephone line, or in the subscriber's
premises, i.e. in the subscriber's equipment or cabling, in order to
determine whose responsibility it is to repair the fault. It is highly
advantageous economically if this determination can be performed
remotely by sending an appropriate signal from the local exchange
along the line, thereby obviating the necessity to send any telephone
company personnel to the subscriber's premises.In order to test the telephone line for any faults it is necessary
firstly to install a so-called "maintenance termination unit" or MTU in
the line at the subscriber's premises which can disconnect the
subscriber equipment from the line (often called sectionalizing the line) 
and connect the a and b or tip and ring lines on receipt of the
appropriate signals from the exchange. During the line testing
procedure determinations will typically be made of the line to line
resistance and of the first and second line to ground resistance. Also
the line continuity can be determined by detecting the presence of the
MTU electronically.Various forms of MTU are described in the prior art, and may
employ solid state (silicon) switches or electrical relays. The present
invention is concerned with solid state switching devices in view of
their greater reliability and lower cost as compared with arrangements
that incorporate relays. A number of such devices are described, for
example, in US Patent No 4,710,949 to Om Ahuja. This device
comprises a pair of voltage sensitive switches, one located in each of
the tip and ring lines, and a distinctive termination connecting the tip
and ring lines on the subscriber side of the voltage-sensitive switches.
The voltage-sensitive switches may each have a threshold voltage of
about 16 volts so that they are closed in normal operation by the 48
volt battery voltage but will open when this is replaced by a test
voltage below about 32 volts in order to test the line-to-ground and tip-to-ring
impedances. The distinctive termination may, for example,
comprise a back-to-back diode and Zener diode which will exhibit an
asymmetric resistance when large

<CLAIMS>
A switching arrangement connected in a communications
channel that comprises a pair of lines between sets of terminal

equipment, which switching arrangement comprises

(i) a control circuit (13) that is connected between the lines and
is responsive to the voltage between the lines, and
(ii) at least one switching circuit (2,2',4) connected in or between
the lines be actuated by the control circuit.

characterised in that

(a) the control circuit is a d.c. voltage window detector circuit (3)
which actuates the switching circuit (2,2',4) only when the

voltage between the lines is within a pre-determined band, the
lower limit of the band being greater than the maximum signal

voltage, and
(b) a low pass filter (C3,R5) (C7,C8,R14,R15,R16) is associated
with the switching circuit, said filter having a cut off frequency

that is sufficiently low to prevent the switching circuit being
actuated by a ringing signal on the channel.
An arrangement according to Claim 1 wherein the upper limit of the
pre-determined voltage band is below the peak value of the ringing

voltage.
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, the window detector
circuit includes a Zener diode (24) that sets the lower limit of the

voltage band within which current will flow. 
An arrangement as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, which includes
a series switching circuit (2,2') connected in each of the lines.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 4, wherein the series switching
elements (2.2') will open when subjected to an overcurrent on the lines.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 5, wherein the series witching
circuit (2,2') in each of the lines comprises a switching transistor

(T1,T2,T3) whose base or gate voltage is controlled by an overcurrent
control element (T4), the overcurrent control element switching on

when the switching circuit is subjected to an overcurrent, thereby
switching the switching transistor off.
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 6, wherein each series switching
circuit includes a test control element (T5) that also controls the base

or gate voltage of the switching element, the test control transistor
turning on when current flows in the window circuit (3), thereby turning

the switching transistor (T1,T2,T3) off.
An arrangement as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 7, wherein each
series switching circuit (2,2') is capable of remaining open for a period

of time after termination of the actuating d.c. signal.
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 8, wherein each series switching
circuit includes a capacitor (C2) connected to an input terminal of the

test control transistor, the capacitor being charged during actuation of
the switching circuits by the d.c. signal and holding the switching circuit

open for a period of time after termination of the actuating d.c. signal. 
An arrangement as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 9, which includes
a shunt switching circuit (4) connected between the lines or between

each line and earth.
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 10, wherein the shunt switching
