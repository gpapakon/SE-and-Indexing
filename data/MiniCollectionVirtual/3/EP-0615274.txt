<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ionising-particle imaging device. It comprises a gas-filled chamber of asymmetrical structure, formed in succession by a particle entry window (2) charged to a negative potential V2, a multiwire anode electrode (3) charged to a positive potential V3 with respect to a reference potential, and a cathode electrode (4) placed in the vicinity of the anode electrode (3). The cathode electrode, charged to the reference potential, is formed by an array of parallel electrically conducting bands (4k). The detection of the position of impact of the ionising particle, according to the pitch of the array, is carried out by induction of a delayed electrical pulse caused by an avalanche of the ionisation electrons resulting from the ionising particle in the vicinity of the band situated in line with the impact of the particle in the chamber, the reference time being that of the ionisation electrons produced close to the wires. Application to one-dimensional electrophoresis.
