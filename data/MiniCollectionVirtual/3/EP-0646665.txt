<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for treating a 
ply-twisted crimped multifilament yarn. The process 

involves adjusting the temperature and moisture content of 
the yarn prior to passing the yarn through a stuffer box 

which is essentially free of steam. Excess hot fluid is 
removed from the yarn, and the yarn's temperature is 

adjusted to a temperature in the range of about 40° to 
90°C before the yarn is passed through the stuffer box. 

The yarns may be used for making a textured saxony-type 
carpets having a tightly tailored surface texture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
application Serial No. 07/733,353 filed on July 17, 1991 
now abandoned. The present invention relates to an improved 
process for treating a ply-twisted crimped multifilament 
yarn. More particularly, the process involves adjusting 
the temperature and moisture content of the yarn prior to 
passing the yarn through a stuffing chamber. These yarns 
are especially suitable for producing textured saxony-type 
carpets having a tightly tailored surface texture. A large portion of carpets used in residences are 
known as cut pile carpets which include saxony-type 
carpets. In saxony-type carpets, heat-set, ply-twisted 
pile yarn is inserted into a backing material as loops 
which are then cut to form vertical tufts. The tufts are 
then evenly sheared to a desired height which is typically 
about 0.4 to 0.7 inches. Generally, there are two 
different styles of saxony-type carpets: 1) a straight-set 
style in which the filaments at the tuft tip are straight 
and substantially perpendicular to the plane of the carpet 
face, and 2) a textured style in which the tufts and the 
individual filaments have varying degrees of curl. Yarn which is used as pile in textured saxony-type 
carpets is prepared by cabling together two or more 
singles yarns, heat-setting them in their twisted 
condition, and finally drying them. One known method of 
processing the ply-twisted yarn involves feeding the yarn  
 
Superba® which treats the yarn with pressurized saturated 
steam to heat-set the twist. The yarn is axially 
compressed within the stuffing chamber. Another known 
method involves feeding the ply-twisted yarn through the 
stuffing chamber and then passing it through a continuous 
heat-setting machine known as a Suessen which treats the 
yarn with dry heat to heat-set the twist. The yarn is 
tufted into a carpet backing material, and the carpet is 
subjected to standard dyeing and finishing operations 
including stain and soil resist treatment. Depending upon the twist level of the yarns and 
other factors, textured saxony-type carpets may exhibit 
different surface textures. For example, a frieze carpet 
is made from pile yarns having a "high ply-twist". By the 
term "high ply-twist" as used herein, it is meant a ply-twist 
level of greater than about 5.5 turns per inch 
(tpi). When such yarn is processed and then tufted into a 
backing material, the resulting carpet tufts are highly 
kinked and curled. This gross buckling of the tuft 
structure gives the carpet a distinct

<CLAIMS>
A process for treating a ply-twisted crimped 
multifilament yarn, comprising the steps of: 


a) impinging the ply-twisted yarn with a heated 
fluid such that the yarn is saturated with water and 

heated; 
b) removing excess heated fluid from the saturated 
yarn prior to passing the saturated yarn through a 

stuffing chamber, said yarn having a temperature in the 
range of 40° to 90°C immediately prior to being passed 

through said stuffing chamber; and 
c) passing the yarn through said stuffing chamber, 
wherein the yarn is axially compressed to impact helical 

compression deformations into the filaments said stuffing 
chamber being essentially free of steam. 
The process of claim 1, further comprising the 
step of passing the yarn through a heat-setting chamber, 

wherein the twist is heat-set, subsequent to passing the 
yarn through the stuffing chamber. 
The process of claim 2, wherein the twist is 
heat-set by treating the yarn with pressurized saturated 

steam. 
The process of claim 2, wherein the twist is 
heat-set by treating the yarn with dry heat. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the yarn is 
impinged with saturated steam such that the yarn is 

saturated with water and heated. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the yarn is a 
nylon yarn. 
The process of claim 6, wherein the yarn is 
nylon 6,6. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the yarn is a 
continuous multifilament yarn. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the yarn is a 
staple spun yarn.
