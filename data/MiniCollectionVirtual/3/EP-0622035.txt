<ABSTRACT>
A cosmetic applicator system including a container for storing a 
fluid cosmetic material such as eyeliner, and an applicator having a 

hollow stem formed with a reservoir, a felt applicator tip with a body 
portion inserted in the distal end of the stem (16), and a plurality of 

longitudinal channels (34) extending along the passage in surrounding 
relation to the body portion of the tip (17) for conducting liquid 

cosmetic material from the container to the reservoir when the tip (17) 
is immersed in the container, and from the reservoir to the tip when the 

applicator is used to apply the cosmetic material after withdrawal from 
the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems for applying a fluid
cosmetic material, and more particularly to an applicator system
including an applicator having a product reservoir in communication
with a semi-rigid tip for extended and precise application of a
fluid cosmetic product such as eyeliner.As used herein, the term "fluid cosmetic material" means a
cosmetic material comprising a liquid vehicle, typically having
particulate solid components such as pigments dispersed therein,
and capable of flowing as a fluid. Present-day eyeliner compositions
are examples of such materials, especially suitable for use
with the present invention.Eyeliner applicator systems which currently are available have
many drawbacks. The eyeliner product of one current system is
stored in a container or reservoir, and the applicator tip is made
from flexible fibers. In use, the applicator is inserted into the
reservoir and absorbs an amount of product for use. The user
brushes the product onto the eye to create a draw line, similar to
a paint brush.Because the fiber applicator tip of this system is flexible,
the user's skill and sensitivity to application pressure are
determinative factors in controlling the width of the draw line.
If the user cannot aptly control the application pressure, the
fiber tip may flare, resulting in a variable width of the draw
line. This creates an irregular appearance and usually requires
the user to remove the makeup and repeat the application.Another drawback to the flexible fiber applicator system is
that the applicator can carry only a small amount of product, often
less than is necessary to create a complete draw line with a single
stroke. Thus, the user frequently must interrupt each eyeliner 
application to reload more product, by reinserting the
applicator into the reservoir. Additionally, flexible
fiber applicators are difficult and costly to assemble.Some years ago, pen type applicators were introduced
in the market to alleviate the problems encountered with
the flexible fiber applicators. The pen type applicator is
fed from an internal reservoir, similar to a fountain pen.
The applicator tip is made from a porous material,
typically foam. The tip is shaped for controlled
application and is structurally supported internally by a
fibrous wick. The wick also transfers product from the
internal reservoir to the tip by capillary action.Although the pen type applicator systems solves may
problems inherent in the flexible fiber applicators, the
pen type system nevertheless has many significant
drawb

<CLAIMS>
A system for applying a fluid cosmetic material,
including:


(a) means (10) for defining a first reservoir (11) for
holding a body of the cosmetic material (14), and

having an opening for access to the first reservoir;
and
(b) an applicator (12) for transporting quantities of
the cosmetic material from the first reservoir to a

user's face, the applicator having a stem (16) with
a distal end (16a) insertable through the opening

into contact with the cosmetic material in the first
reservoir, and a tip (17) having a nib portion (18)

exposed at the distal end of the stem for applying
the cosmetic material to the face; wherein


(i) said applicator has a second reservoir (22)
spaced from said distal end for receiving a

quantity of the cosmetic material,
(ii) said stem has a passage (26) communicating

between the second reservoir and said distal
end, and
(iii) said tip has a body portion (30) inserted in
said passage and cooperating therewith to

define a path for flow of the cosmetic material
between said distal end and said second

reservoir, through said passage and externally
of said body portion, such that cosmetic

material flows from the first reservoir to the 
second reservoir when said distal end is in

contact with the cosmetic material in the first
reservoir, and flows from the second reservoir

to the nib portion during subsequent
application of cosmetic material from the nib

portion to a user's face or like application
locality.
A system as defined in claim 1, wherein said path
comprises a plurality of channels (34) spaced around and

extending along said body portion in said passage.
A system as defined in claim 2, wherein said stem is
formed with a plurality of internal longitudinal splines

(32), spaced around said passage and engaging said body
portion of said tip, for defining therewith said

channels.
A system as defined in claim 2 or claim 3, wherein
said channels open through said distal end such that

cosmetic material from said second reservoir flows
therethrough over the nib portion.
A system as defined in any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said applicator defines a vent (24) for

equalizing pressure between said second reservoir and
ambient atmosphere.
A system as defined in any one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein said tip is a formed synthetic felt body having

sufficient rigidity so that said nib portion is self-sustaining
in shape under manual cosmetic-applying

pressures. 
A system as defined in any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the tip is formed from synthetic felt.
A system as defined in any one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein the distal end is hollow.
A system as defined in any one of claims 1 to 8,
wherein said stem comprises a manually graspable proximal

end (16b) that protrudes from said container opening when
said distal end is fully inserted therein.
A cosmetic material applicator (12) having a cosmetic
material reservoir (22) and a tip (17) inserted in the body

of the applicator, wherein said tip has a nib portion (18)
and a body portion (30), which body portion defines with a

surface of the applicator a path for flow of cosmetic
material from said reservoir externally of said body

portion to said nib portion or vice versa, wherein said
path comprises a plurality of channels (34) designed by a

plurality of longitudinal splines (32) formed on the
surface of the applicator and engaging said body portion of

said tip.
A cosmetic material applicator as claimed in claim 10
wherein:


(a) said applicator has a stem (16) with a distal end
insertable into a container (10) for contact with a

fluid cosmetic material contained therein; and
(b) said nib portion is exposed at the distal end of the
stem for applying the cosmetic material to a user's

face; wherein 

(i) said cosmetic material reservoir (22), optionally
formed in said stem, is spaced from said distal end

for receiving a quantity of the cosmetic material,
(ii) said stem has a passage (26) communicating
between the cosmetic material reservoir and said

distal end, and
(iii) said body portion (30) is inserted in said
passage and cooperates therewith to define a path for

flow of the cosmetic material between said distal end
and said cosmetic material reservoir, through said

passage and externally of said body portion, such that
cosmetic material flows from the container to the

cosmetic material reservoir when said distal end is in
contact with the cosmetic material in the container,

and flows from the cosmetic material reservoir to the
nib portion during subsequent application of cosmetic

material from the nib portion to a user's face or like
application locality.
An applicator as defined in claim 10 or claim 11 and
further defined by the specific feature of any one or more

of claims 4 to 9, optionally for use with a container
holding a body of a fluid cosmetic material.
