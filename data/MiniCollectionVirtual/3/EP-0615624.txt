<ABSTRACT>
In order to set the optimum transmission frequency in a distance measuring equipment working according to the echo-sounding principle with sonic or ultra-sonic pulses, the transmission frequency is gradually changed in a predetermined frequency range. During each reception interval following the transmission of a sonic or ultra-sonic pulse, the amplitude-time profile of the reception signals is formed and integrated. The integration values obtained for the various transmission frequencies are stored and the frequency for which the maximum integration value was obtained is set as optimum transmission frequency. In order to eliminate the influence of noise on the determination of the optimum transmission frequency, the mean noise amplitude of the reception signals is determined and deduced from the amplitude-time profile of the reception signals before its integration.

A process for setting the transmission frequency of a 
distance measuring instrument operating according to the 

echo-sounding principle, including at least one electro-acoustic 
transducer for emitting sonic or ultrasonic pulses 

and for converting received sonic or ultrasonic signals into 
electric received signals, a frequency-adjustable oscillator 

for generating an electric signal having the transmission 
frequency of the sonic or ultrasonic pulses which are to be 

transmitted for activating the electro-acoustic transducer, 
and an evaluation circuit for determining the travelling 

time of the sonic or ultrasonic pulses as a measure of the 
distance of a target object, the optimum transmission 

frequency being determined and tuned in the oscillator by 
analysing received signals obtained at different transmission 

frequencies, characterised in that during the 
analysis of the received signals in each reception interval 

following the emission of a sonic or ultrasonic pulse the 
amplitude-time-profile of the received signals is formed and 

integrated, that the integrated values obtained for different 
transmission frequencies are stored and that the frequency 

at which the maximum integrated value is attained is 
set in the oscillator as the optimum transmission frequency. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
envelope of the received signals is scanned in order to form 

each amplitude-time-profile, that the scanned values are 
digitised and that the digitised scanned values are stored.  

 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the mean noise amplitude of the received signals is 

determined and that the difference between the amplitude-time-profile 
of the received signals and the mean noise 

amplitude is integrated. 
A process according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
noise amplitude of the received signals is determined at a 

time at which no echo signals attributable to a transmitted 
sonic or ultrasonic pulse are received. 
A process according to claim 3, characterised in that for 
determining the mean noise amplitude the amplitude-time-profile 

of the received signals is formed during a receiving 
interval prior to which no emission of a sonic or ultrasonic 

pulse has occurred, and that the mean amplitude values of 
the amplitude-time-profile are determined. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the received signals are passed 

through a band filter tuned to the frequency of the 
oscillator prior to the formation of the amplitude-time-profile. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the analysis of the received signals 

for the determination of the optimum transmission frequency 
is conducted during frequency control intervalls during 

which no distance measurement takes place. 
A process according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
transmission frequency is adjusted stepwise during each 

frequency control interval, within a predetermined frequency 
range commencing from a starting frequency.  

 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a substitute frequency is set in the 

oscillator whenever the determination of an optimum transmission 
frequency by analysis of the received signals is not 

feasible. 
A process according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the substitute frequency is determined on the basis of a 

measurement of the temperature of the electro-acoustic 
transducer as a function of a given temperature characteristic 

of the transducer.
