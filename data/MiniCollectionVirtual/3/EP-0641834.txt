<CLAIMS>
Soundproofing material based on a bituminous 
composition which consists substantially of a mixture 

consisting of: 

40 to 70% by weight of oxidised bitumen; 
30 to 60% by weight of conjugated styrene-diene block 
copolymers; 
0 to 10% by weight of usage oil, 
 
the total representing 100% by weight of the mixture and a 

mineral filler representing 50 to 85% by weight of the 
composition, 
characterised in that
 styrene-butadiene-styrene 
block copolymers with a radial structure are used, 

the styrene content of which is between 20 and 35% by 
weight. 
Use of a sound-proofing material according to claim 1 
in the car industry, for soundproofing of vehicles.
