<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording 
medium having excellent running stability, signal recording 
property and applicability to high-speed dubbing. Recording onto a VTR tape has been mostly carried out 
in a video tape recorder. For example, a TV program is 
videotaped by a home VTR tape deck, or a person, scene, or 
the like is videotaped by a handy VTR camera. The tape 
speed in recording (same as in playback) has been 3.335 
cm/sec in the case of VHS system and 1.4345 cm/sec in the 
case of 8 mm video system, and even during high-speed 
searching (quick feed or rewind in the playback mode), the 
tape speed has been not more than several times the normal 
speed. In recent years, owing to a reduction in price of the 
recorded video tapes, it has become popular to record by 
using a high-speed dubbing (duplicating) machine. The 
following two systems of high-speed dubbing are currently 
used: thermomagnetic transfer recording system using laser 
light, and system in which the magnetic field is inverted by 
applying a biased magnetic field. It is common to both 
systems, that the tape speed is as high as 4 to 5 m/sec, 
which is more than 100 times the tape speed in the ordinary 
home VTR tape deck. This enabled a notable reduction in 
price of recorded video tapes as compared with the case 
where equal-speed dubbing is conducted.  The VTR tape used here, after recorded with a high-speed 
dubbing machine, is played back repeatedly by an 
ordinary home VTR tape deck, so that the VTR tape is 
required to have high quality equal to a large-screen TV 
display. The VTR tapes of the conventional design, although 
having good properties for repetitive recording and playback 
by a home VTR tape deck, are liable to increase of dropout 
due to chipping of the tape in recording by a high-speed 
dubbing machine, resulting in a serious problem on practical 
use of these tapes. Its cause is not definitely known, but 
difference in mechanism of chipping depending on the tape 
speed is supposed. Various methods have been proposed for 
the improvement in this respect, but it has been unable to 
provide a VTR tape which can meet both requirements for high 
chipping resistance when the VTR tape is used for a high-speed 
dubbing machine, and high-quality regeneration of the 
record by a home VTR tape deck. As a result of the present inventors' studies for 
solving the above problems, it has been found that by using 
as a surface layer of a coextruded base film, a polyester 
layer having a thickness of 0.05
