<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cable entry seal in which an annular seal (7) which is constructed in the form of a cone or tapered body and consists of elastic material is pressed against the entry opening, which is likewise constructed in the form of a cone or tapered body. The annular seal (7) is pressed in with the aid of a pressure medium (14, 23 - 24) in the axial direction. The annular seal (7) is preferably provided with a longitudinally running slot (16), so that it can also be used for uncut cables.

<CLAIMS>
Cable inlet seal, comprising an annular seal (7), 
made from an elastic material, and an inlet opening (5, 

22), adapted thereto, in the cable inlet region of a 
cable accessory, the cable inlet opening (5, 22) being 

constructed in a conically converging fashion, the 
annular seal (7) being adapted at least on the outside to 

the conical course of the cable inlet opening (5, 22), 
and a pressure means (14, 23) acting in the axial direction 

on the annular seal (7) being arranged at the wide 
end of the cable inlet opening (5, 22), characterized in 

that the cable inlet opening (5) is arranged in the 
parting plane (4) of a longitudinally split cable accessory 

or the sealing member (1) of the latter, and in that 
the shells (2) of the split cable accessory or the 

submembers of a sealing member (1) are pressed against 
one another by means of screws or latching closures, an 

interlayer made from sealing material, preferably a 
profiled seal (10), being inserted. 
Cable inlet seal according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the pressure means is a ring nut (14) which 

can be screwed axially into a thread (21) at the wide end 
of the cable inlet opening (5, 22). 
Cable inlet seal according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the pressure means is formed by a pressure 

plate (23) which is provided with a projection (24) and 
can thereby be pressed into the wide end of the cable 

inlet opening (5, 22) in a fashion acting axially on the 
annular seal (7). 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that at least one cable  

 
inlet opening (6) is arranged outside the parting plane 

(4) of a longitudinally split cable accessory or the 
sealing member (1) of the latter. 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the annular seal (7) 

consists of rubber, preferably silicone rubber. 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the annular seal (7) is 

sealed like a cap at the conically tapering end. 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the annular seal (7) is 

longitudinally split or longitudinally slit. 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that an annular washer is 

inserted between the annular surface at the wide end of 
the annular seal (7) and the pressure means (14, 23-24). 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a pressure spring 

insert (15) is arranged between the annular surface at 
the wide end of the annular seal (7) and the pressure 

means (14, 23-24). 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the cable inlet opening 

is drawn forward like a stub as a cable support (18) at 
the outer end of the cable accessory. 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the pressure means (14) 

comprises two longitudinally split halves which can be 
fixed to one another via fixing means, preferably a film 

hinge, latching cams or guide cams. 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the surfaces of the 

annular seal are moistened with fat or oil. 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the conical formations 

of the cable inlet openings (5, 22) and of the annular 
seal (7) extend outwardly in a tapering fashion. 
Cable inlet seal according to one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that a common sealing groove 
(11) is arranged in the parting plane (4) of a longitudinally 

split cable accessory or sealing memeber (1) of the 
latter, in which groove the profiled seal (10) of the 

parting plane (4) and the annular seal (7), preferably 
with an integrally formed rib (12) are pressed tightly 

together.
