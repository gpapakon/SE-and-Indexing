<DESCRIPTION>
 DYNAMIC FILTER SYSTEMTechnical Field The present invention relates to a dynamic filter assembly and, in particular, to a an improved dynamic filter assembly and filter unit.Background of the InventionA disk-type dynamic filter assembly typically includes a housing which contains a filter unit comprising one or more filter elements and a rotary unit comprising one or more members. The filter elements of the filter unit and the members of the rotary unit may have any of a variety of suitable configurations. Very often, the filter unit comprises a stack of flat, disk-shaped filter elements while the rotary unit comprises a stack of flat rotary disks. The rotary disks are interleaved between the filter elements with a gap maintained between each filter element and rotary disk and the rotary disks are arranged to rotate with respect to the filter elements.While the rotary disks are rotating, a process fluid is pumped into the housing through a process fluid inlet. The process fluid then passes through the gaps between the rotary disks and the filter element. Part of the process fluid, i.e. , the permeate, passes through the filter elements and exits the housing through a permeate outlet. The remainder of the process fluid ,i.e, the retentate, 

 exits the housing through a retentate outlet.The relative rotation of the rotary disks in the filter elements causes the process fluid in the gaps between the rotary disks and the filter elements to sweep the surface of the filter elements. Debris is thus prevented from accumulating on the surface of the filter elements and fouling or clogging of the filter elements is minimized. This extends the useful life of the filter elements.While conventional disk-type dynamic filter assemblies have proven very effective, they nevertheless have several disadvantages. For example, although the useful life of the filter elements in a dynamic filter assembly may be extended, the filter elements will eventually become sufficiently fouled or clogged with debris to. require removal. Unfortunately, removal of the filter elements can be exceedingly difficult. Conventional filter elements may comprise a portion of the housing itself and access to each of the filter elements may require complete disassembly of the entire dynamic filter assembly, including the filter unit and the rotational unit.. Furthermore, mechanisms for attaching filter media to the filter elements further add to the complexity and intricacy of conventional dynamic assemblies. Because of the number of components of
