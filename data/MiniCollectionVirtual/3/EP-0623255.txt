<ABSTRACT>
A disk spindle motor (200) having a permanent magnet central shaft (202). A pair of annular, non-magnetic combination thrust and journal bearings (204A, 204B) having truncated-conical outer surfaces (204') are spaced apart on the shaft (202). The bearings coact with complementary surfaces (210, 211) on the hub (209) of a motor rotor (208). Shaft end caps (206A, 206B) connect the shaft to base means (218) and have radially extending shoulders (206'') which define annular gaps (225', 225'') with the rotor and function as ferrofluidic seals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bearing cartridges, and in particular to bearing 
cartridges having a ferrofluid lubricant. The use of ferrofluid bearings as an alternative to ball bearings is disclosed in 
U.S. Patent 4,734,606 by the inventor of the present invention. 
Ferrofluid bearings have provided particular advantages over 
ball bearings when used in magnetic disk storage systems. More specifically, 
ferrofluid bearings tend to produce less audible noise than ball bearings. 
Furthermore, the use of ferrofluid bearings instead of ball bearings eliminates 
vibration produced by the inner ball bearing race, the outer ball bearing race and the 
ball bearings. Additional relevant prior art are French patent 2,313,592 and US 
patent 3,701,912. The former teaches a conically shaped bearing for a motor. Patent 
3,701,912 shows a bearing structure with a magnetic lubricant and with magnetic 
means to retain the lubricant in the bearing at rest. The use of a ferrofluid bearing in a disk spindle motor improves several 
performance factors of a magnetic disk storage device. Ferrofluid bearings tend to 
reduce or attenuate vibration originating in other parts of the disk storage device. In 
addition, ferrofluid bearings tend to have lower electrical resistance between the outer 
race and the inner race than ball bearings thereby providing a better discharge path to 
more rapidly dissipate any electrostatic charge that builds up on the disk surface. 
Furthermore, ferrofluid bearings tend to have a larger surface area between the 
bearing races over which to distribute shock loads, thereby withstanding mechanical 
shock better. The ever increasing demands for greater memory capacity, lower production 
costs, faster memory access times, decreased size and weight of disk storage devices 
has placed increasing demands on the performance of the disk spindle devices.  
 It is therefore an object of this invention to 
provide a novel disk spindle motor with improved performance 
factors such as reduced drag characteristics, 
improved ferrofluid containment and rediced manufacturing 
costs. These and other objects are achieved in an apparatus 
comprising disk spindle motor elements and components 
in combination according to claim 1. Additional 
embodiments, advantages and improvements may be taken 
from the subclaims. The present invention is a bearing cartridge that 
includes a shaft defining both an axis and a first bearing 
race. The bearing cartridge includes a hub that is 
capable of axial rotation relative to
