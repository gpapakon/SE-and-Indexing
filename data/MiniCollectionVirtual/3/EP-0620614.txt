<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly for 
terminating a multi-conductor cable (20) includes a 

cover block member (32) with grooves (52) each for 
holding a respective one of the cable conductors (54). 

The grooves (53) extend along three sides of the generally 
rectangular cover block member (32) so that the conductors 

may be wrapped thereabout. A housing (24) containing 
insulation displacement contacts (34) is pressed against 

the cover block member (32) to engage the cable conductors (54) 
and a pair of metal backshells (26, 28) are fastened 

together over both the cover block member (32) and the 
housing (24) to hold them together. The metal backshells (26,28) 

are also crimped over the cable (20) to provide primary strain 
relief therefore. The bending of the conductors (54) around 

the cover block member (32) serves two functions - it 
provides partial strain relief for the conductors (54) around 

assembly and it prevents the exposed wire ends of the 
conductors (54) from contacting the metal backshell (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors 
and, more particularly, to a connector which aligns the 
insulated conductors of a multi-conductor cable with 
insulation displacement contacts in a minimal amount of 
space and provides partial strain relief to the 
conductors during the assembly operation. In the past, the connection of a wire to a contact 
terminal was conventionally done by means of a crimping 
operation. This operation requires that the wire be 
trimmed, stripped of a predetermined length of 
insulation at its free end, placed next to the contact 
terminal, and then folding the crimp tabs of the contact 
terminal over the bare wire. It is readily apparent 
that this connection procedure involves a large number 
of steps and requires precise positioning. When a 
multi-conductor cable is terminated to a connector, 
these steps must be repeated for each and every one of 
the conductors. To alleviate some of these 
shortcomings, in recent years the use of insulation 
displacement contacts has become increasingly popular. 
Such contacts generally have at one end thereof an 
insulation displacing part which has a longitudinal slit 
into which an insulation covered conductor is press 
fitted. The edges of the slit displace the insulation 
and make contact with the underlying wire. While such a 
contact is generally satisfactory in an electrical 
sense, it suffers from the disadvantage that it does not 
achieve, by itself, a good mechanical bond. 
Accordingly, the mechanical bond between the conductor 
and the contact terminal must be attained through some 
independent means. The present invention is particularly concerned 
with an in-line plug connector having insulation 
displacement contacts for terminating a multi-conductor 
cable. With such a connector, movement of the connector  
 
when being mated with or separated from a complementary 
mating connector is in a direction generally along the 
length of the cable. Those of skill in the art will 
recognize that in many applications the internal space 
for terminating the wires in an in-line plug connector 
is limited when compared, for example, with a plug 
connector which is offset 90° from the cable direction. 
It is therefore a primary object of this invention to 
provide a connector of the type described which does not 
require much internal space for terminating the cable 
conductors. In an in-line plug connector of the type described, 
if during the assembly operation the cable is pulled 
before the primary strain relief is

An electrical connector assembly for 
terminating a cable (20) having a predetermined number 

of insulation covered conductors (54), comprising: 
   an insulating termination cover block member (32) 

of generally rectangular cross section and formed with 
said predetermined number of parallel grooves (52) each 

adapted to hold a respective one of the conductors, each 
of said grooves extending along three sides of said 

cover block member so that each groove has a middle 
section and two substantially parallel end sections each 

substantially perpendicular to the middle section, 
whereby a conductor held in a groove has two 

substantially right angle bends; 
   a predetermined number of terminals (34) each 

having a contacting part (44) for contacting a 
contacting part of a mating connector and an insulation 

displacing part (46) for connection to a respective one 
of the conductors; 

   an insulating housing (24) for holding said 
terminals so that said insulation displacing parts 

project outwardly from a first end thereof and said 
contacting parts are accessible at a second end thereof 

opposite said first end; characterized by 
   said cover block member (32) and said housing (24) 

being formed with complementary mating formations so 
that said cover block member and said housing may be 

aligned and held together in a defined orientation with 
said housing first end being adjacent to the conductors 

between the conductor bends; and 
   clamp means (26, 28) for holding said cover block 

member (32) and said housing (24) together so that each 
of said insulation displacing parts (46) is connected to 

a respective one of the conductors (54), wherein the 
conductors are wrapped on the cover block to position 

insulation on the conductors between the clamp means and 
 

wire ends of the conductors to prevent the clamp means 
from contacting the wire ends. 
The assembly according to Claim 1 wherein said 
clamp means is arranged to tightly grip the conductors 

externally of said cover block member grooves (52) so as 
to provide strain relief for the conductors.

cover block member (32) is formed with a recess (56) for 

accepting said insulation displacing parts (46) between 
the conductor bends. 
The assembly according to Claim 1 wherein said 
terminals (34) are held in said housing (24) in two rows 

with said insulation displacing parts (46) in each of 
said rows being spaced at twice the spacing of the 

conductors so that the insulation displacing parts in 
each of said rows connects to alternate ones of the 

conductors. 
The assembly according to Claim 4 wherein said 
cover block member (32) is formed with two recesses (56) 

between the conductor bends, each of said two recesses 
accepting the insulation displacing parts (46) in a 

respective one of said rows. 
The assembly according to Claim 4 wherein said 
terminals (34) are identical, with the terminals in a 

first of said rows being inverted with respect to the 
terminals in a second of said rows, each of said

   a connecting portion (50) connecting said main body 
portion (40) to said auxiliary body portion (46) in such 

a manner that when said terminal is installed in said 
housing said insulation displacing part is offset from 

 
said longitudinal axis by half the spacing of said 

conductors.
