<ABSTRACT>
The present method encompasses the cyclical control of extrusion presses and therefore permits the precise control of an extrusion press so as to achieve a maximum throughput while at the same time achieving optimum quality in the extruded sections. For this purpose, the extrusion speed is controlled in such a way that the strand exit temperature is as constant as possible and identical with a predetermined desired-value characteristic. The variation of the extrusion speed and the strand exit temperature is recorded for each cycle k, the dependence of the strand exit temperature on the extrusion speed is determined for the entire time characteristic during a cycle k, this dependence and the time characteristic of the extrusion speed during the cycle k is used to determine the characteristic of the extrusion speed for the next cycle k+1 in such a way that the control error and the actuating effort are reduced as far as possible and, on completion of extrusion cycle k+1, the corresponding method steps are repeated recursively for each further extrusion cycle until the entire extrusion operation is complete. The method is suitable particularly for the production of extruded sections with a low emission level and/or an emission level dependent on wavelength and/or variable surface characteristics and, in particular, for the production of extruded sections from aluminium or aluminium alloys.
