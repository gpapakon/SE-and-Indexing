<ABSTRACT>
The invention identifies the CTLA4 receptor as a ligand for 
the B7 antigen. The complete amino acid sequence encoding 

human CTLA4 receptor gene is provided. Methods are provided 
for expressing CTLA4 as an immunoglobulin fusion protein, for 

preparing hybrid CTLA4 fusion proteins, and for using the 
soluble fusion proteins, fragments and derivatives thereof, 

including monoclonal antibodies reactive with B7 and CTLA4, to 
regulate T cell interactions and immune responses mediated by 

such interactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising a B7-binding molecule and
an IL4-binding molecule as well as the use of a B7-binding molecule and an IL4-binding
molecule for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for regulating immune
responses.The present invention also describes the express ion of the CTLA4 receptor
gene, identification of the interaction between the receptor and
cells expressing B7 antigen, and to methods for regulating cellular
interactions involving the CTLA4 receptor and the B7 antigen.The hallmark of a vertebrate immune system is the ability to
discriminate "self" from "non-self" (foreign). This property has
led to the evolution of a system requiring multiple signals to
achieve optimal immune activation (Janeway, Cold Spring Harbor
Symp. Quant. Biol. 54:1-14 (1989)). T cell-B cell interactions are
essential to the immune response. Levels of many cohesive
molecules found on T cells and B cells increase during an immune
response (Springer et al., (1987), supra; Shaw and Shimuzu, Current
Opinion in Immunology, Eds. Kindt and Long, 1:92-97 (1988)); and
Hemler Immunology Today 9:109-113 (1988)). Increased levels of
these molecules may help explain why activated B cells are more
effective at stimulating antigen-specific T cell proliferation than
are resting B cells (Kaiuchi et al., J. Immunol. 131:109-114 
(1983); Kreiger et al., J. Immunol. 135:2937-2945 (1985); McKenzie,
J. Immunol. 141:2907-2911 (1988); and Hawrylowicz and Unanue, J.
Immunol. 141:4083-4088 (1988)).The generation of a T lymphocyte ("T cell") immune response is a
complex process involving cell-cell interactions (Springer et al.,
A. Rev. Immunol. 5:223-252 (1987)), particularly between T and
accessory cells such as B cells, and production of soluble immune
mediators (cytokines or lymphokines) (Dinarello and Mier, New Engl.
Jour. Med 317:940-945 (1987)). This response is regulated by
several T-cell surface receptors, including the T-cell receptor
complex (Weiss et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 4:593-619 (1986)) and
other "accessory" surface molecules (Springer et al., (1987)
supra). Many of these accessory molecules are naturally occurring
cell surface differentiation (CD) antigens defined by the
reactivity of monoclonal antibodies on the surface of cells
(McMichael, Ed., Leukocyte Typing III, Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford,
N.Y. (1987)).Antigen-independent intercellular interactions involving lymphocyte
accessory molecules are essential for an immune response (Springer
et al., (1987), supra). For example, binding of the
