<ABSTRACT>
Method for applying an energy-storing flywheel (2) with pre-tension with an inner bore on a coaxial support (16) rotating symmetrically with the latter and having a tapering outer surface, in which a ring (22a, 22b, 22c, 22d) is placed in the flywheel bore with a tapering inner surface, of which the taper corresponds with that of the support (16) and the entire unit thus obtained is shifted on the support (16) until the desired pre-tension is obtained. In accordance with the invention both the inner bore of the flywheel (18a, 18b, 18c, 18d) and the outer surface of the ring (22a, 22b, 22c, 22d), which co-operate, have a design with a corresponding taper. Furthermore, the invention includes a clamping ring (22a), which can be used when using this method, having a tapering inner surface, the outer surface, intended for functioning with the flywheel being also conical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for fixing a 
energy-storing flywheel with pre-tension with an inner bore 
on a coaxial support rotating symmetrically with the latter 
and having a tapering outer surface, in which a ring is 
placed in the flywheel bore, said ring having a tapering 
inner surface, of which the taper corresponds with that of 
the support and the entire unit thus obtained is shifted on 
the support until the desired pre-tension is obtained. Such a method is known from EP-A- 0 137 759. The 
ring used in this known method has a cylindrical outer 
surface, fitting within the cylindrical bore of the 
flywheel, and is provided with a number of incisions 
running over the greatest part over its length. A 
consequence thereof is that the ring is elastically 
deformable in a radial direction due to changes in the 
widths of the incisions, with which it is intended to 
accomplish, that by placing the ring with the tapered inner 
bore on the tapered rotating symmetrical support, the outer 
surface in contact with the inner bore of the flywheel 
deflects outwards, thereby generating radial compressive 
stress in the flywheel. The objection to this known method is that the 
presence of the longitudinal incisions, as a result of 
changes in their width, results in surface damage to the 
flywheel bore, and therefore in stress concentrations that 
could have fatal results at a high rotational speed, while 
the radial pre-tension attainable with this known method is 
still insufficient to avoid delamination of the flywheel 
when operating at extremely high rotational or peripheral 
velocities respectively in the order of 500-600 m/s. The aim of this invention is to overcome this 
objection. In accordance with the invention this aim is 
achieved by designing both the inner bore of the flywheel  
 
and the co-operating outer surface of the ring, with a 
corresponding taper. These measures result in an uninterrupted outer 
surface of the ring, so that the chance of damage to the 
inner bore of the flywheel is nil. Furthermore, a 
considerably higher pre-tension can be achieved, which 
means that higher flywheel rotational velocities are 
possible. Preferred embodiments of the method in accordance with 
the invention are described in claims 2-3, while a unit comprising 
an energy-storing flywheel as defined in the preamble of claim 4 as shown in EP-A- 0 137 759 
is characterised by the measures defined in the characterising 
clause of this claim, preferred embodiments being subject of claims 5-8. The
