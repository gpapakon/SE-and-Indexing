<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a decoder, and
more particularly, to a decoder suitable for decoding error
correction codes of Goppa code including Reed Solomon (RS)
code and Bose-Chaudhuru-Hocqenghem (BCH) code.In order to promote reliability of various digital
systems, it has become to apply error correction codes in
recent years. Various kinds of error correction codes have
been adopted corresponding to various systems.In particular, Reed Solomon code (hereinafter referred to
as RS code) is an important code of which redundancy is low
and is widely used in the fields of CD (Compact Disk), DAT
(Digital Audio Tape) and satellite communication.There are various methods proposed for decoding RS code.
For correction of a few symbols. for instance, two or three
symbols it is possible to obtain error locations and error
values by an algebraic function using RS code and it is easy
to devise a decoder for this purpose. However, in a system
requiring high reliability it is necessary to increase the
error correction capability. In this case, the Peterson
algorithm, the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm or the Euclid's
algorithm is used. In these algorithms, the decoding is made
by setting up error locator polynomials and error evaluator
polynomials and obtaining error locations and error values
according to the Chien searcher. Circuits for enabling such 
the decoding as this are extremely large in scale and
furthermore, require a long time for calculation.Next, the RS code will be briefly described.The RS code comprises Galois field GF elements. If a
code length is n, the minimum distance (Hamming distance) is
d. and information bearing symbols are k of a RS code on
Galois field GF(2m) comprising 2m elements. the RS code
satisfies the following equations (1) and (2):
n ≦ 2m -1n = k + (d - 1)The error correction capability t of this RS code can be
expressed by the following equation (3):
t = (d - 1)/2A generator polynomial G(X) has degrees equivalent to
code check symbols (n-k) (= d-1 = 2t) and is divisible Xn-1.
If the primitive element of GF(2m) is α, the generator
polynomial G(X) of the RS code can be expressed by the
following equation (4):
G(X) = (X - α) • (X - α2) ... (X - α2t)Further, G(X) can optionally be replaced by the following
equation (5).
G(X) = (X - 1) • (X - α) ... (X - α2t-1)Next, the encoding will be described.A coding polynomial C(X) after encoded must be divisible
by a generator polynomial G (X). If information symbol of k
pieces desirable to encode is I and this information is 
expressed
