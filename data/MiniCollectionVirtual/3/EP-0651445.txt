<ABSTRACT>
A GTO with a cathode emitter (7) is specified, which cathode emitter has a weak emission efficiency. By virtue of this cathode emitter (7), a considerably increased resistance against formation of current filaments is obtained. As a result of this, relatively high turn-off current densities can be reliably controlled. In addition, the proportion of the hole current with respect to the total current is more than 10%. This is achieved, for example, by selecting the penetration depth

 1  mu m and the edge concentration
