<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a procedure for fabricating a constructional unit of a pressure transmitting diaphragm which has a flat, concentrically corrugated diaphragm and a metallic base body (4). Designed in the base body (4) is a flat cutout whose bottom forms a concentrically corrugated diaphragm bed (30). To fabricate this constructional unit, a flat, still uncorrugated diaphragm blank (40) is pressed against a joining surface surrounding the cutout, solder being arranged between the joining surface and the diaphragm blank. This arrangement is heated to a temperature above the melting point of the solder and is then cooled once more, so that the solder, which has then solidified, connects the joining surface and a marginal portion (14) of the diaphragm blank firmly to each other. After this, the central portion (46), lying opposite the membrane bed (30), of the diaphragm blank is moved into the cutout until in flush contact on the diaphragm bed (30), the central portion being elastically and plastically deformed and, on the basis of its plastic deformation, permanently assuming a corrugation which is complementary to the corrugation of the diaphragm bed.

Method for manufacturing a component of a membrane 
pressure transmitter which has a shallow, 

concentrically corrugated membrane (6) and also a main 
body (4) having a joint area (12) to which the membrane 

(6) is joined along its peripheral region (14), the main 
body (4) having, on its side facing the membrane (6), a 

shallow recess having a bottom which has a surface which 
is corrugated in a manner complementary to the corrugation 

of the membrane and forms a membrane bed (30) for 
the membrane (6), the metallic main body (4) having a 

higher thermal coefficient of expansion than the metallic 
membrane (6) and the method comprising the steps that the 

corrugated membrane bed (30) is formed on the main body 
(4), that the corrugation is formed on an initially flat 

membrane blank (40) and that the joint between the joint 
area (12) of the main body (4) and the peripheral region 

(14) of the membrane (6) is made by soldering by means of 
a solder, the main body (4) and the solder (42) being 

heated to a temperature above the solder melting point 
during the soldering and the solder joining the joint 

area (12) and the peripheral region (14) firmly together 
after it solidifies, characterized by the steps 


a) that the flat membrane blank (40) is applied to 
the joint area (12) with the solder (42) inbetween, 
b) that during the subsequent heating, the peripheral 
region (14) is pressed in the direction of the 

joint area (12) for the purpose of soldering the peripheral 
region (14), 
c) that the main body (4), the solder (42) and the  
 

membrane blank (40) are then cooled to a temperature 
below the solder melting point, and 
d) that that central region (46) of the membrane 
blank (40) which adjoins the recess in the main body (4) 

is then impressed into the recess until it rests against 
the corrugation valleys (34) of the membrane bed (30). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the central region (46) of the membrane blank (40) 

is pressed in step d) by means of a tool (48; 52) against 
the membrane bed (30). 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the tool is composed of a rubber-elastic material 

and has a flat tool stamping face. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the tool (48) is composed of a rigid material and 

has a tool stamping face (50) which is formed in a 
complementary fashion to the corrugation of the corrugated 

membrane (6) . 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the tool stamping face is provided with a surface 

layer composed of an elastic material. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the tool is a hydraulic tool (52) which has a wall 

(56) composed of an elastic material which has, on its 
one side, a flat tool stamping face (58) and, on its 

other side, a chamber (60) filled with hydraulic fluid is 
fo
rmed, the pressure of the hydraulic fluid being brought 
to a high enough value in step d) for the elastic wall 

(56) to press the central region (46) of the membrane 
blank (40) against the membrane bed (30). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the central region (46) of the membrane blank (40) 

is pressed in step d) against the membrane bed (30) as a 
result of a pressure difference between a gas pressure in 

the recess and a gas pressure on that side of the membrane 
blank (40) which is remote from the recess. 
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the recess is evacuated in step d).
