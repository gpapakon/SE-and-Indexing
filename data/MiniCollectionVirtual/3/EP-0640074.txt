<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel organic acid addition salts of a quinolone-carboxylic acid of formula (I), wherein Z is 5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid or 2-hydroxyglutaric acid. The salts are highly soluble in water and are thus suitable to prepare a stable injection in storage for a long period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organic acid
addition salts of a quinolone-carboxylic acid and a process
for preparing the same. More particularly, the present
invention concerns 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-quinoline-3-carboxylic
acid 5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylate
or 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is
highly soluble in water giving an injectable solution, its
preparation, and use in treating infectious diseases caused
by bacteria.The following quinolone-carboxylic acid of the formula:

is known in the art as having potent antibacterial
activities. This compound, 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-quinoline-3-carboxylic
acid,
generally called "Ciprofloxacin" (hereinafter, referred to as
"Ciprofloxacin") has been widely used for the treatment of
infectious diseases in mammal caused by bacteria. See, P.B.
Fernandes ed., International Symposium on Quinolones,
pp. 1-134, J.R. Porous, S.A., Barcelona, Spain (1989).Although Ciprofloxacin is very active in treating 
bacterial disease, the compound has certain disadvantages in
that it is almost insoluble or sparingly soluble in water.
This property bars the compound from formulating it into
injectable solutions.Aiming at overcoming these disadvantages, various acid
and base addition salts of Ciprofloxacin have been developed,
which can easily dissolve in water to a desired extent and do
not cause occurrence of precipitation in the resulting
solution during storage. For example, U.S. Patent
4,705,789 to Grohe et al. discloses that hydrochloride,
methanesulfonate, acetate, propionate, succinate and lactate
of Ciprofloxacin are suitable to prepare highly stable
injectables. These salts, however, cause some problems
from the pharmaceutical point of view. That is,
Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride is unstable in solution;
methanesulfonate exhibits a very low value of pH; and acetate
and propionate smell unpleasant. Ciprofloxacin lactate
tends to occur precipitation in an injection when it is
contained in the injection in an excessive amount.European Patent Publication No. 0 067 666 Al suggests to
use galacturonic acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and
gluconic acid as an acid for forming salts with Norfloxacin
or Enoxacin which do not cause such precipitation in
solution. The salts formed by adding these acids are
proven to be pharmaceutically valuable.German Patent Application Nos. P35 00 243.3 and
P35 17 709.8 disclose sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,
ethanolamine, lysine, N-methyl glucamine and arginine as
