<ABSTRACT>
An electric motor for use in power tools for 
example, is provided with means for reliably aligning the 

armature core (5) of the rotor with the commutator (6) on 
the motor shaft (9). A plurality of circumferentially 

spaced grooves (18, 31) are provided in each of the 
juxtaposed surfaces of the armature core (5) and 

commutator (6), and a sleeve (30) with a complementary 
projection (35) on either axial end is interposed between 

them with a projection press-fitted in a respective 
groove (18,31). The sleeve (30) locates the commutator 

(6) relative to the armature core (5) both angularly and 
axially, and the assembly of commutator (6), sleeve (30) 

and armature core (5) can be further secured by bonding 
with cement or an adhesion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a miniature motor of the
type commonly used in power tools, for example. It is
especially directed at such motors in which the axial
alignment of the armature and commutator is of particular
importance.In a known motor construction this requirement is
addressed by providing a projection on the commutator
core which engages one of a number of grooves provided on
the armature at predetermined circumferential positions.
However, the width of the projection and the groove may
vary, thereby making their mutual engagement difficult.
This may result in an unreliable assembly or even failure
of the joint. Also, the edge of the projection may be
chipped upon insertion into the recess, or the projection
itself broken. The creation of such chips within the
motor, or consequential reduced accuracy in the relative
positioning of the commutator and the armature may impair
the performance of the motor.The provision of a clearance between the groove and
the projection may assist the assembly operation and
reduce the likelihood of chipping or breakage of the
projection occurring. However, this can result in a
phase shift between the armature and the commutator,
leading to variations in the performance and working life
of the motors.Another problem arising in the assembly of a motor
having the above type of construction is the adjustment
of the axial length of motor components on the rotor
shaft between the motor bearings. The conventional use
of washers of different thicknesses and in various
combinations in order to make the appropriate adjustments
is a time-consuming and troublesome process. GB-A-1513502 discloses an electric motor in which a sleeve
is fitted onto the motor shaft between the armature and the
commutator. A recess formed in one end of the sleeve engages a
tongue projecting from an insulator at the adjacent end of the
armature, and a boss at the other end of the sleeve is inserted
in a positioning hole formed in an adjacent disc-shaped insulator
of the commutator.The present invention is directed at a miniature motor
construction in which the accuracy of the relative
circumferential positioning of the armature and the commutator
is improved, and the axial length of the rotor may be more
precisely controlled. It further seeks to achieve these aims in
a construction which may be easily assembled.The basic construction of an electric motor of the invention
has a tubular case closed at one end with permanent magnets
fitted to the inner wall thereof; an end cap fitted to the other
ope
