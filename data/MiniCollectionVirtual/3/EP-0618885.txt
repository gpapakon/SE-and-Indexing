<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for biologically removing 
B00 and nitrogen from wastewater by an activated sludge process 
comprising 
(1) aerating a mixture of wastewater and activated sludge in a 
first zone; (2) transferring the mixture thus treated to a separation zone in 
which activated sludge is separated from the treated water; (3) withdrawing a recycling part of the separated activated sludge 
for recycling to the first zone transferring the recycling 
part of the separated activated sludge to 
a sludge holding zone maintained under non-aeration conditions 
and holding the activated sludge in the sludge holding zone for 
a period of time sufficient to effect complete denitrification; (4) returning the total amount of the activated sludge thus treated 
to the first zone. The eutrophication of lakes, rivers and other water resources is 
receiving worldwide attention. The presence in the environment of 
nutrients, such as phosphate and nitrogen, is one of the primary 
causes of eutrophication. These nutrients promote unwanted growth of 
algae and other aquatic plants. The eutrophication of our lakes and rivers has led to increased 
demands for nutrient control in wastewater treatment plants. 
Governmental agencies have enacted increasingly stringent 
regulations controlling the amount of nutrients which can be 
discharged into receiving waters. Since conventional treatment 
processes remove only small amounts of nitrogen and phosphate, 
wastewater treatment plants will be required to change or modify 
their processes to meet these increasingly stringent regulations. 
Unfortunately, the technology to achieve the required removal 
efficiencies is lagging behind regulatory requirements. One approach for accomplishing nutrient removal is biological  
 
treatment in a modified activated sludge system without chemical 
addition. Numerous biological nutrient removal processes have been 
developed. These biological nutrient removal processes typically use 
a single sludge configuration in which the organic matter of the 
influent is used as the carbon and energy source for nitrogen and 
phosphate removal. This allows for a lower operation cost in 
comparison to multiple sludge systems and other physical-chemical 
systems. In such biological systems, removal of nitrogen from wastewater is 
conventionally done by first nitrifying (converting ammonia to 
nitrite and nitrate, NOx) and then denitrifying (reducing VOx to N₂) 
the wastewater. The process of nitrification is carried out in an 
aerobic
