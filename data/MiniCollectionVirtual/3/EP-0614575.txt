<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus
for depositing or etching film through the use of a
microwave initiated plasma and more particularly to a
microwave plasma deposition apparatus employing an improved
window assembly adapted to uniformly transmit high power
microwave energy from a source such as a waveguide into the
interior of a vacuum deposition/etch chamber.This invention window assembly has general
applicability to any type of apparatus which requires the
introduction of high power microwave energy from a source
such as a waveguide or antenna, maintained at substantially
atmospheric pressure, into the interior of a vacuum
chamber, maintained at subatmospheric pressure. The
microwave energy is introduced into the vacuum chamber for
effecting a glow discharge plasma which is utilized to
either deposit a semiconductor or insulating material onto
the exposed surface of a substrate or to remove (etch)
material from that exposed surface. Whereas the invention
window assembly has universal applicability to microwave
apparatus, the invention window assembly is especially
applicable to the fabrication of photo responsive alloys
and devices for various photoconductive applications
including the fabrication of electrophotographic photo
receptors. Alternatively, the invention window assembly
may be employed with equal advantage in association with a 
vacuum chamber adapted to etch or otherwise treat or modify
the surface of a substrate.Regardless of the type of microwave plasma
operation (deposition or etch) being conducted, the rate at
which that operation occurs can be controlled, inter alia,
by controlling the power at which the microwave energy is
transmitted into the interior of the vacuum chamber. In
order to deposit or etch at a high rate, it is necessary to
utilize high power levels, for example in the kilowatt
range and preferably three or more kilowatts. However, the
use of such high power microwave energy tends to cause
heating of the dielectric window through which the
microwave energy is coupled into the interior of the vacuum
chamber, and prolonged or excessive heating of the
dielectric window can cause cracking of the window with
resultant catastrophic failure of the deposition/etch
operation. Further, even the introduction of relatively
low microwave power into the vacuum chamber over a
relatively lengthy period of time can also cause the
dielectric window to overheat and fail.In an effort to overcome failure of the
dielectric window due to overheating, it has previously
been

<CLAIMS>
A microwave window assembly (14) for transmitting high
power microwave energy from a microwave propagating means

(10) into the interior of a chamber (12), and including first
and second windows (24,26), formed of a dielectric material

substantially transparent to microwave energy with the first
window (24) adapted to be sealed in a wall (12b) of the

chamber (12) and the second window (26) spaced rearwardly
from said first window (24) in the direction of the microwave

propagating means (10) to define a space (66) between said
first and second windows (24,26) ; means for circulating a

cooling fluid in the space (66) between said first (24) and
second (26) windows; and a waveguide (34) for transmitting

the microwave energy from the propagating means (10) to the
window assembly (14), the waveguide (34) terminating

proximate the rearward surface (26b) of the second window
(26) in an end portion (34c) of substantially uniform cross-section

which has a closed inner peripheral surface (34e),
characterised in that a waveguide surface (30d) is provided

within the space (66), the waveguide surface (30d)
corresponding in size and cross-sectional configuration to

said inner peripheral surface (34e), and being arranged so as
to constitute a forward extension of the waveguide end 

portion (34c), said waveguide surface (30d) extending from
the forward surface (26a) of the second window (26) and

terminating at a location spaced rearwardly from the rearward
surface (24b) of the first window (24), so as to not

interfere with the circulation of cooling fluid between the

windows (24,26).
A microwave window assembly (14) as in claimed in claim
1, wherein said second window (26) extends radially outward

beyond the exterior surface of said waveguide end
portion(34c) so as to define an annular outer window portion

(26c) extending outwardly of the waveguide (34) and annular
sealing means (28) co-act with said annular window portion

(26c) to seal the interior of the waveguide end portion (34c)
from the circulating cooling fluid.
A microwave window assembly (14) as claimed in claim 2,
wherein said annular sealing means (28) includes a seal plate

(28a).
A microwave window assembly (14) as claimed in claim 3,
further including a clamp plate (30) located within the space

(66) and configured to engage said seal plate (28a) so as to
retain said second window (26) therebetween, said clamp plate 

(30) having a window opening (30d) which defines said
waveguide surface (30d).
A microwave window assembly (14) as claimed in claim 3,
wherein said second window (26) and said seal plate (28a) co-act

to retain an elastomeric seal (44) therebetween such that
microwave energy passing through the waveguide end portion

(34c) is precluded from access to said seal (44).
A microwave window assembly (14) as claimed in any
preceding claim, further including a housing (19) which

retains said first (24) and second (26) windows and at least
a part of said waveguide end portion (34c), said housing (19)

including an outer sleeve (20) and an inner sleeve (22)
concentric therewith, and wherein said means for circulating

cooling fluid is also operative to circulate a cooling fluid
between said sleeves (20,22).
A microwave window assembly (14) as claimed in claim 6,
wherein said housing 19 further includes an annular flange

(52) which secures said waveguide end portion (34c) to said
inner (22) and outer (20) sleeves.
