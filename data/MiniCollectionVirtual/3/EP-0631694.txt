<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
connecting equipment. More particularly, the invention
relates to an apparatus by which computer-related equipment,
such as peripherals, may be attached to and detached from,
for example, other peripherals or a central processing unit
quickly and without the need for tools. Uniquely, the
invention facilitates the secure connection between such
equipment by the external manipulation of the housing of the
apparatus.Computer-related equipment, such as peripherals
and central processing units, are generally linked to each
other through signal cables. Attachment of the signal
cables to the computer equipment is accomplished through a
variety of devices, commonly termed interfaces. One type of
interface includes leads or pins to which one or more of the
many wires incorporated within the signal cable are
attached. The ends of the pins are sized and shaped so that
they may be snugly received in similarly sized and shaped
receptacle aligned in a socket that is generally fixed in
a wall of the computer equipment. The simple reception of
the pins within the receptacles, however, does not secure
the connection of the plug to the socket. The connection
can be easily disrupted, such as by bumping the plug or by
pulling on the cable.Many means are known to secure the connection
between the plug and the socket. One such securing means
includes male elements - such as threaded bolts - carried in
a housing in which the plug is fixed. The male elements are
appropriately sized and shaped to be received within female
elements - threaded in those embodiments in which the male
element is threaded - associated with the socket. With such
means, in order to secure the plug to-the socket, and,
thereby, the pins within the receptacles, the plug is 
positioned adjacent to the socket and such that male
elements in the plug can be received - such as by threading
- into the female elements in the socket.Many means are known by which the threading of the
male plug element into the female socket element is
accomplished. In some housings, the male elements have
heads opposite to the threaded ends. In these housings, the
male elements are carried such that the heads project
outward from a rear wall of the housing. The heads may have
a surface configuration such that a user must use a tool,
for example, a screwdriver or an allen wrench, to turn each
of the male elements separately. In other housings, male
elements are carried that have heads sized and shaped and
that project from the

<CLAIMS>
A connector (51) for securing a plug (41) to a
socket (31), said connector (51) comprising a housing

(52) for the plug (41), said housing (52) including a
plurality of male elements (91) rotatably carried such

that ends (92) of said male elements (91) project from a
wall (57) of said housing (52) for reception in openings

(36) associated with the socket (31), and synchronised
power transmission means;


said connector (51) being characterized in that
said synchronized power transmission means includes a

belt (62) and pulleys (81), said belt (62) being wrapped
around said pulleys (81) and engagingly contacting said

pulleys (81), each of said pulleys (81) matingly
contacting each of said male elements (91), at least a

portion of said belt (62) being exposed outside said
housing (52);
whereby manipulative force applied to said outer
surface (64) of said belt (62) is transmitted to said

each of said pulleys (81), and thereby to said each of
said male elements (91) to rotate said male elements

(91) in synchronized fashion so that said male elements
(91) are uniformly receivable in the openings (36)

associated with the socket (31).
An apparatus as defined in claim 1, further
characterized by said 
belt (62) being wrapped completely
around said housing (52).
An apparatus (51) as defined in claim 1 or 2,
further characterized by said each of said male elements

(91) of said apparatus (51) including a rearward end
(94) in addition to said ends (92), said rearward ends

(94) of said male elements (91) being mated to said
plurality of pulleys (81), whereby application of 

manipulative force to said outer surface (64) causes
said belt (62) and thereby said plurality of pulleys

(81) and said plurality of male elements (91) mated to
said pulleys (81) to rotate in synchronized fashion.
The apparatus (51) as defined in claim 1 or 2,
further characterized by the belt (62) having an inner

surface 971) including ribs (75) sized and shaped to be
received between teeth (82) of said pulleys (81).
The apparatus (51) as defined in any preceding
claim, further characterized by said ribs (75) being

sized and shaped to slip out of engagement with said
teeth (82) during torquing after full receipt of the

ends (92) of the male elements (91) in the socket
openings (36).
The apparatus (51) as defined in any preceding
claim, further characterized by said belt (62) being

comprised of a composite of materials.
The apparatus (51) as defined in any preceding
claim, further characterized by an outer surface (64) of

said belt (62) being textured.
The apparatus (51) as defined in any preceding
claim, further characterized by said pulleys (81)

including pulley openings (84) being sized and shaped to
matingly receive said rearward ends (94) of said male

elements (91).
The apparatus (51) as defined in claim 8, further
characterized by said pulleys (81) including springs

(88) contacting said rearward ends (94) of said male
elements (91) and by which said male elements (91) can

be partially retracted into said pulley openings (84). 
The apparatus (51) as defined in any preceding
claim, further characterized by said belt (62) being

comprised of layers of material.
The apparatus (51) as defined in claim 10, further
characterized by said layers of material including an

inner layer (79a) of high durometer material.
The apparatus (51) as defined in claim 11, further
characterized by said layers of material including an

outer layer (79b) of low durometer material.
