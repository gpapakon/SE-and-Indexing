<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to mirrors, and more particularly, 
to front and back surface mirrors that are resistant to mechanical and 
chemical attack. Most commercial mirrors are second surface mirrors comprising silvered 
glass composite structures wherein a thin layer of silver is deposited on 
the back or second surface of a glass substrate to reflect light. Silvered 
glass mirrors are generally desired because of their high visible 
reflectance and lack of colour. Because silver does not adhere well 
directly to glass, a relatively thin metal layer is applied to the glass 
surface prior to the application of the silver. To protect the silver from 
damage and degradation, especially from sulphur compounds such as SO₂ in 
the atmosphere, a protective coating is applied to its exposed surface. A 
common protective coating is a copper layer deposited over the silver 
followed by a thick paint spread over the copper layer. The lead in the 
paint apparently reacts with sulphur or sulphur compounds to form PbS. The 
copper layer interposed between the silver and paint layers enhances 
adhesion of the paint to the silver. Second surface silvered glass mirrors are susceptible to a phenomenon 
called "black edge." This degradative process occurs when silver on the 
cut edge of the mirror is exposed to moisture. This leads to chemical 
corrosion, which forms a "black edge" on the mirror that moves 
progressively inward. This degradative process is even more prevalent and 
pronounced when silver mirrors are used in high humidity environments 
containing sulphur compound contaminants. The above-described method of manufacturing second surface silver mirrors 
is also causing environmental concerns. Of primary concern is the lead and 
other chemicals in the waste products produced in the manufacturing 
process. For example, rinse water left over from the silvering process 
contains chemicals, silver, copper, and tin, and has been designated by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as hazardous waste. The paint used to back mirrors has to comply with certain industry 
requirements, but this also creates environmental problems. For example,  
 
as mentioned previously, a substratum coating of copper is first applied to 
the silver, making it necessary for the backing paint to possess adhesion 
and performance qualities in combination with the copper. Increasingly, 
many manufacturers are also demanding the paint be durable and to adhere 
well to the copper and silver underneath it. Thus far, the
