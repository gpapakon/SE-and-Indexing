<ABSTRACT>
A nylon cable tie (16) having a head (18) and a strap (20) terminating in a tip (22) is formed in a mold cavity defined by a first mold part (10) combined with a second mold part (12) by injecting molten nylon material into the mold cavity through an insulated runner system (40) and a gate that converges from the runner system toward the mold cavity and does not have a hot tip adjacent thereto. The mold parts (10, 12) are separated while retaining a portion of the head (18) in a head region (24) in the first mold part (10) and a portion of the tip (22) in a tip region in the second mold part (12), in order to separate the head (18) from the second mold part (12), to separate the tip (22) from the first mold part (10), and to separate a major portion of the strap (20) from the first and second mold parts. The mold parts (10, 12) are further separated while retaining said portion of the head (18) in the head region (24) to thereby remove said portion of the tip (22) from the second mold part (12). The head (18) is ejected from the head region (24) by protracted ejector pins (32) that penetrate the head region from within the first mold part (10). A component (34) containing a nozzle coupled to a source of compressed air and positioned closely adjacent the head region (24) is protracted from the first mold part (10) and pushes on the strap (20) to push the ejected head (18) of the cable tie (16) away from the ejector pins (32). The cable tie (16) is then ejected from between the mold parts (10, 12) by imparting against the ejected head (18) of the cable tie a forceful stream of compressed air directed from the nozzle in the component (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally pertains to injection molding of cable ties
and is particularly directed to methods and apparatus for reducing the cycle time
for injection molding of cable ties.A cable tie is an adjustable strap for bundling together articles such as
cables or the like. Cable ties are also known as cable straps, cable clamps, cable
clips, bundling ties, bundling straps, bundling clips, bundle ties, bundling belts,
wire ties, ring clamps, adjustable clamps, harnessing devices, strap seals, binding
straps, and ties. A typical cable tie includes an elongated strap with an adjacent
locking head at one end of the strap, a tip at the opposite end of the strap and
ratchet teeth on one side of the strap. The locking head defines an opening for allowing
the tip end of the strap to be pulled through the opening and thereby form
a closed loop around a bundle of articles. The locking head typically further includes
a pawl having teeth with surfaces for engaging the ratchet teeth to lock the
strap in the locking head after the tip end of the strap has been pulled through
said opening. Examples of cable ties are described in United States Patents Nos.
3,739,429, 3,924,299, 3,965,538, 4,473,524 and 4,573,242.Cable ties are manufactured economically by a cyclic injection molding
method, in which molten plastic material is injected into a mold cavity defining the
cable tie and then allowed to solidify within the mold cavity. The mold parts defining
the mold cavity are then separated and the cable tie is ejected, first from the
mold parts and then from the space between the mold parts. A preferred material
for cable ties is nylon. DE-A-1 485 656 describes removal of an elongated article
from a mold having a first mold part and a second mold part,
which when combined, define a mold cavity between the mold
parts for forming the article. The first mold part included
a region defining one end of the article and the second mold
part includes a region defining the other end of the
article. When the mold parts are separated, one end of the
article is retained in the first mold part in order to
separate a major portion of the article from the second mold
part.In accordance with one aspect of the invention a method
according to claim 1 is provided.In accordance with a further aspect of the invention an
apparatus is provided according to claim 8.Further embodiments are recited in the dependent claims.Additional features and advantages of the present invention are
described in relation to the description of the
