<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable gripping device (10) in the nature of an adjustable socket including a body (11) supporting a stem (14) having arcuate guide surfaces (16) along which gripping jaws (19) slide. The gripping jaws (19) include teeth (23) on their outer surfaces and a rotatable adjuster (24) is provided with an internal thread (27) for cooperation with the teeth (23) such that when the adjuster (24) is rotated in opposite direction, the jaws (19) move inwardly and outwardly.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to an adjustable gripping
device which in a particular aspect is in the form of
an adjustable socket.Socket sets are a common tool used for driving
bolts and nuts. Usually such sockets sets comprise a
plurality of sockets of different sizes to suit
different sized nuts or bolts. Use of such sockets is
often inconvenient where for example many different
size nuts or bolts are encountered as different sockets
are required to be individually detached from the
driving tool or wrench and the correct sized socket
reattached to suit the particular size nut or bolt to
be driven. Inconvenience also often arises if a
particular size socket is not readily available.Some adjustable sockets have been proposed in the
past to overcome the above problem, however, the known
adjustable sockets have a number of disadvantages. For example
such adjustable sockets are generally relatively
complex with some involving springs to bias the
gripping jaws.
The use of springs often causes
difficulties in manufacture and use. Other adjustable
sockets such as those disclosed in International Patent
Application No. PCT/US86/01319 (WIPO No. WO87/07864),
apart from being composed of a multitude of parts and
being relatively complicated in their operation, have
jaws with a limited range of opening so that their
application is limited. Additionally most adjustable
sockets have dimensions which make them unsuitable for
use in confined spaces.
An adjustable gripping device according to the preamble of claim
1 is known from, for example, US Patent No. 1,413,444.The present invention aims to overcome or at least
alleviate one or more of the above disadvantages by
providing an adjustable gripping device which may be in 
the form of an adjustable socket which is of simple construction such as to lend itself to easy
manufacture. The present invention further aims to provide an adjustable gripping
device which may be constructed so as to have relatively small overall dimensions whereby to
enable it to be used in confined spaces. The present invention further preferably aims to provide
an adjustable gripping device in which the range of jaw openings is relatively large so as to facilitate
gripping of members of a range of different sizes. Other objects and advantages of the invention
will become apparent from the following description.The present invention provides an adjustable gripping device which includes a body; an
adjuster means mounted to the body and rotatable relative thereto about a central axis of the body;
a

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable gripping device (10) which includes:

a body (11);
adjuster means (24) mounted to said body (11) and rotatable relative thereto about a central
axis (12) of said body (11);
a guide (14) co-operating with said adjuster means (24) and extending along said central axis
(12), said guide (14) having a plurality of arcuate guide surfaces (16); and
a plurality of jaws (19) spaced about said central axis (12) and supported for movement
relative to said body (11), said jaws (19) having arcuate surfaces (21) complementary to

respective said arcuate surfaces (16) on said guide (14), said jaws (19) being slidable along
respective said guide surfaces (16), each of said jaws (19) having a free end gripping portion

(22);
wherein said adjuster means (24) co-operates with said jaws (19) and is adapted when
rotated to move said jaws (19) radially inwardly or outwardly relative to said central axis

(12);

characterized in that
each of said jaws (19) has at least a portion located between respective said guide surfaces
(16) and said adjuster means (24), said adjuster means (24) surrounding said guide (14) and

having an internal thread (27) of a pitch circle which increases in diameter longitudinally
relative to said central axis (12), said thread engaging with one or more teeth (23) on said

jaws (19) such that rotation of said adjuster means (24) causes said jaws (19) to move along 
said arcuate guide surfaces (16) such that each of said gripping portion (22) moves radially

inwardly or outwardly relative to said central axis (12).
An adjustable gripping device (10) according to claim 1 wherein said arcuate surfaces (16)
of said guide (14) are separated by longitudinally extending ribs (17), each of said jaws (19)

having said at least a portion located between respective said ribs (17).
An adjustable gripping device (10) according to claim 2 wherein slots (28) are defined
between said guide (14) and said adjuster means (24) through which said jaws (19) extend.
An adjustable gripping device (10) according to claim 3 wherein said adjuster means (24)
comprises a hollow member having said thread (27) located internally at one end thereof.
An adjustable gripping device (10) according to claim 4 wherein said hollow member has
means at its end opposite to said thread (27) for engagement with said body (11) to allow

rotatable movement of said adjuster means (24) relative to said body (11) about said central
axis (12).
An adjustable gripping device (10) according to claim 1 wherein each said end gripping
portion (22) is inclined inwardly towards each other when said jaws (19) are in a closed

position.
An adjustable gripping device (10) according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein said body
(11) includes means for engagement with a driving tool.
An adjustable gripping device (10) according to claim 7 wherein said means for engagement
comprises a socket (13) in one end of said body (11).
