<ABSTRACT>
A purge control device for an evaporative 
control system comprises a single housing (20) having 

two solenoid actuated valves (32,34) controlling 
parallel orifices (40,70) leading from an inlet 

chamber (36) to an exit flow path (38). The two 
solenoid valves (32,34) have different sized orifices 

(40,70) to provide different flow capacities. Purge 
flow is controlled by an electronic control module 

(48) which regulates the duty cycle of the solenoids 
(32,34). Each valve (32,34) receives its own signal 

so that the flow through the orifices (40,70) is 
individually controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a purge control 
device suitable for use in a vehicle evaporative 
control system. Evaporative control systems are commonly 
employed on motor vehicles to reduce emissions of fuel 
vapour. Generally a storage canister containing 
activated charcoal adsorbs fuel vapour emitted from 
the fuel tank. To purge the canister, vacuum from the 
engine intake manifold draws air through the canister. 
The air carries the adsorbed fuel vapour into the 
intake manifold for combustion in the engine. To 
avoid purging an excess amount of vapour when the 
vacuum is high, for example, at idle or light engine 
load, a purge control device is situated in the vacuum 
line between the canister and the intake manifold. 
One type of purge control device is controlled by the 
engine control module through a pulse width modulated 
(PWM) signal. The effective flow area of the device 
is proportional to the duty cycle of the PWM signal. 
The duty cycle for a given frequency is the ratio of 
the on time of the signal to the period of the signal 
expressed as a percentage. For current applications 
this method of purge control is adequate. Future regulations may require a larger 
canister and, therefore, a more rapid canister purge. 
This would lead to a requirement for improved control 
of the purge flow, particularly during idle operation 
of the vehicle when the engine is least capable of 
consuming the fuel. An engine's ability to consume fuel vapour 
purged from a canister is largely governed by engine 
displacement. Therefore, prior art devices capable of 
controlling purge at idle in a large engine may not be  
 
capable of controlling purge at idle in a small 
engine. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved purge control device. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a purge control device as 
specified in claim 1. This invention can provide an improved 
device suitable for controlling purge of fuel vapour 
in a variety of vehicle evaporative control systems 
and may also provide adequate control of purge at idle 
in small engines as well as large engines, thereby 
avoiding the need for separate calibration of a purge 
control device for small and large engines. Two solenoid actuated valves are provided in 
a single housing to control parallel orifices in the 
purge flow path. The solenoid valves are preferably 
integrated into the housing with an electrical 
connector to connect the solenoids to an electronic 
control module. The solenoid valves are

adsorbing fuel vapour evaporated from a fuel tank and 
a purge line connecting the canister to an engine 

vacuum source, the purge control device comprising a 
housing (20) adapted to be connected in the purge line 

between a canister (12) and a vacuum source (26) and

flow from the canister, an exit flow path (38) for 
directing purge flow to the vacuum source, a first 

solenoid valve (32) for regulating purge flow from the 
inlet chamber to the exit flow path, a second solenoid 

valve (34) coupled in parallel relationship to the

from the chamber to the exit flow path, a first valve 
seat (54) surrounding the first orifice, and a first 

valve member (52) biased against the first valve seat 
to inhibit flow from the chamber to the exit flow path 

through the first orifice; the second solenoid valve 
including a second orifice (70) opening from the 

chamber to the exit flow path, a second valve seat

claim 1, wherein the first orifice is between 

approximately 5 and 6 mm in diameter to allow a high 
purge flow rate during preselected conditions, and the 

second orifice is between approximately 0.5 and 1.5 mm 
in diameter to allow a low purge flow rate during 

other preselected conditions.

claim 1 or 2, wherein the first and second valve 

members are iron discs (56,84) encapsulated in 
diaphragms (58,86).
