<ABSTRACT>
A method for continuously processing a silver halide color 
photographic photosensitive material by treating this material with a 

color developer containing at least one aromatic primary amine color 
developing agent, comprises the steps of covering the surface of a color 

developer replenisher in a color developer replenisher tank with a 
layer of a floating fluid and replenishing 20 to 100 ml of the color 

developer replenisher per m² of the photosensitive material to a color 
developing tank. This method makes it possible to inhibit the formation 

of the precipitate in the color developer replenisher caused when the 
amount of the replenisher is considerably reduced and also to inhibit 

the change of the photographic characteristics by change of the amount 
of the processed photosensitive material so that the amount of the color 

developer replenisher can be remarkably reduced to the range of 20 to 
100 ml per square meter of the photosensitive material and that of the 

waste water can be also remarkably reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for continuously 
processing a silver halide color photographic photosensitive material. 
In particular, the present invention relates to a continuous processing 
method wherein the color developer replenisher to be used is remarkably 
reduced in amount. In recent years, it is demanded to reduce the amount of a 
replenisher and also to reduce the amount of a waste water by 
regeneration of the waste water in order to prevent the environmental 
pollution. The reduction of the amount of a waste water, in particular, 
a color developer replenisher having a high BOD or COD is eargerly 
demanded. In order to reduce the amount of the color developer to be 
replenished, some problems must be solved. The replenisher acts to replenish components consumed in the 
development such as a developing agent and an alkali, thereby keeping 
the concentration of them in the color developer constant. In order to 
keep the concentration of the components in the color developer while 
reducing the amount of the replenisher, the concentration of the 
components in the replenisher must be increased as a matter of course.  
 One of problems caused in the reduction of the amount of the 
replenisher in the color development is that when the concentration of 
the color developing agent in the replenisher is increased, a 
precipitation is formed in a replenisher tank to cause troubles in the 
replenishing step and also to seriously vary the photographic 
characteristics. Various techniques of preventing the color developing agent from 
precipitation were proposed. For example, Japanese Patent Publication 
for Opposition Purpose (hereinafter referred to as "J.P. KOKOKU") No. 
Sho 47-20743 discloses a technique wherein polyvinyl alcohol or 
polyvinyl pyrrolidone (homopolymer or copolymer) is used. However, the 
effect thereof is yet insufficient for attaining the object of the 
present invention. Japanese Patent Application JP-A-5107715 reveals an automatic 
developing machine for silver halide photographic sensitive 
material. The purpose of the machine is to save on polution 
and manpower and to protect against spashing and moisture 
during processing. A floating cover is provided on a liquid 
level and solid processing agent is thrown in. Another object of the present invention is to solve a problem 
that when the replenisher is reduced in amount, the photographic 
characteristics are varied or, in particular, the sensitivity and the 
maximum density vary seriously depending on the
