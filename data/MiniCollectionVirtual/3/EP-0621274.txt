<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing a trimer of a low 
aliphatic
 aldehyde having 2-5 carbon atoms and the 
chlorinated 2-position is disclosed. The process 

comprises cyclically trimerizing said aliphatic aldehyde 
with chlorinated 2-position in the presence of a 

catalyst selected from the group consisting of metallic 
tin, metallic zinc, zeolite, and Lewis acids. It ensures 

easy separation of the catalyst from the target trimer 
and a high yield of the trimer. In addition, the 

unreacted raw material can be easily recovered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
manufacture of a trimer of an aliphatic aldehyde with 
chlorinated 2-position. Monochloroacetaldehyde (hereinafter abbreviated to MCA), 
2-chloropropionaldehyde (hereinafter abbreviated to 
CPA), 2-chlorobutyraldehyde (hereinafter abbreviated to 
CBA), and the like are known as aliphatic aldehydes with 
chlorinated 2-position (hereinafter called 2-chloroaldehydes). 
These 2-chloroaldehydes are useful 
compounds as raw materials for the synthesis of organic 
compounds such as drugs, agrichemicals, and the like. However, these 2-chloroaldehydes are unstable 
because of their possession of two functional groups; 
i.e., a high activity chlorine atom and an aldehyde group, 
in one molecule. Thus, it is difficult to store stably 
them for a long period of time. Technology for storing 
2-chloroaldehyde in a stable manner for a long period of 
time is therefore desired. In order to solve this problem, USP 5,008,370, for 
example, discloses that MCA can be stored as the trimer  
 
in a stable manner by the cyclic trimerization of MCA and 
that the trimer is easily regenerated into high purity 
MCA. The USP also discloses a process for manufacturing 
the MCA trimer. According to the process for manufacturing the MCA 
trimer disclosed by the USP 5,008,370, a chlorinated 
acetaldehyde solution containing MCA as a major component 
is dissolved into an organic solvent and reacted in the 
presence of concentrated sulfuric acid to produce MCA 
trimer. The same organic solvent and water are then 
added to the reaction mixture, in which part of the MCA 
trimer is present as crystals, in order to dissolve the 
crystals into the organic solvent and to separate a aqueous 
layer containing sulfuric acid. The organic layer is 
washed with water and the MCA trimer is recrystallized 
from the organic layer for separation. Regarding the manufacture of CPA trimer, EP 0484 742 
A1 discloses a method of trimerizing CPA by adding 
concentrated sulfuric acid to a mixture of a solution of 
chlorinated propionaldehyde and an organic solvent in the 
same manner as in the case of MCA. These processes for the manufacture of MCA trimer or 
CPA trimer, in which the trimerization of 2-chloroaldehyde 
is carried out in the presence of 
concentrated sulfuric acid, however, involves difficulty 
in separating the produced trimer from concentrated  
 
sulfuric acid. Washing of the organic layer containing 
the trimer is required for the removal of concentrated 
sulfuric acid. Since unreacted
