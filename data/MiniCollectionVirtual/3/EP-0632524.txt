<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric lens which is produced by injection 
molding of an expandable material consisting of a synthetic 

resin, a foaming agent and a dielectric constant conditioner. 
The expandable material is injected into a cavity of a foaming 

mold up to at least about 80 percent by weight and at 
least about 100 percent by volume of the capacity of the 

cavity and is foamed at an expansion ratio of not more than 
about 1.3. During the foam molding, the surface of the 

foam-molded body is solidified to be a radome layer. Then, 
the foam-molded body is transferred from the foaming mold to 

a shaping mold, in which the foam-molded is cooled down 
naturally. Further, a fitting tab is provided integrally 

with the foam-molded body at the edge of the radome layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
manufacturing process for
a dielectric lens used as an element of an antenna for receiving
microwave for communication and broadcasting.A conventional dielectric lens used as an element of
an antenna for receiving microwave of 5GHz or more is conventionally
made of a resin, for example, polypropylene, polyethylene,
polystyrene or the like. Ceramic powder, which
acts as a foaming agent and as a dielectric constant conditioner
is added, and the resin is foamed and molded into a
dome. Such a conventional dielectric lens is generally
produced by injection molding. However, in producing a thick
product by ordinary injection molding, there occur a sink
mark on the surface and a lot of voids inside.Therefore, injection compression molding and structural
foaming are recently suggested. Even a thick product
by the injection compression molding does not have defects 
such as a sink mark and a void, and additionally the product
can obtain a substantially fixed dielectric constant entirely.
However, the injection compression molding requires a
mold of a complicated structure and an exclusive molding
machine, and thus, the facilities are costly. The structural
foaming solves the problem about a sink mark and a void.
However, a product by the structural foaming varies in the
expansion ratio and in the dielectric constant from portion
to portion, and further, a swirl mark on the surface is
caused by bubbles.In the foaming and molding of the conventional dielectric
lens, the surface is solidified to be a radome
layer. The radome layer protects the inner foamy body from
weathering and reinforces the foamy body. However, if the
molded lens is taken out of the mold before the radome layer
is formed sufficiently thick, the radome layer will be deflected
by the expanding force of the foamy body. On the
other hand, if the mold is cooled too suddenly or if the mold
cooling time is too long, the radome layer will be formed too
thick, which lowers the characteristics as a lens. Further,
the long mold cooling time lengthens a molding cycle and
lowers the production efficiency.Further, in order to fabricate the dielectric lens as
an element of an antenna, the dielectric lens must be provided
with a fitting tab which is to engage with a bracket.
Conventionally, insert molding and sandwich molding are taken 
for providing the fitting tab. The insert molding is carried
out as follows: a fitting tab, which is made of a high
strength resin or a metal, is inserted into a mold; an expandable
material
