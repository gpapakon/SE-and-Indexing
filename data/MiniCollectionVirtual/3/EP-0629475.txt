<ABSTRACT>
The articulated arm for manipulators and industrial robots comprises an adjusting lever (2) which can be pivoted by motor about a fixed axle (1) and at the other end of which an intermediate lever (4) is pivotably articulated via a shaft (3) supported rotatably on the adjusting lever (2), the linearly movable lever arm (5) being seated at the other end of the intermediate lever (4) on a shaft (6), supported rotatably on the intermediate lever (4), and so as to be pivotable with said shaft, and tracking transmission means (7-13) dependent on the pivoting movement of the adjusting lever (2) acting at the shaft (3) connected so as to be fixed in terms of rotation to the intermediate lever (4) and at the shaft (6) connected so as to be fixed in terms of rotation to the lever arm (5). These measures ensure a very simple design of an articulated arm with an absolutely linear movement, brought about by the tracking transmission means, of the lever arm carrying the tool means, over a relatively long range.
