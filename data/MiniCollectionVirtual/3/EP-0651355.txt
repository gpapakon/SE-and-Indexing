<ABSTRACT>
A transaction card is described in which an
identifiable image can be stored in a limited amount of

storage space. The image to be stored is converted to
a pixel representation. The pixel representation is

divided into a plurality of ordered image portions.
Each image portion is compared with a set of reference

pixel groups. Associated with each pixel group is a
signal group. For each image portion, a signal group

is chosen for the associated pixel group most closely
associated with the pixel image portion. The signal

groups are stored as physical patterns on the storage
region of a transaction card. The physical patterns

are read and converted to electrical signals, the
signal groups can be identified. From the signal

groups, a reference pixel group is identified and the
reference pixel group is positioned with respect to the

image at the same location as the image portion. Using
this technique, a recognizable image can be constructed

from images information compatible with the ISO-7811/2
standards.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field 
of image compression and, more particularly to the 
apparatus and techniques for producing an image of 
sufficient quality to enable recognition of a person. 
The image is stored within the data capacity 
constraints of a conventional 210 bpi swipe-readable 
magnetic media such as those described by ISO 7811/2 
standards. Many types of transactions and access to 
services are authorized by the presentation of some 
form of identification/transaction/access card such as 
a credit card, debit card, voter registration card, or 
a health care access card. Many of these cards have 
incorporated thereon a stripe of magnetic material on 
which information has been written by the issuer of the 
card to aid in either access to services and/or 
identification of the card holder. Such cards are 
referred to, hereinafter, as transaction cards. Fraudulent use of transaction cards occurs 
when an individual presents an unauthorized card issued 
to another at a transaction point in order to gain 
access to services or resources. This problem is 
addressed by the present invention. Fraud in the credit industry can be used to 
illustrate the problem. One method of reducing fraud 
focuses on the confirmation of the identity of the 
person presenting a card at the transaction point as 
the individual to whom the card was authorized by the 
issuer. Images of card holders are useful in this  
 
identification process. Images of card holders are now 
printed on some of the poly-vinyl chloride (PVC)card 
stock of financial transaction cards such as the 
PhotoCard from the Citibank Corporation. This method 
takes a reflection print included with the credit 
application, captures the print with an electronic 
camera to convert a color digital format, and then 
"digitally imprints" the color image with a thermal 
dye-transfer process onto the PVC. Transaction cards without images printed 
thereon are counterfeited today. The addition of the 
digitally imprinted image of a card holder makes 
counterfeiting more difficult as card fabrication 
requires the writing of a false image onto the card. 
However, imprinting an image alone is not sufficient to 
prevent card forgery. The image imprinted on the card with dye is 
not directly available in digital form, although a 
similar digital file could be recovered by converting 
the analog dye densities back to a digital signal by 
rescanning. The two digital images are unlikely to 
match exactly, and the process involves color scanning 
hard

A method of encoding image information 
storage area on a transaction card, the method 

comprising the steps of: 
   representing said image by a multiplicity of 

pixels; 
   dividing said pixels into pixel groups, 

wherein said pixel groups are ordered according to a 
location in said image; 

   comparing said pixel groups with a plurality 
of reference pixel groups, each of said reference pixel 

groups having bit group associated therewith; 
   based on said comparing step, selecting a bit 

group; and

said storage area determined by an image location of 
said associated pixel group. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising

   associating each pixel location with a one of 
a plurality of sets of reference pixel groups, each 

reference pixel group of a set having a bit group

comparing said each pixel group with said set of 

reference pixel groups associated with said each pixel 
group location; and
