<ABSTRACT>
A contact type portable device (1A) comprises a power supply 
terminal (VDD,GND), a reset terminal (RST) and an input/output terminal 

(I/O) which are connected to an external device, an input/output 
circuit for receiving and delivering data from and to the 

exterior through the input/output terminal, a data processing 
circuit connected to the input/output circuit for processing 

data, a memory circuit (3,4) connected to the data processing 
circuit for storing data, and an internal reset signal 

generator (8A) for latching a predetermined potential when source 
power is applied from the external device through the power 

supply terminal, generating an internal reset signal by 
using the latched potential to bring the circuits into reset 

states, and stopping the generation of the internal reset 
signal to release the circuits from the reset states when a 

reset release signal is input from the external device 
through the reset terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to portable devices such 
as IC cards, and more particularly to a contact type portable 
device which is connected to the exterior through 
connection terminals, and a non-contact type portable device 
which has a battery built therein as a power supply. Generally, a contact type IC card has a microcomputer 
for IC cards which is mounted in the card, and transfers 
data to and from the exterior through connection terminals 
extended from the microcomputer to the card surface. In 
practice, the IC card is set in a reader/writer (not shown) 
and data is transferred to and from an external system under 
this condition. Fig. 16 is a functional block diagram of a conventional 
contact type IC card 1. The IC card 1 has five terminals, 
i.e., VDD, GND, RST, CLK and I/O terminals, for connection 
to the exterior. Transfer of data to and from the exterior 
is performed through the I/O terminal in series. Serial 
data input from the exterior through the I/O terminal is 
subject to serial/parallel conversion in a UART 6, and then  
 
taken into a CPU 2 through a bus 7. The CPU 2 processes the 
data in accordance with the processing program loaded in a 
masked ROM 3 beforehand, loads the data, which is required 
to be stored temporarily, in a RAM 4, and loads the data 
such as processing results, which is required to be stored 
for a long period of time, in an EEPROM 5 as a data memory. 
The data which is output to the exterior is subject to 
parallel/serial conversion in the UART 6, and then transferred 
to the exterior through the I/O terminal in series. The start-up operation of the IC card 1 will now be described. 
When the IC card 1 is set in the reader/writer, 
VDD and GND voltages are first supplied from the reader/writer 
to the IC card through the VDD and GND terminals, 
respectively. Then, a reset signal is input from the reader/writer 
to an internal reset signal generator 8 in the IC 
card 1 through the RST terminal. As shown in Fig. 17, the 
reset signal is inverted by an inverter 8a of the internal 
reset signal generator 8, latched by a latch 8b and then 
supplied as an internal reset signal RSTZ to the other 
circuits in the IC card 1. These circuits in the IC card 1 
are thereby brought into reset states. Under this condition, 
a clock signal is started to be supplied from the 
reader/writer through the CLK terminal. Then, after inverting 
the reset signal to release the reset states, usual data 
transfer and data processing are executed.  Next, a non-contact type IC
