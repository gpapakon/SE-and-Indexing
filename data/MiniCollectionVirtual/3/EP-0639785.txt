<ABSTRACT>
A spring hinge is described for spectacles, having a hinge part (1) which is guided, so as to be displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the bow (arm, side piece, side bow), in a housing (6) on the bow side and has a bolt (9) which projects away in the displacement direction, penetrates a helical spring (11) and has at the free end of the bolt a stop head (12) for the helical spring (11), and having a snap-lock-like (spring-lock-like) latching device between the hinge-side end of the helical spring (11) and the housing (6) which receives the helical spring (11) together with the bolt (9). The housing forms a latching receptacle (13) for a latching member, radially resilient relative to the bolt (9) or the helical spring (11), as a latching device, the latching member comprising at least one winding (11a) of the helical spring (11) with an outer diameter which is larger with respect to the other windings.
