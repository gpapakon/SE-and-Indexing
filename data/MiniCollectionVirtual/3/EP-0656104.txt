<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical device for rotation speed reduction, multiplication and variation consisting of a combination of two coaxial crown wheels of which one (6) is stationary or conditionally movable and rigidly connected to the reducer body (11), while the other (8) is movable and rigidly connected to the output shaft (1), which crown wheels enclose at least one pair of non-coaxial planet wheels (5, 7) rotated gyrationally by the input shaft (1), optionally via a sun wheel, said planet wheels being rotationally and gyrationally synchronised by means of a constant velocity transmission member (9), and following cycloid paths on the crown wheels. The device is particularly suitable wherever very high rotation speed step-down ratios are required, such as in 24-hour revolution systems for star tracking instruments, heads for tunnel driving machines, cable winding drums in lifting and handling systems, and slow drive systems, e.g. for harbour cranes, space launcher transport platforms, etc.

Mechanical device for reduction, 
multiplication and variation of rotation speeds 

comprising a fixed annular gear (6) and a moveable 
output annular gear (8), said annular gears being 

arranged coaxially and meshing respectively with at 
least one pair of planet gears (5) (7), said planet 

gears (5) (7) being non coaxial and mounted on a 
common planet carrier (2) characterised in that: 


the moduli or number of teeth of the two 
planet gears (5) (7) are not necessarily the same, 
the planet gears are synchronised in 
rotation by a homokinetic transmission gear (9), 
the planet gears are driven by input shaft 
(1) linked either to one planet gear (12) or the 

planet carrier (2). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the input planet gear (5) and 

output planet gear (7) are linked in rotation by a 
coupling (4) that allows their angular and/or radial 

adjustment at the time of assembly and maintenance, 
allowing adjustment down to the prestress of the 

backlash of said planet gears and their respective 
annular gears. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the pair or pairs of planet 

gears (5-7) are not in contact with the fixed and 
moveable annular gears (6, 8), the transmission 

between the fixed annular gear (6) and input planet 
gear (5), on the one hand, and between the moveable 

annular gear (8) and output planet gear (7), on the 
other hand, being ensured by intermediate toothed  

 
wheels or flexible elements such as toothed or non-toothed 

chains or belts. 
Device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the general shaft is hollow to 

allow unobstructed space for rod assemblies, control 
gear, cables or similar elements that pass through 

the central channel. 
Device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the input shaft (1) is on the 

same side as the output shaft (10) with one of them 
being hollow. 
Device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that either the input shaft (1) or 

output shaft (10) is fixed, the body (11) or housing 
of the apparatus constituting respectively the device 

that receives the input rotation or the device that 
delivers the output rotation. 
Device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that control of the rotation speed 

of the output shaft (10), including reversal of the 
direction of rotation, is obtained by controlling the 

fixed annular gear (6), which is rendered 
conditionally mobile in this case, without such 

variation or reversal requiring any variation or 
reversal of the direction of rotation of the input 

shaft. 
Device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that in large installations such as 

systems for rotating radio-frequency antennas or 
telescopes, it constitutes a structural member of the  

 
apparatus with which it cooperates, the orienting 

annular gear of said installations constituting the 
moveable annular gear (8) of the reduction gear and 

each pair of input planet gears (5) and output planet 
gears (7) being capable of themselves consisting of a 

reducing gear according to the device claimed, the 
output planet gear (7) being joined to the output 

shaft and the input planet gear (5) consisting of a 
toothed annular gear integral with the body of the 

apparatus and the drive motor being attached to a 
planet carrier arm that is aligned with the centre of 

rotation of the instrument. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that, in order to obtain the 

greatest possible speed reduction or multiplication 
value, the number of teeth CM of the moveable annular 

gear (8) is selected so that it equals the nearest 
integer to the ratio (CF x SS)/SE where CF is the 

number of teeth of fixed annular gear (6), SS is the 
number of teeth of output planet gear (7) and SE is 

the number of teeth of input planet gear (5), the 
output rotation being prograde if this integer 

exceeds said ratio and retrograde if it is less than 
this integer. 
Device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
9, characterised in that the tooth patterns are 

replaced by rollers or other friction-type elements. 
Device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
10, characterised in that some of the component parts 

are made of a ceramic or similar material making it 
capable of operating in harsh environments such as 

hot, abrasive, corrosive, space, nuclear, 
pressurised, cryogenic or seismic environments.
