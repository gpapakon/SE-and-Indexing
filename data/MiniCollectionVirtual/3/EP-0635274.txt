<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to sutures.Plasticizers are molecules that when mixed with polar
or hydrogen bonded polymers position themselves between
the intermolecular bonds, thus increasing the spacing
between adjacent bonds. In this manner, plasticizers
lower the strength of the intermolecular forces, thus
increasing the flexibility of the polymeric structure.
For example, PVC, which is polar, is plasticized by
substances such as dioctylphthlate. As another example,
nylon, which is hydrogen bonded, is plasticized by water.
Derivatives of long chain fatty aliphatic acids such as
lauric, palmitic, stearic or behenic acid have been
identified as spinning aids for polyamide fibers. (See,
U.S. Patent No. 3,516,956). Since the softening effect of
plasticizers is equivalent to increasing extrusion
temperatures, extruding plasticized polymers will require
lower temperatures for comparable melt viscosities. Thus,
the danger of thermal degradation of the polymer is
generally decreased by employing a plasticizer. In this
respect plasticizers are, indirectly, thermal stabilizes.Absorbable surgical devices have been made from
fibers of synthetic polymers such as polymer made from
glycolide, lactide or p-dioxanone. With respect to
polyglycolic acid sutures, U.S. Patent No. 3,297,033
states at column 3, line 45 that: "In general,
plasticizers tend to interfere with crystallinity,
orientation, etc., and weaken fibers, but are useful for
sponges and films." U.S. Patent No. 3,792,010 describes
plasticized polyester sutures prepared by reacting 
glycolide and lactide in the presence of a plasticizer
such as bis-2-methoxyethyl phthalate or acetoxytriethyl
citrate. U.S. Patent No. 3,636,956 states at column 7,
line 9 that any of a variety of plasticizers such as
glyceryl triacetate, ethyl benzoate and diethyl phthalate
can be used with polylactide and that preferred
plasticizers for glycolide/lactide copolymers are
dibutylphthalate and bis-2-methoxyethyl phthalate. U.S.
Patent No. 4,915, 893 describes spinning polyesters such
as polylactide with an additive such as a polyurethane,
glycolide, lactide, camphor, benzoic acid-2-hydroxyacetate,
hexamethylbenzene, 1,2-cyclohexandione and
other low molecular weight organic compounds which are
preferably soluble in trichlormethane and/or
dichlormethane and ethanol and having a melting
temperature in the range of 40° to 180°C.US-A-4983180 and US-A-4201216 are disclosures of sutures
coated with a lubricant composition which can be stearic
acid or calcium stearate.

particles; and
iii. mixing the particles and plasticizer
together to provide a substantially uniform distribution

of plasticizer among the particles.
A method as in claim 1 wherein said plasticizer
is selected from stearic acid and calcium stearate.
A method as in claim 1 or 2, wherein said
bioabsorbable polymer is selected from polymers made from

one or more of glycolide, glycolic acid, lactide, lactic
acid, epsilon-caprolactone and p-dioxanone.
