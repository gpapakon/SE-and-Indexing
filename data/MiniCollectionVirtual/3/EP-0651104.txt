<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a structural element of the type of those to be fitted together, to be superposed and to be bonded together by interposition of a binding layer in order to produce a wall. Each of the said parallelepipedal elements according to the invention has an upper face 1 and a lower face 2, the latter face of one of the elements being positioned on the first face of one or two other elements. The invention is characterised in that the face 1 has at least one binder receptacle consisting of a longitudinal plane channel 3 delimited by two longitudinal bosses and in that the lower face 2 has at least two longitudinal parallel ribs 5 whose spacing "overall" is less than that of the bosses 4 of the corresponding channel and whose height with respect to the plane wall of the lower face 2 is approximately equal to or less than or greater than the depth of the channel.

Building element of the type that mate
together, stack and bond by interposing a layer of a

binder in order to produce a wall, each of the said
elements of parallelipipedal shape having an upper face

(1) and a lower face (2), the latter of one of the
elements being positioned on the former of one or two

other elements during mating, the upper face (1) having
at least one longitudinal plane trough (3) delimited by

two longitudinal protuberances (4), characterized in
that the lower face (2) has at least one and preferably

several longitudinal parallel alignment ribs (5), of
which the "overall" separation is less than that of the

protuberances (4) of the corresponding trough and of
which the height with respect to the plane wall of the

lower face (2) is close to or greater than the depth of
the trough (3).
Building element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the upper face (1) has two

troughs (3) separated by a central protuberance and in
that the lower face (2) has two sets of two parallel

ribs (5) corresponding to the two troughs.
Building element according to Claim 1 and Claim
2, characterized in that the said elements have

longitudinal internal partitions (6) and in that the
said partitions are placed in the extension of the ribs

(5).
Building element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the troughs have two shoulders 

(8) for accomodating the ribs (5) and a U-shaped lower
mid-part which enables reinforcement bars (9) to be

housed.
