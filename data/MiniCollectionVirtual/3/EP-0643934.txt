<ABSTRACT>
Office furniture of the type composed of a pair of underframes joined together by a spacer piece in the form of a longitudinal horizontal beam (1) and of a board (3) resting on horizontal sections (6) transversely delimiting the upper portion of the said underframes,  characterised in that the said beam is fastened at each of its ends to one of the vertical elements of the corresponding underframe through the insertion of at least one elastic tab into a corresponding slot of the internal face of the said vertical element, and vertically pushing this tab in, with pinching of the upper edge of the said slot.

Item of office furniture consisting of a pair of 
underframes (2) connected by a spacing member in the form of a 

horizontal longitudinal beam (1) and of a top (3) resting on 
horizontal profiled sections (6) transversally delimiting the 

upper portion of the said underframes, of the type in which 
the said beam (1) is attached at each of its ends to one of 

the vertical members (5) of the corresponding underframe, 
characterised in that the means for this attachment are 

elastic lugs (12) created by recesses (11) formed in vertical 
plates (10) secured to the said beam and situated in vertical 

planes parallel to the plane of the said beam, each of these 
elastic lugs being inserted into a corresponding opening (14) 

formed in the internal vertical face (13) of the said vertical 
member of the said underframe also parallel to the plane of 

the said beam, and then pushed in vertically so as to exert a 
pinching action on the lower edge of the said opening. 
Item of furniture according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the said beam (1) is in the form of a profiled section 

having a vertical flange (7), an upper edge (8) folded over 
horizontally in one direction and a lower edge (9) in the form 

of a U-shaped channel extending in the opposite direction 
between the said vertical plates (10) with a view to the 

mounting of various accessories complementing the desk. 
Item of furniture according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that it has at least one storage compartment 

(20), a horizontal bracket (21) mounted on the rear vertical 
face of this compartment, being designed to hook onto the 

outer lip of the said U-shaped channel (9) with a view to 
attaching the said compartment to the said beam, then 

positioning it horizontally by tilting, then attaching it 
beneath the desk top, by means of a button and buttonhole 

system (24, 26), and finally immobilising it in position by a 
stud/housing pair (27, 28), the said stud (27) being  

 
elastically retractable in order to release the compartment 

with a view to its removal. 
Item of furniture according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the said top (3) rests on the one hand 

on the horizontal top edge (8) of the beam (1) and on the 
other hand on the said horizontal profiled sections (6) of the 

underframes (2), presenting, close to each corner of its 
bottom face, one of the components of a button/buttonhole pair 

(41, 40), the other component of which is formed in the top of 
the said corresponding horizontal profiled section (6), the 

positioning of the said top (3) being brought about through 
cooperation between the said components of each pair, and its 

subsequent immobilisation by means of screws (42) passing 
through the horizontal top edge of the said beam (1). 
Item of furniture according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the said U-shaped channel (9) of the 

beam (1) also receives in addition a fascia panel (30) fixed 
by screws (32) in the vertical flange (7) of the said beam (1) 

and in the rear face of which is fixed a horizontal profiled 
section with a Z-shaped cross section (31) fitting into the 

channel (9) of the said beam (1) so as to immobilise the said 
panel (30). 
Item of furniture according to any one of Claims 1 - 5, 
characterised in that the button/buttonhole pair (41, 40) 

consists, on the one hand, of a screw with a large round head 
(41), and on the other hand of an opening (40) of the gusset 

type, the large diameter of which is slightly greater than 
that of the said head, and the small diameter of which is the 

same as that of the shank of the said screw.
