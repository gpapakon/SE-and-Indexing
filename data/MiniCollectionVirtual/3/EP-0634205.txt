<CLAIMS>
The use of a catalyst which is un-heated and consists of a carrier in the form
of a net which is coated with a precious metal and in front of which and at a

distance therefrom there is provided a further net which is not coated with precious
metal for the catalyst.
The use of a catalyst as claimed in claim 1 characterized in that the carrier in
the form of a net is a fine-meshed expanded metal.
The use of a catalyst as claimed in claim 1 characterized in that the carrier in
the form of a net is a net made of plastic.
The use of a catalyst as claimed in claim 1 or 2 characterized that the carrier
in the form of a net consists of a steel which contains aluminium and is oxidized

at its surface.
The use of a catalyst as claimed in claim 3 characterized in that the carrier in
the form of a net is coated with precious metal by chemical deposition from

aqueous solutions, by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), by physical vapor
deposition (PVD) or by sputtering.
The use of a catalyst as claimed in any of the preceding claims characterized
in that the distance between the carrier in the form of a net and the further net

is between 1 mm and 3 mm, preferably between 1 mm and 2 mm. 
The use of a catalyst as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized
in that two nets which are coated with precious metal are provided in mutual

superimposition and another net which is not coated with precious metal is
provided in front of the arrangement of said two nets.
