<ABSTRACT>
A machine (1) serves to cut a paper web or a similar material (2) into sheets (34) with simultaneous cutting of a transverse strip (35). The machine comprises a stationary bottom knife (9) and an overlying, rotatable, solid knife cylinder (15) having a chord face (20) on which an inner knife (16) and an outer knife (17) are fixed for cutting a sheet (34) and a strip (35), respectively, from the paper web (2) when the knives (16, 17) pass close above the bottom knife (9) during rotation, while the paper web is advanced at a suitable rate between the knives by two vacuum rollers (3, 4). The knife cylinder (15) and the knife setup (16, 17) offer great resistance to bending. The machine lends itself for cutting paper webs in inch modules into e.g. A4 sheets which can be used in modern laser printers which are designed for the millimeter system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a machine for cutting a paper web 
or a similar material into sheets with simultaneous cutting 
of a transverse strip for each sheet 
according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a machine is known 
from EP-A-0468254. The electronic data processing technology has its origin 
in the USA where the inch system is used for measuring 
lengths. From the outset electronic data processing machinery 
as well as EDP related external printing machines 
have therefore been designed for advancing and printing 
endless lists with modules in inches. In countries using 
the metric system this has caused problems of e.g. filing, 
and the inch modules do not fit the new generations of 
modern laser printers which can only work with formats 
based on the metric system. In countries using the metric 
system paper webs divided into inch modules must therefore 
be cut into sheets to a great extent, which are standardized 
within the metric system, a narrow strip being cut 
for each sheet. Paper webs which e.g. have a module of 12 
inches are thus cut down to 297 mm, i.e. A4 format, with 
simultaneous cutting of a strip of about 7.8 mm from each 
sheet.  
 The patent publication WO 82/00970 describes an apparatus 
capable of performing such an operation. This construction 
has a stationary bottom knife and an overlying knife cylinder 
having two knives arranged on their respective 
sides of a relatively wide slot, which is cut along the 
knife cylinder and extends into a bore which is provided 
centrally in the cylinder and extends out to one of the 
ends of the cylinder where it communicates with a source 
of vacuum. This arrangement serves to remove the strips as 
soon as they have been cut from the paper web, the strips 
being immediately sucked up into the central bore of the 
knife cylinder via the space between the knives and the 
longitudinal slot, following which the strips continue 
axially out through the bore to a collection point. Cutting 
does not take place as a cutting operation proper, 
but is more in the nature of a linear compression of the 
paper of a magnitude such that the fibres of the paper are 
crushed and torn across. This process requires very big 
forces which the knife cylinder must be capable of absorbing. 
However, the knife cylinder is greatly weakened by 
the longitudinal slot and the central bore and therefore 
tends to bend at the center during cutting, which will 
thus tend to be deficient so that some of the strips are 
not cut cleanly, but are still partly connected to

<CLAIMS>
A machine (1) for cutting a paper web (2) or a similar 
material into sheets (34) with simultaneous cutting of a 

transverse strip (35) for each sheet (34), comprising a 
stationary bottom knife (9) arranged transversely to the paper 

web (2) and a rotatable knife cylinder (15) arranged over said 
bottom knife (9) and likewise transversely to the paper web 

(2) and having at least one set of mutually associated knife 
cutting edges (31;32) which, by close passage of the bottom 

knife cylinder (9), successively cut a sheet (34) and a strip 

(35), respectively, from the paper web (2), while said paper 
web (2) is advanced continuously between the bottom knife (9) 

and the knife cylinder (15), whereby the knife cylinder (15) 
is substantially solid and the knife cutting edges (31;32) of 

an associated set are provided on a cross-sectionally 
substantially rectangular knife device (16,17) composed of two knives 

(16,17)

(16,17) has one of its faces fixed against a chord face (20) provided 

on the knife cylinder (15) and in that it 
is composed of an inner knife (16) fixed 

against the chord face (20) of the knife cylinder (15) and an 
outer knife (17) fixed against the outer side of the inner 

knife (16), said outer knife (17) carrying the cutting edge
