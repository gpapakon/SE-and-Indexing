Injector or mixer for feeding a mixture of air and fibre suspension into a flotation
tank, whereby one or more parallel flow channels are provided, which have an

input end (E) and output end (A) and a cross section that changes in flow
direction with repeated constrictions and widenings, and in which with respect

to the flow direction through the flow channel upstream means for feeding
suspensions (23) and means for feeding air (21, 22) into the flow channel are

provided, whereby each flow channel has two opposite plates (3, 4, 3', 4') or
concentrically arranged cylinders (26, 27) the facing walls of which are

provided alternatively with longitudinal elevations (8, 9; 8', 9') and depressions
extending perpendicular to the flow direction along the walls, and the elevation

longitudinal axes and correspondingly the depression longitudinal axes with the
longitudinal axis of the flow channel form angles (b) of between 10° and 90°,

and whereby the cross section (p
j
) of the elevations (8, 9; 8', 9') of the plates (3,
4; 3', 4') or cylinders (26, 27) is in a ration to the corresponding cross section

(q
k
) of the intermediate spaces between the elevations - taken in flow direction
-of at least 0.5 : 1.
Injector according to claim 1, characterised in that the ratio of the distance f
between the planes contacting the apexes of the elevations to the height a of

the elevations is in the following range: 
0.1 ≤ f/a ≤ 10
.
Injector according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that adjacent elevations (8,
9; 8', 9') or depressions of the plates (3, 4; 3', 4') or cylinders (26, 27) run

parallel to one another or with a deviation in angle (b) of at most 8° from
elevation to elevation.
Injector according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the elevations of
the plates or cylinders cross one another.
Injector according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the angle (b)
which the elevations form with the general flow direction of the suspension in

the respective channel increases continually from elevation to elevation or
relative to groups of consecutive elevations in the said flow direction in a range

of between 20° and 90°. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the distance
between the two planes contacting the adjacent elevations (8, 9'; 8', 9') of

opposite plates (3, 4; 3', 4') is more than 5 mm, preferably 8 mm.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the distance
between the two planes f contacting the adjacent elevations (8, 9; 8', 9') of

opposite plates (3, 4; 3', 4') is variable and greater from the input end (E) to
the output end (A).
