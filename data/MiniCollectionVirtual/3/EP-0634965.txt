<ABSTRACT>
A socket for turning threaded connectors by a power tool comprises a socket body (1), connecting formations (3) for connecting a socket body (1) to a power tool, engaging formations (4) provided in the socket body (1) for engaging with a threaded connector and strain measuring formations (5) arranged in the socket body (1) so that when the socket body (1) engages a threaded connector and a tool is connected with the socket body (1) and turns the socket body (1) and therefore the threaded connector, the strain measuring formations (5) measure a turning resistance of the socket relative to a power applied by the power tool for turning the threaded connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sockets which are used
in conjunction with a power tool, such as for example, a
wrench, for turning a threaded connector, such as for
example, a nut.The problem for a consumer who uses power tools for
turning threaded connectors, is that the consumer would
like to know what exact torque is being applied to each nut
and, if possible, he would like to obtain a computer
reading for each individual nut. In the past the applicant
provided a torque chart which was based on the pressure
applied to the power tool. This torque chart was
established by the applicant on a calibration stand where
he tested the tool prior to shipment, for pressure versus
torque output. The problem with this approach is that when
something goes wrong with the tool and the pressure can
build up, the operator might think that he has obtained the
desired torque. In reality he only obtained the pressure
in the system. In addition, the customer likes to
calibrate the tools used during assembly prior to the
assembly, which requires the purchase of a calibration
stand.Another known approach is disclosed in DE-A-3150383 which describes a device for
transfering torque, applied by means of a power tool, indirectly via a socket boby to a threaded connector. A strain measuring means positioned axially outwardly of the socket body measures the torque applied by the power tool.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention
to provide a device and in particular a socket which
eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.In keeping with this object and with others which
will become apparent hereinafter, there is provided a socket
as claimed in the ensuing claim 1. When the socket is designed in accordance with the
present invention, the measurement of the turning
resistance of the nut relative to the turning force of the
drive portion of the power tool is performed, and the
torque reading equals exactly the torque applied. Since
the strain measuring means such as strain gauges in the
socket is connected to a read-out device, it is possible to
print out the results. Thereby, the studs to be tightened
can be numbered and added later to the record of the job.Furthermore, if a customer just requires a tool
calibration prior to the job, it can be done by simply
applying the socket to the tool and measuring the pressure
versus torque output on a tight nut.In accordance with an especially advantageous feature
of the present invention, the socket has a housing and an
adaptor which is inserted in the housing and is

<CLAIMS>
A socket for turning a threaded connector by means of
a power tool, comprising a socket body (1) having an axis

(2), connecting means (3) at one axial end of the socket
body (1) for connecting the latter to a power tool, engaging

means (4) in said socket body (1) at the opposite axial end
thereof for engaging with a threaded connector, and strain

measuring means (5), whereby in use torque, applied by a
power tool, is transferred via the socket body (1) to a

threaded connector engaged by the engaging means (4),
characterised in that the socket body (1) is constructed so

as to transfer torque applied by a power tool connected to
the connecting means (3) directly to a threaded connector

engaged by the engaging means (4), and in that the strain
measuring means (5) is arranged in said socket body (1)

between the connecting means (3) and the engaging means (4)
in a position such that in use, when a power tool is

connected to the connecting means (3), the engaging means
(4) engages a threaded connector and the power tool turns

the socket body (1) and therefore the threaded connector,
the strain measuring means (5) measures the strain in the

socket body, and thus provides a measure of the torque
applied by the power tool to the socket body and therefore

to the threaded connector.
A socket according to claim 1, characterised in that
said socket body (1) has a housing (7) and an adaptor (8)

arranged therein, said strain measuring means (5) being
located in said adaptor (8).
A socket according to claim 2, characterised in that
said connecting means (3) is provided in said adaptor (8)

and in that said engaging means (4) is provided in said
housing (7).
A socket according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in
that said adaptor (8) and said housing (7) are hollow bodies

of revolution and in that the adaptor (8) is coaxially
arranged inside the housing (7).
A socket according to any one of claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that the socket further comprises 

connection means for connecting the adaptor (8) to the
housing (7).
A socket according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that said strain measuring means

(5) comprises a mechano-electrical operating means and in
that the socket further comprises electrical conductor means

(6) extending from said strain measuring means (5) outwardly
of the socket body (1).
A socket according to claim 6, characterised in that
the socket further comprises guiding means (11) for guiding

said electrical conductor means (6), said guiding means
including a guiding member (11) through which said

electrical conductor means (6) extend and which is freely
movable relative to said socket body (1) so that during

turning of said socket body the electrical conductor means
do not tangle.
A socket according to claim 7, characterised in that
said guiding member (11) is formed as a substantially ring-shaped

member and in that said socket body (1) has a
substantially cylindrical portion on which the substantially

ring-shaped member is freely turnable.
