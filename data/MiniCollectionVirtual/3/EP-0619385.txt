<ABSTRACT>
Process and device for controlling the boron content of borophosphosilicate, BPSG. The BPSG is obtained by oxidation of silane, diborane and phosphine in a reactor, starting with a first diborane/silane mixture, a second phosphine/silane mixture and a silane stream, by controlling the ratio  rho  = diborane/(diborane + silane) of the resulting mixture. The control is obtained by measuring (100) the residual hydrogen content  chi  in the first mixture and then modulation (101) of the mass flow rate of the first mixture as a function of the value of the residual hydrogen content, and this makes it possible to regulate the boron content of the borophosphosilicate obtained. Application to the manufacture of integrated circuits.
