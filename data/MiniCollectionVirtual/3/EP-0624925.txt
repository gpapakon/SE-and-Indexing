<ABSTRACT>
A connector includes first terminals that are 
mounted on a vehicle-side housing in a projected manner, 

and second terminals that are mounted on a power source-side 
housing. A first contact portion provided at one end 

of each of the second terminals is so disposed as to be 
contacted with a respective one of the first terminals, 

and a first opening/closing switch of a detection circuit 
is constituted therebetween. A second contact portion 

provided at the other end of the second terminal is 
disposed in facing relation to a contact plate affixed to 

a lower surface of a lock lever, and a second 
opening/closing switch is constituted therebetween. In a 

half-fitted condition, the first opening/closing switches 
are closed, but the second opening/closing switches are 

open, and therefore, the detection circuit has not yet 
been closed. When the complete fitting is achieved, a 

retaining pawl of the lock lever fits in a fitting hole, 
so that the contact plate is brought into contact with the 

second contact portions of the second terminals, thereby 
closing the second opening/closing switches, so that the 

detection circuit is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector, and more 
particularly to a connector having an electrical fitting 
detection function such that an electrical connection 
providing, for example, electrical charging, can be 
effected when female and male connector housings are 
completely fitted together. There is known a connector of this type having a 
fitting detection function, wherein when female and male 
connector housings are fitted together, a retaining pawl 
is fitted in a fitting hole in a fitting hole-forming 
plate to lock the housings relative to each other, and the 
retaining pawl and the fitting hole-forming plate are both 
made of metal and are connected, as terminals of a detection 
circuit, directly to a charging path. In the above construction, however, when the 
connector is in a half-fitted condition, in which the 
retaining pawl is not received in the fitting hole but is 
merely contacted with the fitting hole-forming plate, the 
detection circuit is closed. If charging is effected in 
this condition, the retaining pawl jumps off the fitting 
hole-forming plate during the time when the connector 
shifts into a completely-fitted condition, so that the two 
terminals are disengaged from each other, and a fine spark 
is produced between the two terminals, which results in a 
possibility that the terminals are deteriorated by oxidation 
or the like. In another known detection system disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 3-190068, a pin 
terminal for detection purposes and a reception terminal 
having a contact portion of a small area for receiving the 
pin terminal, are provided on side surfaces of two housings. 
When the housings are completely fitted together, 
the pin terminal is contacted with the contact portion of 
the reception terminal, thereby closing a detection 
circuit. In this construction, a stroke control must be 
precisely effected. In other words, the mounting position  
 
of the pin terminal and the reception terminal must be 
precisely accurate. Thus, this construction has a drawback 
in that the manufacturing cost is high. From EP-A-0 448 084 a connector comprising a male connector 
housing having a first lock member, a female connector 
housing having a second lock member engaging said first 
lock member when said connector housings are in a 
completely fitted position, at least one first lock 
detection terminal disposed in said male connector housing, 
and a corresponding at least one second lock detection 
terminal disposed in said female connector
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising: 

a male connector housing (1) having a first lock member 
(17); 
a female connector housing (2) having a second lock 
member (10) engaging said first lock member (17) when said 

connector housings (1, 2) are in a completely fitted position; 
at least one first lock detection terminal (20) disposed 
in said male connector housing (1); and 
a corresponding at least one second lock detection 
terminal (23) disposed in said female connector housing 

(2), said corresponding at least one second lock detection 
terminal (23) being electrically engageable with said at 

least one first lock detection terminal (20); 
 
   characterized by further comprising
 
   a contact plate (27) attached to one of said first 

lock member (17) and said second lock member (10) and electrically 
engageable with a respective one of said at least 

one first lock detection terminal (20) and said corresponding 
at least one second lock detection terminal (23), said 

at least one first lock detection terminal (20), said corresponding 
at least one second lock detection terminal (23) 

and said contact plate (27) defining a detection circuit 
(32), wherein said detection circuit is closed only when 

said connector housings (1, 2) are in said completely fitted 
position. 
The connector according to claim 1, comprising two 
first lock detection terminals (20) in said male connector 

housing (1) and two second lock detection terminals (23) in 
said female connector housing (2).
