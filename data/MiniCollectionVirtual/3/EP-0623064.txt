<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method is provided for controlling the temperature of dies (12) and workpiece (14) throughout a deformation process. Dies (12) are capable of receiving external current to resistively heat the workpiece (14) and dies (12) during the deformation operation, the external current being modulated by feedback temperature readings taken from the workpiece (14). External current may be provided from a homopolar generator (18) capable of producing pulsed dc current at controllable intervals and magnitudes simultaneously through the dies (12) and workpiece (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for
deforming a workpiece. In particular, the apparatus and
method of the present invention is suitable for
regulating the temperature of one or more dies and a
workpiece placed between the dies before, during and
after deformation of the workpiece.In the manufacture of various workpieces, it is
necessary to shape those workpieces by such methods as
casting, machining, consolidating smaller pieces (i.e.,
welding) and deformation. Metal deformation is a process
which exploits a remarkable property of metals -- their
ability to flow plastically in a solid state without
concurrent deterioration of properties. Thus, a
workpiece may be reshaped or deformed without losing its
inherent strength, etc.Deformation processes usually involve heating the
workpiece prior and/or during a shaping or compression
operation. However, cold-deformation can also be used.
If the workpiece is heated above its recrystallization
temperature, the workpiece deformation process is
generally referred to as "hot working" the workpiece.
Hot working is advantageous in that grain distortion is
minimized during the deformation operation. There are numerous hot working processes, several of
which are rolling, forging, extrusion, pinch and roll,
etc.Rolling is usually the first step in converting a
workpiece into sheets, plates, bars and strips of
finished product. Basic rolling consists of passing a
heated workpiece between two rolls that revolve in
opposite directions. The space between the rolls is
somewhat less than the thickness of the entering
workpiece. Thus, the metal is squeezed and elongated,
and usually changed in cross section. It is very
important that the entering workpiece be heated uniformly
throughout its cross-section. This usually requires
prolonged heating at the desired temperature, a process
known as soaking. Gas- or oil-fired soaking pits are
often used to preheat the workpiece prior to its
entering between the two rolls.Forging is a thermomechanical process for shaping a
solid workpiece by the application of force, either
impact or continuous, to create a different geometry from
that of the original workpiece or billet geometry. As
used herein, forging includes open-die forging, closed
die forging, swaging, heading, etc. Similar to rolling,
the workpiece to be forged is usually heated to an
elevated temperature at which the workpiece is malleable
and/or ductile. The workpiece may be heated prior to
forging, either in a fuel-fired furnace, indirect
electric furnace,
