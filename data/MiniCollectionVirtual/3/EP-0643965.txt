<ABSTRACT>
An orally administered antihyperlipidemia composition according to the present 
invention includes from about 250 to about 3000 parts by weight of nicotinic acid, and 

from about 5 to about 50 parts by weight of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Also, a 
method of treating hyperlipidemia in a hyperlipidemic having a substantially periodic 

physiological loss of consciousness, includes the steps of forming a composition having 
an effective antihyperlipidemic amount of nicotinic acid and a time release sustaining 

amount of a swelling agent. The method also includes the step of orally administering 
the composition to the hyperlipidemic substantially immediately prior to each periodic 

physiological loss of consciousness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to compositions of nicotinic acid useful for 
treating hyperlipidemia and methods of treating hyperlipidemia employing such 
compositions. More particularly, the present invention employs a composition of 
nicotinic acid, derivatives and mixtures thereof, and a swelling agent to form a time 
release sustaining composition for nocturnal or evening dosing. Specifically, the 
present invention employs a composition of nicotinic acid and hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose to treat hyperlipidemia in a once per day oral dosage form given 
during the evening hours. Nicotinic acid has been used for many years in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. 
This compound has long been known to exhibit the beneficial effects of reducing total 
cholesterol, low density lipoproteins or "LDL cholesterol", triglycerides and lipoprotein 
a (Lp(a)) in the human body, while increasing desirable high density lipoproteins or 
"HDL cholesterol". Because of certain side effects however, nicotinic acid has normally been 
administered three times per day after meals. This dosing regimen is known to provide 
a very beneficial effect on blood lipids as discussed in Knopp et al; "Contrasting 
Effects of Unmodified and Time-Release Forms of Niacin on Lipoproteins in 
Hyperlipidemic Subjects: Clues to Mechanism of Action of Niacin"; Metabolism 34/7, 
1985, page 647. The chief advantage of this profile is the ability of nicotinic acid to 
decrease total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and Lp (a) while increasing 
HDL particles. While such a regimen does produce beneficial effects, cutaneous 
flushing and the like still often occurs in the hyperlipidemics to whom the compound is 
administered. In order to avoid or reduce the undesirable side effects, a number of materials 
have been suggested for administration with an effective antihyperlipidemic amount of 
nicotinic acid, including guar gum in U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,252, and mineral salts as 
disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,245; or inorganic magnesium salts as reported in U.S.  
 
Pat. No. 4,911,917. These materials have been shown to reduce various of the side 
effects commonly associated with nicotinic acid treatment. Another method of avoiding or reducing the side effects associated with 
immediate release niacin is the use of sustained release formulations. Sustained release 
formulations are designed to slowly release the compound from the tablet or capsule. 
The slow drug release reduces and prolongs blood levels of drug and thus minimizes 
the

1. An antihyperlipidemic composition of the oral type employing an effective 
antihyperlipidemic amount of nicotinic acid or compound metabolized to 

nicotinic acid by the body, given once per day in the evening or at night to 
produce a significant reduction in total and LDL cholesterol as well as a 

significant reduction in triglycerides and Lp(a), with a significant increase in 
HDL cholesterol. 
2. A composition, as set forth in Claim 1, comprising from about 250 parts to 
about 3000 parts by weight of nicotinic acid.

to form nicotinic acid. 
11. A composition, as set forth in Claim 9, wherein the compound substituted for 
nicotinic acid is nicotinyl alcohol tartrate.
