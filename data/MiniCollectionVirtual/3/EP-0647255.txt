<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of a melanin pigment with a very small grain size, 100 % of the particles thereof having a grain size of less than 1  mu m. The process consists in solubilizing a natural or synthetic melanin in an aqueous medium containing at least one alkalinizing agent and/or at least one sequestering agent and in precipitating the melanin so solubilized by adding at least one alkaline-earth metal salt. The invention also concerns the use of said pigment in cosmetic treatment compositions and in hair dyeing.
