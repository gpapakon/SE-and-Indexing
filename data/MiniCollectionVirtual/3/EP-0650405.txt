<ABSTRACT>
An extendible-retractable device, which is made up of a number of interconnected members (10, 12, 14) and to which a suitable tool (44) may be attached. The device makes it possible to continually change the position of the tool (44) as a task is being performed. The device includes members (10, 12, 14) which are attached to each other through flexible cables (16, 22, 30, 32) so that relatively small movements of a handle (20) or similar device in the hand of the user results is relatively large extension or retraction movements of the farthest member (14) which carries the tool (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable extendible-retractable device. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a device which is useful for
efficiently extending and retracting a wide variety of tools and, more
particularly, to a device made up of plurality of interacting members which
can be easily extended and retracted so as to place in the desired location
a tool or other instrumentality attached to the device.It is often desirable to be able to place and cause to operate a tool
or other instrumentality (hereinafter "tool") at a location which is more
distant than can be comfortably be reached by extending one's arm with
the tool therein. For example, when one wishes to change an incandescent
light bulb located in a ceiling which is 3 meters (ten feet) tall, it is necessary to grab
and rotate the light bulb. To this end one might climb on a ladder and use
one's hand to replace the bulb. Alternatively, one could obviate the need
to use a ladder by using a sufficiently long pole which had a tool at its end
which was capable of grabbing and rotating the bulb. In this case, the
operator would remain standing safely on the ground while replacing the
light bulb and would carry out the operation through the use of the long
pole.While a pole as described is useful in certain application, it is not
free from shortcomings. Primarily, it is known that, unlike the case of
replacing a light bulb described above, in many operations the location at
which the operation is to take place is not at a fixed distance from the user
but varies either discretely or continually during the operation.For example, if one wished to paint the 3 meter (ten-foot) tall walls and the
ceiling of a room with paint roller, means must be at hand for locating the
roller at every point on the walls and ceiling. Furthermore, the location of
the roller varies instantaneously during each painting stoke, regardless of
the position of the painter. One option is to use a hand-held roller and
make use of a ladder of scaffolding to reach the top portions of the walls 
and the ceiling. Another alternative is to mount the roller on a sufficiently
long pole which will allow the top portions of the walls and the ceiling to
be reached with the painter remaining standing on the floor without
requiring the use of a ladder.One disadvantage of this technique is that the length of a stroke is
limited by the distance though which the painter's arms can move, i.e., if
the painter is able to translate
the pole a distance of 0.9 meter (three
