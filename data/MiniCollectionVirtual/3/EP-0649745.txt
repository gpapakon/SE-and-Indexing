<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet print head (10) has a supply channel (14, 
24, 52) connecting an ink source with an upper manifold 

(60U) and a lower manifold (60L). Each manifold has a 
tapered structure. From each manifold multiple inlet 

channels (36, 34, 44, 54) each lead to a respective 
pressure chamber (28) from which an outlet channel (40, 

38, 46, 56, 62, 76, 82) leads to nozzles (88) from which 
droplets of liquid ink are expelled as a result of the 

action of a pressure transducer on the pressure chamber. 
Each manifold is separated from the supply channel by a 

baffle structure (92) that includes three baffles (94) 
formed by alternating plates (64, 78) having an open 

manifold with plates (58, 72) having a blocked manifold. 
The baffle structure reduces jetting nonuniformity by 

damping pressure displacement waves in the ink caused by 
the expulsion of ink droplets. The baffle structure also 

promotes effective heat transfer from the print head to 
ink being drawn in to the print head from the ink source. 

The print head is operated by drawing ink from the supply 
channel through the baffle structure to replace ink drawn 

from the manifold as a result of expulsion of ink from the 
nozzles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to multiple-orifice
drop-on-demand ink jet printers and, in
particular, to ink jet print heads for such printers.Ink jet printers place an image on a surface of
a substrate (such as a piece of paper) by ejecting
droplets of liquid ink in a controlled pattern from one or
more arrays of multiple nozzles. Ink jet printers include
an ink source (such as a reservoir) fluidically connected
to a print head; the print head typically shuttles back
and forth across the surface of the substrate, and that
surface is periodically advanced to allow the print head
to print on an area of that surface. The print head
contains an ink pathway for conveying liquid ink to the
nozzles and drive mechanisms, such as pressure chambers
bounded by a thin diaphragm coupled to pressure
transducers actuated by an electronic driver, for causing
the print head to expel the ink droplets in the controlled
fashion.Ordinarily the print head contains multiple
channels, one for each of the nozzles, each of which
conveys liquid ink to one pressure chamber and from that
pressure chamber to one nozzle. Typically each of those
channels draws liquid ink from a larger channel or
manifold, also in the print head, that is in fluid
connection with the ink source through a supply channel 
that is often much longer than the channels that convey
liquid ink from the manifold to the pressure chambers.
When an ink jet printer is to print more than one color of
ink, separate manifolds are provided for each different
color of ink (see e.g. EP-A-0 426 473).As a pressure chamber is alternately actuated and
relaxed, it alternately increases and decreases the
pressure in liquid ink in the channel leading from the
chamber to the nozzle with which that chamber is associated
and also in the channel leading to that chamber from the
manifold. Such an increase in pressure is necessary to
expel a droplet of ink from the nozzle; such a decrease is
necessary to refill the pressure chamber with ink.However, such pressure changes can propagate back
from the pressure chamber to the manifold. Once in the
manifold, such pressure changes can affect the pressure at
other pressure chambers leading from the manifold, causing
non-uniformity in the jetting characteristics from the
nozzles. Non-uniform jetting can interfere with proper
formation of an image on the substrate and become visible
as a variation in the intensity of a printed image or of a
color in a color printed image. Uniform jetting
performance is generally enhanced by making the fluid
