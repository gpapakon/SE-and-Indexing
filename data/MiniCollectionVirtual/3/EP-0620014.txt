<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method of controlling or 
preventing ammonia emission from waste material capable of 

generating ammonia as such or after degradation over a period, said 
process comprising applying on the waste material an effective 

amount of a composition comprising a naturally occuring oil which is 
substantially immiscible with water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of controlling and/or 
preventing emission of odoriferous ammonia from organic wastes, 
especially animal excrements and manure, using a novel composition. Ammonia is the by-product from the degradation of urea by 
enzymes such as urease, which urea is in turn farmed by the 
degradation of uric acid. In poultry houses and in pig farms in 
general, the concentration of ammonia in the atmosphere can be 
sufficiently high for it not only to be a nuisance but also can be 
the cause of eg ammonia blindness in poultry. This in turn can put 
poultry or other animals off their feed and hence cause loss of 
production. In the case of pigs and piglets, presence of excess 
ammonia in the atmosphere where these are housed can cause 
respiratory illnesses. The same applies to other animals, be they 
cattle in a farm or domestic pets such as cats, dogs, birds, 
hamsters or guinea pigs. In all these cases there is a likelihood 
of excreta accumulating which is the prime cause of ammonia build 
up. The presence of excess ammonia in the atmosphere can also be 
harmful to farmworkers who have of necessity to handle such 
materials in order to produce good quality manure which in itself 
can give off ammonia due to degradation. In addition to the above, 
ammonia is one of the sources of acid rain. Many methods have been tried to eliminate/control ammonia 
emission or to mask such odour but with limited success because the 
agents used for such purpose are either themselves odoriferous or 
are unpleasant to the handlers of such agents. Use of masking  
 
agents such as perfumes etc have also been unsuccessful and 
expensive. For instance, US-A-3944908 describes the use of a biological 
fertilizer produced by treating sewage sedimentation sludge with 
sulphite waste liquor and the treated product is mixed with 
pulverised vegetable matter. Mineral acids such as sulphuric acid 
and hydrochloric acid have been used to control odours (cf. US-A-124041). 
US-A-3989498 describes the use of a mixture of glacial 
acetic acid and amyl alcohol for this purpose, the latter having a 
deodorising effect. US-A-5039481 describes a method of scavenging 
ammonia released into the air by decomposition of livestock 
excrement using a scavenging composition comprising a polycarboxylic 
acid such as oxalic acid; 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexane 
dicarboxylic acid; or polyacrylic acid. These acids optionally 
contain solubilizing agents, eg water or a glycol, fragrances and an 
adsorbent which may be sawdust or
