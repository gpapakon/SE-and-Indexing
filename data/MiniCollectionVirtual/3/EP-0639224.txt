<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns selectin variants having an amino acid alteration at a site or sites of a selectin lectin domain amino acid sequence within a region defined by binding sites recognized by blocking monoclonal antibodies to the corresponding selectin unaltered in the lectin domain. Nucleotide sequences encoding such variants, expression vectors containing such nucleotide sequences, and host cells transformed with such expression vectors are also within the scope of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to selectin variants. The invention further
relates to nucleic acids encoding, and to methods and means for preparing
these variants.The selectins are cell adhesion molecules that are unified
structurally by the inclusion of lectin, egf-like and complement binding-like
domains [Bevilacqua, M.P., et al., Science243, 1160-1165 (1989);
Johnson, et al., Cell56, 1033-144 (1989); Lasky, L.A., Cell56, 1045-1055
(1989); Siegelman, M. et al., Science243, 1165-1172 (1989);
Stoolman, L. M., Cell56; 907-910 (1989)], and functionally by their
ability to mediate cell binding through interactions between their lectin
domains and cell surface carbohydrate ligands [Brandley, B., et al.Cell
63, 861-863 (1990); Springer, T., and Lasky, L. A. Nature349 196-197
(1991)].There are three members identified so far in the selectin family of
cell adhesion molecules: L-Selectin (a.k.a. peripheral lymph node homing
receptor (pnHR), LEC-CAM-1, LAM-1, gp90MEL, gp100MEL, gp110MEL, MEL-14
antigen, Leu-8 antigen, TQ-1 antigen, DREG antigen), E-Selectin (LEC-CAM-2,
LECAM-2, ELAM-1) and P-Selectin (LEC-CAM-3, LECAM-3, GMP-140, PADGEM).
The structures of the selectin family members are illustrated in Figure
9.L-Selectin is found on leukocytes and is involved with the
trafficking of lymphocytes to peripheral lymphoid tissues [Gallatin et
al., Nature303, 30-34 (1983)) and with acute neutrophil-mediated
inflammatory responses [Watson, S.R., Nature349 164-167 (1991)]. The
amino acid sequence of L-Selectin and the encoding nucleic acid sequence
are, for example, disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 5,098,833 issued 24 March
1992. L-Selectin appears to recognize sialylated, fucosylated, sulfated
carbohydrate ligand(s) on at least two endothelial glycoproteins [True,
D.D., et al., J .Cell Biol.111, 2757-2764 (1990); Imai, Y. et al., J.
Cell Biol.113 1213-1221 (1991)], one of which has recently been cloned
[Lasky, L. A. et al., Cell (1992), in press and copending U.S.
Application Serial No. 07/834,902 filed 13 February 1992].E-Selectin is an endothelial adhesion molecule that is induced by
various inflammatory stimuli [Bevilacqua, P. P. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA84, 9238-9242 (1987); Luscinakas, F.W. et al., J. Immunol.142
2257-2263 (1589); Kuijpers, T.W. et al., J. Immunol.147 1369-1376
(1991)]. A cloned gene encoding E-Selectin (ELAM-1) is disclosed in U.
S. Patent No. 5,081,034 issued 14 January 1952. E-Selectin recognizes 
the neutrophil and monocyte cell surface carbohydrate, sialyl Lewis x
(sLex) [Lowe J. B. et al.,
