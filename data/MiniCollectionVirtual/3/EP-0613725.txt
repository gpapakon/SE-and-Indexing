<ABSTRACT>
A flotation device for the suction of floated masses comprising a first 
inner tub (12) vertically arranged and communicating at the bottom with a 

second outer tub (26) which surrounds the first tub (12) and operates as 
a manifold for clarified liquid, the second tub communicating with a 

collector resevoir (34) for clarified liquid. At the middle of the first 
tub (12), the flotation device bears a column (40) extending above an 

upper edge of the inner tub (12) and sustaining a support (42) for a 
motorized arm (50) which can be oriented and ending with a suction hood 

(54) which can also be oriented by driving means (66) arranged on the arm 
(50); the column (40), the arm (50) and the suction hood (50) being 

hollow, connected among them and to a pipe (68) for the draining of 
floated particles. The pipe (68) is connected to a reverseble volumetric 

pump (70) which provides both for the removal of the floated particles 
and for the inlet of washing water in order to carry out periodic 

cleaning of the same flotation device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flotation device for continously 
separating solid particles suspended in liquids, especially alimentary 
liquids, in order to proceed with their clarification. The clarification of a liquid may occur by some methods: that is for 
decantation, filtration, centrifugation and flotation. Among all the above-mentioned methods, the flotation is one among the 
most practical, cheap and well suitable ones for a continuos processing 
of large liquid masses. Said flotation process consists in separating solid particles from liquid 
by floating, making transport said particles by gaseous bubbles which are 
adhered to them. As hereinbefore stated, this process is ideal for a continuos processing 
because it is possible to put continuously into a tub-like vessel a 
liquid containing solid particles, to which a gas has been added, to have 
the solid particles transported by the gas and come to the surface and to 
separate, always in a continuos manner, the floating mass from the liquid 
mass purified of the particles. However, it is known that, several times, the solid particles suspended 
in substances to be floated, mainly all alimentary liquids, are so small 
that practically they are not able to conglobate therein the necessary 
gas in order to permit the flotation process. Consequently, coadjuvant 
substances which have the purpose of thickening and then increasing in 
size such particles are added. Typical coadjuvant substances are: 
gelatine, silicon dioxide in colloidal suspension, bentonite and the 
like. In order to make the particles, added to the coadjuvant substances, float 
in size the flotation tub, in a pressurized reactor floating gases, like 
nitrogen, air or oxygen, and also coadjuvant agents, are added to the 
liquid mass to be processed, agents that, adhering as bubbles to the 
increased solid particles, permit them to float in said flotation tub.  At this point it is enough to remove the floating solid particles, 
assembled as a foam, to obtain a greatly clarified liquid in a 
continously operating process. In the present floating systems the removal of the solid particles is 
done in different ways which are all comprised of mechanical systems 
going from simple skimmer shovels to rotary gatherers. However, the skimmer shovels, if they are of a very simple kind, have the 
drawback to require the attention or, at least, a close supervision with 
operating staff in order to keep the shovels always at a such level which 
assure a proper drawing of the foam from

Flotation device by suction which provides to suck the floated foam 
(30) floating over a liquid mass in clarification within a first tub (12) 

characterized by an exhauster dipped into the foam mass (30), but not 
reaching the liquid, moving above said foam mass (30) in order to cover 

all its surface and, consequently, to remove in a substantially uniform 
way the foam from the top of the flotation device. 
Flotation device according to the claim 1, characterized in that the 
first tub (12) is circular and the exhauster fan (54) is fixed to a 

radial arm (50) which is pivotted substantially at the middle of the tub 
(12) and circularly moves in order to cover all the upper surface of the 

tub (12) itself. 
Flotation device according to the claim 2, characterized in that the 
radial arm (50) is fastened to a rotary support (42) which is positioned 

at the center of the tub (12), moved by driving means (44) and installed 
over a substantially vertical column (40) which is fastened to the bottom 

(16) of the same tub (12). 
Flotation device according to the claim 3, characterized in that said 
driving means (44) are fixed over the rotary support (42). 
Flotation device according to the claim 3, characterized in that said 
driving means (44) are placed under the column (40) and therefore under

Flotation device according to the claims 3 to 5, characterized in that 
the radial arm (50) outwardly ends with a pipe-fitting (52) which movable 

about the axis of the same arm (50) carring a suction hood (54) whish may 
be oriented in such a way that it turns a suction inlet opening thereof 

either towards the foam mass (30), when it is intended to suck the same, 
or towards an inner wall (14) of the first tub (12) when it is intended 

to carry out a washing of the tub (12) itself. 
Flotation device according to the claim 6, characterized in that the 
above-mentioned movable pipe-fitting (52) is moved by a motor (66)
