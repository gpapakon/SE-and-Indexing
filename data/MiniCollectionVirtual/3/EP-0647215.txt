<ABSTRACT>
Oligoglycerine mixtures with a high diglycerine content can be produced if glycerine is condensed in the presence of zeolites of formula (I): M2/zO * Al2O3 * x SiO2 * y H2O in which M is an alkaline or alkaline earth metal with the valency z, x stands for numbers from 1.8 to 12 and y for numbers from 0 to 8, the condensation water is continuously removed from the reaction mixture and the reaction is stopped as soon as the quantity of water theoretically required to form diglycerine has been removed. The zeolites are insoluble in the reaction mixture and can easily be separated out after the reaction.

A process for the production of oligoglycerol mixtures 
of increased diglycerol content, 
characterized in that
 
glycerol is condensed in the presence of zeolites corresponding 

to formula 
(I)
M
2/z
O * Al

O   (I)
 
in which M is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal 

having a valency of z, x is a number of 1.8 to 12 and y is 
a number of 0 to 8,
 
the water of condensation is continuously removed from the 

reaction mixture and the reaction is terminated when the 
quantity of water theoretically necessary for the formation 

of diglycerol has been separated. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
zeolites selected from the group consisting of zeolite X, 

zeolite Y, zeolite L, zeolite A and mordenite are used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the zeolites are used in quantities of 1 to 10% by 
weight, based on the glycerol. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 the condensation is carried out at 
temperatures of 200 to 260°C. 
A process as claimed in at last one of claims .1 to 4, 

characterized in that
 the zeolites are separated from the 
oligoglycerol mixture after the reaction.
