<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method 
for providing a low-fat frozen cooked dough product which 

substantially retains its palatability upon microwave 
reheating from the frozen state. The method of the 

invention includes the steps of mixing ingredients 
comprising flour, water and a leavening agent to form a 

dough. The dough contains less than 2% fat. After fully 
proofing the dough, the dough is contacted with steam as 

the sole source of heat used to cook the dough. 
Thereafter, the cooked dough is frozen. The frozen 

cooked dough may then be subjected to microwave heating 
by the end user to provide a palatable warmed, cooked 

dough product which has retained its palatability, is not 
tough, and is substantially similar in taste and 

appearance to counterpart dough product which has been 
cooked by conventional convection baking. The cooked 

dough product is preferably a bagel type dough product, 
but may be any low-fat dough, such as pizza crust.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method 
for providing a frozen, low-fat cooked dough product 
which substantially retains its palatability upon 
microwave reheating. More particularly, the present 
invention is directed to a method for making bagels and 
other low-fat dough products which can be frozen and 
which retain their palatability when reheated in a 
microwave oven. The method utilizes steam as the sole 
source of cooking heat prior to freezing the cooked dough 
product. There is an increasing trend to provide frozen 
food products which can be reheated in a microwave oven 
for rapid and easy utilization in the household or for 
heating machine vendable food products. The modern 
consumer of processed food seeks to achieve a high 
quality food product with a minimum of preparation. 
While microwave energy will rapidly heat many food 
products, not all food products are adaptable to 
microwave heating to deliver the same quality as is 
associated with traditional convection oven heating. 
This lack of quality is particularly prevalent in the 
area of microwave reheated baked goods. It is an even 
more acute problem with the microwave heating of low-fat 
baked goods, such as bagels. Traditionally, bagels are prepared by a unique 
two-stage cooking process wherein a dough is formed into 
donut shaped rings and proofed. The rings are first 
cooked for a period of time in heated water followed by 
baking in a convection oven. The two-stage cooking 
process results in a baked product with a unique chewy 
texture that is well associated with bagels.  In the traditional manufacture of bagels, a 
dough is utilized which has no added fat, i.e., the dough 
consists essentially of flour, water, yeast, salt and 
sugar. The problems associated with the use of microwave 
energy for heating leavened dough products is exacerbated 
for non-fat and low-fat baked products having less than 
about 2% fat. Even without freezing of the baked low-fat 
bagel, microwave heating at the time of utilization 
results in changing the texture of the bagel or low-fat 
baked dough product to a chewy, rubbery consistency that 
may become so tough that it is difficult to tear such 
products. The problem of providing microwaveable baked 
goods has been recognized and various formulation 
solutions have been proposed. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,560,559 
and 4,463,020, both to Ottenburg, discuss the preparation 
of yeast-raised dough products having improved resistance 
to deterioration caused by microwave heating. The '020

<CLAIMS>
A method for providing a frozen, low-fat cooked 
dough product, which substantially retains its palatability 

upon microwave reheating comprising the steps of: 

(a) mixing dry ingredients comprising flour and 
a leavening agent with water to form a dough; 
(b) proofing said dough; 
(c) contacting said dough with steam as the sole 
source of heat used to cook said dough; and 
(d) freezing said cooked dough; 
 
whereby upon subsequent microwave reheating of said frozen 

steam cooked dough, a dough product is provided having a 
palatable texture. 
A method in accordance with claim 1, wherein said 
steam contacting is for a period of from about 2 to about 20 

minutes. 
A method in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein said steam contacting is at a temperature of from 

about 212째F to about 275째F (about 100.0째C to about 135.0째C). 
A method in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 
3, wherein said dough has yeast at a level of from about 0.5 

to about 5 baker's percent, salt at a level of from about 
1.5 to about 2.5 baker's percent, sugar at a level of from 

about 2 to about 4 baker's percent and water at a level of 
from about 50 to about 70 baker's percent. 
A method in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 
4, wherein a coloring or browning agent is applied to the 

surface of said dough.
