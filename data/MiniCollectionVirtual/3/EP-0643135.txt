<ABSTRACT>
A DNA containing a gene that codes for aspartokinase III from a bacterium of the genus 
Escherichia
 and has in the coding 
region thereof a variation that releases the inhibition of aspartokinase III feedback by lysine; a recombinant DNA comprising 

the above DNA joined to a vector DNA capable of autonomous replication in the cell of a bacterium of the genus 
Escherichia
; 
a micro-organism of the genus 
Escherichia
, that has been transformed by introducing the recombinant DNA into the cells; 
and a process for producing L-threonine by culturing the micro-organism in a fermentation medium to accumulate L-threonine 

in 
the medium and harvesting the same from the medium. The invention process has provided AK III genes originating in a bacterium 

of the genus 
Escherichia
 and sufficiently released from the feedback inhibition caused by lysine. An improved threonine-producing 
bacterium has been obtained by introducing the above genes into a conventional threonine-producing 

bacterium. The 
invention successfully provides a process for producing L-threonine by an improved fermentation method using the above threonine-producing 

bacterium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the microbiological
industry, and describes a method for the production of L-threonine
by fermentation. L-threonine is an essential amino
acid, and it is used as a component of various nutritional
mixtures for medical purposes. Furthermore, it is used as a
feed additive for animals, as a reagent in the pharmaceutical
and chemical industries, and as a growth factor for the
production of amino acids such as lysine and homoserine by
microorganisms.In the past, bacteria separated from the natural
environment or artificial mutants of such bacteria have been
used as microorganisms for the production of L-threonine by
fermentation. Many L-threonine-producing artificial mutants
are known, the majority of which are resistant to α-amino-β-hydroxyvaleric
acid and belong to the genus Escherichia,
Serratia, Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium. Regarding
Escherichia, in JPA 55-131397, JPA 59-31691, JPA 56-15696 and
JPW 3-501682 are there described methods for the production 
of L-threonine by bacteria transformed by recombinant
plasmids containing threonine operons.Also, of the heretofore known threonine-producing
bacteria, Escherichia coli BKIIM (VKPM) B-3996 strain has
exhibited the most superior level of threonine production and
coefficient of consumption (JPW 3-501682). According to the
present invention, "coefficient of consumption" refers to the
number of grams of sugar required for the production of one
gram of threonine. If this bacterium is cultured in an
experimental fermenter, adding sugar-ammonia to the culture
medium in response to the signals from the pH sensor, then
the maximum degree of biosynthesis of threonine is 85 g/l,
and the coefficient of consumption is 2 g of sugar per one
gram of threonine.Aspartokinase (hereunder abbreviated to AK) is an enzyme
which converts aspartic acid to β-phosphoaspartic acid, and
it is the main regulatory site of the biosynthesis pathway of
aspartic acid and its derivative amino acids. As shown in
Fig. 1, there are three types of AK from E. coli (AK I, AK
II, AK III) and the first two of these are bifunctional
enzymes having homoserine dehydrogenase (hereunder sometimes
abbreviated to HD) activity. One of these is AK I-HD I which
is coded for by the thrA gene, and the other is AK II-HD II
which is coded for the metL(M) gene.Only AK III is a monofunctional enzyme, and it is the 
product of a gene named lysC, and is known to undergo
repression and feedback inhibition by lysine. On the other
hand, AK I undergoes concerted repression by
