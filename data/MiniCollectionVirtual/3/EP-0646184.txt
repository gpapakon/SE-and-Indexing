<ABSTRACT>
A method for desulfurizing molten steel while the steel is subjected to a vaccum dehydrogenation treatment, comprising adding to the steel in a vacuum chamber a desulfurizing agent in lump form and comprising, by weight percent, about 50 % CaO, about 38 % CaF2, and about 10 % MgO.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the
desulfurization of steel being vacuum treated in a
vacuum degassing unit such as an RH degasser, with
use of a desulfurization agent consisting essentially of calcium
oxide, calcium fluoride and magnesium oxide.U.S. Patent No. 4,661,151 discloses a
first treating agent for steel desulfurization
comprising CaO, CaF2, and from 10 to 60 weight %
MgO, which agent, in fine powder form, is injected,
with the aid of an inert carrier gas, into a ladle
of molten steel and below a passage extending
downwardly through a slag layer on the metal in the
ladle and upwardly leading to an inert atmosphere
treating chamber or a reduced pressure treating
chamber such as an RH degassing apparatus. The
desulfurization agent has a weight ratio of
(%CaF2)/[(%CaO) + (%CaF2)] x 100% = 20 to 80%. The
inert gas and entrained fine desulfurizer particles
float upward through the passage and into the
treating chamber. The CaO and CaF2 serve as
desulfurizers, and the MgO serves to protect the 
refractories in the equipment from erosion. A
second desulfurization treating agent, comprising
CaO and CaF2, also is used.In U.S. Patent No. 4,517,015 there is
disclosed a steel refining method comprising blowing
an inert gas into the steel from below and from
above the surface of a slag overlying the molten
steel. The inert gas can carry a desulfurization
agent.U.S. Patent No. 4,341,554 discloses a steel
desulfurization process in which molten metal in a
ladle is covered with a synthetic slag, particulate
lime, of a size retained on a number 80 sieve, is
added to cover the slag, then finely powdered lime
is injected below the slag surface and rises in the
bath to combine with the larger lime particles to
form a crust which deters entry of air into the bath.In U.S. Patent No. 4,277,279, there is
disclosed a method and apparatus for dispensing a
fluidized stream of particulate material useful for
desulfurization of molten ferrous metals.German patent application 254,216 A1 shows
and describes a method of desulfurizing molten metal
in an RH type treatment apparatus, wherein a solid
calcium-containing desulfurizing agent, in filled
wire form, is injected, without a carrier gas, into
one leg of the RH vessel after the melt has been
vacuum deoxidized and before it has been vacuum
dehydrogenated. Sulfur thereby is reduced to below
0.005%, with H2 below 3 ppm.Japanese published application No. 1129925
discloses addition, to molten steel in an RH vessel,
a treating agent comprising Fe-Ca-Ni-Si, Ni-Ca,
Ni-Fe-Ca or Cu-Ca

<CLAIMS>
A method of desulfurizing molten steel, comprising introducing the molten
steel from a ladle into a vacuum chamber of a vacuum degassing apparatus and

therein subjecting the molten steel to a vacuum dehydrogenation treatment, adding
to the molten steel a desulfurizing agent consisting essentially of calcium oxide,

calcium fluoride and magnesium oxide and desulfurizing the steel while it is
subjected to the vacuum dehydrogenation treatment, characterised in that the

desulfurizing agent comprises from 70 wt.% to 40 wt.% CaO, from
50 wt.% to 10 wt.% CaF
2
, and from 20 wt.% to 5 wt.%
MgO, and the desulfurizing agent is added to the steel in the vacuum chamber in

solid lump form with an average particle size from 6mm (1/4 inch) to
76mm (3 inches).
A method according to claim 1, wherein the vacuum degassing apparatus
is an RH degasser.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the desulfurizing agent
comprises about 50% CaO, about 38% CaF
2
, and about 10% MgO.
A method according to any one of claims I to 3, wherein the steel
contained in the ladle is covered with a basic desulfurizing and deoxidizing slag

comprising lime and calcium aluminate.
A method according to any one of claims I to 4, wherein the steel
introduced into the vacuum degassing chamber contains over 0.003 wt.% and up

to 0.010 wt.% sulfur and at least about one-half of the sulfur content of the
steel is remov
ed in the desulfurization treatment. 
A method according to claim 5, wherein, when the initial sulfur
content of the steel is in the range from 0.004 to 0.005 wt.%, desulfurizer is added

in a single batch to the vacuum degassing chamber, and when the initial sulfur
content of the steel is 0.006 wt.% or higher, desulfurizer is added in multiple

batches of a number sufficient to reduce the sulfur content of the steel to
0.003 wt.% or less.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the
combined desulfurization and dehydrogenation treatment is carried out for a

period of at least about 10 minutes.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the
desulfurizing agent has an average maximum particle size less than 25mm

(1 inch).
