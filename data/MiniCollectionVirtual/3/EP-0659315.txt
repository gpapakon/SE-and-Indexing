<DESCRIPTION>
 SHOCK ISOLATION FOR SELECTIVE CALL RECEIVERSField of the Invention This invention relates generally to shock isolation techniques in electronic devices, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for improving the reliability of a selective call receiver by reducing the amplitude of deflections of the selective call receiver's constituent parts (i.e. printed circuit boards, housing, electronic components, etc.) which occur in response to sudden mechanical impacts or shocks.Background of the Invention Communication systems in general, and paging systems in particular, have attained widespread use. In such paging systems, transmitted call signals are used to call selected receivers for the purpose of transmitting information from a base station to the selected receivers. Modern paging receivers have achieved multifunction capabilities through the use of microprocessors which allow the receivers to respond to information containing various combinations of tone, tone and voice, or data messages in a variety of modes. This information may be transmitted using several paging coding schemes and message formats. Some considerations governing the successful operation of a paging receiver relate to the portability of the receiver, battery saving, available memory, radio spectrum availability, and fast response time. Equally important, however, is reliability, one aspect of which is the device's ability to continue to function properly after sudden mechanical impacts and shocks (e.g., dropping the unit onto a hard surface) .Modern selective call receiver units generally include relatively thin printed circuit boards, housings which are typically made of a plastic type material, and fragile electronic components. The plastic housing's front and back planes typically have a low frequency response to 

 sudden impact resulting in relatively large deflections which will result in secondary impacts with the internal printed circuit board components. Certain ones of these components are fragile in nature; i.e. some components are constructed of quartz, ceramic, and silicon. Each of these components themselves have a natural frequency response to impact that amplifies the incoming shock.The relatively thin printed circuit boards themselves have a low frequency response to shock resulting in large deflections. They also have a variable frequency of vibration response across the printed circuit board due to the variation in components' weight across the board. Furthermore, vibrations of the printed circuit board
