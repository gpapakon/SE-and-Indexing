<ABSTRACT>
Described is a photochromic compound for, in particular, the colouring of optical elements made of plastic material. The compound is characterized in that aromatic groups are chemically bonded rigidly in the 2-position of a photochromic 2H-pyran to give a spiropyran.

Photochromic spiro- or dispiropyrans in the structure of which aromatic
groups are bonded together chemically rigidly in the 2-position of a

diphenyl-2H-pyran, which can be substituted, of diphenyl-2H-naphthopyran,
of substituted dinaphthyl-2H-pyran or of substituted

phenylnaphthyl-2H-pyran, with the exception of spiropyrans according to
EP 0 625 518 A1, with the structure


Photochromic spiro- or dispiropyrans according to claim 1, in the case of
which the aromatic groups are phenyl groups.
Photochromic spiro- or dispiropyrans according to claim 1 or 2, in the
case of which a fluorene, dibenzosuberone, anthrone, xanthene or

thioxanthene is formed by means of the bonding of the aromatic groups.
Photochromic spiro- or dispiropyrans according to claim 1 or 2, in the
case of which the aromatic groups are bonded together by means of 1 to

3 CH
2
 bridges.
Photochromic dispiropyrans according to one of the claims 1 to 4, the
photochromic molecules of which carry two photochromic part-systems

which react differently in colour and in kinetics.
Use of the photochromic spiro- or dispiropyrans according to one of the
claims 1 to 5 for pigmentation of optical elements made of a plastic

material.
