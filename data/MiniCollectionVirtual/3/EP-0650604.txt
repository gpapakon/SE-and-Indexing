<ABSTRACT>
A flip-up mount is provided for a night vision system. The mount comprises a carriage (22) which is configured to engage a coupling device (18) provided on the night vision system and secure the system in place. A pivotal armature (30) is attached to the carriage and extends from a pivot axis. The armature pivots between a first operational position enabling an operator to use the system, and a second stowed position. An anchor (76, 78) secures the pivot point to a helmet worn by the operator of the system. The pivot point further comprises a brace (70) having an axle shaft (62), a sleeve (42) integral to the armature and rotatable about the shaft, and a spring biased locking member (56) securing the sleeve in a selected one of the first and the second positions. A supplemental chin strap (140) is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a night vision
system and more particularly to a mount for a night
vision system.Night vision systems are commonly used by military
and law enforcement personnel for conducting operations
in low light or night conditions. These systems
intensify the ambient light to produce an output image
which is visible to the human eye. Such night vision
systems either take the form of binoculars, having
separate eye pieces for each eye, or monoculars, having
only a single eye piece. It is common for operators of night vision systems
to desire hands-free operation in which the binocular
or monocular systems can be mounted to either a face
mask worn on the operator's face, or to the operator's
helmet. The typical face mask mounting assembly
comprises a rod which is held to the operator's face by
use of a strap which wraps around the head and connects
to the rod at two or more places. At the centre of the
forehead portion of the rod, a mount is provided which
would engage the binocular or monocular system. Helmet
mounting assemblies are also available, in which the
rod mounts directly to the operator's helmet. A helmet
mounting assembly of this kind is disclosed in US-A-5331459.
The components comprising a face mask or
helmet mounting system are referred to as headgear.It frequently becomes necessary for the operator
of a night vision system to temporarily remove the
system from its operational position. For example, an
operator of a vehicle such as a truck or a helicopter
travelling during low light conditions would typically
use a face mask or helmet mounted night vision system.
However, if it becomes necessary to quickly glance at
items within the vehicle, such as a map or an
instrument gauge, the operator would need to either
dislodge the night vision system from within its locked
position, or peek around the edges of the eye piece of
the system. Although installation and removal of the 
night vision system from its carriage on the headgear is
a relatively simple task, it does require a certain
degree of skill and can be hampered by the stress of the
operational environment.A mount for a night vision system which enables the
system to be pivoted from an operational to a non-operational,
stowed position without requiring removal of
the system is disclosed in US-A-4987608, such a mount
being referred to as a flip-up mount.According to the invention, there is provided a
mount for a night vision system, the mount comprising a
carriage configured to engage a coupling device provided
on

pivoting when in said operational and stowed positions and
a second axial position for pivoting the armature (30)

between said operational and stowed positions.
A mount according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the
sleeve is movable axially along said shaft and the locking

means comprises a locking member (58) and spring means (54)
biasing the sleeve (42) towards axial engagement with the

locking means (58).
A mount according to claim 3 and 4, wherein the
spring means (54) is arranged to urge the sleeve (42)
