<ABSTRACT>
A method for improving the qualities of meat which 
comprises treating a meat piece with an ester represented by 

the following formula (1): 

   wherein one of R¹ and R² represents a saturated or 
unsaturated monocarboxylic acid residue having 2 to 

24 carbon atoms while the other represents a 
dicarboxylic acid residue;

 
a meat piece which has been treated by this method, and a 

composition comprising the ester and a protease are 
disclosed. By treating a meat (for example, cattle meat, 

fowl meat) in accordance with the method of the present 
invention, a meat piece having a tender texture and a high 

juiciness can be obtained, in particular, in the case of a 
meat piece of a certain size or larger or minced meat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for improving the
qualities of meat and a meat piece which has been treated by
this method. More particularly, it relates to a method for
improving the qualities of meat whereby a meat having a
tender texture and being highly juicy and having a good
flavor even after cooking (for example, grilling, frying) can
be provided and a meat piece which has been treated by this
method.There are a number of meat dishes which are prepared
by using meat pieces of a certain size cut off from cattle
meats (for example, beef, pork) or fowl meats (for example,
chicken, duck) or molded materials (for example, hamburger
steak) comprising minced meat obtained from these meats as
the main component together with vegetables and seasonings.
In the case of these dishes, it is desirable that the meat is
eaten in a state of having an appropriate tenderness and
being rich in meat juice (i.e., being highly juicy)
containing the taste components, regardless of the cooking
procedure, e.g., grilling (for example, grilling over an open
fire, baking in a casserole or grilling on a cooking plate
such as a frying pan), frying or deep frying. In the case of
a steak or a cutlet prepared from not a molded material but a 
meat piece of a large size, the tenderness and the juiciness
are important factors for providing a delicious meat product.
In the case of a molded material such as a hamburger steak,
it is desirable that the product is eaten in a state of
having a fluffy and smooth texture. However, such a meat
piece or a molded material comprising minced meat as the main
component as the one described above is generally tend to
become hard and tough when heated. It also has a tendency to
lose the meat juice. Furthermore, a meat with poor qualities
becomes not only hard but also sinewy and thus suffers from a
serious deterioration in the texture. Accordingly, it has
been required to develop a method for improving the qualities
of a meat which makes it possible to provide a tender and
delicious meat product having a good texture even by using
such a meat of poor qualities as the one described above.Some methods have been proposed to improve the
qualities of meat (for example, tenderizing the meat or
improving the keeping qualities thereof). For example, JP-A-49-20353
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application) discloses a method
wherein an organic acid monoglyceride (for example,
acetylated monoglyceride) is used. Further, JP-A-4-278063
discloses a method
