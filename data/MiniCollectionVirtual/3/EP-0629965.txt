<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for data acquisition from electronic control apparatuses, in particular in motor vehicles, it being the intention to avoid any influencing of the program flow inside the control apparatus during the data acquisition. To this end, it is provided that the data are acquired simultaneously and transmitted via a parallel interface (16) to a measuring system (18).

<CLAIMS>
Method for acquiring data from an electronic
control unit in which the data (56, 58, 60) of the

control unit (10) are stored in a dual port RAM (22) of
a measuring system (18) via an interface (16),

characterized

in that a program for operating a motor vehicle
with different program levels runs in the control

unit, at least one program level being synchronous
with the ignition and at least one program level

having timed synchronism,
in that specific trigger information (50, 52, 54)
is made available by the control unit,
in that the trigger information (50, 52, 54) is
stored with the data (56, 58, 60) in the dual port

RAM (22),
and in that the trigger information (50, 52, 54)
permits data (56, 58, 60) concerning the different

program levels to be assigned to the measuring
system.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the data are fed via a serial interface (24) to a

control computer (26) which buffers the transmitted
data.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the data are copied from

the buffer (32) onto a main memory, in particular a
hard disk (34), as a function of a selectable event. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the event is copied with an adjustable forward

travel time and/or overtravel time.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the status of the data

acquisition is output via a display unit (38) which is
connected to the control computer (26).
