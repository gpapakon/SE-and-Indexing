<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a stencil discharge apparatus having 
two shafts (11,21) mounted at a specific spacing; a plurality of 

rotators (14,13) which are mounted in pairs on the two shafts (11,21), 
and rotate for gripping one end of the stencil paper (2) to 

be removed from a printing drum (1) and conveying the stencil 
paper (2) thus removed; a receiving section (19) for holding the 

stencil paper (2) removed from the printing drum (1) and conveyed 
by the pairs of rotators (14,15); and a different-diameter 

rotator (16,20) being mounted on either end of at least one of 
the two shafts (11,21) mounted with at least one of the pair of 

rotators (14,15), said different-diameter rotator (16,20) including a 
small-diameter portion (17,21) having approximately the same 

outside diameter as the outside diameter of one rotator (14), 
and a large-diameter portion (18,22) having a larger outside 

diameter than the small-diameter portion (17,21) in order to 
prevent the stencil paper (2) from going in between said 

different-diameter rotator (16,20) and the shaft (21) of the other 
rotator (15) rotating in engagement with the one rotator (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper handling apparatus,
particularly but not exclusively a stencil discharge
apparatus for removing a stencil wrapped with viscosity
of ink on a stencil mounting member such as a printing
cylinder of a mimeograph equipment.Generally in a mimeograph equipment, an ink supply
means is provided inside of a drum, and a mimeograph
stencil paper can be wrapped with the viscosity of ink
around the outer peripheral surface of a circumferential
wall which is pervious to ink. To discard a used stencil
paper, generally a stencil discharge means comprising
stripping pawls, a pair of discharge rollers, and a
stencil receiving box is provided in the vicinity of the
drum.That is, the spent stencil paper is released, with
its one end gripped by the stripping pawls in accordance
with the rotation of the printing drum, from the surface
of the printing drum by means of a pair of discharge
rollers, and then is pushed for discharging directly into
the stencil receiving box. US-A-4,966,073 discloses a rotary mimeographic
printing apparatus which comprises a rotary drum for
mounting on a peripheral surface thereof a perforated
stencil. A clamp pivotally supported on the rotary drum is
provided for clamping one end of the stencil in such a
manner that the stencil may be wound around the peripheral
surface of the rotary drum in response to rotation of the
rotary drum. A structure for removing the stencil from the
rotary drum after printing is finished and a stencil guide
disposed above the rotary drum and engageable with the
clamp so as to move following the pivotal movement of the
clamp are also provided.Figure 6 of the present application shows a paper handling
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. In Fig. 6 when a stencil paper is taken into the
stencil receiving box by means of an upper roller 31 and 
a lower roller 32 which constitute a discharge roller
pair 33, it becomes necessary to prevent the used stencil
paper to be discharged from rolling back onto the
discharge rollers. In other than the rollers of the
discharge roller pair 33, a guide member comprising an
upper guide plate 34 and a lower guide plate 35 is
provided.If a gap between the upper and lower guide members
is set narrow, an increased load will be required to
convey the used stencil paper by the discharger roller
pair, giving an adverse effect to the used stencil
discharging operation of the discharge roller pair.
Therefore, between the upper and lower guide members
there must be provided a certain degree of

<CLAIMS>
A paper handling apparatus for removing sheets of
paper (2), e.g. stencils from a drum (1), the apparatus

comprising: a pair of spaced apart shafts (11, 21),
at least one pair (4) of opposed

rollers (14, 15)
being mounted on the pair of said shafts

(11, 21); and a receiving section (19) for receiving paper
(2) removed from the drum (1), the opposed pairs (4) of

rollers (14, 15) being rotatable to convey, in use, a
sheet of paper (2) from the drum (1) to the receiving

section (19); characterised by including at least one
different diameter roller (16, 20) mounted on one of said

shafts (11, 21), said different diameter roller (16, 20),
including a small-diameter portion (17, 24) having less

than, or approximately the same, outside diameter as the
outside diameter of one roller (14, 15), and a large-diameter

portion (18, 22) having a larger outside diameter
than the small-diameter portion (17, 24), the small-diameter

portion (17, 24) alternating with the large-diameter portion (18, 22)
in the circumferential direction of the different diameter roller

16, 20), 
in order to

prevent said paper (2) from going in between said
different diameter roller and the other one of said shafts

(21, 11). 
A paper handling apparatus according to claim 1, in
which guide members (9, 10) are mounted between said shafts
