<ABSTRACT>
This system can prevent contamination of the inside of a sealed box containing 
a wafer, and also, prevent contaminants from being brought into an apparatus for processing 

the wafer, which is connected to a clean tunnel. The system comprises a box where a wafer 
is placed gastightly in a clean atmosphere, and a transferring device which transfers 

the box on a carrier in order to transfer it through the sealed space of a clean 
tunnel. In the sealed space of the tunnel, there are provided a device for delivering 

the box to the carrier from outside the sealed space, and a device for delivering the wafer 
in the box to the processing apparatus. In the sealed space of the tunnel, a cleaning 

device is arranged to clean the outer surface of the box.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substrate
transportation system for transporting substrates such as
semi-conductor substrates or liquid crystal substrates through
a clean atmosphere, suitable for use especially in
manufacturing processes of semi-conductors or liquid crystals.Lately, Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit elements have
become more highly integrated, and require a more dust-free
manufacturing system. Especially, in a transporting system,
not only dust-free environment but also long service life are
necessary. For this reason, a magnetic floating transporting
system is being developed as a wafer transporting system for
use in manufacturing apparatus for the next generation
semi-conductor.The magnetic floating transporting system first floats a
carrier device loaded with wafers and holds the carrier device
in a floated position by virtue of magnetic force of electric
magnets, then transports the carrier device without any
contacts between surroundings by utilizing a linear motor
mechanism for example. Since wafers can be transported in a
sealed vacuum tunnel or in a clean tunnel filled with clean
nitrogen gas atmosphere without making contacts with
surrounding elements, this magnetic transporting system does
not generate any dust troubles and is capable of realizing a 
highly clean transporting system. At certain locations of the
clean tunnel, the magnetic floating transporting system is
combined with processing apparatus such as photo-lithography
device or ion plating apparatus, and the transported wafers
will be carried to these processing apparatus to be processed.Even in such combined systems comprising the processing
apparatus and the wafer transporting apparatus, wafers must be
stored outside of the system, or must be stored in or carried
through the ambient air while they are being moved toward other
systems. The present applicant has developed a technique for
storing and transporting the wafers in a tightly sealed box
having a highly clean inner atmosphere such as a vacuum, and
has filed a patent application therefor (JP-A-6 198 160).However, although the wafers may be retained in a tightly
sealed box having a clean atmosphere, and carried through the
ambient air to be moved to the tunnel-type magnetic
transporting system, and transferred to and transported by a
carrier arranged in a tightly sealed space, at least the outer
surface of the box is carried into the clean tunnel, when they
are entering the clean tunnel of the magnetic transporting
system.Therefore, although the clean
