<ABSTRACT>
Dispersed polymers comprising microparticles stabilized with two kinds of steric stabilizers are disclosed. The first stabilizer is an essentially linear polymer having a terminal end attached to the microparticle. The second stabilizer is a graft or comb polymer comprising an acrylic backbone having side chains. This stabilizer, in contrast to the first stabilizer, may be attached to the core by means of a plurality of functional groups placed along the backbone of the graft polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a dispersed polymer which is characterized as a dual stabilized microparticle. In particular, such a dispersed polymer comprises two kinds of steric stabilizers attached to the macromolecular core or microparticle.Dispersed polymers, including both non-aqueous dispersion (NAD) polymers and microgels, have been found useful as rheology control agents and as toughening agents in coating compositions. Such dispersed polymers are referred to as sterically stabilized microparticles. They comprise a microparticle or core component and, attached to this core component, a polymeric stabilizer component which sterically stabilizes the core component in the dispersing medium. The microparticle or core component is a macromolecular polymer which is not soluble in the dispersing medium, either because of incompatibility or, as in microgels, by substantial crosslinking. The sterically stabilized microparticles are conventionally prepared by free radical addition polymerization of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, which constitute the core, in the presence of the stabilizing polymer component and a hydrocarbon dispersing medium.Typically, the stabilizer component is one of two kinds: (1) a linear polymer which may have a single or a plurality of polymerizable functional groups along the polymeric chain, or (2) a graft or block polymer composed of two segments, one of which is soluble and the other insoluble in the dispersing medium. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,591,533 to Antonelli et al. teaches stabilizers of the first kind, are linear acrylic polymers prepared by free radical addition polymerization of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. The stabilizers thus formed have a plurality of further polymerizable vinyl unsaturated groups distributed randomly along the polymer chain. U.S. Patent No. 4,746,714 to Spinelli et al. discloses other stabilizing polymers of the first kind, which are also linear acrylic polymers, but which are prepared by what is referred to as group transfer polymerization process, so that the stabilizing polymers each have a single terminal functional group for attachment to a microparticle. Finally, U.S. Patent No. 5,010,140 to Antonelli et al. discloses still other stabilizing polymers of the first kind, but which are prepared using a catalytic chain transfer agent containing cobalt. The latter stabilizing polymers also have terminal vinyl unsaturation.Examples of the second kind of stabilizing polymers employed to sterically stabilize and
