<ABSTRACT>
Copper and/or nickel sulphide ore concentrates of high intrinsic energy value are oxygen smelted by introducing such concentrates via feeds (32) into a closed loop extraction circuit in which a molten sulphide carrier composition is forcibly circulated by an R-H unit (14) through lower hearth (10) at which feed of the concentrates takes place, and upper hearth (12) at which controlled oxidation with technically pure oxygen through top lances (4) takes place to oxidise copper sulphide and iron sulphide in the concentrate to iron oxide. Copper is removed via line (42). Slag containing iron oxide is discharged via weir (22) into a secondary circuit in hearths (24 and 28). Carbonaceous reductant added to the slag in hearth (28) reduces the iron oxide in the slag to hot iron product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the oxygen smelting of 
copper sulphide ore concentrates, nickel sulphide ore 
concentrates or bulk copper and nickel sulphide ore 
concentrates, and is particularly concerned with the 
direct oxygen smelting of those of such concentrates 
which have a high intrinsic energy value. Existing copper smelting technologies include: 
Top Blown Rotary Converting Electric Smelting Noranda Continuous Smelting Mitsubishi Continuous Smelting Inco Flash Smelting Outokumpu Flash Smelting For those concentrates with relatively low 
intrinsic energy value (i.e. those where large net 
amounts of exothermic heat are not generated), high level 
oxygen enrichment can be used with the above 
technologies, and in certain cases depending both on the 
existence of high copper/sulphur ratio and a low sulphide 
iron content in a bornitic concentrate, it is possible to 
produce blister copper directly in a single step using 
technically pure oxygen ie oxygen of commercial purity 
(95% or higher). Typical chalcopyrite copper concentrates, on the 
other hand, when oxidised directly to blister copper, 
generate reaction heat in excess of that required for 
autogenous operation, even at low levels of oxygen 
enrichment. The inability to dissipate this additional 
heat with current used technology prevents or complicates 
the use of higher levels of oxygen enrichment. Besides the excess heat generation problem already  
 
referred to, single step smelting of copper concentrate 
with relatively high levels of certain impurity elements 
(Arsenic, Antimony and Bismuth) tend to produce final 
blister copper with unacceptable levels of these 
impurities because their elimination is generally lower 
than by conventional smelting routes. As a consequence 
direct smelting to blister copper has to date been 
restricted to relatively clean concentrates. GB-A-2048309 (corresponding to EP-A-016595 and 
US-A-4334918) discloses a process for recovering non-ferrous 
metals from their sulphide ores wherein a molten 
sulphide carrier composition (or matte) is forcibly 
circulated through an extraction circuit from which the 
non-ferrous metal or its sulphide can be continuously 
extracted at an elevated temperature. The method 
involves introducing the sulphide ore into the matte at 
an ore-receiving station so that the ore is dissolved in 
or melted by the matte, and contacting the matte 
containing said ore with oxygen at an oxidation station 
so as to oxidise at least part of the ore and/or the 
matte, heat generated

<CLAIMS>
A method of oxygen smelting of a copper/nickel 
sulphide ore concentrate of high intrinsic energy value, 

comprising the steps of forcibly circulating a molten 
sulphide carrier composition through a closed loop 

extraction circuit from which at least one product 
selected from copper, nickel and sulphides thereof can be 

continuously extracted at an elevated temperature, 
introducing the ore concentrate into the molten carrier 

composition at an ore receiving station so that the ore 
is dissolved in or melted by the composition, contacting 

the molten carrier composition containing said ore with 
an oxidising gas containing at least 30 vol % oxygen at 

an oxidation station so as to oxidise at least part of 
the ore and/or the molten carrier composition, and 

utilising heat generated during the oxidation step as a 
result of oxidation of the ore concentrate, characterised 

in that the heat utilising step is effected (a) by 
smelting the copper and/or nickel sulphide ore 

concentrate of high intrinsic energy value with another 
mineral sulphide concentrate of low or negative intrinsic energy 

value selected from high-grade zinc concentrate, high-grade 
lead concentrate and a bulk flotation concentrate 

containing both lead and zinc, and/or (b)by reducing iron 
oxide in slag produced in the method to a liquid iron 

product, and recovering such liquid iron product. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the oxidising 
gas is technically pure oxygen. 
A method as claimed in any claim 1 or 2, wherein 
copper is extracted as copper metal and nickel is 

extracted as nickel sulphide. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the ore concentrate is ex
posed to radiant heat before it  
 

is introduced into the molten carrier composition so as 
to vaporise labile sulphur and other volatile sulphides, 

and wherein such vapours are removed and condensed. 
A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the ore 
concentrate is exposed to radiant heat by causing it to 

pass down inclined walls at the ore receiving station 
before such ore is introduced into the molten carrier 

composition. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the copper and/or nickel sulphide ore concentrate is a 

chalcopyrite ore concentrate. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the copper and/or nickel sulphide ore concentrate is 

smelted with a high-grade zinc ore concentrate. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein said iron oxide reducing and liquid iron product 

recovering steps are conducted in a secondary circuit 
utilising a molten slag phase removed from said closed 

loop extraction circuit. 
A method as claimed in claim 8, wherein (i) reduction 
of the iron oxide is effected by addition of reductant to 

the secondary circuit, (ii) the amount of reductant added 
to an upstream part of the secondary circuit is 

restricted so that hot metal initially formed collects 
residual copper and other reducible element impurities 

that leave said closed loop circuit dissolved in the 
slag, and (iii) the initially formed hot metal is 

collected and returned to said closed loop circuit.
