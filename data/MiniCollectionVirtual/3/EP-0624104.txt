<ABSTRACT>
The catheterisation set for the insertion of the catheter into a blood vessel, consisting of a puncture canula (10) with a fitting (16) having a gripping device (25), a catheter (13) surrounding the canula (10) with a catheter fitting (41) and a guide wire (12) which can be moved axially in the passage of the canula (10) is distinguished according to the invention in that a gripping member (32) of the gripping device (25) is arranged beside the canula (10) with a space between the latter and it. The puncturing behaviour of the catheterisation set is thus improved because the user can support himself with his puncturing hand in the immediate vicinity of the point of puncture.

A catheterization set for placing a catheter in 
a blood vessel, comprising 


a puncture needle (10) provided with a needle 
hub (16), 
a catheter (13) surrounding the puncture needle 
(10) and having a catheter hub (41) arranged 

thereon, and 
a grip device (25) provided on the needle hub 
(16) and comprising an arm (26) which, starting 

from the needle hub (16), extends in parallel 
along the puncture needle (10) and comprises a 

grip portion (32) arranged in spaced relationship 
beside the puncture needle (10),
characterized in
that the grip portion (32) is arranged on the 
part of the arm (26) extending beyond the catheter 

hub (41), and that a guide wire (12) is provided 
to be axially displaceable in the lumen of 

the puncture needle (10). 
The catheterization set according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the grip portion (32) 

comprises two grip plates (30,31) arranged in 
parallel to each other, the planes of said grip 

plates (30,31) extending transversely to the 
longitudinal axis of the set. 
A puncture instrument, comprising a steel needle 
(10) carrying on one end thereof a hub (16) comprising 

a grip device (25) with a grip portion 
(32), the grip portion (32) being arranged in 

spaced relationship beside the steel needle (10) 
on an arm (26) starting from the hub (16) and 

extending in parallel along the steel needle 
(10),
characterized in
 
that the grip portion (32) comprises two grip 

plates (30,31) arranged in parallel to each other, 
the planes of said grip plates (30,31) extending 

transversely to the longitudinal axis of 
the steel needle (10).
