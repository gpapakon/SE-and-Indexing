<ABSTRACT>
A coarse MgCl2, and optionally titanium tetrachloride, powder is introduced into a plasma torch and a powder with a very fine particle size is recovered after cooling. The process applies particularly to MgCl2 covered with titanium tetrachloride. It is additionally possible to cover the very fine powder with an electron donor during cooling.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of magnesium chloride powder,
characterised in that it essentially consists of feeding

coarse magnesium chloride powder into a plasma torch and
recuperating a powder with a very fine granulometry after

cooling.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that
magnesium chloride and titanium tetrachloride are fed into

the plasma torch.
Process according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterised
in that the powder with a very fine granulometry is coated

with an electron donor during cooling.
Powder with a very fine granulometry which can be obtained
by the process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3.
