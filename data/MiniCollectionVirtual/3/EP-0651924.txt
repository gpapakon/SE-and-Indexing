<ABSTRACT>
Method for the cellization and decellization of a binary data flow including informative structures known as tributary units or TUs, and in particular TU-32, TU-21 and TU-12. Starting from an informative flow set up like an STM-1 frame (corresponding so to the international specifications and norms), through an adaptation operation (Higher Order Path Adaptation), the data flow is structured in an origin byte frame OF (Origin Frame), typically inside a switching node. This frame is cellizised and, after the processing of the information, it is reorganized in a destination byte frame DF (Destination Frame), and from this frame a STM-1 structure is obtained again, which will be transmitted to the following switching node without further elaboration at TU level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method which allows 
to transform an informative flow set up in a frame 
structure of bytes into a frame structure of cells 
(cellization), and starting from the frame structure 
realized in this way to provide in output a new frame 
structure of bytes (decellization). The invention can be used in digital telecommunication 
networks, and in particular in telecommunication systems 
including integrated digital networks in broadband type 
services (or high bit rate) briefly indicated as B-ISDN. More in particular the invention concerns optic 
transmission systems of synchronous digital hierarchy or 
SDH, which will be used in the evolution from the actual 
telecommunication systems to those suitable to supply 
broadband services (B-ISDN). For the B-ISDN services the use of the transfer and 
switching system ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) has been 
specified where the informative flows are subdivided in 
information blocks of limited amplitude, each of these is 
carried by a packet or cell of 53 bytes of which 48 are 
assigned to the information transfer and 5 identify the 
informative flow to which the cell belongs. Typically a switching node is a fast packet switch 
which values the header of each received ATM cell and based 
on this it routes the cell towards the appropriate ATM flow 
in output. In order to overcome certain problems of the actual 
digital telecommunication networks, which provide for a 
data transmission of the plesiochronous type, ITU-T, 
particularly in recommendations G707, G708 and G709, has  
 
recently proposed a synchronous digital transmission 
technique called SDH. The SDH technique is based on 
synchronous transfer modules (STM) where the synchronous 
transfer module is understood to be an informative 
structure suitable to support the connections at section 
level in the SDH system. The STM includes header section 
fields (SOH) and payloads set up in a block structure which 
is repeated every 125 µs. The basic module is defined at a transmission speed or 
bit rate of 155.520 Mbit/s and is called STM-1. As 
illustrated in Figure 2A the frame structure of the module 
or the basic level STM-1 is set up by a matrix of 9 rows 
and 270 columns and its elements consist of bytes, each one 
set up by 8 bits, which develops row by row, from the left 
to the right and from top to bottom. The first 9 columns of 
the frame include the section header fields (SOH), 
dedicated for example to the frame alignment, the error 
monitoring and auxiliary data
