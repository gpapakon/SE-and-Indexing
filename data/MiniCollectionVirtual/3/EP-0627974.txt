<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process for manufacturing a tool handle (1), in particular for a screwdriver. The handle comprises a core (2) of hard plastic with a seamless crowned endpiece (5) opposite the blade and a jacket (3) of soft plastic which surrounds the core but not the endpiece. The surface of the jacket has at least one depression moulded into it, in particular a hollow (8, 10) to facilitate gripping. The tool handle is produced in two stages. In the first stage, the handle core is moulded in a mould (13) with a mould core (14), which is arranged in the first mould and is provided with the seamless recess (15) for the crowned endpiece (5). In the second stage, soft plastic is injected around the mould core (14) in a mould (16), the crowned endpiece being kept sealed off in an appropriate recess (16e, f).

Process for the production of a tool handle (1), more 
particularly for a srewdriver, which has a hard plastics 

handle core (2) produced in a first divided mould (13) and 
a crowned end member (5) remote from the blade, and a soft 

plastics jacketing (3) which encloses the handle core (2) 
without the end member (5) and whose surface is formed with 

at least one depression, such as a handle recess (8,10), 
characterized in 


that in the production of the handle core (2) the crowned 
end member (5) is moulded by means of a mould core (14) 

which is disposed in the first mould (13) and whose end 
face is formed with a seamless recess (15), 
and that thereafter the handle core (2) is injected 
around with the soft plastics of the envelope (3), under 

an axial pressure directed towards a concave recess 
(16e,f) adapted to the end member (5) in a second axially 

longitudinally divided mould (16), the crowned end member 
(5), disposed flush in said recess (16e,f), being sealed 

off from the soft plastics, and the hard plastics of the 
handle core (2) being connected by self-substance to the 

soft plastics of the jacketing (3) as it is being 
injected around. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the maximum diameter (D) of the crowned end member (5) is 

larger by a small overdimension than the corresponding 
diameter (d) of the concave recess (16e,f) of the second 

mould (16). 
A process according to claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that during the moulding of the end member (5) its edge 

zone (5c) is flattened frustoconically.  
 
A process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the concave recess (16e,f) of the second 

mould (16) for receiving the end member (5) of the handle core 
(2) is formed seamlessly in the end face of a mould core. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the mould core (14) is axially displaceable 

in the first and/or the second mould (13). 
A tool for the performance of the process according to one of 

the preceding claims, having a longitudinally divided mould 
member whose symmetrical mould halves (105, 106) have recesses 

(109) associated with one another which, when the mould member is 
joined together, form a hollow mould for the plastics injected 

into the mould, characterized in that the mould halves (105, 106) 
are constructed on displaceable jaws (107, 108) which can be 

inserted together into the receiving portion (101) of a holder 
(100) whose boundary wall (101a) associated with the end of the 

mould halves (105, 106) has a recess (102) in which a mould 
member (103) is releasably disposed whose end face (103a) is 

formed with a seamless recess (103b) for the end member of the 
core. 
A tool according to claim 6, characterized in that during 
withdrawal and insertion the jaws (107, 108) are guided by guides 

(104) disposed on the holder (100).  
 
A tool according to claims 6 or 7, characterized in that the 
jaws (107, 108) can be displaced by means of a common pulling 

device (110). 
A tool handle (1) for a screwdriver which has a hard plastics 
handle core (2) injected around the screwdriver blade (4) and 

having a crowned end member (5) remote from the blade, and a soft 
plastics jacketing (3) which encloses the handle core (2) without 

the end member (5) and whose surface is formed with at least one 
depression, such as a handle recess (8, 10), characterized in 

that the crowned end member (5) of the handle core (2) is 
injected seamlessly at its end face (14a), and the handle core 

(2) with the jacketing (3) is injected around with soft plastics 
and is connected by self-substance to the jacketing (3).
