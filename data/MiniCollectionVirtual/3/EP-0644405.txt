<ABSTRACT>
To increase the measurement accuracy, in particular of an improved switch-off accuracy in the case of small metering quantities in the gravimetric metering of bulk materials, a method is proposed in which the detection of weight is carried out continuously on the sector (18) located in the discharge position (A) and, by means of forming the difference between these successive weight values, the mass of the bulk goods which has intermediately been discharged at the discharge position (A) is determined. Furthermore, a device is proposed in which the delivery device (26) is coupled to a force measuring device (305) for recording the forces acting on the delivery device (26).

Method of gravimetric metering of bulk material, which is
delivered at a charge position (B) to a measuring disk (19)

and is scraped off at a discharge position (A) oppositely
offset thereto (B) by a discharge device (26), wherein the

measuring disk (19) is divided into sectors (18) whose
current weight together with that of the bulk material

disposed on the current sector (18) is detected and the
discharge device (26) in the discharge position (A) covers

at least one sector (18),

characterized in that

the weight determination is effected continuously at the
sector (18) located at the discharge position (A) and the

mass of the bulk material delivered at the discharge
position (A) in the meantime is determined by difference

formation from these sequential weight determinations.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
switching between sequential sectors (18) is effected

periodically after a respective predetermined interval of
time.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
switching between sequential sectors (18) is effected after

a predetermined angle of rotation.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the determined mass delivered at the discharge

position (A) is converted into a metered flow.
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that the
computed instantaneous metered flow is employed to regulate

the speed of rotation of the measuring disk (19) or the
speed of rotation 
of a charge member (25).
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the determined mass delivered at the discharge 

position (A) is accumulated and the measuring disk (19)
and/or the charge member (25) is stopped after attaining a

set-point value.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that a tare weighing of the sector (18) in a position

after the discharge position (A) is effected in order to
give additional control over the delivered mass, and a

brutto weight value is determined before the discharge
position (A) and the nett mass formed therefrom is compared

with the determined value for the mass delivered at the
discharge position (A).
Apparatus for gravimetric metering of bulk material, with a
measuring disk (19), a charge member (25), a discharge

device (26) offset opposite the charge member (25) and at
least one force measuring device (20) with which the weight

of the material currently conveyed on the measuring disk
(19) between the charge member (25) and the discharge

device (26) is determined, wherein the measuring disk (19)
is provided with at least three sectors (18) movable

slightly vertically independently of each other and
decoupled from each other in weighing technology terms, and

the force measuring device (20) is arranged below the
sectors (18) and detects the weight of the material located

on each sector (18), wherein each sector (18) has a force
measuring device (20) associated thereto,

characterized in that

a processing circuit (230) is provided to determine therein
the mass of the bulk material, delivered in the meantime at

the discharge position (A), by difference formation from
the weight values sequentially determined by the force

measuring device (20) associated to the sector (18) located
at the discharge position (A), and the discharge device

(26) is coupled to a force measuring device (305) for
detecting the forces acting on the discharge device (26). 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterized in that the
discharge device (26) is formed as a discharge auger (327).
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterized in that the
discharge device (26) is formed as a scraper strip (306).

scraper strip (306) is provided with a pressure bar (308)

facing the measuring disk (18).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 8 to 11,
characterized in that the discharge device (26) effects

delivery outwardly.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 8 to 11,
characterized in that the discharge device (26) effects

delivery inwardly, the measuring disk (19) being annular
with a central discharge position (A).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 8 to 13,
characterized in that the discharge device (26) discharges

on both sides, radially inwardly and outwardly.
