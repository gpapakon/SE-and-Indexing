<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for ablating selected surfaces of an elastomeric 
product or an attached work piece. A tire is positioned beneath a laser system 

such that a laser beam is cast upon the tire sidewall or applied work piece. A 
microprocessor controls the directing of the laser beam and the position of the 

tire with respect thereto such that various informational and/or decorative designs 
and configurations may be ablated into the surface impinged by the laser beam. 

The dwell time of the laser beam upon the surface and other factors control the 
depth of ablation. In certain embodiments of the invention, a multi layered work 

piece is employed such that the depth of ablation will correlate to contrasting or 

complimentary colors or will effect a desired relief appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention herein resides in the art of the manufacture of elastomeric
products, such as pneumatic tires and the like. Particularly, the invention relates
to the generation of decorative and/or informational designs and configurations
in an elastomeric product. Specifically, the invention provides for the use of a
laser to ablate elastomeric materials to generate such decorative and/or
informational designs in a substrate of the product.It has previously been known to provide pneumatic tires with decorative
sidewalls in various configurations. Raised letters or logos molded onto the
sidewall of the tire have been commonplace. Additionally, for years it has been
known to provide a decorative band about the sidewall of the tire and concentric
with the axis thereof to provide "whitewall" tires. Such bands have often been
provided by imbedding a laminate having a white elastomeric face within the
sidewall of the tire which is later ground and buffed to expose the same.
However, such a process is expensive and time consuming.It has also been known in the art to bond a decorative applique to the tire
sidewall. In some instances, the applique has been of an uncured or partially
cured nature, applied to the tire within the tire mold and vulcanized thereto
during the curing process. It is further known to provide such appliques in a
cured state for subsequent adhesive attachment to the tire. While such processes
have generally been acceptable from the standpoint of cost effectiveness and
maintenance of tire integrity, improvements in the realm of processability,
configuration resolution, and design availability are still needed. Indeed, the
range of decorative features that may be added to the tires by means of molding
or appliques has been quite restricted.It has further been known in the art to provide informational material
upon a tire by means of molding, the adherence of appliques, branding, or the 
like. Such informational material has included serial numbers, manufacturer's
codes, and indicia of ownership. Again, the apparatus and technique employed
for imparting such information to the tire have generally been time consuming
and costly in implementation. This is particularly true when the information is
unique to each tire, requiring serial number or code changes from tire to tire
during the manufacturing process.In general, the prior art has taught that any alteration of a pneumatic tire
beyond that of a simple "black wall" tire is a costly proposition and subject to
limitations of the availability
