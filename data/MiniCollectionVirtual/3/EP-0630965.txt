<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are concentrated alkaline liquid detergent compositions suitable 
for dilution with hard or de-ionized water. The compositions can be stored before 

and after dilution for prolonged periods at temperatures ranging from about 40°F 
(4°C) to about 100°F (38°C) without precipitates forming. The compositions 

contain a maleic acid-olefin copolymer, a detergent surfactant, a solvent/buffer 
system comprising beta-aminoalkanol and/or monoethanolamine, and less than 

about 85% water. The copolymer acts as a crystallization inhibitor and is uniquely 
soluble in the concentrated liquid detergent compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to concentrated liquid detergent compositions for 
use in cleaning hard surfaces. Such compositions can be diluted with tap water 
and stored in a ready-to-use form for extended periods without solids forming. Concentrated liquid hard surface cleaners which are suitable for dilution 
with tap water have advantages over ready-to-use hard surface cleaners. Dilutable 
concentrates are typically less expensive to manufacture and ship, require less 
storage space prior to dilution and impose a lower burden on landfill operations 
since less packaging is involved. Development of such dilutable liquid concentrates presents unique 
problems. First, they should contain a sequestering agent or crystallization 
inhibitor that will help prevent precipitation of insoluble salts of polyvalent metal 
cations present in hard water diluents. At the typically basic pH of concentrated 
hard surface cleaners, the polyvalent metal cations react with carbonates and other 
anionic species in the tap water and precipitate. Sequestering agents, however, 
tend to promote spotting/filming on the surfaces being cleaned. Accordingly, it 
has been difficult to formulate a dilutable concentrated liquid hard surface cleaner 
that contains sufficient sequestering agents but does not promote excessive 
spotting/filming. Second, the sequestering agent should be soluble in both the liquid 
concentrate and aqueous dilutions thereof over a wide range of concentrations. 
Sequestering agents typically require carboxylate or phosphate groups to interact 
with hardness ions and are soluble in dilute aqueous solutions because of the 
interactions between water and the highly-charged sequestering moieties in these 
molecules. However, concentrated dilutable cleaning solutions that contain high 
levels of non-aqueous cleaning solvents pose a problem in getting adequate 
solubility of the sequestering agents. Sequestrants are typically much less soluble  
 
because they do not effectively interact with the solvents to maintain solubility. 
For example, polycarboxylate sequestrants that are soluble in water are typically 
not very soluble in non-aqueous solvents because of the relatively high charge 
density in these polycarboxylate sequestrants compared to the non-aqueous 
cleaning solvents. This limits the amount of sequestrant that can be added to a 
concentrated hard surface cleaning composition. In regions where the water is 
very hard, this raises the real risk that there will be insufficient sequestrant to 
prevent
