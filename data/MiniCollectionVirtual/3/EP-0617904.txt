<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a dispensing package for pasty, stick-like products. This package, which is essentially made from synthetic material, includes a hollow body (2) inside which the pasty stick is guided in a longitudinal direction (X-X'), a device (6) for displacing the stick, consisting of a sliding piston to which the stick is secured and of a screw capable of displacing the piston, a thumb (knurled) wheel (7) for driving the screw (62) in rotation, mounted at one end (27) of the body (2) opposite a cap (5) for closing this body, and is characterised in that the body comprises, on the one hand, an internal lining (3) which defines the two longitudinal ends (825, 27) of the body and which is produced in an elastically deformable material compatible with the pasty product, as well as an external sleeve (4) which partially surrounds the said lining and which is assembled therewith with the aid of means formed together (in a single piece) with it (431, 433, 437). This package makes it possible, for example, to package hygiene (health) or cosmetic products, such as deodorant or, for example, lipstick.

Dispensing packing essentially from synthetic material
for a stick-shaped pasty product such for example as a

deodorant or lipstick and of the type comprising a hollow
body (2) inside of which the pasty stick is guided along

a longitudinal direction (X-X') between a retracted
position and a position of use projecting from a first

end (825) of the body, a device (6) for the displacement
of the stick constituted by a sliding piston (63) to

which the stick is made fast and by a screw (62) adapted
to co-operate with a piston for displacing it along the

said direction (X-X'), a knurled cap (7) for rotatably
driving the screw (62), mounted onto the other end or

second end (27) of the body (2) as well as a cap (5) for
the closing of the first end (825), a sealing system

being provided between the cap (5) and the body (2)
whereas the piston (63) comprises apertures (61) opening

in facing relation to both ends of the body, so that the
stick may be obtained from the second end (27) of the

body by the casting of the product through the said
apertures (61) and the solidification within the body (2)

before the mounting of the knurled drive cap (7),
characterized in that the body comprises on the one hand

an internal casing (3) which defines both longitudinal
ends (825, 27), is open at these two ends and is made

from an elastically deformable material compatible with
the pasty product and a stationary external sleeve (4)

surrounding the said casing (3) so that both ends of the
latter are axially projecting from the sleeve and on the

other hand integrated means for assembling the sleeve (4)
with the internal casing (3) and in that the closure cap

(5) and the knurled drive cap (7) are fitted over the
upper and lower projecting ends, respectively, of the

casing. 
Packing according to claim 1, characterized in that
the internal casing (3) comprises a surface of revolution

(366) made integral in one piece of material and disposed
in facing relation to the second end (27) of the body

whereas the aforesaid drive screw (62) which is inserted
into the packing through this end is caused to bear along

the said direction (X-X') and is guided for rotation upon
this surface of rev
olution (366) of the casing (3).
Packing according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the aforesaid sealing system comprises a lip (825)

which constitutes the first end of the internal casing
(3) and adapted to be caused to hermetically accommodate

itself while becoming deformed into a corresponding
groove of the cap (5) when the latter is in the position

of closing the body of the packing (1).
Packing according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the aforesaid sealing system

comprises between the first end (825) and the external
sleeve (4) at least one peripheral protusion (833, 835)

made integral in one piece of material with the internal
casing (3) as well as a corresponding surface of the cap

(5) upon which the protusion is caused to hermetically
press itself while being deformed, when the cap (5) is in

the position of closing of the body of the packing (1).
Packing according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the internal casing (3) comprises

near its first end (825), a threading (35) with which co-operates
a tapping (53) of the aforesaid cap (5) so that

at the end of screwing, i.e. in the closing position, the
latter (5) exerts upon the casing (3) a force

approximately directed towards the second end (27) of the
body (2). 
Packing according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the aforesaid assembly means

comprise on the one hand at least one device (431, 433)
for the positioning and for the holding against motion of

the casing (3) with respect to the external sleeve (4)
and on the other hand at least one device (437) for the

fastening through elastic clamping or "clipping" of the
casing (3) and of the said sleeve (4).
Packing according to one of claims 2 to 6,
characterized in that ribs (36) for the guiding of the

piston (63) and of the stick, made internal in one piece
of material with the internal casing (3) extend in

projecting relationship in nearly parallel relation to
the aforesaid longitudinal direction (X-X'), that end of

these ribs (36) which is opposite to the cap (5)
preferably constituting the aforesaid surface of

revolution (366) for the guiding in rotation of the screw
(62) of the displacement device (6).
Packing according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the external sleeve (4) of the body

is of a rigid material such as a styrenic plastic or a
metal and comprises ornamental elements such for example

as impressions, transparent parts, inlayings, reliefs or
the like.
Packing according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the stationary external sleeve (4)

has near its end opposite to the cap (5) another surface
of revolution (47) adapted to guide in rotation the

knurled drive cap (7) with respect to the body (2) of the
packing (1). 
Packing according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the internal casing (3) of the body

(2) comprises near the second end (27) at least one
peripheral sealing collar or rib adapted to hermetically

press itself while being elastically deformed upon the
inside of the knurled drive cap (7).
Packing according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the aforesaid knurled drive cap (7)

and the displacement screw (62) have dog elements (627,
762) made integral in one piece of material and in mutual

engagement so as to make the said screw (62) fast to for
rotation with the knurled drive cap (7), these elements

being preferably located near the axis of rotation (X-X')
of the said screw (62).
