Method of setting, regulating and monitoring the rate 
of feeding of a refrigerant vaporizer (3) disposed in a 

closed circuit of a refrigerator (1) and vaporizing a 
mass flow of refrigerant (4) to a substantially dry 

suction gas, in which a measuring body (11) which can be 
heated is inserted in a suction-gas duct (71) disposed 

downstream of the refrigerant vaporizer (3), the suction 
gas bathes the measuring body (11), the measuring body 

(11) is heated to a temperature exceeding the temperature 
of the suction gas, and the impact of fluid droplets of 

the refrigerant on the measuring body (11) is detected by 
measurement of the energy required to vaporize the fluid 

drops,

correspond to a dry suction gas are determined from the 

measurement signal detected and, from these measurement 
points, a basic signal is determined, which corresponds 

to the electronic noise of a measuring and evaluation 
unit (93) used for implementing the method and of the
