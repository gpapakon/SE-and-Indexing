<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric filter (1) comprises a body of dielectric 
material, having two bores (3) running therethrough acting 

as resonators. The sides of the body are covered in a 
metallic coating apart from an upper surface (2) and one 

side surface (4). Electrode patterns (5c,6) are provided on the 
uncoated side surface to provide inductive and capacitive 

coupling between the resonators. By providing switches 8, 
the ratio of inductive to capacitive coupling can be changed 

thus allowing the filter to act as a bandstop or bandpass 
filter depending upon whether the switches are open or 

closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter for selectively 
attenuating or passing a range of radio frequency signals 
comprising at least two mutually coupled resonators. As is well known to persons skilled in the art, filters 
having the desired properties can be realised by the 
appropriate interconnection of a number of resonators. The 
resonators are in the form of a transmission line resonator 
corresponding to the parallel connection of an inductance 
and a capacitance. It is also well known in the art in high 
frequency technology to use different types of resonators 
for different applications according to the conditions and 
the desired properties. Known resonator types include 
dielectric, helical, strip line and air-insulated rod 
resonators each having a relevant range of uses. For 
example, dielectric resonators and filters constructed 
therefrom are commonly used in high frequency technology and 
are useful in a number of applications because of their 
small size and weight, stability and power resistance. For 
instance, a dielectric filter, for use in a duplex filter, 
can be constructed from separate ceramic blocks or from one 
block provided with a number of resonators in which the 
coupling therebetween is accomplished electromagnetically 
within the ceramic material. A dielectric stop filter is 
usually composed of separate blocks, with coupling between 
the resonators via the dielectric material being prevented 
completely. A filter described above and used in the first 
end of the duplex filter may equally be constructed from 
helical, strip line or coaxial resonators. All of these are 
filter designs well known to a person skilled in the art, 
and therefore, they are not described herein any further 
detail.  Generally speaking a filter is an electrical circuit which 
passes certain frequencies and stops (or attenuates) other 
frequencies. For instance in telecommunications technology 
use filters which pass a desired range of frequencies while 
attenuating other frequencies -known as a bandpass filter- 
and filters which attenuate a desired range of frequencies 
while passing other frequencies -known as a bandstop filter- 
are commonly used. It is known to persons skilled in the art to have a coupling 
between the resonators which is purely inductive or 
capacitive or a combination of these. The inductive coupling 
is generally made closer to the grounded (bottom) end of the 
resonator where the current is higher, whereas the current 
is substantially zero at the open circuit
