<ABSTRACT>
The method and the device for detecting flaws in 
materials and their connections comprise the radiation of 

ultrasonic rays and the reception of that energy after 
its reflection from the examined product, wherein the 

component which creates, radiates and receives the 
ultrasonic energy is comprised of a number of 

interconnected sub-plates (21). 
One version of the device for detecting flaws in 
materials and their connections comprises two separate 

converters (2,3), each with its own cover and both connected 
into one unit by means of a holder and bridges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention belongs to the area of NDT defectoscopy, particularly the sphere 
of ultrasonic flaw detection and the various devices using such methods. A great deal of importance has been attached to resolving problems of quality 
and reliability in the manufacture of various materials, for example steel, and 
particularly the connection or seams between them, formed by welding, 
soldering or any other method. There are many well-known methods and 
devices available for controlling the quality of connections between metals. The 
discovery of faults in structures and machines is highly important; however, 
existing probes/detectors are frequently inaccurate, particularly when testing 
"Austenite" type steel, which is comprised of relatively large granules. The 
sensitivity of these devices is particularly low with regard to faults in 
"Austenite" type steel, and the need to improve these tests has become more 
acute in view of the accidents which have occurred in nuclear reactors. One of these devices is described in U.S.S.R. Inventors Certificate No. 
962806. This flaw detector is based on two ultrasonic vibration converters 
located in a single box, wherein one converter includes a panel which radiates 
focused energy and the other converter includes an identical panel which 
receives the ultrasonic radiation reflected frown the product being tested. 
The converter panels used for the radiation and reception of focused ultrasonic 
radiation are made of a piezoelectric material. The echo method enables 
external and hidden flaws to be revealed in complete and semi-complete 
products of various sizes and shapes, flaws which cannot be discovered by 
other means.  During the test, the device moves over the surface of the material being tested, 
so that the focused energy is penetrated into the mostly metal product. This 
device radiates focused energy into the product in the form of a series of 
ultrasonic impulses (short pulses separated by a relatively long interval). 
Reflected energy is returned to the device from the metal granules, for 
example, of the Austenite type, which are relatively large. As stated above, 
the sensitivity of the known detectors for Austenite type metal is very low, 
while the new device is far more sensitive and capable of discerning flaws 
which cannot be identified by means of current devices. If the process is 
completed within a reasonable period of time and in a regular fashion, then the 
metals and the seams between them may be considered normal. However, if 
any change
