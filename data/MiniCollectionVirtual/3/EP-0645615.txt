<ABSTRACT>
A photoelectric method for sedimentational analysis of homogeneous dispersed systems consists in passing a ray beam of an arbitrary form first through a non-charged cell and measuring the initial value of photocurrent generated by the non-dispersed beam passed through the non-charged cell. The distance h is determined between two mutually most distant points of projection of two light spots, produced on the walls of the non-charged cell, on a plane parallel to the direction of sedimentation. The value of relative methodological error (delta) having been evaluated, the value H is then determined. The ray beam is oriented so that the middle of the distance h is situated at the depth H from the surface of the suspension. The cell is charged with suspension and the lapse of time (tau) is measured during which the optical density of the suspension of the dispersed powder particles rests constant from the moment of beginning of sedimentation, and the relative optical density D(t) of the suspension is measured. On the basis of Stokes formula the radius rmax of the largest particles of powder is determined. After that, depending on the speed of change of the relative optical density VD at t 
>
 (tau), the following are determined: the density (gamma)(r) of distribution of the powder particles as a function of the radius, the density (my)(r) of distribution of the powder particles, the average value

r

 of the radius, the average value

 of the square of the radius and the standard deviation (Delta). In order to accelerate the sedimentation analysis the ray beam is scanned by directing it initially closer to the bottom of the cell by a value of (Delta)H. Converging, diverging or parallel ray beams are used within the wave length range of 0.6-0.06 microns.
