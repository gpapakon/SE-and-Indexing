<ABSTRACT>
In a multiple computer system, a common visual image is 
displayed on all computers. Each computer stores context 

parameters for controlling the appearance of images displayed 
by the computer. The graphics calls used to generate the 

image are notified to the other computers which generate 
corresponding images using the notified graphics calls and the 

stored context parameters. If the context parameters utilized 
in generating the image are changed, such changes are notified 

to the other computers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to operating a plurality of 
computers. Modern telephone systems allow multiple parties at 
different locations to hold a conference. However, telephone 
conferences do not provide all of the conveniences of a face-to-face 
conference, where participants all meet at a common table 
in a meeting room. For example, in a meeting room, 
participants can view an object of interest, such as a drawing or 
a product. Such viewing is not possible in a telephone 
conference. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method 
for operating a plurality of interlinked computers, wherein 
images may be replicated on the computers by an efficient 
operating procedure. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of operating a plurality of interlinked 
computers, including the step of storing, in all of said 
computers, context parameters which control the appearance of 
images drawn on said computers, characterized by the steps of: 
changing at least one of the context parameters stored in said 
first computer; and transmitting any changed context parameters 
to said second computer to effect corresponding changes in the 
context parameters stored in said second computer.  One embodiment of the present invention will now be 
described by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 illustrates three computers, connected by 
telephone lines. Figure 2 initiates an example, which will be elaborated in 
Figures 3-14. In the example, a calculator program is operated, 
and annotated, by various parties. Figure 3 illustrates how the system responds when a host user 
attempts to operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 4 illustrates how the system responds when a host 
user attempts to annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 5 illustrates how the system responds when a host 
user attempts to operate the calculator, in Application mode.  Figure 6 illustrates how the system responds when a host 
user attempts to operate the calculator, in Local Annotation 
mode.  Figure 7 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
annotate the calculator, in Local Annotation mode. Figure 8 illustrates how the system responds to a host user when in View 
mode. Figure 9 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user attempts 
to operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 10 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user 
attempts to annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode.

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a plurality of interlinked 
computers, including the step of storing, in all of said 

computers, context parameters which control the appearance of 
images drawn on said computers, characterized by the steps of: 

changing at least one of the context parameters stored in said 
first computer; and transmitting any changed context parameters 

to said second computer to effect corresponding changes in the 
context parameters stored in said second computer. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized by the 
steps of: drawing an image on said first computer using graphics 

calls and the context parameters stored in said first computer; 
and replicating said image on 
said second computer using 
similar graphics calls and the context parameters stored in said 

second computer. 
A method according to claim 2, characterized by the 
steps of intercepting graphics calls generated at said first 

computer and causing the intercepted graphics calls to be 
replicated at said second computer. 
A method according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterized in that said step of transmitting any changed 

context parameters is delayed until said first computer issues a 
graphics call which uses the changed context parameters. 
A computer system including a plurality of interlinked 
computers adapted to operate in accordance with a method 

according to any one of the preceding claims.
