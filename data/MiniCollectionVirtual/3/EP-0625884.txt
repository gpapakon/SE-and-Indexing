<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to thermodilution
catheters of the type that have an electric resistance-type
heating element for applying heat to a patient's blood for
purposes of measuring a physiological condition, such as
volumetric blood flow. More specifically, the invention
relates to systems and methods for maintaining the surface
temperature of such a heating element at a level which will
not be harmful to a patient.Catheters have long been used for applying therapeutic
or diagnostic preparations directly into the blood stream
of animals or humans. Catheters are also commonly used to
measure such parameters as cardiac output, blood pressure,
blood volume, blood components and the like.Numerous techniques have been disclosed in the prior art
for measuring blood flow using catheters. One such
technique, termed indicator dilution, relies on the
introduction of a marker into the bloodstream, the theory
being that the marker will dissipate at a rate which is a
function of blood flow as measured in units of volume per
unit of time.The present inventors believe, clinically, that heat is
the preferred marker for such an indicator dilution system. 
Unlike other indicators, heat is conserved in the immediate
vascular system, but is largely dissipated in the periphery
in one circulation time so as to eliminate recirculation
and accumulation problems. Cold (negative heat) is an
indicator which can also be used very effectively in a
clinical setting. Large amounts of cold may be used, for
cold has relatively no deleterious effects on blood and
surrounding tissues. However, a disadvantage of cold as an
indicator is that it must be supplied in a chilled fluid
carrier such as saline, because cold producing transducers
are not commercially available. Cold-based indicator
systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,819,655 to
Webler and in U.S. Patent No. 4,941,475 to Williams. Both
of those systems have significant clinical limitations in
that the circulating fluid must be cooled to near ice
temperature prior to input into the catheter and
temperature equilibrium must be established, which takes a
significant amount of time. In addition, the enlarged
catheter segment which is necessary for containing the
cooling elements may restrict blood flow.A disadvantage of heat as an indicator is that even
small increases in heat transducer temperature can have a
deleterious effect on blood and local tissue. In fact, it
can be inferred from the teachings of Ham et al. in
"Studies in Destruction of Red Blood Cells, Chapter
