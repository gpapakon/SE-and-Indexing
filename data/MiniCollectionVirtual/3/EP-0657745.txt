<ABSTRACT>
The measurement circuit includes individual interfaces each respectively connected to the energy terminals of a different cell and each including a single-wire measurement output (M) for a current measurement signal intended to be sent to a common transducer (5) via a common single-wire link. The interfaces each incorporate a switchable measurement current generator (4); they are linked in series to each other by successive elements of a single-wire link (L) making it possible for individual switching control pulses, grouped into a train for the current generators, to be transmitted serially.

Measurement circuit for a modular system of cells (1) electrically connected in
series and each constituted by one or more electrical energy producing,

accumulating or converting elements, such as electric accumulator battery
elements, said circuit comprising individual measurement interfaces (3) each

respectively connected to the power terminals ("+" and "-") of a different cell
and each including a single-wire measurement output (M) for a current

measurement signal to be transmitted to a common transducer (5) to which the
respective measurement outputs of the interfaces are connected in common via a

first common single-wire connection in the measurement circuit in question, each
interface incorporating at least a first current generator (4) for generating a

current measurement signal relating to a change in characteristic of the
corresponding cell, and a control circuit (17) for responding to one of the control

pulses, which are transmitted in series in the context of a stream by means of a
second single-wire connection (L) in order to switch each of the interface

measuring current generators (4) on in succession, 
characterized in that
 the
control circuit (17) of each interface is adapted to respond to the first command

pulse of a stream that the interface receives from a second single-wire
connection element via a first input (E) and to transmit any subsequent pulse of

the same stream to any interface on its downstream side whose first input (E) is
then connected to its own output (S) via another of the successive elements

constituting the second single-wire connection (L).
Measurement circuit according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 each individual
interface (3) incorporates an input circuit (9) including a direct current

component blocking capacitor (11) for receiving the pulses of said command
stream and an interface control circuit (17) connected to the output of the input

circuit of the interface and to the control input of the first current generator (4) of
the interface in question in order to turn on said first current generator on

receiving a first command pulse and to transmit to any connection element (L) on
its downstream side any pulses which may follow said first pulse in the same

command stream.
Measurement circuit according to claim 2 
characterized in that
 each individual
interface associated with a cell is also connected to a terminal of a common

compensator (7) by means of a second individual current generator (6) in the
interface turned on with the first current generator (29) of the interface and 

connected between said common compensator terminal and an energy terminal
(-) of the cell with which the interface is associated to balance at the various cells

all (2) energy samplings initiated by a command pulse stream.
Measurement circuit according to claim 3 
characterized in that
 each individual
interface includes an additional current generator (4") for converting into the

form of a current a second change in characteristic of the cell to which the
interface in question is assigned, said current generator being connected by its

output (H) to the common transducer (5) in parallel with the first current
generator (4) of the interface and switched alternately therewith during the

stream containing the command pulse of said first generator.
