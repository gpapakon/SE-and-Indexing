<ABSTRACT>
A window wall (10) for shielded enclosures is provided 
for use in a large opening in a shielded enclosure (12), 

that preserves the shielding integrity of the shielded 
enclosure (12) and that is easy to install. The window 

wall (10) includes a frame (14) having a frame perimeter 
(40) received within a shielded enclosure window opening 

(16) in electrical conductive engagement with the 
shielded enclosure (12). The frame (14) includes a 

number of horizontal muntins (18) and vertical mullions 
(20) defining a plurality of window openings (22). A 

window unit frame (52) is received in each window opening 
(22) supported by and electrically connected to the frame 

(14). A pair of spaced apart radio frequency shielding 
continuous screens (30,32) spans each window opening (22) 

and is supported by the window unit frame (52). Each 
screen (30,32) is formed of electrically conductive mesh 

material and is mechanically and electrically connected 
with the window unit frame (52), thereby providing 

continuous electrical contact with the shielded enclosure 
(12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electromagnetic 
interference (EMI) shielding and more particularly 
to a window wall for a shielded enclosure. Shielded enclosures are used to attenuate interference 
from electromagnetic radiation, such as radio 
frequency radiation. Such enclosures may include a single 
shield of electrically conductive metal or multiple 
shields of electrically conductive metal and/or metal 
mesh entirely enclosing a shielded space. Where apertures 
are required in the shield for windows, doors, 
ventilation, power feedthrus and the like, it is important 
to maintain the integrity of the shielding. Typical windows for shielded enclosures used 
in the past have included metallized glass or one or two 
fine wire mesh screens electrically connected to the 
shield or shields of the enclosure. One difficulty with 
screen windows is that they are not optically 
transparent. Even with extremely fine wire screens, 
visibility through the window is impaired. When two 
screens are employed, typically visual interference 
occurs in waves or patterns caused by a moire effect. 
U.S. patent 5,012,041, issued April 30, 1991, and 
assigned to the present assignee, discloses a screened 
window including two wire screens having different mesh  
 
patterns arranged for substantially avoiding 
conventional optical interference. While the screened window disclosed by the 
above-identified patent provides substantial improvements 
over the prior art arrangements, it is desirable 
to provide an improved window for larger openings or a 
window wall for a shielded enclosure that is easy to install 
and that effectively preserves the shielding integrity 
of the shielded enclosure. Among the objects of the present invention are 
to provide a window wall for shielded enclosures that is 
adapted for use in a large opening in the shielded enclosure, 
for example, to provide a curtain wall for the 
shielded enclosure and that preserves the shielding integrity 
of the shielded enclosure, to provide a window 
wall that is easy to install and to provide an improved 
window wall for shielded enclosures overcoming disadvantages 
of those used in the past. In brief, in accordance with the present invention, 
there is provided a window wall for a shielded 
enclosure including a frame having a frame perimeter received 
within a shielded enclosure window opening in 
electrical conductive engagement with the shielded enclosure. 
The frame includes a selected number of 
horizontal muntins and vertical mullions defining a

A window wall (10) for use in a window opening (16) in a 
shielded enclosure (12) comprising: 


a frame (14) having a frame perimeter (40) for being received 
within said shielded enclosure window opening (16) in electrically 

conductive engagement with the shielded enclosure (12); 
said frame (14) including a selected number of both horizontal 
muntins (18) and vertical mullions (20) defining a plurality of clear 

window openings (22); 
said frame perimeter (40) and both said horizontal muntins (18) 
and vertical mullions (20) including at least one support member 

(40,100,102) formed of electrically conductive material; 
a window unit frame (52) received in each clear window opening 
(22), said window unit frame (52) being supported by and electrically 

connected to said frame (14); 
a pair of spaced apart radio frequency shielding continuous 
screens (30,32) spanning each said clear window opening, each screen 

(30,32) being formed of electrically conductive mesh material and being 
supported by and electrically connected with said window unit frame 

(52), thereby providing continuous electrical contact with the shielded 
enclosure (12); and 
a pair of spaced apart, light-transmitting window panes (26,28) 
supported by said window unit frame (52). 
A window wall (10) as recited in claim 1, wherein said frame 
perimeter (40) and both said horizontal muntins (18) and vertical mullions 

(20) further include a clamping member (46) and a plurality of fasteners 
(48,110) mounting said clamping member (46) to said at least one 

support member (40,100,102) and said clamping member (46) holding 
said window unit frame (52) in electrically conductive engagement with 

said support member (40,100,102). 
A window wall (10) as recited in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein both 
said horizontal muntins (18) and vertical mullions (20) include a pair of
