<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a lock for people which is constructed in the manner of conventional turnstile lock arrangements and has a delimiting means, in the form of a segment of an arc of a circle, on one side of a through-passage and a blocking element which can rotate about a vertical spindle arranged in the centre of said delimiting means, a shutter-door element, instead of a fixedly installed blocking screen, passes as far as the revolving-door spindle, which shutter-door element can be pivoted between an open position, which releases a through-passageway beside the revolving door, and a closed position, which blocks off said through-passageway.

Entry lock for persons with a circular arc segment limitation on one side of a
passage, the open side of which faces towards the other side of the passage and extends

over a predetermined peripheral angle, with a revolving door which is borne to be rotatable
about a vertical axle arranged in about the centre of the limitation and which is provided

with wings which extend forth from the rotational axle whilst including preferably equal
angles one to the other and are of grating rods arranged one above the other at a spacing

and with a barrier comb which extends substantially between the rotational axle of the
revolving door and the other side of the passage and is of grating rods which permit the

unhindered rotatability of the door and are arranged one above the other at a spacing and
displaced relative to the grating rods of the revolving door wings, characterised thereby,

that the barrier comb is constructed as a gate element (16, 26, 36, 36'), which is movable
between a closed position, in which the entry lock for persons is passable only on

actuation of the revolving door (13, 33, 33'), and an open setting freeing a passage path
enabling a completely free passage of persons and/or transport of loads.
Entry lock for persons according to claim 1, characterised by the pivotable
articulation of the gate element (16, 26, 36, 36') about a vertical axle (17, 27, 35, 35
').
Entry lock for persons according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that the
circular arc segment limitation (12, 32, 32') reaches across a peripheral angle of at most

180Â° and that the wings of the revolving door (13, 33, 33') extend forth from the revolving
door axle (15, 35, 35') on mutually opposite sides.
Entry lock for persons according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that the
revolving door (23) is constructed as turnstile with at least three wings (24, 24', 24") and

comprises at least one wing (24'), which is pivotable in direction towards a neighbouring
wing (14, 14') about an axle parallel to the revolving door axle (25).
Entry lock for persons according to one of the claims 2 to 4, characterised by the
pivotable articulation of the gate element at or in the region of the revolving door axle (35,

35'). 
Entry lock for persons according to one of the claims 2 to 5, characterised by the
pivotable articulation of the gate element (16, 26) by means of an articulation axle (17, 27),

which is parallel to the revolving door axle and on that side of the passage, which is
remote from the revolving door (13, 13').
Entry lock for persons according to one of the claims 2 to 5, characterised thereby,
that a respective circular arc segment limitation with a revolving door (33, 33') is arranged

on each of both sides of the passage and that gate elements (36, 36'), which each reach
to a respective revolving door axle (35, 35') as well as are articulated to be pivotable at or

in the region of that revolving door axle, extend between the revolving doors (33, 33').
Entry lock for persons according to claim 7, characterised thereby, that the gate
element consists of two gate wings (36, 36'), which are each articulated at or in the region

of a respective revolving door axle (35, 35') to be pivotable between a closed position and
an open setting, that each gate wing reaches by the end remote from its articulation axle to

the corresponding end of the respective other gate element and that both the gate wings
are latchable at least in their closed positions.
Entry lock for persons according to claim 8, characterised thereby, that the gate
wings (36, 36') comprise U-shaped frame parts, the limbs of which are each connected

together by a respective web and are borne to be pivotable by their free ends at the upper
or lower end of the associated revolving door axle (35, 35') or in the region thereof, and

that grating rods, which are arranged one above the other at a spacing and reach to close
to the respective revolving door axle, extend forth from the webs, which each extend about

parallelly to the respective revolving door axle, of the frame parts.
