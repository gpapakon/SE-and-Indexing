<ABSTRACT>
A projection display (10) for an electronic data processing device (14) 
for use in conjunction with an overhead projector (12) is provided. The 

projection display (10) includes a display with a light transmitting screen 
(30), and the screen (30) is framed by a housing (32) 

The housing (32) defines a free convection air channel below the screen (30) 
to conduct a cooling air flow. The air flow in the free convection air channel 

substantially eliminates the problem of image deterioration due to screen 
overheating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of electronic computing 
device displays. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
projection display, for example, for a calculator. Overhead projectors have long been used by educators and lecturers to 
project an illuminated and enlarged image on a screen for viewing by an 
audience. With the increasing use of computers, powerful calculators and 
other electronic computing devices as pedagogical, demonstration or 
illustration devices, there is a need to enlarge and project the computer 
and/or calculator screen display for group viewing. One attempt to achieve this capability employs a duplicate liquid 
crystal display (LCD) coupled to the calculator to generate the same data and 
configuration as displayed on the calculator display screen. This duplicate 
liquid crystal display is then positioned approximately ten inches above the 
projector document surface by the use of a stand or platform. Such a stand 
usually incorporates a magnifying lens positioned above the duplicate liquid 
crystal display to further enlarge the projected image in order to project an 
adequately large image.  Although such setups achieve the desired function, i.e., enlarge and 
project the calculator screen display, they have fatal flaws. Due to the 
internal projector condenser lens arrangement, the light emitting from the 
projector light source is more concentrated at the elevated point than at the 
document surface. The elevated duplicate liquid crystal display is thus 
subject to more concentrated energy per square inch, which translates to its 
substantial heating. Since typical liquid crystal displays have an operating 
temperature upper limit of 50 to 80Â° C, the elevated stand arrangement 
quickly causes overheating of the duplicate liquid crystal display and its 
associated electronics. As a result, the projected image darkens and yields 
progressively less contrast between the pixels on the display and the lit 
background. Frequent contrast adjustment or shutting off the projector 
therefore becomes necessary within the time span of a typical class session or 
lecture. One solution to the duplicate liquid crystal display overheating and 
darkening problem is to use a pre-shaped heat shield placed on the projector 
document surface beneath the stand to decrease the amount of light energy 
striking the duplicate liquid crystal assembly. Because the heat shield is 
usually a separate piece of cardboard with no obviously discernable function, 
it is easily
