<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a preformed prosthesis intended to replace a damaged intervertebral disc. It comprises two half-casings (9, 10) fixed rigidly onto the adjacent vertebrae and connected by a compression cushion (11) comprising a plurality of layers of materials having different compressibilities, making it possible to take up the deformations which the prosthesis undergoes. Application to orthopaedic surgery.

<CLAIMS>
Preshaped prosthesis for replacing a deteriorated intervertebral disk
without friction or sliding, comprising:


two rigid half-envelopes (9, 10) shaped like cups and each integrally
fixed to one of the two vertebrae (3, 4) adjacent to the intervertebral

disk to be replaced,
flexible means positioned between the two half-envelopes and incorporating:

a compression cushion absorbing deformations resulting from a displacement
of one of the adjacent vertebrae with respect to the other and having at

least one central layer and one outer layer (C1, C2), which are concentric
and made from materials with different rigidities, the central layer being

deformable and volume-compressible so as to elastically absorb the deformations
of the outer layer, which is deformable and only slightly volume-compressible

and
an anti-expulsion system bordering the compression cushion, to prevent any
expansion of the outer layer out of the volume defined by the two half-envelopes,

the deformations of the outer, slightly volume-compressible
layer being absorbed by the central, volume-compressible layer.
Prosthesis according to claim 1, characterized in that the materials
constituting the compression cushion are fixed to the half-envelopes by

adhesion and ribs.
Prosthesis according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it incorporates
a membrane (14) fixed to each of the half-envelopes and surrounding

the compression cushion in order to ensure the sealing thereof.
Prosthesis according to claim 1, characterized in that the anti-expulsion
system incorporates annular means (14, 17) for shaping the

compression cushion.
Prosthesis according to claim 4, characterized in that the annular
shaping means incorporate a plurality of metal rings (15) having a circular

section and a shape adapted to the contour of the compression cushion and 
which are maintained together by a lattice means (17), two of the said

metal rings (16) being crimped on the border of the two half-envelopes so
as to ensure a maximum distance between said half-envelopes.
Prosthesis according to claim 4, characterized in that the annular
shaping means incorporate a metal strip (18) having a shape adapted to the

contour of the compression cushion, two metal rings (16) with a circular
section and crimped on the border of the two half-envelopes and a lattice

means (17) connecting the strip to the rings and ensuring a maximum distance
between said half-envelopes.
Prosthesis according to claim 4, characterized in that the annular
shaping means incorporate a wire wound helically around the compression

cushion.
