<ABSTRACT>
Probe for a metal detector having at least one transmitting and receiving coil (1, 2), in which two essentially oval transmitting and receiving coils are arranged alongside each other in a housing and are partly superimposed on each other on the two inner longitudinal sides (5, 6) facing each other. The longitudinal axes of the coils extend parallel to each other and the transverse axes lie on a line, the spacing (d) between the two overlapping longitudinal sides (5, 6) of the coils is selected such that the alternating induction coefficient is a minimum. A probe of such a configuration allows the detection of metal objects even with a short time constant. Furthermore, the exact determination of the point of an object is improved, since the two coils operate like two detectors working independently of each other, the receiver signals of which as a result allow both absolute measurements and differential measurements. A pulsed metal detector having a probe of such a construction and a method for detecting metal objects and the use of such a probe are also described.

A pulsed metal detector with a sensor with at least
one transmitting and receiving coil and an electronic

circuit arrangement comprising at least one transmitting
circuit and a receiving circuit, an evaluation

circuit with an output unit and a control circuit,

characterised in that
 the sensor comprises two
essentially oval transmitting and receiving coils (1,

2, L
1
, L
2
), arranged side-by-side; the said transmitting
and receiving coils partially overlap at the

two interior longitudinal sides (5, 6) facing each
other, and form a central area (8), with the

longitudinal axes of the coils (1, 2) aligned parallel
to each other, and the transverse axes in line; with

the distance (d) between the two overlapping
longitudinal sides (5, 6) of the coils (1, 2) being

selected in such a way that the mutual induction
coefficient is minimal; and each coil (L
1

connected to a transmitting circuit (T

) and with
a receiving circuit (R
1
, R
2

(S) being connected to the transmitting and receiving

circuits; with the control circuit cyclically
switching the transmitting and receiving circuits so

that each coil per se acts as a transmitting and
receiving coil and at the same time the one coil (L
1
,
L

(L
2
, L

) is transmitting.
A pulsed metal detector according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the control circuit (S) after
switching off the power at the point in time t=0 in 

the one coil acting as a transmitting coil, by the
point in time t=t
1
 at which the power in the transmitting
coil has decayed to zero, switches the other

coil to become a receiving coil, and the evaluation
circuit (A) emits the measurement voltage signal

(U
meas
) measured during this time interval, as an
output signal to the output unit (O).
A pulsed metal detector according to claim 2,

characterised in that
 for the time t
>
t
1
 to the point
in time when the measuring signal has decayed, the

control circuit (S) switches the coil acting as a
transmitting coil until point in time t=0, to become a

receiving coil.
A pulsed metal detector according to claim 3,

characterised in that
 by comparing the signals
produced in turn by the two coils, the evaluation

circuit (A) determines an output signal for the output
unit (O).
A method for detecting metal objects in which, by
switching off a magnetic field in the object, an eddy

current is inducted and the voltage inducted by the
decay of the eddy current, is acquired, 
characterised
in that
 by using a sensor with at least one transmitting
and receiving coil, comprising two essentially

oval transmitting and receiving coils (1, 2) arranged
side-by-side, which partly overlap on the two interior

longitudinal sides (5, 6) facing each other, and form
a central area (8), wherein the longitudinal axes of

the coils (1, 2) are aligned parallel to each other
and the transverse axes are in line, and the distance

(d) between the two overlapping longitudinal sides (5, 
6) of the coils (1, 2) is selected in such a way that

the mutual induction coefficient is minimal, the coils
are cyclically switched so that each coil serves as a

separate detector with one coil, serving both as a
transmitting coil and a receiving coil, and at the

same time the one coil is active as a receiving coil
when the other coil is transmitting.
A method according to claim 5, 
characterised in that

after switching off the voltage of the one transmitting

coil at the point in time t=0, until the point
in time t=t
1
, in which the power in this coil has
dropped to zero, the other coil is operated as a

receiving coil.
A method according to claim 6, 
characterised in that

for the time t
>
t
1
 to the time in which the induced
voltage has decayed, the coil which has been acting as

the transmitting coil until the time t=0, is acting as
the receiving coil.
A method according to claim 7, 
characterised in that

from the inducted voltages measured alternately from
the coils, an output signal is determined by

comparison.
