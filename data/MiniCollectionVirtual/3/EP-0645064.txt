<ABSTRACT>
Simultaneous transmitter operation in a radio network is prevented by monitoring the signal received at the control position from the transmitter of the apparatus, this signal being delayed by the passage down land lines connecting the control position to its transmission antenna and the receiver to its control position. If a signal is received within a known time period from the time of commencement of a transmit action then it is assumed to be a signal from a remote transmitter and the operation of the local transmitter is aborted to prevent interference. The system is particuarly useful where land lines and consequent time delays are present between the control position and the transmitter and the receiver and the control position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ground transmitting and receiving
apparatus and more particularly to means for preventing simultaneous
transmission between two or more of such apparatus.UK Patent No. 2083979, in the name of the present applicant,
describes a means of blocking the operation of a second radio transmitter
when a first transmitter is occupying the frequency, the purpose being to
prevent coincident and conflicting transmissions in a simplex radio
network. The effectiveness of such an arrangement, in preventing
coincident transmissions, depends on certain variables such as the time for
the first transmitter to produce RF energy following a press-to-transmit
action, and the time for the blocking apparatus of the second receiver to
detect this energy. If the second press-to-transmit is made prior to
detection of RF resulting from the first then a conflict of both
transmissions will result. The longer these delays then the less effective
the conflict prevention system. In semi-duplex Air Traffic Control ground
installations, where a full time receiver monitors associated transmitter
operation, land lines are frequently used to transfer control and voice
signals from a remote operators site. These land lines and their associated
switching apparatus introduce relatively lengthy delays which adversely
influence the effectiveness of the apparatus of UK Patent No. 2083979.
A means of minimising the effect of any such delays would improve the
apparatus of UK Patent No. 2083979 when applied to semi-duplex radio
systems. In essence, such an arrangement may have stored, in electronic
memory, the detected time period between press-to-transmit application
and consequent response of the associated receiver. In operation, any
receiver response following a press-to-transmit action, but which occurs 
before the stored time period has expired, must be from an RF source
which has preceded that from the associated transmitter. In this case it is
beneficial to prevent, or terminate, operation of the associated transmitter,
thereby allowing the preceding radio signal to be monitored without
disruption.Accordingly, and distinguished over UK Patent No. 2083979, the
present invention provides a means of electronically determining the time
period between a press-to-transmit application and subsequent receiver
response of the equipment in which the invention is incorporated, a means
of electronically storing this time period less a proportion, say 10%, a
means of initiating the resultant time period at application of a

radio transmitting and receiving apparatus comprising:


(a) means for detecting the commencement (T0) at a control position (11) of
a transmission control switch operation (PTT) in said apparatus,
(b) means for starting a timer,
(c) means for detecting the receipt (T2) at the control position (11) of a signal
received by said receiver (4) of said apparatus,
