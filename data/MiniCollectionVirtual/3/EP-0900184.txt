<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to processes for producing one or more substituted or unsubstituted 1,6-hexanediols, e.g., 1,6-hexanediol, which comprise subjecting one or more substituted or unsubstituted alkadienes to hydrocarbonylation in the presence of a hydrocarbonylation catalyst, e.g., a metal-organophosphorus ligand complex catalyst, and a promoter and optionally free ligand to produce said one or more substituted or unsubstituted 1,6-hexanediols. The substituted and unsubstituted 1,6-hexanediols produced by the processes of this invention can undergo further reaction(s) to afford desired derivatives thereof, e.g., epsilon caprolactone. This invention also relates in part to reaction mixtures containing one or more substituted of unsubstituted 1,6-hexanediols as principal product(s) of reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to single step processes
for selectively producing one or more substituted or
unsubstituted 1,6-hexanediols.1,6-Hexanediol is a valuable intermediate which
is useful, for example, in the production of
polyesters. The processes currently used to produce
1,6-hexanediols have various disadvantages. For
example, the starting materials used to produce
1,6-hexanediols are relatively expensive. In
addition, the selectivity to 1,6-hexanediols in prior
art processes has been low. Accordingly, it would be
desirable to selectively produce 1,6-hexanediols from
a relatively inexpensive starting material and by a
process which can be employed commercially. US Patent
No. 3,947,503 discloses a process for producing
1,6-hexanediol by hydroformylation of 1,3 butadiene by
a process wherein an acetal of pent-3-en-1-al is
formed in a first hydroformylation step in the
presence of lower alkanols or alkanediols and of
rhodium catalysts, and is then converted into
1,6-hexanediol in a second hydroformylation step in
the presence of cobalt catalysts, followed by
hydrogenation.DE-A-2,517,447 discloses a process for the
manufacture of pent-4-en-1-al, by passing an
acetaldehyde-acetal in the gas phase at 350°C to 450°C
over an active-surface catalyst. 
It has been discovered that alcohols possessing
internal olefinic unsaturation can be converted to
linear diols. In particular, it has been surprisingly
discovered that penten-1-ols, e.g., 3-penten-1-ols,
can be converted to 1,6-hexanediols e.g., 1,6-hexanediol,
by employing catalysts having
hydrocarbonylation/isomerization capabilities. It has
further been discovered that high selectivities and
high normal:branched isomer ratios may result from
conducting the hydrocarbonylation in the presence of a
metal ligand complex catalyst and optionally free
ligand in which the ligand is preferably an
organophosphine ligand of high basicity and low steric
bulk and in the presence of a promoter, i.e., an
organic or inorganic compound with an ionizable
hydrogen of Pka of from 1 to 35.This invention relates to a single step process
for producing one or more substituted or unsubstituted
1,6-hexanediols which comprises reacting one or more
substituted or unsubstituted pentenals with carbon
monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a metal-ligand
complex catalyst, said catalyst comprising a
metal selected from a group 8, 9 and 10 metal
complexed with an organophosphine ligand selected from
a mono-, di-, tri- and poly-(organophosphine) ligand,
and a promoter and optionally free
