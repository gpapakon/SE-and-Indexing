<ABSTRACT>
A printing paper is provided which is neutral 
paper as the base paper comprising an ink-penetration 

retarder on a printing face to retard penetration of 
liquid ink containing a nitrogen compound, a substance 

as an internal additive of the paper to absorb ammonia 
or an ammonium ion released from the nitrogen compound 

in the ink, and a water-soluble inorganic salt in an 
amount ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 % by weight. Printing 

methods are also provided which use the above printing 
paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printing
paper, more particularly to a plain paper type of
printing paper useful both for ink-jet printing and for
electrophotographic printing without special coating on
the printing face.The present invention also relates to a method
of forming an image employing the above printing paper.The ink-jet printing system, which ejects ink
directly onto printing paper, is attracting attention
owing to low running cost, less noise, and ease of
color printing in comparison with other conventional
printing systems.In an ink-jet printing system, an aqueous ink
is employed in ink-jet printing system in view of
safety in handling, and printing characteristics. The
printing medium for ink-jet printing is required to
absorb the ink rapidly, not to cause mixing of
superposed different colors of inks, to allow the ink
spread appropriately, to allow the ink to form ink
print dots in a nearly true circle shape with sharp dot
edges at high density, and naturally to be sufficiently 
white to exhibit contrast of dots.On the other hand, in electrophotographic
printing system, the printing paper is required to have
appropriate surface electric resistance and appropriate
surface smoothness, to have satisfactory toner-transferring
properties, to cause little paper dust,
not to cause defects of images by adhesion of paper
dust on a photosensitive member and an electrostatic
charging roll, etc., to be attracted well to the
transfer drum, and so forth.Ink-jet printing paper for exclusive use for
ink-jet printing is disclosed in JP-A-1-135682 to
satisfy the above requirements for the ink-jet printing
system. However, for mono-color printing and business
color printing by ink-jet system, use of inexpensive
usual plain paper is desired like the one generally
used in electrophotographic printing.On the other hands, in electrophotographic
printing, neutralized paper has come to be used in
place of conventionally used acidic paper for
improvement in storability and other purposes. JP-A-51-13244,
JP-A-59-162561 and JP-A-2-54543, for example,
disclose neutralized paper as toner-transfer paper
having excellent electrophotographic printing
characteristics.The conventional plain paper for electrophotographic
printing, when used for ink-jet printing, has 
disadvantages such that ink absorbency is so low that
ink spreads out unnecessarily if a large amount of ink
is applied, and that the ink is absorbed along paper
fibers to result in unsharpness of the ink dot shape.For offsetting such disadvantages, the
