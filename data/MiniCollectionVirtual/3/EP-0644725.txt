 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CULTURING PLANT MATERIALS AS FOODSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(1) Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to an incubator apparatus and a method for preparing an aerobically cultured food from a plant material. In particular, the present invention relates to an incubator apparatus and a method for aerobically culturing a plant material, primarily soybeans, provided with a beneficial microorganism, preferably a fungus of the genusRhizopus , to prepare a Tempeh. The soybean can also be extended with a portion of barley cereal grain or other cereal grains.The incubator apparatus is comprised of a container for a water bath. A water circulation means having a sensor controlled heater coil as a first heater means warms the water bath during the first half of the incubating process and causes the water bath to flow throughout the container. This helps to maintain uniformity of temperature in the water bath while the plant material is being aerobically cultured to form the Tempeh. The sensor also controls the cooling of the water bath during the second half of the incubation process. A second heater means is mounted in the container for heating the water bath to a high temperature. To prepare the Tempeh, shallow metal trays, preferably made of stainless steel, are filled with the plant material and supported on racks so that the trays are partially immersed in the water bath. The trays are preferably arranged side-by-side on the racks as units and a plurality of racks are mounted in parallel in the water bath. The trays can be of various sizes, although it is preferred that they have a depth of about 1 inch(2.54 cm) and the plant material is provided in the 

trays up to a depth of about 0.75 inches (1.9 cm). A removeable lid or cover mounts over and around the trays filled with the plant material. The cover can be a single, continuous member covering all of the tray units in the water bath, or there can be individual covers, preferably for each side-by-side tray unit. A lower rim portion of the cover is immersed in the water bath to seal the cover over and around the trays. An aerating means is centrally located in the water bath between each side-by-side tray unit so that an airflow bubbles up through the water bath and moves over the plant material held in the trays. The airflow exits through perforations provided in the cover, away from the aerating means. During the culturing process, the microorganisms aerobically grow to produce enzymes that act on the proteins,
