<ABSTRACT>
In a coaxial connector which comprises a coaxial 
connector receptacle (93) having a receptacle outer contact 

(169), and a coaxial connector plug (95) having a plug outer 
contact (101) with a first contact portion (107) brought into 

contact with a receptacle outer contact and a second contact 
portion (111) brought into contact with an outer conductor 

(155) of a coaxial cable (99), the first contact portion and 
the second contact portion of the coaxial connector plug are 

integrally coupled through a coupling portion (113). The 
second contact portion has a plurality of press-bonding pieces 

(123, 127) which penetrate a sheath (153) of the coaxial cable 
to be brought into contact with the outer conductor of the 

coaxial cable. The press-bonding pieces are arranged so as to 
surround the coaxial cable. Preferably, the coaxial connector 

plug has a plug inner contact (105) which has a press-contact 
portion (145) to be press-contacted with an inner conductor 

(159) of the coaxial cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coaxial connector plug
according to the preamble of claim 1
and to a coaxial connector comprising a coaxial
connector plug and a coaxial connector receptacle.Generally, the coaxial cable comprises from the inside
in a sequential order an inner conductor, an insulator, an
outer conductor, and a sheath generally concentrically.The coaxial connector plug comprises an outer contact,
a clamp ring, an inner contact, and an insulator. The outer
contact is connected to the outer conductor of the coaxial
cable. The clamp ring is deformed and thereby fixes the outer
contact to the coaxial cable. The inner contact is
electrically connected to the inner conductor of the coaxial
cable by soldering or the like. The insulator insulates the
inner contact from the outer contact.In a conventional coaxial connector plug of the type
mentioned above, the outer contact and the clamp ring are
prepared as separate parts, respectively. Accordingly, this
increases the number of parts and results in an increase of
production cost.Additionally, in the conventional coaxial connector
plug, a skilled workman is required to connect, by soldering, 
the inner contact to the inner conductor of the coaxial cable.
Further, there is a risk that peripheral parts of the inner
contact suffer a damage or scorching due to heat generated in
the soldering operation.Furthermore, one end portion of the coaxial cable is
processed into a stepped form so that the inner conductor and
the outer conductor are exposed at different axial positions,
in order to be connected to the inner contact and the outer
contact of the coaxial connector plug, respectively. Such a
processing treatment to the end portion of the coaxial cable is
troublesome.Description will now be made as regards the coaxial
connector receptacle. The coaxial connector receptacle
comprises an outer contact, an insulator, and a central
contact. The outer contact is electrically fittedly connected
to the outer contact of the coaxial connector plug. The
insulator is received in the outer contact. The central
contact is press-fit into and through the central part of the
insulator to be fixed.In such a conventional connector receptacle, the central
contact is press-fittedly fixed to the insulator. In such a
case, it is a disadvantage that a production cost is increased
because further equipment and production step for press-fitting
are required.A coaxial connector plug according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from EP 0 412 412 A1. It is an object of this
