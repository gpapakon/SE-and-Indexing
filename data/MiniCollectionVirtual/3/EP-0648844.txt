<ABSTRACT>
Human extracted DNA is treated by PCR and a sequence 
technique. Fluorophore-labelled DNA fragments are subjected 

to gel electrophoresis and illuminated with laser light. The 
emitted fluorescence is detected and the output waveform is 

compared with the reference waveform of a normal subject to 
check for the presence of any abnormal site in the base 

sequence of interest. The labelled DNA fragments have sizes 
of no more than 500 base pairs and they are electrophoresed 

over tracks not longer than 100 mm. The method is suitable 
for primary screening and only carriers having abnormal base 

sequences in their genes can be located from a large 
population of subjects with great rapidity and at low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the analysis of DNA base 
sequences. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
method of primary screening for detecting human hereditary 
diseases by analyzing the base sequences of human DNA. With the recent advances in genetic engineering, it has 
been found that many human hereditary diseases originate from 
mutations in the base sequences of DNA and other proteins. In 
addition, the progress in the mapping of base sequences has 
urged researchers to conduct gene therapy on some diseases by 
utilizing the extracorporeal cell culture through selective 
cultivation of normal cells so that cells having an abnormal 
base sequence are brought to the normal condition and then 
putting the so normalized cells back into the living body. Under the circumstances, a number of techniques have 
been developed for detecting variations in the sites of base 
substitutions and they all require a final verification to be 
done by performing highly reliable base sequence analyses. 
Since those techniques are only capable of indirect 
identification of variations by comparing the sizes of DNA 
fragments, their results must be rechecked by base sequence 
analyses that are capable of direct detection of the 
variations. Diagnoses of hereditary diseases in fetus have 
heretofore been conducted by quantitative determination of 
abnormal metabolites, by enzymological approaches and the like 
and whichever method is to be used, the expression of 
characters has been absolutely necessary for the success of 
fetal diagnoses. In contrast, the DNA diagnostic approach 
does not require the expression of characters in the cells of 
amniotic fluid or placental villi as long as cellular, 
villous, blood and other specimens are available. Because of 
this advantage, the DNA-based approach is capable of 
diagnosing phenylketonuria (PKU), ornithine transcarbamylase 
(OTC) deficiencies and other diseases that have defied the 
fetal diagnostic approach.  A major reason for the recent advances in the DNA 
diagnoses of hereditary diseases is the wide-spread use of 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR has the advantages 
of requiring only small amounts of samples to be analyzed and 
assuring highly operational convenience; in addition, the 
adoption of PCR has enabled the intended results to be 
attained within comparatively short periods of time. The currently employed practical DNA diagnoses including 
the step of PCR are classified into the following five basic 
processes:

In a method of primary screening for carriers having 

abnormal DNA base sequences that comprises the steps of 
amplifying a human extracted DNA by PCR, treating the PCR 

amplified product by a sequence technique to prepare DNA 
fragments, provided that the DNA is labelled with a 

fluorophore during the treatment by said sequence technique, 
then injecting the fluorophore-labelled DNA fragments into 

dents at the upper end of the electrolyte layer in the 
electrophoresis plate of a gel electrophoretic apparatus, 

applying a voltage to said electrolyte layer so that said DNA 
fragments are migrated, applying laser light to the migrating 

DNA fragments in a position a predetermined distance away from 
said dents, receiving the emitted fluorescence from said 

fragments by fluorescence detecting means, and outputting the 
reception signal as a waveform, characterized in that the 

fluorophore-labelled DNA fragments prepared by said sequence 
technique have lengths not more than 500 base pairs, that the 

length of electrophoresis tracks extending from the bottom of 
said dents to the point of incidence of laser light is no more 

than 100 mm, and that the base sequence of the DNA in each 
fraction is checked for the site of mutation by comparing said 

waveform output with the reference waveform of a normal
