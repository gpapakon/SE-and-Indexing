<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat
exchanger manifold tank with a tie bar
and to a method of assembly of a heat
exchanger manifold.Heat exchangers of the type which are employed in automobiles,
for example, as charged air coolers for turbochargers,
comprise a manifold in the form of separate tank and header
parts which are joined together to define a manifold housing.
This housing is connected to a large number of heat exchange
tubes through which air to be cooled is passed. The heat
exchange tubes are connected at end portions thereof to the
header part.Such manifolds are subject to expansions arising from elevated
temperatures and pressures, which render them liable to
failure. Conventionally, the tank parts are reinforced to
resist this expansion by the provision of increased wall
thickness, the addition of internal and/or external ribbing,
or the addition of internal tie bars which extend between
inner walls of the tank, and which are cast with the tank or
are welded in position. An increase in the header material
gauge may also be employed as a means of reinforcement.There are a number of problems with these means of
strengthening. The addition of extra material for
strengthening adds weight and increases the cost of the tank.
It also complicates the tooling, patterns, moulds etc which
are required. Where internal tie bars are welded into
position within the tank there is a risk of catastrophic 
failure should a weld joint fail or a tie bar become
dislodged. Where the tie bars are cast in position, this
complicates the manufacture, and may require secondary
operations to complete the casting, or the use of more than
one sand core. Such casting procedures also require
additional cleansing in order to remove residue created during
this additional casting.It has previously been proposed in French Patent Appliation,
published No 2614980 to provide in a plastics tank a
transverse generally U-shaped strengthening wire which is
fitted across the tank housing, legs of which are received in
bores moulded into opposite sides of the tank. It is,
however, particularly difficult to locate the wires in the
bores since the ends of the wires must be aligned exactly with
the bores before they can be received therein. Also, although
these provide a strengthening function in a plastics tank,
such wires would be quite inadequate for strengthening a cast
metal tank for use as a charged air cooler tank.An object of the invention is to provide a heat exchanger tank
which
overcomes the problems discussed
