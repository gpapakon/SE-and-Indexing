<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to viscous conjugated diene block 
copolymers. Further, the invention relates to cross-linked 
epoxidized polymers made from such block copolymers and adhesive, 
coating, and sealant compositions made therefrom. Curing of hot melt adhesives based on conjugated dienes and, 
optionally, vinyl aromatics has increased the range of service 
properties for such adhesives. Radiation curing and chemical 
curing are known. This curing causes covalent cross-linking of the 
polymerized conjugated dienes which is evidenced by a high gel 
content of the cross-linked polymer. Before cross-linking, the 
polymers are melt processable but after cross-linking, the gel 
cannot be processed as melts. Cross-linking therefore enhances 
solvent resistance and improves elevated temperature shear 
properties. The compositions can therefore be applied to a 
substrate in a melt and then cross-linked to form a superior 
adhesive. However, improvements in the adhesives, coatings and 
sealants could be made if the adhesives could be processed at lower 
temperatures and cured at lower dosages of radiation. Radiation curing and chemical curing of these polymers to make 
coatings and sealants is known. Before cross-linking, the polymers 
are processable in solvent solution but after cross-linking, the 
gel cannot be processed as a solution. The cross-linking therefore 
enhances solvent resistance and improves toughness and cohesion. 
The compositions can therefore be applied to a substrate from 
solvent solution and then cross-link to form a superior coating or 
sealant. However, improvements in the coatings and sealants could 
be made if the coatings and sealants could be processed at higher 
solids content and cured at lower dosages of radiation or at lower 
temperatures in chemical cure.  Further, the known curable adhesives, sealants and coatings 
which are based on conjugated diene block copolymers do not have 
particularly good long term heat, weather and ultraviolet stability 
due to the need to utilize unhydrogenated polymers having one 
residual aliphatic double bond per polymerized unit. The known 
vinyl aromatic-conjugated diene block copolymer based adhesives, 
coatings and sealants which are curable are unhydrogenated 
polymers. Hydrogenation is known to improve long term heat, 
weather and ultraviolet stability, but it removes the double bonds 
which are needed to effect the curing. Such curing methods are not 
effective when the polymers are hydrogenated. The requirement for 
this unsaturation is
