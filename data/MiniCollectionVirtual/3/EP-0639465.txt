<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus such as a printing apparatus, an electronic
reproduction apparatus, etc. and, more particularly, to
an image forming apparatus having a removable feed unit
for feeding an image forming material, and to the feed
unit.Generally, a printing apparatus is used for
processing paper of the same size in large quantities. A
paper feeding apparatus for feeding the paper to the
printing apparatus, therefore, is designed to load large
quantities of paper of specific size, to be attached to
the printing apparatus, and to feed the paper.Conventional printing apparatus and the paper
feeding apparatus are connected into a one-body special
machine for printing only the paper of a certain specific
size on the whole.The conventional printing apparatus or paper feeding
apparatus is applicable only to printing paper of a
specific size, and is not widely usable for various sizes
of paper.In the conventional image forming apparatus
described above, when paper of a size not usable in the 
paper feeding apparatus connected to the image forming
apparatus is to be fed, it gets necessary to replace the
existing paper feeding apparatus with another paper
feeding apparatus suitable for the paper size. However,
the conventional paper feeding apparatus stated above,
having a pick-up roller, etc. for picking up the paper
loaded and for feeding it into the printing apparatus, is
of so complicated construction and heavy weight as to
defy easy installation and removal.In view of the above-described various disadvantages
inherent in the heretofore known apparatus, it is an
object of the present invention to provide an image
forming apparatus in which a paper feed unit can very
easily be installed and removed in accordance with the
size of paper to be used, and the paper feed unit of
simple construction as stated above.US-A-5,026,041 discloses an image forming
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. The
present invention is characterized by the features of the
characterizing portion of claim 1. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described,
by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings,
of which:
Fig. 1 is a side view of one embodiment of the
present invention;Fig. 2 is a front view of one embodiment of the
present invention with a feed unit mounted;Fig. 3 is a front view of one embodiment of the
present invention;Fig. 4 is a front view of a body in one embodiment 
of the present invention;Fig. 5 is a typical perspective view showing a

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus, comprising: a body
(3) having a first connecting section; a pick-up means (13)

mounted in one part of said body for taking an image
forming sheet into said body; a sheet feed unit (7,8,9,10)

having a second connecting section, the unit being
constructed separately from said body and detachably

mounted in one part of said body for holding a plurality of
said sheets stacked thereon; and an image forming means

for forming an image on said sheet taken by said pick-up
means;

characterized in that:

said sheet feed unit includes first retaining means
(23,55,57) at the upper portion thereof, and said body

includes second retaining means (24,56,58) which is mounted
for engagement with said first retaining means so that the

sheet feed unit can be held suspended from said body
without contacting said body except at the retaining

portion thereof and the sheet feed unit is movable while
suspended to a fastening position where the first and

second connectors are connected together.
An image forming apparatus as claimed in claim 1,
wherein one of said first retaining means and said second 

retaining means is a hook (23), and the other of said first
retaining means and said second retaining means is a shaft-like

means (24) engaged with said hook (23).
An image forming apparatus as claimed in claim 1,

wherein at least one of said first retaining means and said
second retaining means is a rail member (57,58).
