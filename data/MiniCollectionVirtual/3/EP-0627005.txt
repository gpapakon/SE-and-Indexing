<DESCRIPTION>
 IBV SPIKE PROTEIN (2) Background of the invention1. Field of the invention This invention relates to the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and to a reco binant DNA method of preparing it. IBV is a virus which causes respiratory disease in the fowl, and is of particular importance in relation to poultry.2. Description of the prior art IBV is a virus of the type Coronaviridae. It has a single- stranded RNA genome, approximately 20 kb in length, of positive polarity, which specifies the production of three major structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein, membrane glycoprotein, and spike glycoprotein. The spike glycoprotein is so called because it is present in the teardrop-shaped surface projections or spikes protruding from the lipid membrane of the virus. The spike protein is believed likely to be responsible for immunogenicity of the virus, partly by analogy with the spike proteins of other coronaviruses and partly by in vitro neutralisation experiments, see, for example, D. Cavanagh t al- , Avian Pathology IS, 573-583 (1984). Although the term "spike protein" is used to refer to the glycoproteinaceous material of the spike, it has been characterised by D. Cavanagh, Journal of General Virology , 1187-1191; 1787-1791; and 2577-2583 (1983) as comprising two or three copies each of two glycopolypeptides,51 (90,000 daltons) and S2 (84,000 daltons). The polypeptide components of the glycopolypeptides SI and S2 have been estimated after enzymatic removal of oligosaccharides to have a combined molecular weight of approximately 125,000 daltons. It appears that the spike protein is attached to the viral membrane by the52 polypeptide. Thus, the protein comprises an extra cellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic anchor domain.European Patent Application Publication No. 218625A NRDC (and equivalent US Patent 5,032,520 and corresponding application in Japan) discloses the cloning of cDNA sequences coding for the spike protein precursor as well as sequences coding specifically 

for the SI and S2 polypeptides. Such a DNA molecule which codes for an IBV spike protein will hereinafter be referred to as "spike DNA" for brevity. The disclosed spike DNA codes for the whole spike protein, i.e. all 3 domains. Summary of the inventionIt has now been found that it is unnecessary to clone the whole spike cDNA disclosed in European Patent 218625A in order to obtain an im unological response: a truncated "spike DNA" considerably shorter in length may be cloned and expressed to produce a
