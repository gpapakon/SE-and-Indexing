<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
the controlled operation of engine operation cycles 
and more particularly to a preestablished logic 
pattern and the modifying the preestablished logic 
pattern to sequentially, and modulateably controlling 
valve timing for exhaust gas recirculation to reduce 
nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Future diesel engines need to comply with 
nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission standards which are 
continually being reduced. The emission standards are 
aimed at reducing air pollution from exhaust gases in 
line with the public interest in environmental 
protection. Generally speaking, there are two 
techniques of reducing NOx emission. One is improving 
combustion by lowering the combustion temperature and 
the other is after treatment of exhaust gases. In the 
conventional engine after treatment of exhaust gases 
by means of a catalytic converter is the main 
technique used to reduce NOx. This technique, 
however, has demerits of durability of the converter 
or air/fuel ratio control system especially oxygen 
sensors as well as cost. For the larger engine, these 
demerits become more severe problems. Whereas the 
technique for lowering NOx through improvement of 
combustion has merit especially with regard to 
durability and thermal efficiency of the engine.  
 Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) has been 
shown to reduce NOx emissions with smaller brake 
specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and exhaust smoke 
penalties. Exhaust gas recirculation lowers NOx by 
diluting the fresh charge air with exhaust gas which 
lowers peak combustion temperatures and thus, reduces 
NOx production. A preferred method of EGR is to have the 
exhaust gas cooled before being mixed with the charge 
air. Previous means of providing cooled EGR include 
transferring exhaust gas from the exhaust system to 
the air inlet system using external engine plumbing, a 
pump, and a heat exchanger to cool the exhaust gas. 
The exhaust gas is transferred from the exhaust system 
before or after the turbocharger turbine and to the 
air intake system before or after the turbocharger 
compressor. The result being increased customer cost 
and a greater possibility of hardware failure due to 
an increased number of components and complexity. Thus, what is needed is an apparatus to 
obtain cooled EGR without the external hardware by 
using the capabilities within an engine having 
electronically controlled unit intake and exhaust 
valves and fuel injectors. The present invention is directed to 
overcome one or more of
