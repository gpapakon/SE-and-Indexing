<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an improved roof/wall panel. Known 
panels suffer from a number of problems, eg, it has been 

found that they may become loose in high winds. 
Accordingly, the invention provides a roof or wall panel 

(10, 10', 10'', 10a, 10'a, 10b, 10'b, 10''b) comprising a 
substantially rectangular planer member having an outer 

layer (40, 40', 40'', 40a, 40'a) characterised in that at 
least part of the outer layer extends beyond a side edge 

(51, 51a) of the panel which side edge may form a 
longitudinal edge, in use, so as to form a raised lip such 

that when the side edge of the panel is positioned adjacent 
to an opposing longitudinal side edge (50', 50'a) of another 

panel the lip of the side edge of the panel overlaps at 
least part of the opposing side edge of the other panel. In 

a preferred embodiment the outer layer (40, 40', 40'', 40a, 
40'a) is a prelaminated plastics-to-metal layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to roof or wall panels, and
in particular to panels employing a prelaminated
plastics-to- metal layer.It is known to use prelaminated plastics-to-metal
sheeting in various roofing applications such as in
providing backing angles or counter flashing. Also,
metal sheet panels are often used in preference to
conventional lead or copper roofs, these panels
frequently being fabricated from aluminium based alloys.
Such panels are secured side by side in a waterproof
joint, and are normally clinked together. In the case of
metal sheeting, hidden cleat fixings are used to clip the
sheets in place. A problem arises, however, in that a
high degree of skill requires to be exercised by a
tradesman in making the seams between these panels or
sheets waterproof.It is an object of this invention to obviate or
mitigate the aforesaid disadvantagesIt is also known from EP-A-0409513, to provide a
panel comprising a substantially rectangular planar
member having a middle layer of an insulating material
and inner and outer layers, and having first and second
longitudinal sides the panel being adapted for fitting
together with similar panels upon a longitudinal
supporting structure which provides upstanding portions
extending along and between first and second longitudinal
side faces of adjacent panels, the panel having means
along the first longitudinal side whereby the panel may
be fixed to the upstanding portion of the supporting
structure.A problem exists with such previously known panels
in that it has on occasion been found that they become
loose and/or are removed from a roof by high winds or the
like. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention
to obviate or mitigate the aforementioned disadvantage.Accordingly, one aspect the present invention
provides a roof or wall panel of the type disclosed in
EP-A-0409513 characterised in that at least part of the
outer layer extends beyond the second longitudinal side
of the panel so as to form a raised lip, such that when
the second longitudinal side of the panel is positioned
adjacent to the first longitudinal side of another panel,
said lip will extend over the upstanding portion of the
supporting structure and overlap the first longitudinal
side edge of the other panel, such that the panel can
effectively be fixed to said supporting structure by
fixing the lip to said other panel.The opposing longitudinal side edge of the other
panel may also be formed with a (raised) lip.In one embodiment of the panel the outer layer may
comprise a
