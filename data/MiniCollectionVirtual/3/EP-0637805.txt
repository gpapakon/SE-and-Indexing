<ABSTRACT>
A technique of using an electronic dictionary in conjunction with electronically-encoded 
running text that gives the user the most relevant information rather than belaboring 

the user with all possible information about a selected word. The technique maps the selected 
word from its inflected form to its citation form, analyzes the selected word in the context of 

neighboring and surrounding words to resolve ambiguities, and displays the information that 
is determined to be the most likely to be relevant. The dictionary preferably has information 

about multi-word combinations that include the selected word, and the context determination 
typically entails checking whether the selected word is part of a predefined multi-word 

combination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computerized information retrieval devices or
systems, and more specifically to techniques for using an electronic dictionary in connection with a
body of electronically encoded text.Electronically encoded dictionaries and the like have become commonplace, and find
applicability both in conjunction with word processing programs and as a stand-alone reference
works. However, current electronic dictionaries are typically derived from a printed dictionary and
display the information in the same format. When information from the dictionary is requested, as
for example, by selecting a word in the text, all the information for that word is presented. If the
word has more than one syntactic category or is otherwise ambiguous, the user can determine
which of the displayed information is relevant. Thus, the only advantage of the use of the
electronic dictionary over a use of a printed dictionary is that the lookup is faster and the results
can be displayed on the same screen that displays the text.EP-A-0 525 470 discloses a method for translating words of a source language into words
of a target language, wherein an intermediate source structure is generated from the source text.
Hypothetical target structures are generated from the target language and a statistical scoring
process is performed between the two structures to find the best possible candidates. The results
are displayed for the user.The present invention provides a technique of using an electronic dictionary in
conjunction with electronically encoded running text, but in a way that gives the user the most
relevant information rather than belaboring the user with all possible information about a selected
word.In brief, the present invention maps the selected word from its inflected form (sometimes
referred to as surface form) to a set of information including its citation form (sometimes referred to
as dictionary form or lexical form), analyzes the selected word in the context of neighboring and
surrounding words to resolve ambiguities, and displays the information that is determined to be the
most likely to be relevant. The user is free to request additional information, in which case either
the next most relevant information or all information about the selected word is provided. The
dictionary preferably has information about multi-word combinations that include the selected word,
and the context determination typically entails checking whether the selected word is part of a
predefined multi-word

<CLAIMS>
A computerized method for retrieving information from an electronically
encoded dictionary, the method using a first body of electronically encoded

text having words in sentences and the electronically encoded dictionary
having meanings associated with citation forms of at least some of the

words in the text and with multi-word combinations, the method comprising
the steps of:


receiving input from a user selecting (60) a word from within the first body of
text;
selecting (65) a second body of text within said first body of text immediately
surrounding the selected word and including the selected word and

communicating it to a morphological analyzer,
then analyzing and mapping (70) each word in the second body of text from
its inflected form to its possible citation forms and information about the

relation between the inflected form and the citation form with said
morphological analyzer;
communicating (75) the possible citation forms and information about the

relation between the inflected form and the citation form to a probabilistic
disambiguator, wherein said disambiguator determines a most probable

citation form for each word in the second body of text based on said
information about relations between inflected forms and citation forms of

words in said second body of text;
using (80) the most probable citation form of the selected word to access
the dictionary; 
determining (85) whether any of the multi-word combinations in the
dictionary is present in the second body of text containing said selected

word;
if a matching multi-word combination is found, communicating (90) a
meaning contained in the dictionary and associated with the matching multi-word

combination to a user and after said communicating (90) step,
allowing said user to request (100) a meaning contained in the dictionary

and associated with the most probable citation form of the selected word;
if a matching multi-word combination is not found, communicating (95) the
meaning contained in the dictionary and associated with the most probable

citation form of the selected word to the user;
allowing (100) the user to request additional information on said selected
word; and
communicating (105) to the user additional information in response to the
request for additional information.
The method of claim 1 wherein the morphological analyzer is implemented
as a finite state transducer.
The method of claim 1 wherein said step of determining the most probable
citation form for each word in the second body of text is performed using a

hidden Markov model.
The method of claim 1 wherein the dictionary meaning and the additional
information is communicated to the user by a visual display.
The method of claim 1, wherein said additional information is a meaning
contained in the dictionary and associated with the next most probable

citation form, said method further comprising the steps of:

allowing the user to request all available dictionary information associated
with the selected word other than the meaning associated with the most

probable citation form;
communicating all citation forms of the selected word other than said most
probable citation form to the dictionary; 
communicating to the user all meanings contained in the dictionary and
associated with all citation forms other than the most probable citation form.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the following steps after said
request for additional information step:


determining a set of possible citation forms of the selected word with said
probabilistic disambiguator, said determination based on a set of

probabilistic states of the selected word within said sentence structure of the
second body of text, wherein said set of possible citation forms is

differentiated by the probability of a particular citation form being the correct
citation form; and
allowing the user to select a level of said set of possible citation forms,
wherein said additional information are all meanings contained in the

dictionary and associated with all citation forms of the selected level other
than the most probable citation form.
The method of claim 1, wherein

said steps of communicating a meaning and
communicating the meaning are implemented as steps of displaying, and wherein, 
in response to a request by a user for additional information,
all citation forms of the selected word other than said most probable citation

form are communicated to the dictionary, wherein said additional information are all meanings
contained in the dictionary and associated with all citation forms other than

the most probable citation from; and
displaying to the user said additional information.
