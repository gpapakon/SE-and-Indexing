<ABSTRACT>
A stabilising composition for chlorine-containing polymers and chlorine-containing polymer compositions comprising     a) at least one organotin oxide compound of the formula  (RaSnOb)c     (I), in which R is C1-C18-alkyl; a is the number 1 or 2; b = (4-a)/2; and c is greater than or equal to 1; and b) at least one compound from the series comprising crystalline alkali/alkaline earth metal aluminosilicates.   Such polymer compositions are preferably employed for external applications.
