<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical disk, an
apparatus for reproducing information from optical disk and
method of recording/reproducing information on or from an
optical disk.FIG. 1 illustrates construction of a known optical
disk on which audio information and/or video information is
recorded. Information is converted into signals using pit
lengths as parameters, and the signals are recorded on
information recording surface 95 as information pits 91. In
reproduction, a laser light is converged on information pits
91 to form a light spot LS having predetermined diameter, and
reflected and diffracted light beam is detected by
photodetector, such as photodiode, to produce electric signal.
The electric signal is subjected to a conversion reverse to the
conversion in recording to obtain audio information or video
information recorded on the disk 92. As examples of such an
optical disk, Compact Disk (CD) and Laser Disk (LD) are known.
In FIG. 1, reference numeral 93 indicates substrate and
reference numeral 94 indicates protection layer.As described above, as to a known optical disk, 
reading light beam is irradiated on disk and recorded
information is read out based on variation of quantity of
reflected light beam resulting from presence or absence of
information pits. Information recording density of those
optical disks are limited by track pitch. As shown in FIG. 2,
track pitch P1 is an interval between neighboring tracks which
define center-lines of columns of information pits 91.
Recently, in order to increase recording density of optical
disk, various measures for reduction of track pitch are
developed.However, when track pitch is simply reduced to value
P2 smaller than conventional value P1 (e.g.
P2 = P1/2
) as
illustrated in FIG. 3, light spot LS of laser light covers not
only information pit 91A to be read-out but also information
pits 91B and 91C on neighboring tracks. This trial is hopeless
in practice because reproduced signal includes crosstalk
(intermixture of signals from neighboring tracks) too much.
Namely, in order to reduce crosstalk, track pitch must be large
enough compared with a diameter of light spot LS. This is a bar
against increasing recording density.In the above view, in order to improve recording
density, various methods for reducing diameter of light spot
of laser beam has been proposed. In general, radius W of light
spot LS is expressed as follows:
W = α × λ / NA (α:constant).
Here, NA is numerical aperture of objective lens, and λ is 
wavelength of laser light. Accordingly,
