<ABSTRACT>
An electric motor (2) for a clothes washing machine including the motor and 
a drive, the motor having a stator (25) held outboard of a frame carrying bearings (38, 

39) in which a shaft (11) rotates, the shaft carrying the rotor (21) outboard of the 
stator (25), and permanent magnets (17) on an inner face of the rotor. The stator (25) 

is formed as an annular helical yoke edgewise wound from a strip of magnetic material 
and having an inner face and an outer face, the strip having pole pieces (8) formed 

integrally therewith extending from one edge of the strip and the strip being edgewise 
wound whereby the pole pieces coincide in stacked groups to form a plurality of poles 

arrange at equally spaced intervals extending radially outwardly from the outer face of 
the yoke. Energisable stator windings (26) are wound directly on the poles (8) of the 

stator and are adapted to be energised through an electronic commutation circuit (65, 
66) and the rotor (21) is mounted for rotation exteriorly of and relative to the stator, 

the rotor comprising a backing ring (16) of magnetic material and a series of 
permanent magnets (17) held at spaced apart intervals on an inner surface of the 

backing ring (16) and opposing the poles (8) of the stator (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to clothes washing machines of the type having a cabinet in
which an agitator is mounted on a vertical axis and is oscillated back and forth within a
perforated spin tub which, in turn, is mounted within a watertight container, the spin tub
and the agitator rotating continously in one direction to give a spin action, the cabinet
containing an electric motor and driving means for the agitator and spin tub and/or
clothes washing machine incorporating such drives.A clothes washing machine of the general type described above is disclosed in USA
2,665,576. In the washing machine of USA 2,665,576 the agitator is fixed to the spin
tub. When an agitating action is required the spin tub is rotated back and forth
independently of the water tight container. When a spin action is required the spin tub
and water tight container are rotated together in one direction. The washing machine of
USA 2,665,576 has a float chamber for effecting engagement and/or disengagement of a
clutch mechanism which engages a spin tub with the water tight container. The
engagement and/or disengagement of the clutch mechanism is dependent on the quantity
of water present in the water tight container. The arrangement disclosed in USA
2,665,576 has a disadvantage that the agitator, spin tub and water tight container must
all be rotated during the spin action. Also, since the agitator and spin tub are connected
together, agitation is not as effective as it would be if the agitator was moving while the
spin tub was kept stationary. Another disadvantage with the washing machine disclosed
in USA 2,665,576 is that during a spin cycle there must be a hydraulic connection
between the water tight container and the spin tub which is less efficient than a direct
mechanical connection between the motor and the spin tub.
   FR 1,340,648 and DE 1,907,719 both disclose clothes washing machines having
motors which directly drive the wash drums without the need for belts and pulleys or
gearboxes. No control to produce
both the desired complex wash motion and a separate spin motion of the wash drum
is envisaged. CH 462,765 discloses an electric motor for a washing machine which attempts to
solve the difficulties of the conflicting requirements of wash motion and spin motion by
integrating two co-linear separate motors, one optimised for wash motion and the other
optimised for spin motion.
The increased axial length of the
motor results in reduced volumetric capacity of the driven wash drum and separate
current controllers are required
