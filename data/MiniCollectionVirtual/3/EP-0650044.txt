<ABSTRACT>
A chemiluminescent method is provided for the 
analysis of a target. A peroxidase is first bound as a 

labelling substance to the target by using a target 
specific binding reagent. The target so labelled is 

isolated and then reacted with luminol, hydrogen 
peroxide and an enhancer in an aqueous solvent. The 

luminescence of light is detected and measured. The 
aqueous solvent contains at least one protein selected 

from the group consisting of skim milk and egg albumin. 
Preferably, the aqueous solvent also contains a non-ionic 

surfactant such as a polyoxyethylene ether and/or 
a sugar alcohol such as mannitol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chemiluminescent 
analytical method, and more specifically to a method 
for improving the performance of chemiluminescent analysis 
in which a peroxidase is used as a labelling substance. As a method for detecting and measuring with good 
sensitivity a target to be analyzed (e.g., a substance 
to be measured), it is known to react a target specific 
binding reagent such as an antibody capable of specifically 
bonding to the substance - said binding reagent 
being often labelled in advance with an enzyme such as 
a peroxidase - with a test sample and then to detect 
and measure signals produced by the catalytic action of 
the enzyme, e.g., a peroxidase as a labelling substance. 
This method is generally called "enzyme immunoassay". 
This enzyme immunoassay is known to include 
a variety of improved or modified techniques, 
such as the single antibody technique, the double 
antibody technique, the sandwich technique, the 
homogeneous technique and the heterogeneous technique.  To permit efficient measurement of signals produced 
by catalytic action of an enzyme such as a peroxidase, 
chemiluminescence of luminol/hydrogen peroxide 
catalyzed by the peroxidase is measured. In this case, 
a compound which can enhance the chemiluminescent reaction 
is frequently used as an enhancer (Method in Enzymology, 
133, 331-353 (1986); U.S. Patent No. 
5,106,732). On the other hand, the activity of a peroxidase 
is known to increase by the addition of a polyoxyethylene 
ether [Clinica Chimica Acta, 109, 177=181 
(1981); J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem., 19, 435-439 
(1981)]. In enzyme immunoassay, it has been proposed 
to improve the S/N ratio or the sensitivity of measurement 
by incorporating a polyoxyethylene ether in a 
buffer (U.S. Patent No. 4,810,630). It is also known to treat a carrier or an 
antibody- (or antigen-) immobilized carrier with albumin 
or milk protein (Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-Open No. HEI 1-217266 which corresponds to U.S. 
Patent No. 5,017,559) or with egg albumin (Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-Open No. HEI 1-224665) in advance 
so that any non-specific reaction of the carrier 
or the antibody- (or antigen-) immobilized carrier can 
be blocked.  Where the target of the analysis is an ultratrace 
substance or the like in a living body, it is still 
desired to develop a method having still higher 
sensitivity. An object of the present invention is therefore 
to provide a high-sensitivity chemiluminescent analytical 
method. Regarding chemiluminescent analysis
