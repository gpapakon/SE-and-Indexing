<ABSTRACT>
A reduction-type mechanism with planetary gear train according to the invention may be fitted between an annulus gear (36) engaged with the output pinion (13) of the gearbox, and the box (16) which constitutes the input member of the differential. In this reduction gear, the annulus is guided in rotation on two smooth (plane) bearings (journals) and the reduction gear mechanism can be locked by means of a sliding sleeve (46). Such an arrangement, which is simple, takes little space, and is inexpensive, makes it possible to improve the drive of vehicles with two- or four-wheel drive, for example of the "all-terrain (off-road)" type.

A speed-reducing mechanism of planetary gear type, comprising a housing (10), 
a planet wheel carrier (16; 116) mounted rotatably in the housing, an annulus (36) with 

external (37) and internal (38) teeth, a sun wheel (32) and planet wheels (30) in mesh 
with the sun wheel and with the internal teeth (38) of the annulus, the planet wheel 

carrier (16; 116) defining at least one cylindrical bearing (34, 35), which supports the 
annulus (36) rotatably, characterized in that the planet wheel carrier (16; 116) has a 

first radial flange (24) defining one cylindrical bearing (34) and a second radial flange 
(26) parallel to the first and which defines therewith a space in which the planet wheels 

(30) of the reducing mechanism are received and which further defines a cylindrical 
bearing (35) located in the extension of the cylindrical bearing (34) of the said first 

radial flange (24), the two bearings (34, 35) providing the guiding for rotation of the 
annulus (36). 
A speed-reducing mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
second radial flange (26) is fixed to the first by studs (25), of which projecting parts 

(26
a
) determine the width of the free space formed between the two opposed faces (28, 
29) of the two flanges. 
A speed-reducing mechanism according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the annulus has a T-shaped transverse section, of which the vertical limb is received in 

and guided laterally in the space between the two flanges and of which the under parts 
of the two horizontal limbs cooperate with the cylindrical bearings (35, 35) of the two 

flanges (24, 26). 
A speed-reducing mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the planet wheel carrier (16; 116) comprises an axial part (33) defining a 

cylindrical bearing which rotatably supports the sun wheel (32). 
A speed-reducing mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises means allowing it to be set in one or the other of two states, these means  

 
comprising a sliding sleeve (46) mounted to slide between two position, namely a first 

position in which it renders two elements (24, 26; 32) of the planetary gear speed-reducing 
mechanism solid so as to lock up the mechanism, and a second position in 

which it frees these two elements and locks one (32) of them relative to the housing. 
A speed-reducing mechanism according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
sliding sleeve (46) has internal splines (47) in constant engagement with corresponding 

external splines (45) provided on an axial extension (44) of the sun wheel (32) of the 
speed-reducing mechanism and at least one external toothing (48) which can be placed 

selectively in engagement either with an internal toothing (40) provided on the planet 
wheel carrier (24, 26) of the speed-reducing mechanism or with an internal toothing 

(43) provided on a part (41) fixed to the housing. 
A speed-reducing mechanism according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
internal toothing (40) provided on the planet wheel carrier is formed on the second 

flange (26) fixed to the radial flange (24) of the planet wheel carrier. 
A transmission arrangement comprising a gearbox (11) and at least one 
differential (12) fitted in at least one housing (10), the gearbox comprising an output 

pinion (13) and the differential comprising a casing (16) which forms its input member 
and which is coulpled to an annulus (36) in engagement with the output pinion (13) of 

the gearbox, characterized in that a speed-reducing mechanism of planetary gear type 
as defined in any of claims 1 to 7 is interposed between the annulus (36) and the 

casing (16) of the differential, this casing (16) forming the planet wheel carrier of the 
speed-reducing mechanism, means (46) being provided to enable the speed-reducing 

mechanism to be placed in one or the other of two states: a first state in which it is 
locked up and does not effect any reduction in speed and a second state in which it 

functions to reduce the speed.
