<ABSTRACT>
A saw blade with saw teeth (15,16), in particular hard-metal saw 
teeth, which display a tooth tip (20,40) formed at the end facing 

away from the blade body (11) and a tooth root (25,45) lying opposite 
the tooth tip (20,40) has, on at least one outer side of at least 

some of the saw teeth, a projection (30) which displays a tip (33) 
directed to the side of the tooth tip (20) and lying at a distance 

from the latter. The distance between the tip of the 
projection and the tooth tip lies between 1/10 and 5/6 of 

the height of the saw tooth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a saw blade with saw teeth provided 
along one edge of the blade body, in particular hard-metal saw 
teeth, which display a tooth tip formed at the end facing away 
from the blade body and a tooth root lying opposite the tooth 
tip. Such saw blades, which are used for example as circular-saw 
blades for hand-held circular saws or circular-saw benches, but 
also as elongated saw blades pairwise in support plates of power 
saws, in which they are reciprocated in opposition in the direction 
of their longitudinal extension (EP 0 267 973 A1), are 
frequently also used to cut blocks from aerated cement or from 
so-called poroton, a porous brick material. Saw blades with saw 
teeth, optionally hardened, formed from the blade body material 
can be used for this purpose. However, saw blades in whose 
blade bodies saw teeth made from hard metal are used are preferably 
employed for this purpose. It should be pointed out that, 
in particular with hard-metal saw teeth but also with saw teeth 
which consist of the material of the blade body, the tooth tip 
need not be a tip coming to a sharp point in the geometric sense, 
but that a tooth tip is, in this case, a free end of the saw 
tooth thinned relative to the maximum width of the saw tooth.  If one attempts to saw aerated cement blocks with known saw 
blades, the result is a greasing of the aerated cement to be 
cut, and sawdust collects inside the kerf, which impairs the 
sawing process and can even lead to a jamming of the saw blade. For the sawing of poroton blocks, which are much harder than 
aerated cement blocks, saw blades whose saw teeth protrude less 
far from the blade body are usually chosen. Problems arise with 
this sawing process from the fact that, because of the hardness 
and material-texture differences of the poroton blocks, the saw 
blade can jam, especially if elongated saw blades are used which 
are relatively flexible over their length. The object of the invention is to improve a saw blade so that 
aerated cement blocks and/or poroton blocks can be better cut. To achieve this object, a saw blade of the type mentioned initially 
is so designed according to the invention that at least 
some of the saw teeth are provided, on at least one outer side, 
with a projection which has a tip directed to the side of the 
tooth tip and lying at a distance from the latter, the distance 
of the tip from the tooth tip being between 1/10 and 5/6 of the 
height of the saw tooth between tooth root and tooth tip. The effect of the
