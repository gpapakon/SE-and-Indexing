<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to: 

(1) a fusion protein having a dimerizing domain with or 
without a ligand-binding region and 
tox
R DNA-binding and 
hydrophobic transmembrane regions; 
(2) host cells comprising the fusion protein and a nucleic 
acid molecule having a reporter gene operatively linked to the 
ctx
 
operon, wherein dimerization (ligand-dependent or -independent) 

is signaled by expression of the reporter gene; 
(3) a nucleic acid molecule coding for the fusion protein; 
(4) an expression vector comprising a coding region for 
the fusion protein; 
(5) a process for detecting dimer formation (ligand 
dependent or ligand independent) of the fusion protein, which 

comprises treating a culture of the host cells with a ligand, ligand 
mimetic, or dimerization inhibitor, and screening for expression of 

the reporter gene. 
The present invention can be used to generate a signal 
from a variety of ligand-binding domains, allowing ligand binding 

to be indicated by a simple colorimeteric test or antibiotic 
resistance. The fusion proteins could include therapeutically 

relevant domains, so that biologically pertinent interactions can be 
indicated by a readily measurable signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to assays for protein-protein interactions, fusion proteins, and host cells modified to comprise such proteins.Information about the extracellular environment is communicated to the inside of a cell by so-called signal transduction systems. Schlessinger, J., TIBS13 : 443-7 (1988); Stock, J.B., et al., Microbiol. Rev. 53: 450-490 (1989). Several classes of signal transducers are able to "transmit" a signal without internalization of the primary signal. Such signal transmission may result from binding of a ligand to a membrane-bound receptor, inducing a conformational change in the receptor.One such signal transducer is the toxR-ctx system in Vibrio cholerae. Ctx is the gene for cholera toxin. ToxR protein is a transmembrane protein with a DNA-binding domain at its amino terminus, a strongly hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an environmentally regulated, dimer-forming domain at its carboxyl terminus. Miller, V. L., et al., Cell48: 271-279 (1984). According to current beliefs, the hydrophobic transmembrane region directs the carboxyl terminus to the periplasm while the amino terminus remains in the cytoplasm. A change in osmolarity or temperature in the periplasm is believed to effect the capacity of the toxR protein to form dimers with its carboxyl terminus. The carboxyl dimers in turn modulate the ability of the amino terminus of toxR to bind to repetitive sequences in the ctx promoter and, thereby, modulate the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription at the ctx promoter. Id.To test the hypothesis that toxR protein is a membrane protein, Miller et al. fused toxR protein with alkaline phosphatase (pboA). Cell48: 271-279 (1984). The phoA enzyme naturally exists as a dimer in the periplasm and the phoA-toxR fusion protein was constitutively functional with respect to both phosphatase activity and toxR activation of ctx. This result demonstrated that toxR was able to direct alkaline phosphatase to the periplasm where it was active, and that the dimerization capacity of alkaline phosphatase could direct the toxR protein to activate ctx transcription.In a similar fusion experiment, Mekalanos et al. fused toxR to a phoA mutant that requires Zn2+ for dimerization and activity (personal communication). This fusion protein's phosphatase activity was dependent on Zn2+, as expected, but so also was ctx activation. This result is consistent with the signal transduction model for toxR action.Chimeric signal transduction systems have been constructed in prokaryotic cells with
