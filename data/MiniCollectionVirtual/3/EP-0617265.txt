an electromagnetic force developed so as to counterbalance 
the applied force, the instrument including a force coil

by the up/down counter into an analog signal, and wherein 
the sum of the output of the D/A converter and the output 

of the analog arithmetic unit is fed back to the force coil,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a force measuring 
instrument, and more particularly to an instrument for determining 
the strength of an applied force by measuring the strength of an 
electromagnetic force developed so as to counterbalance the applied 
force, wherein the applied force means any load derivable from a 
mass, a load and a fluid pressure. As a typical example of the force measuring instruments an 
electronic balance and a diaphragm-implemented measuring instrument 
are known in the art, wherein the diaphragm-implemented measuring 
instrument means a measuring instrument having a diaphragm on which 
an external force such as fluid pressure is applied. These measuring 
instruments include a balanceable scale beam which is displaced under 
a force exerting on a weighing pan and a diaphragm secured to the 
scale beam, and in response to the displacement, an electromagnetic 
force is developed by a transducer having a force coil placed in the 
static electromagnetic field so as to compensate the displacement. 
The strength of the electromagnetic force is detected. At this 
stage no equilibrium is yet reached between the force and the  
 
electromagnetic force. The detecting result is subjected to PID 
operation, and then fed back to the force coil so as to obtain an 
optimum strength of electromagnetic force for achieving the 
equilibrium. In this way the applied force is determined by 
measuring the feedback current. The "PID" is a known symbol standing 
for proportionality signal (P), an integral signal (I) and a 
differential signal (D). However, the known system has the following problems and 
disadvantages: First, the detecting result is represented in analog quantity, 
and the PID operation is performed in analog. The resulting signal 
is fed back to the force coil, and the current flowing through the 
force coil is converted into analog voltage signal through a 
resistance, and is then digitalized by an A/D (analog-to-digital) 
converter. The digitalized signal is supplied to a microcomputer, and 
the resulting measuring value is arithmetically operated like 
averaging, and displayed as a mean value. In such an analog servomechanism it is required to employ an 
A/D converter having a relatively large number of bits so as to 
achieve high precision without sacrificing the dynamic range. As a 
whole the system becomes expensive because of the unavoidable 
provision of an A/D converter having a large number of bits and a high 
responsibility. Second, the resistance through which
