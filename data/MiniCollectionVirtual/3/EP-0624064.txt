<ABSTRACT>
A method for preserving bulk fresh foodstuffs by heat treatment, wherein the foodstuffs are passed through a low-pressure chamber (3) and exposed to a counter-flow of steam which condenses on the foodstuffs and thereby delivers the heat required to heat them.

<CLAIMS>
Device for preservation of bulk fresh 
foodstuffs by heat treatment, characterized in that it 

comprises a vessel (2) in which the foodstuffs are 
introduced and heated by the condensation of steam moving 

in a direction opposite to that of the foodstuffs, 
comprising an upper chamber (3) which is connected via a 

condenser (11) to a vacuum pump (9) in which the constant 
pressure is lower than the atmospheric pressure, and one or 

more lower housings (4) separated from the enclosure (3) by 
perforated grids (7) and in which a pressure prevails (P
2
) 
which is higher than the pressure (P
1
) prevailing in the 
upper chamber (3), and an airlock (1) intended to introduce 

the foodstuffs into the vessel (2) and a positive 
displacement pump (5) arranged at the exit of the vessel 

(2) and which removes the product therefrom. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that it comprises a flowmeter (17) through which the 

covering liquid coming from a tank (15) is introduced into 
the housing(s) (4) arranged between the bottom of the 

vessel (2) and the perforated plates (7). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the covering liquid is heated via a double wall 

(13) itself heated by a circulation of steam coming from an 
external circuit (14). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims characterized in that this device also comprises 

sensors or detectors (20, 21, 23 and 29) which monitor the 
operation of the system. 
Device according to any of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the device comprises, 
following the reduced-pressure vessel (2) and the positive 

displacement pump (5), a pressurized chamber (27). 
Device according to claim 5, characterized 
in that it comprises a second pump (33) which sucks the 

product out of the pressurized chamber (27). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the pump (33) is arranged between two cooling 

stages of a cooling unit (35). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the pump (33) is located at the exit of the 

pressurized chamber (27) and before the cooling stage (35). 
Method for preservation of bulk fresh 
foodstuffs by heat treatment, characterized in that the 

foodstuffs are introduced under reduced pressure through 
the device according to any of the claims 1 to 8 by 

subjecting these foodstuffs to a flow of steam in a 
direction opposite to that of their movement, the steam 

condensing on the foodstuffs while thus providing them with 
a part of the heat needed for their heating. 
Method according to claim 9, 
characterized in that it is in the form of a semicontinuous 

or continuous method. 
Method according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterized in that the method is carried out without 

external supply of steam, the steam being generated from 
the water released from the foodstuffs and from a covering 

liquid necessary for aseptic filling.
