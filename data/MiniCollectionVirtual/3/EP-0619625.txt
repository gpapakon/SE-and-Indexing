Electrical connector (CE) including a module 
carrier (PM) and a wiring chamber (CC) which are separate 

but adjacent, the said module carrier having a plurality 
of connection modules (MC) which form, on the side 

opposite the said wiring chamber, a plug-in face (FE) 
enabling the said connector to be connected to a 

complementary electrical connector, which is similar or 
different, but which is provided with a complementary 

plug-in face and on the side facing the said wiring 
chamber a connection face (FB) for the ends of electrical 

conductors penetrating into the said wiring chamber 
through the wall thereof, the said modules being provided 

with connection members (8) passing through them in order 
to provide the electrical connection between the said 

plug-in face and the said connection face, characterized: 

in that the said plurality of connection modules 
(MC) is arranged in rows and in columns in order to 

give the said module carrier (PM), parallel to the 
said plug-in face, an approximately square section; 

and 
in that the said wiring chamber (CC) consists of two 
shells (C1, C2) which can be joined together, as 

well as to the said module carrier. 
Electrical connector according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the wall of the said wiring 

chamber, through which the said electrical conductors 
penetrate, is oblique and oriented in the direction of 

the said conductors. 
Electrical connector according to one of 
Claims 1 and 2, in which ducts are provided surrounding 

the said electrical conductors and solidly fastened to 
the wall of the said wiring chamber through which the 

said conductors penetrate into the latter, characterized 
in that: 


the said ducts consist of two half-ducts which can 
be joined longitudinally; and 
the said ducts are held solidly fastened to the said 
wiring chamber by being held trapped between the  

 
said joined shells. 
Electrical connector according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that each half-duct (30, 40) is provided 

with a transverse base platelet (32, 37), in that the 
said transverse base platelets form, after joining the 

said half-ducts, transverse base plates (36) for the said 
ducts and in that slots (54) are provided in the 

thickness of side walls (52) of the said shells in order 
to serve as a housing for the said transverse base plates 

(36). 
Electrical connector according to Claim 3 or 
4, characterized in that each half-duct (40) has a 

semicircular section. 
Electrical connector according to Claim 3 or 
4, characterized in that each half-duct (30) has a U-shaped 

section. 
Electrical connector according to one of 
Claims 3 and 4, characterized in that it includes at 

least one assembly (ECH) of two associated ducts, in 
which each of the said ducts is shaped, at its free end 

opposite the said connector, with a flat (42), the said 
associated ducts being adjoinable, one against the other, 

by their respective flats (42), in order to form an end 
sleeve (43), which is common, although internally divided 

by the said flats, for the passage of the said electrical 
conductors. 
Electrical connector according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the said free ends of the said 

ducts are semi-cylindrical, so that the said common end 
sleeve (43) is cylindrical. 
Electrical connector according to one of 
Claims 3 to 8, characterized in that the said half-ducts 

are joined along a longitudinal junction plane (33, 41) 
formed by interacting longitudinal shoulders (34, 35). 
Electrical connector according to one of 

Claims 4 to 9, characterized in that the free edge (55) 
of the said side walls (52) of the said shells includes, 

plumb with the said slots (54), curved cut-outs (56) of 
shape corresponding to the external shape of the said  

 
ducts (CH). 
Electrical connector according to one of 
Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the said module 

carrier (PM) includes, on the side of the said wiring 
chamber (CC), a frame (50) surrounding the said 

connection face (FB) and serving for the solid fastening 
of the said shells to the said module carrier. 
Electrical connector according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that the said frame (50) includes a 

projecting peripheral rim (62), capable of interacting 
with assembly slots (63) provided in the said shells (C1, 

C2). 
Electrical connector according to one of 
Claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the said shells 

(C1, C2) are joined along a junction plane (PJ) formed by 
interacting longitudinal shoulders (64 to 67). 
Electrical connector according to one of 
Claims 1 to 13, characterized in that at least its joined 

shells are fixed to each other by screws (25).
