<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an implantable electrode system (3) 
intended to be connected at a proximal end (4) to a medical 

apparatus (1) for stimulating living tissue (2), comprising 
a flexible, insulating sleeve, a first conductor (5) running 

in the sleeve from the proximal end to the distal end, a tip 
electrode (8) located at the distal end (7) of the sleeve 

and connected to the first conductor and an indifferent 
electrode with a large electrode surface relative to the tip 

electrode. In order to achieve the largest possible surface 
for the indifferent electrode, the indifferent electrode (9) 

is devised as part of the insulating sleeve on a defined 
section of the insulating sleeve's length between the distal 

end (7) and the proximal end (4). The electrode system's (2) 
flexibility is accordingly retained while an indifferent 

electrode (9) of optional size is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an implantable electrode system 
intended to be connected at a proximal end to a medical 
apparatus for stimulating living tissue, comprising a 
flexible, insulating sleeve, a first conductor running in 
the sleeve from the proximal end to a distal end, a tip 
electrode located at the distal end of the sleeve and 
connected to the first conductor, an indifferent electrode 
with a large electrode surface relative to the tip electrode 
and a second conductor, electrically insulated from the 
first conductor, connected to the indifferent electrode and 
to the medical apparatus, whereby electrical stimulation 
pulses can be emitted by the medical apparatus to the living 
tissue across the tip electrode and the indifferent electrode, 
and electrical signals in the living tissue can be 
sensed between the tip electrode and the indifferent electrode 
by the medical apparatus. In US-A-4-4,387,717 is described a cardiological electrode 
system for stimulating a heart and sensing its activity. The 
system comprises a first conductor which runs through an 
insulating sleeve to a tip electrode placed in the heart. A 
ring electrode is located at a defined distance from the tip 
electrode. The ring electrode is connected to a second conductor. 
The first conductor and the second conductor are 
connected, in turn, to a pacemaker. The ring electrode 
serves as an indifferent electrode and can be placed at a 
distance from the tip electrode so the former is positioned 
inside or outside the heart. Especially in the sensing of cardiac activity, it is important 
that no signals be detected by the indifferent electrode, 
since these signals could interfere with the interpretation 
of signals detected by the tip electrode. The  
 
indifferent electrode should also have a large surface in 
order to reduce the density of current near it, so as to 
prevent needless stimulation of body tissue around the 
indifferent electrode when the medical apparatus emits a 
stimulation pulse across the tip electrode and the indifferent 
electrode. The described ring electrode cannot be 
devised with a large electrode surface, since it is stiff 
and can therefore not be allowed to have a large size, as 
this would make the entire electrode system stiff and 
impossible to implant. A large surface for the indifferent electrode can be 
achieved when e.g. the pacemaker enclosure is devised as the 
indifferent electrode. This has been made, according to the 
aforementioned document, on prior art pacemakers. As a 
result,
