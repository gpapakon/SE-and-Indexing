<ABSTRACT>
A number of new therapeutic uses have been found for 
compounds such as known local anesthetics which are quite 

different from the present therapeutic uses of these 
drugs. The uses include, for example; modulating 

lymphocytes, macrophages and other immune cell functions, 
or PMN functions; inhibiting the cytotoxic effect of 

polymorphonuclear neutrophils leucocytes; providing a 
protective effect on plasma cell membranes; and providing 

an antidote against intoxication by intoxicants. A 
further new use has been found for treating subject 

suffering from neoplastic diseases of diverse cell or 
tissue origin by the administration of an effective 

amount of lidocaine or a related substance. It has been 
found that this new use provides a reduction and/or 

inhibition of tumor growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new therapeutic 
uses for known ester and amide type compounds. Various known drugs, including some which are local 
anesthetics, are synthetic products that can be 
considered as derivatives of a benzoic acid ester or 
amide and a tertiary amine having a hydrocarbon chain 
between these groups. Thus, these molecule have 3 portions: 
a) a lipophilic group, i.e., an arylic or aromatic moiety 
that includes an ester or amide group; b) an hydrophilic group, the amine function; and c) an aliphatic moiety that connects both functions. Local anesthetic drugs are capable of blocking 
nervous conductibility when administered locally. The 
simple direct contact of the drug with nerve tissue 
produces paralysis of the tissue. There are various common types of local anesthesia 
including, for example: 
1) topical or superficial, useful for mucoses; 2) intradermal or subcutaneous anesthesia; 3) regional anesthesia; 4) epidural anesthesia; and 5) rachidial or spinal anesthesy. Those skilled in the art are normally familiar with 
this type of anesthesia. Local anesthetic drugs can act by infiltration in 
the nerves. For acting by blocking the nervous 
conductibility, the drug must reach the nerve fibers 
penetrating the sheets that surround them. In this  
 
sense, the drug must be sufficiently hydrosoluble enough 
to diffuse among tissues and sufficiently liposoluble to 
penetrate across the lipidic layers of the membranes. In 
this way, the velocity of action of the drug depends upon 
its chemical nature, its concentration -a gradient is 
necessary- and of the type of nerve fiber, since in 
myelinated axons, the drug can only penetrate by the 
spaces corresponding to Ranvier nodes. Different 
diameter fibers offer more or less area to absorb the 
drug, which also modifies the velocity of action of the 
drug. Local anesthetics are usually applied in the form of 
salts, specially as hydrochlorides. The salts are 
prepared by the combination of a strong acid with a weak 
alkali. Since they are acidic, with a pH of 4.0 to 6.0, 
they are highly soluble in water and highly ionized. In contact with the alkalinity of the extracellular 
fluids, the tertiary amines are reformed and, since they 
are weakly alkaline and are poorly ionized, this part of 
the molecule can exert its effect. The increasing of the pH of anesthetic drugs 
increase proportionally their potency, and it is 
convenient to increase this pH in those preparations used 
for topical use, since mucous membranes do not have an
