<ABSTRACT>
Fluorinated olefinic monomers, optionally in association 
with non-fluorinated olefins, are (co)polymerized in aqueous 

emulsion in the presence of a hydrophilic solvent and of a 
fluoropolyoxyalkylene having hydrogenated end groups and/or 

hydrogenated repetitive units. In this way it is possible to 
obtain high productivities, close to those obtainable using 

a hydrophilic solvent and a chlorofluorocarbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a (co)polymerization 
process in aqueous emulsion of fluorinated olefinic 
monomers. (Co)polymerization processes of fluorinated olefinic 
monomers in aqueous emulsion are known in the art, wherein a 
couple of solvents, the former hydrophilic, the latter 
hydrophobic, is added to the reaction medium, to increase 
the solubility of the monomers in the reaction medium, thus 
increasing the reaction rate. Alcohols are usually employed 
as hydrophilic solvents, while the hydrophobic solvent is a 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). For instance, in the patent US-A-4,426,501 the 
copolymerization of tetrafluoroethylene with ethylene is 
carried out in aqueous emulsion in the presence of terbutyl 
alcohol as hydrophilic solvent and of 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane 
(CFC 113) as hydrophobic solvent. The use of CFCs as hydrophobic solvents results 
particularly advantageous as they are products having high 
affinity with the fluorinated part of the monomers and, if  
 
appropriately selected, do not act as chain transfer agents 
in the usual polymerization conditions. As well known, 
however, the CFCs deplete the ozone layer of the atmosphere, 
therefore in a few years they will have to be completely 
replaced by products with a low ODP (Ozone Depletion 
Potential). The Applicant has now surprisingly found that, using 
fluoropolyoxyalkylenes having hydrogenated end groups and/or 
hydrogenated repetitive units as hydrophobic solvents in 
copolymerization processes of fluorinated olefinic monomers 
in aqueous emulsion, it is possible to obtain high 
productivities, close to those obtainable with CFCs, 
without, however, causing environmental pollution problems, 
since they are products with a very low ODP. Such a result is particularly surprising since, on the 
basis of the experimentation carried out by the Applicant, 
the use of perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes instead of CFCs gives 
unsatisfactory results, with low productivities, slightly 
higher than those obtainable, in the same conditions, 
without the addition of the solvent couple. Moreover, the perfluoropolyoxyalylenes having 
hydrogenated end groups and/or hydrogenated repetitive 
units, as hereinafter defined, do not cause undesired chain  
 
transfer effects, either at high polymerization temperatures 
(50-100°C), or, even less, when operating at low 
temperatures, as for instance in the case of the preparation 
of HALAR(R) (ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer), 
which is usually polymerized at 10-20°C. Object of the
