<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic polyurethane having a number-average molecular weight of 30,000 to 200,000 and a gel content of 5 wt.% 
or less and basically composed of a polytetramethylene carbonate diol component with a number-average molecular weight of 

500 to 10,000 and an aliphatic diisocyanate component. It is prepared by the chain extension of a prepolymer (A) represented by 
general formula (A) with a chain extender having an active hydrogen atom selected from the group consisting of diols with a molecular 

weight of 300 or less, diamines with a molecular weight of 300 or less, hydrazine and water. In formula (A), X represents 
(a) (wherein the average of m-number is 3 to 43; Y represents the residue of an aliphatic diisocyanate; and the average of n-number 

is 1 to 50. The polyurethane is excellent in the resistances to light, hydrolysis, oleic acid and alcohol. Hence it can be advantageously 
used in such applications as coating composition, and laminated synthetic leather or impregnated composite artificial 

leather made by treating a base material with this composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic 
polyurethane. More particularly, the present invention 
is concerned with a novel thermoplastic polyurethane, 
derived from a polytetramethylene carbonate diol, which 
has excellent resistance to light, oleic acid, hydrolysis 
and alcohol, so that it is useful as a coating 
material, an adhesive, a molding latex material and the 
like. The present invention is also concerned with a 
coating composition comprising the thermoplastic polyurethane 
dissolved in an organic solvent therefor, and 
further concerned with a laminate synthetic leather and 
an impregnation composite artificial leather which are 
obtained by processing a fibrous substrate with the 
coating composition, the leathers exhibiting the 
above-mentioned excellent resistance properties. 
Moreover, the present invention is concerned with a 
novel process for preparing a polytetramethylene carbonate 
diol which is to be used for preparing such an 
excellent thermoplastic polyurethane. A thermoplastic polyurethane has been appreciated  
 
for its excellent properties, such as high toughness, 
and high resistance to oil and abrasion, etc. The 
marketability thereof is increasing. However, conventional 
thermoplastic polyurethanes have drawbacks in 
that they do not exhibit satisfactory resistance to 
light, so that they are likely to suffer from being 
yellowed when used for a prolonged period of time. For 
example, in the use of molded polyurethane products as 
articles having a nature of fashion, such as watchbands 
and the like, the discoloration to yellow is a serious 
problem. For alleviating this problem of the discoloration 
occurring with a lapse of time, many of such 
articles have generally been produced in black color. 
Further, it has recently been found that when a thermoplastic 
polyurethane is used as a material for producing 
articles which are used in direct contact with 
human skin, such as watchbands, the polyurethane is 
deteriorated due to the action of oleic acid which is a 
sebum component contained in sweat. Therefore, it has 
been recognized that the resistance to oleic acid is an 
important property for polyurethanes to be used as 
materials for such articles. Other examples of such 
articles include automobile parts, such as a steering 
wheel, gear shift lever and the like. Furthermore, a polyurethane type coating composition  
 
has been appreciated in the field of leathers, 
such as a laminate synthetic leather and an impregnation 
composite artificial leather, with
