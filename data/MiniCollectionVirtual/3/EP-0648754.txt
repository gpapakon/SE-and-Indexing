<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of a triazine compound of the formula   
<
IMAGE
>
  characterised in that a dihydrotriazine compound of the formula 
<
IMAGE
>
 is converted to the compound of the formula (1) using a compound known as a reducing agent, where in the formulae (1) and (2
>
 R1, R2 and R3 independently of one another are hydrogen, halogen, C1-C8-alkyl, C1-C8-alkoxy or -C IDENTICAL N. The triazines prepared by the process according to the invention are suitable as UV absorbers for organic materials, in particular polyester fibre materials, or as starting compounds for the preparation of UV absorbers.
