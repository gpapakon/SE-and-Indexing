<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) comprises a housing (12), a shaft 
(18) rotatably mounted in the housing (12), a sleeve (32) 

around the shaft (18), and a nut (45) for threaded 
engagement with an end (31) of the shaft (18) to define with 

the sleeve (32) a flange lock. Drive means (14, 16) rotates 
the shaft (18). The sleeve (32) is automatically prevented 

from rotating with the shaft (18) when the drive means (14, 
16) is reversed, such that the nut (45) unscrews from the 

end (31) of the shaft (19) to release the flange lock. The 
sleeve (32) is automatically prevented from rotating with 

the shaft (18) by virtue of a ratchet plate (42) fixed to 
the housing (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices, such as angle 
grinders, which incorporate a drive means and a flange lock 
for receiving a flange of an article to be driven. Angle grinders, which require a flange lock to be 
released manually whenever an abrasive disc is to be 
replaced, are well known. Such angle grinders have either 
in-built motors or facilities for attachment to an external 
drive. The drive is transferred to the abrasive disc via a 
rotatable shaft. During release of the flange lock at the 
end of the shaft, a manually operated abutment is sometimes 
employed to prevent rotation of the shaft and hence the 
abrasive disc. This facilitates unscrewing of a nut, at the 
end of the shaft, which forms part of the flange lock and 
holds the abrasive disc on the end of the shaft. Although manual release of a flange lock is 
acceptable, it is not ideal. Hence, angle grinders have 
been developed which use the powered drive of the angle 
grinder to assist in releasing the flange lock. Such an 
angle grinder is described in EP-A-0235598. In this prior 
art device, an abrasive disc is clamped between a nut and a 
sleeve mounted on a spindle of the angle grinder. When it 
is desired to undo the nut, a knob must be depressed which 
serves to lock the spindle with respect of the sleeve. 
Then, when the motor acts to drive the crown wheel, and 
hence the sleeve, the nut is unscrewed from the threaded 
portion of the spindle, thereby facilitating removal and 
replacement of the abrasive disc. Although the angle grinder of EP-A-0235598 is an 
improvement over the more basic prior art angle grinders, 
the present invention provides a device which automatically 
releases the flange lock without the need for depressing a 
knob, as in EP-A-0235598. Moreover, unless the motor has 
sufficient torque to overcome the resistance to unscrewing 
of the nut from a standing start, the nut cannot be undone. 
The present invention further provides a novel way of  
 
improving release of the flange lock simply by controlling 
the nature of the drive from the drive means. With the foregoing in mind, a device according to 
the present invention comprises a housing, a shaft rotatably 
mounted in the housing, a sleeve around the shaft, a nut for 
threaded engagement with an end of the shaft to define with 
the sleeve a flange lock and drive means for rotating the 
shaft, wherein the sleeve is automatically prevented from 
rotating with the shaft when the drive means is reversed 
such that the nut unscrews from the end of the shaft
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device comprising a housing, a shaft 
rotatably mounted in the housing, a sleeve around the shaft, 

a nut for threaded engagement with an end of the shaft to 
define with the sleeve a flange lock and drive means for 

rotating the shaft, wherein the sleeve is automatically 
prevented from rotating with the shaft when the drive means 

is reversed such that the nut unscrews from the end of the 
shaft to release the flange lock. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
sleeve includes means biased into contact with the housing 

to prevent rotation of the sleeve when the drive means is 
reversed. 
A device as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the 
biased means comprise balls urged towards the housing by 

springs in blind bores of the sleeve. 
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the housing includes a ratchet plate against which 

the sleeve bears, the ratchet plate being shaped to allow 
rotation of the sleeve when the shaft is being driven in the 

forward direction and to act as an abutment for the sleeve 
when the drive means is reversed. 
A device as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the 
ratchet plate includes recesses which each gradually deepen 

towards an end wall, which acts as the abutment. 
A device as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the 
ratchet plate includes four recesses, each recess being 

tear-shaped and lying on the circumference of a circle 
having its centre on the axis of the shaft. 
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the drive means provides a pulsed drive whenever it 

is reversed. 
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the drive means can be locked to prevent rotation of 

the shaft when the nut is to be manually unscrewed. 
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
which is an angle grinder, the flange lock being used to 

grip an abrasive disc. 
A device comprising a housing, a shaft 
rotatably mounted in the housing, a sleeve around the shaft, 

a nut for engaging an end of the shaft to define with the 
sleeve a flange lock and drive means for rotating the shaft 

or the sleeve during normal operation of the device, wherein 
when the drive means is reversed to loosen the nut on the 

shaft the drive means provides a pulsed drive to facilitate 
release of the nut. 
A device as claimed in Claim 10, wherein the 
drive means drives the shaft, and the sleeve either follows 

the shaft, during normal operation of the device, or is 
automatically held by interaction with the housing when the 

drive means is reversed.
