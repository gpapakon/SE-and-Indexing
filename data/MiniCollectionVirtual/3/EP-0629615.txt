<ABSTRACT>
The present patent application discloses compounds having the formula 

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof
 

wherein
 

R²¹ and R²² each independently are alkyl; and
 

R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R¹¹, R¹², R¹³, and R¹⁴ each independently are hydrogen, halogen, CF₃, 
CN, or NO₂. 
The compounds are useful as in vivo active glutamate antagonists.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel excitatory amino acid antagonists, including
glutamate antagonists, a method of treatment therewith, pharmaceutical
compositions comprising the compounds and to a method of preparing the novel
compounds of the invention.It is an object of the present invention to provide novel excitatory amino acid
antagonists, including glutamate and/or aspartate antagonists which are useful in the
treatment of disorders or diseases of a living animal body, including a human, and
especially in the treatment of disorders or diseases which are responsive to the
antagonization of glutamate and /or aspartate of such a living animal body.Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of treating disorders or
diseases of a living animal body, including a human, responsive to the
antagonization of glutamate and aspartate which comprises administering to a living
animal body, including a human, in need thereof a compound of the invention.A third object of the present invention is to provide novel pharmaceutical
compositions for the treatment of disorders or diseases of a living animal body,
including a human, responsive to the antagonization of glutamate and aspartate.Other objects will become apparent to any skilled in the art hereinafter.Excessive excitation by neurotransmitters can cause the degeneration and death of
neurons. It is believed that this degeneration is in part mediated by the excitotoxic
actions of the excitatory amino acids (EAA), glutamate and aspartate, at the N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA), the alfa-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole 
propionic acid (AMPA) receptor, the quisqualate receptor and the kainate receptor.
This excitotoxic action is responsible for the loss of neurons in cerebrovascular
disorders such as cerebral ischemia or cerebral infarction resulting from a range of
conditions, such as thromboembolic or haemorrhagic stroke, cerebral vasospasm,
hypoglycaemia, cardiac arrest, status epilepticus, perinatal asphyxia, anoxia such as
from drowning, pulmonary surgery and cerebral trauma as well as lathyrism,
Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases.The compounds of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of
schizophrenia, Parkinsonism, epilepsy, anxiety, pain and drug addiction.Most, if not all antagonists of the excitatory amino acids, including glutamate, as well
as glutamate antagonists at the AMPA and/or kainate receptors have demonstrated
limited, but still significant in vivo activity, for example as demonstrated by their
