<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a solar absorber having a pipe (2) through which fluid flows and which is fastened to an absorber plate (1) by means of at least two holding jaws (3a, 3b) arranged at a distance from one another on the absorber plate (1), the wall (2a) of the pipe (2), which is originally round, elliptical or pear-shaped in cross-section, bearing snugly and substantially positively against the working flanks (5a, 5b) of the holding jaws (3a, 3b), the cross-section of the pipe (2) has between the holding jaws (3a, 3b) substantially the shape of at least one segment of an ellipse or an oval, whose minor vertices (N1, N2) are arranged in a first plane (E) running between the holding jaws (3a, 3b) and whose major vertices (H1, H2) are arranged in a second plane (R) substantially parallel to the absorber plate or running transversely to the first plane (E). The two holding jaws (3a, 3b) are of different length so that they are able to grip around the pipe (2) over different distances, which substantially simplifies the manufacture of the solar absorber.

characterized in that at least one of the free edges (4a, 4b)
of the jaws (3a, 3b) is directed away from the outer surface 

of the conduit wall (2a), in order to permit the jaw (3a)
and/or the jaw (3b) to be gripped from below.
Solar absorber according to anyone of the preceding
claims,

characterized in that a conduit trench formed in the absorber
panel (1) comprises in the area of the secondary vertex (N1)

which is adjacent the absorber panel (1) a raised convexity
(11) extending along the jaws (3a, 3b).
Method of manufacturing a solar absorber according to
anyone of the preceding claims, said method comprising the

following steps:

laying a conduit (2) of round, elliptic or pear-shaped
cross-section into the gap existing between two jaws (3a, 3b)

mounted in spaced relationship on an absorber panel (1),
