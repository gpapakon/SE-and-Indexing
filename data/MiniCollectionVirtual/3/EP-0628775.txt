<ABSTRACT>
(Low temperature) refrigerated cabinet (1) which is open towards the front and exhibits along the opened front side a cooling air curtain which flows downwards from the top, the main flow of the cooling air curtain (2), which enters the return air duct (4) under the goods space floor (5) through the return air grating (3), preferably 75 to 95% of the cooling air curtain quantity flowing through the return air grating (3), flowing through the return air duct (4) to the fan (6) arranged in the rear space or in the top region of the (low temperature) refrigerated cabinet (1), and a secondary flow of the cooling air curtain (2) flowing through the return air grating (3) into a first auxiliary duct (7), then under the return air duct floor or under the (low temperature) refrigerated cabinet floor (8) and through a second auxiliary duct (9) to the fan (6).

Refrigerator cabinet, in particular low-temperature 
refrigerator cabinet (1), which is open at the front 

and, along the open front side, has a cooling-air curtain 
which flows from the top downwards, characterized in that 


a) a return-air duct (4), through which the main flow 
of the cooling-air curtain, preferably 75 to 95% of 

the quantity of the cooling-air curtain flowing 
through a return-air grid (3), flows to a ventilator 

(6) arranged in the rear chamber or in the cover 
region of the refrigerator cabinet (1), is arranged 

in the base region beneath the base (5) of the goods 
chamber, 
b) a first auxiliary duct (7), through which a 
secondary flow of the cooling-air curtain flowing 

through the return-air grid (3) flows, is arranged 
in its front base region in front of and/or beneath 

the return-air duct (4), and 
c) a second auxiliary duct (9), through which a remaining 
flow of the cooling-air curtain secondary flow 

which has already flowed through the first auxiliary 
duct (7) flows to the ventilator (6), is arranged in 

its rear base region, essentially beneath the 
return-air duct (4).
