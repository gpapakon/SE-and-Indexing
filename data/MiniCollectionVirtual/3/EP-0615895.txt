<ABSTRACT>
A security device (7) for the spare wheel (5) of a vehicle 
comprises a base portion (9) adapted to be seated against one 

side of a wheel. Connector means (15) is carried by the base 
portion (9) and is adapted to pass through an existing aperture 

in the wheel. The connector means has a threaded bore (31) 
therein, into which an attachment bolt (33) is threadable, the 

threaded part of the bolt (33) being adapted to pass through an 
aperture (43) in a suitable part of the vehicle while the bolt 

head (49) is prevented from passing through the aperture (43), 
thereby securing the wheel to that part of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a security device for the spare wheel 
of a vehicle. The majority of motor vehicles today carry one or more spare 
wheels which can be used to replace a damaged road wheel or 
tyre so that, for example, a relatively minor incident, such as 
a puncture, does not cause lengthy delays; the wheel concerned 
can be replaced leaving the damaged wheel to be repaired by 
experts at a more convenient time. However, the space taken up 
by a wheel is relatively large and, in a number of vehicles, 
particularly cars, room is saved by locating the spare wheel 
underneath the boot or equivalent area. The wheel being 
retained in some sort of cage structure which can be lowered, 
for example by a control situated in the boot, so as to permit 
access thereto while maintaining the vehicle ground clearance 
when access is not required. Unfortunately, because the spare wheel is located outside the 
vehicle, it has become a target for thieves. While the cage 
cannot readily be lowered as the controls are located out of 
reach in the boot, nevertheless it can be a reasonably simple 
operation to cut through the cage and/or the lowering mechanism 
using strong bolt cutters, thus rendering the spare wheel 
removable within seconds. The present invention seeks to provide a security device for 
the spare wheel of a vehicle which renders unauthorised access 
thereto much more difficult, if not impossible. According to the invention, there is provided a security device 
for the spare wheel of a vehicle comprising a base portion 
adapted to be seated against one side of a wheel, connector 
means carried by the base portion, adapted to pass through an 
existing aperture in the wheel and having a threaded bore  
 
therein, and an attachment bolt threadable into the threaded 
bore, the threaded part of the bolt being adapted to pass 
through an aperture in a suitable part of the vehicle while the 
bolt head is prevented from passing through the aperture, 
thereby securing the wheel to that part of the vehicle. Preferably the base portion carries at least one projection 
alignable with a second aperture in the spare wheel so as to 
pass thereinto and positively locate the device in set 
relationship to the wheel. The projection may be in the form of a threaded element, 
passing through the wheel aperture, a nut, such as a wing nut, 
being then threaded onto the threaded element so as to 
positively secure the security device to the wheel. Suitably 
the projection comprises a bolt passing through an aperture

A security device (7) for the spare wheel (5) of a vehicle 
comprising a base portion (9) adapted to be seated against one 

side of a wheel (5), connector means (15) carried by the base 
portion (9), adapted to pass through an existing aperture in 

the wheel (5) and having a threaded bore (31) therein, and an 

attachment bolt (33) threadable into the threaded bore (31), 
the threaded part of the bolt (33) being adapted to pass 

through an aperture (43) in a suitable part of the vehicle 
while the bolt head (49) is prevented from passing through the 

aperture (43), thereby securing the wheel to that part of the 
vehicle. 
A security device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the base 
portion (9) carries at least one projection (25) alignable with 

a second aperture in the spare wheel (5) so as to pass 
thereinto and positively locate the device (7) in set 

relationship to the wheel (5). 
A security device as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
projection (25) is in the form of a threaded element, passing 

through the second wheel aperture , a nut (27) being then 
threaded onto the threaded element so as to positively secure 

the security device (7) to the wheel (5). 
A security device as claimed in claim 3, wherein the nut 
(27) is a wing nut. 
A security device as claimed in claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein the 
projection (25) comprises a bolt passing through an aperture 

(23) in the base portion (9). 
A security device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the connector means (15) comprises a spigot projecting from the 

 
base portion (9) and having a threaded bore (31) at its free 

end. 
A security device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
a plate (45) is provided for seating against the interior of a 

part of the vehicle to the exterior of which the wheel (5) is 
to be attached, the plate (45) being apertured for the passage 

of the attachment bolt (33).
