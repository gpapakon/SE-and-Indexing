<ABSTRACT>
A scanner is so arranged that a quantity of light 
reaching a CCD sensor can be kept constant with a change in 

reading position. In case a light source (3) and a reading 
optical unit (4) are driven independent of each other, 

variations in feed amount inevitably occur. To deal with it, a 
test chart of a specified length is first read to measure 

moving amounts of the light source (3) and the reading optical 
unit (4). Then, the reading optical unit (4) is moved by a 

predetermined amount. The light source (3) is moved as 
effecting a correction based on the moving amounts initially 

measured. Then, a one-line reading process is carried out to 
scan an image on a document.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanner using a
linear CCD sensor. More particularly, the invention relates to
a scanner which is adjusted in feed amount to stabilize a
quantity of light during scan.Scanners are widely used these days as means for
inputting document or graphic data into a computer, or as input
means for digital copier or facsimile device.A scanner is operated in such a manner that strong light
from a light source is let to impinge on a surface of document
to be read and that reflected light from the document is guided
through an optical system to form an image on an image sensor.
The image sensor reads the image while photoelectrically
converting an optical signal into an electric signal of a
voltage level proportional to the intensity of reflected light,
that is, the density of document in the unit of pixel. The
electric signal is amplified and subjected to analog-to-digital
conversion to obtain digital data. The digital data is
transferred to a host system.A most popularly used image sensor is a linear CCD
sensor in which pixels are aligned on a line, which can read
image information while scanning the document by a mechanical 
unit.Fig. 5 is a block diagram to show a CCD sensor used in a
scanner. In Fig. 5, S1, S2 ..., SN designate light receiving
elements (photodiodes), SR1, SR2 ..., SRN analog shift
registers (CCD) for shifting out analog outputs from the light
receiving elements, and BUFFER an output buffer. Also, SH
represents a start pulse for starting a shift operation of the
shift registers, 1, 2 shift register transfer clocks, R a
reset pulse, and CCDOUT a CCD output.Fig. 6 is a timing chart to show timings of the drive
signals SH, 1, R to the CCD sensor and CCDOUT as CCD output.
Voltages generated in the light receiving elements S1, S2, ...,
SN are transferred to the analog shift registers SR1, SR2, ...,
SRN, respectively, and are successively shifted in synchronism
with the transfer clocks 1, 2 to be output one by one from an
output terminal of the shift registers.Fig. 2 shows a general structure of scanner. The
scanner as shown is of a reflection read-transmission read
changeover type. Such a scanner is also disclosed in US-A-4 989 099.The scanner of fig. 2 is provided with a scattering plate 1 on
which a document (not shown) is placed, a glass table 2 for
holding the scattering plate 1, a light source 3 located
underneath the glass table 2, a transmission reading (TR)
optical unit 4 located over the scattering plate 1, a TR
optical unit sensor 8 for determining
