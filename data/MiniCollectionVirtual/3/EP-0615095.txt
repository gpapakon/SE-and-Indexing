<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automatic firing unit (1) for driving a blower (3), having a blower drive (2) and a fuel pump (5) with a fuel pump drive (4). The automatic firing unit (1) has a programmer (20) which controls and monitors a start-up process and continuing operation. Blower (3) and fuel pump (5) are controlled for each working point in accordance with the data stored in a desired data memory (22). According to the invention, in this process the desired value for the blower drive (2) is corrected in accordance with a prescribed algorithm by using the actual supply air temperature measured by means of a supply air temperature sensor (30). The invention permits the pollutant emissions of a burner which is controlled by the automatic firing unit (1) to be further reduced.

<CLAIMS>
A burner regulator (1) for actuating a blower (3) having a blower 
drive (2) and a fuel pump (5) having a fuel pump drive (4), wherein the 

burner regulator (1) has a control input (13) serving for switching on and 
off and for output presetting, a reference data memory (22) for reference 

values associated with individual outputs for the operation of units for 
air amount and fuel amount control purposes, an interface (29) for the 

connection of a feed air temperature sensor (30) for correction of the 
reference value of the air amount control, and a programmer (20) which 

controls and monitors continuous operation of a burner operated with 
liquid fuel in a low-output to medium-output heating installation, 

characterised in that 

a) the programmer (20) controls and monitors a start-up procedure, 
b) the reference data memory (22) includes measurement value 
quartets, wherein each measurement value quartet comprises: 


a burner output, 
a reference value associated with said burner output for the speed 
of rotation of the fuel pump drive (4), 
a reference value associated with said burner output for the speed 
of rotation of the blower drive (2), and 
a value for the feed air temperature at which the above-mentioned 
speed of rotation of the blower drive (2) is valid, 
c) the programmer (10) corrects the reference value coming from the 
reference data memory (22) in respect of the speed of rotation of the 

blower drive (2), on the basis of a predetermined algorithm in accordance 
with the feed air temperature stored in the reference data memory (22) and 

the current temperature which is ascertained by the feed air temperature 
sensor (30), 
d) the blower drive (2) is actuated in accordance with said corrected 
reference value, 
e) the burner regulator (1) has a reference value generator (22) 
activatable by an operating mode switch (28), and  

 
f) the operating mode switch (28) has two possible positions, namely 
g) a first position 'RUN' in which operation of the conmbustion 
arrangement governed by the burner regulator (1) is controlled b
y the 
programmer (20) in accordance with the data stored in the reference data 

memory (22), and 
h) a second position 'SET' in which the reference value generator 
(27), taking into account measurement data of an exhaust gas probe (26) 

connected to an interface (25), ascertains reference values for the units 
for air amount and fuel amount control and together with the measurement 

value of the feed air temperature writes same into the reference data 
memory (22). 
A burner regulator (1) according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the operating mode switch (28) is automatically controllable into the 

position 'SET' by a signal from the exhaust gas probe (26), which occurs 
at the interface (25). 
A burner regulator (1) according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the operating mode switch (28) is controllable into 

the position 'SET' by the programmer (20). 
A burner regulator (1) according to one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the reference value generator (27) automatically 

successively goes to different predetermined working points. 
A burner regulator (1) according to claim 4 characterised in that 
the number of the predetermined working points is limited to three, 

wherein a first working point applies for a minimum output N
min
, a second 
working point applies for a medium output N
mittel
 and a third working 
point applies for a maximum output N
max
, and that the reference value 
generator (27) automatically moves to further working points between said 

predetermined working points if the three working points do not 
approximately form a straight line.
