<ABSTRACT>
A container comprising a side wall or walls, a base and means for sealing the container; the said base including a standing ring on which the container is adapted to stand and a diaphragm portion which extends from the inner edge of the standing ring thus forming a central portion of the base of the container; said diaphragm being adapted to axially deform by bowing either inwardly or outwardly preferentially to the side wall or walls so to accommodate changes in pressure in the container wherein the portion of the diaphragm adjacent to and extending from the inner edge of the standing ring is substantially continuous.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTAINERThis patent application relates to plastic containers and in particular plastic containers which undergo a change in internal pressure between filling and use by the consumer.The processes used in packaging materials in containers and the nature of the materials themselves often place severe requirements on the structure and rigidity of containers.For example in hot filling containers with food products the food is typically at a temperature of between 80 to 95Â°C when introduced into the container. If the container is sealed shortly thereafter a significant vacuum within the container is created on cooling. If the container is not sufficiently strong, side wall panelling can result giving the container an unattractive appearance. In many cases rupturing can occur resulting in spoiling of the food and possible health complications for the consumer.In consequence of the above it has generally been necessary to use containers of sufficient rigidity to withstand pressure reduction.The same difficulties can be caused by volatile materials which lead to an increase in pressure. However, the invention will be discussed with reference mainly to hot fill containers although the invention is not restricted thereto.In packaging of foodstuffs it is preferable to leave an air space for the convenience of the end user. The vacuum generated in this air space resulting from cooling after hot filling exacerbates the problems of container failure or side wall panelling.It is an object of the present invention to provide a plastics container which is suitable for containing foodstuffs which are introduced whilst hot, sealed and thereafter cooled without significant side wall deformation. It is also an object of the invention to provide a plastics container suitable for retort. 

 According to the present invention there is provided a container comprising a side wall or walls, a base and means for sealing the container; the said base including a standing ring on which the container is adapted to stand and a diaphragm portion which extends from the inner edge of the^ standing ring across the base of the container and which is adapted to axially deform by bowing either inwardly or outwardly preferentially to the side wall or walls so to accommodate changes in pressure in the container wherein the portion of the diaphragm adjacent to and extending from the inner edge of the standing ring is substantially continuous.The portion of the diaphragm adjacent to the inner edge of the standing ring should be continuous so

Claims
1. A container comprising a side wall or walls, a base and means for sealing the container; the said base including a standing ring on which the container is adapted to stand and a diaphragm portion which extends from the inner edge of the standing ring thus forming a central portion of the base of the container; said diaphragm being adapted to axially deform by bowing either inwardly or outwardly preferentially to the side wall or walls so to accommodate changes in pressure in the container wherein the portion of the diaphragm adjacent to and extending from the inner edge of the standing ring is substantially continuous. 2. A container as claimed in claim 1 wherein the portion of the diaphragm adjacent to the inner edge of the standing ring does not comprise any grooves, corrugations or other disruptions in its profile.
3. A container as claimed in either one of claims 1 or 2 wherein the diaphragm portion is uniformly thinner than the container side wall or walls.
4. A container as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the side walls are reinforced by internal ribbing. 5. A container as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the diaphragm portion is connected to the inner edge of the standing ring in such manner that inward or outward bowing of the diaphragm will not disrupt the stability of the container. 6. A container as claimed in claim 5 wherein the diaphragm portion is connected to the inner edge of the standing ring by an upwardly arched portion.
7. A container as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the diaphragm portion of the base comprises a portion which is less than 80% of the minimum thickness of the side wall.
8. A container as claimed in claim 7 wherein the diaphragm portion of the base comprises a portion which is between 50 to 80% of the minimum thickness of the side 


wal l .
9. A container as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the base diameter of the container is less than the top diameter and the base diameter to top diameter ratio is in the range of from 0.65 to 1.0.
10. A container as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the side wall thickness ranges between 0.35 to 0.70 mm and the ratio of base wall to side wall thickness is in the range of 0.5 to 0.75. 11. A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10 wherein the thickness of the side wall or walls is between 0.70 to 1.0 mm and the ratio of the base wall to the side wall thicknesses is in the range of between 0.3 to 0.5.
12. A container as claimed in any one of the preceding claims comprising a plurality of reinforcing ribs in the standing ring.
13. A container as claimed in claim 12 wherein each of the said ribs extend from the side wall of the container toward the centre of the base across at least the outermost portion of the standing ring.
14. A container as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the standing ring comprises an essentially planar surface and has a width in the range of between 10 to 40% of the base radius. 15. A container substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to what is shown in any one of Figures 1 to 3.
