<ABSTRACT>
A modular jack type electrical connector (10) 
includes a dielectric housing (12) defining a plug-receiving 

cavity (20) open at one end (24) of the housing. 
A plurality of terminals (14) are mounted on the housing 

with contact portions (28) extending into the cavity. A 
shunt (16) bridges at least a pair of the terminals. A 

passive electrical component (18) is coupled directly to 
the shunt on the connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a modular jack
type electrical connector according to the preamble of
claim 1.Document EP-A-0 033 794 discloses an electrical
connector of the kind referred-to above. A U-shaped
commoning member having two prongs formed integrally
therewith is mounted in the connector housing and the prongs
project into selected ones of spaces within a cavity in the
housing. After the assembling of terminals into the cavity,
an end portion of each terminal is received in a respective
one of the spaces. Thereby, selected ones of the end
portions engage the prongs so that the commoning member
electrically connects a selected terminal pair. There is no
space for the commoning members to include a resistor.Document EP-A-0.362.943 discloses a switching
arrangement for forming an electric connection between two
particular non-selectable terminals of a jack type
connector. A one-part resistor having two opposite ends is
mounted within the connector housing. The one end is coupled
to the first terminal and the opposite end is coupled to a
switching plate. The second terminal has to be provided with
an additional movable connection leg which contacts the
swiching plate when no plug is inserted into the jack. This
arrangement is very complex.There are a variety of other known shunted electrical
connectors, including connectors of the modular jack type,
wherein selected different terminals of the connector are
shunted or shorted for various purposes. Examples of such
connectors are shown in US-A-4.863.3935, US-A-4.874.333,
US-A-4.952.170. All of these patents show one form or
another of a modular jack type connector which includes such
components as shorting elements, bridging cords, shunting
strips and the like to shunt or short selective different
terminals of the connectors, particularly when the
connectors are not receiving a mating connector plug. For
instance, the shunting elements may be used to maintain line
continuity when no plug is inserted into the jack.Generally, electrical connectors of the character 
described above include spring beam contacts which protrude
from a portion of the jack housing into the receiving cavity
of the jack. The contacts or terminals may be separated from
each other by molded walls of the jack. The terminals
include terminal portions, usually in the form of terminal
pins, for mating with the terminals of a complementary
electrical component. For instance, the terminal pins may
form solder tails for insertion into holes in a printed
circuit board. In some
