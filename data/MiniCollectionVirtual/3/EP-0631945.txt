<ABSTRACT>
It is threaded on the necks (C) of bottles, flasks (F) and 
other containers. It is characterized in that it comprises 

two caplike bodies (1,2) of which one body (1) is larger 
and is attached over the other body (2), which is housed 

inside the larger one and is the one having the inner side 
surface threaded for fitting to the neck (C) of the 

pertinent container (F), said bodies (1, 2) having on one 
of their side contact surfaces at least one projection (3) 

penetrating in a peripheral slot (4) of the other and 
allowing the larger body (1) to rotate about the smaller 

one (2), at the same time preventing separation from the 
latter, which comprises externally an upper chase (8) for 

manipulation, by a key (7) or convenient tool, through an 
upper aperture (5) of the larger body (1). The stopper has 

means (10, 11) for closing the container (F) without the 
need of tools (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a security stopper. This stopper is of the type screwed on to the neck of 
bottles, flasks and other containers, with the peculiarity 
that it cannot be applied thereto or removed therefrom 
without the use of a suitable key or tool. This prevents everyday packaged products, which are 
extremely hazardous when used for other purposes than the 
specific one for which they were designed, from being 
accessible to children and other persons unaware of such 
hazard and the consequences of misuse thereof, although the 
stopper may also obviously be used for containers whose 
content the user does not wish to share without his 
knowledge. To this end, the stopper of the invention comprises two 
caplike bodies, one of which is larger and is unreleasably 
engaged on the other due, at least, to a suitably shaped 
projection formed on one of the two side contact surfaces 
of said bodies and which is inserted in a peripheral groove 
of the other, while at the same time the larger body is 
allowed freely to rotate about the smaller one. The smaller body is the one screwed on the neck of the 
pertinent container, being manipulated for such purpose by 
a key or tool, which will be inserted in an external upper 
chase in said smaller body through an upper aperture of the 
larger body. Advantageously the stopper comprises a shoulder formed on 
one of the contact surfaces between the two bodies of the 
stopper and which, when the latter is rotated for screwing 
on the container neck, will abut a stop formed on the 
contact surface between the two bodies opposite the one 
surface, whereby the outer body will pull along the inner 
one to enable it to be screwed up without the aid of the 
key or tool.  On the contrary, it will still be impossible to unscrew 
the stopper from the container neck unless the said key or 
tool is used, because it has been contemplated that at 
least the shoulder shall comprise, in the area where it 
contacts the stop in said unscrewing action, a recess 
allowing it to slide over said stop without pulling the 
inner body of the stopper along with the outer one. All of this has been implemented to avoid the bottle 
being left open and within reach of children and other 
persons who may misuse the contents thereof, exposing 
themselves to the risks which it was intended to avoid, 
because of the loss of the tool or key for the stopper 
after the pertinent container has been opened. Obviously, the said shoulder and stop may be disposed 
both on the upper contact surfaces

<CLAIMS>
1.- A security stopper, of the type screwed on the necks 
(C) of bottles, flasks (F) and other containers, 

characterized in that it comprises two caplike bodies (1,2) 
of which one body (1) is larger and is attached over the 

other body (2), which is housed inside the larger one (1) 
and is the one having the inner side surface threaded for 

fitting to the neck (C) of the pertinent container (F), 
said bodies having on one of their side contact surfaces at 

least one projection (3) which is inserted in a peripheral 
slot (4) of the other and allows the larger body (1) to 

rotate about the smaller one (2), while at the same time 
preventing separation therefrom, which body comprises 

externally an upper chase (8) for manipulation, by a key 
(7) or convenient tool, through an upper aperture (5) of 

the larger body (1). 
2.- The security stopper of claim 1, wherein one (1) of 
said two bodies (1, 2) has at least one shoulder (10, 10a) 

in at least one of its contact surfaces with the other 
which, by operation on the outer body (1) of the stopper to 

screw it on the neck (C) of the container (F), will abut 
the corresponding stop (11, 11'a) provided on the contact 

surface of the other body (2) facing the former, with the 
said outer body (1) pulling the inner body (2) with the 

said action alone, whereby the key (7) or tool will not be 
required, which will still be necessary to unscrew the 

stopper, since at least the shoulder (10, 10a) has, for 
this action, a recess (10') in the area of contact with the 

stopper (11) causing it to slide thereover, preventing the 
said pulling along and consequent unscrewing of the 

stopper. 
3.- The security stopper of claim 2, wherein said stop 
(11) is located within a peripheral channel (12) on the 

corresponding contact surface of one (2) of the two bodies 
(1, 2) forming the stopper, with the shoulder (10) of the 

 
contact surface of the other body (1) facing it inserted in 

the said slot (12), which aids for a perfect pull of the 
inner body (2) of the stopper by the outer body (1) by 

means of said stop (11) and shoulder (10). 
4.- The security stopper of claim 2, wherein the shoulder 
(10a) and the stop (11'a) are comprised in the peripheral 

slot (4) and the corresponding projection (3) penetrating 
therein of the side contact surfaces between the two bodies 

(1, 2) forming the stopper to prevent one body from being 
separated from the other.
