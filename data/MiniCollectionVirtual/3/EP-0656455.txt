<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a locking device (10) for a leaf of a motor vehicle, particularly for a boot lid, characterised in that it comprises:   - a rotary actuating member (96) connected to a linkage for actuating a lock of the leaf and capable of pivoting between two angular end positions for locking and unlocking the leaf in the closed position; - a rotor (20) for manually driving the actuating member in rotation between its two end positions; - a motorised device for driving the rotary actuating member in rotation between its two end positions; and - retractable blocking means (58) which immobilise the rotary actuating member (96) in terms of rotation in the end locking position when the latter is driven in rotation into this position by the manual drive rotor (20) and the release of which is controlled by driving the manual drive rotor (20) in rotation.

A locking device (10) for the door of a motor
vehicle boot, characterised in that it includes:


a rotary actuating member (96) coupled to a linkage
for actuating a lock of the door and arranged to pivot

between two angular end positions for locking and
unlocking the door in its closed position;
a rotor (20) for manually driving the actuating
member in rotation between its two end positions;
a motorised device for driving the rotary actuating
member in rotation between its two end positions; and
retractable stop means (58) which immobilise the
rotary actuating member (96) in its locking end

position against rotation when the latter is driven in
rotation into that position by the manual driving rotor

(20), release of the stop means being controlled by the
rotary driving of the manual driving rotor (20).
A locking device according to Claim 1,

characterised in that it includes a stator (12) in
which the rotary actuating member (96) and the manual

driving member (20) are mounted for rotation about a
common axis (X-X), in that the stop means (58) comprise

a catch (58) mounted for tilting movement in the stator
(12) about a pivot (56), the axis of which is parallel

to the axis of rotation of the manual driving rotor
(20), between a rest position towards which it is

biased elastically, and a stop position in which a stop 
finger (82) of the catch (58) cooperates with a

circular edge (116) of the rotary actuating member
having a stop recess (118), and in that the stop catch

(58) includes an arm (62) for controlling its tilting
movement towards its stop position, which is arranged

to cooperate with a control finger (44) of the manual
driving member (20) when the latter is rotated in the

direction corresponding to locking of the door.
A locking device according to Claim 2,

characterised in that the stop catch (58) is biased
elastically towards its stop position, and in that it

includes an arm (64) for controlling its tilting
movement towards its rest position, which is arranged

to cooperate with the control finger (44) of the manual
driving member (20) when the latter is rotated in the

direction corresponding to locking of the door.
A locking device according to Claim 3,

characterised in that it includes a bi-stable spring
(76) for biasing the stop catch (58) towards its rest

and stop positions.
A locking device according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the rotary

actuating member (96) is arranged to pivot with respect
to the manual driving rotor (20) through an angular

course of travel which is substantially equal to the
amount of its rotation between its angular end

positions.
A locking device according to Claim 5,

characterised in that the manual driving rotor (20)
includes a radial drive pin (36) which is received in a

slot (126) formed in the rotary actuating member (96, 
114), and which defines an angular course of travel

substantially equal in length to the angular travel
described by the said member (96) between its angular

end positions.
A locking device according to any one of Claims 2
to 6, characterised in that the rotary actuating member

(96) is biased axially towards its two angular end
positions by a bi-stable return spring (132) interposed

between the stator (12) and the rotary actuating member
(96), and in that the stator (12) includes abutment

means (86, 88) defining the said angular end positions.
A locking device according to any one of Claims 2
to 7, characterised in that the manual actuating rotor

(20) is biased elastically in rotation with respect to
the stator (12), towards a rest position in which the

control finger (44) is not acting on the stop catch
(58).
A locking device according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that it includes a

lock, the barrel of which is coupled in rotation with
the manual driving rotor (20).
