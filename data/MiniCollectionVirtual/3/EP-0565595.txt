<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a dispenser for use 
with dishwashing machines and more particularly to a 
dispenser containing a solid detergent product which is 
disposable after multiple dishwashing cycles. Food processing, preparation, serving and consumption 
produces large quantities of reusable soiled dishes, table 
ware, pots and pans, and other equipment often referred to 
as utensils. Before such items can be reused, they must be 
washed and usually dried. Industrial and institutional 
cleaning of such goods is generally done in machine washing 
equipment of various types. Essentially all washing 
machines employ an aqueous detergent solution to clean the 
soiled dishes and other food handling equipment. The 
aqueous detergent solution is generally sprayed onto the 
soiled items in an enclosed chamber so that both the 
solubilizing action of the solution and the mechanical 
action of the spray against the items combine to clean the 
soiled dishes and the like. Restaurants and institutions already have available 
several types of detergent products for use in dishwashing 
machines, including granular compositions, liquids, and 
solid bricks or blocks. Some of these are directly 
introduced into the machine; these in-machine dispensers 
are particularly useful with relatively small machines. In 
other cases, particularly for large commercial machines, 
the detergent is dispensed automatically by various types 
of feeding equipment. However, the latter dispensers are 
expensive, especially in regard to production and 
maintenance.  
 
More recently, block-formed detergents for domestic and 
institutional dishwashing machines have been developed, 
which have the advantage of being dimensionally stable. 
These detergents are dissolved by simply spraying with 
water, and then are delivered to the wash machine in 
solution. Since institutional detergents often have a high 
caustic alkali content, contact with the skin should be 
avoided. Block-formed detergents are much safer to handle 
and thus also superior in this regard. One type of automatic equipment for producing a 
detergent washing solution from a solid cast detergent 
block is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,569,780 and 
4,569,781. Said U.S. Patents 
describe a detergent container suitable for use in 
automatic detergent dispensers adapted for dispensing 
detergents in block form. A molten detergent is poured 
into the container and allowed to solidify. The detergent 
is subsequently dissolved from the container on contact 
with a stream

<CLAIMS>
A dispenser (10) for dishwashing machine detergent 
(13), including a container (11) which has a bottom wall 

(27), side walls (15, 16, 17) and a top portion, said container 
(11) having a removable lid (12) with a plurality of 

openings (18), wherein a solid composition (13) is provided 
in the container (11), and water dissolves the upper surface 

of said composition (13), characterized in that: the 
dispenser (10) comprises means for removably closing said openings 

in the lid (12), that one (17) of said side walls (15, 16, 
17) has a slot (23) therein for egress of solution, said 

slot (23) being continuous and elongated and having an 
upper end and a lower end, said lower end being proximate 

said bottom wall (27) whereby water and dissolved 
composition drain from said slot (23); and that the dispenser 

(10) further comprises a planar sheet (26) which is 
parallel to one of said side walls (17) and which substantially 

covers said slot (23), said planar sheet (26) being spaced away 
from said slot (23). 
The dispenser according to claim 1, wherein the 
solid detergent composition (13) is a monolithic solid 

formed by casting a liquid detergent composition into the 
container (11) and solidifying it therein. 
The dispenser according to claim 1, wherein the 
container (11) is substantially triangular in shape and 

has three side walls (15, 16, 17), one of which is a 
hypotenuse side wall (17). 
The dispenser according to claim 3, wherein said 
slot (23) of the hypotenuse side wall (17) spans its 

height.  
 
The dispenser according to claim 4, characterised in that 
said planar sheet (26) is interconnected at one end  

 
to said lid (12). 
The dispenser according to claim 1, wherein said 
means removably closing the openings (18) in said lid (12) 

are tabs which cover the openings (18) and are adhered to 
the lid outer surface. 
A method of washing dishes and utensils in a 
dishwashing machine comprising: 


a) placing soiled dishes and utensils in a 
dishwashing machine having a washing chamber (20); 
b) manually grasping a dispenser (10) comprising a container 
(11), provided with side 

walls (15, 16, 17) and a top portion (12) having a 
plurality of openings (18), said openings (18) 

being covered by removable cover means, a solid 
detergent composition (13) being contained within 

said dispenser (10) said dispenser (10) comprising a 
planar sheet (26) which is parallel to one of said 

side walls (17) and which substantially covers 
a slot (23), said planar sheet (26) being spaced away from said 

slot (23), 
c) removing said removable cover means; 
d) placing said dispenser (10) in a dishwashing 
machine; 
e) closing the dishwashing machine and supplying 
washing water to the machine washing chamber (20) 

as a spray so that water enters the openings in 
the top portion of the dispenser (10) and flows downwardly 

in the dispenser (10) around the detergent 
composition (13) and forming a detergent solution 

which flows out of the container (11) and mixes with 
water to form a washing solution; and 
f) recycling the washing solution into washing 
contact with the dishes and utensils to clean 

them. 
The method according to claim 7, wherein the solid 
detergent composition (13) is a monolithic solid formed by 

casting a liquid detergent composition into the container  
 

(11) and solidifying it therein. 
The method according to claim 7, wherein one of 
said side walls (15, 16, 17) has the 

slot (23) therein, said slot (23) being substantially vertical. 
The method according to claim 7, wherein said 
dispenser (10) is placed in a lower corner portion of the 

dishwashing machine.
