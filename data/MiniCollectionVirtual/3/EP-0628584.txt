<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of rigid polyurethane foams by reacting     a) organic and/or modified organic polyisocyanates with b) at least one relatively high-molecular-weight compound containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms, and optionally   c) low-molecular-weight chain extenders and/or crosslinking agents,  in the presence of   d) blowing agents,   e) catalysts and optionally   f) auxiliaries and/or additives, where the relatively high-molecular-weight compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) are polyoxyproylene-polyols and/or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-polyols containing up to 20 % by weight, based on the weight of the alkylene oxide units, of pendant oxyethylene units containing secondary hydroxyl groups, and having a functionality of from 3.8 to 4.1, a hydroxyl number of from 385 to 410 mg of KOH/g, a viscosity of from 1,700 to 2,400 mPas at 25@C, preparable by anionic polymerisation of 1,2-propylene oxide and, where appropriate, ethylene oxide onto an initiator (starter) molecule mixture comprising sucrose, pentaerythritol and diethylene glycol.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of rigid polyurethane 
foams by reacting 


a) organic and/or modified organic polyisocyanates with 
b) at least one compound containing from two to eight-reactive 
hydrogen atoms and having a molecular 

weight of from 300 to 8000, and, if desired, 
c) diols and/or triols having a molecular weight of 
from 60 to 300 
 
in the presence of 


d) blowing agents, 
e) catalysts and, if desired, 
f) assistants and/or additives, 
 
where the compounds (b) containing from two to eight 

reactive hydrogen atoms and having a molecular weight of 
from 300 to 8000 are polyoxypropylene-polyols and/or 

polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-polyols containing up to 
20 % by weight, based on the weight of the alkylene oxide 

units, of pendant oxyethylene units containing secondary 
hydroxyl groups and having a functionality of from 3.8 to 

4.1, a hydroxyl number of from 385 to 410 mg of KOH/g and 
a viscosity of from 1700 to 2400 mPa·s at 25°C, determined 

in accordance with DIN 51550, and which are 
prepared by anionic polymerization of 1,2-propylene oxide 

and, if-desired, ethylene oxide on an initiator molecule 
mixture comprising sucrose, pentaerythritol and 

diethylene glycol. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
initiator molecule mixture comprises, based on the total 

weight of the polyoxyalkylene-polyol, from 12 to 18 % by 
weight of sucrose, from 4 to 7 % by weight of pentaerythritol  

 
and from 8 to 11 % by weight of diethylene 

glycol. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
alkoxide is first formed from pentaerythritol, diethylene 

glycol and the alkaline catalyst with complete removal of 
the water of reaction, the sucrose is then added, the 

mixture is fully homogenized, and only then is the 
resultant initiator mixture reacted with alkylene oxide.
