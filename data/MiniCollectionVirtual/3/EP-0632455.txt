<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are disclosed for minimizing the space required for a disk drive 
housing by mounting a disk drive unit in an enclosure of minimum size, using only a connection on 

one side of the disk drive and a drive belly plate, which is mounted on the bottom side of the disk 
drive, connected to an engaging surface on the bottom or intermediate cross-member of the super-structure, 

whereby the disk drive is held securely. The apparatus may accommodate four 3.5 inch 
form factor full height disk drives or six 3.5 inch form factor one inch high disk drive units. Additional 

space savings in the housing are achieved by the use of a unique electrical-connector attachment 
plate for connecting the cable connector terminals to the housing without the use of the normal 

connectors such as screws, bolts, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the field of computer systems. Specifically, the present
invention relates to mechanisms in which are mounted disk drive units for use as desktop storage
devices.At the present time, price performance competition in the computer industry creates pressure
on product designers to create lower cost systems which include added capability. Added capability
is usually provided through faster processors, expanded memory capacity, and/or increased disk
storage capacity, whereas reduced costs in these areas are typically provided through reduced
manufacturing costs of these devices. However, additional cost reductions are sometimes also obtained
through packaging efficiencies, wherein computer systems become more compact and the
related system units become more densely packed with electronic devices. Moreover, computer users
acceptance of the desktop workstation concept has added to the design pressures to produce
smaller units which are less cumbersome for small work spaces. Having become accustomed to
computer monitors and accessories with small footprints, customers are reluctant to accept new units
with bigger footprints even though the new box might contain added capability.In the prior art,disk drive units have normally been seated within a drive housing with secure
connections at each side of the disk drive unit This is because a disk drive unit, by virtue of the
rotational pressures of the drive mechanism, normally creates vibrational forces in the plane of the
disk when seated in the drive unit. This plane would be the horizontal plane when the disk drive
unit is in the upright position. These vibrational forces are therefore normally dampened by securely
fastening both sides of the drive unit to the housing or to the mounting structure. As a result, the
need to fasten both sides of the drive unit normally requires enough room within the housing to fasten
drive units stacked one on top of another, with room on both sides to insert fasteners (i.e. screws,
bolts, connectors, etc.) to connect the drive unit to the holding structure. Other mounting schemes 
which have permitted two drives to be mounted side by side, include disk drive unit mounting mechanisms
with slide-out arms to which the sides of a drive unit can be fastened, and the drive unit then
inserted into the drive unit holder, with the slide-out arms of the second holder extracted and the
second drive connected to the arms on each side of the drive and the second drive unit then inserted
into the drive
