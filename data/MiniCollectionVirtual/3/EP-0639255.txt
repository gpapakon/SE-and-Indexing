<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a burner according to the preamble of claim 
1. To increase the efficiency of combustion systems and at the same time 
to reduce the emission of pollutants from gas turbine engines and 
furnaces, various improvements for burners have been proposed in the 
past. Moreover, legal requirements on maximum emission limits have 
gone into effect which must be met by the combustion systems. Aside 
from other combustion products, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
are responsible for air pollution. Acting as the nitrogen source in this connection are, on the one hand. 
combustion air in the form of ordinary ambient air with its natural 
nitrogen content, and on the other hand, fuel, containing organically 
bonded nitrogen. In the combustion itself, the formation of nitrogen 
oxides depends heavily, among other things, on the length of time 
spent by the molecular nitrogen in the flame region. The shorter the 
time spent, the fewer the nitrogen oxides formed. Reducing the length 
of time, however, for instance by higher air or fuel influx rates, results 
in more noncombusted fluid compounds appearing in the emissions 
of the burner, causing a reduction in its efficiency. The formation of carbon monoxide goes hand in hand with the formation 
of soot. Carbon monoxide has a high thermic value, which is thus lost 
for purposes of usable combustion.  
 Furthermore, the formation of nitrogen oxide is dependent on the flame 
temperature and increases with a rise in flame temperature. On the 
other hand, an increased flame temperature is desired to obtain a better 
fuel energy yield. In a known burner for an airplane jet engine (DE-OS 30 17 034), in order 
to achieve both low emission of pollutants with fewer nitrogen 
oxides and increased efficiency, the burner head thereof is equipped 
with a concentric outlet arrangement in the form of several concentric, 
individually switchable outlet nozzles, with the fuel and air 
outlet nozzles alternating radially with each other starting from the 
centre of the burner head. Depending on what single outlet nozzle is 
switched on, which depends in turn on the operating conditions, one 
(for idling) or two (for full load) combustion zones result. Hard-to-burn, 
noncombusted gas compounds are expelled with the emissions of 
this known burner and thus substantially lower the energy yield of the 
fuel. Aside from their use in engines, burners are also used in furnaces. 
Here as well, various past improvements have been able to contribute 
to saving

the quantity of feedable low-nitrogen air and/or of fuel feedable via 

the fuel feed nozzle (5) is infinitely variable.
