<ABSTRACT>
Described is a copolymer comprising repeating units derived 
from: 


(i) a monoadduct of isopropenyl-alpha, alpha-dimethylbenzyl 
isocyanate and an amino compound; and 
(ii) an ethylenically unsaturated compound capable of 
copolymerizing with said monoadduct, 
 
as well as a process for producing the same. Such copolymers 

in and of themselves may find use as aminoplast crosslinking 
agents, or can readily be modified thereto. Curable 

compositions can be formulated from the crosslinker alone or 
in combination with polyfunctional active hydrogen compounds, 

which can be cured to produce crosslinked films and objects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to copolymeric aminoplasts
methods of producing same and use of same as e.g.
crosslinking agents particularly in the coating field.To effectively crosslink with a variety of widely available
difunctional materials such as diols, dicarboxylic acids,
dimercaptans, and diamides, a monomeric crosslinking agent is
required to have a functionality effective for crosslinking
of greater than two, and preferably at least 3. In many
cases, however, even trifunctional aminoplast crosslinking
agents do not give rise to sufficient crosslinking density in
cured films or objects due to incomplete reaction of the
functional groups, and as a result, cured films with inferior
physical and resistance properties are obtained.The problem of insufficient crosslinking density may be
overcome by using a higher functional aminoplast crosslinker
such as hexamethoxymethyl melamine. In these cases, however,
the films obtained sometimes have low flexibility due to the
somewhat rigid network produced in the films upon cure.The above-identified problems of insufficient crosslinking of
the low functionality crosslinkers and the low flexibility of
the highly functional crosslinkers may be overcome by using
typically tetrafunctional guanamine-derived aminoplast
crosslinking agents. However, guanamine-derived crosslinkers
are more difficult and more costly to prepare than melaminederived
crosslinkers. Furthermore, some guanamine
crosslinkers such as N,N,N',N'-tetraalkoxymethylbenzoguanamines
may have insufficient
resistance properties for certain applications, and generally
have inferior stability towards the degradative action of
ultraviolet light. It is therefore the object of the present invention to
provide copolymeric aminoplasts useful as crosslinking agents
and a method of producing same, which copolymeric aminoplasts
avoid the above described drawbacks of known products. This
object is solved by the copolymers according to independent
claims 1 and 8, the method according to independent claim 14,
the curable composition according to independent claim 17 and
the method for coating a substrate according to independent
claim 19. Further advantageous features, aspects and details
of the invention are evident from the dependent claims, the
description and examples.This invention relates generally to a novel class of
functional copolymers and derivatives thereof which can be
used as aminoplast crosslinking agents in a variety of
fields, and particularly in the coating field.The present invention, therefore,
