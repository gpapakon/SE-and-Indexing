<ABSTRACT>
A blind of a type that a plurality of slats 3 which are 
aligned vertically are supported by a pair of ladder support 

cords 2 at given intervals, and a front vertical portion 2a and 
a rear vertical portion 2b of the support cord 2 are relatively 

moved up and down, thereby allowing the slats 3 to tilt, a 
lower end of a lifting cord 6 is fixed to the support cord in 

the vicinity of a front edge or a rear edge of a specified one 
of the slats which is determined arbitrarily.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable horizontal 
blind which is called a venetian blind in which a plurality of 
horizontal slats are aligned vertically in parallel with each 
other at given distances, and all the slats are made to rise 
and fall by means of a vertically moving cord to perform the 
open/close operation of the blind. The variable horizontal blind performs the open/close 
operation of the blind by allowing all the slats to go up and 
down by means of the vertically moving cord, and the slats are 
tilted in a state that the blind is closed, that is, the slats 
are shut, thereby making the slats in an open state and in a 
close state to adjust the light shielding. As a means for 
tilting the slats, the slats aligned in the vertical direction 
are supported at given intervals by ladder support cords to 
allow the front and rear vertical portions of the support cords 
to relatively go up and down. In the blind thus organized, all the slats come into 
the open state or in the close state at a stretch by the 
vertically moving operation of the support cords, and therefore 
they could not be partially made in the open state or in the 
close state.  Under such a situation, there has been proposed a blind 
which is more useful by making the upper or lower side of the 
slats in the open or close state (Utility Model Unexamined 
Publication No. Sho 55-116194). This blind is constituted in such a manner that a 
member for picking the vertical portion of a support cord is 
fixed to the vertical portion of the support cord between a 
slat positioned at a desired level and the front or rear side 
edge, thereby bringing the respective side edges of both slats 
in close contact with each other. In the above-mentioned blind, there is a disadvantage 
in that the respective picking members must be attached to each 
of the support cords fixed to the end edge of the slat, and 
even in its operation, because the respective picking members 
must be manipulated individually, the operation takes heavy 
labor. There is also a disadvantage in that when the blind is 
being shut, that is, when the slats are being elevated, the 
picking member becomes obstructive. For that reason, under 
existing circumstances, such blinds have been hardly used. In view of the above problems, an object of the 
invention is to provide a variable horizontal blind which is 
capable of making the upper or lower side of the slats arranged 
toward the vertical direction in an open state or in a close 
state with simple operation.  The

<CLAIMS>
A variable horizontal blind of such a type that 
a plurality of slats which are aligned in a vertical direction 

are supported at given intervals by at least a pair of ladder 
support cords, and a front vertical portion and a rear vertical 

portion of said support cords are relatively moved up and down 
to tilt said slats, characterized in that a lower end of a 

lifting cord is fixed to said support cord in the vicinity of 
a front edge or a rear edge of a specified one of said slats, 

which is determined arbitrarily. 
A variable horizontal blind as claimed in claim 
1, wherein the lower end of said lifting cord is fixed to said 

support cord in the vicinity of the front edge and the rear 
edge of a specified one of said slats, which is determined 

arbitrarily. 
A variable horizontal blind of such a type that 
a plurality of slats which are aligned in a vertical direction 

are supported at given intervals by at least a pair of ladder 
support cords, and a front vertical portion and a rear vertical 

portion of said support cords are relatively moved up and down 
to tilt said slats, characterized in that one end of a lifting 

cord is fixed to an upper box on or in the vicinity of an upper 
end side of any one of a front vertical portion and a rear 

vertical portion of a support cord located on one side in the 
lateral direction among said support cords, cord guides movably 

hook said lifting cord are fitted to each of said support cords 
 

in the vicinity of a front edge and a rear edge of a specified 
one of said slats which are determined arbitrarily
 and to said 
upper box in the vicinity of the upper end side of any one of 

the front vertical portion and the rear vertical portion of 
said support cord on the other side in the lateral direction, 

and said lifting cord is successively hooked on from said cord 
guides fitted to each of said support cords to said cord guides 

fitted to said upper box. 
A variable horizontal blind as claimed in claim 
3, wherein one ends of said lifting cords are fixed to said 

upper box on or in the vicinity of the upper end side of the 
front vertical portion and the rear vertical portion of a 

support cord located on one side in the lateral direction among 
said support cords; cord guides on which said lifting cord is 

hooked are disposed on each of said support cords in the 
vicinity of the front edge portion and the rear edge portion of 

a specified one of said slats which is determined arbitrarily, 
and on said upper box in the vicinity of the upper end side of 

the front vertical portion and the rear vertical direction of 
a support cord located on the other side in the lateral 

direction; and said lifting cord is hooked on from said cord 
guide located on each of said support cords to said cord guide 

located on said upper box. 
A variable horizontal blind as claimed in claim 
1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein said lifting cord passes through-holes 

 
for insertion of vertically moving cord, which are defined in 

said slats located above where said lifting cord is fixed.
