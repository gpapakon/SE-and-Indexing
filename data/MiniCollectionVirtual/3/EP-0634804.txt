<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
nickel positive electrode for an alkaline storage battery, 
and also to a sealed type nickel-hydrogen storage battery 
using the nickel positive electrode. Recent trend for high value-added and down-sized 
portable apparatus has significantly enhanced the 
requirement for high energy density secondary cells. 
Development of new secondary cells having a high energy 
density is also highly required as a battery of electric 
vehicles. Alkaline storage batteries recently developed 
to meet these demands include a high-capacity nickel-cadmium 
storage battery with a conventional sintered 
nickel positive electrode, and a high energy-density 
nickel-cadmium storage battery with a foamed nickel 
positive electrode having a capacity 30 to 60 % higher 
than that of the conventional electrode. Another example 
is a nickel-hydrogen storage battery using a hydrogen 
storage alloy as a negative electrode, which has a higher  
 
capacity than the nickel-cadmium storage batteries. In such high-capacity alkaline storage 
batteries, nickel hydroxide powder is closely packed into 
a sintered nickel porous substrate, a three-dimensional 
foamed nickel porous substrate having the high porosity of 
not less than 90% or a nickel fiber porous substrate in 
order to improve the energy density of the positive 
electrode. The closely packed nickel hydroxide has 
improved the energy density to 450 to 500 mAh/cm³ for the 
recent sintered nickel positive electrodes and to 550 to 
650 mAh/cm³ for the foamed nickel positive electrodes, 
compared to the energy density of 400 to 450 mAh/cm³ for 
the conventional sintered nickel positive electrodes. In such positive electrodes prepared by closely 
packing nickel hydroxide powder in a sintered nickel 
porous substrate, a foamed nickel porous substrate or a 
nickel fiber porous substrate, the packing density is 
increased by application of pressure. Application of the 
pressure, however, causes expansion of electrode plates 
and compresses separators each placed between a positive 
electrode and a negative electrode in the course of 
repetitive charging and discharging. The compression of 
the separators presses out an electrolyte solution 
included in the separators which makes a significant 
contribution to charge and discharge characteristics, thus 
deteriorating the discharge characteristics. A battery is  
 
sometimes discharged to approximately 0V by an accidental 
continuous power-on of a portable apparatus. Repeated 
charging and
