<ABSTRACT>
A pulsating combustor (10) having flat side walls (16, 18) and flat end walls (20) defining the combustion chamber (12), along with devices for introducing a fuel mix (32) into the combustion chamber and for initiating pulsating combustion (33), is improved by the provision of an insert at the four corner regions, such that smoothly rounded surfaces (34) are presented to the combustion chamber (12). In a variant, a pulsating combustor defines a combustion chamber and an exhaust portion, the latter incorporating a plurality of internal, parallel, spaced-apart hollow baffles (152) which define, between themselves and parallel outside walls of the exhaust portion, a plurality of exhaust passageways (154).

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN PULSE BLADE SYSTEMFOR PULSATING COMBUSTORSThis invention relates generally to pulsating combustors, and provides several refinements and improvements in such systems. Prior ArtThe closest prior art known to me is represented by my own prior U.S. patent 4,846, 149, issued on January 9, 1990, and the corresponding Canadian patent 1,280,065, issued February 12, 1991.These patents disclose a pulsating combustor in the form of a blade having a combustion chamber defined between two parallel walls, side walls and an end wall, and an exhaust portion again defined by two parallel walls. The parallel walls in the exhaust portion, however, are closer together than in the combustion chamber, and the unit incorporates two oblique intermediate walls forming a transitional area between the wider combustion chamber and the narrower exhaust portion.A major use for the blade pulsating combustor disclosed in the said U.S. patent 4,846,149 is that of heating various fluids, particularly water. By setting up a pulsating combustion in the combustion chamber, the shock wave activity in the unit diminishes or eliminates the typical "boundary layer" of gases immediately adjacent the inside wall surfaces, thus greatly improving the conduction of heat outwardly through the walls of the blade pulsating combustor. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTIONThe present specification sets forth a number of improvements on the basic blade configuration. More particularly, this invention provides a pulsating combustor comprising: two parallel and substantially flat side wall panels separated to define opposed longer sides of an elongate combustion chamber having an exhaust end and an entry end, two substantially flat end wall panels spanning between the respective corresponding ends of the side wall panels and defining opposed shorter sides of 

said elongate combustion chamber, said chamber being substantially rectangular when seen in a transverse section taken perpendicular to all said panels, bottom wall means at said entry end of the combustion chamber, exhaust means communicating with said exhaust end for ducting the products of combustion away from the combustion chamber, first means for introducing a fuel mixture into the combustion chamber, and second means for initiating pulsating combustion in the combustion chamber, characterized in that: insert means are provided for occupying the four corner regions adjacent the end wall panels, and for presenting smoothly rounded surfaces partially delimiting the combustion

THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION IN WHICH AN EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OR PRIVILEGE IS CLAIMED ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:
1. A pulsating combustor comprising: two parallel and substantially flat side wall panels (28, 30) separated to define opposed longer sides of an elongate combustion chamber (12) having an exhaust end and an entry end, two substantially flat end wall panels (20) spanning between the respective corresponding ends of the side wall panels (28, 30) and defining opposed shorter sides of said elongate combustion chamber (12), said chamber being substantially rectangular when seen in a transverse section taken perpendicular to all said panels, bottom wall means (33a) at said entry end of the combustion chamber (12), exhaust means (14) communicating with said exhaust end for ducting the products of combustion away from the combustion chamber (12), first means (32) for introducing a fuel mixture into the combustion chamber (12), and second means (33) for initiating pulsating combustion in the combustion chamber (12), characterized in that: insert means (34) are provided for occupying the four corner regions adjacent the end wall panels (20), and for presenting smoothly rounded surfaces partially delimiting the combustion chamber (12), thereby to counteract any tendency for the fuel mixture to become trapped in squared-off corners.
2. The invention claimed in claim 1, in which the insert means (34) is shaped to provide cylindrically rounded end portions for the combustion chamber (12).
3. The invention claimed in claim 1, in which said exhaust means (14) includes two substantially flat exhaust side panels (16, 18) spaced apart by a smaller distance than said side wall panels (28, 30) defining the combustion chamber, and 


two exhaust end panels (20) spanning between respective corresponding ends of the exhaust side panels (16, 18), further characterized in that: there is provided a liquid-heating conduit means (59) in heat-conductive contact with one of the exhaust side panels (16, 18) and the corresponding side wall panel (28, 30), the liquid heating conduit means having a boustrophedonic configuration (60) adjacent said one of the exhaust side panels (16, 18) and being divided into a plurality of one-pass pipes (66) adjacent said corresponding side wall panel (28, 30), the one-pass pipes being connected in parallel between a header (68) and a downstream collecting manifold (70).
4. A pulsating combustor comprising: two substantially cylindrical and substantially concentric side wall panels (130, 134, 136) defining between them a substantially cylindical combustion chamber (132, 132a) having an exhaust end (137) and an entry end (139), exhaust means (134, 136) communicating with said exhaust end (137) for ducting the products of combustion away from the combustion chamber (132, 132a), first means (72) for introducing a fuel mixture into the combustion chamber (132, 132a), and second means (33) for initiating pulsating combustion in the combustion chamber (132, 132a), characterized in that: said first means includes the provision of: a) a diffuser baffle (76) substantially coinciding with said entry end (139) and lying perpendicular to the axis of the cylidrical combustion chamber (132, 132a), and b) a plurality of substantially cylindrical intake tubes (72) perpendicular to said diffuser baffle (76) and each having a downstream end adjacent the diffuser baffle (76) and an upstream end remote from the diffuser baffle (76), the upstream end having a bell-like configuration (74), the downstream ends of the intake tubes (72) being spaced away from said diffuser baffle (76).

8. The pulsating combustor claimed in claim 4, in which the exhaust means includes inner and outer coaxial, cylindrical exhaust walls (134, 136) defining between them an annular exhaust passageway, the pulsating combustor further including a cylindrical water jacket surrounding at least the downstream portion of the outer cylindrical exhaust wall in heat-conductive contact therewith, and a perforated, cylindrical exhaust decoupler unit disposed at right-angles to the axis of the exhaust walls and projecting therethrough along a diameter thereof.
9. A pulsating combustor comprising: two parallel and substantially flat side wall panels (140, 140a) separated to define opposed longer sides of an elongate combustion chamber (142) having an exhaust end and an entry end, end wall means spanning corresponding ends of the side wall panels (140, 140a) and defining opposed shorter sides of the combustion chamber (142), bottom wall means (148, 148a) at an entry end of the combustion chamber (142), an exhaust portion (144) communicating with said combustion chamber (142) for ducting the products of combustion away from the combustion chamber (142),
