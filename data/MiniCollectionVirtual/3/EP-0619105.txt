<ABSTRACT>
A "patient-friendly" surgical wound dressing (10) 
comprises an absorbent layer (11) having an area commensurate 

with the extent of the wound (12) to be dressed, an occlusive 
layer (13) overlying and extending beyond the edges (14) of 

the absorbent layer, a suction tube (15) between the absorbent 
layer (11) and the occlusive layer (13) and open to the 

absorbent layer (through holes 16), self-adhesive at least 
along marginal portions (17) of the side of the occlusive 

layer facing the absorbent layer, and at least one free end 
(18) of the suction tube (15) projecting out from the 

occlusive layer for ready connection to suction apparatus

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical wound dressings. Absorbent dressings, occlusive dressings and suction 
drainage are well known in the treatment of surgical wounds. Absorbentdressings. These absorb and retain blood 
and serum from the vicinity of the wound. These dressings are 
made of a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics (such as 
cotton, and polyesters) and are applied to wounds to collect 
blood and exudate coming out of the wound. They are usually 
changed and discarded in the interests of the comfort and 
hygiene of the patient. Absorbent dressings are sterile or 
surgically clean and facilitate the healing of the wound by 
preventing contamination or the introduction of pathogenic 
bacteria from without. Absorbent dressings suffer from the disadvantages of 
sometimes becoming heavily impregnated with blood and serum. 
This may lead to maceration of the skin surrounding the wound 
with delay in wound healing. The blood or wound exudate may 
leak through the dressing and soil the clothes and bedclothes 
of the patient. Drying of the blood and exudate in a fabric 
dressing may create a hard composite with the fabric of the 
dressing which then becomes uncomfortable for the patient. In 
cases where circumferential bandages have been used on the 
limbs, the stiff or hardened dressing can create a danger to 
the venous circulation of the limb with complications such as 
swelling, venous occlusion, venous thrombosis and circulatory 
occlusion of the limb. When wet or heavily impregnated with wound exudate,  
 
fabric dressings may allow the growth of pathological 
organisms within the dressing. This constitutes a danger of 
wound infection. Occlusivedressings. These are made of membranes 
which occlude the passage of blood and fluids. They can 
protect the clothes and bedclothes from wound leakage and 
conversely, they serve to protect the wound from possible 
contamination during bathing. Occlusive dressings can also be 
used in cases, such as burns or trauma, involving massive skin 
loss, to prevent excessive drying of the wound with 
subsequent dehydration of the patient. Occlusive dressings 
are usually adhesive and there are several types at present on 
the market, such as OPSITE sold by Smith and Nephew Ltd., and 
TAGADERM sold by 3Ms Medical. When used by themselves early in the management of 
surgical wounds, occlusive dressings suffer from the 
disadvantage of accumulation of excessive fluid beneath the 
dressing which may leak out of the edges. They are therefore 
often used in

<CLAIMS>
A surgical wound dressing (10) characterised by 
an absorbent layer (11) having an area commensurate with the 

extent of the wound (12) to be dressed, an occlusive layer 
(13) overlying and extending beyond the edges (14) of the 

absorbent layer, a suction tube (15) between the absorbent 
layer and the occlusive layer and open to the absorbent layer, 

self-adhesive at least along marginal portions (17) of the 
sides of the occlusive layer facing the aborbent layer, and at 

least one free end (18) of the suction tube (15) projecting 
out from the occlusive layer (13) for ready connection to 

suction apparatus. 
A dressing as in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the self-adhesive covers the whole of the occlusive layer (13) 

so that it serves to hold the suction tube (15) and the 
absorbent layer (11) thereto during manufacture, storage and 

transport, and application of the dressing. 
A dressing as in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that a releasable backing (24) of at least 

equal extent to the occlusive layer (13) is applied during 
manufacture to protect the adhesive and the absorbent layer 

(11). 
A dressing as in Claim 3, characterised in that 
after manufacture it is sealed in a sterile package (26). 
A dressing as in any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the suction tube (15) is a looped tube 

with holes (16) in the wall thereof spaced along the loop and 
facing the absorbent layer (11). 
A dressing as in Claim 5, characterised in that a 
plastics collar or connector (21) is moulded on to the suction 

tube (15). 
A dressing as in Claim 6, characterised in that 
the plastics collar or connector (21) is sealed to the 

occlusive dressing (13) at the time of manufacture.
