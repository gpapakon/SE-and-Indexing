<ABSTRACT>
An optical read apparatus is adapted to read record carriers of a first type 
and record carriers of a second type. The record carrier of the first type comprises an 

information structure (Figure 2a) arranged in tracks and adapted to be scanned with 
radiation of a first wavelength. The record carrier of the second type comprises an 

information structure in the form of a phase structure (Figure 3a) arranged in tracks and 
comprising effects (16) which alternate with intermediate areas. The information 

structure (Fig. 3a) of the record carrier of the second type is adapted to be scanned with 
radiation of a second wavelength longer than the first wavelength. The device comprises 

scanning means (4, 6, 10) for scanning the information structure in the track of a record 
carrier of the first or the second type present in the device by means of a focused beam 

(9) of radiation of the first wavelength. A detection system (11) converts radiation from 
the scanned portion of the track into an analog read signal (12). A signal converter (40) 

converts the read signal (12) into a corresponding binary information signal (49). The 
signal converter (40) comprises a first comparator (55) for supplying a first detection 

signal (47) if the difference (A-B) between two signal values (A; B) of the read signal 
(12) which are situated at a given time interval (T) from one another exceeds a given 

positive threshold value (44). A second comparator (56) supplies a second detection 
signal (48) in the case that the difference (A-B) between two signal values (A; B) of the 

read signal (12) which are situated at the given time interval (T) from one another is 
below a given negative threshold value (45). A signal recovery circuit (46) derives the 

binary information signal (50) from the first (47) and the second detection signal (48).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for optically reading record carriers of a
first type and record carriers of a second type, each type of information carrier having
an information structure, the information structure of the record carrier of the first type
being designed to be read with radiation of a first wavelength and the information
structure of the record carrier of the second type being a phase structure arranged in
tracks and designed to be read with radiation of a second wavelength longer than the
first wavelength, which device comprises scanning means for scanning the information
structure in a track of a record carrier of the first or the second type present in the
device by means of a focused beam of radiation of the first wavelength, a detection
system for converting radiation received from a scanned portion of the track into an
analog read signal, and a signal converter for converting the read signal into a
corresponding binary information signal.Such a device is known from EP-A-0,525,896. By means of the known
device it is possible to read high-density record carriers comprising an information
structure which is arranged in the form of tracks and whose dimensions are adapted to
be read by means of a beam of radiation having a short wavelength (of the order of
magnitude of 400 to 600 nm). In the known device the same radiation beam can be used
for reading record carriers with a lower information density, such as for example
Compact Discs, on which the recorded information is represented by a phase structure
arranged in tracks in the form of a pattern of pits whose geometry is adapted to be read
with a beam of radiation of a wavelength larger than that of the radiation beam used in
the device, for example of the order of magnitude of 800 nm. In order to ensure a
reliable read-out when the record carrier with the lower information density is read the
radiation beam is not aimed at the centre of the track, as is customary, but at the edge
of the track. To read the high-density record carrier the radiation beam is aimed, as is
customary, at the centre of the track. This means that depending on the type of record
carrier the tracking system is set to a first mode, in which the centre of a track is
followed, or to a second mode, in which the edge of a track is followed. Operating in 
two different tracking modes is undesirable. This is particularly so in the case that a so-called
three-spot tracking system (having one main spot and two satellite spots) is used.
This is because for a given
