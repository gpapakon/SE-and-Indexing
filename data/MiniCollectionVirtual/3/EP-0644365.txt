<ABSTRACT>
This seal is designed to be interposed between the collar of a manhole and a vertical tube for access to an external pipeline, the inside diameter of which may have two magnitudes. According to the invention, it includes a cylindrical skirt (9) with an outer collar (11) mounted over the top of it, this outer collar being designed to bear against the upper end of the joining tube, this cylindrical skirt (9) itself being composed of three parts, an upper part (9a) whose thickness, in the compressed state, corresponds substantially to the difference in radii of the collar and of the bore of a vertical connection tube of small diameter, a lower part (9b) whose thickness, added to that of the upper part (9a) and in the compressed state, corresponds substantially to the difference in radii of the collar and of the bore of a connecting tube of large diameter and, between these two parts (9a, 9b), an intermediate part (9c) of very small thickness, to allow the lower part (9b) to be turned up over the upper part.

A multi-purpose seal for an access manhole to an underground 
passage through a vertical connection tube (6, 7), the manhole (2) 

comprising a tubular body, generally of cast iron, of which the upper end 
constitutes an annular frame (3) forming the seat (3a) for a removable 

closure cover or plug (4) and of which the lower end is constituted by a 
barrel (5) intended to be engaged in the upper end of a vertical 

connecting tube (6, 7) of small or large diameter, with the interposition 
of a sealing joint, this joint (8), being annular and of elastomeric 

material, including a cylindrical skirt (9) surmounted by an external collar 
(11), this cylindrical skirt (9) being itself composed of three parts, an 

upper part (9a) carrying the collar, a lower part (9b) and, between these 
two parts (9a, 9b) an intermediate part (9c) of very small thickness to 

permit the lower part (9b) to be turned up on the upper part, 
characterised in that the lower part (9b) of the joint turns up on the 

exterior of the upper part (9a) of which the collar (11) provides an 
annular groove (11a) having a width at least equal to the thickness of the 

lower end (9'b) of the lower part (9b) of the cylindrical skirt (9), to effect 
the retention of this lower part in the turned up state. 
A sealing joint according to Claim 1, characterised in that at 
least the upper part (9a) of its cylindrical skirt (9) provides a flexible 

internal lip (9'a). 
A sealing joint according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the upper end of the bore of the lower part (9b) of its skirt (9) is flared to 

form a conical bearing surface (9"b) for introduction into the connecting  
 

tube when this connecting tube (7) is of large diameter and when this 
lower part (9b) is turned up on the upper part (9a) of this skirt (9).
