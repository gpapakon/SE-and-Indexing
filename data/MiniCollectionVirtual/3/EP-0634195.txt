<ABSTRACT>
A golf club head includes a plurality of elongated 
strips of insert material in the face of the club head. The 

face is provided with a plurality of recesses, and the insert 
material fills the recesses. The face may also be provided with 

an elongated groove between each pair of adjacent recesses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to golf clubs, and, more 
particularly, to a golf club head which is provided with a 
plurality of elongated, spaced-apart inserts. The rules of golf have recently been modified to permit 
a golf club head, in particular an iron-type club head, to 
include an insert in the face of the club. The material of the 
insert may be different than the material of the club face. As 
a result, many club heads have been designed which include an 
insert in the face. The inserts which have heretofore been designed 
conventionally are monolithic pieces which provide a continuous 
hitting surface on the face of the club head. The insert may 
extend over substantially the entire portion of the face which 
normally contacts the golf ball, or it may occupy a smaller 
portion of the face in the sweet spot of the club head. A club head formed in accordance with the invention 
includes a plurality of elongated, spaced-apart inserts in the 
face of the club head. The material of face is exposed in the 
areas between the inserts, and the hitting surface which 
contacts the golf ball at impact comprises alternating areas of 
insert material and face material. It is believed that such a 
face construction provides improved feel at the time of ball 
impact compared with a face on which only a single material 
contacts the ball.  The invention will be explained in conjunction with 
illustrative embodiments shown in the accompanying drawing, in 
which -- 
Figure 1 is a front elevational view of an iron-type 
club head formed in accordance with the invention; Figure 2 is a sectional view taken along the line 2-2 
of Figure 1; Figure 2A is an enlarged view of a portion of Figure 2; Figures 3 through 6 are elevational views of modified 
embodiments of an iron club head; Figure 7 is an elevational view of a wood-type club 
head; Figures 8 through 10 are elevational views of modified 
embodiments of wood-type club heads; Figure 11 is a sectional veiw taken along the line 
11-11 of Figure 7; and Figures 12 through 15 are fragmentary sectional views 
of modified wood-type club heads. Referring first to Figures 1, 2, and 2A, the numeral 20 
designates generally an iron-type of club head which includes a 
body or blade 21 and a hosel 22. The hosel is provided with a 
bore 23 for attaching the club head to a conventional shaft. The blade includes a heel 24 which joins with the 
hosel, a toe 25, a sole 26, a top edge or surface 27, a back 
surface 28, and a ball-striking face 29. The angle of the plane  
 
of the face

<CLAIMS>
A golf club head comprising a body having a sole, a 
toe portion, a heel portion, a top surface, a back 

surface, and ball-striking face, the face being formed 
of a first material and having a plurality of 

elongated spaced-apart recesses therein, the recesses 
being filled with an insert material which is 

different than the first material. 
The club head of claim 1 in which the insert material 
is substantially flush with the ball-striking face. 
A golf club head of claim 1, a face being formed of 
metal and having at least three elongated, parallel, 

spaced-apart recesses therein which are filled with 
insert material which is softer than the metal of the 

face, the face having preferably an elongated groove 
between each pair of adjacent recesses which extends 

parallel to the recesses. 
The club head of claim 1 or 3 in which the insert 
material is urethane. 
The club head of claim 1 or 3 in which the insert 
material is epoxy. 
The club head of claim 1 or 2 in which the insert 
material is graphite fibers and resin. 
The club head of claim 1 in which the recesses are 
parallel and extend between the toe portion and the 

heel portion. 
The club head of claim 3 in which the recesses and the 
grooves extend between the toe portion and the heel 

portion. 
The club head of one of the claims 1 to 8 in which the 
face is provided with an elongated groove between each 

pair of adjacent recesses. 
The club head of claim 9 in which the grooves extend 
parallel to the recesses. 
The club head of one of the claims 1 to 10 in which 
the grooves and the recesses are substantially the 

same length. 
The club head of at least one of the claims 1 to 11 in 
which the club head is an iron-type of club head. 
The club head of at least one of the claims 1 to 11 in 
which the club head is a wood-type of club head. 
The club head of one of the claims 1 to 13 in which 
the width of the recesses is within the range of about 

0.062 to about 0.312 inch. 
The club head of claim 1 in which the face has at 
least three of said recesses.
