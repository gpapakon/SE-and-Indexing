<ABSTRACT>
An inspection machine for inspecting the 
circumference of a vertically standing container 

comprising means for conveying a vertically standing 
container through an inspection location including 

means (18, 20) for directing a beam (16) of 
collimated light vertically downwardly towards the 

container, the beam having a configuration selected 
so that when the container is located at the 

inspection location the periphery of the beam will be 
spaced from the circumference of the container, two 

dimensional camera means (30) for axially viewing the 
profile of the vertical projection of a container at 

the inspection location, and image processing means 
(32) for evaluating the circumference of the profile 

viewed by the two dimensional camera and accepting or 
rejecting the container including means for defining 

the center of the acquired image, and means for 
remapping the perimeter of the acquired image into at 

least one two-dimensional rectangular area bisected 
by an imaginary line representing the perimeter of an 

ideal container in vertical projection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the inspection
of cylindrical glass ware for malformations,
dimensional variations and defects.Glass containers are conventionally produced in
an I.S. (individual section) machine from discrete
gobs of molten glass. Each gob is first operated on
in a blank mold, which has opposed side portions to
form a parison and then the parison is blown into the
finished container in a blow mold which also has
opposed side portions. The container should have the
desired shape (cross section). Where the overall
variation from this shape is excessive, the container
should be rejected. Where these opposed side
portions of the blow mold come together a bottle seam
will be formed and can usually be observed in the
formed container. This seam (a local variation) can
be unacceptably noticeable or a thin "fin" of glass
can be formed at the seam and extend partially or
completely along the seam. In either case, the
container should be rejected upon inspection.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an improved algorithm for inspecting the
exterior dimensions of glass bottles.The invention generally comprises an inspection
machine for inspecting the circumference of a
vertically standing container comprising
means for conveying a vertically standing
container through an inspection location includingmeans for directing a beam of collimated
light vertically downwardly towards the container,
said beam having a configuration selected so that
when the container is located at the inspection
location the periphery of said beam will be spaced
from the circumference of the container, two dimensional camera means for axially
viewing the profile of the vertical projection of a 
container at the inspection location, andimage processing means for evaluating the
circumference of the profile viewed by said two
dimensional camera includingmeans for defining the center of the
acquired image, andmeans for remapping the perimeter of
the acquired image into at least one two-dimensional
rectangular area bisected by an imaginary line
representing the perimeter of an ideal container in
vertical projection. Other objects and advantages of the present
invention will become apparent from the following
portion of this specification and from the
accompanying drawings which illustrate in accordance
with the mandate of the patent statutes a presently
preferred embodiment incorporating the principles of
the invention.Referring to the drawings:
