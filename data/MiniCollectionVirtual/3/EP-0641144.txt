<ABSTRACT>
A metal oxide film resistor having a resistance 
value in a wide range from 100Ω to 10 MΩ, a small 

variance in its resistance, and a positive and small 
temperature coefficient of resistance is made by 

comprising mainly indium oxide and auxiliarily an oxide of 
at least one metal added as an activator for covering the 

wide range of resistance. A method of producing the metal 
oxide film resistor comprises the steps of: preparing a 

solution composed of at least an inorganic indium salt, an 
organic compound capable of coordinating to indium, and an 

organic solvent capable of dissolving said components; 
applying said solution to an insulating substrate to form 

a coated film; firing the coated film to form an indium 
oxide film; and optionally subjecting said indium oxide 

film to a heat treatment under an inert gas atmosphere or 
a reducing gas atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal oxide 
film resistor which has wide applications for configuring 
circuits in various electric appliances, and a method for 
producing such metal oxide film resistors. Conventional metal oxide film resistors are 
generally configured with insulating substrates of rod-type 
made of mullite or alumina, metal oxide films 
comprising tin oxide or antimony tin oxide (ATO) formed on 
the surfaces of the substrates, pairs of metal cap 
terminals press-fitted on both ends of the substrates, 
lead wires welded to the terminals, and electrically 
insulating protective films formed on the surfaces of the 
resistors. Of these metal oxide film resistors, those 
comprising a single phase of tin oxide have a very large 
temperature coefficient of resistance and their conditions 
for application are greatly limited, and are therefore not 
practical. For this reason, the ATO has now been put into  
 
practical use as the material for the metal oxide film in 
general. The method for producing the metal oxide film is 
generally performed in a chemical film forming process 
such as spraying or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In 
these processes, a film of ATO is formed on the surface of 
the substrate by spraying vapor of an aqueous solution or 
an organic solvent solution containing stannic chloride 
and antimony trichloride to the substrate of rod-type 
placed in a furnace elevated to 600 - 800°C. Thereafter, 
a pair of metal cap terminals are press-fitted on both 
ends of the substrate, and a part of the film is cut or 
grooved in order to adjust the resistance of the film to 
have a desired value. The metal oxide film resistor is 
completed by welding a pair of lead wires to the metal cap 
terminals, and forming a resin protective coating film on 
these components. However, the metal oxide film resistor using the 
ATO film has a disadvantage that it has a large variance 
or dispersion or scatter in its resistance value, 
presumably because the ATO film is formed by an unstable 
film forming process such as spraying process and the 
antimony therein is thermally unstable. In addition, 
since specific resistance of the ATO film is relatively 
low, e.g., about from 1 × 10⁻³ to 1 × 10⁻² Ω · cm, the 
film thickness must be made considerably thin in a case  
 
wherein the final resistance value is 100 kΩ or above. 
When this inconvenience is put together with the above-mentioned 
disadvantage in the manufacturing process which 
represents the large variance in its resistance value,
