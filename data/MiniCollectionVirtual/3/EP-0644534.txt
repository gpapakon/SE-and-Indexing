<ABSTRACT>
An air bearing slider (10) for a magnetic head assembly is 
configured with taper flat outer rails (18, 20) and a 

recessed region between the rails (18, 20) in one embodiment 
of the invention, a hard wear-resistant layer is deposited 

over part of the rail area (18, 20) with a thin residual 
layer over the remainder of the slider area, yielding a step 

in thickness near the load point. In another embodiment, the 
wear-resistant layer (23, 24) appears only on the side rails 

(18, 20). In an alternative embodiment using a tripad 
configuration of the air bearing surface, the hard wear-resistant 

layer is disposed on portions of all 3 pads. The 
invention allows control and minimization of the stiction 

forces between an air bearing slider (10) and a magnetic 
disk, particularly during liftoff at the start of disk drive 

operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to air bearing sliders used with magnetic 
head assemblies in disk drives. Although the following description is directed to an air bearing 
slider, it should be understood that the invention is also 
applicable to contact or pseudo-contact type sliders. Magnetic head assemblies that fly relative to rotating magnetic 
disks are used extensively in disk drives for recording or 
reading data. An objective for optimizing the noncontact 
transducing relationship between the flying head and the magnetic 
recording disk is to maintain a very close, constant, and stable 
spacing between the head slider and the disk surface. A close 
spacing, coupled with very narrow transducing gaps and very thin 
magnetic record films, allows recording of very short wavelength, 
high frequency signals, thereby maximizing the density and 
storage capacity of data recording. Constant spacing between the 
flying head slider and the disk surface minimizes the 
fluctuations in the signal amplitude, therefore optimizing signal 
resolution. This constant spacing must be maintained as the head 
slider moves between the inner and outer regions of the disk 
surface, therefore the effects of the change in skew on the 
flying height must be held to a minimum. Air bearing sliders used in disk drives typically have a leading 
edge, and a trailing edge at which thin film transducers are 
deposited. Generally, the sliders have tapered portions at the 
leading edge and longitudinal rails that extend from the tapers 
all or part way to the trailing edge. The tapers may be shaped 
and of such length as to provide fast takeoff of the slider from 
a rest position, where it is seated in contact with the disk  
 
surface, to a flying altitude relative to the disk. When the disk drive goes into operation and the aerodynamics of 
the air bearing slider cause it to lift off from the surface of 
an associated magnetic disk, stiction may occur and cause severe 
problems. For example, wear can result on the overcoat of the 
magnetic media or the underlying layer. Also adhesive failure 
mechanisms can be induced, resulting in particulate generation 
which can produce fretting wear and catastrophic failure of the 
head-to-disk interface. In addition, any change in the properties 
of the transducer tips can cause changes in flying height with 
resultant degradation of signal amplitude. An object of this invention is to provide a magnetic head air 
bearing slider wherein the stiction force at the initially 
contacting head
