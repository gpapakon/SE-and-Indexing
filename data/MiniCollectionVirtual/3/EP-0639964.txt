<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article, such as a sanitary napkin, having longitudinal side margins with pleats or tucks is provided. The tucks cause the absorbent article to assume a curved, body-conforming shape, and provide the absorbent article with sides that stand up to serve as a barrier to soiling of the wearer's undergarments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as
sanitary napkins, panty liners, adult incontinence devices, and
the like. More particularly, the present invention concerns
absorbent articles having longitudinal side margins with pleats or
tucks. The tucks cause the absorbent articles to assume a curved,
body-conforming shape, and provide the absorbent article with
sides that stand up to serve as a barrier to soiling of the
wearer's undergarments.All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured for
the absorption of body fluids such as menses, urine, and feces
are, of course, well known.Generally, absorbent articles are configured so that they
have a longitudinal dimension and transverse dimension, the latter
being smaller to fit between the wearer's legs in the area of the
wearer's crotch. One persistent problem with absorbent articles
is that the forces applied by the wearer's legs during use tend to 
compress and distort the absorbent articles making them unable to
conform to the wearer's body. Another problem is the tendency for
leakage to occur along the longitudinal side edges of the
absorbent articles. The causes of such leakage can be attributed
to a number of factors. These include the fact that liquids
simply have a shorter distance to travel to reach the longitudinal
side edges. The compression and distortion of the sanitary napkin
also contribute to side leakage.While work has progressed in attempting to create absorbent
articles that conform to the wearer's body and to solve such
longitudinal side leakage in various different types of absorbent
articles, a good deal of the most recent work has been done with
sanitary napkins. Currently, the trend has been to provide
sanitary napkins with elasticized longitudinal side edges.Sanitary napkins provided with elastics of various types are
disclosed in European Patent Application Publication No. 0 091 412

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent article (20) such as a sanitary napkin, panty liner,
or adult incontinent article for wearing within the crotch

portion of a garment and fastening to said garment, said
absorbent article having two longitudinal side margins (40), said

absorbent article comprising a liquid pervious topsheet (34), a
liquid impervious backsheet (36) joined to said topsheet (34), an

absorbent core (38) positioned between said topsheet (34) and said
backsheet (36), and a fastener (50) on said backsheet (36) for fastening

said absorbent article (20) to said garment, said absorbent
article (20) characterized in that at least one of the

longitudinal side margins (40) of the absorbent article (20) has at
least one tuck (42) formed therein wherein a first portion (44) of said

longitudinal side margin (40) is folded adjacent to a second
portion (46) of said longitudinal side margin (40) and secured thereto

in a side-by-side relationship thereby imparting a curved
shape to said absorbent article (20).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 wherein said topsheet (34),
backsheet (36), and absorbent core (38) each have two longitudinal

edges (28) and two transverse edges (30), and the longitudinal edges (28) of
said topsheet (34) and backsheet (36) extend outward beyond the

longitudinal edges (28) of said absorbent core (38) to form said
longitudinal side margins (40).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 2 wherein only one of said
topsheet (34) and said backsheet (36) have a tuck (42) formed therein to

form a foreshortened topsheet (34) or backsheet (36), and the other of
said topsheet (34) and said backsheet (36) is attached to said

foreshortened topsheet (34) or backsheet (36).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 2 wherein said tuck (42) is formed
in both of said topsheet (34) and said backsheet (36). 
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 wherein at least one of the
longitudinal edges (28) of said topsheet (34) has a notch formed

therein wherein the portions of said topsheet (34) surrounding
said notch comprise surrounding portions, and said notch has

two sides defined by the surrounding portions of said
topsheet (34), and said sides are secured together, wherein the

longitudinal side edges (28) of the backsheet (36) underlying said
notch has at least one tuck (42) formed therein, and said

longitudinal edges (28) of said topsheet (34) and backsheet (36) are secured
together.
A longitudinally extensible absorbent article (20) according to
Claim 1 wherein said topsheet (34), backsheet (36), and absorbent core (38)

are extensible.
A method of making an absorbent article (20) for wearing within
the crotch portion of a garment, said absorbent article (20)

having a tuck (42) formed in at least one of its longitudinal side
margins (40), thereby imparting a curved shape to said absorbent

article (20), said method characterized in that it comprises the
steps of:


(a) providing an absorbent article (20) having two longitudinal
side margins (40), said absorbent article (20) comprising a liquid

pervious topsheet (34), a liquid impervious backsheet (36) joined
to said topsheet (34), and an absorbent core (38) positioned

between said topsheet (34) and said backsheet (36);
(b) folding said absorbent article (20) along at least one
transverse axis so that portions of said longitudinal

side margins (40) are gathered in; and
(c) securing at least some of said gathered longitudinal
side margins (40) to each other to form tucks (42).
