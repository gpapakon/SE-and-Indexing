<ABSTRACT>
Dental cast materials are usually formed from gold alloys and/or titanium alloys. It is important in this case that the proportion of the individual alloy components corresponds to the requirements because the alloy components have a significant influence on the properties of the respective dental cast material. In order to check the dental cast materials for the correct alloy, it is usual to determine the time-related temperature gradient during melting or time-related temperature-proportional values. However, these alone still do not allow simple or meaningful testing. According to the invention, the time/temperature values determined are standardised to a given desired value and the standardised time/temperature values are compared with the desired time/temperature values. In this manner, simple and accurate testing is possible. This testing can most simply be carried out visually.
