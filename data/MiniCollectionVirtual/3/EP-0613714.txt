<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
process for purifying exhaust gases. More
particularly, it relates to a process which
can efficiently purify nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the exhaust
gases which contain oxygen in excessive amounts required for
oxidizing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) therein.As catalysts for purifying automotive exhaust gases, there
have been employed 3-way catalysts so far which oxidize CO and
HC and reduces NOx simultaneously to purify the exhaust gases.
For example, the 3-way catalysts have been known widely which
comprise a heat resistant support formed of cordierite, a
catalyst carrier layer formed of gamma-alumina and disposed on
the support, and a noble metal selected from the group
consisting of Pt, Pd and Rh and loaded on the catalyst carrier
layer. The purifying performance of the 3-way catalysts for
purifying exhaust gases depends on the air-fuel ratio (A/F) of
automotive engine. For instance, when the air-fuel ratio is
large, i.e., when the fuel concentration is small (or on the
fuel-lean side), the oxygen concentration is large.
Accordingly, the oxidation reactions purifying CO and HC are
active, but the reduction reactions purifying NOx are inactive.
On the other hand, when the air-fuel ratio is small, i.e., when
the fuel concentration is more (or on the fuel-rich side), the
oxygen concentration is small. Accordingly, the oxidation
reactions are inactive, but the reduction reactions are active.Moreover, when driving automobiles, especially when
driving automobiles in urban areas, the automobiles are
accelerated and decelerated frequently. Consequently, the air-fuel
ratio varies frequently in the range of from the values
adjacent to the stoichiometric point (or the ideal air-fuel
ratio) to the fuel-rich side. In order to satisfy the low fuel
consumption requirement during the driving in urban areas, it
is necessary to operate the automobiles on the fuel-lean side
where the air-fuel mixture containing oxygen as excessive as
possible is supplied to the engines. Hence, it has been
desired to develop a catalyst which is capable of adequately
purifying NOx on the fuel-lean side (i.e., in the oxygen-rich
atmospheres). Under the circumstances, as set forth in
JP-A-5-168860, the
applicants of the present invention disclosed a catalyst with
rare-earth elements including La, and Pt loaded. With the
catalyst, NOx is absorbed on the rare-earth elements during the
the fuel-lean side (i.e., in the oxygen-rich atmospheres)
driving, and it is purified by reacting with the
