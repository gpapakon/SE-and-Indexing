<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna
used mainly in mobile telecommunication, particularly
to a compact antenna suited to be mounted on the shoulder
of a human body.In recent years, demands for mobile communications
using a radio unit such as a portable telephones
have been remarkably increasing. Such a radio
unit may comprise a compact and low profile type planar
antenna. As a compact antenna for a portable telephone,
the planar inverted F antenna has been used.
Constitution of such an antenna is described in "Performance
Analysis of a Built-in Planar Inverted F
Antenna for 800MHz Band Portable Radio Units", T. Taga
and K. Tsunekawa, IEEE Trans., vol. SAC-5, No. 5,
pp. 921-929 (1987) and in the Japanese Patent Application
No. 2-250655. The planar inverted F antenna is
compact in construction, and is capable of transmitting
and receiving both vertically and horizontally polarized
waves, and is therefore suitable for portable
telephones used in a multiple propagation environment.However, in the prior art described above,
since the planar inverted F antenna is installed on the
body case of the radio unit and the antenna is located
close to the human body during the operation of the
potable telephone, the gain of the antenna decreases
significantly. Also since the planar inverted F antenna
functions as an antenna when it is connected to the 
body case of a radio unit having a ground plane sufficiently
large relative to the antenna, it has been
impossible to install the antenna separately from the
radio unit. As a result, there has been a limit to the
size reduction of the radio unit, and it has been
impossible to reduce the size of a radio unit to such
an extent that it causes no trouble to the user at all
to carry it. Thus the use of such a conventional radio
unit which is not compact enough has been inconvenient,
particularly for those engaged in jobs which require
them to always carry the radio units with them. US 4,701,763 discloses an antenna including a dielectric plate, upper and lower
conductive plates provided on upper and lower faces of the dielectric plate, respectively,
a plurality of conductive reactance posts for connecting, at first positions of
the dielectric plate, the upper and lower conductive plates to each other, and a feed
point provided at a second position of the dielectric plate such that first and second
plane-parallel plate transmission lines separated from each other by the reactance
posts are formed by the upper and lower conductive plates.US 2,996,713 discloses an
