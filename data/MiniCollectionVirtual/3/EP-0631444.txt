<ABSTRACT>
Effectively using the ability of prediction by means of low-definition local decoded signal for predictive coding, the coding 
efficiency of a time-varying image encoder is improved. In a time-varying image encoder in which high-definition picture signal 

is subjected to predictive coding and low-definition picture signal produced by the conversion of the high-definition picture signal 
is encoded; a low-definition picture is created by removing one field from one frame through a field skipping circuit (102) 

(thinning) and by subjecting the other field to down-sampling through a down-sampling circuit (29), low-definition prediction 
signal is produced by subjecting the low-definition picture to up-sampling through an up-sampling circuit (35), high-definition 

prediction signal corresponding to the removed field is produced from the high-definition picture, and prediction signal is produced 
by combining alternately the low- and high-definition prediction signals through predictor (104).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motion picture
coding apparatus, and, more particularly, to a
motion picture coding apparatus for use in a system,
which transmits motion pictures over a line,
such as a TV conference or a TV telephone, a
system for storing motion pictures on a storage
medium, such as an optical disk or a video tape,
and digital television broadcasting.Today, standardization for a scheme for transmitting
motion pictures, which has high quality
equal to or higher than the quality for the current
TV system, at a rate of about several Mbps to
several tens of Mbps has progressed in the communication
field for future establishment of the service
in a broad-band network (H. 26X). Likewise, in
the fields of the storage system and broadcasting
system, standardization for a coding system which
has about the same picture quality and bit rate as
H. 26X has progressed (MPEG2 for the storage
system and CMTT/2 for the broadcasting system).
Since it is considered advantageous for popularization
to establish systems as common as possible in
those standardizations, the standardizations have
progressed while mutually exchanging information.In the communication system and storage system,
there already are H. 261 and MPEG1, which
are standard systems for motion picture coding
whose targets are lower picture quality and lower
bit rate. Specifically, the supply of hardware for
those standardizations has started. Therefore, one
of issues is that a new standard system to achieve
higher picture quality should have mutual connectability
(compatibility) with those existing standard
systems. There are two types of compatibility: forward
compatibility which permits a decoder of the
new system to decode a bit stream prepared by an
encoder of an existing system and backward compatibility
which permits a decoder of the existing
system to decode a part of a bit stream prepared
by an encoder of the new system. In consideration
of the fact that the decoder of the existing system
has already been defined whereas the decoder of
the new system has been undefined, the backward
compatibility would be a severe requirement for the
coding system.There may be various systems for ensuring the
backward compatibility. As one of those methods
that can define the compatibility as an option, a
system has been proposed which has a local decoded
signal of an existing system included as a
candidate for a predictive signal using in the new
system and forms a bit stream in such a way that a
part of the bit stream by the new system becomes
a
