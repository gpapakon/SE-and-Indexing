10, characterized in that the rigid piece (52) has an 

inclined part (55) in which a channel (77) has been cut, 
and the diaphragm (53) ends in a bevel so as to form a 

lip (54) which interacts with the inclined part (55), the 
lip (54) covering the channel (77) as far as its outer 

end which it closes, the inner end of the channel (77) 
opening out into the second chamber (61). 
Dispensing unit according to one of Claims 5 to 
11, characterized in that a cover (45) is provided to 

close the base (7), the pump (39) having been removed 
from the base (7), the cover (45) being equipped with 

tongues (48) designed to interact with the periphery of 
the diaphragm (8) of a one-way valve (50) arranged in 

line with the holes (17) of the base (7) so as to apply 
the diaphragm (8) against its seat, so that the bag (2) 

and its base (7) equipped with the cover (45) form a 
storable product refill.
