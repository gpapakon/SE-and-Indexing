<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and furnace construction to 
be used in producing easily volatile metals from their 

sulfides. The furnace construction comprises two closely 
connected furnaces, a reduction furnace and a converter, which 

are operated at normal pressure, so that the material transfer 
therebetween is arranged to be carried out continuously at 

normal pressure through at least one channel provided in 
between the furnaces. As a result of chemical reactions taking 

place in the furnaces, the hydrostatic pressure in the 
furnaces changes. In addition, volumes of the melt layers in 

the furnaces change. Circulations caused by these changes 
through the channel at the same time bring about the recycling 

of sulfide matte needed in the process from the reduction 
furnace to the converter and recycling of the molten metal 

from the converter to the reduction furnace.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
to be used in processes for producing easily volatile
metals from their sulfides. Known furnace constructions comprise
usually two closely connected furnaces, a reduction furnace and a
converter, which are operated at normal pressure, so that the
material transfer therebetween is arranged to take place
continuously by means of at least one channel provided in
between the furnaces. As a result of chemical reactions taking
place in the furnaces, the hydrostatic pressure of the
furnaces changes. In addition, volumes of the melt layers in
the furnaces change. Circulations via at least one channel
resulting from these changes at the same time bring about
recycling of sulfide matte from the reduction furnace to the
converter, which is needed in the process, as well as the
recycling of molten metal from the converter to the reduction
furnace.Some newer pyrometallurgical processes for producing zinc,
lead, cadmium and some other easily volatile metals utilize the
reduction of the said metal sulfides by means of copper, in
which case there are formed copper matte and vapors of the
metals in question, which are then condensed. In these
processes, copper matte is continuously removed from the
reaction space and transferred to another furnace in order to
oxidize the sulfur contained in the matte and in order to
release the copper back to metallic copper. From the copper
matte processing furnace, there is continuously removed
metallic copper and returned to the said reaction space to
replace the copper consumed in the reduction of metal sulfide. The oxidic substances contained in the raw material, or the
substances that possibly oxidize in the process, form a slag
layer in the furnace which serves as the reaction space, which
slag layer also must be removed either from time to time or
continuously.In order to perform the above described functions, the GB
patent application 2 048 309 utilizes a combination of
furnaces comprising two adjacent reverber-type furnaces, one
of which is located somewhat higher than the other. Concentrate
is fed into a molten copper matte located in the lower
furnace. The zinc sulfide of the concentrate is converted into
metallic zinc, which is volatilized from the furnace. The
copper matte formed in the furnace is recycled by means of a
gas lift through an underpressure chamber to the upper
furnace, where it or at least part thereof is oxidized with
the oxygen supplied into the furnace into metallic copper,
which due to gravity circulates back into
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for producing easily volatile metals such as
zinc, lead and cadmium by means of two closely connected

furnaces (1, 2) operated under normal pressure, wherein a
sulfidic concentrate of at least one easily volatile metal is

fed into a molten metal bath in a reduction furnace (1), where
the easily volatile metals contained in the concentrate are

converted into metallic form and removed from the furnace as
vaporous, a molten metal sulfide matte and slag formed in the

furnace are recycled into a converter (2) in order to convert
the metal sulfide back into metal; a formed slag is discharged

from the converter, and the metal formed in the converter is
recycled to the reduction furnace, whereby the furnaces (1, 2)

are interconnected by means of only one channel (3) having at
least one of its ends being immersed in the melt so that the

recycling of materials in between the furnaces is brought about
by means of the changes caused in the hydrostatic pressure and

volumes of the melt layers (4, 5, 6) by chemical reactions
taking place in the furnaces.
A method according to claim 1,

characterized in that the both ends of the channel (3) are
immersed in the melt.
A method according to claim 1,

characterized in that the employed molten metal is copper.
A method according to claim 1,

characterized in that the reduction furnace and the converter
are located essentially on the same level.
