<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 
unsymmetrical alkyl trisulfides. More particularly, it 
relates to the reaction of an alkyl trisulfide with an 
olefin in the presence of an acidic-type catalyst to 
produce unsymmetrical alkyl trisulfides useful as extreme 
pressure additives in lubricating compositions.  It is well known to prepare symmetrical alkyl 
trisulfides by the reaction of mercaptans with sulfur, 
e.g., U.S. Patent No.'s 3,392,201; 4,564,709 and Canadian 
Patent No. 885,990, utilizing specified conditions and 
catalysts. An article by T. Ghosh and P.D. Bartlett, J. Amer. 
Chem. Soc. 110, 7499-7506 (1988) discloses the reaction 
of phenyl substituted norbornenes or norbornadienes to 
give new trithiolanes by a trisulfide transfer reaction. 
No trisulfide transfer or donor properties with 
unsubstituted norbornanetrithiolanes were noted. A 
methyl substituted trithiolane gave no transfer reaction. This invention is a process comprising reacting a 
terminal or internal branched olefin with a dialkyl 
trisulfide in the presence of an effective amount of an 
acidic-type catalyst for a time sufficient to produce an 
unsymmetrical trisulfide having an alkyl group of the 
trisulfide which is exchanged with said olefin, and the 
product of said process. The process of this invention involves the  
 
preparation of unsymmetrical dialkyl trisulfides and 
mixtures of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dialkyl 
trisulfides by reacting a dialkyl trisulfide with an 
olefin in the presence of an effective amount of a acidic 
catalyst. The general scheme of the process is demonstrated by 
the following equations of alternatively useful 
reactions: 
   where R, R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ are the same or 
different alkyl groups preferably having from 1 to 20 
carbons, provided that in equation 1) at least one of R  
 
and R¹ is different than the radical 
and in 
equation 2) at least one of R and R¹ is different than 
the radical 
The catalyst is an acidic type. The direct products of the reaction process of this 
invention are novel mixtures of symmetrical and 
unsymmetrical trisulfides, and usually a small amount of 
olefin, containing alkyl substituents differing from the 
starting olefin in percentage amounts varying, depending 
on the mole ratio of the reactants. The symmetrical 
trisulfide of the product will differ from the starting 
trisulfide by having different alkyl groups resulting 
from replacement with the olefin reactant. The 
symmetrical and unsymmetrical components may be 
separated, for
