<ABSTRACT>
Silicate melts of pieces of raw material are usually processed further into mineral wool insulating materials. In order to provide a process for the preparation of a silicate melt by means of which all waste materials and secondary raw materials can be recovered or recycled in a simple manner both from an economical and an ecological point of view, it is proposed that hollow glasses filled in advance with fusible (meltable) waste materials be added to the raw material.

Method of producing mineral wool insulating materials of
a silicate melt which is melted from a batch comprising lumpy

raw material supplied to a melting furnace (1) via an upper
dozing apparatus for charging, said melting furnace having a

central pre-heating zone and a lower melting zone, and which
silicate melt is supplied to a defibration unit, with meltable

waste materials being added to said melt as secondary
raw materials,
characterized in

that said waste materials to be supplied as secondary raw
materials are filled in hollow glasses (8, 15) and thereafter

are supplied to said batch, wherein said filled hollow
glasses (8, 15) are introduced at a distance above the melting

zone, at which distance said hollow glasses (8, 15) reach
the melt in a substantially non-melted condition, said distance

being provided at approximately 0.5 to 1 m above the
melting zone.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
portion of filled hollow glasses (8, 15) amounts to 5 to

100%, preferably 25%, referred to the total load.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
salvaged glass bottles or containers are used as hollow

glasses (8, 15).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that mineral wool, shots, filter dusts or salvaged

glass cullets or mixtures thereof are selectively used as
waste materials.
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that the
defibration of the melt is effected according to the Dusel

blowing method. 
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that the
waste materials are admixed additives and/or ingredients for

the correction of the melt composition.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the waste materials, prior to the filling of

the hollow glasses (8, 15), are comminuted and prepared in a
manner such that the same are pourable and/or stuffing.
Method according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that
the preparation of the waste materials is effected in such a

way that a bulk density or a volume weight ≥ 400 kg/m
3
 is
given.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that lumpy waste materials are comminuted up to a

grain size ≤ 3 cm and that additives are ground up to
pourability.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that at the filling of the hollow glasses (8, 15)

a compacting is effected in a ratio ≥ 2 : 1.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that after the filling of the hollow glasses (8,

15) a rapid-hardening sealing is effected, preferably by
applying water glass.
A melting furnace, particularly a shaft furnace or cupola
furnace, for carrying out the method according to one of

the preceding claims, comprising an upper dosing apparatus
for charging lumpy raw material and additives, a central preheating

zone and a lower melting zone, from which lower
melting zone the melt can be supplied to a defibration unit

by means of a tapping action, characterized in that on the
furnace shell casing (1) a means (2-6, 10-12) for introducing

hollow glasses (8, 15) filled with waste materials is provided 
at a distance of approximately 0.5 to 1 m above the

melting zone.
Melting furnace according to claim 12, characterized in
that said means (2-6, 10-12) consists of plural tubes (2)

equally distributed on the periphery of the furnace shell
casing (1), which tubes (2) are provided externally of the

furnace shell casing (1) with cellular wheel sluices (4), so
that said tubes (2) are permanently sealed in a gas-tight

manner.
Melting furnace according to claim 13, characterized in
that said tubes (2) are arranged radially relative to the

furnace shell casing (1) and so as to be outwardly ascending
under an angle of approximately 30 degrees to 60 degrees.
Melting furnace according to claim 13, characterized in
that said tubes (2) are arranged radially and under an angle

of approximately 90
o
 relative to the furnace shell casing
(1), and that the gas-tight sealing is formed by a pneumatically

or hydraulically or electrically driven gusset (11)
that conveys the material to be melted towards the melting

zone.
Melting furnace according to claim 15, characterized in
that the cellular wheel sluice (4) is mounted on the jacket

of the respective tube (2) in such a manner that the delivery
of the material to be melted is introduced immediately into

the action range of said gusset (11).
