<ABSTRACT>
The container (1), which can be used as a disposable and as a reusable container, for transporting and storing liquids has as its main components an inner container (2) which is made of plastic as a blow-moulded item of rectangular contour and rounded corners and is fitted with a filling nozzle (3), which can be closed by a screw cap (4), and a removal tap connected to an outlet nozzle (5) in the bottom region, a casing (8) of zinc-coated sheet metal with an operating opening (9) for the removal tap, and a pallet (10) designed as a flat bottom tray (11) of sheet metal with length and width dimensions complying to European standards for the positive-locking receiving of the plastic inner container (2). The sheet-metal casing (8) has a peripheral constriction in the lower region for supporting the bottom region of the inner container (2) together with the bottom tray (11) of the pallet (10).

Container for transporting and storing liquids,
with a plastic inner container (2) manufactured as a

blow-moulded part, which has a lockable filling
aperture and a discharge and washing aperture to be

connected to a discharge valve (7), has a discharge
base (12), and stands in a flat base trough (11), made

of sheet steel or plastic and adapted to the discharge
base (12) of the inner container, on a pallet (10), and

with a steel casing (8) adjacent to the inner container
(2), the base trough (11) being configured as a pallet

(10) and having groove-like reinforcing beads (16a,
16b), the bases (17) of which lie in a common

horizontal plane (18-18) and which form chambers (19)
in the base trough (11) which are open or closed

downwards, the base trough (11) having an outer
supporting edge (15) drawn downwards and which forms a

hollow support collar (20), and being fastened to a
pallet frame (30) made of metal, wood or plastic,


characterised in that
 the steel casing (8) has a
circumferential constriction (23) to support the arched

section of the base region (6) of the inner container
(2) between its perpendicular side walls and its flat

base, together with the hollow support collar of the
base trough (11) of the pallet (10), and has a lower

supporting edge (24) joining on to the constriction
(23), which edge sits on the pallet and is riveted 

and/or screwed to the base trough (11) and/or the base
frame (30) of the pallet (10).
Container according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the upper edge (31) of the steel casing (8) is
profiled as a supporting edge for the pallet (10) of a

stacked container (1).
Container according to one of claims 1 to 2,

characterised by
 a removable protective cover (32) made
of sheet steel which has an access aperture (33) to the

filler neck (3) of the inner container (2) and is
screwed or riveted to the upper edge (31) of the steel

casing (8).
Container according to one of claims 1 to 2,

characterised by
 a removable protective and stiffening
frame (41) which is screwed to the upper edge (31) of

the steel casing (8).
Container according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the discharge base (12) of the
inner container (2) runs with a slight incline from the

rearward edge (6a) to the front edge (6b) of the base
region (6), on which a connection piece (5) is arranged

to be connected to a discharge and washing tap (7).
Container according to claim 5, 
characterised in
that
 the discharge base (12) of the inner container (2) 
has an incline from the two side edges (6c, 6d) of the

base region (6) towards the centre of the base and
forms a central flat discharge channel (13).
