<ABSTRACT>
A stabilized crocetin-containing colorant which has as 
an effective component a crocetin included by cyclodextrin. 

This colorant is imparted with resistance against light and 
various chemicals to crocetin, which is a hydrolysate of 

crocin, the main component of the carotenoid gardenia yellow 
pigment. The colorant may be added to various food products 

for use of crocetin as a stable coloring matter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crocetin-containing
colorant, and specifically it relates to a crocetin-containing
colorant which has been stabilized by forming an inclusion
complex with cyclodextrin. Crocetin is a derivative of a
yellow pigment found in plants such as gardenia and the like,
and according to the present invention it is stabilized to
widen the range of its use as a colorant.A method is known for stabilizing gardenia pigment (crocin)
by its inclusion complex with cyclodextrin (Japanese Patent
Publication No. 60-45229), but no method has been heretofore
known for the stabilization of crocetin for its use
as a pigment, which is an object of the present invention.Crocetin is a hydrolysate of crocin, the main component
of the carotenoid gardenia yellow pigment, and it is
particularly unstable with respect to light and chemicals.
Methods have been proposed to improve its properties, such as
adding low concentrations of ascorbic acid thereto, but the
methods of use thereof are placed under strict control, and
furthermore at present satisfactory results cannot be obtained. An object of the present invention is to impart to
crocetin resistance against light and chemicals for its
stability, thus providing a method for its use as a colorant.Fig. 1 is a graph showing the results of a light
fastness test against fluorescent light.Fig. 2 is a graph showing the results of a light
fastness test against ultraviolet light.The present invention relates to a crocetin-containing
colorant having as an effective component a crocetin included
by cyclodextrin.Crocetin is obtained by hydrolyzing crocin, which is
extracted from the above mentioned plant, but commercially
available products (for example, products of Sigma, Inc.) may
be used.Also, cyclodextrin (hereunder sometimes abbreviated to
"CD") is a cyclic oligosaccharide with a polymerization degree
of 6-8 which is obtained by allowing cyclodextrin
glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2. 4. 1. 19) to act on starch
or a hydrolysate thereof, and specific examples thereof
include α-, β-, γ-CD and mixtures thereof, or mixtures of
these and dextrin. According to the present invention, α-CD
alone and substances containing it are particularly suitable. A crocetin-containing colorant according to the present
invention may be obtained in the following manner.First, a prescribed amount of crocetin which has been
dissolved in an alkaline solution containing sodium hydroxide,
etc. is added to CD, particularly α-CD, which has been
kneaded into a paste form with a small
