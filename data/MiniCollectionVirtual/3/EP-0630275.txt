<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for the formulation of fibrin sealant in a single delivery system. The method involves mixing a fibrinogen/Factor XIII precipitate solution with thrombin under conditions such that thrombin clotting activity is inhibited and said mixture is applied to a body site under conditions which activate the thrombin to convert fibrinogen into fibrin sealant. A single device, syringe or container, can be used to apply the fibrin sealant formulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FIBRIN SEALANT DELIVERY METHOD BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis is a continuation-in-part application of Serial No. 07/460,379 filed on January 3, 1990, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirity.Technical FieldThe present invention relates to a method of fibrin sealant preparation and delivery, which permits use of a single delivery device. The method may be used for autologous, single-donor, pooled- donor or cell culture-derived fibrin sealant for various human and veterinary surgical procedures. The invention further relates to a kit suitable for use in such a method.BACKGROUND INFORMATIONThe blood coagulation system is a complex series of proteins and factors which are activated sequentially to produce a fibrin gel or clot. In the final stages of the process, fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to generate fibrin monomer, which rapidly polymerizes and is cross-linked by activated Factor XIII to form a fibrin matrix.Preparations of human coagulation factors, including fibrinogen and thrombin, have been used extensively in surgery over the last ten years(Schlag et al (eds) , Fibrin Sealant in Operative Medicine, vol 1-7, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg). These biological fibrin sealants promote hemostasis and wound healing by sealing leakage from tissues, sutures, staples, and prostheses, and are 

particularly useful during open heart surgery in heparinized patients. The sealants also have use as an adhesive for the bonding of tissues and they reduce the amount of blood required for transfusions by controlling intraoperative bleeding. Their effectiveness is reflected in the extensive range of surgical applications for which they have been used, including cardiovascular surgery, plastic surgery, orthopedics, urology, obstetrics and gynecology, dentistry, maxillofacial and ophthalmic surgery.Fibrin sealant products prepared from pooled human plasma fibrinogen/Factor XIII are available commercially in Europe (Tissucol/Tisseel, I muno AG, Vienna, Austria and Beriplast P, Hoechst, West Germany) but such products have not received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. As an alternative, some hospitals are preparing fibrin sealant in-house using the patient's own blood (autologous) or single-donor (homologous) plasma as a source of fibrinogen and Factor XIII.The plasma fibrinogen/Factor XIII component of fibrin sealant is typically prepared by freezing plasma at a temperature below -20*C overnight, slowly thawing the material at 0-4°C, centrifuging, and transferring the cryopreci itate to a syringe

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of effecting the formation of fibrin sealant at a body site comprising: i) mixing, in a container means, an aqueous solution comprising fibrinogen. Factor XIII and mature thrombin under conditions such that thrombin clotting activity is inhibited; and ii) applying a preparation resulting from step (i) to said body site under conditions such that thrombin clotting activity is restored and said fibrin sealant is formed.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein step (i) is carried out at a pH of less than 5.5, whereby thrombin clotting activity is inhibited.
3. The method according to claim 2 wherein, in step (ii) , the pH of said preparation resulting from step (i) is increased such that thrombin clotting activity is restored.
4. The method according to claim 3 wherein the pH of said preparation resulting from step (i) is increased upon contact of said preparation with body fluids of said patient present at said body site.
5. The method according to claim 3 wherein, in step (ii) , the pH of said preparation resulting from step (i) is increased upon contact with a buffer capable of increasing the pH. 


 6. The method according to claim 1 wherein said solution of step (i) includes an amount of a photosensitive inhibitor of thrombin clotting activity sufficient to inhibit thrombin clotting activity.
7. The method according to claim 6 wherein, in step (ii) , said preparation resulting from step (i) is irradiated with light of a wavelength that inactivates said photosensitive inhibitor, whereby thrombin clotting activity is restored.
8. The method according to claim 1 wherein said solution of step (i) includes an amount of a photosensitive inhibitor of thrombin clotting activity and an amount of an irreversible inhibitor of thrombin clotting activity sufficient to inhibit thrombin clotting activity.
9. The method according to claim 8 wherein, in step (ii) , said preparation resulting from step (i) is irradiated with light of a wavelength that inactivates said photosensitive inhibitor, whereby thrombin clotting activity is restored.
10. The method according to claim 1 wherein the conditions of step (i) are such that thrombin clotting activity is inhibited by the absence of calcium ions sufficient to effect fibrin sealant formation. 


 11. The method according to claim 10 wherein, in step (ii) , the conditions are such that calcium ions sufficient to effect fibrin sealant formation are present.
12. The method according to claim 10 wherein said solution of step (i) includes an amount of a chelator of calcium sufficient to reduce free calcium ions in said solution to a level insufficient to effect fibrin sealant formation.
