<ABSTRACT>
The direction of polarisation @ and that of the radiofrequency field @1 are kept parallel to each other and perpendicular to the field @0 to be measured. Means are provided for securing the polariser to the coil which generates @1. The assembly is set into rotation by a piezoelectric motor. Application to the measurement of weak magnetic fields such as the earth's magnetic field.

Optical pumping, resonance magnetometer comprising a cell (10) filled
with a gas (12), whereof the atoms have a gyromagnetic ratio γ, said cell

being placed in an ambient magnetic field (Bo), which is the field to be
measured, a light source (14) emitting a light beam (15), a linear polarizer

(16) through which said beam (15) passes and giving said beam a linear
polarization in a first direction (D
1
), the linearly polarized beam (17) then
passing through the cell (10), a photodetector (24) receiving the light beam

(18) which has passed through the cell (10), said photodetector (24)
supplying an electric signal, means (56) for applying a radio frequency field

(B
1
) to the cell (10), said field having a second direction (D
2
) and a
certain frequency, means (21, 22) for coupling said frequency to the Larmor

frequency F = γBo, a means (26) for measuring said frequency (F), the
amplitude of the ambient magnetic field (Bo) being deduced from the frequency

(F) by the relation Bo = F/γ, said magnetometer also being 
characterized in
that
 it comprises means for mechanically joining to the polarizer (16) the
means (56) for applying the radio frequency field (B
1
) to the cell and
coupling means (40) acting on the mechanical joining means, said means having

a synchronous detection circuit (42) receiving the electric signal supplied
by the photodetector (24) and a reference signal (V
RF
) at the frequency F of
the radio frequency field, the electric signal comprising two components A
1

and A
2
 respectively at the Larmor frequency and double the Larmor frequency,
the circuit (42) detecting the amplitude |A
1q
| of the components A1 at the
Larmor frequency (F), in phase quadrature with the reference signal (V
RF
),
said amplitude being used for controlling means (46) for rotating the

mechanical joining means in such a way that as a consequence the polarizer
(16) and means (56) for applying the radio frequency field are simultaneously

rotated.
Magnetometer according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the amplitude
|A2| of the signal at twice the Larmor frequency is not zero and 
in that
 the
rectilinear polarization direction (D1) of the beam (15) is parallel to the

direction (D2) of the radio frequency field (
B
1
).
Magnetometer according to one of the claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

the radio frequency generating means (56) are constituted by a single coil.
Magnetometer according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 the means (46) for rotating the assembly constituted by the polarizer
and the radio frequency field generating means (56) are constituted by a

piezoelectric motor.
