<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the optical inspection of 
samples of particulate material and in particular, the 
the preparation and presentation of such samples for 
optical inspection. Optical inspection can be used to determine properties 
of particulate material, for example colour and 
reflectivity. One particular application of optical 
quality measurement is in monitoring the cosmetic 
quality of synthetic diamond crystals that are to be 
used as abrasive material. In one known measurement 
system, a sample is placed in a pot, that is to say an 
open container, and the exposed surface of the material 
is inspected by a suitable optical measurement device. 
Usually, the sample surface is uneven, and its height 
relative to the measurement device is inconstant, 
depending on the size of the particles. In the case of 
saw diamond abrasive, even though each sample is taken 
from a specific size range, there is still a variation 
of size and shape of particles within the sample. The 
resulting uneven sample surface and variations in 
surface height relative to the measurement device 
materially reduce the accuracy and repeatability of the 
measurement results, and measurement on one sample may 
not be readily comparable with measurements on other 
samples. FR-A-1 375 321 discloses a device in which a fibre sample is 
pressed onto the transparent bottom of a container by a pneumatic piston 
head to enable repeatable optical inspection through said transparent window.  
 An object of the present invention is to improve the 
repeatability and accuracy of optical inspection 
measurements on particulate material, and in particular 
to provide for improved presentation of samples for 
optical inspection. According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided a method of preparing a sample of particulate 
material comprising placing the said material in an open 
container, providing a reference surface at a 
predetermined position, moving the container thereby 
bringing an exposed surface of the particulate material 
therein into intimate contact with the reference 
surface, holding the container in the position thus 
defined, and removing the reference surface, thereby 
presenting said sample with an exposed surface which is 
substantially even and located at a predetermined 
position defined by said reference surface. According to another aspect of the invention there is 
provided apparatus for the optical inspection of 
particulate material, comprising a support, an open 
sample container mounted for

A method of preparing a sample of particulate 
material comprising placing the said material in an open 

container, providing a reference surface at a 
predetermined position, moving the cont
ainer thereby 
bringing an exposed surface of the particulate material 

therein into intimate contact with the reference 
surface, holding the container in the position thus 

defined, and removing the reference surface, thereby 
presenting said sample with an exposed surface which is 

substantially even and located at a predetermined 
position defined by said reference surface. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
particulate material is urged against the reference 

surface thereby compacting the particulate material. 
The method claimed in claim 1 or 2, further 
comprising the step of optically inspecting the exposed 

surface of the particulate material disposed at the said 
position, by optical inspection means disposed in 

predetermined manner relative to said position. 
Apparatus for the optical inspection of particulate 
material, comprising a support, an open sample  

 
container mounted for movement in height relative to the 

support, a reference member having an undersurface 
placed at a predetermined height relative to the support 

and such that the sample of particulate material 
previously placed in the container can be raised into 

contact of the said undersurface, and means for holding 
the container in the position defined by such contact, 

the reference member being movable away from the 
container at said position to permit subsequent optical 

inspection of the exposed surface of the sample at the 
said position. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, further including 
means for urging the container towards the reference 

member, for compacting the sample against the said 
undersurface. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 in which the 
container has an internal bottom surface profiled to 

provide between it and the said undersurface a pressure 
distribution adapted for levelling the upper surface of 

the sample. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 5 or 6 in which the 
reference member is rotatable about a vertical axis for 

levelling the surface of the sample.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 5, 6, or 7 further 
including optical inspection means disposed or 

disposable at a predetermined height relative to the 
said position for inspecting the sample surface after 

removal of the reference member. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8 in which the 
reference member is mounted on a carrier which is 

removable from the support, the carrier and support 
being provided with cooperating locating means such that 

when the carrier is located on the support the reference 
member has its undersurface at the set predetermined 

level, the said apparatus further including a further 
carrier similarly disposable removably on the support 

and carrying optical inspection means arranged to 
inspect the sample surface when the further carrier is 

disposed on the support, whereby the sample surface is 
always presented to the optical inspection means in a 

predetermined relationship determined by the reference 
member. 
An optical inspection apparatus for particulate 
material, comprising a body, a container movably 

supported in the body for containing a sample of said 
material, a reference member having a reference and  

 
compaction surface on its underside and locatable above 

the container with the said surface at a predetermined 
position, and means for moving the container containing 

a said sample towards the said member when the latter is 
so located, thereby urging a said sample against the 

said surface, and means for holding the container in the 
thus-defined position when the said member is removed, 

so as to leave a compacted and even sample surface 
exposed for optical inspection. 
An optical inspection apparatus as claimed in claim 
10, wherein the container is removably supported on a 

platform which has its lower portion in the form of a 
plunger slidably received in a vertical hole in the body. 
An optical inspection apparatus as claimed in claim 
11, wherein the platform is urged upwards by a spring 

acting between the plunger and a part of the body. 
An optical inspection apparatus as claimed in claim 
12, wherein the upward motion of the platform is subject 

to mechanical damping. 
An optical inspection apparatus as claimed in any 
one of claims 10 to 13, wherein the container has a  

 
circular opening and the lower portion of the said 

member providing the said surface is circular and is 
arranged to close the container when the container is 

moved towards the said member. 
An optical inspection apparatus as claimed in claim 
14, wherein said lower portion of the said member 

providing the said surface is rotatable about an axis 
perpendicular to the said surface. 
An optical inspection apparatus as claimed in any 
one of claims 10 to 15, wherein the base of the
