<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for testing components of a system for transmitting data from a first computer system to a second computer system are described. The data are transmitted and received via a transmission system. For the purpose of transmitting and receiving, the connected computer systems contain a test tool in which the associated commands are processed. The commands represent a test description and are initially input into the test tool by a user. In distinction from the known prior art in which the commands are compiled before the test run, the commands according to the invention are only processed interpretatively during the test run, that is to say the commands are only converted into the corresponding functions during the test run. This has the advantage that a user can modify and/or extend the commands and the data during the test run.
