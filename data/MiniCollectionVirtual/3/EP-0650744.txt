<ABSTRACT>
A cabinet (5) containing electrical or electronic 
components or equipment such as printed circuit boards 

(12) is protected against fire by a water spray system. 
The water spray system comprises spray pipes (12,14,16 and 

18) carrying respective spray nozzles (24) and supplied 
with pressurised water. Two of the spray pipes (12,14) 

are arranged across the front of the cabinet (20) so that 
the water sprays from their respective nozzles (24) are 

directed towards each other across a void at the front of 
the cabinet. The sprays from the nozzle (24) on one of 

these pipes (12) thus collide with the sprays from the 
nozzles (24) on the other pipe (14). In addition, the 

sprays from adjacent nozzles collide with each other. The 
other two spray pipes (16,18) are similarly arranged, and 

similar collisions occur there. Multiple re-direction of 
the sprays takes place in response to each such collision 

and this causes the water sprays to penetrate the 
interstices between the circuit boards (12) and other 

components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fire suppression system for 
suppressing fires within a cluttered area, comprising 
nozzle means within the area for producing a plurality of 
water jets arranged to collide with each other. The 
invention also relates to a method of fire suppression for 
suppressing fires within a cluttered area, comprising the 
steps of producing a plurality of water jets within the 
enclosure which are arranged to collide with each other. Such a system and method are known from GB-A-1 483 041. 
The invention aims to provide a system and method having 
improved effectiveness. According to the invention, the known system is 
characterised in that the nozzle means comprises water 
spray means for producing the water jets in the form of 
water sprays, in that at least some of the spray means 
produce water sprays moving in opposite directions into 
collision so as to provide at least a partial re-direction 
of the sprayed water into interstices within the clutter, 
and in that the area is a walled enclosure. According to the invention, the known method is 
characterised in that the water jets are in the form of  
 
water sprays, in that at least some of the sprays move in 
opposite directions into collision so as to provide at 
least a partial re-direction of the sprayed water into 
interstices within the clutter, and in that the area is a 
walled enclosure. Fire suppression systems and methods according to the 
invention and for suppressing fires in cabinets containing 
telecommunications or other electronics equipment will now 
be described, by way of example only, with reference to 
the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective front view of the cabinet with 
its door removed; Figure 2 is a top view of the inside of the cabinet (that 
is, with the top of the cabinet removed); and Figures 3 and 4 show diagrams of water sprays in the 
cabinet (the structure of the cabinet being omitted). The cabinet 5, in which fires are to be detected and 
suppressed, is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 as 
containing electronic circuits which, in this example, 
take the form of racks 6 and 10 of printed circuit boards 
12. The arrangement of the racks and the printed circuit  
 
boards is shown purely by way of example and will 
obviously vary widely. The Figures show the cabinet as 
being substantially fully occupied by the racks of printed 
circuit boards. However, in other examples it would be 
less fully occupied. Instead of all or some of the racks 
of the printed circuit

A fire suppression system for suppressing fires 
within a cluttered area (5), comprising nozzle means 

(12,14,16,18) within the area for producing a plurality of 
water jets arranged to collide with each other, 

characterised in that the nozzle means comprises water 
spray means (12,14,16,18) for producing the water jets in 

the form of water sprays, in that at least some of the 
spray means (e.g. 12,14;16,18) produce water sprays moving 

in opposite directions into collision so as to provide at 
least a partial re-direction of the sprayed water into 

interstices within the clutter, and in that the area is a 
walled enclosure (5). 
A system according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the walled enclosure (5) is sufficiently confined to 

create turbulence within the enclosure. 
A system according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in

direction. 
A system according to any preceding claim,
