<ABSTRACT>
It is known to use rotating drums in photographic processing apparatus. However, in many embodiments, relatively large volumes of processing solution are required for effective operation of the apparatus. This makes most drum arrangements unsuitable for use with unstable chemistry and single use chemistry as the processing solutions need to be replaced frequently. Described herein is an improvement to the surface (24) of a drum (20) in photographic processing apparatus incorporating a drum arrangement to form a low volume processing tank. The improvement comprises forming a spiral (22) either on or in the surface (24) of the drum (20). This has the advantage of improving the process activity of the apparatus and prevents the material being processed from adhering to the drum surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
processing apparatus and is more particularly 
concerned with the processing of small areas of 
photographic material, for example, prints on 
photographic paper. It is well-known to use rotating drums in 
photographic processing apparatus. US-A-4 613 223 
discloses an arrangement in which a flexible sheet of 
photographic material is driven along an endless 
curved path within a processing tank by passing the 
sheet through nips formed between at least one pair of 
driven rollers. At least one of the driven rollers is 
the drum itself. During processing, the emulsion 
(sensitive) surface of the sheet is arranged not to 
come into contact with any stationary part of the 
processing vessel as it is being processed. This 
prevents damage to the surface during processing. 
After driving the sheet around the endless path for a 
predetermined number of cycles, which defines the 
processing time, the sheet is then directed out of the 
processing tank. The arrangement described above, has the 
disadvantage that little or no agitation is applied to 
the emulsion surface of the photographic material 
being processed. This may result in uneven processing 
of the material and variable sensitometry. Furthermore, relatively large volumes of 
processing solution are required which makes the 
arrangement disclosed unsuitable for unstable 
processing chemistry and single use chemistry as large 
volumes of processing solutions need to be discarded 
on a regular basis. US-A-2 605 684 discloses an arrangement in 
whcih helically wound grooves formed on rollers are 
used to transfer processing solution from a reservoir  
 
and to apply the solution to photographic material 
being processed. A small portion of the surface of 
each grooved roller is used to effect such transfer 
and application. US-A-3 943 541 discloses an arrangement in 
which a helically grooved roller is used to apply 
processing solution to photographic material being 
processed. In this arrangement, processing solution 
is applied to the surface of the roller from a tank, 
the material being processed passing over the tank and 
then roller in turn during processing. Co-pending British Patent Application No. 
9125297.3 (now published International Patent 
Application No. WO93/11464) discloses a rotating drum 
arrangement in which low volumes of processing 
solutions are used allowing unstable and single use 
chemistry to be efficiently used. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a drum surface for

<CLAIMS>
Photographic processing apparatus for 
processing photographic material (30), the apparatus 

comprising:- 

a drum (20; 50) rotatable about its axis (26; 
58) for applying processing solution to the 

photographic material (30), the drum (20; 50) having a 
surface (24; 52) with at least one helically wound 

groove (22; 54, 56) formed thereon for distributing 
processing solution over the surface (24; 52) of the 

drum (20; 50), each helically wound groove (22; 54, 
56) having an axis which lies substantially coincident 

with the axis (26; 58) of the drum (20; 50); 
at least one reservoir for storing 
processing solution; and 
application means (40; 60) connected to said 
at least one reservoir for applying processinq 

solution to the surface (22, 24; 52, 54, 56) of the 
drum (20; 50) for subsequent application to the 

material (30) being processed; 
 
   characterized in that the application means 

comprises a single feed orifice (40; 60) positioned 
above the surface (22, 24; 52, 54, 56) of the drum 

(20; 50) for pumping processing solution onto the 
surface (22, 24; 52, 54, 56) of the drum (20; 50). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein 
the single feed orifice (40) is positioned at one end 

of the drum (20). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein 
the single feed orifice (60) is positioned at the 

centre of the drum (50). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein 
two helically wound grooves (54, 56) are provided 

which extend in opposite directions from the centre of 
the drum (50).  

 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, further including at least one drain 

orifice (42; 62, 64) for removing processing solution 
from the vicinity of the drum (20; 50). 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein each helically wound groove 

(22; 54, 56) is formed as a groove cut into the 
surface (24; 52) of the drum (20; 50). 
Apparatus according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, wherein each helically wound groove 

(22; 54, 56) is formed as a raised portion on the 
surface (24; 52) of the drum (20; 50). 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the feed orifice is formed 

as part of a vessel surrounding the drum (20; 50).
