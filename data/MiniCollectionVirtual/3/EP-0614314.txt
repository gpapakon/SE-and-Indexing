<ABSTRACT>
A casing for an audiovisual equipment presents 
an outer appearance giving the impression of integrating 

a hole area formed of a plurality of sound transmitting 
fine holes with the casing, thereby making the hole area 

unnoticeable. This allows a viewer to easily concentrate 
on the screen by eliminating anything noticeable from the 

area surrounding the screen, and also gives the outside 
of the casing a luxurious appearance. In order to make 

the hole area unnoticeable, maintain good volume and 
quality of sound from the speaker, and arrange the 

diameter ød mm of the tapered fine holes to be 
practically the smallest, the relationship between the 

diameter ød mm and the thickness T mm of the casing must 
be expressed by the following formula: (1/6) x T mm ≦ ød 

mm ≦ 0.5 mm. When the fine holes are formed to be 
straight, the relationship between the diameter øds mm 

and the thickness tmm of the casing must be expressed by 
the following formula: (1/5) x t mm ≦ øds mm ≦ 0.5 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a casing (cabinet)
for an audiovisual apparatus, which casing has holes
through which sound is transmitted to the exterior of the
apparatus from a built-in speaker, and also to a method
of producing the same.Nowadays, in television receivers having built-in
speakers, many attempts are made to make the area
comprising numerous sound transmitting holes (hereinafter
simply referred to as "the hole area") less noticeable
in order to present an attractive outer appearance
and which gives the impression of integrating the hole
area with the casing. One object of such attempts is to
allow a viewer to easily concentrate on the screen by
eliminating anything noticeable from the area surrounding
the screen and another object is to give the outside
of the casing a luxurious appearance. In addition to
these objects, another object of the present invention is
to eliminate a separation process for recycling audiovisual
apparatuses.Fig 9 shows one example of conventional hole areas
which are constructed as follows. A speaker net 40
having good air permeability adheres to a punched
sheet 41 having numerous holes 42, each with a diameter
greater than 0.5mm. The resultant member is attached
to a plurality of sound transmitting holes 43, each
having a diameter of approximately 3mm, which holes
are arranged on the front or side surface of a casing
(cabinet) 50 of a television receiver.However, the above construction presents the following
problems. Since the speaker net 40 cannot be
formed of the same resin material as the casing, but
must be formed of a fibre material or a metal gauze, it
must be separated when the audiovisual apparatus is
recycled. Moreover, the fibrous speaker net is expensive,
and also, a considerable amount of time is required
for attaching the speaker net to the punched sheet and
the casing.In a small audiovisual apparatus which is directly
provided with numerous sound transmitting holes in a
cabinet thereof, the diameter of the holes is large relative
to the thickness of the casing. For example, the
holes have a diameter of approximately 1mm to 2mm relative
to the casing having a thickness from 0.5mm to
1.6mm. Thus, the sound transmitting holes forming the
hole area are obviously noticeable and conspicuous in
terms of the outer appearance of the apparatus.Even in a large casing, such as a television receiver,
no attempts have been made to decrease the diameter
of the holes until they become substantially unnoticeable.One of the reasons for this is given below.
