<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to acrylate-based thermoplastic elastomers comprising at least 40% by weight and up to 100% by weight of one or more combpolymers KP having a molecular weight of greater than 50,000 daltons which are built up from   alpha ) 5-50% by weight of macromonomers MM built up from methyl methacrylate or copolymers of methyl methacrylate with comonomers selected from the group consisting of further methacrylates, acrylates and styrenes, containing a terminal unit with a free-radical-polymerisable group having a glass transition temperature Tg of at least 60 degrees C and a molecular weight in the range of from 500 to 100,000 daltons and a refractive index nD in the range from 1.48 to 1.50, and beta ) from 5 to 90% by weight (based on all the monomers in the KP) of monomers or monomer mixtures of the formula I
