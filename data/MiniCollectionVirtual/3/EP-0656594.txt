<ABSTRACT>
A word processor with a display. Normally characters 
are display on the display in the same form as the characters 

will appear in when printed out. However, characters to be 
provided with an enhancement feature, but which are determined, 

based on the type of character enhancement and on the 
display character size, to be impossible to effectively 

display on the display with the enhancement feature, are 
displayed in a manner that allows an operator to recognize 

which characters are provided with enhancement features, but 
which can not be effectively displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a word processor
capable of printing characters, such as alphanumeric characters
and symbols, with one or more character modifications or
enhancements, such as underline, shadow, bold, italic, and
the like, and more particularly to the word processor having
a display and a display function for displaying characters
with character enhancement so as to appear the same on the
display as when printed out.There has been known a conventional word processor
for producing text with alphanumeric characters, symbols, and
the like (referred to as characters hereinafter) in the
Japanese language, the English language, and the like. The
word processor includes basically a display capable of
displaying several rows of text data, a keyboard, and a print
mechanism having a dot print type print head. Text data of
inputted characters is displayed on the display in the form
of dot matrixes at a predetermined character size. When the
inputted text data is to be printed, the text data is printed
on a print sheet based on preset format information that
includes the size of print characters, the inter-character
pitch, and the row spacing. Such word processors have a layout display function
for showing the layout of inputted text data. Recently, some
word processors have a print image display function added to
the layout display function so that images of characters are
displayed on the display in the same form as the characters
will appear in when printed out.Using this print image display function, a print
image of a character will be displayed on the display based
on a preset inter-character pitch and row spacing, and at a
character display size that corresponds to the preset
character print size. Also, when optional character enhancement
commands are provided in text data, the characters to be
enhanced are displayed on the display as their printed image
would appear, that is, as enhanced characters according to
the type of character enhancement included in the text data.
Examples of character enhancement include outline, bold
print, shadow (refer to Fig. 1A), shadow-added (refer to Fig.
1B), italics, and underline. Sometime characters can not be
effectively displayed in enhanced form. For example, when
characters are to be printed at a small size, and therefore
will be displayed at a small size, then enhanced form of
character becomes illegible. Another example of ineffective
display would be when some enhancement features, such as
outline or shadow-added, become indiscernible on the

<CLAIMS>
A word processor for producing text containing a
plurality of characters, such as symbols and alphanumeric

characters, into a form suitable for printing, the word
processor comprising:


display dot pattern data memory means (53) for storing
display dot pattern data that corresponds to each of the

plurality of characters;
input means (3) for inputting a variety of commands and
characters of the plurality of characters;
data memory means (61) for storing data that represents
the inputted characters inputted through the input means (3);
character format setting means for setting a character
size (SZ) with which the inputted characters represented by

data in the data memory means (61) are to be printed and for
setting a type (MD) of character enhancement with which the

inputted characters represented by data in the data memory
means (61) are to be printed;
print means (PM) for receiving and printing data in the
memory means (61) with the character size (SZ) and the

type (MD) of character enhancement, both set by the
character format setting means;
display dot image production means for retrieving,
from the display dot pattern data memory means (53), display dot

pattern data that corresponds to the inputted characters
represented by the data in the data memory means (61), and for

producing enhanced display dot image data for the inputted
characters with the type (MD) of character enhancement set by the

character format setting means; 
display means (22) for receiving and displaying enhanced
display dot image data produced by the display dot image

production means;
enhanced character effective display determination
means for determining whether each of the inputted characters

with character enhancement can be effectively displayed by
the display means (22) based on the type (MD) of character enhancement

set for each of the inputted characters by the character
format setting means, and based on a display character size (SZ)

for each of the inputted character
set by the character

format means; and
enhanced display cancellation means for receiving
output from the enhanced character effective display determination

means and canceling production in the display dot
image production means of enhanced display dot image data for

the inputted characters determined by the enhanced character
effective display determination means to be impossible to

effectively display in enhanced form.
A word processor as claimed in claim 1 further
comprising a differentiation dot pattern data production

means for producing differentiation dot pattern data for the
inputted characters for which production of enhanced display

dot image data is canceled by the enhanced display cancellation
means, the differentiation dot pattern data, when 

displayed by the display means (22), allowing an operator to
recognize which characters are provided with character

enhancement.
A word processor as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
differentiation dot pattern data production means produces

differentiation dot pattern data which causes the inputted
characters for which production of enhanced display dot image

data is canceled by the enhanced display cancellation means

to be displayed in an inverse display.
A word processor as claimed in claim 3 wherein the
inverse display is produced by reversing values of bits that

constitute display dot pattern data corresponding to the
inputted characters for which production of enhanced display

dot image data is canceled by the enhanced display cancellation
means.
A word processor as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
differentiation dot pattern data production means produces

differentiation dot pattern data which causes the inputted
characters for which production of enhanced display dot image

data is canceled by the enhanced display cancellation means
to be displayed with an overhead line.
A word processor as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
differentiation dot pattern data production means produces

differentiation dot pattern data which causes the inputted
characters for which production of enhanced display dot image 

data is canceled by the enhanced display cancellation means
to be displayed with an overlying strike out mark.
A word processor as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
differentiation dot pattern data production means produces

differentiation dot pattern data which causes the inputted
characters for which production of enhanced display dot image

data is canceled by the enhanced display cancellation means
to be displayed in a blinking image.
A word processor as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein display dot image production means retrieves,

from the display dot pattern data memory means (53), display dot
pattern data that corresponds to the inputted characters

determined by the enhanced character effective display
determination means to be impossible to effectively display

in enhanced form, so that characters are displayed without
character enhancement.
