Metal sheeting/polyurethane adhesive layer/polypropylene 
copolymer plastic film composite in which 

the adhesive layer is obtained from a solvent-containing 
two-component polyurethane adhesive, 

characterized in that the polypropylene copolymer 
plastic film essentially or fully comprises random 

polypropylene copolymer obtainable by random 
copolymerisation of from 1 to 8% by weight of ethylene 

and/or further α-monoolefins, with the exception of 
propylene, and from 99 to 92% by weight of propylene, 

based on the total weight of the monomer composition, 
the polypropylene copolymer having a molecular weight 

distribution M

:M
n
 in the range from 2 to 8 and a melt 
flow index MFI 230°C/2.16 kg in the range from 5 to 

10 g/10 min, preferably in the range from 6 to 
10 g/10 min. 
Metal sheeting/polyurethane adhesive layer/polypropylene 
copolymer plastic film composite according 

to Claim 1, characterized in that the random 
polypropylene copolymer is obtained exclusively by 

random copolymerization of ethylene and propylene. 
Metal sheeting/polyurethane adhesive layer/polypropylene 
copolymer plastic film composite according 

to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
polypropylene copolymer plastic film essentially or 

fully comprises random polypropylene copolymer 
comprising from 2 to 4% by weight of ethylene and from 

98 to 96% by weight of propylene, based on the total 
weight of the monomer composition, having a molecular 

weight distribution M
w
:M
n
 in the range from 2 to 5, 
particularly preferably in the range from 3 to 4, and a 

melt flow index MFI 230°C/2.16 kg in the range from 5 
to 10 g/10 min, particularly preferably in the range 

from 7 to 9 g/10 min. 
Metal sheeting/polyurethane adhesive layer/polypropylene 
copolymer plastic film composite according 

to Claim 1 to 3, characterized in that the  
 

polypropylene plastic film contains up to 0.5% by 
weight, based on the total weight of the plastic film, 

of erucamide and/or oleamide and up to 0.2% by weight, 
based on the total weight of the plastic film, of 

antiblocking agent, preferably SiO2 [sic], and if 

desired, antioxidants and, if desired, further 
processing stabilizers and further additives. 
Metal sheeting/polyurethane adhesive layer/polypropylene 
copolymer plastic film composite according 

to Claim 1 to 4, characterized in that the two-component 
polyurethane adhesive used is a hydroxyl 

group-containing polyester in which the carboxylic acid 
component is essentially or fully isophthalic acid 

and/or terephthalic acid, and an isocyanate group-containing 
polyurethane prepolymer composition based on 

tolylene diisocyanate. 
Process for the production of the metal 
sheeting/polyurethane adhesive layer/polypropylene 

copolymer plastic film composite according to Claim 1 
to 5, characterized in that the two-component 

polyurethane adhesive is applied to the metal sheeting, 
and the polypropylene plastic film is laminated onto 

the heated, adhesive-coated metal sheeting. 
Use of the metal sheeting/polyurethane adhesive 
layer/polypropylene copolymer plastic film composites 

according to Claim 1 to 5, for the production of 
packaging containers.
