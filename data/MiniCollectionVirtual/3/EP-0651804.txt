<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improvement to a process for obtaining antibodies in soluble and correctly folded and assembled form, the improvement comprising the use in the process of a step to raise the operating temperature to an elevated temperature at a time in the process selected to facilitate the subsequent isolation of soluble, correctly folded and assembled antibody substantially free of other antibody related material. The operating temperature may be raised to the elevated temperature at any stage in the microbial fermentation or eukaryotic cell culture, or at any stage during extraction and purification of the antibodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides an improvement to a process for obtaining
antibodies in soluble, correctly folded and assembled form.The rapid developments in recombinant DNA techniques have resulted in
the identification and isolation of many novel genes, some of known function
and some of unknown function. Invariably there is a need to express the
gene in a heterologous cell system in order to produce material for structure-function
studies, diagnostic reagents such as monoclonal or polyclonal
antibodies and material for in vivo activity testing and therapy.Several alternative systems for the expression of foreign genes have been
developed including systems based upon mammalian cells, insect cells,
fungal cells, bacterial cells and transgenic animals or plants. The choice of
expression system for a given gene depends upon the likely features of the
encoded protein, for example any post-translational protein modifications
needed for biological activity, as well as the objective of the study. Other
important considerations for the investigator are the facilities available and
the time and cost involved in generating the amounts of recombinant protein
required.The most widely used and convenient system for the production of foreign
proteins remains that based on the prokaryote Escherichia coli. The
advantages of this system comprise the ease of gene manipulation, the
availability of reagents including gene expression vectors, the ease of
producing quantities of protein (up to a gramme in simple shake-flask
culture), speed and the high adaptability of the system to express a wide
variety of proteins. Expression of any foreign gene in E. coli begins with the insertion of a cDNA
copy of the gene into an expression vector. Many forms of expression
vector are available. Such vectors usually comprise a plasmid origin of DNA
replication, an antibiotic selectable marker and a promoter and
transcriptional terminator separated by a multi-cloning site (expression
cassette) and a DNA sequence encoding a ribosome binding site. The
method of transcriptional regulation varies between the various promoters
now available (ptac, λpL, T7). The ptac and T7 expression based systems
are controlled by the chemical inducer IPTG, whilst the λ promoters are
controlled by a temperature switch.A problem encountered with E. coli based expression systems is the
difficulty of producing material which is acceptable for therapeutic use. The
use of complex media, antibiotic selection and potentially hazardous
inducers such as IPTG may

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of soluble, correctly-folded
antibody molecules, comprising subjecting a

preparation comprising soluble, correctly-folded antibody
molecules and other antibody-related material to a heat

treatment step in order to facilitate the removal of the
other antibody-related material, and thus facilitate

isolation of the soluble, correctly-folded antibody
molecules; wherein said heat treatment step is carried out

at 40 to 60°C.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the
preparation comprising soluble, correctly-folded antibody

molecules and other antibody-related material is the product
of a fermentation comprising culturing a host cell

transformed with an expression vector which encodes at least
part of an antibody light chain and an expression vector

encoding at least part of an antibody heavy chain, such that
at least some of the light chain and heavy chain molecules

are secreted and combine to form soluble, correctly-folded
and assembled antibody.
A process according to claim 2, wherein the
preparation subjected to heat treatment comprises disrupted

cells.
A process according to claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the
heat treatment step is carried out during the expression

phase of the fermentation.
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein
the preparation subjected to heat treatment further

comprises a batch hydrophobic chromatography matrix. 
A process according to Claim 4 comprising the steps
of:


a) culturing a bacterial cell transformed with at
least one expression vector comprising an origin of

replication which is inducible from a repressed state
at a repressive temperature, at which it replicates

at a low copy number, to an induced state at
an elevated permissive temperature, at which it

replicates at a high copy number, and a DNA coding
sequence encoding all or part of an antibody molecule

comprising a light chain polypeptide and a heavy chain
polypeptide under the control of a promoter which is

repressed when the vector is at a low copy number and
of a secretion sequence, in a medium at the repressive

temperature at which the vector is maintained at a low
copy number and recombinant gene expression is not

induced;
b) raising the operating temperature of the culture
medium to the elevated permissive temperature to

induce replication of the vector to high copy number;
c) maintaining the operating temperature of the medium
at the elevated permissive temperature, and
d) optionally collecting the antibody molecule product
expressed into the periplasm of the host cell or the

culture medium.
A process according to any of the preceding claims in
which said antibody molecule is a natural, humanised or

chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof.
A process according to any preceding claim, further
comprising the step of isolating the soluble,

correctly-folded antibody molecules.
