<ABSTRACT>
Methods are described for attaching semiconductor nanocrystals to solid inorganic surfaces, using self-assembled bifunctional organic monolayers as bridge compounds. Two different techniques are presented. One relies on the formation of self-assembled monolayers on these surfaces. When exposed to solutions of nanocrystals, these bridge compounds bind the crystals and anchor them to the surface. The second technique attaches nanocrystals already coated with bridge compounds to the surfaces. Analyses indicate the presence of quantum confined clusters on the surfaces at the nanolayer level. These materials allow electron spectroscopies to be completed on condensed phase clusters, and represent a first step towards synthesis of an organized assembly of clusters. These new products are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SEMICONDUCTOR NANOCRYSTALS COVALENTLY BOUND TO SOLID INORGANIC SURFACES USING SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERSBackground of the Invention Field of the Invention This invention is in the field of semiconductor fabrication techniques. More particularly it involves the binding of semiconductor nanocrystals to solid inorganic surfaces.Background InformationThe ability to assemble molecules into well- defined two- and three-dimensional spatial configurations is a major goal in the field of self assembled monolayers (SAMs) . hitesides, G. M., Chimia (1990) 44.:310-311. Since the discovery that alkane thiols will displace practically any impurity on a gold surface, Nuzzo, R. G. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1983) 105:4481-4483, and will spontaneously create an ordered monolayer of high quality. Porter, M.D. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (198' 109. 3559-3568, interest in these systems has been 

 extensive, Tillman, N. et al. , Langmuir (1989) 5.:1020- 1026, Reubinstein, I. et al., Nature (1988) 32.:426-429, Bravo, B. G. et al., Langmuir (1989) 5.:1092:1095. Recent advances have extended SAMs beyond the prototype gold/thiol systems. Fatty acids on aluminum, Allara, D. L. et al., Langmuir (1985) .1:45-52; silanes on silicon, (a) Maoz, R. et al. , Langmuir (1986) 3_:1045-1051, (b) Maoz, R. et al, Langmuir (1987) 2:1034-1044, (c) asser an, S. R. et al., Langmuir (1989) 5.: 1074-1087; isonitriles on platinum, Hickman, J. M. et al., J. Am.Chem. Soc. (1989) 111:7271-7272; and rigid phosphates on metals, Lee, H. et al. , J. Phvs. Chem. (1988) 92:2597- 2601 are examples. In addition to the wide choice of the substrate, the chemical functionality presented at the top of a monolayer can be controlled by replacing monofunctional alkanes with difunctional organic compounds, (a) Bain, C. D. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1989) 111:7155-7164. (b) Pale-Grosdemange, C. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1991) 113:12-20. Such assemblies can then be used to build up more complex structures in three dimensions, (a) Ulman, A. et al., Langmuir (1989) .5:1418- 1420 (b) Tillman, N. et al., Langmuir (1989) 5_:101-105, enabling chemists to engineer complex organic structures on top of macroscopic surfaces. This specific control over the microscopic details of interfaces has allowed for diverse applications of SAMs. Metals, for example, provide the ideal support for organic compounds with large non-linear optical behavior, and by using SAMs the molecules can be held in specific orientations with respect to the metal, Putvinski, T. M. et al., Langmuir (1990)
