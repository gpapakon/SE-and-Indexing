<ABSTRACT>
A living tissue replacement of crystallized glass having 
bioaffinity and mechanical strength is briefly obtained simply 

by pressure molding or machining without using a special 
equipment. A glass material having a softening point below its 

crystallization temperature and exhibiting viscous flow at 
temperatures below its melting point is heated at a temperature 

above its Tg and pressed at the temperature to mold to a 
desired shape, thereby manufacturing a living tissue 

replacement such as a dental crown. Molding can be done under 
a pressure of up to 20 MPa.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to living tissue replacements such
as artificial dental crowns, artificial dental roots,
artificial bones, bone screws, and artificial air tubes. It
also relates to a method for preparing living tissue
replacements, a glass material and a molding apparatus for use
in the manufacture of living tissue replacements.Various biotic ceramics are used to form living tissue
replacements such as artificial dental crowns, artificial
dental roots, artificial bones, artificial junctions and bone
fillers. Among biotic ceramics, great attention is paid to
crystallized glass or glass-ceramics because of good biological
affinity and high mechanical strength. As to the crystallized
glass for biological use, the following proposals have been
made.Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) No. 69094/1992 proposes
a calcium phosphate system crystallized glass for use as a
dental material comprising CaO, P2O5, and Al, with the Ca/P 
ratio being from 0.35 to 0.49. A shape of glass is formed by
centrifugal casting and then heat treated for crystallization.
Since this method utilizes centrifugal casting for shaping of
glass, the glass must be melted, making it difficult to use a
high strength glass composition having a high melting point.
Then, the crystallized glass of this proposal is less reliable
when applied to living tissue replacements which receive
substantial impacts in a repetitive manner. In fact, the
calcium phosphate system crystallized glass examples disclosed
in the publication are not regarded satisfactory in mechanical
strength and a substantial amount of glass component leaches
out. The casting process is difficult to ensure dimensional
precision since glass experiences considerable shrinkage upon
cooling. The casting process also allows bubbles to be
introduced into the glass which is then insufficient in
strength, often resulting in defective parts due to bubble
inclusion. The crystallized glass of this proposal raises
problems particularly when applied to artificial dental crowns.
While artificial dental roots need not have a shape and size
specific to an individual patient so that standard parts can be
manufactured on a large scale, artificial dental crowns must be
configured to a shape conformal to the deficient site of an
individual patient and are thus required to be easily shaped by
the dentist or dental technician with simple means. It is,
however, difficult for the dentist or dental technician to
perform shaping by a casting process. The casting process
further has the problem that
