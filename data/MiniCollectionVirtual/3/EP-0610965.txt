<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink jet recording
apparatus provided with an ink jet head for effecting
recording with flying ink droplets utilizing the
film boiling phenomenon of liquid.The present invention also relates to an ink
cartridge interchangeably provided for the ink jet
recording apparatus.In recent years, various ink jet recording
methods have been put into practical use because in
such recording methods, the creation of noise during
recording is negligibly small and in addition,
recording can be effected on plain paper.Among them, the ink jet recording method
described, for example, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. 54-51837 (the so-called bubble jet
recording method) is such that heat energy is caused
to act on ink and the ink subjected to the action of
this heat energy causes a sudden volume change (film
boiling phenomenon) resulting from a state change and
by this action force, the ink is discharged from a
discharge port at the end of a recording head unit, 
whereby flying ink droplets are formed and adhere to a
recording medium to thereby accomplish recording.The principle of ink droplet formation in
such a recording method is that when an electro-thermal
converting member is electrically energized, the ink
in the heat-acting portion subjected to the action of
the heat energy which is ink droplet forming energy
causes a state change resulting from a sudden
increase in volume, that is, the ink in the heat-acting
portion causes the creation, growth and
contraction of a bubble very momentarily, whereby
the liquid present between the heat-acting portion and
the discharge opening is discharged as an ink droplet.By repeating such cycle of creation, growth,
contraction and disappearance of the bubble, the ink
is subjected to high heat. Therefore, thermally
unstable ink is liable to cause a chemical change and
in the heat-acting portion, production and precipitation
of insoluble matters may occur and further,
the recording head may become incapable of discharging
the ink. Accordingly, to effect recording
at a high speed for a long time by the use of such an
apparatus, it is very important to improve the
stability of the ink and on the other hand, to set
the optimum driving conditions corresponding to the
ink in the recording head.Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings shows 
variations with time in the surface temperature T of
the heat-acting surface when an electrical signal
of pulse waveform shown by P is input to a recording
head having an electro-thermal converting member and
the
