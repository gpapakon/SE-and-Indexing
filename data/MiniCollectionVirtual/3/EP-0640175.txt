<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine in which each cylinder is connected to sources both of air and of fuel held as a gas under pressure and in which the compression stroke, during which a full charge of air is drawn and compressed, is substantially completed before the fuel charge is then admitted and the mixture ignited to start the subsequent power stroke. The fuel may be admitted through a unit doubling as admission valve and igniter, and conventional diesel or gasoline-fuelled engines may be converted by designing that unit to fit into the conventional injector or spark plug holes. The compressed gaseous fuel may be methane, or other natural gas. The invention includes both stationary and mobile engines, especially automobile engines, and methods of operating them.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to internal combustion engines of the 
kind which use, as their source of power, a gaseous fuel stored 
as a gas. Many such engines have been proposed and used, in both 
automobile and stationary applications. It has however been 
common practice in such applications to prepare the charge of air 
and fuel gas, necessary for each power stroke of the combustion 
cycle, by mixing the two gaseous constituents in controllable 
proportions in a manifold upstream of the cylinder, in a manner 
and at pressures analogous to those in which air and vapourised 
fuel are premixed in a conventional gasoline-fuelled internal 
combustion engine. The gas fraction of the mixture thus 
displaces the equi ent volume of air, so preventing the engine 
from developing the best power or, if desired, fuel economy. 
Also, because the fuel gas must be stored at considerable 
pressure, typically of the order of 250 bar in order to maximise 
the time interval between refuellings, means must be provided 
between the tank and the manifold to reduce the pressure of the 
gas considerably, say to about 70 bar. The present invention arises from appreciating a number of 
potential advantages applicable to that use of pre-compressed 
gas, particularly compressed natural gas (CNG) as a fuel. 
Amongst these are firstly admitting the gaseous fuel directly to 
the cylinder of an internal combustion engine by way of a high 
pressure line and a variable orifice valve located substantially 
at the point of entry into the cylinder. Secondly, designing 
that valve in such a way that it may fit conveniently either into 
the spark plug hole of a conventional petrol-driven engine or the 
injector hole of a conventional diesel engine, so facilitating 
the conversion of either type of engine to operating on fuel 
stored as compressed gas. Thirdly the possibility of combining, 
within the admission valve unit, the means to generate a spark 
and ignite the fuel/air mixture within the cylinder at the start 
of the power stroke of the combustion cycle, closely following  
 
the admission of the gas fuel at the end of the compression stroke once the air has been 
raised to substantially its maximum pressure. Where CNG is used for fuel, such late 
admission and ignition is necessary because of the high octane rating of the fuel, and the 
incorporation of the spark-generating means within the valve unit clearly facilitates the 
conversion of conventional liquid-fuel internal combustion engines, especially those of 
diesel type where no

An internal combustion engine including at least one piston-and-cylinder 
combination, (59, 56) in which such a cylinder is connected in use both to a source of air 

(via 17) and to a source of fuel (1, via 7) held as a gas under pressure, in which the engine 
operates a combustion cycle including a compression stroke in which the cylinder draws 

a full charge of air and compresses it, and in which the compression stroke is then 
substantially completed before pressurised gaseous fuel is admitted to the cylinder from the 

fuel source through an injector unit (14), and the resulting air/fuel mixture is subsequently 
ignited by an igniter (51, 38) to initiate a power stroke, characterised in that substantially
