<ABSTRACT>
This conduit is of the type made of synthetic material and includes, projecting from its internal face, bearing surfaces capable of coming into contact with the conductors or fibre bundles. According to the invention, the contact bearing surfaces are constituted by pads (9) spaced transversely in rows (3a), these rows themselves being spaced longitudinally from adjacent rows, the transverse spacings (6) between pads (9) being angularly offset in order not to coincide with the spacings between pads of the adjacent rows.

Conduit with reduced friction for protecting 
buried conductors of the type which is made of synthetic 

material and includes, projecting from its internal face, 
surfaces which are able to come into contact with the 

conductors or bundles of fibres, characterized in that 
the contact surfaces consist of pads (9) spaced 

transversely in rows (3a), themselves spaced longitudinally 
from the nearby rows, the transverse gaps (6) 

between pads (9) being offset angularly so that they do 
not coincide with the gaps between pads of the nearby 

rows. 
Conduit according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the rows (3a) of pads are circular. 
Conduit according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the rows (3a) of pads are in the form of a spiral. 
Conduit according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the pads (9) are distributed in 

groups on the one length (L) of conduit and two successive 
lengths are joined together by a circular rib (8) 

with a V-shaped cross section projecting on the outside 
of the conduit and constituting a hinge about which the 

conduit can curve. 
Conduit according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that each pad (9) has a rounded top.
