<ABSTRACT>
A counter and/or divider arrangement having at least two part-counter circuits, each of which comprising a total number of flip flops arranged in a cascade circuit with respect to their data inputs and outputs, all part-counter circuits being supplied with a common clock signal, and having at least one logic element, provides for a representation of arbitrary counting processes or divider ratios with little circuit complexity and with an operation which has few switching disturbances, due to the fact that in each logic element, signals from the data output of in each case one of the flip flops of at least some of the part-counter circuits are combined to form an associated resultant signal in accordance with an AND function and each of the resultant signals is supplied to at least one of the part-counter circuits as reset signal for switching the part-counter circuit into a basic state, an output signal being formed from at least one of the resultant signals, the product of the total number of flip flops of all part-counter circuits being selected to be greater than or equal to a predetermined counting maximum or divider ratio and the total numbers being determined in such a manner that they do not have any common prime numbers, and the data outputs of the flips flops of the part-counter circuits, which are connected to the logic elements, being selected in such a manner that the output signal exhibits the predetermined counting maximum or divider ratio.
