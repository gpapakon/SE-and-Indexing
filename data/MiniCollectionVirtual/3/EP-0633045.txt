<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of carriers (17a to 17d) are towed by a 
traction car (14) moving along a guide portion (18) 

provided under a travel road surface plate (13) through 
flexible pulling members (16a to 16d). Mobile models 

(12a to 12d) on the travel road surface plate (13) are 
attracted to the towed carriers (17a to 17d) by magnets. 

Hence, the mobile models (12a to 12d) on the travel road 
surface plate (13) travel in accordance with the movement 

of the traction car (14). Furthermore, when a plurality 
of winch units (15a to 15d) provided to the traction car 

(14) are separately operated to take up and rewind the 
pulling members (16a to 16d), the plurality of mobile 

models (12a to 12d) travel at different speeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a racing game apparatus in
which a plurality of mobile bodies compete on a race course of
a running surface plate, comprising: a trolley moving along or
parallel to the running service plate, a plurality of carriers
guiding said mobile bodies on the race course by attracting
them by magnetic force.The racing game apparatus in which a plurality of mobile models
(horses, vehicles, and the like) are caused to travel on an
angular race course of a running surface to compete for a fast
arrival is popular. An example of a racing game apparatus of
this type includes a derby game, a car race, a boat race, and
the like.A racing game apparatus of the above mentioned type is
disclosed in US-A-3,326,555 wherein the trolley is embodied by
a rotor member having a plurality of arms at the distal end of
the rotor. The plurality of arms, each carrying permanent
magnets at their end, are rotatably mounted on a belt which is
turned around two pulleys. Each of the magnets attracts one
mobile body on the other side of the running surface.Due to the kinematic of the arms, the carriers guiding the
movement of the mobile bodies travel parallel along the path
determined by the belt around the pulleys. This has the
disadvantage that the racing game lacks reality. For example,
two mobile bodies which are guided by the same arm always have
the same distance to each other so that they cannot really
compete with each other.It is the object of the present invention to provide an
improved racing game apparatus of the above mentioned type
which has a simple structure and enables a more realistic
racing game situation. This object is solved with the racing game apparatus of the
above mentioned type, characterized in that the apparatus
comprises a plurality of a flexible string members for
connecting said trolley with said plurality of carriers. A racing game
apparatus according to one aspect of the present
invention comprises a permeable running surface
plate, a guide portion provided under the running
surface plate along a travel road, a traction car or trolley which
moves along the guide portion under the running
surface plate, a plurality of carriers which are towed by
the traction car and attract the mobile models on the
running surface plate by magnets, and a plurality of
flexible pulling members for connecting the traction car
with the plurality of carriers, wherein the traction car
is provided with a plurality of winch units for taking up
and rewinding the pulling members.According to the racing
