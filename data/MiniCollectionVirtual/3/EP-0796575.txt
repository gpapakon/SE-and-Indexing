The trolley carries equipment at three levels (11-13), the upper level (11) featuring strip lighting (14) and a hinged cover (8) which when opened out forms a working surface (6) for e.g. a notebook computer (31). Telefax equipment (33) can be installed in the upper space behind the computer. At the middle level (12) a safety belt (41) may be used to secure the trolley to the seat. The lower level (13) houses an electric battery (9).
