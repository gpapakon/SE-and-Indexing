<ABSTRACT>
Vibration-free double glazing mounted in a frame, of the type including at least two panes 1, 2 separated by a space 3, characterised in that at least part 16 of one wall delimiting this space 3 can move and is connected to driving means 10 to 15 controlled by an automatic-control system receiving at its input a signal representing the pressure in the said space 3 or the displacements of one of the said panes 1, 2, the said automatic-control system being arranged to control the displacements of the said movable part 16 so that they tend to keep the pressure in the said space 3 constant. Application to railway carriages.

Vibration absorbing double glazing mounted in a frame 
(4), of the type comprising at least two panes (1, 2) 

separated by a space (3), characterised in that at least one 
portion (16) of a partition defining this space (3) is 

mobile, and is connected to propulsive means (10 to 15) 
controlled by a servo system receiving at its input a signal 

representing the pressure in said space (3), or 
displacements of one of the said panes (1, 2), said servo 

system being set up to control displacements of said mobile 
portion (16) such that they tend to keep constant the 

pressure in said space (3). 
Double glazing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said mobile partition portion is constituted by a 

flexible or rigid membrane (16) which at the same time 
ensures the seal between the said space (3) and the said 

propulsive means (10 to 15).  
 
Double glazing according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that said propulsive means (10 to 15) comprise at least 

one linear electric motor of the variable-reluctance type 
with a double magnetic circuit (10, 11, 12, 13). 
Double glazing according to claim 3, characterised in 
that one or a plurality of elastic masses (17 to 19) of 

specific rigidity are interposed between mobile portions (14 
to 16) and fixed portions (9). 
double glazing according to claim 4, characterised in 
that one at least of these elastic masses is constituted by 

a ring (17) of elastomeric material or the like, interposed 
between a fixed portion (9) and the periphery of a rigid 

membrane (16) constituting said mobile portion of the 
partition. 
Double glazing according to claim 4, characterised in 
that at least one of these elastic masses (18) is 

constituted by a ring of elastomeric material or the like, 
interposed between a fixed portion (9) and the periphery of  

 
a laminated plate of magnetic material (14) of the motor, 

interposed between its two magnetic circuits (10 to 13). 
Double glazing according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said input of the servo system 

is connected to an internal or external pressure sensor 
(25), or to a movement sensor or accelerometer connected to 

the pane emitting the vibrations. 
Double glazing according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said propulsive means and said 

mobile portion (16) of the partition form part of a casing 
(9) capable of being secured in a housing (7) of said frame 

(4).
