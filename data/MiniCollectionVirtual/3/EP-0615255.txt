<ABSTRACT>
A fuel rod position determination apparatus and a method are 
presented to enable efficient and accurate determination of the 

positions of the fuel rods in a fuel assembly in which it is not 
possible to insert a measuring instrument in a straight line through 

the fuel assembly. The apparatus first measures the positions of 
the peripheral fuel rods from the outside of the fuel assembly. 

This operation is continued by inserting sensors (30) into the 
assembly through the spaces between the fuel rods (5) so as to 

measure the profiles of the fuel rods. The positions of all the 
fuel rods including the interior fuel rods are determined on the 

basis of the profile data, the reference data formed by the periph- 
eral fuel rods and the known diameter data of the fuel rods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of measuring the 
positions of a plurality of fuel rods spaced apart from each other 
in a fuel assembly, and an apparatus for performing such measurements. A conventional type of fuel assembly such as the one shown in 
Figure 11 comprises: an upper nozzle 1; a lower nozzle 2 which is 
oppositely spaced apart from the upper nozzle 1; a plurality of 
support grids 3, having grid cells formed by straps, disposed at a 
predetermined interval between the upper nozzle 1 and the lower 
nozzle 2; control rod guide pipes 4 which are inserted through the 
grid cells and attached to the support grids 3, to the upper nozzle 
1 and to the lower nozzle 2; and a plurality of fuel rods 5 which 
are inserted into the grid cells of the support grids 3, and elastically 
held by the springs formed inside the support grids 3. The 
spacing between the fuel rods 5 in this type of fuel assembly is 
measured by inserting a strain gauge type probe between the fuel rods 
5, and the contact force on the probe is taken as a measure of the 
spacing. In the conventional type of fuel assembly shown in Figure 11, 
the size of the opening of the grid cells for inserting the fuel 
rods 5 is the same as that for inserting the guide pipes 4, thus  
 
making it possible to use the technique of inserting the probe 
between the fuel rods 5 to measure their spacing. However, in the 
other type of fuel assembly shown in Figure 2, in which large guide 
pipes 10 occupy the space equivalent to four fuel rods, there are 
regions of the fuel rods where the strain gauge type probe becomes 
impossible to be inserted because of the interference presented by 
the guide pipes 10. EP-A-0,053,066 discloses a method and apparatus for determining the 
dimensions of fuel rods in a reactor using a light emitting probe and a 
corresponding light receiving probe. The probes are adjustably positioned 
on opposite sides of the rods and the light beam is used to provide data 
that is subsequently evaluated to determine the dimensions of the rods. However, it is believed that the apparatus of EP-A-0,053,066 would not 
work successfully in fuel assemblies in which the guide pipes are of larger 
dimensions than the fuel rods. The present invention presents a method and an apparatus 
for efficiently and accurately determining the positions of the fuel 
rods in a fuel assembly having such a structure that a conventional 
strain gauge type of instrument cannot be used. Broad aspects of a method
