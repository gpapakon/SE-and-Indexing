<ABSTRACT>
Anchor particularly for curtain walls comprising a 
fixing element (1) provided with a fixing wing (2), a 

horizontal wing (3) and a vertical wing (4) which are 
arranged on planes which are substantially perpendicular to 

each other. A slider (20) for supporting the adjustment 
screw is associated with the vertical wing (4), which lies 

substantially at right angles to the fixing wing (2) and 
ends with an element (31) for engaging a panel and the like. 

There are also slider positioning means (25,26) supported by 
the horizontal wing (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anchor particularly
for curtain walls.As is known, anchors for curtain walls are already
commercially available; they include an element for fixing
them to the vertical wall of the building and an out-of-plumb
adjustment screw which is connected to said element
and lies substantially at right angles to the wall of the
building.From DE-A-89 06 426.7 it is known an anchor for curtain
walls, comprising a fixing element, a spacer and a holding
element; the spacer is vertically movable with respect to
the fixing element and the holding element is fixed so as to
be horizontally movable with respect to the spacer.From FR-A-2 668 523 it is known an anchor for curtain
walls comrising a fixing element connectable to a wall, a
slider for supporting an adjustment screw and ending with an
adjustable element for engaging a plate and means for
vertically positioning the slider with respect to the fixing
element.With these anchors, adjustment must be possible on a
vertical plane and along a horizontal line, in order to be
able to correct any misalignments of the bore line with
respect to the edge of the panel to be fixed; the adjustment
screw that connects the panel to the anchor must furthermore
allow adjustment so as to correct the so-called out-of-plumb
of the wall of the building. Currently used solutions adjust the vertical position
by inserting, at the wall fixing screw, wedge-shaped
elements or cams that allow correct positioning in terms of
elevation; however, in all these solutions it is necessary
to loosen the wall fixing screw to achieve correct
positioning and then tighten said fixing screw again: this
method leads to drawbacks, since it is possible to
inadvertently forget to tighten the screw; the coupling of
the screw in the wall may also become unstable.Another drawback that can be ascribed to the solutions
of the prior art is constituted by the fact that in order to
set the adjustment screw to provide a correct plumb
arrangement it is necessary to disengage the coupling
element of the adjustment screw from the panel, perform the
various adjustments by trial and error, and then re-engage
the coupling element.Prior art document EP-A-0 212 228 discloses an anchor
provided with a horizontal adjustment screw with a captured
threaded nut which enables the horizontal adjustment of the
panel to take place even once the panel has been mounted.From GB-A-2 155 072 it is known a device as defined in
the preamble of claim 1.It is evident that all the solutions according to the
prio

<CLAIMS>
An anchor particularly for curtain walls, comprising
a fixing element (100) which has a vertical fixing plate

(101) and a horizontal wing (102), a slider (120) for
supporting an adjustment screw (130) being slidably

connected to said vertical fixing plate (101), said slider
(120) lying substantially at right angles to said vertical

fixing plate (101) and the outer end ending with an element
(135) for engaging a plate and the like, means (125,126)

being furthermore provided for positioning said slider
(120), said positioning means (125,126) being supported by

said horizontal wing (102), characterized in that said
slider (120) is constituted by a U-shaped plate (121) which

has, at one (122) of its two arms, two tabs (123) that
laterally engage said fixing plate (101) to act as a guiding

element, said U-shaped plate (121) supporting said
adjustment screw (130) with its outer arm (131) and with an

intermediate tab (132). 
The anchor of claim 1, characterized in that said
horizontal wing (102) is formed by blanking a portion of

said vertical fixing plate (101).
The anchor of one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said horizontal wing (102) is formed

at a countersunk rim (103) adapted to act as a reinforcement
element.
The anchor of one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said means for positioning said slider

are constituted by a bolt (125) that rotatably engages a
threaded seat (126) formed on said horizontal wing (102) and

rotatably engages a contoured slot (128) formed by said U-shaped 
plate (121).
The anchor of claim 1, characterized in that said
slider (120) abuts against said fixing plate (101).
The anchor of one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it comprises a reinforcement wing

(141) which is formed by blanking in said vertical fixing
plate (101) and is associated with said horizontal wing

(102) by interposing a tubular spacer (143) that forms the
seat for the passage of said bolt (125).
