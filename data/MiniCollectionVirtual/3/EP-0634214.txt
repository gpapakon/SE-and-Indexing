<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to shell-shaped Pd/K/Au, Pd/K/Ba and Pd/K/Cd supported catalysts, production thereof and use thereof for the preparation of vinyl acetate from ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen in the gas phase. The said catalysts are produced by spraying the support particles, under conditions of intimate mixture, with a solution of salts of the corresponding elements in the form of droplets of a mean diameter of at least 0.3 mm or in the form of liquid jets and then immediately drying them, the dynamic viscosity of the solution being at least 0.003 Pa.s and the solution volume during spraying being 5 to 80% of the pore volume of the support particles.
