<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressure
vessel for holding a cartridge, loose media, and the
like for conditioning and/or purifying fluid, and
particularly concerns a pressure vessel which
includes a cover and a bowl, and a flexible shear
rod for securing the cover to the bowl. The
invention also relates to a manifold mounted and
sealed to the cover via an O-ring groove assembly,
ultrasonic insertion, and/or a silicone sealant
disposed between the manifold and the cover.A pressure vessel for holding a cartridge
filter and the like for conditioning and/or
purifying fluid typically comprises a cover, a bowl,
an O-ring seal, and a v-clamp to hold the cover to
the bowl and to compress the O-ring seal. Closing a pressure vessel using a V-clamp requires carefully
aligning the cover and the bowl while at the same time manipulating the
V-clamp. This is a fairly cumbersome task, and a very difficult task for a
person with arthritic hands or for a person working on a pressure vessel
that is positioned in a constrained area.US 5035798 discloses a water filtration device having a vessel as
defined in the precharacterising clause of Claim 1. In the vessel of US
5035798 the cover is not detachably connected to the bowl.It is an object of the invention to provide a pressure vessel that does
not require a V-clamp to close it.It is another object to provide a pressure vessel that is easy to
close.These and other objects are accomplished by providing a pressure
vessel in accordance with Claim 1 of the appended claims. The pressure
vessel comprises a cover having a top wall and a side wall extending
downwardly therefrom, the side wall having an inner surface, a bowl
positioned below the cover and having a bottom wall and a side wall
extending upwardly therefrom, the side wall having an outer surface,
sealing means positioned between the cover and the bowl for sealing the
cover to the bowl, and securing means for securing the cover of the bowl. The securing means includes a track comprising
a first groove formed in the inner surface of the
cover and a second groove formed in the outer
surface of the bowl and aligned with the first
groove. An opening is formed in the cover for
providing an entrance to the track, and a flexible
shear rod is received in the track for blocking the
cover from sliding off the bowl.A manifold is mounted to the top wall of the
cover, the manifold having an inlet tube and an
outlet tube that protrude from a first hole and a
second hole formed in the top wall of the cover.Fig. 1 is a view in cross
