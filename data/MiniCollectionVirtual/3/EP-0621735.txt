<ABSTRACT>
In the method for setting up a device having a number of signalling and/or control units, a central station in each case indicates the function corresponding to the unit to be addressed or connecting terminals to be allocated. If this unit is then operated, for example by pressing a key, the address predetermined by the central station is then stored in this unit. The complicated setting of addresses during the setting up of the device is therefore not required. In the case of indicating lamps which are operated via electronics, the electronics can be arranged in the lamp holder. In the device, lamps can be used which signal a switching state contactlessly with the aid of a reflective light beam.
