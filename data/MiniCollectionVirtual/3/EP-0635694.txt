<CLAIMS>
Device for cooling a gas that forms deposits comprising an upright 
container (1) through which the gas flows , at least two heating surface 

units (3, 9; 9, 13) being arranged in the container and being comprised of 
at least one heating surface of closed geometry, a cooling medium flowing 

through said at least two heating surface units, and a plurality of beating 
devices (7, 11, 14) associated to the individual heating surfaces for the 

mechanical cleaning of the heating surfaces,
 
characterized in that the upper (3; 9) of the heating surface units (3, 9; 9, 

13) is supported (2) by the container (1) and the lower heating surface (9; 
13) is connected to the upper heating surface unit (3; 19) by connecting 

tubes (8; 12) conveying a cooling medium in such a manner that the 
cooling medium flows sequentially through the heating surface units (6; 

10; 13') and the connecting tubes (8; 12) form between the heating 
surfaces an open geometry which does not impair the beating effect (7; 11; 

14) on the individual heating surface units. 
Device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that each heating surface unit (3; 9; 13) comprises a 

plurality of heating surfaces (3a-3b; 9a-9d; 13a-13c) being arranged in a 
nested configuration in a bundle-like manner, each of the heating surfaces 

projecting from a neighboring one of the heating surfaces and in the 
beating devices (7a-7d; 11a-11d; 14a-14c) being able to act independently 

on the heating surfaces (3a-3d; 9a-9d; 13a-13c). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the height of said heating surface bundle and the 

heating surfaces, respectively, in the direction of flow of the gas is 
adjusted to the cleaning effect determined by the acceleration exerted by 

the beating devices.  
 
Device according to at least one of the claims 1 - 3,
 
characterized in that the connecting tubes (8; 12) extend substantially 

vertically and straight in direction of the gas flow (G). 
Device according to at least one of the claims 1 - 4,
 
characterized in that starting from the area of the connecting tubes the 

free cross-section of the gas (G) is delimited (1a) in such a manner that 
the velocity is increased in the following heating surface unit (13). 
Device according to at least one of the claims 1 - 5,
 
characterized in that the contruction of the individual heating surfaces (3; 

9; 13) in a closed geometry is achievable by the use of tube-stay-tube 
construction or by using fin-tube contruction. 
Device according to at least one of the claims 1 - 6,
 
characterized in that an outer wall cooling surface and/or an inner wall 

cooling surface delimiting the gas flow to an annular flow chamber are 
provided, which are also supplied by cooling medium.
