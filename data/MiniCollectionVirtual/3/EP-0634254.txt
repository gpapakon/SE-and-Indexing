A device for producing wood products from trunk 
timber, comprising feed means for accommodating a tree trunk, 

which means may be moved, together with the tree trunk, along 
a feed path extending substantially in the longitudinal 

direction of the tree trunk, said feed path including a 
working section with a series of tools arranged thereon, 

which may be brought into working engagement with a tree 
trunk moved along the working section, characterised in that 

the feed means may be moved backwards and forwards along the 
generally linear, restricted feed path and in that the tools 

are carried individually or - for engagement of like tools in 
the tree trunk from both sides - optionally also in pairs of 

working units arranged along the working section, which 
working units may be conveyed perpendicularly to the feed 

path between a working position on the working section and a 
rest position a distance from the working section for the 

purpose of selective use. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the feed means for accommodating a tree trunk are provided 

with a chucking device which leaves the chucked tree trunk 
free at one of its longitudinal sides for the purpose of 

working engagement of the tools, and in that the tools are 
arranged exclusively on one side of the working section and 

may be brought from this side into engagement with the free 
side of the tree trunk. 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the feed path is a rail section and the 

feed means is constructed as a rail-borne truck.  
 
A device according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterised in that the chucking device is displaceable, 

especially controlledly, on the conveying means 
perpendicularly to the feed path. 
A device according to at least one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that a feeder truck with the features of at 

least one of claims 11 to 13 is provided as the feed means. 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the chucking means are constructed as jaw-type gripper pairs 

which may be brought into engagement with a tree trunk from 
above and below on the opposite side of the working section 

from the tools. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the drive units are each provided with 

a specific tool type. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the drive units are of modular 

construction with respect to their base and may be installed 
in various positions along the working section. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that a series of at least three working 

units is provided with various types of tool, the first drive 
unit of which, when viewed in the feed direction of the feed 

means, is provided with one or two chippers for flattening a 
tree trunk side, the second drive unit is provided with 

angular cutters for cutting out angles at the tree edges and 
the third drive unit is provided with at least one pair of 

saw blades for separating one or more boards defined by cut 
out angles. 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that a drive-free working unit is provided  

 
in at least one position on the working section and comprises 

a cutter for creating thin boards by cutting. 
A feeder truck, especially for rail-borne, linear 
displaceability, for use for feeding a tree trunk to be 

processed in the longitudinal direction thereof in a trunk 
timber processing plant, said feeder truck comprising a 

chucking device for a tree trunk, which comprises at least 
two spaced chucking means, at least one of the chucking means 

and/or the entire chucking device being adjustable in a 
horizontal plane in such a way that the axis of a chucked 

tree trunk is oriented in a horizontal plane with respect to 
the feed direction of the truck, characterised in that at 

least one of the chucking means and/or the entire chucking 
device is additionally vertically adjustable in such a way 

that the axis of a chucked tree trunk is of adjustable 
inclination in a vertical plane. 
A feeder truck according to claim 11, characterised 
in that the chucking means are arranged on a common base 

frame, which is mounted on the truck so as to be tiltable 
about a horizontal swivel axis extending perpendicularly to 

the feed direction of the truck. 
A feeder truck according to claim 11 or claim 12, 
characterised in that actuators, whose positions may be 

controlled, are provided on the truck for the purpose of the 
adjustability of the chucking means and/or the chucking 

device. 
A method for producing wood products from trunk 

timer, in which one or more sides of a tree trunk are 
flattened, angles at the edges of the tree are optionally 

formed to be parallel to one of these flattened faces and 
then at least one wood product is separated, likewise 

parallel to this flattened face, characterised in that the 
tree trunk is flattened at one side to be parallel with the  

 
surface lines and further working, i.e. optionally forming of 

angles at the edges of the tree and the separation of wood 
products parallel with this flattened face parallel with the 

surface lines, is effected exclusively on one side of the 
tree trunk starting at this flat face, and, when a certain 

number of wood products have been separated, this process is 
repeated starting from another side of the tree trunk, 

preferably from the opposite side thereof from the former 
side.
