<ABSTRACT>
Method and system for selectively retrieving information contained in a 
stored document set using a non-literal, or "fuzzy", search strategy. A text string 

query is transmitted (200) to a computer processor, and a dissimilarity value D
i
 is 
assigned (208) to selected ones of stored text strings representative of information 

contained in a stored document set. A set of retrieved text strings representative 
of stored information and related to the text string query is generated (212). Each 

of the retrieved text strings has an associated dissimilarity value D
i
, which is a 
function of at least one rule R
n
 used to retrieve the text string and a weight value 
w
n
 associated with that rule R
n
. The retrieved text strings are displayed (216) in 
an order based on their associated dissimilarity value D
i
. Once one or more of 
the retrieved text strings is selected, the weight value w
n
 associated with each 
rule R
n
 of the first set of rules is adjusted (220) and stored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of document storage
and retrieval systems of the type used for multiple document manipulation.
Specifically, the invention relates to a method and system for selectively
searching and retrieving information from stored documents using a non-literal
search strategy.Electronic storage of documents has facilitated the handling of large
volumes of documents, such as those handled by hospitals, universities,
government institutions, and the like. Typically, the documents are entered into
massive storage systems by use of a scanner system that converts text into
electronic data. Documents primarily containing text can readily be scanned and
stored in various electronic forms in this manner. Selective retrieval of
information from the stored document set poses significant problems due to the
volume of information to be searched.Typical existing systems assign an index to each document as it is entered
into storage. The index may be a system-generated or a user-defined code
associated with each document. The code then is stored together with the
document. To retrieve a document, a user must enter the appropriate code
associated with the desired document. Other systems use key words extracted 
from the document which the user may then use to retrieve a document. The
problem encountered with such systems is that a user may retrieve only entire
documents, and must know the index, code, or key words associated with a
desired document.Other systems permit users to access selected information from a
document set by entering a search term into the system. The system then reads
through the entire document set to find an exact match for the entered search
term. However, in some instances there may be a mismatch between the search
term and the term in the document set. For example, a user may enter a wrong
or unintended search term, such as by making a keyboarding or other error when
entering the search term. As another example, there may be an error in the
original text, OCR, or manually entered key word. Existing systems that search
for exact matches are incapable of handling such errors in entering search
terms, and would be unable to retrieve a desired document.A non-literal, or "fuzzy", search involves entering a text string into a
computer system and then searching for a "close" match of that text string in a
stored text file. For example, a user may request a search on "recieve" (spelled
incorrectly), and the system may find the correctly spelled word "receive".
