<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
suppressing a pinking phenomenon affecting the operation 
of an internal combustion engine and, more particularly, 
to such a method calling on a "fuzzy" logic control of an 
engine operation parameter. It is known that certain abnormal combustions of 
the air/fuel mixture introduced into an internal combustion 
engine give rise to high-pressure waves and hence to 
an acoustic noise known as "pinking". When the latter is 
intense, it may result in impairments of the engine, such 
as erosion of the cylinder head and pistons, fractures of 
the piston lands and rings, failure of the cylinder head 
gasket or deterioration of the valves, for example. As known for example from the publication 
"Adaptive Spark Control with Knock Detection" published 
by the Society of Automotive Engineers under the number 
840447, the operating diagram of a conventional device 
designed to prevent such deteriorations of the engine 
under the effect of the pinking phenomenon has been 
represented in Fig. 1 of the attached drawing. The device 
comprises a pinking sensor 1, of the accelerometer type 
for example, fixed to the engine so as to be sensitive to 
the pinking arising in each cylinder of the engine, the 
sensor delivering a signal processed in a conditioning 
stage 2 before being delivered to means 3 for calculating 
an ignition advance reduction RA, as a function of various 
strategies, these means correcting, as a function of 
the calculated reduction, the instant of ignition of the 
engine spark plugs located in the cylinders in which the 
pinking was detected. It is known that such a reduction 
has the effect of suppressing the pinking. When the 
latter has disappeared, the calculating means permit a 
return of the ignition advance to the nominal value. More precisely, in accordance with a current 
technique used for detecting pinking, during each engine  
 
cycle, the average energy of the pinking, in each of the 
cylinders in which it occurs, is calculated and this 
average energy (clqmoy) is compared with the 
instantaneous pinking energy (valclq) as illustrated by 
the graph of Fig. 2. A band separating a region situated 
to its right and in which pinking is supposed to exist 
from a region situated to its left in which pinking is 
supposed not to exist, has been represented in this 
graph. The separation band has a slope (clqgn) and an 
origin abscissa (clqof) for its right boundary. Hence, pinking is supposed to be present if: 
clqmoy < (valclq - clqof) Ã— clqgn In

<CLAIMS>
Method of suppressing a pinking phenomenon affecting 
the operation of an internal combustion engine, by 

correcting at least one of the quantities from the group 
formed by the ignition advance angle of an air/fuel 

mixture introduced into the engine, the composition of 
this mixture and the energy of the ignition spark, a 

method according to which the instantaneous energy of the 
pinking phenomenon is measured and a quantity (R
i
) dependent 
on the instantaneous value of this measurement is 

calculated, characterised in that a sliding average value 
(R
m
) of the quantity (R
i
) is calculated, weighted by a 
forget factor and a correction (R
A
) to be applied is 
calculated from predetermined relations gleaned from a 

set of such relations and selected as a function of the 
instantaneous values of the quantity (R
i
) and of its 
weighted sliding average (R
m
). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the quantity (R
i
) is calculated from the expression: 

R
i
 = 
valclq - K
1
clqmoy
 x K
2
 
where (valclq) is the instantaneous value of the measurement 

of the energy of the pinking phenomenon, (clqmoy) is 
a sliding average value of this measurement, K
1
 and K
2
 are 
constants. 
Method according to either of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the quantity (R
i
) is sampled and a 
weighted sliding average (R
m
) of the quantity (R
i
) is 
calculated such that: 


 
is the sum of the N latest samples acquired, each 

weighted by a forget factor (N-j+i)
-1
.  
 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the quantity (R
i
) and its average 
value (R
m
) are converted into "fuzzy" variables and the 
correction (R
A
) is gleaned from an inference engine 
supplied with (R
i
) and (R
m
). 
Method according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the inference engine is defined by the table: 


 
and by predetermined membership functions of the fuzzy 

variables (R
i
) and (R
m
) to membership classes (TF to G) 
and (ZE to TG) respectively, the instantaneous values of 

the fuzzy variables (R
i
) and (R
m
) determining the rules 
of this table which condition the thereby deduced fuzzy 

correction (R
a
) to one or more membership classes (ZE to 
TG). 
Method according to Claim 5, in accordance with 
which the correction (R
A
) is a correction of the ignition 
advance angle, characterised in that a numerical value of 

the ignition advance correction is gleaned from the value 
of the fuzzy quantity (R
A
) by aggregating the membership 
classes of the fuzzy quantity (R
A
).
