<ABSTRACT>
For fastening a safety belt (6) within a motor vehicle, provision is made for the safety belt (6) together with the components associated with it, such as an automatic belt retracting device (5), a vertical belt adjustment device (7) or the like, to be fastened, in the form of a structural unit which is premounted on a supporting part (17), in the interior of the body (1), for example on a central column (3). As a result, the manufacturing outlay and assembly time can be substantially reduced.
