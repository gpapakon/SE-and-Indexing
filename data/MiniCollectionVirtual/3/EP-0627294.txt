<ABSTRACT>
An illustrative embodiment of the present invention seeks 
to provide an injection compression molding method that can 

produce large molded products having superior external appearance 
with functional resin, and an injection molding machine 

suitable for implementing said injection compression molding 
method. 
The illustrative injection compression molding method makes 
control of the linear velocity of the melted resin fluid front 

injected into the die cavity possible, regardless of whether the 
die is opened or is closed and the capacity has changed. An 

illustrative injection compression molding machine for implementing 
the injection compression molding method has die opening 

position detection part (13), screw position detection part 
(24), and control part (3), which executes control while maintaining 

the outputs from said detection parts in a prescribed 
relationship.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an injection compression 
molding method for obtaining synthetic resin molded products and 
an injection compression molding machine suitable for executing 
said method. Background to the present invention will now be explained 
with reference, by way of example, to Figures 3 and 4 of the 
accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 3 is an explanatory figure showing the relation to 
the resin flow velocity in the case of conventional compression 
molding. Figure 4 is an explanatory figure showing the relation to 
the resin flow velocity in the case of conventional injection 
molding. As is known, when molding a relatively large molded product 
with synthetic resin material, there is a tendency for cracks 
and warpage to be created when injection molding is executed. 
In order to avoid this situation, an injection compression 
molding method, which combines the injection molding method and 
compression molding method and utilizes the merits of both, is 
used. The characteristics of conventional compression molding 
method and conventional injection molding method will be 
explained with reference to Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the 
relationship between the flow velocity of the resin and the die 
position in the case of compression molding. As shown in the 
figure, when the resin quantity is fixed and the pressurization 
speed is also fixed, the flow velocity of the resin is low at 
first, then gradually becomes higher. The state of the flow 
velocity, in this case, becomes like the graph on the upper part 
of the figure. In contrast, as in Figure 4, which shows the relationship 
between the flow velocity of the resin and the screw position in 
the injection molding method, when the die position is fixed and 
the injection speed is also fixed, the initial flow velocity is  
 
high, then gradually becomes low. This means that the change 
is opposite that of compression molding. In an injection compression molding method, which combines 
said two molding methods, the change in the flow velocity of 
resin is complex, and control of the flow velocity corresponding 
to the resin type and product shape becomes important. In the injection compression molding method related to the 
conventional technology, generation of molding deformation, 
warpage, etc., are pointed out in comparison to the conventional 
injection molding method. In order to solve said disadvantage, 
countermeasures, such as improving the die clamping process, 
increasing the die temperature, etc., are used, and for
