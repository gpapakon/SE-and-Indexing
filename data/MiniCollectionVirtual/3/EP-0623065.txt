<ABSTRACT>
A profiled clamping jaw for a clamping device has a base body (12) and a clamping surface (14) arranged on the base body and adaptable to the surface profile of a workpiece (54). To make it possible to adapt by simple means the clamping surface (14) of the profiled clamping jaw (10) to the surface profile of the workpiece, the clamping surface (14) is composed of a plurality of pressure pieces (16) movable with respect to the base body (12) and capable of being locked thereon in a determined clamping position.

<CLAIMS>
A profiled clamping jaw for a clamping device 
comprising a base body (12) and a clamping surface (14) 

arranged on the base body, shapable by moving the base body 
(12) toward a workpiece (54) until a clamping position is 

reached, and thereby automatically adaptable to the contour 
of a workpiece surface, which clamping surface is composed 

of a plurality of thrust pieces, which are movable 
independently from one another relative to the base body and 

can be locked in a clamping position on said base body, with 
each thrust piece (16) being guided with a clamping ram (18) 

in a sliding guide (20) of the base body (12), the clamping 
rams (18) each carrying a ram piston (72) engaging a ram 

cylinder (74) of the base body (12), and the ram cylinders 
(74) being loadable through a common hydraulic distributor 

(76) in clamping direction with hydraulic fluid, 
characterized in that between the individual ram cylinders 

(74) and the hydraulic distributor (76) there is arranged 
each one check valve (70), and that the check valves (70) 

each carry one control piston (90) loadable on two sides 
with hydraulic fluid and arranged in a control cylinder 

(86), and that the control pistons (90) can be loaded 
together with hydraulic fluid on their piston surfaces, 

which are opposite to one another, through two separate 
hydraulic distributors (76, 88). 
The profiled clamping jaw according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the ram pistons (72) are loaded with 

atmospheric pressure preferably from the surrounding air at  
 

their piston surface opposite the hydraulic distributor 

(76). 
The profiled clamping jaw according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the ram pistons (72) and the piston 

surfaces of the control pistons (90), which piston surfaces 
are preferably on the side of the check valve, can be loaded 

with hydraulic fluid from the same hydraulic distributor 
(76). 
The profiled clamping jaw according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the ram cylinders (74) 

and control cylinders (86), which are associated with one 
another, are aligned axially parallel, preferably coaxially 

with one another. 
The profiled clamping jaw according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the hydrocylinders (74) 

are arranged in a common cylinder block (92). 
The profiled clamping jaw according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the check valves (70) are arranged in 

a common valve plate (98), which is connected, preferably 
screwed, to the cylinder block (92). 
The profiled clamping jaw according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the control cylinders (74) are 

arranged in one common cylinder plate (102) connected, 
preferably screwed, to the valve plate (98), and closed off 

on the side opposite the valve plate with a base plate 
(106).  

 
The profiled clamping jaw according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that between the valve plate (98) and the 

cylinder plate (102) there is arranged a free space forming 
the hydraulic distributor (76). 
The profiled clamping jaw according to Claim 7 or 8, 
characterized by a free space arranged between the valve 

plate (102) and the base plate (106) and forming a second 
hydraulic distributor (88) communicating with the control 

cylinders (86). 
The profiled clamping jaw according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized by a cover plate (94, 96) 

closing off the cylinder block on the side of the thrust 
piece and having openings (20) for passage of the clamping 

rams (18). 
The profiled clamping jaw according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that between the cover plate (94, 96) and 

the cylinder block (92) there is arranged a space (82) 
connected to the ram cylinders (74) on the side of the rod 

and preferably communicating with the atmosphere.
