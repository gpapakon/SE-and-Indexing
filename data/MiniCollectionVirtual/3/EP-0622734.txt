<ABSTRACT>
In an interface between a central control device and a peripheral device which is controlled by it, the two devices are connected to each other by two lines, of which the first is used to transmit signals from the control device to the peripheral device, and the second is used to transmit signals in the opposite direction. Signals are transmitted in both directions in a clocked and synchronised manner, and if the synchronisation fails, the peripheral device cannot be switched on.

<CLAIMS>
An interface between a central control device and a peripheral device 
controlled thereby, wherein the two devices are interconnected by two lines, 

the first of which is for transmitting signals from the control device to the 
peripheral device and the second is for transmitting signals in the reverse 

direction, characterised in that signal transmission in both directions is 
clocked and synchronised and in that the peripheral device contains a means 

which prevents the peripheral device being switched on in the absence of 
synchronisation between the central control device and the peripheral 

device. 
An interface according to claim 1, characterised in that by doubling 
the clock frequency on the first signal line, the peripheral device can be 

switched on or off in opposition to the reverse switching command at the 
original clock frequency. 
An interface according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in order 
to transmit a value item from the peripheral device to the control device, the 

clock pulses on the second line can be suitably modulated in width and/or 
amplitude. 
An interface according to claim 3, characterised in that in order to 
transmit a number of value items, the corresponding clock pulses can be 

transmitted by modulation in the time-multiplex process. 
An interface according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the peripheral device reports a fault to the control device by a preset 

sequence of voltage pulses. 
An interface according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the control device optically displays a fault in the peripheral device.
