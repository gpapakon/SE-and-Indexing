<ABSTRACT>
An automatic forming machine (10) for hot forging workpieces conveyed step by step through the forging area has a driven eccentric shaft (8) upon which is mounted a connecting rod (7) linked to an up-and-down movable tool carriage (6). By associating an irregular drive mechanism (19) with the eccentric shaft (8), the automatic forming machine (1) allows continuous operation even in the case of hot forging.

<CLAIMS>
Automatic forming machine, in particular eccentric or crank 
press, for hot forging workpieces which are conveyed stepwise 

through a forging region, having a driven eccentric shaft (8) on 
which there is mounted a connecting rod (6) [sic]
 connected to 
the tool carria
ge (6), which can be moved up and down, and with 
which eccentric shaft (8) there is associated an irregular drive 

(19) having a stationary, internally toothed hollow gear (23) 
meshing with a planet pinion gear (24), characterized in that the 

irregular drive (19) is constructed with a planet gear system 
(20) in which the planet pinion gear (24) is in geared connection 

by way of an intermediate gear (25) with a pinion (26) mounted 
on the eccentric shaft (8). 
Forming machine according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the speed of the eccentric shaft (8) is three times as high as 

the stroke rate of the tool carriage (6).
