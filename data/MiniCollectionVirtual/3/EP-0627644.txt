<ABSTRACT>
An image display device based on liquid crystal panels 
is arranged for outputting a high quality image, specifically 

one in which the problem of the shadow border between pixels 

has been remedied. Embodiments of the display device employ 
various techniques to address the problem. One solution, a 

multi-pixelating technique, surrounds pixels with virtual 
images of pixel, where both the spacing and the range of the 

multi-pixelating are precisely controllable. In other solution, 
the divergence of the light incident upon the liquid crystal 

panel is carefully controlled. or the light field emerging from 
the liquid crystal panel is modulated, in order to project a 

carefully controlled pixel image intensity distribution onto a 
diffusely scattering surface. The techniques developed are 

applicable to color liquid crystal panels as well, and can be 
employed to perform a precisely interpolated color mixing of 

neighboring pixels. Some of the embodiments employ a 
specially designed lighting unit for providing white parallel 

rays to the liquid crystal device. Because of advantages in 
areas of size, weight and image quality, the display device is 

particularly suitable to head mounted displays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image display device for outputting
a high-quality image. The device has a display unit, which may be a liquid
crystal display unit.Herein, three representative related arts to the present invention will be
described.A typical liquid crystal display unit provides a far lower image quality
if a user watches the display closely or magnifies the image with a lens. This
is because an opaque boundary exists between adjacent pixels so that these
pixels are seen as spatially separated luminous points. In particular, in the
case of a display unit for the color display, disadvantageously, the color dots
which constitute a single mixed color pixel are 
viewed as separate and distinct from each other. To cope with
this disadvantage, a technique has been proposed in Japanese
Lying Open No. 59-36282 or PCT/WO/92/16075.The first related art concerns the display unit
arranged according to the technique as shown in Fig.16. As
shown, the display unit is arranged to have a diffuse
backlighting unit 1201, a liquid crystal display 1202, and a
light scattering plate 1203. In operation, diffuse rays of
light emitted from the backlighting unit 1201 pass through the
liquid crystal display 1202 and reach the light scattering
plate 1203 where they are scattered. As a result, the image
1205 of a pixel 1204 is expanded on the light scattering plate
1203 so that the shadow region surrounding the pixel will be
filled in. Further, in the case of a color display unit, this
pixel expansion overlaps adjacent pixels of differing primary
colors resulting in a mixed-color image, improving image
quality.As mentioned above, the light scattering plate located
just before the display makes it possible to eliminate the
space between the pixels. The intensity distribution 1211 of
the magnified pixel image 1205 is formed to spread wide as
shown in Fig. 17, This brings about a disadvantageous side
effect, namely making the edges in the image vague. Because
edge detection is important for image comprehension, this
blurring of edges can lead directly to eye fatigue. The lack
of control mechanisms for setting the size, as well as other 
parameter values of the pixel's expanded image prevent the
remedying of these size effects.This description will now be oriented to the second
related art.Display units such as liquid crystal displays entail a
provision for blocking the transmission of light in the area
between adjacent pixels, these areas corresponding to electrode
wires. In the case where the image is magnified
