<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of polyimides or of their polypeptide hydrolysates with a biodegradability of at least 80%, by thermal polycondensation of at least one amino acid and then, optionally, hydrolysis, the thermal polycondensation stage being carried out in the presence of at least one "acid catalyst" chosen from   . sulphuric, nitric, phosphorous, sulphurous, hydrofluoric, silicic and sulfonic acids, organic sulfonic acids containing less than 50 carbon atoms, amino acids carrying a strong acid functional group which is not a carboxylic acid functional group, organic phosphonic acids and organic carboxylic acids having a pKa less than or equal to 5 and preferably less than or equal to 3;   . precursors of these acids; . salts of these acids and of an amino acid which is the same as or different from that or those used; . salts of these acids and of a polyimide derived from the polycondensation of at least one amino acid which is the same as or different from that or those used;   . hydrochloric acid and its precursors; . salts of hydrochloric acid and of an amino acid which is the same as or different from that or those used, when the amino acid to be polycondensed is other than glutamic acid; . salts of hydrochloric acid and of a polyimide derived from the polycondensation of at least one amino acid which is the same as or different from that or those used; . acid salts of sulphuric, phosphoric or phosphorous acids or their precursors; . precursors of phosphoric acid other than phosphorus pentoxide or polyphosphoric acids;   . and Lewis acids; according to an "acid catalyst"/amino acid molar ratio of at least 0.001. Use of the polyimides or of the polypeptide hydrolysates thus obtained in detergent compositions, and detergent compositions containing the said polyimides or hydrolysates.

Process for preparing polyimides or polypeptide
hydrolysates thereof with a biodegradability of at

least 80% (according to AFNOR standard T90-312 or ISO
international standard 7827), by bulk thermal

polymerization of at least one amino acid, in the
presence of at least one "acid catalyst" chosen from


sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphorous acid,
sulphurous acid, silicic acid, sulphonic acid,

organosulphonic acids containing less than 50 carbon
atoms, organophosphonic acids and organocarboxylic

acids with a pk
a
 of less than or equal to 5;
precursors of these acids;
salts of these acids and of an amino acid which may
be identical to or different from that or those used;
salts of these acids and of a polyimide derived from
the polycondensation of at least one amino acid which

may be identical to or different from that or those
used;
hydrochloric acid precursors or hydrofluoric acid
precursors;
salts of hydrochloric acid and of an amino acid which
may be identical to or different from that or those

used, when the amino acid to be polycondensed is
other than glutamic acid;
salts of hydrochloric acid and of a polyimide derived
from the polycondensation of at least one amino acid

which may be identical to or different from that or
those used; 
acid salts of sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or
phosphorous acid or precursors thereof;
phosphoric acid precursors other than phosphorus
pentoxide or polyphosphoric acids; and
Lewis acids;

optionally followed by hydrolysis,

the said process being characterized in that the
thermal polycondensation step is carried out with a

reaction medium which remains in pulverulent or friable
form throughout the polycondensation operation, in

which reaction medium the "acid catalyst" has been
distributed homogeneously by


slurrying a mixture of amino acid and of solid or
liquid acid catalyst with water (or any other volatile

liquid diluent), removal of the water (or of the
diluent) by evaporation under vacuum or at atmospheric

pressure, followed by grinding of the mass obtained;
or, when the amino acid is aspartic acid, preparation
of the aspartic acid by reaction of an organic or

inorganic acid and of ammonium aspartate, with
incorporation, by crystallization, of the solid "acid

catalyst" during the aspartic acid precipitation
operation;

in an "acid catalyst"/amino acid molar ratio of at
least 0.001.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that the "acid catalyst" is

acid,

sulphates of potassium, lithium, sodium or quaternary

ammonium, and SO
