<ABSTRACT>
A charging device for feeding a vessel with a predetermined flow rate of a solid material, comprising a hopper for material (18), a pipe for feeding (14) the vessel and a member (64) for retaining and adjusting the flow rate of material. This member includes a bell (66) for closing a discharge opening (72) and a central metering body (68) which is oblong and markedly more slender than the bell (66). The bell (66) and the central metering body (68) can move relative to one another in such a way that the distance which separates them both is freely adjustable.

Charging device for feeding an enclosure with a predetermined

flow rate of a solid material, comprising

a hopper (18) including a funnel-shaped lower part (44) which defines a
substantially vertical central outflow axis (12),
a pipe (14) for feeding the enclosure, which is situated axially below the
said lower part (44) of the hopper (18), and
a member (64) for retaining and for regulating the flow rate of material,
which includes a bell (66), which is movable inside the hopper (18) between a

lower position for closing off a discharge opening (72) in said lower part (44) of
the hopper (18) and an upper raised position, and a central metering body (68),

which is oblong and distinctly more slender than the bell (66), coaxial with said
central outflow axis (12) and movable along the latter so as to penetrate to a

greater or lesser degree through the said discharge opening (72) in the
direction of the feed pipe (14),

   
wherein
 the bell (66) and the said central metering body (68) are axially
movable relative to one another, so that the distance which separates the two

of them can be freely adjusted.
Charging device according to Claim 1, wherein the central
metering body (68) comprises a frustum (74, 76) which flares out firstly upwards

and which terminates in an upper end (78) which tapers in the direction of a
control rod (80) to which the central metering body is attached.
Charging device according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the bell (66)
includes a cavity entirely receiving the central metering body (68).
Charging device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, comprising
a lower sealing member (50) including a pivotable shutter (52) and a seat (54),

said seat (54) being mounted below the hopper (18) and provided with a
sealing surface (56) which points downwards.
Charging device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein
the bell (66) includes a sleeve (82) which is extended upwards axially through

the hopper (18), and wherein the central metering body includes a control rod
(80) guided axially in the sleeve (82). 
Charging device according to Claim 5, wherein at least one first
hydraulic cylinder (86, 88) is connected between the sleeve (82) and the hopper

(18), and at least a second hydraulic cylinder (94) is connected between the
sleeve (82) and the control rod (80).
Charging device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein
the hopper (18) includes a fixed guide sleeve (104) which extends axially

downwards inside the hopper (18),

the bell (66) includes a sleeve (102) which can be engaged on the fixed
sleeve (104),
the central metering body (68) includes a control rod (80) which is guided
axially inside the fixed sleeve (104),
at least a first hydraulic cylinder (106, 108) is connected between the
hopper (18) and the sleeve (102), and
at least a second hydraulic cylinder (114) is connected between the
hopper (18) and the control rod (80).
Charging device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, comprising
a lower sealing member (200) including


a closing off element (204) set out directly below the bell (216) and axially
movable with respect to the latter, said closing off element (204) including a

lateral peripheral surface (296) in which is incorporated an inflatable seal (298)
and a central passage opening (205) for the central metering body (208),
means (228) for moving the closing off element axially between a
protected position below the bell (216) and an operational position outside the

bell (216), when the latter is in the said lower closing off position, and
a seat (202) mounted axially below the discharge opening (72), the said
seat (202) including a first sealing surface (276) which points downwards and

which surrounds said inflatable seal (298) when the closing off element (204) is
situated in said operational position.
