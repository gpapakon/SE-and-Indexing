<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a machine for 
programmed electric wire cutting, tip stripping, and 

terminal clamping. The machine is of the type which 
comprises a unit for feeding the wire by traction, a cutting 

and stripping unit with three consecutive pairs of blades, 
and, upstream and downstream of the cutting and stripping 

unit, rotating units that are suitable to respectively move 
the leading and trailing ends of the cut portions towards 

corresponding terminal clamping presses. According to the 
invention, the blades of the stripping pairs, between which 

the cutting pair is interposed, are slideable on guides that 
belong to respective supports, are parallel to the wire 

advancement direction, and are associated with first 
motorized actuation means which are suitable to adjust their 

position. At least one of the blades of each pair is rigidly 
coupled, together with its support, independently of the 

cutting motion, so that it slides at right angles to the 
preceding pair and is associated with second motorized 

actuation means for adjusting its position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved machine 
for programmed electric wire cutting, tip stripping, and 
terminal clamping. Insulated electric wires provided, at their tips, with 
clamped-on terminals of various shapes and types, to be used 
for wiring, are currently in widespread use especially in 
the case of mass-produced equipment. In order to automatically perform the operations for 
cutting, stripping and clamping electric wires, machines 
have been produced and are currently used which are 
substantially composed of a unit for the traction feeding of 
the wire, a cutting and stripping unit with three 
consecutive sets of blades, and rotating units, located 
upstream and downstream of said cutting unit, which 
respectively move the leading and trailing ends of the cut 
portions towards corresponding terminal clamping presses. As regards the cutting and stripping unit, whereas the 
blades of the central cutting pair are in a fixed position 
and are actuated so that their cutting edges cut the wire 
completely, the blades of the stripping pairs must have an 
adjustable spacing from the blades of the central pair, 
according to the intended stripping length, and must be 
restrained in their cutting motion so as to cut only the 
sheath that covers the electric wire. Therefore the cutting depth must also be adjusted 
appropriately according to the diameter of the wire and to 
the thickness of the sheath. The distances of the pairs of stripping blades from the  
 
central cutting pair are currently adjusted manually by 
interposing appropriately gauged spacers after a troublesome 
disassembly and reassembly of the parts. The same holds for the adjustment of the cutting depth, 
for which there are shims to be placed between the blades 
and the corresponding supports. The aim of the present invention is to provide a 
machine for programmed electric wire cutting, tip stripping, 
and terminal clamping, in which the position of the 
stripping blades with respect to the cutting blades and the 
cutting depth of said blades can be adjusted automatically 
without having to disassemble and reassemble parts. A consequent primary object is to considerably reduce 
the time required to adapt the machine to production 
changes. Another object is to facilitate use on the part of the 
user. Another object is to provide a fully automatic machine 
that operates autonomously, without requiring the presence 
of operators, once it has been set. This aim, these objects, and others which will become 
apparent

<CLAIMS>
Improved machine for programmed electric wire 
cutting, tip stripping, and terminal clamping, of the type 

which comprises a unit for feeding the wire by traction, a 
cutting and stripping unit with three consecutive pairs of 

blades, and, upstream and downstream of said cutting and 
stripping unit, rotating units that are suitable to 

respectively move the leading and trailing ends of the cut 
portions towards corresponding terminal clamping presses, 

said machine being characterized in that the blades of the 
stripping pairs, between which the cutting pair is 

interposed, are slideable on guides that belong to 
respective supports, are parallel to the wire advancement 

direction, and are associated with first motorized actuation 
means which are suitable to adjust their position, at least 

one of the blades of each pair being rigidly coupled, 
together with its support, independently of the cutting 

motion, so that it slides at right angles to the preceding 
pair and is associated with second motorized actuation means 

for adjusting its position. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said first and second motorized actuation means are 

constituted by step motors, one for each movement. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said blades are vertically 

aligned with respect to the first upper blades of each pair, 
which are rigidly coupled to a movable block that is 

vertically slideable on rod-like guides and is motorized so 
as to perform reciprocating translatory cutting motions, 

 
whereas the second lower blades are slidingly movable on a 

fixed block from which shoulders extend laterally and 
support said guides. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the upper cutting blade is 

blocked between two aligned supports which are supported by 
said movable block, each one of said supports being shaped, 

in a downward region, so as to form a longitudinal guide to 
which a corresponding complementarily shaped end of one of 

the stripping blades is slidingly coupled, the cross-section 
of said guide being such that the corresponding blade hangs 

down from it. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the lower cutting blade is 

blocked between aligned supports which are vertically 
slideable along said fixed block, are associated with a 

motion actuator, and are configured, in an upward region, so 
as to form longitudinal guides with which complementarily 

shaped ends of the lower stripping blades engage. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each blade of each stripping 

unit is arranged without plays between oppositely arranged 
walls of a vertical slot formed on a corresponding sliding 

block that is slideable on guides which are parallel to the

in which the parts are mutually arranged so that the 
continuous rotary motion of said disk causes a reciprocating 

semi-rotary motion of said first pulley. 
Machine according to claim 8, characterized in that
