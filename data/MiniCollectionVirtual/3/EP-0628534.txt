prepared by the following stages: 

1) in a first stage, a propargyl alcohol of formula (5): 

 
and an aldehyde of formula (6): 


 
are reacted, the propargyl alcohol of formula (5) 

being treated beforehand with n-butyllithium, at a 
temperature between -70°C and -90°C, in a solvent, and 

then reacting with the aldehyde of formula (6) 
dissolved in a solvent, the temperature being progressively 

brought back to room temperature, so as to 
obtain the propargyl diol of formula (7): 


2) in a second stage, the propargyl diol of formula (7), 
in solution in a solvent, is reduced with the Lindlar  

 
catalyst in the presence of quinoline at room temperature, 

so as to obtain the diol of formula (8): 

 
and 
3) in a third stage, the diol of formula (8) is treated 
with benzoyl chloride in solution in a solvent, at 

room temperature, so as to obtain the dibenzoate of 
formula (2).

(5): 

 
is prepared by the following stages: 


1) in a first stage, the aldehyde of formula (9): 

 
is used as starting material, and it is reacted with 

triphenylphosphine and zinc powder in a solvent and 
then with CBr
4
, at room temperature, so as to obtain 
the dibromide of formula (10):
