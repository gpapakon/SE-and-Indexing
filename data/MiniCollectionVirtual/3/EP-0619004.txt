<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONFLUID COUPLINGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a fluid coupling and particularly to a two-part or two piece fluid handling coupling. Fluid couplings of this type are often used to join conduits together. For example, low spill hydraulic lines may be connected together with a two-part fluid handling coupling. In the chemical industry, fluid couplings are used to join conduits or hoses to fill and dispense chemicals from tanks.The primary objective of the present invention is to provide an improved fluid coupling which includes a keying system to ensure that only the correct male coupling part or half can be connected to the mating female coupling part or half. This prevents cross-mixing of fluids.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a fluid coupling having interconnectable male and female coupling parts or halves. Each of the coupling parts includes a coupling connection end and an axial passageway. The coupling parts include a valve adapted to open upon interconnection of the male and female coupling parts. One of the coupling parts includes at least one guide groove. The other of the coupling parts includes at least one key pin receivable by the guide groove. The key pin and guide groove must be aligned to interconnect the parts. If there are insufficient guide grooves or if the 

 guide grooves are not in correct circumferential alignment with the key pins, the coupling parts cannot be interconnected. The fluid coupling, according to the present invention, ensures that the correct coupling parts are joined together and tends to prevent conduit or container connections which are improper.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a fluid coupling, according to the present invention, utilized in a chemical supply system;Fig. 2 is an exploded, perspective view showing the male coupling part and the female coupling part of a fluid coupling, according to the present invention, in a disengaged position; andFig. 3 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a fluid coupling, according to the present invention, and showing the male and female coupling parts in the engaged position.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to the drawings, a fluid coupling, according to the present invention, is generally indicated by the reference number 10.The fluid coupling 10 is described in detail below. Another embodiment of a fluid coupling, similar to the fluid coupling 10, is disclosed in the assignee's U.S. Patent

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS:
1. A fluid coupling comprising, in combination, first and second coupling parts, each of said first and second coupling parts including a coupling connection end and a passageway, said first and second parts including a valve within the passageway adapted to open upon interconnection of said first and second coupling parts, one of said first and second coupling parts including at least one guide groove, said other of said first and said second parts including at least one key pin receivable by said guide groove, whereby said coupling parts can be interconnected upon alignment of said key pin with said guide groove and whereby said coupling parts cannot be interconnected without alignment of said key pin within said guide groove.
2. A fluid coupling, according to claim 1 , wherein said one of said first and second coupling parts includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced guide grooves and said other of said first and second coupling parts includes a plurality of key pins circumferentially positioned for reception by said guide grooves.
3. A fluid coupling, according to claim 1 , wherein said one of said first and second coupling parts includes two spaced guide grooves and said other of said first and second coupling parts includes two key pins spaced for reception by said two guide grooves. 


 4. A fluid coupling, according to claim 1 , wherein each of said key pins extends in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline of said other one of said first and second coupling parts and said guide grooves extend in a direction parallel to the longitudinal centerline of said one of said first and second coupling parts.
5. A fluid coupling comprising, in combination, male and female coupling parts, each of said male and female coupling parts including a coupling connection end and an axial passageway, said male and female parts including a valve within the passageway adapted to open upon interconnection of said male and female coupling parts, said male coupling part including at least one guide groove, said female part including at least one key pin receivable by said guide groove, whereby said male and female coupling parts can be interconnected upon alignment of said key pin with said guide groove and whereby said male and female coupling parts cannot be interconnected without alignment of said key pin within said guide groove. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 16 March 1993 (16.03.93); original claims 1 and 5 amended; other claims unchanged (2 pages)]
1. A fluid coupling comprising, in combination, first and second coupling parts, each of said first and second coupling parts including a coupling connection end and a passageway, said first and second parts including a valve within the passageway adapted to open upon interconnection of said first and second coupling parts, said first coupling part comprising a male coupling part having a nose surface defining at least one guide groove, said second coupling part comprising a female coupling having at least one key pin extending inwardly and receivable by said guide groove, whereby said coupling parts can be interconnected upon alignment of said key pin with said guide groove and whereby said coupling parts cannot be interconnected without alignment of said key pin within said guide groove.
2. A fluid coupling, according to claim 1 , wherein said one of said first and second coupling parts includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced guide grooves and said other of said first and second coupling parts includes a plurality of key pins circumferentially positioned for reception by said guide grooves.
3. A fluid coupling, according to claim 1 , wherein said one of said first and second coupling parts includes two spaced guide grooves and said other of said first and second coupling parts includes two key pins spaced for reception by said two guide grooves. 


 4. A fluid coupling, according to claim 1 , wherein each of said key pins extends in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal . centerline of said other one of said first and second coupling parts and said guide grooves extend in a direction parallel to the longitudinal centerline of said one of said first and second coupling parts.
5. A fluid coupling comprising, in combination, male and female coupling parts, each of said male and female coupling parts including a coupling connection end and an axial passageway, said male and female parts including a valve within the passageway adapted to open upon interconnection of said male and female coupling parts, said male coupling part having a nose surface defining at least one guide groove, said female part defining a recessed opening at one end, including at least one key pin extending inwardly within such recessed opening and receivable by said guide groove, whereby said male and female coupling parts can be interconnected upon alignment of said key pin with said guide groove and whereby said male and female coupling parts cannot be interconnected without alignment of said key pin within said guide groove. 

STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 19
The International Search Report has indicated that the Collar et al. United States Patent No. 3,314,447 is a document of particular relevance from which the claimed invention cannot be considered novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step when the document is taken alone. Applicants have amended the independent claims of the International Application, namely claims 1 and 5, after reviewing the disclosure in the Collar et al. patent to distinguish the novelty and inventive step ÏƒfApplicant's invention in view of the Collar et al. patent.
It has been found, that it is preferable to place the inwardly extending lock pins within the female socket section coupling part and the aligned grooves within the nose surface of the male part, as specifically shown in Fig. 2 of the application drawings. The key pins 63 (see Fig. 2) which extend inwardly into the recess opening defined in the end of the female part are thereby protected from bending. If the key pins are bent, a misalignment can results with the grooves 60 defined in the male part 13.
It is respectfully submitted that claims 1-5 now present proper novelty and inventive step when taken in view of the cited documents of record.
