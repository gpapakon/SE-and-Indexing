<ABSTRACT>
Mfr. of a venturi unit, having several parallel venturis involves mfg. a block-like venturi unit from the venturi material, the interspaces between the venturis being filled with the material. Also claimed are (i) a venturi unit made by the above method; and (ii) use of the above unit in a venturi scrubber. Pref. the unit may be mfd. by original moulding, injection moulding or casting or may be machined from a block. The material may be a non-metallic material (esp. plastics) or a metallic material.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the manufacture of a venturi constructional unit with a plurality
of venturis arranged in parallel and made of a material for a venturi washer

for cleaning of a gas with a liquid,

characterized in that from a single material a block-like venturi
constructional unit is manufactured while forming the venturi delimitation

and while simultaneously filling up the interstices between venturis with
material.
The method according to claim 1,

characterized in that the block-like venturi constructional unit is
manufactured by primary shaping, moulding or casting.
The method according to claim 1,

characterized in that first a block-like work piece is made of the material
and thereafter the venturis are formed in the block by material removal,

especially by cutting forming.
The method according to at least one of the claims 1-3,

characterized in that as a material a non metallic material, especially
plastic, or a metallic material is used.
The method according to at least one of the claims 1-4,

characterized in that the venturi constructional unit is formed in a
cylindrical manner or a parallelepipedal manner.
Venturi constructional unit with a plurality of venturis arranged in parallel
for a venturi washer for cleaning a gas with a liquid,

characterized in that venturi constructional unit (3) is formed in a block-like
manner from a single material while forming the venturis and while

simultaneously filling up the interstices (28) between the venturis (27). 
Venturi constructional unit according to claim 6,

characterized in that the venturis (27) are arranged in closest cylinder
packing.
Venturi constructional unit according to claim 6,

characterized in that the venturis (27) are arranged on concentrical circles.
Venturi constructional unit according to claim 8,

characterized in that the venturis (27) are arranged in rows (30a, 30b, 30c,
30d, 30e) in a regular manner.
Venturi constructional unit according to at least one of the claims 6-9,
characterized in that they are formed in a cylindrical or parallelepipedal

manner.
Venturi constructional unit according to at least one of the claims 6-9,
characterized in that the unit is provided with a connection flange (21).
Venturi washer with a washing container, at least one venturi
constructional unit according to at least one of the claims 6-11 arranged in

the washing container and a spray unit for the supply of washing liquid on
the blow side of the venturi constructional unit

characterized in that transversally through the washing container (1) a
carrier plate (2) having a plurality of passage openings (19) extends, in

each of the passage openings a venturi construcional unit is arranged and
in that spaced from the carrier plate (2) for each venturi constructional unit

(3) a single nozzle (6) for the washing liquid (W) is arranged, which is
directed to the onflow side (20) of the venturi constructional unit (3).
Venturi washer according to claim 12,

characterized in that in case of a venturi washer with a plurality of venturi
constructional units arranged in parallel the venturi constructional units (3)

are arranged substantially in equal distribution over the carrier plate (2).
