<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for receiving a signal used in a synchronous digital telecommunication system. The method comprises pointer interpretation in which the receiver has three possible main states, between which it undergoes transitions under the control of event counters, the main states being a normal state (NORM), a loss of pointer state (LOP) and an alarm state (AIS), said counters counting predetermined events in each main state, said events comprising the reception of alarm data indicating an alarm (AIS-ind), the reception of a new data flag indicating a new pointer value (NDF-enable), the reception of the active pointer (active-point), and the reception of an invalid pointer (inv-point). In order for the fault tolerance of the system to be improved, all the pointers which do not indicate an alarm, a new data flag or the active pointer are considered invalid in the normal state (NORM).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to
the preamble of the accompanying claim 1 for receiving
a signal used in a synchronous digital telecommunication
system.The current digital transmission network is
plesiochronous, that is each 2-Mbit/s basic multiplex
system has a dedicated clock independent of any other
system. It is therefore impossible to locate a single
2-Mbit/s signal in the bit stream of a higher-order
system, but the higher-level signal has to be
demultiplexed through each intermediate level down to
the 2 Mbit/s level to extract the 2-Mbit/s signal. For
this reason, especially the construction of branch connections
requiring several multiplexers and demultiplexers
has been expensive. Another disadvantage of the
plesiochronous transmission network is that equipments
from two different manufacturers are not usually compatible.The above drawbacks, among other things, have
led to the introduction of the new synchronous digital
hierarchy SDH specified in the CCITT recommendations
G.707, G.708 and G.709. The synchronous digital
hierarchy is based on STM-N transfer frames (Synchronous
Transport Modules) located on several levels of hierarchy
N (N=1,4,16...). Existing PCM systems, such as 2,
8- and 32-Mbit/s systems, are multiplexed into a synchronous
155.520-Mbit/s frame of the lowest level of the
SDH (N=l). Consistently with the above, this frame is
called the STM-1 frame. On the higher levels of
hierarchy the bit rates are multiples of the bit rate
of the lowest level. In principle, all nodes of the
synchronous transmission network are synchronized into 
one clock. If some of the nodes should, however, lose
connection with the common clock, it would lead to
problems in the connections between the nodes. The phase
of the frame must also be easy to recognize in the
reception. For the reasons stated above, a pointer has
been introduced in the SDH telecommunications, said
pointer being a number which indicates the phase of the
payload within the frame, i.e. the pointer indicates
that byte in the STM frame from which the payload
begins.Figure 1 illustrates the structure of an STM-N
frame, and Figure 2 illustrates a single STM-1 frame.
The STM-N frame comprises a matrix with 9 rows and
N x 270 columns so that there is one byte at the
junction point between each row and the column. Rows 1-3
and rows 5-9 of the N x 9 first columns comprise a
section overhead SOH, and row 4 comprises an AU pointer.
The rest of the frame structure is formed of a section
having the length of N x 261 columns and
