<ABSTRACT>
Reagents and methods for determining the fructosamine content in 
a blood sample or a sample derived from blood are disclosed. 
It is proposed: 

a set of reagents for determining the fructosamine content in a blood 
sample or a sample derived from blood, comprising two stable ready to use 

liquid reagents, the first liquid reagent having an nearby neutral pH and 
containing a colour reagent, which is reduced by fructosamine under 

alkaline pH conditions, thereby changing the colour, and reagents for 
removing non specifically reducing and/or turbidity-causing components of 

the sample, as well as possibly other usual additives, and the second liquid 
reagent containing a basic buffering agent, 
a method of determining the content of fructosamine in a blood sample 
or a sample derived from blood which uses the above set of reagents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of determining
the fructosamine content in a blood sample or
a sample derived from blood, by treating the sample
with a colour reagent and measuring the induced
change of colour, whereby non specifically reducing
and/or turbidity-causing components of the sample
are removed during the colour reaction, wherein that
a first liquid reagent having a pH between 6 and 9
and containing an appropriate non reducing buffering
agent, a colour reagent, which is reduced by fructosamine
under alkaline pH conditions, thereby changing the colour,
and reagents for removing non specifically reducing and/or
turbidity-causing components of the sample, is mixed
with a second liquid containing a basic buffering agent,
and, simultaneously or subsequently, the colour reaction
is started by adding the sample, whereby the second liquid
reagent is used in such an amount as to adjust the
pH of the reaction mixture between 9 and 12.The expression "fructosamine content" means the total content of non
enzymatic glycosylation stably attached to proteins. This parameter, which
reflects an average blood glucose levels over a period of time, is useful for
monitoring metabolic control in diabetes.The expression "non specifically reducing components" means here
blood components other than fructosamine which, under alkaline pH
conditions, are capable of reducing the colour reagent. Such components
may be bilirubin, uric acid and proteins with free thiol groups, as well as
vitamins such as ascorbic acid and pharmaceutical metabolites, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid, a metabolite of acetylsalycilic acid.The expression "turbidity-causing components" means non watersoluble
blood components such as lipids, which are capable of causing
turbidity in samples.European Patent Publication No. 85 263 describes a simple method of
determining the fructosamine content in serum samples. This method is
based on the fact that fructosamines in alkaline solution form eneaminols
which act as reducing agents on tetrazolium salts, such as for instance
nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT), thereby causing a change in colour which can
be photometrically determined, the measured change in colour in a defined
time interval being proportional to the quantity of the present fructosamines.  This method however has a number of drawbacks. Problems may arise
in particular when using serum as sample material, because other serum
components, such as bilirubin, uric acid or proteins with free thiol groups
also act as reducing agents on the colour
