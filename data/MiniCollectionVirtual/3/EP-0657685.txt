<ABSTRACT>
A lighting system incorporates a replaceable module (50) that 
carries a light 

source (10) and reflector (24). A mounting assembly (52) and the module 
(50) have cooperating 

components (66,68,70,74,76) that quickly and accurately locate the module 
(50) relative to an input 

end (62) of the light distribution arrangement. In the preferred 
embodiment, the 

light distribution arrangement includes a light conductor (54) that is 
fixed on the 

mounting assembly (52) so that positioning a replacement module (50) 
on the 

mounting assembly (52) accurately locates the input end (62) of the light 
conductor (54) at 

one of the foci of the reflector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the art of high 
brightness light systems and more particularly to an 
easily replaceable light source module that provides 
for accurate and repeatable alignment of the light 
source with a light distribution system. The invention is particularly applicable to a high 
brightness light source such as an arc discharge lamp 
used in a central lighting system and will be described 
with particular reference thereto. However, it will be 
appreciated that the invention has broader applications 
and may be employed in related environments and 
applications. Central lighting systems wherein a single light 
source is used to supply light to a light distribution 
apparatus is known in the art. In fact, the light 
distribution apparatus will usually incorporate one or 
more optical light conductors, such as optical tubes, 
rods, or fibers, to transmit the light from the 
centrally located source to one or more remote 
locations. For example, commonly assigned U.S. Patent 
No. 4,958,263 issued to Davenport, et al. discloses the 
use of a central lighting system for an automotive 
application. The subject invention, however, should 
not be considered as being limited to automotive 
applications but will find widespread applicability 
wherever centralized light sources using a light 
distribution member for transmitting the source light 
to a remote location is desired. Transmission losses associated with conveying  
 
light from the source to a remote location necessitate 
employing a suitable light source having a high 
brightness characteristic. For example, a known high 
brightness light source provides in excess of 50,000 
lumens per square centimeter and is more particularly 
described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
5,239,230 to Mathews, et al. The source is used in 
conjunction with a reflector, such as an ellipsoidal 
shaped reflector where the light source is located at 
one focus of the reflector and an input end of the 
light distribution apparatus is advantageously located 
at the second focus of the ellipsoidal reflector. In 
other related arrangements, a mirror may be interposed 
between the reflector and input end of the light 
distribution apparatus so that different orientations 
and light control arrangements may be achieved. The lamp will burn out after extended use thereby 
requiring replacement. As will be appreciated, the 
spatial orientation of the light source and reflector 
relative to the input end of the distribution apparatus 
is extremely important. In

<CLAIMS>
A lighting apparatus for providing light to at least one remote 
location, the lighting apparatus comprising: 

   a modular, selectively removable housing; 
   a light source received in the housing; 

   a reflector received in the housing and disposed to receive light 
from the light source and direct the light in a predetermined manner from the 

housing; 
   a light distribution apparatus having an input end receiving light 

from the reflector and distributing light to a remote location from the housing; 
and 

   a mounting assembly selectively receiving the housing in a 
predetermined relationship relative to the input end of the light distribution 

apparatus so that mere replacement of the housing on the mounting 
assembly properly orients the light source relative to the input end of the light 

distribution apparatus. 
The lighting apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein the mounting 
assembly and the input end of the light distribution apparatus are rigidly 

secured together. 
The lighting apparatus as defined in claim 2 wherein the mounting 
assembly includes a stop surface that engages the housing and limits further 

advancement of the housing toward the input end of the light distribution 
apparatus. 
The lighting apparatus as defined in claim 3 further comprising 

means for retaining the housing against the stop surface. 
The lighting apparatus as defined in claim 4 wherein the retaining 
means includes a spring urging the housing against the stop surface. 
The lighting apparatus as defined in claim 3 wherein the stop 
surface is spaced from the input end of the light distribution apparatus. 
The lighting apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein the housing 
and mounting assembly have a slot and groove attachment permitting ease 

of mounting the housing thereto. 
The lighting apparatus as defined in claim 7 wherein the slot and 
groove attachment are vertically oriented and the mounting assembly includes 

a stop surface that limits advancement of the housing toward the input end 
of the light distribution apparatus. 
The lighting apparatus as defined in claim 7 further comprising 
means for retaining the housing and mounting assembly together.
