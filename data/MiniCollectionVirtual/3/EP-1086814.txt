<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording head including: a chamber
housing (17) which defines a plurality of pressure

chambers (172); a plurality of piezoelectric elements (11)
on the chamber housing (17) corresponding to one of said

pressure chambers (172), each of said piezoelectric
elements (11) having thereon first and second electrode

(13, 14), each of the electrodes (13, 14) having an
electrode terminal; and a circuit board (21) having side

surfaces mounting thereon a drive terminal (22) disposed
for each of said electrode terminals, and wherein the

electrode terminal and a corresponding one of said drive
terminals (22) are connected together. Since the

piezoelectric elements (11) and the circuit board (21) are
connected with each other by a solidified solder fillet (23),

an excellent long-term reliability of the recording head
and a reduction of a defection rate thereof can be secured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inkjet recording
head and a method for manufacturing the same, more in
particular to a piezoelectric element corresponding a
pressure chamber and a connection structure with a
driving circuit for providing a driving signal to the
piezoelectric element and a method for connecting the
same.A conventional inkjet recording head shown in Fig.1
includes a stacked chamber 17 which has thereon a pair
of stacked piezoelectric elements 11 opposing to each
other.The stacked piezoelectric elements 11 formed to be
comb-like include a plurality of internal electrodes 12 at
the comb-like portion. At the comb-like portion, internal
electrodes 12 having one end exposed to the outside of the
opposing piezoelectric elements 11, and internal 
electrodes 12' having one end exposed between the
opposing piezoelectric elements 11 are alternately
stacked.On both the ends (front surface of bottom surface in
direction perpendicular to the surface of the drawing) of
the comb-like portions of the respective piezoelectric
elements 11, the three internal electrodes 12 exposing the
respective one ends to the outside of the piezoelectric
elements 11 are connected to one other by a longitudinal
external electrode 13 for common signals, and the three
internal electrodes 12' having one end exposed between
the opposing piezoelectric elements 11 are connected to
one other by a longitudinal external electrode for
connecting common electrodes 16. On both the ends of the
comb-like portion, the six internal electrodes 12 exposing
to the front surface of the piezoelectric element 11 are
connected to one other by a longitudinal external
electrode 13 for connecting the internal electrodes 15.On three comb-like portions in the middle of the
piezoelectric element 11, the three internal electrodes 12
exposing the respective one ends to the outside of the
piezoelectric elements 11 are connected to one other by a
longitudinal external electrode 14 for individual signals,
and the three internal electrodes 12' having one end
internally exposed are connected to one other by an 
external electrode 16 for connecting common electrodes
The plurality of the external electrode 16 for connecting
common electrodes in each of the piezoelectric elements
11 are connected to one other by a connecting plate 16a.A printing circuit board 19 mounting an IC chip 110
for switching is connected to the longitudinal external
electrode 13 for the common signals and the longitudinal
external electrode 14 for the individual signals through
