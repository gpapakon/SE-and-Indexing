<ABSTRACT>
New transgenic, pathogen-resistant organisms have a genome contg. at least 2 different genes, under control of active promoters, with pathogen-inhibiting activity. Also new are DNA transfer vectors contg. inserted DNA sequences for prepn. of such organisms. Partic. the genes (of fungal, bacterial, animal, plant or viral origin) encode products that reduce the viability of fungi, esp. chitinase; glucanase; protein-synthesis inhibitor (PSI) or antifungal protein (AFP). The transgenic organism is pref. a plant, esp. tobacco, potato, strawberry, maize, rape or tomato. The specification includes nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for AFP of Aspergilllus giganteus (275 bp); PSI of Hordeum vulgare (1079 bp); exo-chitinase (ChiS) of Serratia marcescens (2329 bp); chitinase G of H. vulgare (1013 bp), and glucanase of H. vulgare (1249 bp).

<CLAIMS>
Transgenic, fungus-resistant plant whose genome comprises at least two
different gene sequences which code for proteins with fungus-inhibiting effects

under the control of active promoters, 
characterized by
 DNA sequences
coding for:


(a) at least one PSI protein comprising the amino acid sequence according
to the sequence ID No. 4, and
(b) a ChiS protein comprising the amino acid sequence of the gene product
of the sequence according to sequence ID No. 8 or a AFP protein comprising

the amino acid sequence according to sequence ID No. 3.
Fungus-resistant plant according to claim 1 and said plant obtained by at least
one gene being transferred into the genome of a plant which codes for a protein

with a fungus-inhibiting effect and the fungus-resistant plant being obtained
by


(a) crossing of said plant with another optionally transgenic plant which
contains at least another gene which codes for another gene with a

fungus-inhibiting effect, followed by selection or
(b) transformation of said plant with at least another gene which codes for
another protein with a fungus-inhibiting effect.
Said plant according to claims 1 or 2 being a tobacco, potato, strawberry,
corn, rape or tomato plant.
A process for generation of fungus-resistant plants according to any of claims
1 to 3, 
characterized by
 at least one gene, which codes for a protein, with a

fungus-inhibiting effect according to claim 1, being transferred into the genome
of one plant and the fungus-resistant plant being obtained 


(a)' by crossing of said plant with another, optionally transgenic, plant comprising
at least another gene which codes for another protein, with a

fungus-inhibiting effect, as defined in claim 1, followed by selection, or
(b)' by transformation of said plant with at least another gene, which codes
for another protein, with a fungus-resistant effect according to claim 1.
A process for generation of a plant with improved fungus-resistance wherein
said process comprises transformation of a plant with at least two different

gene sequences, coding for proteins with a fungus-inhibiting effect with the
proviso that the DNA sequences code for:


(a) at least one PSI protein comprising the amino acid sequence according
to the sequence ID No. 4, and
(b) a ChiS protein comprising the amino acid sequence of the gene product
of the sequence according to sequence ID No. 8 or a AFP protein comprising

the amino acid sequence according to sequence ID No. 3.
