<ABSTRACT>
A process control system for a machine for 
manufacturing glass articles comprising a display, a 

computer memory for storing information including 
text related to selected areas of the machine and an 

overview illustration of the machine illustrating all 
of the selected areas, means for presenting the 

overview illustration on the display, means for 
presenting a help button for each of the selected 

areas of the presented overview illustration, means 
for presenting a distributed help window on the 

display corresponding to a selected help button, the 
help window listing at least one help topic, means

<DESCRIPTION>
Glass articles (containers and tableware) are 
manufactured on complicated machines such as I.S. 
(individual section) machines or H-28 machines. An 
operator of one of these machines relies heavily on 
key materials to service, set up, or operate or 
otherwise control the article manufacturing process 
carried out by the machine. Among these are an 
operator's manual, drawings, dictionaries, parts 
lists and video materials like training films and the 
like. The effective use of these materials, which are 
conventionally located at a variety of locations, is 
time consuming since they must be appropriately 
accessed. The invention generally comprises a help system 
for a machine for manufacturing glass articles 
comprising a display, characterized by
 
   means for storing information including 
text related to selected discrete areas of the 
machine and an overview illustration of the machine 
illustrating all of said selected discrete areas,
 
   means for presenting said overview illustration on said 
display,
 
   means for presenting a help button in 
association with each of said selected discrete areas 
on said presented overview illustration,
 
   means for presenting a distributed help 
window on said display corresponding to a selected 
help button, said help window listing at least one 
help topic,
 
   means for selecting one of said listed 
help topics,
 
   a text button,
 
   means for presenting a second window on  
 
said display including the portion of said text 
related to said selected help topic when said text 
button is actuated. It is accordingly an object of the present 
invention to greatly improve the productivity of the 
operator in carrying out these process control 
functions. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following 
portion of this specification and from the accompanying 
drawings which illustrate in accordance with the 
mandate of the patent statutes a presently preferred 
embodiment incorporating the principles of the 
invention. Referring to the drawings: 
Figure 1 is a CRT presented schematic showing of a 
control system overview of a glass article manufacturing 
machine; Figures 2 and 4 through 8 illustrates the CRT 
display at various times; and Figure 3 is a schematic representation of the 
PC shown in Figure 1; Figures 9A and 9B are a flow diagram 
illustrating the operation of the PC. An H-28 machine forms glass articles (tableware 
like tumblers, for example) from gobs of molten 
glass. It has two basic
