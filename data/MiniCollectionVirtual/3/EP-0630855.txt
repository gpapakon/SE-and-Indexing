<ABSTRACT>
The synthesized inorganic crystalline ion exchange 
material comprises a composition having the following 

general formula (I) in an anhydride form:


xM₂O·ySiO₂·zM'O,   (I) 



 
wherein M represents Na and/or K; M' represents Ca and/or 

Mg; y/x is 1.4 to 2.1; z/x is 0.001 to 1.0; K/Na in M₂O is 
0 to 8.0; and Mg/Ca in M'O is 0 to 100. 
The inorganic ion exchange material of the 
present invention is excellent in both cationic exchange 

capacity and anti-solubility, making it useful to be used 
for a water softener and an alkalinity adjusting agent in 

detergents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synthesized
inorganic ion exchange material and a detergent
composition containing the same, and more specifically to
a synthesized inorganic ion exchange material excellent in
ion exchange capacity and alkaline capacity, and having
anti-solubility in water, and a detergent composition
containing such a synthesized inorganic ion exchange
material.To date, a large number of chelating agents, ion
exchange materials, precipitants, dispersants and other
substances have been reported to be used for detergent
builders. In recent years, the use of tripolyphosphates
has decreased, since they can cause eutrophication in
closed freshwater areas such as lakes and marshes.
Instead, crystalline aluminosilicates, typically those
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 50-12381 and
51-12805, have been commonly used.Although sodium silicate has an ion exchange capacity
not less than that of zeolite, its use has been limited
since it is soluble in water. As a means for solving this 
problem, a method in which sodium silicate is thermally
dehydrated, baked and powdered is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 60-239320, and a method in which part
of the silicon of sodium silicate is isomorphously
replaced with aluminum in a similar manner is disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 3-93649. However, both
methods have problems in that the obtained anti-solubility
is insufficient and the ion exchange capacity is low.
Also, crystalline calcium silicate alkali hydrates
obtained by hydrothermal synthesis are disclosed in
Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 61-59245, but
they are substantially unsuitable as detergent builders
because of their low ion exchange capacity, though they
have sufficient anti-solubility in water. Moreover,
because their grain shape is in the form of coarse long
fiber or mica, their aqueous dispersibility is low so that
the actual ion exchange capacity shows further reduction.
Also, DD-279234A1 publication discloses a crystalline
magnesium-containing silicate obtained by hydrothermal
synthesis, but there is a problem in that this silicate is
extremely low in ion exchange capacity, making it
impossible to be practically used as a detergent builder.As described above, it has been difficult to obtain
an inorganic ion exchange material which is excellent in
both anti-solubility in water and ion exchange capacity,
and the development of such an inorganic ion exchange
material having improvements in these properties has been 
in demand.EP-A 550 048 discloses
