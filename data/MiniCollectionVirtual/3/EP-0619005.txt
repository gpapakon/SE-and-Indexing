<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a frame (20) having a die (12) pivotally connected to it at one end and anchorage means (26) pivotally connected to it at the other end. The anchorage means carries a first roller (28). A second roller (30) is adjustable transverse to the frame (20). A pipe pusher (40) is integral with the die (12). The frame has adjustable legs (50, 52) and adjustable arms (60) to suit the angle of the frame (20). A polyethylene pipe (10) is pulled through the die (12) and through the host pipe (14) and is bent between the roller (30), the roller (28) and the die (12). The frame fully contains the reactions arising owing to the bending of the pipe (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR BENDING PLASTIC PIPEThe invention relates to apparatus for bending plastic pipe.Equipment is known by which a polyethylene pipe is pulled through a die and through a host pipe, for example a gas main. The die reduces the diameter of the polyethylene pipe which, when the pulling force is removed, recovers its diameter and becomes a close fit within the host pipe. Such equipment was also used in which a pipe pusher was incorporated, the pusher repeatedly gripping the pipe and pushing the pipe into the host pipe.In the known equipment, the host pipe was required to react the bending of the polyethylene pipe as it entered the host pipe. This added to the frictional resistance and the total force required to pull the polyethylene pipe through the host pipe.The invention provides apparatus for bending plastic pipe which is useful in methods in which the plastic pipe is passed into a host pipe whether the plastic pipe is first reduced in diameter by passing it through a die or alternatively the plastic pipe is installed in the host pipe as a loose liner. 

 Apparatus for bending plastic pipe before it enters a host pipe, according to the invention, comprises a structure which is elongated in the direction in which said plastic pipe enters said host pipe and which has a first end and a second end, anchorage means intended to be secured to an entry end of a host pipe and pivotally connected to said structure at said second end thereof about a first horizontal axis, first, second and third guides intended for engagement, respectively, with the under surface, the top surface and the under surface of said plastic pipe, said first guide being mounted on said structure at said first end thereof, said third guide being mounted on said anchorage means and said second guide being mounted on said structure intermediate said first and third guides, said guides being profiled to accommodate said plastic pipe and said second guide being adjustable between an upper retracted position and a lower working position, and means connected to said structure engageable with the ground and adjustable according to the inclination of said structure about said first horizontal axis, said plastic pipe being advanced relative to said structure with said second guide in its retracted position until the leading end of said plastic pipe engages said third guide, than said second guide being adjusted to said lower position to bend said plastic pipe to enable the leading end of said pipe to enter said host pipe

CLAIMS
1. Apparatus for bending plastic pipe before it enters a host pipe comprising a structure which is elongated in the direction in which said plastic pipe enters said host pipe and which has a first end and a second end, anchorage means intended to be secured to an entry end of a host pipe and pivotally connected to said structure at said second end thereof about a first horizontal axis, first, second and third guides intended for engagement, respectively, with the under surface, the top surface and the under surface of said plastic pipe, said first guide being mounted on said structure at said first end thereof, said third guide being mounted on said anchorage means and said second guide being mounted on said structure intermediate said first and third guides, said guides being profiled to accommodate said plastic pipe and said second guide being adjustable between an upper retracted position and a lower working position, and means connected to said structure engageable with the ground and adjustable according to the inclination of said structure about said first horizontal axis, said plastic pipe being advanced relative to said structure with said second guide in its retracted position until the leading end of said plastic pipe engages said third guide, then said second guide being adjusted to said lower position to bend said plastic pipe to enable the leading end of said pipe to enter said host pipe coaxially.
2. Apparatus according to claim 1 in which at least one of said guides is a roller rotatable about a horizontal axis transverse to said direction. 


 3. Apparatus according to claim 1 in which said first guide is a circular die mounted on said structure for rotation about a horizontal diametral axis.
4. Apparatus according to claim 3 in which a frame is integral with said die and a pipe pusher is reciprocable along said frame by hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder means.
5. Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which a frame is integral with said first guide and a pipe pusher is reciprocable along said frame by hydraulic ,or pneumatic cylinder means.
6. Apparatus according to claim 1 substantially as described herein with reference to Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings.
7. Apparatus according to claim 1 substantially as described herein with reference to Figures 3 and 4 or Figures 5 and 6 of the accompanying drawings.
