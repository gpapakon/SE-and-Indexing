<ABSTRACT>
An in bed infant scale for use with an infant care center and which may be 
slid underneath the infant platform of the infant care center while the 

infant is positioned within the center and which causes little disruption 
to the infant. The infant scale is thus movable from infant care center to 

infant care center conveniently. The infant scale is easily slid into the 
infant care center and raises the infant platform on which the infant is 

positioned such that the infant platform is raised off of its position on 
its supporting frame and becomes fully supported on the infant scale. Thus 

the infant scale can weigh the infant platform and the infant resting on 
that infant platform.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for weighing an infant
and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method of weighing an infant
contained in an infant treatment apparatus and where the infant may be
weighed with minimal disruption to the infant.Newborn infants are generally cared for through the use of various types of
medical equipment that provide certain functions to assist the infant. For
example, premature infants are normally contained for a period of time
within an incubator so that they may have a controlled environment to
assist in their growth and survival. In other instances, an infant warmer
may by used and which comprises an infant platform on which the infant
rests, allowing attention to be given to the infant and which also provides
heating to the infant by overhead heaters and/or light radiation for
phototherapy.In either case, it is desirable to have a means of weighing the infant
periodically as a indication of its well-being and growth. One of the
characteristics desired in carrying out the weighing operation is to
maintain the infant as free of disruption as possible and therefore the
operation should have a minimum of movement and positioning to the infant.
Also, since some of the apparatus that contains and treats the infant is
used without the need to weigh the infant, it is desirable that the scale
is not permanently built in to the apparatus as the additional cost is not
always justifiable if the weighing apparatus is not needed.Many of the common ways today of weighing infants are disruptive of the
infant and require considerable repositioning of the infant. Commonly, one
means is to remove the infant from the treatment apparatus in order to
carry out the weighing procedure. Upon completion of the procedure, the
infant is returned to the protected environment. The procedure not only
disrupts the infant but removes it from the environment established to
protect and support the infant. In some infant warmers, a scale can be installed beneath the infant,
however, the installation requires considerable disruption of the warmer
unit. Thus, if an infant is currently in a unit not having such a scale
already installed, the infant must be moved to a different unit or
maintained somewhere else while the infant support and mattress from the
warmer is removed and a cumbersome infant scale inserted into the infant
compartment. Upon installation of the scale, the infant support is
returned to rest on top of the infant scale and then the infant is replaced
in the unit. In

<CLAIMS>
An infant care apparatus having a frame (10) including a lower support (50) and spaced
therefrom an upper support (52), an infant platform (48) resting upon said upper support (52) and

adapted to underlie an infant, weighing means (32) dimensioned to be slid between said lower
support (50) and said upper support (52) underneath said infant platform (48) to lift said infant

platform (48) from said upper support (52) such that the infant platform (48) is fully supported by
said weighing means (32), said weighing means (32) thereby ascertaining the weight of the infant

platform (48) and objects resting upon said infant platform (48) including the infant.
An infant care apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the apparatus is an infant warmer and
includes a heater (28).
An infant care apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein the infant platform (48) has lateral
edges (56) and the frame (10) has at least one lateral edge (54) adjacent to and parallel with a

lateral edge (56) of the infant platform (48), the weighing means (32) being adapted to slide
underneath the infant platform (48) in a first direction towards the lateral edge (54) of the frame (10)

to raise the infant platform (48) with respect to the frame (10) and causing said lateral edge (56)
of said infant platform (48) to abut against said lateral edge (54) of said frame (10), and means to

move said infant platform (48) a slight distance in a direction away from said lateral edge (54) of
said frame (10) to create a clearance between said lateral edge (56) of said infant platform (48)

and said lateral edge (54) of said frame (10) to allow free movement therebetween.
An infant care apparatus as claimed in Claim 3, wherein said means to move said infant support
a slight distance in a direction away from said lateral edge (54) of said frame (10) comprises at

least one detent (40, 42, 44, 46) formed in said weighing means (32) and at least one detent (74,
76, 78, 80) formed in said infant platform (48), said detents being positioned to interengage each

other to seat said infant platform (48) in a predetermined position with respect to said weighing
means (32).
An infant care apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, in which said infant platform (48) has at least one
downwardly inclined plane (70, 72), said weighing means (32) having at least one upstanding

flange (38, 39) that aligns with said at least one downwardly inclined plane (70, 72) of said infant 
platform (48) to raise said infant platform (48) off from said frame (10), said at least one

upstanding flange (38, 39) having a detent (40, 42, 44, 46) and said at least one downwardly
inclined plane (70, 72) having a detent (74, 76, 78, 80), said detents being adapted to engage

each other and cause said infant platform (10) to move in a direction opposite to said first
direction to disengage said abutting portions of said peripheral lateral edges (56) of said infant

platform (48) and said at least one lateral edge (54) of said frame (10) and to support said infant
platform (48) in a predetermined fixed position fully supported upon said weighing means (32)

such that said infant platform (48) can freely move with respect to said frame (10) for weighing
said infant platform (48) by said weighing means (32).
An infant care apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the said detent on said downwardly
inclined plane (70, 72) comprises a male detent (74, 76, 78, 80) having a apex (82, 84, 86, 88)

that seats within said detent (40, 42, 44, 46) of said at least one upstanding flange (38, 39).
A method of weighing an infant resting upon an infant platform (48) supported upon an upper
support (52) of a frame (10) including a lower support (50) and spaced therefrom said upper

support (52), said method comprising the steps of:

sliding an infant scale (32) into the separation between said lower support (50) and said
upper support (52) underneath said infant platform (48) to lift said infant platform (48)

from said upper support (52), said separation being dimensioned to receive said infant
scale (32);
supporting the infant platform (48) wholly upon said infant scale (32); and
ascertaining the weight of the infant from the infant scale (32).
