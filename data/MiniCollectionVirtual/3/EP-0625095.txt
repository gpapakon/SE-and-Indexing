<ABSTRACT>
Nozzles for an ink jet printer are formed by laser ablation in a nozzle plate (24) which has previously been bonded to the body of the printer (16). The laser beam is caused to converge at a point in front of the nozzle plate (24) so that a nozzle is formed which tapers toward the outlet. First and second beam masks (72, 74) are established in front of a focussing lens with the masks being respectively conjugate in the lens with the nozzle inlet and outlet, which are of different shape. The nozzle has a central land (218) which controls the ink meniscus and avoids the ejected drop receiving a sideways kick from the nozzle wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
forming the nozzles of ink jet printheads, particularly drop-on-demand 
ink jet printheads. In particular the method involves forming nozzles after the 
nozzle plates are attached to the printhead into a generally conical 
shape tapered in the nozzle flow direction. The method employs a high 
energy beam, suitably, an UV ablating pulsed excimer laser incident on 
the exit face of the nozzle. Since the initial proposals for drop-on-demand ink jet printers, 
as for example, in US-A-3,946,398 (Kyser & Sears), it has been known 
to employ nozzles of a generally frusto-conical shape tapering towards 
the nozzle outlet. The geometry of the nozzles should be accurately 
made with regard to their location, exit area and direction of cone 
axis in the nozzle plate in order to ensure uniform quality of 
printing by ink drops ejected from them. A single nozzle plate 
typically incorporates between 50-5000 nozzles which apply monochrome 
ink or a number of independent ink colours. Accurate placement of the 
nozzles in a uniform pattern within and between colourways on the 
nozzle plate also controls printing quality. The geometrical shape of 
the cone is further chosen with particular regard to the dynamic 
acoustic impedances of the ink in the nozzle in the ejection cycle, to 
minimise the energy of drop ejection and at the same time damp the 
residual acoustic energy in the channel in preparation for a further 
operating cycle.  
 The inlet section of the nozzle is also matched as far as 
possible to the ink channel section of the actuator behind it in order 
to prevent entrapment of air bubbles behind the nozzle plate which may 
disrupt operation of the printer. It is further generally accepted 
that it is necessary for the ink to wet the nozzle bore but to be 
non-wetting to the material of the nozzle plate exit face. Accordingly, it is required to develop methods of nozzle 
manufacture whereby nozzles are formed with a well defined and 
precisely reproduced geometric shape and are arranged in defined 
locations within the nozzle plate with optical accuracy. A further 
requirement of the methods is that manufacture be continuous and 
rapid, capable of making several thousand printheads per day at 
extremely low cost. In patent application EP-A-0 309 146 it is proposed, inter alia, 
to form the nozzles in the nozzle plate of an ink jet printhead 
following attachment of the nozzle plate, by exposing the exit face of 
the nozzle plate via an apertured
