<ABSTRACT>
In a body electrode having a support layer (1) which comprises an electrode member (2) onto which an electrically conducting layer (4) is applied, and a connecting member into which an attachment of the metallic layer (4) merges, and an adhesive and conducting layer (11) which covers the free surface of the layer (4) and ensures contact with the skin, production of a connecting contact on the electrode member (2) is simplified in that the connecting member is a conducting member (3) which is at least a few centimetres long and not more than a few millimetres wide, onto which a connecting line (7) connected to the sensor (4) is imprinted, and in that the connecting line (7) is covered with an insulating layer (10) on that side which faces away from the support layer (1) and is thus insulated on all sides.

A body electrode comprising a carrier layer (1)
consisting of an electrode part (2), to which an

electrically conductive sensor (4) is applied, and a
conduction part (3) which serves as connecting part

and to which a connection line (7) connected to the
sensor (4) is applied, and comprising an adhesive and

conductive layer (11) which covers the free surface of
the sensor (4) and is provided for the skin contact,

characterized in that the conduction part (3) has a
minimum length of a few centimetres and a maximum

width of a few millimetres, that the conduction part
(3) is constructed from three layers, the connection

line (7) being covered with an insulating layer (10)
on the side facing away from the carrier layer (1) and

thus being insulated on all sides, and that the
dimensioning and flexibility of the conduction part

(3) are such that bending- and torsion moments active
at one end are not noticeably transferred to the

electrode part (2).
A body electrode according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the entire surface of the covering layer (10)

is connected to the carrier layer (1) on both sides of
the connection line (7).
A body electrode according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the covering layer (10) and/or

the carrier layer (1) is/are transparent.
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the covering layer (10) is

formed from the same material as the carrier layer
(1).
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
chara
cterised in that connection line (7) and sensor
(4) are produced in one piece. 
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that for the formation of a contact

surface (8) the covering layer (10) terminates at a
distance from the free end of the carrier layer (1)

and the connection line (7).
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the covering layer (10) extends

into the electrode part (2) and widens therein.
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the sensor (4) has the form of a

circular ring (5) with a plurality of radial,
centrally converging webs (6).
A body electrode according to Claim 7 and 8,
characterised in that the covering layer (10) extends

into the region of the outer edge of the circular ring
(5).
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the ratio of length to width of

the conduction part (3) is 
>
 50:1, preferably 
>
 90:1.
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the conduction part (3) has a

maximum width of 5 mm and a minimum length of 20 cm.
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the carrier layer (1) and/or the

covering layer (10) consist of plastics material.
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the carrier layer (1) is formed

from paper. 
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that the covering layer (10) consists

of an insulating lacquer.
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 14,
characterised in that the sensor (4) and the

connection line (7) are applied to the carrier layer
(1) by screen printing.
A body electrode according to Claim 15, characterised
in that the sensor (4) and the connection line (7)

consist of a conductive lacquer.
A body electrode according to Claim 16, characterised
in that the conductive lacquer contains silver and is

preferably chlorinated at its surface.
A body electrode according to one of Claims 1 to 17,
characterised in that it consists of X-ray-translucent

material.
