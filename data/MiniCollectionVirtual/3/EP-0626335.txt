<ABSTRACT>
The guide rail of an elevator driven by a 
linear motor also constitutes the secondary 

circuit of the linear motor. The 
guide rail of the elevator car or counterweight 

is made of a conducting metal 
and extends substantially through the 

whole length of the shaft. The guide rail 
(22) is provided with reinforcements 

(23), which can be connected together by 
means of fasteners (26) going through the 

rail. The reinforcements receive the 
thrust of the guides (30) of the car or 

counterweight. Alternatively, the guide 
rail is coated e.g. with teflon, in which 

case the coated portion receives the 
thrust of the sliding guides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a linear motor driven
elevator according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a guide
rail according to the preamble of claim 6.In recent times, linear motors have aroused great interest
as elevator drive motors. The driving power of the motor is
converted into linear motion in the elevator shaft without a
transmission, a rotating drive machinery or a gear system
changing the speed. In the solutions employed, the linear
motor has been placed in the counterweight or the elevator
car. The control unit of the elevator motor as well as the
power supply equipment can be placed completely in the
elevator shaft or in the elevator car and counterweight
moving in it.In elevator drive applications using a linear motor, the
stationary secondary circuit of the motor is normally
mounted in the elevator shaft, extending through its whole
length. The movable primary circuit of the motor is placed
in the counterweight or in the elevator car. In high-rise
buildings, the secondary circuit has to be very long,
constituting a considerable item of expenditure. To remedy
this disadvantage, numerous solutions aiming at improving
the perfomance of the magnetic circuit of the motor have
been suggested. Systems have also been proposed where the
secondary circuit or part of the secondary circuit of the
motor consists of the guide rails guiding the movement of
the elevator car and counterweight in the elevator shaft.Application publication DE 2 002 081 (B66B 11/04) presents a
solution in which the guide rails of the elevator car or
counterweight are utilized by generating a sinusoidal
magnetic field in them by means of inductance coils placed
in the counterweight or elevator car. The guide rails are
made of metal. The secondary circuit of the motor must have 
optimal electrical properties and, on the other hand, as it
acts as a guide rail, it has to be able to receive the
forces applied to it. The metals available do not have this
combination of properties, which is why the performance of
the elevator remains low.Patent publication US 5 062 501 presents a linear motor
driven elevator in which the counterweight guide rail is
coated with a conducting layer which forms the secondary
winding of the linear motor. The forces applied to the guide
rail are received by the rail body which is made of steel.
In this solution, two metals having different characteristics,
steel and aluminium, have to be joined together to
form a guide rail extending through the whole length of the
shaft, involving high expenses
