<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the invention a fine-line semiconductor device is 
fabricated by the steps of applying a layer of resist (11) to the surface of a 

semiconductor substrate (10), opening a line in the resist with negative sloping side 

walls, applying to the patterned structure a layer of material (16) which conforms to 
both horizontal and vertical surfaces including the negative sloping sidewalls, 

thereby reducing the width of the opened line; and etching away the horizontal 
portions of the conforming layer using the overhanging portion of the conforming 

layer as a mask. The result is an exposed line of semiconductor (19) having a width 
reduced from the original width by more than twice the thickness of the conforming 

layer. The invention is illustrated by the fabrication of a gallium arsenide MESFET 
transistor with a 0.4 micron gate length. Gate lengths so small as 0.1 micron have 

been made using this technique.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for fabricating fine-line semiconductor 
devices such as field effect transistors having submicron gate width. An improved 
transistor is also described. The goal of reducing minimum line widths in semiconductor device 
fabrication is well known. Finer lines in field effect transistors mean shorter gate 
widths, reduced carrier transit times, reduced propagation delays and higher 
operating frequencies. Considerable efforts have been expended to reduce minimum 
line widths below one micron. Technology developed to push the state of the art 
includes deep ultraviolet optical lithography, x-ray lithography and phase shift 
masking techniques. Each new reduction in linewidth has been obtained only by the 
use of increasingly expensive and elaborate technology. Moreover the currently 
preferred approach of electron beam lithography is slow. Accordingly, there is a 
need for a quick, inexpensive method for fabricating fine-line semiconductor 
devices. A fine-line semiconductor device is fabricated by the steps of applying a 
layer of resist to the surface of a semiconductor substrate, opening a line in the resist 
with negative sloping side walls, applying to the patterned structure a layer of 
material which conforms to both horizontal and vertical surfaces including the 
negative sloping sidewalls, thereby reducing the width of the opened line; and 
etching away the horizontal portions of the conforming layer using the overhanging 
portion of the conforming layer as a mask. The result is an exposed line of 
semiconductor having a width reduced from the original width by more than twice 
the thickness of the conforming layer. The invention is illustrated by the fabrication 
of a gallium arsenide MESFET transistor with a 0.4 micron gate length. Gate lengths 
so small as 0.1 micron have been made using this technique.  In the drawings: 
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the steps of the process for making 
a fine-line semiconductor device; FIGs. 2-5 illustrate schematic cross sections of a workpiece at various 
steps in the fabrication process of FIG. 1; FIG. 6 is a schematic cross section of a workpiece for making a 
MESFET; and FIG. 7 is a schematic cross section of a MESFET having a fine-line gate 
electrode fabricated in accordance with the method of FIG. 1. Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the steps 
of a preferred process for making fine-line semiconductor devices. As shown in 
block A, the first step is to apply to a semiconductor
