<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition is provided which can be 
topically applied to the outer ocular area for the purpose 

of inhibiting injury to the corneal epithelium. The 
composition may take the form of eye drops or eye ointment 

which contain certain amount of glucose as an active 
ingredient. The composition can also contain conventional 

ingredients of eye drops or eye ointment such as carriers, 
buffering agents etc. as well as certain preservatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical 
composition for ophthalmic topical administration to the 
outer ocular area. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to such a composition usable to inhibit injury to 
the corneal epithelium. The cornea is a transparent tissue forming the outer, 
frontal coat of the eyeball. It allows light from outside 
to enter the interior of the eyeball, with a certain amount 
of refraction occurring when the light pass through the 
cornea. The cornea is composed, from its outermost side, of 
an epithelial cell layer (epithelium), Bowman's membrane, 
corneal stroma, Descemet's membrane, and an endothelial 
cell layer. Because located in the outermost, frontal 
surface, the epithelium is easily injured by impinging 
foreign bodies or wearing of a contact lens. In particular, 
when wearing a contact lens, the epithelium is quite likely 
to be injured since, in addition to the mechanical stress 
exerted by the contact lens, there may occur metabolic 
malfunction caused by oxygen defect due to the lowered 
oxygen partial tension on the surface of the cornea 
underlying the contact lens. Metabolic malfunction of the 
epithelium leads to epithelial edema with increasing number  
 
of microcysts and fluorescein-stainable opaque spots, and, 
eventually, to corneal ulcer. Therefore, a medicament which can be topically applied 
to inhibit injury to the corneal epithelium due to foreign 
bodies or contact lenses would be of use. At present, 
however, there are no current medicaments shown to have 
such an effect to a satisfactory degree. Upon this background, the present inventors have found 
that glucose, when topically applied to the outer ocular 
area (i.e. the cornea and conjunctiva), inhibits injury to 
the corneal epithelium. Therefore, in one aspect, it is the object of the 
present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition 
to be topically applied to the outer ocular area (i.e., to 
the front surface of the cornea or into the conjunctival 
sac) of mammals (e.g., humans, rabbits, dogs, cats, 
bovines, horses, monkeys, etc.) which composition contains 
glucose as the active ingredient for inhibiting injury to 
the corneal epithelium. The composition can take the form of 
eye drops (ophthalmic solutions or suspensions), eye 
ointment or the like. In another aspect, it is the object of the present 
invention to provide a method of inhibiting injury to the 
corneal epithelium, the method performed by topically  
 
administering a glucose-containing
