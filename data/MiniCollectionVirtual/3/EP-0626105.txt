<DESCRIPTION>
DescriptionA device for making electrical connections in a multiple connectorThe invention relates to a device for making electrical connections in a multiple connector especially for making connections between multi-conductor cables or bundles of cables, for example of main cable and /or branch networks, for example of a telecommunications network.A device for making electrical connections in a multiple connector between multiple conductor flat cables is described in EP-B-0149911. This describes means for holding upper and lower parts of the connector, and a pressing beam for pressing those parts together. The lower part of the multiple connector is placed in a holder which is adjustable in width (to accommodate different sized connectors) and, after insertion of the cable conductors to be contacted, the upper part is placed on top, (lateral guides being present to position the upper part), and subsequently the upper part is pressed into the lower part by means of a hydraulic ram in such a manner that the connection is produced and the cable conductors are cut. The multiple connector described is of the cutting/clamping type. It is an insulation displacement connector (IDC). The multiple connector of the present invention is preferably also of the cutting/ clamping type, preferably an IDC connector.A device with similar purpose, but having a separating comb and a clamping helix for organising and locating fixedly the individual cable conductors to be joined on the lower connector part, is known from DE-B- 2024537 and from its equivalent US patent, US-A-3708779. In these specification, the device is supported on the ends of the main cables themselves. Again pressing of the upper part of the connector against the lower part is effected by a pressing beam that can be operated by hydraulic double cylinders.A disadvantage common to both the known solutions is that they are technically comparatively complicated and constructionaliy complicated, and the pneumatic or hydraulic pressing cylinders are comparatively heavy, so that, 

overall, simple handling of such devices is possible only if they can be fastened, for example, to heavy and compartively rigid main cables.An object of the present invention is to provide a solution with which the connection to multiple connectors can be achieved for conductors of all cable types, regardless of the size and /or rigidity of the cables, e.g. the device cable can be used not only in main cable networks but also in branch networks. To these ends the device of the
