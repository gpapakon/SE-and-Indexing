<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new process for manufacturing a ceramic-metal substrate which consists of at least one ceramic layer (2) and of at least two metal layers (3, 4) which are in each case provided on top of the ceramic layer (2), and which substrate has at least one electrical through-conductive region (5) on which the metal layers (3, 4) are electrically connected to one another in the region of an opening or a window (6) in the at least one ceramic layer (2) by means of a metal link (7), in the case of which (process) metal foils or platelets (3', 4') (whose surfaces are formed by chemical bonding of the metal with a reactive gas) are mounted by means of the direct bonding process on the top of the at least one ceramic layer (2) in order to form the metal layers (3, 4), and in the case of which (process) a metal which forms the link (7) is introduced into the at least one opening or into the at least one window (6) in order to manufacture the through-plated region (5), via which metal the metal layers (3, 4) are electrically connected to one another by means of the direct bonding process.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the manufacture of a ceramic/metal substrate 
which comprises at least a single ceramic layer (2) and at 

least two metal layers (3, 4) provided on each surface side 
of the ceramic layer (2) and exhibits at least one electric 

through connection (5), to which the metal layers (3, 4) 
are electrically connected together in the area of an 

opening or a window (6) in the at least single ceramic 
layer (2) via a metal bridge (7), in which (process) metal 

foils or blanks (3', 4'), whose surfaces are formed by a 
chemical bond between the metal and a reactive gas, are 

fixed using the direct bonding process to the surface sides 

of the at least single ceramic layer (2) to form the metal 
layers (3, 4), and in which (process), in order to form the 

through connection (5), a metal forming the bridge (7), is 
inserted into the at least single opening or into the at 

least single window (6), via which bridge the metal layers 
(3, 4) are electrically connected together using the direct 

bonding process, characterised in that a metal body (8, 8') 
is inserted into the at least single opening (6), which 

fills it completely or virtually completely, and which is 
also provided on its surface with a layer from the chemical 

bond of the metal and the reactive gas. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that when 
fixing at least one metal foil or blank (3', 4'), 

connection of the metal body (8, 8') with at least one of 
the two metal layers (3, 4) takes place at the same time. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a 
metal foil or blank (3') forming an initial metal layer (3) 

is fixed on one surface side of the ceramic layer (2), that 
subsequently the at least single metal body (8, 8') is 

inserted into the at least single window or into the at  
 

least single opening (6) from the other surface side of the 
ceramic layer (2), that then at least a single metal foil 

or blank (4') forming the second metal layer (4) is laid on 
this other surface side of the ceramic layer (2), and that 

then this second metal foil or blank (4') is bonded to the 
ceramic layer (2) and at the same time the metal body (8, 

8') is bonded to the metal layers (3, 4) on both surface 
sides of the ceramic layer (2), in a further direct bonding 

process. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 3, characterised in 
that a metal body (8, 8') is inserted into each window (6) 

of several openings or windows (6) in the ceramic layer (2) 
to form several through connections (5), preferably by 

distributing these metal bodies over the openings (6) by 
means of a shaking or vibration technique and/or the use of 

distribution or stripping elements. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 4, characterised in 
that the metal is copper and/or that the reactive gas is 

oxygen. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 5, characterised in 
that the metal bodies (8, 8') are designed as round blanks, 

cuboid or as balls. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 6, characterised in 
that the dimensions of the metal bodies (8, 8') are chosen 

in such a way that the height of the metal bodies (8, 8') 
is the same or slightly larger than the thickness of the 

ceramic layer (2) . 
Method according to one of claims 1 - 7, characterised in 
that the ceramic layer (2) is an aluminium oxide ceramic or 

an aluminium nitride ceramic, which is pre-oxidised on its 
surface sides.  

 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 8, characterised in 
that the metal body (8, 8') is permanently deformed before 

and/or after insertion in a window (6), to a dimension 
which corresponds to the thickness of the ceramic layer 

(2). 
Ceramic/metal substrate with at least one through 
connection, characterised by the fact that it is 

manufactured with at least one solid through connection 
using the process according to one of claims 1 to 9.
