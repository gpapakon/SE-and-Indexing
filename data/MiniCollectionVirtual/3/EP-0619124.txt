<ABSTRACT>
The microwave antenna (2) which is fed from the outside via a connection line (1) is designed as a folded dipole (3) which is insulated and wound in the form of a double helix (4) over an essentially cylindrical, conducting support body (6) which can also be formed directly by the terminal region (8) of the shielding (9) of a coaxial cable (7) serving as connection line (1). By displacing the feed point of the connection line (1) out of the centre of the double helix (4) the input resistance of the microwave antenna (2) can be easily adapted to the characteristic impedance of the connection line (1). Overall, this results in a stable resonance of the microwave antenna (2) and holds back radiation of the connection line (1).
