<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet head for a drop on-demand type ink jet printer. The driving electrodes can be easily and reliably connected to 
the external electrodes. Further, rotational action of the piezoelectric element during the driving is suppressed. Between the driving 

electrodes having insulating film and the external electrodes, there is provided an electrical connection material containing 
conductive grains which are harder than the insulating film and has a particle diameter larger than the thickness of the film. Recesses 

are provided in the bottoms of the grooves of the piezoelectric elements which function as ink chambers and pressure 
chambers. These recesses are formed by line segments connected at least by two line segments or line segments connected by one 

curved line. Part of the line segments which bring about the rotation of the piezoelectric elements is transformed into the component 
which establishes a shearing mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet head
of a drop-on-demand (DOD) type, and, more
specifically, relates to an ink jet head of a
piezoelectric type.It is ink jet printers of non-impact printers
expanding the market that have a simple principle and
are suitable also for color printing. It can be said
that an ink jet printer of a so-called DOD type
jetting ink drops only on formation of dots is the
leading one of them.As typical examples of a DOD type can be
mentioned a kaiser type disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication No. 12138/1978 and a thermal jet type
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No.
59914/1986.Both have a very difficult problem: the former is
hard to miniaturize, and in the latter, ink is burned
due to high heat given to ink.As forms dissolving the above defects
simultaneously are proposed an expanding mode type
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
159358/1984 (equivalent to US-A-4536097) and a shearing mode type disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 252750/1988
using a chip of a piezoelectric material.A shearing mode type will be described briefly as
the explanation of conventional examples according to
sectional views of Fig. 14 and Fig. 15.First of all, a pressure chamber 1a is 
constituted by forming a slot on a piezoelectric base
1 and covering it with a flat-plate-like upper lid 2.
A driving electrode 4 is provided on the inner wall of
said slot 1 and voltage is applied onto a barrier 1c,
a part of the above piezoelectric base 1 to deform
said barrier 1c.If the polarization of the piezoelectric base 1
is left in the direction to the upper lid 2 from said
base, shearing deformation shown with a broken line
occurs when an electric field by voltage is in the
direction of an arrow.Here, the state of the barrier after deformation
is shown exaggeratively with a view to showing the
deformation of the barrier clearly.The volume of the pressure chamber 1a is reduced
by said deformation and ink supplied in the inside is
pressurized, which jets ink drops from a nozzle hole
provided in correspondence to said pressure chamber
and performs printing.Generally, an electroconductive aqueous ink is
used in an ink jet printer of a DOD type.Because of it, in a shearing mode type with no
insulating film formed shown in Fig. 15, the driving
electrode 4 and ink come into contact with each other
directly to cause the short circuit of adjacent
driving electrodes or the electrolysis of ink itself,
and hence, it is necessary to apply an insulating film
6 between
