<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing tunnel (tunnel-effect) sensors, in which a sharp edge (2) consisting of the silicon of the substrate (1) is produced on a silicon substrate (1) having electrically conducting doped regions (4) by oxidation of the silicon with the use of a nitride mask on the surface, and, with the use of the planarised oxide layer (5) produced during the oxidation process, a polysilicon bar (3), for example, which is anchored on the substrate (1) is applied over the sharp edge (2) as the opposite electrode for utilisation of the tunnel effect and is doped electrically conductingly and the oxide layer (5) is subsequently removed.

Process for producing tunnelling-effect sensors 
on a silicon substrate (1) which is provided with a 

structure, produced by doping, of electrical conductors 
(4), in which a silicon spike (2) is produced on this 

substrate (1), 

a thin layer on the surface of the substrate (1) being 
oxidized to form a pad oxide layer (6) in a first step, 

a mask (7) of a material which prevents the penetration 
of oxygen being produced in a second step, 
by using this mask (7), a layer on the surface of the 
substrate (1) being oxidized to form an oxide layer (8) 

in a third step, so that the spike (2) is formed under 
the mask (7), 
the mask (7) being removed in a fourth step, 
a silicon layer (3), from which a counter-electrode (4) 
is structured, being applied in a fifth step to a planar 

surface, covering the spike, of the oxide layer (8), and 
this oxide layer (8) being removed in a sixth step. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which, between 
the first step and the second step, 


a first mask (9) of a material which prevents the penetration 
of oxygen is applied to this pad oxide layer (6) 

and structured, in a first further step, 
using this first mask (9), a layer on the surface of the 
substrate (1) is then oxidized in a second further step 

to form a first oxide layer (10), 
this first oxide layer (10) is then isotropically removed 
almost completely, but so that the first mask (9) 

remains, in a third further step, 
a further pad oxide layer (11) is then produced in a  
 

fourth further step, and 
the second step is then carried out by isotropically 
applying, over the entire surface, a layer (13) of a 

material which prevents the penetration of oxygen, and 
structuring it. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which, between 
the second step and the third step, this pad oxide layer 

(6) and a layer-like portion on the surface of the 
substrate (1) are removed laterally with respect to this 

mask (7). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in 
which, after the fourth step, this oxide layer (8) is 

planarized. 
Process according to Claim 4, in which, as the 
fifth step, a polysilicon layer is applied in such a way, 

and removed to such an extent, that a bar (3) anchored on 
the silicon of the substrate (1) remains above the 

spike (2).
