<DESCRIPTION>
Pressurized paints, more commonly referred to as aerosol 
paints, have traditionally been high in volatile organic content 
(VOC) due to both the resin systems used in the paint and the 
propellant systems used to expel the resin from the container. 
Newer VOC regulations throughout the United States of America and 
the world have forced manufacturers to develop alternative aerosol 
paint formulations which have lower VOC's. In particular, the Bay 
Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD-California), in 1990 
and 1991, adopted stringent regulations regarding the allowable 
levels of volatile organic content in aerosol paints and coatings. 
For non-flat (gloss) paint products, the acceptable VOC content, 
expressed as a percent of volatile organic content by weight of 
product is 65%. Some manufacturers, such as Page (U.S Patent 4,384,661) have 
attempted to formulate acceptable aerosol coating products using 
water as an ingredient. The present invention represents a major 
development in aerosol paint formulation. The present invention 
uses a non-aqueous dispersion as a principal resin in an aerosol 
paint formulation. The present invention results in a coating 
composition which is VOC compliant (using the BAAQMD standards), 
has good in-can stability and better performance properties than 
aqueous-based aerosol compositions. The present invention solves 
one of the problems associated with other attempts to formulate 
lower VOC aerosol products; namely, paint viscosity so high that  
 
the products will not spray in an acceptable fashion. Non-aqueous dispersions (NAD's) are well known in the non-aerosol 
coatings art and typically consist of dispersions of 
addition polymers in a relatively non-polar non-aqueous liquid 
containing a steric stabilzing agent having dual affinity to both 
the dispersing and the dispersed media. For example, U.S. Patent 
3,198,759 teaches diapersions of addition polymers in a hydrocarbon 
medium. The hydrocarbon medium contains one or more aliphatic 
hydrocarbons containing dissolved therein an alkyd formed by either 
the direct esterification of a drying oil fatty acid with a 
dicarboxylic acid and a polyhydric alcohol or the indirect 
esterification of a drying oil by first alcoholization with a 
polyhydric alcohol and second esterification with a polybasic acid. 
European Patent Application 0 310 331 A2 teaches a non-aqueous 
dispersion of a soluble low molecular weight non-alkyd polymer 
which is attached or adsorbed onto a second non-soluble alkyd-free 
polymer
