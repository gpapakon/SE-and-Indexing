<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dental soft relining
material for use in a method of dental treatment and to a method
of repairing a denture. The invention further relates
to a denture provided with a layer of the soft relining
material.Patients who need a denture and, particularly, a full
denture, in many cases, are aged persons, and their
alveolar ridges must bear an increased occlusion force per
a unit area since the bone has generally been resorbed to
a conspicuous degree. The mucosa of alveolar ridge becomes
thin due to senile atrophy, and the occlusal stress or
masticatory pressure is not softened but is directly
transmitted to the alveolar bone. Moreover, a thin mucosa
disposed between a hard resin denture base and the hard
alveolar bone is tightened and gets hurt after every
occlusion, and begins to feel pain.In such a serious case, the resin denture base molded
by using a methyl methacrylate resin that is usually used
is not sufficient for stably maintaining the mastication
and supporting the adhesion of the denture. That is, it
is necessary to reline the mucosa surface of the resin
denture base with a soft dental relining material to
compensate the lost viscoelasticity of the mucosa of the
residual alveolar ridge, in order to impart cushioning
property that softens the occlusal stress. That is, the
object of relining with a soft material is to overcome
various troubles that develop when the thin mucosa is
compressed by the hard denture base.Dental soft relining materials used, so far, for the 
clinic include a (meth)acrylic acid ester polymer, a
fluorine-containing resin, a polyolefin type resin, a
silicone rubber, and the like. For temporary
applications, furthermore, there is used a denture
adhesive.However, the soft material such as the (meth)acrylic
acid polymer or the like lacks chemical stability in the
oral cavity, become hard and brittle within several
months, and are not usable for extended periods of time.
The fluorine type relining material lacks viscoelasticity
from which sufficient cushioning effect cannot be
expected. The polyolefin type relining material has many
problems from a practical point of view. That is, it may
deform the resin denture base because the preparation
temperature is high, and it requires a plurality of
adhesives and a special heating device, involving a
cumbersome operation. The silicone rubber-type relining
material is relatively stable but is not sufficient in
regard to durability, especially straining, and
operability, especially trimming. In
