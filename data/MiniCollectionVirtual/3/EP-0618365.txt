A positive-displacement machine comprising a cylindrical piston 
(1) which has an axis Δ
p
, which is rotary, and which is situated in 
a cylindrical casing (2) which has an axis Δ
c
, said machine being 
characterized in that, in a plane perpendicular to its axis Δ
p
, said 
piston has a cross-section that is hypertrochoidal in geometrical 

shape and that has S
p
 axes of symmetry, said casing delimiting a 
hollow volume (3) whose cross-section in a plane perpendicular to its 

axis Δ
c
 is hypertrochoidal in geometrical shape and has S
c
 axes of 
symmetry, S
p
 and S
c
 differing from each other by unity, the axes Δ
p
 
and Δ
c
 being parallel and separated by a distance E, said piston (1) 
being mounted to rotate freely about its axis Δ
p
, on a crank pin (4) 
that has an axis Δ
p
, and that is secured to a shaft (7) having an 
axis Δ
c
 and supported by said casing (2), said shaft (7) being 
designed to be rotated about its axis Δ
c
 by drive means, the piston 
and the casing delimiting at least three chambers (A, B, C) between 

them, and the casing including at least one suction inlet (20) and 
one delivery outlet (22), and in that the rotation of the piston (1) 

in its orbital motion about the axis Δ
c
 of the casing (2) is created 
by magnetic repulsion forces (10, 11, 12, 13) by means of permanent 

magnets situated firstly on or in the vicinity of the surface of the 
piston, and secondly on or in the vicinity of the inside surface of 

said casing. 
A positive-displacement machine comprising a cylindrical piston 
(1) which has an axis Δ
p
, and which is situated in a cylindrical 
casing (2) which has an axis Δ
c
. said machine being characterized in 
that, in a plane perpendicular to its axis Δ
p
, said piston has a 
cross-section that is hypertrochoidal in geometrical shape and that 

has S
p
 axes of symmetry, said casing (2) delimiting a hollow volume 
(3) whose cross-section in a plane perpendicular to its axis Δ
c

, and that is secured to a shaft (7) having an 
axis Δ
p
 and supported by bearings (8, 9) in a box (24A, 24B)  
 

enclosing said casing, said box having a circularly cylindrical 
recess (25) that has an axis Δ
p
 and that is large enough to enable 
the crank pin (4) to rotate freely about the axis Δ
p
 of said shaft 
(7) and to enable said casing (2) to rotate in orbital motion about 

the axis Δ
p
, said casing (2) being open over a side face, and said 
piston being coupled to said box at said side face with 
no freedom of 
movement, said shaft (7) being designed to be rotated about its axis 

Δ
p
 by drive means, the rotation of the casing in its orbital motion 
about the axis Δ
p
 of the piston (1) being created by magnetic 
repulsion forces by means of permanent magnets (10, 11) situated 

firstly on or in the vicinity of the surface of the piston, and 
secondly on or in the vicinity of the inside surface of said casing, 

the piston and the casing delimiting at least three chambers (A, B, 
C) between them, a side face (24B) of said box including at least one 

suction inlet (20) and one delivery outlet (22) communicating with 
each other in at least one of said chambers. 
A positive-displacement machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said permanent magnets are axially polarized. 
A positive-displacement machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said permanent magnets are radially polarized. 
A positive-displacement machine according to any one of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that said permanent magnets comprise a 

plurality of magnets (10) on the piston and a plurality of magnets 
(11) on the inside surface of the casing. 
A positive-displacement machine according to any one of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that said piston carries a magnetic band (12) 

and in that said casing carries a magnetic band (13).
