<ABSTRACT>
A radial-flow compressor having a flow-stabilising casing comprises a rotor (2) which is rotatably mounted about a machine shaft (7) and has a hub (9) on whose perimeter a multiplicity of rotor blades (3) are arranged; a compressor casing (4) which encloses the rotor and which, with its inner casing profile (4a), matches the outer profile of the rotor blades (3) and, together with the hub (9), forms a flow duct which runs between an axial inlet (10) and a radial outlet (11); and, in the entry zone of the flow duct, a multiplicity of oblong stabiliser slots (5) which run in the flow direction, project from the inner casing profile (4a) into the casing (4) and are arranged so as to be distributed over the inner circumference of the casing (4). In order to extend the stable operating range towards smaller volume flows, the stabiliser slots (7) are arranged in such a way, with respect to the rotor blades (3), that their front end facing the axial inlet (10) is situated at a predetermined distance downstream from the leading blade edge (6).

Centrifugal compressor with a flow-stabilizing 
casing, including 


(a) an impeller (2) rotatably supported about a machine 
axis (7) and having a hub (9) with a plurality of 

impeller vanes (3) on its periphery; 
(b) a compressor casing (4), which encloses the impeller, 
whose inner casing contour (4a) is matched to 

the outer contour of the impeller vanes (3) and, 
together with the hub (9), forms a flow duct extending 

between an axial inlet (10) and a radial outlet 
(11); and 
(c) a plurality of elongated stabilizer slots (5), which 
extend in the flow direction in the inlet region of 

the flow duct, penetrate from the inner casing 
contour (4a) into the casing (4) and are distributed 

over the inner periphery of the casing (4); 
 
characterized in that 


(d) the stabilizer slots (5) are arranged relative to 
the impeller vanes (3) in such a way that their 

front end facing toward the axial inlet (10) is 
located at a predetermined distance downstream of 

the vane leading edge (6). 
Centrifugal compressor according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the rear end of the stabilizer 

slots (5) is located in the region of the beginning of 
the deflection from the axial inlet flow to the radial 

outlet flow. 
Centrifugal compressor according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the impeller vanes (3) include main 

vanes (3a) extending from the axial inlet (10) to the 
radial outlet (11) and shorter intermediate vanes (3b) 

located between the main vanes and only beginning after 
the axial inlet (10), and in that the rear end of the 

stabilizer slots (5) is located in the region where the 
intermediate vanes (3b) begin. 
Centrifugal compressor according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the stabilizer slots (5) 

respectively have a bottom (5b) extending straight in the  
 

flow direction, which bottom is oriented approximately 
tangentially to the adjacent outer contour of the impeller 

vanes (3). 
Centrifugal compressor according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the stabilizer slots (5) are each 

bounded at the rear end by a rear wall (5c) which extends 
flatter than the local normal to the inner casing contour 

(4a) and, together with this normal, encloses an acute 
angle (Î³). 
Centrifugal compressor according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the rear wall (5c) respectively 

merges with continuous tangent into the bottom (5b). 
Centrifugal compressor according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that each stabilizer slot (5) 

has a bottom (5b) extending straight in the flow direction, 
which bottom runs out in a wedge shape into the 

inner casing contour (4a) at the rear end of the slot. 
Centrifugal compressor according to one of Claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the stabilizer slots (5) 

are each bounded at their front end by a front wall (5a) 
which merges with continuous tangent into a bottom (5b) 

extending straight in the flow direction. 
Centrifugal compressor according to one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that the stabilizer slots (5) 

are arranged so that they are inclined in the direction 
of rotation of the impeller (2).
