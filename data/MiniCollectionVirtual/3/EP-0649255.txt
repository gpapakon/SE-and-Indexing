<ABSTRACT>
M/N-fold high-speed reproduction is achieved in a video signal reproducing 
apparatus by displaying continued N frames at intervals of M frames. The order of 

the reproduced frames becomes 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, M, M + 1, M + 2, ..., M + N - 1, 
2M, 2M + 1, 2M + 2, ..., 2M + N - 1, 3M, 3M + 1, 3M + 2, ..., 3M + N - 1, ...... 

In this way, good continuity of picture images between frames, when high-speed 
reproduction is performed in the video signal reproducing apparatus, can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video signal reproducing apparatus. More particularly,
but not exclusively, the invention relates to apparatus for reproducing a video signal
at high speed from a storage medium such as a video disk, a hard disk, and a
semiconductor memory permitting random access.In a video disk system, for example a laser disk system, one frame of a video
signal is recorded in each rotation of the disk in the case of CAV disks and one to
three frames of video signal are recorded in each rotation of the disk in the case of
CLV disks. As an example of this art, see US Patent No. US-A-5 159 488.In performing A-fold (A is an integer equal to 2 or above) high-speed
reproduction in such a video disk system, the practice is successively to display one
frame at intervals of A frames as shown in FIGs. 14(a) and 14(b) of the accompanying
drawings. More specifically, such an operation is repeated that, after one frame has
been read from a video disk, the read head is moved to the track located A frames
rearward during, generally, a vertical blanking period, and the next video signal is read
therefrom. There has, however, been a problem with such a
reproducing system that it becomes difficult to grasp
the content of the picture image when the reproducing
speed becomes very high. For example, when 100-fold
speed reproduction (A = 100 in FIGs. 14(a) and 14(b)) is
performed, in succession of display of one frame, the
other frame 100 frames rearward is displayed.
Therefore, continuity of picture images between the
frames becomes little and it becomes difficult to grasp
the content.Further, when it is attempted to search a
desired picture image by performing a high-speed search
and thereafter set a still mode or normal reproduction
mode to obtain a desired picture image, there has been a
problem that the track where the desired picture image
is recorded is passed by and, thus, an accurate search
is difficult to achieve.Further, when a video signal in the track
located A frames rearward cannot be read within a
vertical blanking period, for example in the case of a
CLV disk of which the reproducing speed is high, it
becomes necessary to repeat reading the video signal of
the same frame from the frame memory for a B-frame
period as shown in FIGs. 15(a) and 15(b) and display the 
same until the video signal in the track located A frames rearward is read.
Then, continuity of picture images between the frames becomes worse and
grasping the content becomes more difficult.The abstract to JP-A-62 110376 discloses a
