<ABSTRACT>
In a color picture tube apparatus having a first 
auxiliary deflecting means (GD1, GD2) for deflecting a 

single electron beam, emitted from a cathode (K), in a 
direction to separate from the tube axis (Z) in synchronism 

with switching among a plurality of video signals 
supplied to an electron gun, and splitting the single 

electron beam substantially into a plurality of beam 
segments, and a second auxiliary deflecting means, 

disposed between the first auxiliary deflecting means 
(GD1, GD2) and a main deflecting unit, for deflecting 

the plurality of beam segments in a direction to come 
close to the tube axis, the first auxiliary deflecting 

means (GD1, GD2) is constituted by an electrostatic 
deflecting lens provided to an accelerating electrode 

system between a control electrode (G1) and a focusing 
electrode (G4) of the electron gun, and the second 

auxiliary deflecting means is constituted by a main 
electron lens (ML) of the electron gun for finally 

focusing the electron beam segments on a phosphor 
screen. Accordingly, the entire length of the picture 

tube can be shortened, and the auxiliary deflecting 
power can be reduced as well as the manufacturing cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color picture
tube apparatus and, more particularly, to a color
picture tube apparatus for displaying an image by time-dividing
a single electron beam substantially into a
plurality of beams.Generally, a color picture tube apparatus
incorporates an electron gun assembly for emitting three
electron beams. The three electron beams emitted from
the electron gun assembly are deflected by a magnetic
field generated by a deflecting unit and scan a phosphor
screen opposing the electron gun assembly through a
shadow mask in the horizontal and vertical directions,
thereby displaying a color image on the screen.In contrast to this color picture tube apparatus,
Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 61-263030
discloses a color picture tube apparatus in which a
single electron beam is emitted from a cathode and is
time-divided substantially into three electron beams,
thereby displaying an image.More specifically, as shown in FIG. 1, this color
picture tube apparatus has an electron gun comprising
one cathode K for emitting a single electron beam 1,
first, second, third, fourth, and fifth grids (only a
fourth grid G4 is shown in FIG. 1) which are arranged
between the cathode K and a phosphor screen 2 and
control, accelerate, and focus the electron beam or 
electron beam segment(s) emitted from the cathode K,
and a convergence electrode C. In this apparatus, the
fourth grid G4 is constituted by two electrodes opposing
each other as the first auxiliary deflecting means.
The single electron beam 1 from the cathode K is
electrostatically deflected by the first auxiliary
deflecting means in three steps in a direction to
separate from a tube axis Z, so that it is split into
three beam segments. The convergence electrode C is
constituted by a pair of central electrodes C1 serving
as the second auxiliary deflecting means and a pair of
two side electrodes C2 arranged on the two sides of the
central electrodes C1. Each electron beam segment
deflected by the first auxiliary deflecting means in the
direction to separate from the tube axis is
electrostatically deflected by the convergence electrode
C in a direction to come close to the tube axis Z.Referring to FIG. 1, reference numeral 5 denotes a
main deflecting unit for deflecting the three beam
segments; 6, a deflection center plane of the main
deflecting unit 5; 7, a shadow mask; and 8, a three-color
video signal switch for switching among red,
green, and blue video signals.According to this color picture tube apparatus,
since the gap among
