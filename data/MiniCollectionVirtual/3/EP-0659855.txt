<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water-based coating 
composition suited for surface treatment of the metal sheets 
or plates to be used in building materials, household 
electric appliances, automobiles and the like. More 
particularly, it relates to a water-based coating composition 
for surface treatment of the steel or metal coated steel which 
composition can form, upon short period baking at low 
temperatures, coating films firmly adhering to the steel or 
metal coated steel and excellent in corrosion resistance, 
water resistance and weld ability, with a high degree of 
hardening and which composition has electric conductivity 
suitable for electrodeposition coating and is capable of 
providing lubricating ability in processing and thus 
preventing powdering during processing. Metal sheets or plates, for example, cold rolled steel, 
galvanized steel, electrogalvanized steel, zinc alloy coated 
steel made by hot dip galvanizing or electrogalvanizing, 
aluminized steel are widely used in building materials, 
household electric appliances, automobiles and the like. 
Metal sheets or plates mentioned above are reffered to as 
"steel or metal coated steel" in this specification. Generally, 
these steel or metal coated steel are subjected, after forming 
or shaping processing, to surface treatment for preparation 
for coating and, before assembling, to coating. In the above-mentioned step of forming or shaping, a 
lubricant such as press oil is applied to the steel or metal 
coated steel surface to improve the processability. However, 
when such a lubricant is used, a step of removing the 
lubricant, i.e. degreasing, is inevitably required after  
 
press processing but before surface treatment or coating. 
This means an economical disadvantage. Moreover, there are 
other problems, for example the lubricant scatters during 
processing and thus deteriorates the working environment. Therefore, surface-treated steel or metal coated steel 
having a coating film showing lubricating and rust inhibiting 
functions as formed on the steel plate surface without using 
any lubricant have been proposed in recent years for 
resources saving, cost reduction, working environment 
improvement and other purposes. Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-5-39458 discloses a 
technology for improving the press formability, among others, 
by forming a resin coating film consisting of a specific 
polyethylene wax on the steel plate surface. Japanese Kokai 
Publication Hei-1-301332 discloses a technology for attaining 
formability
