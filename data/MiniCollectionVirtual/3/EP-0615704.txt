<ABSTRACT>
A corrective foot insole for sufferers of an uncompensated 
forefoot varus, more commonly known as flexible flat foot. The 

corrective insole has a forefoot and a midfoot portion. The 
forefoot portion of the insole provides a lift for the two interior 

toes a distance back to, but not including the heel of the foot. 
The midfoot portion provides an additional lift to the metatarsal 

by use of a support arch which is located on top of the forefoot 
portion. The corrective foot insole allows the midfoot to rotate 

into supination. The entire first metatarsal and two interior toes 
are lifted into a position to compensate for the forefoot varus, 

and this insole also maintains the normal alignment position, 
motion and function of the entire foot during use of the corrective 

foot insole while maintaining the heel of the foot in its normal 
position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the correction of the human foot 
disorder of uncompensated forefoot varus, more commonly known as 
flexible flat foot. The foot acts as a shock absorber and as a rigid lever for 
toeing off. In the normal condition when the foot hits the ground, 
the foot is in pronation when the heel strikes. When the heel 
strikes the ground, the foot will shiver as it absorbs the shock. 
The weight bearing then transfers from the heel along the lateral 
border of the foot until it reaches the fifth metatarsal phalangeal 
joint or the ball of the foot. Then the weight bearing transfers 
across the ball of the foot to the great toe. Because the forefoot of a person with flexible flat foot is 
uncompensated, (the first metatarsal remains elevated off the 
ground), the forefoot cannot descend to the ground without 
excessively pronating the foot. In other words, a person will have 
to rock their foot to the inside in order to get the great toe down 
on the ground, and in doing so their foot never achieves the rigid 
status achieved by a supinated foot or a normal foot. In the supinated or normal foot, the first metatarsal is 
always on the ground and the action occurs in the mid-tarsal joint. 
The mid-tarsal joint rotates slightly and then it locks allowing 
a person to toe off on the great toe. A person with a pronated  
 
foot cannot do this because he cannot put his first metatarsal on 
the ground unless he rolls his ankle to the inside. This invention 
allows a person with a flexible flat foot to toe off on the great 
toe without rolling his ankle to the inside. The concept of correcting human foot disorders are discussed 
in patented art and are shown in various devices. For example, U.S. Patent No. 2,616,190, Darby, entitled 
"Walking Angle Corrective Footwear", issued November 4, 1952. This 
patent shows a device for correction of human foot and leg 
disorders arising from incorrect weight bearing on the feet. Darby 
attempts to accomplish this by elevating the medial side of the 
shoe with an elevated outer fore-sole. Darby would not work for 
a person who has a flexible flat foot, because with a flexible flat 
foot, the heel stays in a fairly normal position. The abnormal 
anatomy occurs at the talus and navicular joint (talo-navicular 
joint) and in the calcaneus and cuboid joint (calcanco-cuboid 
joint), which are the two joints which make up the mid-tarsal 
joint. The difference between the type of problem that Darby is 
correcting and that which the present invention is correcting

<CLAIMS>
A corrective foot insole (3) in combination with 
footwear having a predetermined length and width, and 

forefoot, midfoot, and heel portions, characterised by: 

a raised forefoot portion (1) of uniform thickness 
extending approximately half the width of the footwear such 

that it extends under the two medial toes, the forefoot 
portion extending from the front of the footwear to a 

distance less than the length of the footwear, such that it 
terminates in front of the heel portion of the footwear, and 

being substantially the same width throughout its length as 
said portion under the two medial toes of the wearer; and 
a midfoot portion (2) being of substantially elliptical 
shape for supporting the metatarsal of the wearer and said 

midfoot portion of said insole being attached to the upper 
face of said raised forefoot portion of said insole and 

extending from the front of said midfoot portion of said 
footwear to a distance less than the length of the footwear 

such that it terminates in front of the heel portion. 
A corrective foot insole as recited in claim 1, 
wherein said insole is removable.
