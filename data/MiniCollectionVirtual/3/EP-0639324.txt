<ABSTRACT>
A narrow harvester (30), which has a pair of 
longitudinal conveyors (66) with a horizontal portion (68) inline with the 

front wheels (42) and the rear wheels (54) and an inclined portion 
(70) that rise 

above the rear wheels (54). The conveyors (66) are placed to allow 
the wheels (42,54) 

to be adjacent to the chassis allowing a narrow harvester (30), 
and so that 

the harvester (30) is open in the front, allowing a wider passage for 
plants to pass through.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mobile harvesters 
such as grape and raisin harvesters. In the past, the length of such 
harvesters have been minimized making the harvester easier to 
handle, and a result harvesters tend to be wider. Narrower rows in 
crops such as grapes are desirable, but the prior are harvesters are 
too wide to harvest in narrower rows. The inventive narrow harvester has a pair of 
longitudinal conveyors with a horizontal portions extending from the 
front wheels to the rear wheels and an inclined portion that rise 
above the rear wheels. The conveyors are L-shaped and placed to 
allow the wheels to be adjacent to the chassis allowing a narrow 
harvester, and so that the harvester is open in the front, allowing a 
wider passage for plants to pass through the front of the vehicle. The present invention provides a narrow harvester, 
which is able to harvest in narrower rows. Figure 1 is a side elevation of a narrow harvester of 
the present invention. Figure 2 is a rear elevation of the first embodiment of 
the narrow harvester having a discharge conveyor positioned to 
receive the harvested grapes or raisins and discharge them into a 
truck or container. Figure 3 is a top view of the narrow harvester. Figure 4 is a sectional view of one of the longitudinal 
conveying systems with parts cut away. Figure 5 is a section taken along lines 5-5 of Figure 4 
illustrating several components of one of the conveying systems. Figure 6 is a horizontal section taken along lines 6-6 of 
Figure 5. Having reference to the narrow harvester 30 (Figs. 1 
and 2) of the present invention illustrating an upper platform 32 on 
a main frame 33 which supports a conventional engine 34 with the 
usual controls for operating the engine. The engine and controls are 
supported on the upper platform 32 and are accessible by a ladder 
36 connected to the upper platform 32 and having steps 40 (Fig. 1).  The upper platform 32 is partially supported by the 
main frame 33 and a pair of small steerable front wheels 42, only 
one being shown in Figure 1. Each front wheel 42 is journaled on an 
axle 44 which is welded to an upright steering rods 46 (Fig. 1) that 
are pivotally connected to the upper platform 32. The steering rods 
46 are connected to the steering wheel 50 of the harvester 30 
through a conventional linkage. As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, a pair of drive 
wheels 54 are connected to the engine 34 by conventional drive 
systems. As best shown in Figures 1 and 2, a pair of shaker 
heads 60 and 62 are

<CLAIMS>
A narrow harvester for harvesting crops from 
plants, comprising: 

   a chassis; 
   means for removing crops from the plants supported 

by the chassis; 
   a left front wheel supporting the chassis; 

   a right front wheel supporting the chassis; 
   a left rear wheel supporting the chassis; 

   a right rear wheel supporting the chassis; 
   a first conveyor, comprising a horizontal portion, 

wherein the horizontal portion is inline with the left front wheel and 
the left rear wheel; and 

   a second conveyor, comprising a horizontal portion, 
wherein the horizontal portion is in line with the right front wheel 

and the right rear wheel. 
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the 
first conveyor further comprises an upwardly extending portion, 

which extends from in front of the left rear wheel to above the left 
rear wheel, and wherein second conveyor further comprises an 

upwardly extending portion, which extends from in front of the right 
rear wheel to above the right rear wheel. 
The apparatus according to claim 2, further 
comprising a first means for directing crops into the first conveyor 

and a second means for directing crops into the second conveyor. 
The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein said 
first means for directing crops is partially formed from a first group 

of spring loaded plates which contact the plants, and wherein said 
second means for directing crops is partially formed from a second 

group of spring loaded plates which contact the plants. 
The apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the 
first conveyor comprises: 

   a plurality of plastic links pivotally connected 
together wherein the plastic links have hooks; 

   a first plurality of bolts connecting aid plastic links 
together;

 
   a plurality of transversely extending steel strips 

rigidly secured to spaced links; 
   an endless stretchable rubber belt supported on 

said spaced links and having inwardly sloping side walls; 
   a plurality of spaced upstanding cross-bars rigidly 

secured to said stretchable rubber belt supported on said spaced 
links and having inwardly sloping side walls; 

   a pair of guides along a transition from the 
horizontal portion to the inclined portion, wherein the hooks grip 

the pair of guides; and 
   a plurality of spaced upstanding cross-bars rigidly 

secured to said stretchable rubber belt for pushing the crop. 
The apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the 
first conveyor goes over the upwardly extending portion, and then 

folds under the upwardly extending portion and under the 
transition from the horizontal portion to the inclined portion, and 

then under the horizontal portion.
