<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ethoxylated acetylenic glycols
suitability as a surfactant for aqueous coating systems.The waterborne coatings and ink industries require surfactants
that provide excellent surface tension reducing capabilities for
substrate wetting. Equilibrium surface tension performance is important
when the system is at rest. End-users also need surfactants with good
dynamic performance which is a measure of a surfactant's ability to
provide wetting under high speed application such as when coatings are
spray applied or inks are printed.Traditional nonionic surfactants such as alkylaryl or alcohol
ethoxylates, and ethylene oxide (EO)-propylene oxide (PO) copolymers
have excellent equilibrium surface tension performance but are generally
characterized as having poor dynamic surface tension reduction. In
contrast, certain anionic surfactants such as sodium dialkyl
sulfosuccinates can provide good dynamic results, but these are very
foamy and impart water sensitivity to the finished coating.Surfactants based on acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol
and its ethoxylates are known for their
good balance of equilibrium and dynamic surface tension reducing
capabilities with little of the negative features of traditional
nonionic and anionic surfactants. The molecules, however, may not
provide the very low surface tension reduction needed for the wetting of
contaminated surfaces or low surface energy substrates. In those cases,
end-users may require silicone or fluorocarbon based surfactants which
may be costly, foamy, exhibit poor dynamic performance and often cause
adhesion problems.The following patents and articles describe various acetylenic
alcohols and their ethoxylates as surface active agents: US 3,268,593 discloses ethyleneoxide adducts of tertiary
acetylenic alcohols represented by the structural formula

wherein R1 and R4 are alkyl radicals having from 3-10 carbon atoms and R2
and R3 are methyl or ethyl and x and y have a sum in the range of 3 to
60, inclusive. Specific ethyleneoxide adducts include the ethyleneoxide
adducts of 3-methyl-1-nonyn-3-ol; 7,10-dimethyl-8-hexadecyne-7,10-diol;
2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol; and
4,7-dimethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol. Preferably, the ethyleneoxide adducts
range from 3 to 20 units. The patentees point out that these
ethyleneoxide adducts have outstanding wetting property and that the
presence of the acetylenic bond in the hydrophobic chain increases water
solubility and improves surfactant properties. As the
