<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a stepping motor for timepieces, comprising a core (1) and a stator (2) which surrounds the rotor (3), the purpose of saturating the stator at the constrictions adjacent to the rotor is served by the flux generated in the core. A particularly advantageous combination of materials results on providing, for the stator, a nickel-iron alloy comprising from 34 to 40% by weight of nickel, from 0.1 to 8% of Mo, Nb, Cr, Mn, V and/or from 0.1 to 5% of Si, Al, Ti, the remainder being iron, and at the same time employing, as the material for the core (1), a binary nickel-iron alloy, comprising at least 42% nickel, whose saturation induction is above 1.3 T.

Stepping motor for an electric clock, in particular 
for an analogue crystal-controlled clock, having a 

single-piece stator (2) which surrounds a rotor (3) and 
is made from a material of high saturation induction, and 

having a coil core (1) for pulsed magnetization of the 
stator, which consists of a magnetically soft material of 

higher saturation induction than that of the material of 
the stator, characterized in that the stator (2) consists 

of a nickel-iron alloy having 34 to 40% by weight of 
nickel and saturation induction-reducing additives in the 

range of 0.5 to 8% of one or more of the elements Mo, Nb, 
Zr, Mn, V, Cr and/or 0.5 to 5% of one or more of the 

elements Si, Al, Ti, while at the same time the material 
of the coil core (1) consists of a binary nickel-iron 

alloy having a nickel content of more than 42% and a 
saturation induction of more than 1.3 T without the said 

additives. 
Stepping motor according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the material of the stator consists of a 

nickel-iron alloy having 34 to 35% nickel and 3 to 6% 
molybdenum or chromium. 
Stepping motor according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the material of the coil core consists of a 

binary nickel-iron alloy having 45 to 50% nickel.
