<ABSTRACT>
Novel oligomers are disclosed which have enhanced ability with respect to forming duplexes or triplexes compared with oligomers containing only conventional bases. The oligomers contain the bases 5-(1-propynyl)uracil, 5-(1-propynyl)cytosine or related analogs. The oligomers of the invention are capable of (i) forming triplexes with various target sequences such as virus or oncogene sequences by coupling into the major groove of a target DNA duplex at physiological pH or (ii) forming duplexes by binding to single-stranded DNA or to RNA encoded by target genes. The oligomers of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and can be constructed to have any desired sequence, provided the sequence normally includes one or more bases that is replaced with the analogs of the invention. Compositions of the invention can be used as pharmaceutical agents to treat various diseases such as those caused by viruses and can be used for diagnostic purposes in order to detect viruses or disease conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to novel
oligonucleotide analogs, which are useful in
oligonucleotide-based therapy and diagnosis by binding of
the oligonucleotide analogs to single or double-stranded
nucleic acid target sequences. More specifically, the
invention concerns oligonucleotides containing certain 5-substituted
pyrimidine base residues and intermediates in
their synthesis.Sequence-specific binding of oligonucleotides
both to single-stranded RNA and DNA and to duplex DNA has
been demonstrated. The appropriate sequence recognition
for binding to single-stranded targets is well known:
the A-T and G-C pairing characteristic of duplex 
formation has been established as the basis for DNA
replication and transcription.More recently, oligonucleotides have been shown
to bind in a sequence-specific manner to duplex DNA to
form triplexes. Single-stranded nucleic acid, primarily
RNA, is the target molecule for oligonucleotides that are
used to inhibit gene expression by an "antisense"
mechanism (Uhlmann, E., et al, Chem Reviews (1990)
90:543-584; van der Krol, A.R., et al, Biotechniques
(1988) 6:958-976). Antisense oligonucleotides are
postulated to exert an effect on target gene expression
by hybridizing with a complementary RNA sequence. In
this model, the hybrid RNA-oligonucleotide duplex
interferes with one or more aspects of RNA metabolism
including processing, translation and metabolic turnover.
Chemically modified oligonucleotides have been used to
enhance their nuclease stability.Duplex DNA can be specifically recognized by
oligomers based on a recognizable nucleomonomer sequence.
Two major recognition motifs have been recognized. In an
earlier description of a "CT" motif, protonated cytosine
residues recognize G-C basepairs while thymine residues
recognize A-T basepairs in the duplex. These recognition
rules are outlined by Maher III, L.J., et al., Science
(1989) 245:725-730; Moser, H.E., et al., Science (1987)
238:645-650. More recently, an additional motif, termed
"GT" recognition, has been described (Beal, P.A., et al,
Science (1992) 251:1360-1363; Cooney, M., et al., Science
(1988) 241:456-459; Hogan, M.E., et al., EP Publication
375408). In the G-T motif, A-T pairs are recognized by
adenine or thymine residues and G-C pairs by guanine
residues. In both of these binding motifs, the
recognition sequence of the oligomer must align with the
complementary sequence of the purine chain of the duplex;
thus, recognition, for example, of an A-T pair by a
thymine, depends on the location of the adenyl
