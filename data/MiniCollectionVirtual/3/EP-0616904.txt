<ABSTRACT>
In a method for applying identification marks (10,16) on a sheetlike ground (12), the latter is provided with a base layer (18) of an adhesive which is or becomes transparent and then a pliant base web (14) which bears the mark (16) and whose format is at most that of the bed of adhesive (18) is pressed on, whereupon at least one further layer of adhesive (20) is applied with smoothing of the web (14) underneath. Preferably the web (14) has been lightly impregnated with a wet strength enhancer and is printed after it has dried with the mark (16) which is applied to the web (14) as a matter of choice in one or more colours and is heat-set thereon, for example 40 s at about 180@C. Of particular suitability is a paper web (14) having a basis weight below 25 g/m, a wall thickness of 10 to 500  mu m, preferably 50 to 100  mu m, and an average pore size of 100 to 300 mu m, preferably 150 to 250  mu m. The mark (16) consists of a very finely disperse, thinnable, light- and weather-resistant ink which has a solids content of not more than 20%.

A method of applying identification marks to a 
planar substrate by providing the substrate with a 

basic layer of adhesive which is or becomes 
transparent, and by pressing a carrier web including 

the identification mark into the basic layer, the 
size of the carrier web being not more than the size 

of the basic adhesive layer, whereupon a further 
adhesive layer is applied to the carrier web with 

the latter being smoothed. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein prior to 
being pressed into the basic adhesive layer the 

carrier web is impregnated with a wet-strength 
agent, preferably at an impregnation amount of less 

than 2% to 6%, based on the weight of the web. 
The method according to claim 2, wherein the carrier 
web has the identification mark printed thereon 

after the impregnation has dried. 
The method according to claim 3, wherein the 
identification mark is applied to the carrier web 

optionally in one or a plurality of colors and is 
heat-set. 
The method according to claim 4, wherein the 
identification mark is heat-set at a temperature of 

about 180°C for at least 40 s.  
 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein at least one adhesive and/or varnish layer 

is applied to the adhesive layer covering the 
carrier web. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein the basic adhesive layer as well as the 

adhesive layer and every further adhesive layer are 
made of the same material so that the carrier web is 

homogeneously embedded on all sides and absorbs 
binders. 
Means of applying identification marks, particularly 
transfer (10) for application to a planar substrate 

(12), namely for performing the method according to 
any one of claims 1 to 7, consisting of a flexible 

carrier web (14) which has an identification mark 
(16) printed thereon and can liberally be applied to 

the substrate (12) which is provided with an at 
least equally sized adhesive bed (18) of an adhesive 

which is or becomes transparent, with the carrier 
web (14) being coatable with at least one adhesive 

layer. 
The means according to claim 8, wherein the web (14) 

is a specifically lightweight, thin paper web 
impregnated with a wet-strength agent, such as 

epichlorohydrine resin or melamine resin. 
The means according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the 
weight per unit area of the web (14) is below 25 

g/m
2
 and the wall thickness thereof ranges from 10 
to 500 µm.  

 
The means according to any one of claims 8 to 10, 
wherein the average pore size of the web (14) ranges 

from 100 to 300 µm. 
The means according to any one of claims 8 to 11, 
wherein the identification mark (16) consists of a 

heat-set, extremely finely disperse, water-dilutable, 
light-fast and weather-resisting ink 

which is suited for screen printing or flexo 
printing. 
The means according to claim 12, wherein the 
printing ink has a solid content of not more than 

20%. 
The means according to any one of claims 8 to 13, 
wherein the means is coated with a final layer of 

varnish.
