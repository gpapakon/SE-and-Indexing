<ABSTRACT>
An efficient process for producing a solid catalyst for use in the synthesis of methacrylic acid from methacrolein, which 
comprises adding a lower alcohol or acetone to a dried solution or aqueous slurry containing at least molybdenum, phosphorus 

and vanadium as the catalytic components and extruding the resultant mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a catalyst used for synthesis of methacrylic
acid from methacrolein by gas phase catalytic oxidation.Hitherto, many proposals have been made on the
process for synthesis of methacrylic acid by gas phase
catalytic oxidation of methacrolein and on the catalysts
used therefor. Especially, since heteropoly-acid type
catalysts have been found as catalysts for oxidation of
methacrolein, improvement of the catalysts has been
proposed in many patents such as, for example, Japanese
Patent Kokai (Laid-Open) Nos. 58-96041, 61-7233, 62-153243,
3-238051.When these catalysts are used in a fixed bed,
the catalyst particles must be molded into a suitable
size. For the molding of catalysts, it is necessary to
employ the conditions most preferable for the properties
of the catalyst components per se and the reaction used,
and in the case of such a partial oxidation reaction of
methacrolein to methacrylic acid as of the present
invention, pores inside the molded catalyst are 
important to obtain the desired product in a high yield.
By securing the pores, catalysts excellent in both the
activity and the selectivity can be obtained.However, the heteropoly-acids used in the
present invention are inherently poor in moldability and
when the conventional pressure molding is employed, a
high pressure is required in order to make a molded
product having a mechanical strength which can stand
industrial use. Therefore, it is difficult to secure
the pores in the molded catalysts.For solving the above problem, mention may be
made of the wet molding method. In general, according
to the wet molding method, the dry catalyst powder is
mixed with an assistant such as a moisturizing
component, the resulting mixture is molded into a
suitable size, and the molded product is heat treated to
remove the moisturizing component. Therefore, this
method has the merit that it is easy to secure pores
inside the molded catalyst as compared with the pressure
molding. Water is normally used as the moisturizing
component in the wet molding.However, since the constituting component of
heteropoly-acids dissolves in water, when the wet
molding method is applied to the heteropoly-acids and if
only water is used as the moisturizing component, there
is the tendency that the catalyst active component
dissolves away and consequently the inherent performance
of the catalyst cannot be exhibited. As examples of adding a moisturizing component
other than water at the time of wet molding, mention may
be made of
