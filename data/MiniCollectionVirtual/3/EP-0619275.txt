<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided for controlling the diameter of a coated 
optical waveguide fiber. The viscosity profile of the coating material is controlled by 

adjusting the temperature of a portion of the coating assembly based on a 
measurement of the diameter of the coated fiber. By controlling the viscosity profile 

of the coating material, the amount of coating applied to the fiber is controlled, 
thereby determining the diameter of the coated fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the coating of optical waveguide fibers.In the manufacture of optical waveguide fibers, a preferred method for
manufacturing the fibers is i) produce a preform using deposition techniques such as
outside vapor deposition (OVD), vapor axial deposition (VAD) or modified chemical
vapor deposition (MCVD); ii) dehydrate and consolidate the OVD or VAD soot
preform (or, collapse the MCVD preform) to produce a solid glass preform; and iii)
draw the glass preform into fiber. Because of the requirements of high strength and
low loss, a protective coating is applied to the drawn fiber before the pristine surface
of the fiber is damaged by subsequent handling, either during manufacture or
subsequent use. This coating step is typically performed as an integral part of the
drawing process to ensure that the coating material is applied before the surface of the
fiber is damaged. Optical fibers are also combined in arrays, known as ribbon fibers,
the manufacture of which requires that an overcoating be applied to an array of coated
or uncoated optical fibers.A coating material commonly used in the manufacture of optical waveguide
fibers is an acrylate-based composition which is curable by exposure to ultraviolet
(UV) light. This material is applied to the surface of the fiber in a liquid state and is 
subsequently exposed to UV light for curing. The coating material may be applied in
one or more layers, with a two-layer coating system being a preferred embodiment.
The first, or primary, coating is applied directly to the surface of the fiber, and the
second, or secondary, coating is applied over the primary coating.When coating an optical waveguide fiber, it is important to produce, at high
drawing rates, coated fibers with consistent coated diameter and coatings which are
applied concentrically to the fiber. Both of these attributes contribute to ease in
splicing and connectorization of the fiber, thereby providing for lower losses in an
installed fiber application. The higher draw rates reduce the cost of manufacturing
the fiber by increasing output and equipment utilization. Market demands continue to
place more stringent tolerances on the coated diameter of an optical waveguide fiber.
Present manufacturing processes provide coatings with tolerances of about ± 15 µm,
while tolerances in the range of about ± 3-5 µm are needed.Much work has been directed toward cooling the drawn fiber prior to
receiving the first layer of coating material. This is required because the high
