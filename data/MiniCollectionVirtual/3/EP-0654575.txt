<ABSTRACT>
Known safety contact rails have a securing strip (1), a sheath part (3) and an inner element (5) arranged therein. In this arrangement, the inner element (5) and the sheath part (3) are designed to be electrically conductive and, in the case of mutual contact, trigger a switching pulse which can be fed to an evaluation unit. As a result of the electrically conductive construction, the sheath part can be more easily damaged than other parts and can also effect false triggering. Since, as a result, the surface is also electrically conductive, the accidental transfer of voltage to control units connected downstream is also possible. As a result of coating the sheath part (3) with an electrically non-conductive outer protective layer (6), which is preferably produced by means of extrusion together with the securing strip (1), the inner element designed as a knife-like rib (5) and the sheath part (3), faulty triggering as a result of, for example, contamination of the sheath part (3) is excluded. Likewise, the protective layer (6) can be deliberately designed to be resistant to specific damaging surface influences, which can for example be given by acids, without the electrical conductivity of the sheath part (3) being influenced in a disadvantageous manner.

A safety contact edge for power operated installations, such as roller
doors, roller gratings etc., and elevating platforms, work platforms and

the like and for the securing of machines or spaces with a fastening
web (1) and a hollow rubber profile having a cover part (3) whereby the

fastening web (1) is produced from an electrically non-conducting
material and in the hollow rubber profile an inner body is provided and

whereby the inner body and the cover part (3) have electrically
conducting zones, which when they touch each other initiate a

switching pulse which can be taken to an evaluating unit and whereby
the outer surface of the part of the cover part (3) corresponding to the

whole of the electrically conducting zone is provided with an overlay,
characterised in that
 the overlay is formed as an electrically non-conducting
protective layer (6), that the protective layer starting from

the fastening web (1) and seamlessly attached to it encompasses the
whole of the electrically conducting zone of the cover part (3) and that

the protective layer (6) is produced from the same material as the
fastening web (1) and is extruded as one piece with the fastening web

(1) and with the cover part (3).
A safety contact edge according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the thickness of the protective layer (6) amounts
to 0.1 to 1.5 mm, preferably 0.3 to 0.5 mm.
A safety contact edge according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that
 the inner body is a knife-like rib, which is
produced as one piece with the fastening web (1) and the cover part

(3).
A safety contact edge according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that
 in at least one of the electrically conducting
zones at least one electrically conducting braid is set in. 
A safety contact edge according to claim 4,
characterised in that
 the braid is arranged in a region of an extended
cross sectional surface of the electrically conducting zone.
