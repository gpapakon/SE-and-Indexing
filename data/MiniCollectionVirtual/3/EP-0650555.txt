<ABSTRACT>
A carburetor assembly having a venturi element for fuel metering and a throttle valve for controlling the flow of an air and natural gas mixture to the combustion chamber of an internal combustion gas engine wherein a stepper motor is used to angularly position a throttle valve plate in the gas flow path to the carburetor, the throttle valve plate being carried on a throttle valve shaft that forms an extension of the armature of the stepper motor wherein provision is made for sealing the stepper motor at a location on the axis of rotation of the throttle valve element, the throttle valve shaft being mounted without the necessity for using throttle valve shaft bearings or a separate seal, thereby minimizing friction and any tendency for a misalignment to occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
Our invention relates generally to internal 
combustion engines using natural gas as a fuel and to 
improvements in a carburetor for developing a 
combustible mixture of natural gas and air for an 
internal combustion gas engine. It is common practice in the art of internal 
combustion engines to provide an air/fuel mixture 
carburetor having a throttle plate situated in a 
throttle body in the path of flow of a combustible 
air/fuel mixture. The throttle valve element is 
located on the downstream side of a venturi which 
develops a venturi pressure at its throat to 
facilitate distribution of fuel to the intake air. In 
the case of a liquid fuel carburetor, atomization 
occurs at the point of entry of the fuel into the 
carburetor throat. In the case of a carburetor 
assembly for a natural gas engine, atomization, of 
course, is not required; but the negative pressure 
developed at the throat of the venturi is used to 
obtain a flow of natural gas in the region of the 
venturi throat where it may mix with intake air. The 
resulting air/fuel mixture flow is controlled by the 
throttle plate at a point downstream from the venturi 
section. It is usual practice in carburetor 
assemblies of this type to control the position of the  
 
throttle plate by means of a throttle plate actuator 
gear train or a complex throttle linkage mechanism 
which would be under the control of an operator-controlled 
throttle element. Attempts have been made in prior art designs 
to simplify the throttle linkage mechanism by using a 
direct-drive connection between the throttle valve 
lever and the throttle plate so that an intervening 
gear train or throttle linkage is not required. This 
substantially reduces cost, reduces complexity of 
design, and improves reliability. An example of a direct-acting throttle valve 
plate and plate actuator assembly is shown in prior 
art patent 4,779,592 wherein a stepper motor under the 
control of an electronic processor for an internal 
combustion engine is connected directly to a throttle 
shaft to which is secured a throttle plate located in 
an air intake passage for an internal combustion 
engine. The throttle plate is carried by a throttle 
shaft that is journalled and supported on the wall of 
the air intake passage. The throttle plate is fixed 
to the shaft so that no adjustment of the throttle 
blade with respect to the shaft may occur. The shaft 
is connected also to an accelerator pedal by a 
throttle linkage mechanism so that, as the accelerator 
pedal is depressed,

<CLAIMS>
A carburetor for a gas engine comprising a 
throttle body (46), an air inlet passage (56, 58, 60) 

in said throttle body (46) adapted to communicate with 
an air/fuel mixture inlet flow conduit (50); 


a shaft opening (110, 120) in said throttle body 
(46) extending in a direction transverse to said inlet 

passage (56, 58, 60); 
an electric actuator motor (106) mounted in said 
throttle body (46) on the exterior thereof and having 

an armature shaft (114) extending into said shaft 
opening (110, 120); 
a throttle shaft (118) in said shaft opening 
(110, 120); 
a throttle plate (131) in said inlet flow 
conduit (50), there being a mechanical connection (127, 

133) between said throttle plate (131) and said 
throttle shaft (118) whereby rotary adjustment of said 

throttle shaft (118) by said motor (106) effects 
opening and closing of said inlet flow conduit (50); 


characterised in that
 said throttle shaft (118) is 
carried solely by and is driven by said armature shaft 

(114) for rotation within but in isolation from said 
throttle body (46). 
The carburetor as set forth in claim 1, wherein 
said motor (106) is a stepper motor (106) and has a 

mounting shoulder (108) formed thereon in registry with 
said throttle shaft opening (110) and a seal (112) 

surrounding said throttle shaft (118) adjacent said 
shoulder (108) whereby said throttle shaft opening 

(110, 120) is effectively sealed from said exterior 
thereby eliminating friction between said throttle 

shaft (118) and said throttle body (46).  
 
The carburetor as set forth in claim 1 or dlaim 
2, wherein said carburetor comprises a fuel metering 

orifice (74), a venturi element (54) in said inlet 
passage (56, 58, 60), fuel metering passage means (62, 

64, 68, 76) in said throttle body (46) communicating 
with said venturi element (54), said fuel metering 

passage means (62, 64, 68, 76) being adjusted to supply 
combustible gas to said venturi element (54). 
The carburetor as set forth in claim 3, wherein 
said engine has liquid coolant passages (32, 34) and 

said carburetor comprises an air/fuel mixture 
enrichment passage (98, 102, 104) in said throttle body 

(46) that bypasses said orifice (74), and a solenoid 
operated valve means (100) for opening and closing said 

enrichment passage (98, 102, 104) in response to 
coolant temperature changes. 
The carburetor as set forth in claim 1 or claim 
2, wherein said carburetor comprises a fuel metering 

orifice (74), a venturi element (54) in said inlet 
passage (56, 58, 60) fuel metering passage means (62,

with said venturi element (54), said fuel metering 

passage means (62, 64, 68, 76) being adjusted to supply 
combustible gas to said venturi element (54). 
The carburetor as set forth in any of the 
preceding claims, wherein said mechanical connection 

(127, 133) is a lost-motion connection comprising means 
(127, 133) for accommodating adjustment of said 

throttle plate (131) relative to said throttle shaft 
(118) whereby interference between said throttle body 

(46) and said throttle plate (131) is avoided as said
