<ABSTRACT>
Rolled materials are joined effectively without causing qualitative defects to occur therein and without 
employing any large-scale expensive equipment, such as a swing roller during the transfer of the rolled materials, 

whereby a continuous hot rolling operation can be carried out. Continuous hot rolling method and apparatus for 
bringing the front end of a following rolled material into abutment with the rear end of a preceding rolled material 

and welding these abutting ends of each other by applying a laser beam or plasma thereto from above the upper 
surfaces of the materials while the materials are moved between a roughing mill and a finishing mill. According to 

the present invention, it becomes possible to weld rolled materials to each other from above the upper surfaces thereof 
efficiently in a short period of time without stopping the materials and without causing splashes and burrs to occur,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of continuous
hot rolling for manufacturing hot strips when sheet bars are
continuously hot-rolled, and more particularly relates to a
method of rolling sheet bars continuously and an apparatus
for welding sheet bars by which the sheet bars are joined
while the welding apparatus is traveling at a rolling speed.Conventionally, in a hot rolling line, after slabs have
been heated in a heating furnace, they are extracted from the
heating furnace one by one and subjected to rough and finish
rolling intermittently. Therefore, it is difficult to
provide a product, the quality of which is uniform from the
top to the tail of the product. Further, it is impossible to
raise the rolling speed until the top of a strip reaches the
coiler. According to the conventional method and apparatus,
the above problems are encountered in view of quality and
productivity. In order to solve the above problems, a large
number of proposals have been made recently for hot-rolling
sheet bars continuously in such a manner that the tail of a
preceding sheet bar and the top of a succeeding sheet bar are
butted and welded while they are traveling and the welded
sheet bars are continuously rolled.In this hot rolling method, the following conditions
must be satisfied.
(1) Defects in quality such as scale pressed marks are
not caused.(2) Since the sheet bars are subjected to continuous
hot rolling, the preceding and succeeding sheet bars must be
joined in a short period of time without being stopped.(3) It is preferable that an apparatus to be introduced
for welding sheet bars is not large so that the apparatus can
be easily added to an established hot rolling line.On the other hand, there is a good possibility that
defects in quality are caused by the conventional continuous
hot rolling method, so that it is difficult to put the
conventional continuous hot rolling method into practical
use. For example, the prior art in this field is disclosed
in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 60-24201 in
which the sheet bars are joined by means of thermit welding.
However, this method is disadvantageous in that the splashes
and burrs caused in the process of welding sheet bars are
peeled off from the sheet bars in the successive rolling
process, so that the rollers are damaged and defects are
caused on the surface of a strip. Further, in the process of
thermit welding, a long period of time is required for
melting and cooling, and it takes time to join the sheet
bars.A large number of methods are
