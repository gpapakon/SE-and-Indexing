<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water-air heat exchanger of aluminium or an aluminium alloy for motor vehicles, in particular a heater heat exchanger or engine radiator, having a two-pass (passage, duct) or multi-pass arrangement of rows of parallel flat tubes (2) which are soldered to one another via zigzag plates (4), and having at least one tank (cooling-water tank, cooling-water reservoir) (6) connecting in a communicating fashion to one group of ends of flat tubes (2), in which a partition (30) divides an inlet chamber provided with an inlet (32) from an outlet chamber provided with an outlet (34) and whose tube plate (sheet) (8) has slots into which the ends of the flat tubes are inserted in a soldered fashion against the tube plate (8). It is provided in this design that the flat tubes (2) themselves are designed at least in a two-pass fashion by means of at least one partition (36) extending in the longitudinal direction. Between neighbouring oppositely directed passes, in a connecting region (40) at the ends of the flat tubes (2) remote from the tank (6), the partition (36) is respectively cut out over a length along which the adjacent oppositely directed passes communicate. The partition (36) is formed by shaping a sheet-metal part forming the flat tube (2). In the connecting region (40) where the adjacent oppositely directed passes communicate, communication is unrestricted, or is at most reduced only by two wall thicknesses of the flat tube (2). Dents on one or both sides are distributed in the manner of a grid along the oppositely directed passes over the wall of the flat tubes (2) and are dimensioned in addition to the respective partition (36) as spacers for the two flat sides of the respective flat tube (2).

Water-air heat exchanger made of aluminium or other 
aluminium alloy for motor vehicles, especially a heater heat 

exchanger or an engine radiator, with a bank of at least double 
flow parallel flat tubes (2) which are soldered to each other 

by way of zig zag fins (4), with at least one water box (6) 
communicatingly connected to the one ends of the flat tubes (2) 

and divided by a partition (30) into an inlet chamber provided 
with an inlet (32) and an outlet chamber provided with an 

outlet (34) and whose tube bottom (8) has slots (12) into which 
the ends of the flat tubes are inserted and soldered with 

respect to the tube bottom (8), wherein 

the flat tubes (2) themselves are formed to be of at 
least double flow by at least one lengthwise partition (36), 

the partition (36) being left open along a length between 
adjoining contra flow passages in a connecting region (40) at 

the ends of the flat tubes (2) remote from the water box (6), 
the adjoining contra flow passages communicating along that 

length, 
the partition (36) being formed by deformation of a 
single sheet metal part that forms the flat tube (2) and is cut 

out to form the connecting region (40), and 
in the connecting region (40) of communication of 
adjoining contra flow passages, communication is unthrottled or 

is reduced by at most two wall thicknesses of the flat 
tube (2), 
 
characterised in that 


the partition (36) is formed by only one material 
thickness of the sheet metal part, which in the region of the 

partition (36) is bent from one flat side of the flat tube (2) 
towards its other flat side, and at the connecting locations of 

the respective continuing flat side of the flat tube (2) forms 
an externally flush overlap with the respective end of the 

sheet metal part along the transverse stretch of the respective 
flat side, and 
wall indentations (60) are distributed in a pattern 
along the contra flow passages, in one or both sides, in the  

 
wall of the flat tubes (2), which, additionally to the 

respective partition (36), are dimensioned as spacers for the 
two flat sides of the respective flat tube (2). 
Heat exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the ends of the flat tubes (2) remote from the water 

box (6), are soldered into grooves (42) of a closure 
plate (44). 
Heat exchanger according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the stack of flat tubes (2) and zig zag 

fins (4) is held between side plates (46) and soldered to them, 
and that the side plates (46) themselves are in soldered 

engagement with positive fit in retaining recesses, both of the 
tube bottom (8) of the water box (6) and also of the closure 

plate (44). 
Heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that also the lid (10) of the respective water 

box (6) consists of aluminium or other aluminium alloy and is 
soldered to the tube bottom (8). 
Heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that with two sided arrangement of the 

indentations (60), these bear against each other, preferably 
end to end or by way of their adjoining flanks. 
Heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the wall indentations (60) are soldered 

to the opposite wall or on the other hand to wall indentations 
of the same flat tube. 
Heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the wall indentations are distributed in 

accordance with a point pattern. 
Heat exchanger according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the pattern is orientated at an angle that diverges from 

90° with respect to the axis of the respective flat tube (2), 
preferably by between 3° and 20°. 
Water-air heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 
to 8, characterised in that 


an exterior access for flux for soldering the 
partition (36) of the respective flat tube (2) is provided  

 
which after soldering is closed off by the solder, and 
the exterior access for flux is provided in a region 
of overlap of the sheet metal part in the region of the flush 

connection of the two sides. 
Heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the sheet metal part of which the flat 

tube (2) is formed, is pre-coated with solder on both sides.
