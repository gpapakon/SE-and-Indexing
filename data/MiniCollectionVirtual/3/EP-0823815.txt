<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information receiving
apparatus for receiving service information transmitted from a sender
together with additional information.As transmission of much information is realized by digital
broadcasting, programs are presented in multiple channels, which gives
rise to necessity of an electronic program guide. The program information
of general electronic program guide is always transmitted, like the
teletext, from the broadcasting station as being inserted in the vertical
fly-back period of television broadcast. The receiver receives the program
information, stores it in the memory device, and, when all information
about programs for a specific period is received, displays it in the display
device as a program list. In such electronic program guide, a cursor is
displayed on the program list, and by moving the cursor by manipulating,
for example, a remote control device to give a command to a specific cell
showing a program name on the program list, various functions can be
executed. For example, when recording a certain program in a VTR, the
cell of the program on the program list is specified, and execution of
record reservation is commanded, so that the program can be
automatically recorded in the VTR (see Japanese Patent 6-504165).Thus, the electronic program guide is applicable to multiple 
functions of the multi-channel receiver and effective for enhancing the
controllability of the receiver.Besides, by the progress in communication technology such as
Internet, much information is stored, and it has been demanded to reduce
the size and increase the capacity of the memory device.In the conventional receiving apparatus for receiving such
electronic program guide, the information sent out from the transmission
side is stored in the memory device, and after receiving a program list for
a specific period, when the information repeatedly sent out from the
transmission side is received, the previously stored portion of the
program information in the memory device is updated and stored.
Therefore, the information in the electronic program guide is always
stored and updated regardless of the will of the viewer.Thus, in the conventional receiving apparatus for receiving the
conventional electronic program guide, the information in the electronic
program guide is always stored and updated regardless of the will of the
viewer, and the will of the data user is not reflected in filing of
information, and the memory medium may be occupied by the information
lowered in the value
