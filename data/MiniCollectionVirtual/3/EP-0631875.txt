<ABSTRACT>
An ink pen 10 is provided with a hydrophobic 
membrane 19 to control the leakage of ink 14. The ink pen 

has a vent 18, such as a bubble generator, to allow the 
ingress of air into the ink reservoir 12 and thereby 

regulate the backpressure within the reservoir. The 
hydrophobic membrane which allows the flow of air but 

prevents the flow of ink is positioned within the vent to 
control leakage of ink from the ink pen through the vent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink pens for
ink-jet printers, and more particularly, to an apparatus
for controlling ink leakage from the reservoir of an ink
pen.Ink-jet printers have become established as
reliable and efficient printing devices. Typically, an
ink-jet printer utilizes a print head which is moved
relative to a printing surface. A control system
activates the moving print head at the appropriate
locations causing the print head to eject, or jet, ink
drops onto the printing surface to form desired images and
characters. Such printers typically include an ink pen
which serves as a reservoir for storing ink and provides a
means of supplying ink, as needed, to the print head.There are two commonly used systems for ejecting
ink from a print head. The first is a thermal bubble
system and the second is a piezoelectric system. A print
head using either system typically includes a plurality of
orifices, each orifice having an associated chamber. In
operation, ink is supplied via an inlet to the chamber.
Upon activation, the ink is forced, or jetted, from the
chamber through the orifice and onto the printing surface.
In thermal bubble type print heads, the ink in the chamber
is heated or vaporized, typically by a thin film resistor.
The rapid expansion which results from vaporization of the
ink forces a quantity of ink from the chamber through the
orifice. In piezoelectric type print heads, a
piezoelectric element creates a pressure wave within the
chamber which ejects a quantity of ink through the
orifice.Although both thermal bubble and piezoelectric
print heads provide a reliable and efficient means of
jetting ink from an orifice, both types of print heads 
generally have no mechanism to prevent the free flow of
ink through the orifice when the print head is not
activated. If this occurs, ink may leak, or drool,
uncontrollably through the print head. Typically,
printers are provided with catch basins to catch and
contain ink dripping from the print head. This helps to
prevent the ink from damaging the printer. However, the
ink may drip onto the printing surface to produce an
undesirable ink spot. In addition, leaking ink may build
up on the print head and impair the proper operation of
the print head. In any case, a leaking ink pen will
usually need to be discarded and replaced.To alleviate these problems, many ink-jet
printers supply ink from the ink pen to the print head at
a slight underpressure or backpressure. As used herein a
positive backpressure is used to refer to a pressure
within an

<CLAIMS>
An ink pen (10) for an ink-jet printer comprising:

a reservoir (12) for holding a supply of ink 14;
a vent (18) in the reservoir (12) for selectively admitting
ambient air into the reservoir (12) to maintain a backpressure

within the reservoir (12) within an operating range for the
ink pen (10) which allows the ink pen to eject said ink while

preventing free flow of said ink from the ink pen, the vent
(18) comprising a bubble generator that traps a quantity of

said ink within the vent by capillary forces, said trapped
quantity of ink sealing the vent (18) when said bac
kpressure
is within said operating range and allowing said ambient air

to bubble through said trapped quantity of ink and into the
reservoir (12) when said backpressure exceeds said operating

range to thereby lower said backpressure;
an inlet labyrinth (30) coupled to said vent; and
a hydrophobic membrane (19) coupled to said inlet labyrinth (30),
said hydrophobic membrane (19) allowing the passage of air

to said inlet labyrinth and
blocking the passage of ink from said inlet labyrinth.
An ink pen 10 in accordance with claim 1 in which the bubble
generator comprises a capillary member (24) positioned

within said vent to trap said trapped quantity of ink within
an orifice (10) to seal the vent when the backpressure within

the reservoir (12) is within said operating range.
An ink pen 10 in accordance with claim 2 in which the
orifice (20) is defined by a tubular boss (22) having the

capillary member (24) disposed therein. 
An ink pen in accordance with claim 3, wherein the said
first end is in fluid communication with said boss, said

inlet labyrinth (30) providing a containment volume for ink
that flows through the bubble generator when said

backpressure in said reservoir falls below said operating
range; and


said hydrophobic membrane allowing the passage of air
through said second end and into said inlet labyrinth (30) and

blocking passage of said ink through said second end to
prevent ink from escaping from said inlet labyrinth through

said second end.
An ink pen in accordance with claims 3 or 4
in which the capillary member (24) is a sphere concentrically

disposed within the boss (22) to form the orifice (20).
An ink pen in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 5
in which the hydrophobic membrane (19) allows the passage of

air at a rate of about 5.5 cubic centimeters per minute per
square millimeter with a pressure drop of less than about

1.3 centimeters water column.
An ink pen in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 6
in which the hydrophobic membrane (19) prohibits the flow of

ink up to a pressure of about (51) centimeters water column.
An ink pen in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 7
in which ink is removed from the surface of the hydrophobic

membrane when subject to a pressure of less than about 20.4
centimeters water column.
An ink pen in accordance with any one of the preceding
claims, further comprising:


an expandable bladder within said reservoir (12);
a spring biasing said expandable bladder to create a
backpressure within the reservoir (12).
