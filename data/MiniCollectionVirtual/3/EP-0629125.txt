<ABSTRACT>
An artery, vein, aneurysm, vascular malformation or arterial fistula is occluded through endovascular occlusion by the endovascular insertion of a platinum wire (56) and/or tip (53) into the vascular cavity. The vascular cavity is packed with the tip (58) to obstruct blood flow or access of blood in the cavity such that the blood clots in the cavity and an occlusion is formed. The tip may be elongate and flexible so that it packs the cavity by being folded upon itself a multiple number of times, or may pack the cavity by virtue of a filamentary or fuzzy structure of the tip (104). The tip is then separated from the wire mechanically or by electrolytic separation of the tip from the wire. The wire and the microcatheter (144) are thereafter removed leaving the tip embedded in the thrombus formed within the vascular cavity. Movement of wire in the microcatheter (144) is more easily tracked by providing a radiopaque proximal marker (110) on the microcatheter and corresponding indicator marker (112) on the wire. Electrothrombosis is facilitated by placing the ground electrode (114) on the distal end of the microcatheter and flowing current between the microcatheter electrode and the tip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for endovascular
electrothrombic formation of thrombi in arteries, veins, aneurysms, vascular
malformations and arteriovenous fistulas.Approximately 25,000 intracranial aneurysms rupture every year in North
America. The primary purpose of treatment for ruptured intracranial aneurysm is to
prevent rebleeding. At the present time, three general methods of treatment exist,
namely an extravascular, endovascular and extra-endovascular approach.The extravascular approach is comprised of surgery or microsurgery of the
aneurysm or treatment site for the purpose of preserving the parent artery. This
treatment is common with intracranial berry aneurysms. The methodology comprises
the step of clipping the neck of the aneurysm, performing a suture-ligation of the
neck, or wrapping the entire aneurysm. Each of these surgical procedures is
performed by intrusive invasion into the body and performed from outside the
aneurysm or target site. General anesthesia, craniotomy, brain retraction and
arachnoid dissection around the neck of the aneurysm and placement of a clip are 
typically required in these surgical procedures. Surgical treatment of vascular
intracranial aneurysm can expect a mortality rate of 4-8% with a morbidity rate of 18-20%.
Because of the mortality and morbidity rate expected, the surgical procedure is
often delayed while waiting for the best surgical time with the result that an
additional percentage of patients will die from the underlying disease or defect prior
to surgery. For this reason the prior art has sought alternative means of treatment.In the endovascular approach, the interior of the aneurysm is entered through
the use of a microcatheter. Recently developed microcatheters, such as those shown
by Engelson, "Catheter Guidewire", U.S. Patent 4,884,579 and as described in
Engelson, "Catheter for Guidewire Tracking", U.S. Patent 4,739,768 (1988), allow
navigation into the cerebral arteries and entry into a cranial aneurysm.In such procedures a balloon is typically attached to the end of the
microcatheter and it is possible to introduce the balloon into the aneurysm, inflate it,
and detach it, leaving it to occlude the sac and neck with preservation of the parent
artery. While endovascular balloon embolization of berry aneurysms is an attractive
method in situations where an extravascular surgical approach is difficult, inflation of
a balloon into the aneurysm carries some risk of aneurysm rupture due to possible
over-distention of portions of the sac and

<CLAIMS>
A microcatheter system for use in the formation
of an occlusion within a vascular cavity, the system

comprising:

a microcatheter (144) having a distal end adapted for
disposition in the proximity of the vascular

cavity; and
a conductive wire (10,56) for disposal in
said microcatheter (144) and for longitudinal displacement

therein, the wire comprising a core wire (10) and an
elongate tip portion (56) coupled to a distal portion of

the core wire (10), the tip portion (56) extending the core
wire (10) for a predetermined lineal extent and being

adapted to be positioned in the vascular cavity;

   characterised in that the distal end of the
microcatheter (144) has an electrode (114) disposed thereon.
A microcatheter system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the microcatheter electrode (114) is connectable to

a voltage source (70) by an electrical conductor (116)
disposed along the length of the microcatheter (144).
A microcatheter as claimed in claim 2, the
electrical conductor (116) and the conductive wire (10,56)

both being electrically connectable to the voltage source
whereby to cause a current flow path to be established 

between the electrode (114) and the elongate tip portion
(56).
A microcatheter as claimed in claim 3, wherein
the microcatheter electrode (114) is arranged to act

as a cathode and the elongate tip portion (56) is
arranged to act as an anode.
A microcatheter system as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, wherein the tip portion (56) is

detachable from the core wire (10) so as to allow the tip
portion to be detached and left in the vascular cavity

whilst the remainder of the conductive wire is removed from
the vasculature.
A microcatheter system as claimed in claim 5,
wherein the tip portion (56) is detachable from the core

wire (10) by electrolytic disintegration of part of the
conductive wire.
