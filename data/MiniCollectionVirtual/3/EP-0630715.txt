<ABSTRACT>
A tooling device for working an end of a pipe (2) contains an adjusting means with a clamping device (4) which can be restrained in the pipe (2), a first holding means (6) which is fixed to the clamping device (4) and in which an intermediate part (8) is mounted in a positionable manner, and a second holding means (10) which is mounted on this intermediate part (8) in a positionable manner and carries a machine tool. This measure permits a simple and rapid adjustment of the working centre and the working plane of the tooling device relative to the end of the pipe (2).

Machining device for machining an end of a 
pipe (2), comprising an adjusting device having a 

clamping device (4) which can be stayed on or in the 
pipe (2), characterised by a first holding device (6) 

which is fixed on the clamping device (4) and in which 
an intermediate portion (8) is mounted in a manner such 

that it can be positioned, as well as a second holding 
device (10), which is mounted on this intermediate 

portion (8) in a manner such that it can be positioned 
and supports a machine tool (20). 
Machining device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the intermediate portion (8) is 

mounted in the first holding device (6) in a manner 
such that it can be pivoted around a first axis (17). 
Machining device according to claim 1 or claim 
2, characterised in that the second holding device (10) 

is mounted on the intermediate portion (8) in a manner 
such that it can be pivoted around a second axis (19). 
Machining device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

intermediate portion (8) is mounted in the first 
holding device (6) in a manner such that it can be 

shifted in a first plane. 
Machining device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the second 

holding device (10) is mounted on the intermediate 
portion (8) in a manner such that it can be shifted in 

a second plane. 
Machining device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

intermediate portion (8) is provided, on its ends which 
are opposite each other, with a flange-like projection 

(82a, b). 
Machining device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the holding devices (6, 10) are  

 
each provided with a claw (7 and 11 respectively), 

which claws surround the flange-like projection (82a, 
b) of the intermediate portion (8). 
Machining device according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the flange-like projection (82a, 

b) has a curved lateral edge face (84a and 84b 
respectively). 
Machining device according to claim 8, 
characterised in that arranged in the claws (7, 11) of 

the holding device (6 and 11 respectively) are 
shiftable clamping wedges (14), the wedge face (142) of 

which rests eccentrically on the curved edge (84a, b) 
of the flange-like projection (82a and 82b 

respectively). 
Machining device according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the flange-like projections (92) 

each have a wedge-shaped edge face (94). 
Machining device according to claim 10, 
characterised in that arranged in the claws (114) of 

the holding device (104) are shiftable clamping pieces 
(15), the curved surface of which rests on the wedge-shaped 

edge face (94) of the flange-like projection 
(92). 
Machining device according to one of the 
claims 7 to 11, characterised in that the opposing ends 

of the intermediate portion (8, 9) each have a 
rectangular base surface, wherein in each case two edge 

faces (84a, b, 94) in the end region of the 
intermediate portion (8, 9), which edge faces are 

opposite each other, are arranged on flange-like 
projections (82a, b, 92) and are curved, and the two 

other lateral edge faces (86a, b) are planar. 
Machining device according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the flange-like projections (82a) 

at the one end and the flange-like projections (82b) at 
the other end of the intermediate portion (8) are  

 
arranged in a manner such that they are offset by 90Â° 

with respect to each other.
