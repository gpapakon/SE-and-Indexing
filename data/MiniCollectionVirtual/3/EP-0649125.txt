<ABSTRACT>
This device is installed between the cover lens of a signal lamp main body 
and the light source in order to prevent pseudo lighting phenomenon. This device 

(B) comprises a pair of plates of spherical lens matrices (200) each plate being 
formed by the following way: a large number of spheres are arranged on a plane in 

matrix, and so pressed and deformed that they are brought into contact with each 
other without gaps between them but with the spherical tops intact, these spherical 

tops serving as spherical lens elements. The device (B) further comprises a light 
shielding member (300) disposed between the plates as a spacer, having light transmitting 

slits which respectively receive lens planes of the spherical lens elements 
from the corresponding side, and determining the corresponding foci of the spherical 

lens elements of one of the plates in the vicinities of the vertexes of the lens 
planes of the spherical lens elements of the other plate. The solar rays which enter 

through the cover lens are once focused in the light transmitting slits by means of 
the composite spherical lens elements of the plate on the cover lens side, and then, 

diffused by the composite spherical lens elements of the plate on the light source 
side to reach the signal lamp body. The reflected rays which are reflected in the signal 

lamp and tend to exit are thus reduced. At the same time, the reflected rays are 
blocked by the light shielding member. Therefore, the contrast between the inside 

and outside of the signal lamp becomes remarkably clear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for preventing effectively signal lamps
from presenting a false lighting phenomenon caused by the sun light,
particularly by the rising sun, setting sun, and the like, so that the
state of lights, on and off, can be determined more distinctly.In the current automobile society, for instance, the role of the traffic
lights is extremely important in order to control road traffics smoothly.
Such traffic lights must be reliably recognizable by a driver under any
circumstances.As is well known, the traffic lights are of a self-emissive type using
electric bulbs. Therefore, if its surrounding brightness is low, the
relative luminance is high, making the lighting condition reliably
recognizable, but if the surroundings are considerably bright, the relative
luminance is low, making it difficult for an observer to recognize the
condition reliably in some cases. If the sun shines directly on the
surface of the traffic lights, such cases may take place actually. In
other words, if the sun is in a lower position as it rises or sets, the
sun light is incident upon the interior of the signal lamps and reflected,
thus presenting a condition that the traffic lights are misidentified as if 
the lights were on. This is the so-called false lighting phenomenon, which
is a subject that must be solved with respect to the signal lamps.As means for solving a false lighting phenomenon of the kind, there has
been known a shielding lens used for the signal lamps such as disclosed in
Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. Hei-3-54100. This prior
art is such that many numbers of cylindrical condenser lens elements having
a given curvature are arranged on the reverse side of lenses formed by a
translucent material, and at the same time, there are formed on the
surface side of the translucent lenses the diffuse lenses each of
converging sections of which is made a light transmission section
corresponding to each of the condenser lens elements, and that the
shielding lenses in which shielding films are coated between the diffuse
lenses are provided between the front lenses of the signal lamps and the
light sources. In other words, while the light from the electric bulb
serving as the light source is condensed by the condenser lens elements
for irradiation, the sun light is diffused in the interior of the signal
lamps by the diffuse lenses, at the same time being shielded by use of the
shielding films in order to prevent the false lighting from taking place.Nevertheless, in the shielding
