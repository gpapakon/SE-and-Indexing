<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for controlling local low-frequency electric and magnetic fields which are capable of acting on an electrically conducting structure being in a limited range, in particular an organic body such as a living being. The fields are neutralized by the generation of an interference field. Not only does this enable the harmful effects of such local fields to be avoided, but it also makes it possible to produce a desired action.

A device for controlling localised low-frequency electric and magnetic
alternating fields which have an effect on a conductive structure located within

a delimited volume of space, such as the organic substance of a living
organism, which has a pick-up device which picks up the fields within a

delimited volume of space in the form of field components oriented according
to a system of co-ordinates such as a Cartesian system, from which are then

derived the fields used for compensating the alternating fields,
characterised in that,

a measurement device is connected to the pick-up device, which is used for
determining amplitude, frequency and orientation of the field components

picked up by the pick-up device, in that a transmitter which uses a device to

generate an opposite field in the delimited volume of space is connected to
the measurement device by means of a control element, in that the frequency, 

the strength and the opposite field co-ordinate orientation of the control
element, the transmitter and the device which generates the opposite field can

be adjusted in accordance with the measured values from the measurement
device so that the opposite field generated in the delimited volume of space

interferes with the localised fields in such a way as almost approximately to
compensate for their effects on the conductive structure, and in that the

transmitter either uses the device connected to it to generate a further
oscillation field in the delimited volume of space with a frequency lower than

that of the opposite field used to compensate the localised fields with the
same concentration frequency, in particular an oscillation field with a

frequency value between approximately 1 Hz and approximately 8 Hz or
approximately 10 Hz and approximately 30 Hz, or that the frequency of the

transmitter is displaced in relation to the concentration frequency of the
localised fields by such a frequency value as to cause an interference

oscillation to be generated within the delimited volume of space, with the
interference oscillation being of a relatively low frequency in relation to the

concentration frequency of the localised fields, in particular, with a frequency
value between approximately 1 Hz and approximately 8 Hz or approximately

10 Hz and approximately 30 Hz.

are connected to the inputs of a multiplexer, and in that the multiplexer output
is, in a preferred embodiment, connected to the measurement device by

means of a filter branch such as a lowpass, which separates out the frequency
