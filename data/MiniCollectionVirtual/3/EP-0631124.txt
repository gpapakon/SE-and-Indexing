<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for carrying out an assay using a rotor 
assembly (220) comprising a rotor body (222) which is rotatable about 

an axis of rotation. The rotor body (222) has a central chamber (234) 
and six chambers (236 to 246) which are in communication with and 

radiate from the central chamber (234), and the rotor assembly (220) 
includes a shuttle (224) which is movable through said central chamber 

(234) into operative registry with any of said six chambers (236 to 
246). The shuttle (224) comprises a reaction cup (252) carrying an 

immobilized antigen or an immobilized antibody for transport among said 
chambers. The method involves introducing an amount of whole blood 

into the first chamber (238), wash solution into the second chamber 
(240), an enzyme conjugate into the fourth chamber (240), an enzyme 

substrate solution into the fifth chamber and a reagent reference into 
the sixth chamber. The third chamber (236) is used for drying. The 

shuttle is moved between the chambers in a specified manner, the rotor 
body being rotated at various stages in the process, and a product is 

generated in the fifth chamber for comparison with the reagent 
reference in the sixth chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The U.S. Government has rights in this invention 
pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC05-84OR21400 with Martin 
Marietta Energy Systems, Inc., awarded by the U.S. 
Department of Energy. This invention is a continuation-in-part application 
of 
U.S. Patent No. 4,835,106, 
issued May 30, 1989, and entitled ROTOR FOR PROCESSING 
LIQUIDS USING MOVABLE CAPILLARY TUBES. This invention relates generally to a rotor for 
processing liquids. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a rotor with which a number of bioanalytical 
processing steps can be automatically performed on a 
liquid and a method of using the rotor. Rotors for use during the processing of liquids are 
known. One such rotor, described in U.S. Patent 
3,901,658, discloses a rotor assembly for performing 
photometric analyses using whole blood samples. The 
rotor assembly includes a cell sedimentation bowl for  
 
centrifugally separating red blood cells from plasma. 
Following separation, the plasma is displaced from the 
sedimentation bowl, and measured sub-volumes are 
distributed to respective sample analyses cuvettes 
positioned in an angular array about the rotor periphery. 
Another rotor, described in U.S. Patent 4,515,889 is 
utilized for mixing and incubating a sample solution with 
at least one reagent and optically measuring a parameter 
in the incubated reaction mixture. Each step of mixing, 
incubating and measuring is carried out under the 
influence of centrifugal forces generated by the rotation 
of the rotor. Other examples of rotors are set forth in 
the referenced U.S. Patent No. 4,835,106 whose disclosure 
is incorporated herein by reference. Historically, the aliquoting of liquid samples and 
diluents for use in a rotor has been performed by hand 
prior to introduction of the aliquot within the rotor for 
a processing step. It would be desirable to provide a 
rotor wherein a measured amount of aliquot can be 
automatically separated from an excess amount of liquid 
introduced within the rotor without the use of capillary 
tubes, moving parts supported within the rotor or manual 
intervention of an analyst. In addition, transfer of liquids within the rotor 
from one chamber of the rotor to another for processing 
purposes has presented difficulties due to space 
limitations within the rotor which can be dedicated to 
transfer mechanisms. Hence, it would also be desirable 
to provide a rotor wherein liquid can be transferred from 
one character of the rotor to another without the use of 
transfer mechanisms internal of the rotor.

<CLAIMS>
A rotor assembly for processing a liquid comprising a rotor body 
(52) which is rotatable about an axis of rotation (R), said rotor body 

(52) comprising: 

a channel (116) having a first section for containing a liquid 
and a second section; 
a capillary tube (140) movably positioned within said channel 
(116), said capillary tube (140) having an end portion of a prescribed 

outer diameter; and 
a passageway opening (134) connecting said first and second 
sections of said channel (116), said passageway opening (134) being 

sized so that the surface tension of said liquid contained within said 
first section prevents the passage of said liquid through said 

passageway opening and so that said end portion of said capillary tube 
(140) is insertable through said passageway opening (134) and into said 

first section for extracting a sample of said liquid therefrom. 
A rotor assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said capillary 
tube (140) is positioned within said second section for movement 

therealong and into and out of said passageway opening (134). 
A rotor assembly as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
capillary tube (140) is slidably supported within said channel for 

movement therealong, and wherein said rotor assembly includes: 

magnetically-attractable material (142) associated with said 
capillary tube (140); and 
a magnetic field generating means for generating a magnetic field 
adjacent to said channel (116) so that a magnetic field generated by 

said magnetic field generating means acting upon said magnetically-attractable 
material (142) moves said capillary tube (140) along said 

channel (116).

any preceding claim, the method comprising the steps of: 


introducing an amount of liquid into said first section of said 
channel (116);  

 
inserting said end portion of said capillary tube (140) through 
said passageway opening (134) so that at least a portion of said amount 

of liquid contained within said first section is drawn into said 
capillary tube (140); and 
withdrawing said end portion of said capillary tube (140) from 
said passageway opening (134) for transport of said liquid to said 

second section. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said step of withdrawing 
is followed by the steps of: 


moving said capillary tube (140) to a position disposed generally 
between the axis of rotation (R) a
nd said second section; and 
rotating said rotor body (52) to centrifugally expel said liquid 
from said capillary tube (140) into said second section. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, which method is carried out using 
apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the step of moving said 

capillary tube (140) along the channel (116) includes the steps of: 

exposing said magnetically-attractable material (142) to a 
magnetic field; and 
moving said magnetic field along said channel (116) in the 
direction in which the capillary tube (140) is desired to be moved so 

that said magnetic field acting upon said magnetically-attractable 
material (142) moves said capillary tube (140) along said channel 

(116).
