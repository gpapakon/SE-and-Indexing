<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a high-pressure hydraulic valve, especially a pressure limiting valve in underground excavations, with a piston slide valve (9) movable in a valve bore and to which the hydraulic pressure medium is applied, having a thin, hard and smooth-surfaced coating on its outer circumference, on which slides a soft sealing ring (12) allocated to the valve bore (8). In order with such a high-pressure hydraulic valve to ensure that the piston slide valve (9) has a low coefficient of friction against the soft sealing material of the sealing ring (12), seals properly and has a long useful life even when pure water is used as the hydraulic pressure medium, the invention proposes that the coating consist of titanium nitride with a coating thickness of 1 to 4  mu m. Here, the body of the piston slide valve (9) preferably consists of a non-rusting alloy. The inner walls of the valve bore (8) may, if required, be coated with titanium nitride.

<CLAIMS>
A high-pressure hydraulic valve, in particular a pressure 
limiting valve for use in underground mining, comprising a plunger (9) 

which is displaceable in a valve bore (8) and which is acted upon by the 
hydraulic pressure medium and which at its outer periphery is provided 

with a thin hard coating (14) which is smooth at the surface, a soft 
sealing ring (12) which is associated with the valve bore sliding 

against the coating, characterised in that the coating (14) comprises 
titanium nitride with a layer thickness of from 1 to 4 Âµm. 
A valve according to claim 1 characterised in that the body of 
the plunger (9) comprises a non-corroding alloy. 
A valve according to claims 1 and 2 characterised in that the 
coating (14) extends over the entire outside surface of the plunger (9). 
A valve according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the valve bore (8) which accommodates the plunger (9) is disposed 

in a housing insert (7) which also comprises a non-corroding alloy. 
A valve according to claim 4 characterised in that the inside 
wall of the valve bore (8) is also provided with a coating of titanium 

nitride.
