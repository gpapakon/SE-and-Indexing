<ABSTRACT>
The disclosures relates to a susceptor for 
receiving and supporting a substrate during processing 

in a substrate processing chamber. The susceptor 
(236) includes a substrate receiving pocket (350) 

having a floor and generally upright sides. A 
circumscribing groove (354) is formed into the floor 

of the pocket and is dimensioned so that, when the 
substrate is received in the pocket, the groove lies 

at the perimeter of the substrate. The upright sides 
in conjunction with the groove operate to restrict 

substrate processing gas from reaching the underside 
of the substrate. The susceptor may further include a 

stepped formation (343), formed at its perimeter. The 
stepped formation interfaces with a complemental 

stepped formation (344) formed in a susceptor 
circumscribing preheat ring (340) located in the 

chamber and operates to restrict substrate processing 
gas from reaching the rear surface of the susceptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method and apparatus 
for depositing polysilicon onto silicon substrates. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a single substrate 
processing chamber for depositing a polysilicon layer having 
improved uniformity onto semiconductor substrates and method 
therefor. Doped or undoped silicon layers have been deposited onto 
silicon substrates, such as silicon wafers, using a low pressure 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. A reaction gas mixture 
including a source of silicon, such as silane, disilane, silicon 
tetrachloride and the like, and optionally a dopant gas such as 
phosphine, arsine, diborane and the like, and optionally 
including a carrier gas (such as hydrogen, argon, nitrogen or 
helium), is heated and passed over a silicon substrate to 
deposit a silicon film on the surface of the substrate. The 
exact crystallographic nature of the deposited silicon depends 
upon the temperature of deposition. At low reaction 
temperatures, the deposited silicon is mostly amorphous; when 
higher deposition temperatures are employed, a mixture of 
amorphous silicon and polysilicon or polysilicon alone will be 
deposited. The prior art methods use comparatively low pressures of 
about 26.7 to 53.3 Pa (200-400 millitorr) for this process. 
Good quality films can be formed, but very low deposition rates  
 
of about 100 angstroms/min for undoped, and about 30 
angstroms/min for doped, polysilicon are obtained. This low 
deposition rate can be overcome by processing a plurality of 
wafers, i.e., up to 100, at once in a batch-type processing 
chamber. However, present day thin film equipment for the 
semiconductor industry has been moving toward single substrate 
processing, because the processing chambers can be made smaller 
and processing can be better controlled. Further, modern 
semiconductor vacuum processing systems have been developed to 
carry out more than one processing step on a substrate without 
removing the substrate from a vacuum environment. The use of 
such vacuum systems results in a reduced number of particulates 
that contaminate the surface of the wafers during processing, 
thereby improving the device yield. Such vacuum systems include 
a central robotic transfer chamber connected to various 
processing chambers, such as the Applied Materials 5000 series 
processing system described in US Patent 4,951,601 to Maydan et 
al. Thus CVD equipment for single substrate processing to 
deposit polysilicon onto semiconductor substrates are coming
