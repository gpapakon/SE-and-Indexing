<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a ferroelectric material film, more 
particularly a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) film by the sol-gel 

method wherein a lowered oxidative sintering temperature may be 
adopted in preparing the ferroelectric material film with a 

perovskite crystalline structure, thereby reducing the risk of 
oxidation of metal electrodes and other circuits when the 

ferroelectric material film is employed as a dielectric in 
semiconductor devices, such as in a capacitor, for example. The 

method contemplates the preparation of a raw material solution 
containing an organometallic compound of a metallic element forming 

the ferroelectric material film, alkanolamine and/or stabilizer 
comprising a β-diketone, with the concentration of the stabilizer 

being sufficient to provide a mole ratio to the total metal atoms 
of (stabilizer/total metal atoms) 
>
 3. The method then involves 
coating the raw material solution, drying the coated raw material 

solution to form a dried film, and sintering the dried film to form 
the ferroelectric material film wherein the oxidative sintering is 

carried out at a relatively low temperature of about 450°C in 
forming the ferroelectric material film with a perovskite 

crystalline structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method for forming a 
ferroelectric material film (particularly, a lead zirconate 
titanate (PZT) film) by the sol-gel method, along with a process 
for the production of a capacitor (particularly a capacitor for a 
semiconductor memory cell) and its raw material solution. For example, as an insulation film (dielectric film) for a 
capacitor of a memory call of a dynamic RAM an ONO film having a 
structure with SiO₂, Si₃N₄ and SiO₂ layers laminated in this order 
is used. However, the effective specific inductive capacity of this ONO 
film is about 5, which is small, and in the case of applications to 
large-capacity memories over 254 Mb, there are significant 
processing difficulties such as requirements for a low thickness of 
the capacitor's dielectric film under restrictions with respect to 
the area, a complex structure needed to expand the area, etc. On the other hand, in the case of ferroelectric materials with 
a perovskite crystalline structure, the specific inductive capacity 
is extremely large, in a range of several hundreds to several 
thousands; consequently, they are noted as insulation film material 
for a capacitor of dynamic RAM devices to be used in the future. To form a film of PZT represented by Pb(Zr,Ti)O₂ among those 
ferroelectric materials, the use of the sol-gel method, which is 
one of the methods for thin film preparation, has been known 
previously. The method for forming a Pb(Zr,Ti)O₂ film by the sol-gel 
method is explained by referring to Figure 12 as follows. First of all, in the work unit 1, a sol-gel raw material 
solution as a precursor is prepared through metal alkoxide  
 
hydrolysis and polycondensation. It is coated on a substrate using, 
for example, the spin coating method or dip coating method in the 
work unit 2. Subsequently the coated film is dried at a 
temperature of 100-300°C in the work unit 3 to obtain a 
sol-gel thin film in its dried gel state (polymer gel). Subsequently in the work unit 4, the oxidative sintering 
treatment of the dried film is carried out in a high-temperature 
oxygen atmosphere at 600°C or above to complete the process through 
conversion of the dried gel thin film to a thin film of Pb(Zr,Ti)O₂ 
having a perovskite crystalline structure. As a sol-gel raw material solution for Pb(Zr,Ti)O₂, the 
previously used solution is one made of Pb(CH₃COO)₂·3H₂O (lead 
acetate), Ti(i-OC₃H₇)₄ (titanium isopropoxide), Zr(i-OC₃H₇)₄ 
(zirconium isopropoxide) and a stabilizer, NH(C₃H₄OH)₂ 
(diethanolamine, abbreviated as
