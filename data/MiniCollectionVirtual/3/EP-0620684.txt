<ABSTRACT>
Simulcasting from a television transmitter facility of 
both NTSC video signals, via a UHF/VHF portion of the 

broadcast spectrum, and digital HDTV signals, over a 
prescribed UHF portion of the broadcast spectrum, by 

converting the NTSC video signals into digital format at 
the television studio and multiplexing the digitally 

formatted NTSC signals and digital HDTV signals into a 
combined NTSC/HDTV digital television signal, which 

vision signal is transmitted over a common microwave 
radio frequency communication channel linking the 

television studio with the television transmitter 
facility. The combined NTSC/HDTV digital television 

signal is demultiplexed into separate HDTV and NTSC video 
digital signals. The digital NTSC video signals are 

converted into analog NTSC format, and the NTSC video 
signals and the HDTV signals are simulcast from the 

television transmitter facility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to television 
broadcasting systems and in particular to a communication 
bandwidth conservation mechanism for conveying both NTSC 
and HDTV channels over a single microwave communication 
link between a television broadcasting studio sourcing 
the NTSC and HDTV signals and a broadcast transmission 
facility (tower) from which the respective television 
signals are broadcast for reception by customer sites. Television broadcast studios currently employ 
NTSC-signalling format for the broadcast of television 
programming. Because the transmission facility 
(typically a microwave transmission tower) from which the 
television signals are broadcast (via VHF and/or UHF 
channels) over a customer service area is customarily 
located away from the television studio, a (microwave) 
radio link is provided between the television studio and 
the tower, so that the NTSC-formatted television 
programming may be forwarded from the studio to the 
tower. In some circumstances, an auxiliary return channel 
from the tower to the television studio, which is coupled 
to a satellite downlink at the tower facility, may be 
provided. With the advent of and continued industry impetus, 
and consumer demand for high definition television  
 
(HDTV), it will take an introductory period for the 
simulcasting (simultaneous broadcasting) of HDTV and 
NTSC- based programming (which may include separate 
programs for each format), with an eventual phase-out 
replacement of the NTSC standard by an HDTV standard 
(broadcast on UHF channels), exclusively. 
Accordingly, additional bandwidth to the microwave link 
will be employed for the transmission of HDTV channels 
from the television studio to the tower. Because 
bandwidth conservation is a high government priority, and 
the time and expense of adding additional channel 
capability equipment for only a limited change-over 
interval are major concerns of television broadcasting 
service providers, the allocation of previously reserved 
bandwidth from the regulated communication spectrum is 
considered to be a less than ideal way to solve the 
problem. The present invention includes a method of 
transmitting NTSC video signals and digital HDTV signals, 
from a television studio sourcing each of said NTSC video 
and digital HDT signals,over a common microwave 
communication channel to a  
 
television transmitter facility for broadcast therefrom 
to customer sites comprising the steps of and 
characterized by,
