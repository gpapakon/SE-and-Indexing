<ABSTRACT>
A solid state seed crystal process for bulk 
conversion of a polycrystalline ceramic body to a 

single crystal body (of the same chemical composition) 
having the same crystal orientation as the seed 

crystal. The process comprises heating said body to 
form a monolithic join between the body and the seed 

crystal, heating the joined structure to reduce grain 
growth inhibitors and further heating the joined 

structure above the minimum temperature required for 
crystallite growth of the crystalline material, but not 

hot enough to melt and distort the original shape of 
the polycrystalline ceramic body during its conversion 

to a single crystal. This process has been used to 
convert polycrystalline alumina (PCA) bodies to 

sapphire having the same crystal orientation as the 
seed crystal by heating the PCA body, monolithically 

joined to a sapphire seed crystal, at a temperature 
above 1700°C without melting the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid state process for
bulk conversion of a polycrystalline alumina (PCA) body
to sapphire using a sapphire seed crystal monolithically
joined to the PCA body and heating said body to a
temperature above 1100°C, but below the approximately
2050°C melting temperature for alpha alumina for a time
sufficient to convert the PCA body to sapphire having the
same crystal orientation as the seed crystal.JP-A-63117985 discloses a process wherein a
polycrystalline material containing boron oxide joined to
a single crystal having the same or similar composition
is heated to convert to polycrystalline material to a
monocrystal. The manufacture of polycrystalline alumina (PCA),
and its use for high pressure sodium arc discharge
lamps (hereinafter "HPS lamps") is well known and old
to those skilled in the art. U.S. Patents 3,026,210,
4,150,317 and 4,285,732, respectively, to Coble, Laska
et al and Charles et al, disclose the production of a
high density PCA body having improved visible light
transmission using relatively pure alumina powder and
small amounts of magnesia. U.S. Patent 4,285,732
further teaches adding zirconia and hafnia to the
magnesia-doped alumina to reduce the chances of
precipitating a spinel phase and exaggerated or run
away grain growth during sintering. PCA bodies useful
as arc tubes for HPS lamps have been made according to
the processes in these patents having an average grain
size ranging from between 15 microns to 100 microns.Two major drawbacks associated with the use of PCA
arc tubes for HPS lamps are that they are light
translucent as opposed to light transparent and the
sodium in the arc reacts with the alumina at the grain
boundaries to form sodium aluminate, which shortens
lamp life. HPS lamps are being designed for increased
internal sodium partial pressure within the PCA arc
tube to improve the color rendition and provide white
emitted light. However, higher internal sodium
pressure further shortens lamp life due to increased
rate of sodium loss from the arc chamber. Progressive
sodium loss results in a continual rise in the lamp
operating voltage, decrease of both correlated color
temperature and color rendering index, and a color
shift from white to pink. Also, the sodium which 
migrates through the arc chamber wall deposits on the
inside wall of the evacuated outer lamp envelope
causing a brownish stain on the envelope which, in
turn, further reduces the light output of the lamp.
These problems are substantially reduced with sapphire
(i.e., single

A solid state process for bulk conversion of a
solid PCA body comprising partially sintering the PCA

body, placing a solid sapphire seed crystal in contact
with the partially sintered PCA body in a position in

which further sintering of the PCA body will cause
pressure between said PCA body and said seed crystal so

as to monolithically join said seed crystal to said PCA
body, further sintering said PCA body until said PCA body

has a density no less than 3.9g/cc and thereafter heating
said PCA body with said seed crystal to a temperature

said PCA body does not contain grain growth inhibitors in

an amount which would prevent grain growth.
