<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an infrared detector
as defined in the precharacterizing part of claim 1. Further, it relates to an infrared imager.Detection of infrared radiation emitted by warm bodies provides an
important method for night vision (perception without visible light).
Infrared detectors are of various types and include small bandgap semiconductors
structured as photodiodes or photocapacitors. Alloys of mercury
telluride and cadmium telluride, generically denoted Hg1-xCdxTe,
are extensively employed as the photosensitive semiconductor in such
detectors. Indeed, Hg0.8Cd0.2Te has a bandgap of about 0.1 eV, and a
0.1 eV photon has a wavelength of 12 µm; whereas, Hg0.73Cd0.27Te has
a bandgap of about 0.24 eV, and a 0.24 eV photon has a wavelength of
5 µm. These two wavelengths are in the two atmospheric windows of
greatest interest for infrared detectors.An infrared imager incorporating an array of MIS photocapacitor detectors
in Hg1-xCdxTe is disclosed in U.S.Pat.No. 4,684,812 (Tew and
Lewis). Figures 1a-b are cross sectional
elevation and plan views of a single photocapacitor and illustrate
the transparent nickel gate. There is a tradeoff between transmittance
and electrical conductivity of the nickel gate, and typically the transmittance
of 10 µm wavelength photons is 50-60% with a sheet resistance of 
100-200 Ω/□. Transmittance as high as 75% has been demonstrated but
the nickel film becomes so thin (about 50 Å) that discontinuities begin
to appear and manufacture becomes difficult. Further, manufacture of
Hg1-xCdxTe containing devices requires processing temperatures below
200° C to avoid decomposition of the Hg1-xCdxTe, and this aggravates
discontinuity problems. But the trend for infrared imagers is to a transmittance
of at least 70%; and even thinner nickel gates will be called
for.Thus it is a problem of the known infrared transparent gates to simultaneously
achieve high transmittance, high electrical conductivity,
and manufacturability. According to the invention an infrared detector of the type
described above comprises the features of the characterizing
part of claim 1.The present invention provides materials with high infrared transmittance
for relatively thick films having moderate resistivity
including bismuth and antimony.
The invention also provides infrared detectors using these
materials as gates for photocapacitors. The drawings are schematic for clarity.
Figures 1a-b are cross sectional elevation and plan views of a prior
art infrared photocapacitive detector.Figures
