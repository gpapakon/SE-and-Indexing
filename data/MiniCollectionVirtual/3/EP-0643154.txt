<ABSTRACT>
A composition for treating surfaces of copper and 
copper alloys comprising a specific imidazole derivative 

and water, and an acid or a water-soluble solvent. The 
composition can produce a heat resistant organic film 

with superior solderability when applied to surfaces of 
copper or copper alloys. It is particularly useful as a 

rust preventing agent for printed-wiring boards.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for 
treating surfaces of copper and copper alloys comprising 
a specific imidazole derivative, and to a method for 
treating surfaces of copper and copper alloys using this 
composition. The composition of the present invention is 
particularly useful as a rust preventing agent for 
printed-wiring boards. There are two methods for preventing rust in a 
circuit formed from copper or a copper alloy on a 
printed-wiring board and for maintaining good 
solderability. One is a method of covering the circuit 
with another metal and the other is a method of coating 
the circuit with organic films. Either of the two 
methods is used depending on the allowable cost, 
requirements for surface smoothness, and the like. Examples of materials which form the organic film 
used in the last-mentioned method include a rosin-type 
coating material, which coats the entire printed-wiring 
board, and an alkylimidazole-type coating material which 
forms a film by a chemical reaction selectively on the  
 
copper circuit section. The rosin-type coating material is used in a method 
for forming a film by coating, spraying, or soaking the 
entire printed-wiring board with a solution of a natural 
rosin, a rosin ester, a rosin-modified maleic acid resin, 
or the like, in an organic solvent, and then drying. 
However, this method involves a problem of impairing the 
working environment and the safety because of 
volatilization of the organic solvent. The treating 
plant must be provided with special equipment such as 
draft for air discharge. Therefore, there have been desires for the use of 
water-soluble alkylimidazole-type coating materials which 
are excellent materials from the aspect of keeping a good 
working environment and safety. Films made from 
alkylimidazole-type coating materials, however, 
deteriorate when subjected to a high temperature, 
hindering the action of a postflux which is used during 
soldering and thus giving a rise to the drawback of poor 
solderability. In recent years, a surface mounting method has 
become the most commonly used method for joining 
electronic parts on printed-wiring boards. This 
increases opportunities wherein printed-wiring boards are 
exposed to high temperatures, e.g., temporary mounting of  
 
the parts, reflow of solder pastes, and the like. For 
this reason, a water-soluble type surface treatment agent 
which has high heat resistance and exhibits excellent 
solderability, even when the printed-wiring boards have 
been exposed to
