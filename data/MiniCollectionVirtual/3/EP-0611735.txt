<ABSTRACT>
There is described a dry stucco mortar mixture containing gypsum or gypsum-lime as binder and an amount of round glass granules and also aggregates and floating agents, with the round glass granules having fine pores and being present in an amount of from 0.5 to 5% by weight and having a particle size of from 0.25 to 1 mm. It further contains from 3 to 12% by weight of a mixture of pearlite, limestone meal and/or limestone grit, and contains aggregates matching the fine-pored round glass granules according to a particle size distribution curve directed at a high degree of filling (filler content). The proportion by weight of the gypsum or gypsum-lime binder is from 40 to 95% by weight.

<CLAIMS>
A dry plaster mixture with gypsum or gypsum-lime as binder and a proportion 
of a round granulate of glass, as well as additives and adulterants, characterized in that 

the round granulate of glass is fine-pored and is present in an amount from 0.5 to 5% 
by weight and with a grain size or 0.25 to 1 mm, in that it further contains 3 to 12% 

by weight of a mixture of perlite, limestone powder and/or limestone grit, and in that 
it contains additives which are matched to the fine-pored round granulate of glass in 

accordance with a grading curve providing a high degree of incorporation, and the 
proportion by weight of the binder of gypsum or gypsum-lime amounts to 40 to 95% 

by weight. 
A plaster mixture according to claim 1, characterized in that the proportion of 
fine-pored round granulate of glass amounts to 1.5 to 4% by weight. 
A plaster mixture according to claim 1 and 2, characterized in that the additives 
are limestone powder or limestone grit and perlite in an amount of up to 6.5% by 

weight. 
A plaster mixture according to claim 1 to 3, characterized in that the gypsum is 
beta hemihydrate, optionally with a proportion of alpha hemihydrate, and originates 

from flue gas desulphurisation. 
A plaster mixture according to claim 1, characterized in that the binder further 
contains a proportion of anhydrite. 
A plaster mixture according to claim 1 to 5, characterized in that the plaster 
mixture contains adulterants such as retardants, surface-active agents, thickeners and 

materials for improving water retention. 
A plaster mixture according to claim 1 to 6, characterized in that the surface-active 
agent is a fatty alcohol sulphate, preferably sodium lauryl sulphate.  

 
A dry plaster mixture with gypsum or gypsum-lime as binder and a proportion 
of a round granulate of glass as well as additives and adulterants, characterized in that 

the round granulate of glass is fine-pored and is present in an amount of 5% by weight 
and with a grain size of 0.25 to 1 mm and contains 40% by weight Î² gypsum, 10% by 

weight hydrated lime as well as 46% by weight limestone grit, likewise with graduated 
grain sizes, and adulterants. 
A method of making a dry plaster mixture according to claim 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the amount provided of fine-pored granulate of glass is initially 

mixed with the surface-active agent in a separate mixing operation, and then the 
remaining components are added and the mixing operation is carried out sufficiently 

long for substantial homogeneity of the mixture to be attained.
