<ABSTRACT>
This cloth consists of a textile of 
synthetic fiber, having (1) a base texture of 

single plain woven or twill-fabric structure, 
and (2) a plurality of textures having a higher 

air permeability than that of the base texture, 
and including: a) a silky-woven texture having 

pin holes; b) a double plain-woven texture; 
or c) a double twill-woven texture. When an 

air bag is manufactured by using this cloth, it 
is possible to freely lay out a cutting and set 

cutting portions. Also, in inflating the air bag, 
it is possible to flow out part of the inflation gas 

instantaneously in order to ensure the safety of 
the crew.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter cloth for
air bags for automobiles and aircrafts. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a filter
cloth for air bags having a plurality of high gas-permeability
structure segments substantially evenly
distributed and formed in a high density ground structure
segment. The air bag produced from the filter cloth
allows, when a large amount of inflation is blown into
the air bag, a portion of the inflation gas to instantly
flow to the outside of the bag through the high gas-permeability
structure segments, to thereby enhance the
safety of an occupant of the vehicle, and enhances the
resistance of the air bag to seam slippage.The performance requirements for a filter cloth for
air bags are as follows.
1 ○ The woven fabric, from which an air bag is
formed, should have a relatively high gas permeability
and, when an automobile or aircraft collides and an
inflation gas is introduced into the air bag, the air bag
can allow a portion of the inflation gas to substantially
evenly flow out so as to lower the gas temperature, to
thereby prevent burning of an occupant by the inflation
gas introduced into the air bag.2 ○ The filter cloth should appropriately filter a
large mount of the fine particles contained in the
inflation gas and maintain the air in the inside of the
automobile or aircraft clean even after the inflation of
the air bag.3 ○ After inflation, the air bag should be quickly
deflated by discharging the inflation gas so as to not
constrain the occupant.As filter cloth for air bags meeting the above 
requirements, the following prior arts are been known.
U.S. Patent No. 4,840,397 for Katz et al. discloses an
air bag device for a motorcar provided with a filter for
cleaning an inflation gas. The filter is formed from a
filter cloth which consists of a 2/1 twill weave made
from aramid fiber spun yarns. This woven fabric has a
single weaving structure and exhibits a high gas-permeability.However, this filter cloth exhibits a poor
resistance to seam slippage due to the single weaving
structure having a high gas-permeability. Thus, when an
inflation gas is blown into an air bag made from the
filter cloth, the inflation gas can be discharged only
through very small gaps formed between weaving yarns and
distributed throughout the filter cloth. Accordingly,
the filter cloth exhibits an unsatisfactory gas-discharging
property and thus the air bag exhibits an
unsatisfactory deflating property.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-16,853
