<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a novel capsule for 
protecting sensitive ingredients in detergent compositions. 

The capsule, in addition to a protected sensitive ingredient, 
contains an oil dispersion containing the active and a 

polymer shell surrounding the dispersion. The oil is defined 
by its ability to meet a tripartite definition and the shell 

is a water soluble or water dispersible polymer as defined. 
The invention further relates to liquid detergent 

compositions containing such capsules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel capsule capable of
protecting sensitive active ingredients (e.g., enzymes,
peracid bleaches or bleach catalysts) in liquid detergent
compositions and to liquid detergent compositions comprising
the capsules.It is well known in the art that liquid detergents may
provide a hostile environment to sensitive ingredients (e.g.,
enzymes, peracid bleach, bleach catalysts or perfumes) used
in these detergents. For example, enzymes are subject to
attack by, anionic actives, high pH conditions and/or by
other enzymes. Bleaches, in particular peracid bleaches
(such as taught in U.S. Patent 4,909,953 and WO/90,14,336,
for example), are known to be particularly harsh on enzyme
components. Encapsulation has been used to protect these
sensitive ingredients in liquid detergent.One approach to protecting these sensitive ingredients is to
in fact use a polymer shell surrounding the active component
to protect the component. This approach has been used, for
example, in GB 1,390,503 to Unilever; in EP 266,796 to Showa
Denko; and in U.S. Patent No. 4,777,089 (Lion Corp.).While such an approach has been effective in protecting
active components such as enzyme or enzymes from being 
attacked by other enzymes or harsh surfactants, this type of
capsule does not provide an effective barrier to protect the
component from being attacked by bleach. Bleach molecules
can penetrate rapidly through the polymer coating and
interact with the sensitive ingredient.In patent applications WO-A-9322417,
applicants teach an encapsulating polymer
system comprising a hydrophilic water soluble polymer or
polymers chemically or physically attached to a hydrophobic
polymer core particles. Although these applications teach a
kind of "web-like" capsule created by the hydrophilic
molecules entangling and forming an encapsulating net over
the core, this "net" is still too porous to protect the
active component, particularly when the liquid composition is
a bleach containing liquid compositionAnother method which has been used to protect active
components from the liquid medium is to place the active in a
hydrophobic oil such that the active is protected by the oil
from diffusing into the composition where it is subject to
degradative attack.Each of U.S. Patent 4,906,396 to Falholt et al.; EP 356,239
to Allied Colloid; and EP 273,775, for example, provide
enzymes protected by hydrophobic oils.The use of a hydrophobic oil alone, however, does not provide
sufficient protection, particularly when the composition
