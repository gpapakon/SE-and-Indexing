<ABSTRACT>
Dry or quasi-dry purificn. of flue gas (I) from waste incineration, esp. sepn. of acid constituents, e.g. HCl and S cpds., e.g. SO2, involves adding neutralising agent (II) contg. Ca, CaO or Ca(OH)2. The actual impurity content and vol. flow of (I) is determined before purificn. and the amt. of (II) to be added is calculated from equation (A): mn=F*((0.97*Chcl*100/Ccl-.i.r)-Chcl-0.84*Cso2- Cdust)*V*10-6 (A) In (A): mn is the (II) dosage in kg/hr.; Ccl-.i.r is the chloride content of the reaction prod. (III) in wt.%; F is a factor for Ca(OH)2 which is equal to 1 and for CaO is equal to 0.76; Chcl, Cso2 and Cdust are the HCl, SO2 and dust concn. respectively in (I), all in mg/m3; and V is the vol. flow of (I) in m3/hr..

Process for the dry or virtually dry purification 
of hydrogen chloride-containing flue gas from waste 

incineration by removal of hydrogen chloride or hydrogen 
chloride and other acid constituents such as sulphur 

compounds from the flue gas, with addition of lime-containing 
neutralizing agents, characterized in that 

the actual values of the pollutant content of the flue 
gas and also its volume flow are determined prior to 

purification and that the respective amount of 
neutralizing agent, preferably of Ca(OH)
2
, to be added is 
determined in accordance with the relationship

Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the determination of the actual values and the 

feeding in of the neutralizing agent assigned to the 
actual values are carried out automatically. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the amount of lime to be added as neutralizing 

agent is metered in in such a way that the reaction  
 

product of the flue gas purification has a chloride 
content of from 14 to 25% by mass, preferably from 16 to 

20% by mass, and also a Ca(OH)

 content of from 5 to 25% 
by mass, preferably from 10 to 20% by mass, and that the 

ratio of HCl to SO

is greater than 0.8, preferably greater than 1. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that, to maintain the required ratio of HCl/SO

, chlorine 
compounds, e.g. as HCl, are added to the waste to be 

incinerated and/or the flue gas prior to its purification. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that, to maintain the required ratio of HCl/SO

be incinerated and/or the flue gas prior to its purification. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the amount of neutralizing 

agent fed in is modified according to the concentration
