<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel-injection
control device for a diesel engine,
particularly to a fuel-injection control device for a
diesel engine using a common-rail-type fuel-injection
pump, and in more detail to an optimum control device for
the combination between a fuel-injection control and EGR
(Exhaust Gas Recirculation) control in a diesel engine
using a common-rail-type fuel-injection pump.A common-rail-type fuel-injection pump (also
referred hereinafter to "a common-rail-type pump") has
recently been developed, which is constructed to inject
pressurized fuel from a reservoir, i.e., a so-called
common-rail and allows the pressure of the injected fuel
to be arbitrarily set and controlled in relation to
engine operating conditions such as engine speed, engine
load, etc. (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publications No. 62-75025 and No; 2-191865). A variety
of advantageous methods have been contrived for applying
such a common-rail-type fuel-injection pump to a diesel
engine. For example, there have been proposed the
methods for its utilization such as: the pressure of
injected fuel is controlled according to an operating
state of the engine and the timing and the interval of
fuel-injection are also controlled according to an
operating state of the engine (see, for example, Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 62-645); the pressure
of injected fuel is controlled on the basis of an engine
load (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publications No. 62-75025 above-mentioned and
No. 63-50649); and so on.On the other hand, in the purification of 
exhaust gas of a diesel engine, the engine cannot use a
three-way reducing and oxidizing catalyst converter as in
a gasoline engine, due to its excess air ratio, but it
uses an EGR control for reducing NOx emissions.
Practical techniques have yet been elucidated for
minimizing the emissions of exhaust gases particularly in
the case of combining the fuel-injection control using
such a common-rail-type pump with the EGR control. For
example, even though the EGR control is simply added to
the technique of increasing the pressure of injected fuel
as the engine load is increased as described in the
above-mentioned Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No. 62-75025, it will be impossible to produce the
minimum amount of NOx, black smoke, PM (Particulate
Matter), etc. emissions.Furthermore, specially in a diesel engine using
the EGR control, it is necessary to stop the EGR control
when the engine is cold in order to prevent the
