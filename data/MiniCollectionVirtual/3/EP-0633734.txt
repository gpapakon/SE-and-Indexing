<ABSTRACT>
A sweetened extruded food product based on a vegetable material containing sweetener incorporated before extrusion, is formulated so that the sweetener comprises a significant proportion of sucralose. In particular, the sucralose provides at least 50 %, preferably at least 75 % of the sweetness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of 
sweetened extruded food products such as breakfast 
cereals and snack foods containing the high intensity 
sweetener sucralose 
(1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-β-D-fructofuranosyl 
4-chloro-4--deoxy-(α-D-galactopyranoside). The use of 
sucralose as a high intensity sweetener in sweetening 
compositions, ingestible products and oral compositions 
is disclosed in British Patent No. 1,543,167. By an "extruded food product" we mean a cooked, 
extruded food product based on edible vegetable 
materials comprising or derived from cereals, legumes, 
tubers, nuts, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The 
term includes human foods and animal feeds and further 
includes both finished food products and also food 
ingredients such as textured vegetable protein products. 
By a "breakfast cereal" there is meant an extruded food 
product based on cereals such as corn, wheat and oats, 
and mixtures thereof, usually eaten with milk, for 
example corn flakes. By a "snack food" there is meant a 
ready to eat extruded food product based on edible 
vegetable materials as mentioned above, such as a 
flavoured cereal snack or potato sticks.  
 Conventional sweetened extruded food products such 
as breakfast cereals and snack foods often have a high 
sugar content, comprising a wide variety of 
monosaccharides and disaccharides including sucrose, 
high fructose corn syrups (HFCS), dextrose, fructose, 
maltose, lactose and mixtures thereof. The sugar is 
important as a source of sweetness, bulk and texture as 
well as enhancing the flavour of such foods and 
providing an easily digestible source of energy. The 
sugar may be incorporated in the extruded product and/or 
may be coated thereon. There is considerable interest in foodstuffs with a 
reduced sugar content amongst consumers who wish to 
reduce their intake of sugars and to consume a higher 
proportion of carbohydrates in the form of starch and 
dietary fibre. Other consumers, such as diabetics, 
require sugar-free foods. One way in which manufacturers have responded to the 
desire for foods with a reduced sugar content has been 
to replace some or all of the sugar with a high 
intensity sweetener. Generally this has proved 
difficult for products such as breakfast cereals and 
snack foods which traditionally depend upon sugars to 
provide properties such as bulk, texture, viscosity and 
flavour enhancement, as well as sweetness.  
 Hitherto, high intensity sweeteners have not been 
incorporated during the manufacture of sweetened 
ex

<CLAIMS>
A sweetened cooked extruded food product based on a 
vegetable material containing sweetener incorporated 

before extrusion, characterised in that the sweetener 
comprises a significant proportion of sucralose. 
A food product according to Claim 1, in which the 
sucralose provides at least 50% of the total sweetness. 
A food product according to Claim 2, in which the 
sucralose provides at least 75% of the sweetness. 
A food product according to Claim 1, in which the 
sucralose content is from 0.01% to 0.2% by weight. 
A food product according to Claim 3, having a bulk 
density of from 45 to 75% that of an equivalent product 

using an all-sugar sweetener. 
A process for manufacturing a sweetened cooked extruded 
food product comprising cooking a mixture of vegetable 

material, water and sweetener in a cooking extruder and extruding the cooked 
mixture as pellets or other shaped pieces, and, where 

necessary, drying them to a desired moisture content, 
characterised in that the sweetener comprises a 

significant proportion of sucralose.  
 
A process according to Claim 6, in which the 
sucralose provides at least 50% of the sweetness 

provided by the sweetener. 
A process according to Claim 7, in which the 
sucralose provides at least 75% of the sweetness 

provided by the sweetener. 
A process according to Claim 6, in which the 
sucralose content in the product is from 0.01% to 0.2% 

by weight.
