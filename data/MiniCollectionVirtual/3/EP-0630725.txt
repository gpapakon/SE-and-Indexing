<ABSTRACT>
An installation for the production of particle boards or fibre boards has a pressing drum (1) and an endless steel belt (2) which encloses the drum (1) on a part of its circumference and thereat forms a pressing zone (P) in which introduced, chipped or fibrised, lignocellulose or cellulose material provided with thermo-hardening binder is compressed and set over a sufficiently long time by the action of pressure and temperature. The pressing pressure and the heating-up are produced by extended pressure shoes (10, 13, 14, 15) with a hydrostatic bearing pocket (11) supplied with hot pressure oil, the pressing drum (1) being equipped with a rotationally fixed carrier (19) and a shell (20) rotatable about the latter and supported by means of supporting elements (21) supplied with hot pressure oil, so that simultaneously the shell (20) is heated up and adjustable pressing forces are produced without bearing loading, with a uniform even gap.

<CLAIMS>
An equipment for the continuous production of chipboard, fibreboard
or the like from comminuted lignocellulose- or cellulose-containing

raw material (5) which is mixed with a pressure-setting and/or thermo-setting
binder, the said equipment having a heatable pressure-drum (1)

and an endless metallic pressure-belt (2) which is led over guiderolls
and encloses the pressure-drum (1) over part of its circumference to form

a pressure section (P) for the material to be compressed, which is heated
above the setting temperature of the binder, at least one pressure equipment

(10, 13, 14, 15) being provided, to act with a certain superficial
pressure upon the pressure belt (1), characterized in that the

pressure-drum (1) exhibits a non-rotating bearer (19) and a jacket (20)
rotatable with respect to the latter and supported by at least one supporting

element (21) with adjustable supporting force, the supporting
equipment being a hydrostatic bearing zone (H) which is filled with pressure

liquid and arranged at the pressure side of the pressure-drum and
formed as a segment of the annular space between the inner surface of the

drum (20) and the bearer (19).
An equipment as in Claim 1, characterized in that
the pressure equipment is created at least at the side of entry into

the pressure section, by a pressure-shoe (10) having a hydraulic bearing
area (11) and forming with the pressure-drum (1) a gradually narrowing

entry zone (E) and a succeeding region extending as the pressure section
(P) over a certain arc of the pressure-drum (1) at approximately uniform

pressure and/or distance from the pressure-drum.
An equipment as in Claim 2, characterized in that
in the pressure section (P) directly adjacent to the pressure-shoe

(13, 14, 15) is arranged, having a hydraulic bearing area with
adjustable pressure.
An equipment as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that in the pressure section (P) after the last pressure-shoe (15)

a shaper-roll (16) is arranged, which exerts upon the pressure-belt (2)
a higher pressure than the last pressure-shoe (15).
An equipment as in Claim 4, characterized in that
the shaper-roll (6) exhibits a non-rotating bearer (16) and 

a jacket (17) rotatable with respect to the latter and supported by at
least one supporting equipment (18) with adjustable supporting force.
An equipment as in Claim 5, characterized in that
the shaper-roll (6) exhibits a number of supporting elements (18)

arranged side by side in the axial direction and having individually
adjustable supporting force.
An equipment as in Claim 5, characterized in that
the shaper-roll (6) is adjustable in the direction of motion of the

pressure-belt (2).
An equipment as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the shaper-roll (6) exhibits at its pressure side a part-space,

especially a half-space (h) which is sealed by sealing strips (24)
and may be filled with pressure fluid.
