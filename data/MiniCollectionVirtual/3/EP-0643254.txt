<ABSTRACT>
The reservoir (container) for storing gas under high pressure includes a casing part (2B) which is not insulated, and a casing part (2A) which is insulated, the two parts (2A, 2B) being connected by an insulated passage (18) insulated from the casing parts, the non-insulated part (2B) defining a gaseous overhead (ceiling) making it possible to limit instantaneous pressure drops when liquid in the insulated part (2A) is being drawn off continuously in order to alleviate the response time of an external heating circuit for maintaining the pressure. Application particularly to the back-up installations of a primary source for producing high-pressure gas.

Reservoir for storing gas at a high pressure, 
characterized in that it comprises a first part (I) having 

means (3; P, 10) for maintaining it at a first temperature, a 
second part (S) having means for maintaining it at a second 

temperature distinctly higher than the first temperature, and 
at least one passage (18) establishing free fluid 

communication between the first (I) and second (S) parts of 
the reservoir and associated with means (17; 22; P) limiting 

heat transfer between the parts of the reservoir. 
Reservoir according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
first part of the reservoir (I) is thermally insulated and the 

second part of the reservoir (S) is not insulated. 
Reservoir according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in 
that the second part of the reservoir (S) is supported by the 

first part of the reservoir (I). 
Reservoir according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the passage (18) is thermally insulated (17; 21, 22) 

from the adjacent portions of the first (I) and second (S) 
parts of the reservoir. 
Reservoir according to one of claims 3 and 4, characterized 
in that the central passage (18) is defined by an inner 

structure (19) extending (19A, 19B) into the first (I) and 
second (S) parts of the reservoir. 
Reservoir according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first part of the reservoir (I) has 

a first outlet (7) and encloses a section of a line (8) 
emerging either side of the exterior of the first part (I) and 

incorporating a heat exchanger (10).  
 
Reservoir according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first part of the reservoir (I) has 

at least one inlet (30). 
Installation for storing and supplying gas at high pressure 
to at least one user station (U), characterized in that it 

comprises at least one reservoir (1) according to one of the 
preceding claims, of which the first part of the reservoir (I) 

has a second outlet (4) which can be connected to the user 
station (U) by a supply line (5) comprising a reheater (6). 
Installation according to claim 8, comprising at least one 
reservoir according to one of claims 6 and 7, characterized in 

that the section of line is connected to the first outlet (7) 
by an outer conduit (8) comprising a first pressure control 

valve (9). 
Installation according to claim 9, comprising at least one 
reservoir according to claim 7, characterized in that the 

first inlet (30) is connected to the first outlet (7) by a 
second outer conduit (11) comprising, in series, a reheater 

(12) and a second pressure control valve (13).
