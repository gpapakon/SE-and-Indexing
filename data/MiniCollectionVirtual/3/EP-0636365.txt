<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a freeze-dried 
pharmaceutical dosage form containing a porous matrix of 

a water-soluble or water-dispersible carrier material 
containing a coated pharmaceutical particle. The pharmaceutical 

granule is coated with a blend of a first polymer 
selected from the group consisting of cellulose acetate 

and cellulose acetate butyrate and a second polymer 
selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl pyrrolidone 

and hydroxypropyl cellulose.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a freeze-dried 
pharmaceutical dosage form containing coated pharmaceutical 
particles and to a process for preparing such dosage 
forms. Freeze-dried or lyophilized pharmaceutical dosage 
forms generally consist of a porous matrix of a water-soluble 
or water-dispersible carrier material which is 
impregnated with a unit dose of the pharmaceutical active. 
These dosage forms are prepared by first adding the 
pharmaceutical active to a solution comprising the carrier 
material and a suitable solvent, typically water. The 
resulting composition is then subjected to a freeze drying 
procedure whereby the solvent sublimes under a high 
vacuum. The porous matrix of the carrier material obtained 
through the freeze-drying process resembles a solid foam 
having interstices dispersed throughout. When the dosage 
form is subjected to a liquid, the liquid permeates the 
product and causes a carrier material to rapidly disintegrate 
or dissolve. This results in rapid release of the 
pharmaceutical active or other material embodied within 
the matrix. These products are considered to be fast 
dissolving dosage forms because they generally disintegrate 
in water or on the tongue within 10 seconds, and are  
 
particularly suitable for patients who have difficulty 
swallowing conventional tablets or capsules. It is generally preferred for freeze-dried dosage 
forms that the pharmaceutical be water insoluble and be 
relatively tasteless. Problems can arise for soluble 
drugs due to formation of eutectic mixtures, which lower 
the freezing point of the formulation, resulting in an 
incomplete freezing or melting during the freeze-drying 
process. The phenomenon results in product loss. Since 
the freeze-dried dosage form disintegrates rapidly in the 
mouth, rather than being swallowed as in the case of 
tablets or capsules, the pharmaceutical active should be 
substantially taste-free in order to obtain a product 
which is palatable to the consumer. Attempts have been made in freeze-dried dosage forms 
to mask the bitter or otherwise disagreeable taste of the 
pharmaceutical by shielding the pharmaceutical with a 
coating. Blank, et al., in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,760,093; 
4,760,094; and 4,767,789 suggest the use of a taste-neutral 
powder form of acetaminophen in freeze-dried 
dosage forms, which is obtained by spray-drying a suspension 
of acetaminophen in a solution of ethylcellulose or 
a copolymer based on dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and 
neutral methacrylic acid esters. In each

A freeze-dried pharmaceutical dosage form comprising 
a porous matrix of a water-soluble or water-dispersible 

carrier material containing at least one coated particle, 
said coated particle comprising at least one pharmaceutical 

coated with a blend of a first polymer which is a cellulose 
acetate or cellulose acetate butyrate and a second polymer 

which is polyvinyl pyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl cellulose, 
wherein the weight ratio of the first polymer to the second 

polymer is within the range of about 90:10 to about 50:50. 
The pharmaceutical dosage form of claim 1 wherein the 
coated particle comprises about 5 to 60 percent by weight of 

the blend of first and second polymers. 
The pharmaceutical dosage form of claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the pharmaceutical is acetaminophen, ibuprofen, 

flurbiprofen, naproxen, aspirin, pseudoephedrine, 
chlorpheniraminemaleate, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, 

famotidine, loperamide, ranitidine, cimetidine, astemizole, 
terfenadine, terfenadine carboxylate, domperidone, 

phenylpropanolamine, cetirizine, a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof or a mixture thereof and wherein 

preferably the pharmaceutical is acetaminophen, loperamide, 
famotidine or aspirin. 
The pharmaceutical dosage form of any one of claims 
1 to 3 wherein the carrier material comprises gelatin, 

pectin, mannitol or a mixture thereof, and at least one 
amino acid having from about 2 to about 12 carbon atoms. 
The pharmaceutical dosage form of claim 4 wherein said 
at least one amino acid is glycine. 
The pharmaceutical dosage form of any one of claims 
1 to 5 wherein the coated particle comprises acetaminophen 

coated with a blend of cellulose acetate and polyvinyl 
pyrrolidone, wherein the weight ratio of cellulose acetate 

to polyvinyl pyrrolidone is about 85:15. 
The pharmaceutical dosage form of claim 6 wherein the 
coated particle comprises about 20 percent by weight of said 

blend. 
The pharmaceutical dosage form of any one of claims 
1 to 7 comprising from about 10 to about 90 percent of said 

coated particle, from about 10 to about 90 percent of said 
carrier material and from about 0.05 to about 20 percent of 

a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, by weight of the 
total dosage form. 
A process for preparing a freeze-dried pharmaceutical 
dosage form, comprising the steps of: 

forming at least one coated particle by coating in a 
fluidized bed a pharmaceutical with a blend of a first 

polymer which is a cellulose acetate or cellulose acetate 
butyrate and a second polymer which is polyvinyl pyrrolidone 

or hydroxypropyl cellulose, wherein the weight ratio of the 
first polymer to the second polymer is within the range of 

about 90:10 to about 50:50; 
forming a suspension of the coated pharmaceutical particle 

in a solution comprising a water-soluble or water-dispersible 
carrier material and a solvent; and 

freeze-drying a unit volume of said suspension so as to form 
a porous matrix of the water-soluble or water-dispersible 

carrier material with said coated particle dispersed 
therethrough.
