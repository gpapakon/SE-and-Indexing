<ABSTRACT>
A radar system including a Kalman filter that processes radar return signals to produce position, velocity, acceleration, gain and residual error output signals, and a post-processor that processes these signals in accordance with a track filter bias estimation procedure. The procedure computes bias estimates and revised position, velocity and acceleration output signals that are corrected for bias error. The revised output signals are coupled to the radar system to track a target. The track filter bias estimation method computes bias estimates in accordance with relationship (I) where Res, K1/K2, R and T denote the residual, gains, range, and filter cycle time, respectively, and the tilde indicates a sample averaging. The present invention also provides for improved maneuver detection by implementing an acceleration estimation algorithm used to track a maneuvering target. The present invention is applicable in all fields and areas where estimation using Kalman filters is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TRACK FILTER BIAS ESTIMATIONBACKGROUNDThe present invention relates generally to track filtering techniques, and more particularly to a radar system employing a track filter bias estimation method that improves radar target tracking performance.In target tracking applications, optimal filtering provided by Kalman filtering techniques breaks down during a target maneuver. This is primarily due to the fact that unknown target acceleration or velocity cannot be adequately accounted for in the target model. As a result, the state estimates exhibit bias errors which cause potentially severe performance degradation, especially in angle filter estimates.Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide for an improved target tracking radar and a track filter bias estimation method that improves the filtering performance of Kalman filtering techniques employed in target tracking radars.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention comprises a radar system including a radar having an antenna that is adapted to track a moving target, and a signal processor coupled to the radar. The signal processor comprises a Kalman filter that processes radar return signals from the radar and produces position, velocity, acceleration, gain and residual error output signals, and a post-processor coupled to the Kalman filter and to the radar that processes the position, velocity, acceleration gain and residual error output signals in accordance with a predetermined track filter bias estimation procedure. The track filter bias estimation procedure computes bias estimates and computes revised position, 

velocity and acceleration output signals based on the bias estimates and that are correct¬ ed for bias error. The revised position, velocity and acceleration output signals are coupled to the radar in order to maintain target track.The present invention comprises a track filter bias estimation method that is performed in the post-processor, and the bias estimates are computed in accordance with
 / where Res, K1/K2, R and T denote the residual, gains, range, and filter cycle time, respectively, and the tilde indicates a sample averaging. The present method comprises the following steps. Radar return signals are produced by the radar system. The radar return signals are processed by a Kalman filter to produce position, velocity, acceleration, gain and residual error output signals. The gain and residual error output signals are processed in a post-processor in accor¬ dance with a predetermined track filter bias
