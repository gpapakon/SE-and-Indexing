<ABSTRACT>
Of the LED units used as picture elements 
(V50...V61,V63,V64,V65,V67,(RM,RN)) in an 

indicator device for an elevator, at 
least one is capable of emitting under 

appropriate control at least two light 
radiations of substantially different 

colours. The colour to be displayed by 
the picture element is selected or mixed 

from the colours of the LEDs in the LED 
units. In the procedure, at least one of 

the LED units is caused to emit at least 
two light radiations of different 

colours, and the LED unit is caused to 
emit at least one of the colours of the 

LED for short periods of a preset length 
at intervals of a preset length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an indicator device as 
defined in the preamble of claim 1 and to a procedure for 
controlling the display of an indicator device as defined in 
the preamble of claim 4. The indicator devices of an elevator and their operation are 
subject to various requirements. The requirements relating 
to the outward appearance of an elevator have become more 
and more significant in the elevator market. This also applies 
to the floor indicators, indicator lights and equivalent. 
The indicators must be clear and capable of imparting 
enough information, and they must fit to their environment 
and comply with the regulations of each country, both in 
respect of external design and the signs, figures and colours 
presented. To meet these requirements, several different 
parallel models of floor indicators and other devices 
are needed, and this tends to increase the unit prices of 
elevators and may involve problems e.g. with the delivery 
times of equipment. Requirements concerning variability of 
the external appearance of an elevator result in increased 
costs and may also cause problems in elevator deliveries. To provide a solution to the problems and requirements 
mentioned above, a new type of indicator device is presented 
as an invention. The indicator device of the invention is 
characterized by what is presented in the characterization 
part of claim 1, and the procedure of the invention is 
characterized by what is presented in the characterization 
part of claim 4. Other embodiments of the invention are 
characterized by the features presented in the other claims. The indicator device of the invention may be e.g. a floor 
indicator or a direction arrow indicator in an elevator car 
or at a landing, a signal light indicator placed in the car  
 
call or landing call buttons or in connection with them, or 
some other kind of indicator connected to an elevator system 
for the display of information, e.g. a display placed in an 
elevator lobby to guide arriving passengers. The advantages achieved by the present invention include the 
following: 
The various symbols can be displayed in a desired 
colour by means of a single hardware version. The colour to be displayed can be selected as one of 
the nominal colours of the light emitted by the 
display elements or as a mixture of these colours. In certain embodiments of the invention, it is 
possible to display figures in two or more colours. The brightness of the display can be adjusted to a 
suitable level with respect to the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Indicator device (1,101) having a display (5,5A,5B,105) 
with picture elements (V50...V61,V63,V64,V65,V67(RM,RN)) 

consisting of LED units, at least one of which is so 
designed that it can be caused to emit at least two light 

radiations of substantially different colours in short 
periods and in which LED unit the ratio of the durations of 

the transmission periods for different colours is set so as 
to achieve a desired colour, characterized in that the 

perceivable brightness of the LED unit is set by means of 
the ratio of the durations of the light emission periods of 

the LEDs in the LED unit to the duration of the intervals 
between the emission periods. 
Indicator device (1,101) according to claim 1, characterized 
in that each one of the LED units used as picture 

elements (V50...V61,V63, V64,V65,V67(RM,RN)) in the display 
of the indicator device can be caused to emit at least two 

light radiations of substantially different colours. 
Indicator device according any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the display (105) of the 

indicator device consists of at least one dot matrix display 
module containing several LED units as picture elements 

((RM,RN)). 
Procedure for controlling an indicator device (1,101) for 
an elevator, the picture elements (V50...V61,V63,V64,V65, 

V67) of the display of said indicator device (1,101) consisting 
of LED units as at least one of which is so designed 

that it can be caused to emit at least two light radiations 
of substantially different colours in short periods, and in 

which LED unit the ratio of the durations of the transmission 
periods for different colours is controlled so as to 

achieve a desired colour, characterized in that the brightness 
of the LED unit of the display (5,5a,5b,105) of the 

indicator device (1,101) perceivable at each instant of time 
is controlled by setting the ratio of the durations of the 

 
light emission periods of the LED unit LEDs emitting 

different colours to the duration of the intervals between 
the emission periods.
