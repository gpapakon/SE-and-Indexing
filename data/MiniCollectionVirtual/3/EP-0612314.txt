<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 2-heterocyclicethylamine derivatives, processes for their
preparation, pharmaceutical formulations comprising them, and to their use as
pharmaceuticals, in particular in the treatment of neurological disordersCompounds which possess anticonvulsant or N-methyl-(d)-aspartate (NMDA) blocking
properties are useful in the treatment and/or prevention of neurological disorders such
as stroke, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral palsy, hypoglycaemia, epilepsy, Alzheimer's
disease, Huntington's chorea, Olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy, perinatal asphyxia,
Parkinson's disease, anoxia and neuronal damage associated with substance abuse, for
example, narcotics or cocaine. Undesirable side effects are associated with some
neuroprotective agents and compounds with minimal psychotomimetic effects are
desirable.Certain 2-heteroarylethylamines and derivatives thereof have been described as
pharmaceuticals. For example, European Patent Application No. 346791 describes 1,2-diarylethylamines
in which the amine group is a cyclic amine as useful for controlling
neuropathological processes and the neurodegenerative consequences thereof in
mammals. US patent No. 4,769,466 describes N-(2-aminoacetyl)-derivatives of 1,2-diarylethylamines
in which one of the aryl groups is pyridine and the other is phenyl as
anticonvulsants. European patent application No. 356035 discloses α-phenyl-2-pyridineethanamine
as being useful for the treatment of neurological disorders.Other 2-heteroarylethylamines and derivatives thereof have been described without
mention of pharmaceutical utility. For example US patent No. 4,769,466 describes 1,2-diarylethylamines
in which one of the aryl groups is pyridine and the other is phenyl as
intermediates. German Patents Nos. 2447258 and 2415063 disclose 4-methyl, 5-ethyl
and 6-methyl-α-phenyl-2-pyridineethanamine, α-(2-furanyl)- and α-(2-thienyl)-2-pyridineethanamine
as intermediates to the corresponding amidines. Cliffe et al, 
Synthesis (12), 1138-1140(1985) describes N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-α-phenyl-2-pyridineethanamine
as an example of a highly hindered sec-alkyl-tert-alkylamine.Shuman et al, J Org Chem 27,1970-1972 (1962) describes N-[α-(2-pyridinylmethyl)benzyl]
acetamide as an intermediate.According to the invention, there is provided N-ethlyl-l-phenyl-1-2-(2-pyrazine)
ethanamine formula I,

and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I include salts
of mineral acids, for example, hydrohalic
