<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of thermal control materials
intended to be positioned between a heat source and a heat sink, and more
particularly to insulation materials for use in clothing, for example, shoe
soles/insoles.The rate of a person's thermal exchange with the environment
is dependent upon a number of factors, such as activity level, the nature and
condition of the environment, and the characteristics of the clothing having
contact with the wearer's skin. The transfer of body heat from the skin
through clothing or footwear to the environment takes place by conduction,
convection, radiation and evaporation, the physiological details and
mechanisms of which are generally well known.In footwear, conduction or convection from the foot through the shoe
to the environment is the main mode of heat loss from the foot to the outer
surface of a shoe or boot. Thermal energy is principally transferred by
conduction through the footwear, and is thereafter transferred by conduction
or convection as well as radiation from the sole to the environment.Given the propensity for the extremities and particularly the feet to easily
become cold, it is logical for efforts to have been made to improve the
insulating capacity of shoe soles and/or insoles. U.S. Patent No. 4,658,515 to
Oatman entitled "Heat Insulating Insert For Footwear" discloses a heat
retention insole for shoes comprising a laminated structure incorporating a
flexible plastic bottom sheet, a similar plastic upper sheet, and a spacer sheet
formed primarily of a foamed organic plastic material. The spacer sheet
includes large area apertures defined by bars extending transversely between
portions of a parametrial band portion. These large area apertures are loosely
filled with particles of insulating plastic materials (such as hollow polystyrene 
or polyethylene beads) which also serve to maintain the top and bottom sheets
in a spaced relationship even when subjected to foot pressure. The outer
surfaces of the insole are preferably provided with a heat reflecting coating or
film to minimize the loss of heat from the foot by radiation and reflect any such
radiated heat back in to the foot of the wearer. While somewhat effective, this
insole relies on trapped air within cellular spaces to retard the flow of heat.
Compression of the insulating material reduces the volume of the trapped air
space which, in turn, increases thermal conductivity and increases the rate of
heat loss through the footwear.Another example of an insulating insole is
