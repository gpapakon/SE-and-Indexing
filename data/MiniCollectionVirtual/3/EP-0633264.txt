<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to soluble aluminoxane derivatives and
more particularly to tertiary amino-aluminoxane halide derivatives, obtained by the
reaction of aluminoxanes with less than stoichiometric amounts of tertiary amine
hydrohalides, which in the presence of metallocenes form catalytically active
compositions for olefin polymerization.Pasynkiewicz (Polyhedron (1990), 9, 429-453) describes the synthesis
and characterization of aluminoxane complexes with electron donor reagents. These
reactions generally result in complex equilibrium products. Isolation of
characterizable products from these reactions is often very difficult. Thus, a
crystalline complex of tetramethylaluminoxane and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine
(TMEDA) was obtained in 5-10% yield, by partial hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum
(TMA) in TMEDA. Amines and ether complexes of aluminoxanes have
been described, but they are usually unstable and decompose into the corresponding
trialkylaluminum adduct, for example Et3Al路THF and Me3Al路PhOMe. In almost all
of the aluminoxane complexes, only the tetraalkylaluminoxane adducts, having one or
two Al-O-Al bonds are formed. These materials are usually inactive or have inferior
activity, compared to the regular oligomeric aluminoxanes, in olefin oligomerization
or polymerization.A British patent 1,319,746 describes the hydrolysis of R3Al (C2 to C4) in
tertiary amine solvent whereby the resulting aluminoxane contained no amine (or N
atoms) after removal of the amine by distillation.Pasynkiewicz et. al. (Journal of Organometallic Chemistry (1980), 186,
185-191) also reported the preparation of complexes of tetraalkylaluminoxanes with
benzylamine and methylamine. Although, these compounds are inactive in olefin
polymerization,the authors showed by spectroscopic methods that the reaction
products consisted of mixtures of different isomeric trimers. Laubengayer et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1961), 83 542-546) have
described the reactions of amines and amine hydrohalides with alkylaluminum
compounds. Amines react with thalkylaluminum compounds to give different
products. Thus, the reactions with tertiary, secondary and primary amines resulted in
R3N-AlR3 adducts, [R2N-AlR2]2 dimers and [RN-AlR]n oligomers respectively.
Similarly, amine hydrohalides react with alkylaluminum compounds to give different
products. The reactions of R3N路HX with R3Al and also that of R3N with R2AlX
resulted in the same adduct product R3N-AlR2X. Secondary amines, R2NH, react with
R2AlX just as R2NH路HX reacts with
