<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a system for utilizing a printable, yet unobtrusive glyph or 
similar two-dimensionally encoded mark to identify copyrighted documents. Upon 

attempting to reproduce such a document, the glyph is detected by a detector (30), decoded 
by a decoder (34) and used to accurately collect and/or record a copyright royalty for the 

reproduction of the document, or to prevent such reproduction. Furthermore, the glyph may 

also include additional information so as to enable an electronic copyright royalty accounting 
system, capable of interpreting the encoded information, to track and/or account for copyright 

royalties which accrue during reproduction of all or portions of the original document.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for detecting the 
copying of a document protected by a copyright on a reprographic device, and more 
particularly to the automatic collection and/or recording of copyright royalty fee information 
based upon encoded copyright information recorded on the copyrighted document. Reprographic devices (by which is meant devices intended for the convenient 
reproduction in hardcopy form of documents, whether said documents are in paper, other 
hardcopy, or electronic form prior to said reproduction, including photocopiers, electronic 
printers, digital copiers, telecopiers, spirit duplicators, and the like) are used to reproduce all 
types of documents, including documents that should not be reproduced, or whose 
reproduction should be limited, tracked or controlled. One common example of a potential 
abuse of reprographic devices is the copying or reprinting of materials subject to copyright. 
Recently, many governments have updated copyright laws, and worldwide efforts have been 
underway to develop a means by which authors and publishers can be fairly recompensed for 
such copying. Non-profit national collectives, for example the Copyright Clearance Center in 
the United States, usually referred to as Reproduction Rights Organizations (RRO's), implement 
copyright licensing systems and convey royalties to the authors and publishers. The RRO's 
derive their authority from national legislation, contracts with the authors and publishers, and 
bilateral agreements with other RRO's. Generally, an RRO pursues the licensing of specific organizations, for example, 
schools, governments, and private enterprise. In some cases the RRO may grant permission, on 
a case-by-case basis, for copying particular jobs in return for a specific fee. As an alternative to 
this transaction-based system, the RRO may grant a blanket license. In a typical blanket license, 
an organization agrees to pay royalties to the RRO for the reproduction of copyrighted 
materials over a specified number of years, where the royalty is based upon a sampled survey of 
the licensee's copier usage. The licensee pays the RRO a fixed per copy fee for estimated copyright copies for the 
duration of the license. Paying such fees is often preferable to the licensee than buying the 
publications or continuing to make illegal copies. Of course, while such schemes are commonly 
applied to photocopying, they could apply to materials reproduced by other reprographic 
means, such as electronic

<CLAIMS>
A system to measure and accrue for copyright royalties accrued as a result of printing 
a copyrighted document on a document printer, including: 

   a digitized representation of the copyrighted document having a printable code on 
each page thereof, said representation being provided for reproduction by the document 

printer; 
   an image processing device for detecting the presence of the printable code in said 

digitized representation of the copyrighted document; 
   a decoder for transforming the printable code into a digital representation of 

alphanumeric characters; 
   a parser, responsive to said decoder, for determining whether the alphanumeric 

characters indicate that a copyright royalty is required for reproduction of the copyrighted 
document; and 

   accounting means for recording the copyright royalty due. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, further including means for collecting the copyright 
royalty before printing the copyrighted document. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, further including: 
   means for electronically recording, along with the copyright royalty due, an account 

identifier to which said copyright royalty is to be charged; and 
   means for effecting a transaction with the identified account so as to transfer funds 

at least equal to the copyright royalty due. 
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, further including means for 
reproducing the printable code on each reproduction of the original document, wherein the 

printable code on the reproduced document is detectable by the apparatus during a 
subsequent reproduction operation. 
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, further including marking means for 
automatically placing indicia on each reproduction of the copyrighted document to indicate 

that the copyright royalty has been accrued for the reproduced document, thereby 
designating the reproduction as an authorized reproduction of the copyrighted document. 
A system as claimed in claim 5, wherein said marking means automatically places 
encoded indicia on each reproduction of the copyrighted document representing additional 

information from one or more items of the group consisting of: 
   a time that the reproduction was made; 

   a location where the reproduction was made; 
   an individual who made the reproduction; and 

   a machine identifier indicating the document printer on which the reproduction was 
made. 
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein said decoder comprises: 
   first parsing means for parsing the decoded data to determine the copyright royalty; 

and 
   second parsing means for parsing the decoded data to determine additional 

information from one or more items of the group consisting of: 
   author, 

   publisher, 
   ISBN number, 

   ISSN number, and 
   electronic address of a copyright holder, and optionally said first parsing means is 

capable of determining which pages, lines, photographs and illustrations are being copied 
from said copyrighted document so as to determine the copyright royalty as a function 

thereof. 
An apparatus, associated with a reprographic device, for tracking the reproduction 
of at least a portion of a copyrighted document having a visible self-clocking glyph code on 

each page thereof, said apparatus comprising: 
   a scanning mech
anism for scanning the visible self-clocking glyph code contained on 
at least a portion of a document page being reproduced by said reprographic device and 

generating a plurality of digital signals representative thereof; 
   memory for storing the digital signals generated by said digital scanning means; and 

   a decoder for decoding digital signals representative of the visible self-clocking 
glyph code within the stored digital signals to determine if a copyright royalty is associated 

with the reproduced page. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 8, wherein the visible glyph code further delimits a 
portion of the copyrighted document and/or wherein the visible glyph code delimiting the 

portion of the copyrighted document further identifies a holder of the copyright for the 
delimited portion thereof and/or wherein the visible glyph code delimiting the portion of the 

copyrighted document further identifies that portion of the document as one which is to be 
cropped during reproduction by the reprographic device. 
An apparatus to prevent the unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted materials on 
a document printer, including: 

   means for sensing the presence of a printable self-clocking glyph code on at least 
one page of an original document; 

   means for decoding the printable code; 
   means, responsive to said decoding means, for determining that the document is 

copyrighted; and 
   means for disabling the reproduction of the document upon a determination that 

the document is copyrighted. 
A method of detecting a requirement for payment of copyright royalties accrued as 
a result of printing a copyrighted document on a document printer, including: 

   scanning at least a portion of the copyrighted document to produce a digitized 
representation thereof, said copyrighted document having a printable self-clocking glyph code 

on each page thereof; 
   detecting the presence of the printable self-clocking glyph code in the digitized 

representation of the scanned portion of the copyrighted document; 
   decoding the printable self-clocking glyph code; and 

   determining, from said decoding step, if a copyright royalty is required for 
reproduction of the copyrighted document.
