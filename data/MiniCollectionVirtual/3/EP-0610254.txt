<ABSTRACT>
A novel neurotrophic factor referred to as glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified and isolated from serum free growth conditioned medium of B49 glioblastoma cells. Rat and human genes encoding GDNF have been cloned and sequenced. A gene encoding GDNF has been subcloned into a vector, and the vector has been used to transform a host cell in order to produce biologically active GDNF in a recombinant DNA process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to neurotrophic
factors and glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in
particular. Also included within this invention are
processes for purification of GDNF from natural sources
and processes for cloning rat and human genes encoding
GDNF, as well as the nucleic acid sequence of the rat
and human genes that encode GDNF. The GDNF gene has
been subcloned into an expression vector, and the
vector used to express biologically active GDNF. In
addition, this invention includes the use of GDNF for
preventing and treating nerve damage and nerve related
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.Antibodies to GDNF are disclosed, as well as
methods for identifying members of the GDNF family of
neurotrophic factors. And finally, methods are
described for preventing or treating nerve damage by
implanting into patients cells that secrete GDNF.Neurotrophic factors are natural proteins,
found in the nervous system or in non-nerve tissues
innervated by the nervous system, whose function is to
promote the survival and maintain the phenotypic
differentiation of nerve and/or glial cells (Varon and
Bunge 1979 Ann. Rev. Neuroscience 1:327; Thoenen and
Edgar 1985 Science 229:238). Because of this
physiological role, neurotrophic factors may be useful
in treating the degeneration of nerve cells and loss of
differentiated function that occurs in a variety of
neurodegenerative diseases.In order for a particular neurotrophic factor
to be potentially useful in treating nerve damage, the
class or classes of damaged nerve cells must be
responsive to the factor. Different neurotrophic
factors typically affect distinctly different classes
of nerve cells. Therefore, it is advisable to have on 
hand a variety of different neurotrophic factors to
treat each of the classes of damaged neurons that may
occur with different forms of disease or injury.Neurotrophic factors can protect responsive
neurons against a variety of unrelated insults. For
example, the neurotrophic factor nerve growth factor
(NGF) will rescue a significant portion of sensory
neurons from death caused by cutting their axonal
processes (Rich et al. 1987 J. Neurocytol 16:261; Otto
et al. 1987 J. Neurosci 83:156), from ontogenetic death
during embryonic development (Hamburger et al. 1984 J.
Neurosci 4:767), and from damage caused by
administration of taxol or cisplatin (Apfel et al. 1991
Ann Neurol. 29: 87). This apparent generality of
protection has lead to the concept that if a
neurotrophic factor protects responsive neurons against
experimental
