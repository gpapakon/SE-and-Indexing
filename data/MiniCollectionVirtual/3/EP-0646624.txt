<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to propylene polymer
compositions comprising two kinds of propylene
polymers and to injection molded articles formed from propylene polymer compositions
comprising two kinds of propylene polymers.Propylene polymers have been conventionally molded by
various molding methods and the molded articles have
extensive uses.The propylene polymers are generally prepared using a
catalyst comprising a transition metal compound and an
organoaluminum compound, i.e. a so-called Ziegler catalyst.Propylene polymers prepared by the use of a titanium Ziegler
catalyst containing a halogen-containing titanium catalyst
component have excellent
moldability and rigidity, but
poor tensile elongation at break. Moreover,
the titanium catalyst causes a large amount of catalyst
residue in the resulting polymer because of its low
polymerization activity, and hence the molded article is
sometimes colored or has reduced sanitariness. On the other hand, propylene polymers prepared by the
use of a metallocene catalyst containing a transition metal
compound catalyst component such as zirconocene have
excellent tensile elongation at break, but
poor moldability and
rigidity (flexural modulus). However,
the amount of the metallocene catalyst residue is
small because of its high polymerization activity, and the
molded article is never colored and has good
sanitariness.Though the characteristics required for the propylene
polymers vary depending on the molding methods or uses,
generally required are, for example, moldability, heat resistance,
mechanical strength, high tensile elongation at break and
impact resistance. For satisfying these requirements,
research on various compositions such as a composition
obtained by blending two or more kinds of propylene
polymers and a composition obtained by blending a propylene
polymer and other synthetic resin has been carried out.For example, blending two propylene
polymers which have different molecular weights has
been carried out to improve the physical properties of
the propylene polymers prepared by the use of a titanium
catalyst. However, when two such propylene polymers
are blended to
prepare a propylene polymer composition, the tensile
elongation at break of the resulting composition is 
markedly lowered, though the moldability is
improved.Further, adding a soft polymer to a propylene
polymer which has been prepared by the use of a titanium catalyst
has been carried out to improve the tensile
elongation at break and the impact resistance of the
propylene polymer.
