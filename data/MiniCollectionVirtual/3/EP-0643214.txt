<ABSTRACT>
The fixed injection periods for the starting phase of an internal combustion engine, calculated for normal pressure of the outside air, are adjusted to the currently prevailing outside air pressure by an amount representing the outside air pressure which was determined whilst the engine was last running.

Method for adapting the starting injection period 
(KTI) for an internal combustion engine to the pressure 

of the external air, 

in which the injection period is determined at least 
temporarily on the basis of air values (LW) measured by 

means of an air mass meter and on the basis of at least 
one further operating parameter of the internal combustion 

engine, 
substitute air (EW) are used for the values air 
instead of the air values (LW) supplied by the air mass 

meter in the event of pulsations of the intake air of the 
internal combustion engine, 
the substitute air values (EW) are adapted to the 
external air pressure by means of an adaptation factor, 
a correction factor (KF) which represents the 
external air pressure is stored when the internal combustion 

engine is switched off, 
when the internal combustion engine is restarted, 
the value of the starting injection period (KTI) is 

modified by means of this correction factor (KF), this 
starting injection period being defined irrespective of 

air-quantity or air-mass values measured upon starting, 
and 
the adaptation factor is used as the correction 
factor (KF). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the correction factor (KF) is calculated in accordance 

with the following formula: 

KF = LW / LE * TF, 
 
LW denoting the air value measured by the air mass meter  

 
in the intake duct of the internal combustion engine, LE 

denoting the substitute air value stored in a performance 
graph, and TF denoting a temperature factor which is 

calculated in accordance with the following formula: 

TF
 = 
293
K
t
+273
K
. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the correction factor (KF) is subjected to a 

process of sliding averaging. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that when the internal combustion engine is first started 

the correction factor (KF) is set to one.
