<ABSTRACT>
A combined manufacturing-filter assembly unit (1) 
for producing filter-tipped cigarettes, wherein one 

frame (2) supports a U-shaped manufacturing line (3) 
presenting a first and second branch (4, 5) arranged 

substantially side by side and parallel to each other, 
and an intermediate transverse branch (6) connecting the 

output of the first branch (4) to the input of the 
second branch (5); the first branch (4) being defined by 

a line (7) for producing cigarette portions (8); the 
second branch (5) being defined by a line (9) for 

connecting the cigarette portions (8) to respective 
filters and so producing filter-tipped cigarettes; and 

the intermediate branch (6) being defined by a transfer 
unit (10), the output of which is defined by a device 

(37) for rotating the cigarette portions (8) 
substantially 90° about an axis perpendicular to their 

own axis prior to feeding them to the second branch (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combined
manufacturing-filter assembly unit for producing
filter-tipped cigarettes.Filter-tipped cigarette manufacturing lines are
known to feature a cigarette manufacturing machine
connected in series with at least one filter assembly
machine via a transfer device; which lines, by
comprising two or more in-line machines, are invariably
cumbersome and require at least one operator for each
machine.The above applies to known combined
manufacturing-filter assembly units for producing
filter-tipped cigarettes and of the type disclosed, for
example, in the preamble of US-A-4807738, that is of the
type comprising a frame; and a manufacturing line
supported on the frame and in turn comprising a first
and second branch, and an intermediate branch connecting
an output of the first branch to an input of the second
branch; the first branch being defined by a line for 
producing cigarette portions; and the second branch
being defined by a filter assembly line for connecting
the cigarette portions to respective filters and so
forming filter-tipped cigarettes.In practice, the above known combined
manufacturing-filter assembly units consist of a
cigarette manufacturing machine aligned with one filter
assembly machine and connected thereto via an
intermediate branch, which is supported, together with
the above two machines, on a single elongated frame
involving the use, owing to its length, of at least two
operators.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a compact filter-tipped cigarette manufacturing
line which may be controlled by one operator.According to the present invention, there is
provided a combined manufacturing-filter assembly unit
for producing filter-tipped cigarettes, the unit
comprising a frame; and a manufacturing line supported
on the frame and in turn comprising a first and second
branch, and an intermediate branch connecting an output
of the first branch to an input of the second branch;
the first branch being defined by a line for producing
cigarette portions; the second branch being defined by a
filter assembly line for connecting the cigarette
portions to respective filters and so forming
filter-tipped cigarettes; and the unit being
characterized in that said manufacturing line is 
U-shaped; said first and second branch being arranged
substantially side by side and parallel to each other;
and said intermediate branch being a transverse branch
defined by a transfer unit comprising a position change
device for rotating the cigarette portions

<CLAIMS>
A combined manufacturing-filter assembly unit
for producing filter-tipped cigarettes, the unit (1)

comprising a frame (2); and a manufacturing line (3)
supported on the frame (2) and in turn comprising a

first and second branch (4, 5), and an intermediate
branch (6) connecting an output of the first branch (4)

to an input of the second branch (5); the first branch
(4) being defined by a line (7) for producing cigarette

portions (8); the second branch (5) being defined by a
filter assembly line (9) for connecting the cigarette

portions (8) to respective filters and so forming
filter-tipped cigarettes; and the unit (1) being

characterized in that said manufacturing line (3) is
U-shaped; said first and second branch (4, 5) being

arranged substantially side by side and parallel to each
other; and said intermediate branch (6) being a

transverse branch defined by a transfer unit (10)
comprising a position change device (37) for rotating

the cigarette portions (8) substantially 90° about an
axis perpendicular to their own axis.
A unit as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that said transfer unit (10) comprises an intermediate

transfer member (28) for feeding the cigarette portions
(8) transversely along the intermediate branch (6), the

intermediate transfer member (28) having seats (30)
parallel to the first branch (4) and for receiving 

respective cigarette portions (8); an input transfer
member (31) located along the output end (19) of the

first branch (4), for successively removing the
cigarette portions (8) from the first branch (4) and

feeding said cigarette portions (8) longitudinally, and
parallel to themselves, into respective seats (30) on

the intermediate transfer member (28); and an output
transfer member (37) connected to the intermediate

transfer member (28) and comprising said position change
device (37).
A unit as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in
that the intermediate transfer member (28) comprises an

intermediate transfer roller (28) mounted for rotation
about an axis (29), which is parallel to the first

branch (4) and is arranged at a higher level than said
output end (19) of the first branch (4).
A unit as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in
that the input transfer member (31) is mounted for

rotation about an axis (32) perpendicular to the first
branch (4).
A unit as claimed in Claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that the filter assembly line (9)

comprises an input roller (23) mounted for rotation
about an axis (24) perpendicular to the second branch

(5); the output transfer member (37) comprising a
truncated-cone-shaped roller (37) having an angle of

substantially 90° and tangent to both the intermediate
transfer roller (28) and the input roller (23) of the 

filter assembly line (9).
A unit as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in
that the rotation axes (38, 29, 24) of the

truncated-cone-shaped roller (37), the intermediate
transfer roller (28) and the input roller (23) of the

filter assembly line (9) are substantially coplanar.
