<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic material, and more particularly to a silver 
halide photographic material improved in fluctuations of 
photographic sensitivity with printing temperature and 
photographic sensitivity during storage. Silver halide photographic materials indicate 
variations in photographic sensitivity with changes in 
temperature on exposure, or printing temperature dependency, 
which is one problem in using. An improvement in 
fluctuations of photographic sensitivity during storage 
has also hitherto been desired. Previously, as to compounds similar to those 
represented by formula (I) of the present invention 
described hereinafter, the use thereof as precursors has 
been disclosed in JP-A-61-196240 (the term "JP-A" as 
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese 
patent application"), the use thereof as ultraviolet 
absorbers in European Patent 40,583, the use thereof as 
color sensitizers in U.S. Patent 3,615,533, the use 
thereof as stabilizers in U.S. Patent 3,549,371, and the 
use thereof as supersensitizers for 2'-cyanine and  
 
oxacarbocyanine in U.S. Patent 2,423,710. It has not 
been known at all, however, that hydrazones having the 
specified structure used in the present invention 
improve exposure temperature dependency of silver halide 
photographic materials spectrally sensitized with 
spectrally sensitizing dyes having the specified structure 
in the present invention, and that they improve 
storage stability. An object of the present invention is to improve 
fluctuations of photographic sensitivity with printing 
temperature of a silver halide photographic material 
spectrally sensitized with a specified color sensitizing 
dye, and further to improve the deviations of photographic 
sensitivity thereof during storage. This and other objects of the present invention 
can be achieved by a silver halide photographic material 
comprising a support having thereon at least one silver 
halide emulsion layer, wherein the layer contains at 
least one compound represented by the following formula 
(I) and at least one compound represented by the 
following formula (X). Preferably, the above-described 
silver halide photographic material is spectrally 
sensitized with the compound represented by formula (X).  Formulae (I) and (X) are as follows: 
wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are the same or different and each 
represents a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic 
group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group or a 
substituted or unsubstituted
