<ABSTRACT>
In such a spray booth, workpieces are sprayed by means of a spray device (3) with a liquid, water-soluble coating substance on a work location (2), and the excess spraying medium is allowed to settle on at least one draining surface (4, 5) behind the work location (2) in the spraying direction, the draining surface (4, 5) being flooded with water-soluble coating substance as the spraying medium. The draining surface and the associated feeding and returning devices (7-11) for the spraying medium are rinsed at periodic time intervals by means of rinsing water from a rinsing water supply. A proportion of the rinsing water corresponding to the evaporation loss of the spraying medium is taken from the supply tank (12) and fed to the spraying medium. The rinsing water supply is topped up by a corresponding proportion of fresh water, for which purpose the supply tank is equipped with a fresh-water connection (16).
