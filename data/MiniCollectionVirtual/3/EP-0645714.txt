<ABSTRACT>
In order to effect a repair, as and when defective cells appear in an integrated circuit memory, an auxiliary memory is provided in conjunction with a programmable comparator. Whenever it is desired to read the cells of the memory, the auxiliary memory is read and its contents are compared with the address selected from the memory plane. The result of this comparison produces, in real time, the signals for addressing a redundant cell and signals for killing the cell initially encountered. This system is more especially usable in the field of EEPROM memories.
