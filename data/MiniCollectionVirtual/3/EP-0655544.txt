<ABSTRACT>
The cross-bars (12, 13) are fastened via the connecting piece (14) on the continuous through-bar (11) in such a manner that the connecting piece (14) passes through the continuous through-bar (11), projects out of it on both sides and can be plugged into the two cross-bars (12, 13) by means of the projecting ends (15, 16). The continuous through-bar (11) is of an essentially rectangular design in cross-section, two mutually opposite side (17, 18) projecting beyond the webs (19, 20), which connect said sides, with extensions (21, 22). In the region of said webs (21, 22), the continuous through-bar (11) exhibits a through-passage opening (23) for the connecting piece (14). The cross-bars (12, 13) are of an essentially rectangular design in cross-section, the spacing between two opposite sides corresponding approximately to the dimension between the two extensions (21, 22) of the continuous through-bar (11). Clamping ribs for the connecting piece (14) are arranged in the cavity of the bars (11, 12, 13).
