<ABSTRACT>
A method for operating an electrophotographic proofing system for generating color proofs from image information during multiple imaging cycle proofing runs. Charge model information, development model information and toner replenishment model information are stored for each component color. Actual photoconductor charge characteristics are measured during the imaging cycles of the proofing runs. Actual toner characteristics from component color test patches developed during the imaging cycles are also measured. The photoconductor is charged during the imaging cycles as a function of the charge characteristics measured during a preceding imaging cycle for the same component color, and as a function of the charge model information for the color. The photoconductor is toned during imaging cycles as a function of toner characteristics measured from test patches during a preceding imaging cycle for the same component color and as a function of the development model information for the color. Working toner is replenished after the imaging cycles as a function of the development parameters used to tone the photoconductor during the imaging cycles for the same component color and as a function of the replenishment model information for the color. Charge model information and the development model information for each component color are updated as a function of measured values after the imaging cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
electrophotographic printing systems. In particular,
the invention is an image density process control
system for a full color electrophotographic proofing
system.Electrophotographic proofing systems are
generally known and described, for example, in the
U.S.-A- 4,728,983, U.S.-A-
4,708,459 and U.S.-A-
4,780,744. Systems of these types include a computer-based
control system, and an organic photoconductor
(OPC) which is sequentially driven past charging,
exposing (imaging), developing and transfer stations
during multiple imaging cycle (toning pass) proofing
runs. A separate imaging cycle is performed for each
component color used to create the image.During each imaging cycle the OPC is first
charged to an initial voltage by a charging device such
as a scorotron at the charge station. The charged OPC
is then exposed or imaged to produce a charge pattern
representative of the image to be printed. Exposed
portions of the OPC are thereby discharged to a final
voltage. A bias voltage is applied to the development
station to create a development voltage differential
between the toning station and OPC. Charged toner is
drawn to the imaged OPC as a function of the
development voltage and OPC charge profile to develop
or tone the imaged OPC as it passes the development
station. This imaging cycle procedure is repeated for
each component color to produce a composite image
assembly in registration on the OPC. The proofing run 
is completed when the composite image assembly is
transferred to a backing by the transfer station.The amount, and therefore density, of toner
applied to the OPC at the developing station is
controlled to impart desired color characteristics to
the proof. Unfortunately, elements of the
electrophotographic process described above have
characteristics which change over time and produce
unpredictable variations in system dynamics. Two of
the most serious process variables are changing charge
characteristics of the OPC and changes in the dynamics
of the developing system (both toner and mechanism).Both US-A-4,708,459 and US-A-4,780,744
describe a half-tone separation
proofing system which includes compensation techniques
for reducing toner density dependance on
process variables. This compensation technique
includes the use of four empirically derived
mathematical models: a charger model, an exposure
model, a decay model and a developer (toning) model.
The charger model mathematically predicts the initial
or unexposed voltage placed onto the OPC by
