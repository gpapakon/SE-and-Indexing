<ABSTRACT>
A method for the production of alkyl glycosides by continuous reaction of monosaccharides with fatty alcohols in the presence of an acid catalyst is characterised in that monosaccharide, fatty alcohol and catalyst are continuously metered into a stirred vessel, the reaction is carried out under stationary conditions with a conversion of 97 % +/- 2.5 % based on monosaccharide used, water is continuously removed from the stirred vessel, and the reaction mixture is discharged from the stirred vessel in an amount which essentially corresponds to the amount of reactants and catalysts metered in.
