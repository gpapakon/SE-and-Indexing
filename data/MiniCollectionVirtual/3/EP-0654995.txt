<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of 4-oxa-1-azabicyclo 
[3,2,0] heptan-7-one derivatives for the 
preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the 
treatment of tumors. Since the isolation and structure elucidation of natural 
β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, [Antimicrobial Agents 
and Chemotherapy, 11, 852 (1977)], as metabolized product of 
streptomyces clavuligerus , a number of exploratory efforts 
have been made to isolate another antibiotics. On the other 
hands, several synthetic studies also have been done for the 
β-lactam compounds which have 4-oxa-1-azabicyclo[3,2,0] 
heptan-7-one (oxapenam) skeletons [DT2702091 A1, EP 0057664 
A2, DT 2725690 A1, British Patent 1585661, J. Chem. Soc. 
Perkin Trans I, 2222 (1980), J. Antibiotics,26, 217 (1983), 
J. Org. Chem., 50, 3457-3462 (1985), J. Antibiotics, 29, 510 
(1986),ibid, 29, 516 (1987), Tetrahedron, 2467 (1987), Chem. 
Pharm. Bull., 39, 2813-2818 (1991)]. However, in most case, attention were paid to their strong 
antibacterial, antifungal and β-lactamase inhibitory 
activities. We paid attention to the cytotoxic activities of G0069A (JP 
61-212587) and Tü1718 (DE 3727651 A1), produced by genus 
Streptomyces and have been trying to develop them as 
antitumor agents. However, there were lots of difficulties 
to obtain these compounds in large scale. For example, only 
20mg of G0069A was isolated from 10L of fermentation broth 
even after under well controlled fermentation technique and 
suitable experimental conditions. G0069A is chemically very unstable. Isolation process 
required very complex and special technique and should be 
done in dark at low temperature. In addition to the 
complexity in isolation of G0069A from fermentation broth, 
the synthetic approach is also seemed to be extremely 
difficult multistep process because they have 5 asymmetric 
centers and dipeptide side chain. Therefore, it is necessary 
to get compounds which are relatively easy to synthesis, 
have shorter chain than G0069A, chemically stable and have 
strong antitumor activity.  
 
The present invention relates to the use, for the 
preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the 
treatment of tumors, of a 4-oxa-1-azabicyclo [3,2,0] 
heptan-7-one derivative represented by the formula I or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof 
Wherein R is
