<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pyrotechnic head of the type comprising an elongate casing (100), a pyrotechnic composition (200, 210, 220) contained in the casing, and dispersion means for dispersing the said pyrotechnic composition. The dispersion means include longitudinal detonating cutting cords (10), able to cut the casing longitudinally, and a transverse detonating cutting cord (20) able to cut the casing transversely.

A pyrotechnical head of the type comprising an elongate envelope 
(100) including a cylindrical body (110) that is circularly 

symmetrical about an axis of symmetry, that is closed at its rear end 
by an end wall (120), a pyrotechnical composition (200, 210, 220) 

contained in the envelope, and dispersal means for dispersing said 
pyrotechnical composition and comprising longitudinal fuses (10) for 

splitting purposes adapted to split the envelope longitudinally, the 
head being characterized in that the longitudinal fuses are 

detonating fuses, the pyrotechnical head further includes a 
transverse detonating fuse (20) for splitting purposes adapted to 

split the envelope transversely, said transverse detonating fuse for 
splitting purposes being placed at the periphery of the inside 

surface of the envelope in front of its end wall, an explosive slug 
(150) is placed at the front end of the envelope, and pyrotechnical 

initiation means (160) extend forwards from the rear of the envelope 
up to the explosive slug, the transverse detonating fuse (20) being 

adapted to cut off the rear end of the envelope (100) transversely 
before the longitudinal detonating fuses (10) have completely split 

the envelope in the longitudinal direction, such that under the 
effect of the longitudinal detonating fuses the envelope is split and 

opened in the form of segments that are hinged at the front. 
A pyrotechnical head according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the end wall (120) has a shape that is generally convex towards the 

outside. 
A pyrotechnical head according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said transverse detonating fuse is situated substantially at the 

junction between said cylindrical body and the end wall. 
A pyrotechnical head according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that said pyrotechnical composition comprises an 

incendiary substance (200) and a pyrogenic substance (210) adapted to 
ignite the incendiary substance, the two substances being placed in 

separate compartments (130, 140) inside the envelope.  
 
A pyrotechnical head according to claim 4, the envelope being 
closed at its front end by a nose (125) of a shape that is generally 

convex towards the outside, the head being characterized in that said 
pyrogenic substance (210) is placed in the nose of the envelope, and 

said incendiary substance (200) is placed in the cylindrical body of 
the envelope. 
A pyrotechnical head according to claim 5, characterized in that 
said pyrotechnical composition further comprises a lacrimatory 

substance (220) placed in a compartment (161) situated in the nose of 
the envelope, opposite to the compartment containing the incendiary 

substance. 
A pyrotechnical head according to any one of claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that explosive slug (150) is placed in front of the 

compartment containing said pyrogenic substance (210). 
A pyrotechnical head according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the explosive slug is placed between the compartment (161) 

containing the lacrimatory substance and the compartment (130) 
containing the pyrogenic substance. 
A pyrotechnical head according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that said pyrotechnical initiation means are placed 

in the center of the envelope and extend along said axis of symmetry 
of the envelope. 
A pyrotechnical head according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the transverse detonating fuse (20) is placed 

in the proximity of at least one longitudinal detonating fuse in such 
a manner that the transverse detonating fuse is initiated by the 

longitudinal detonating fuses. 
A pyrotechnical head according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the transverse detonating fuse is placed at a distance from the rear 

axial ends (141) of the longitudinal detonating fuses.  
 
A pyrotechnical head according to claim 11, characterized in that 
the transversal detonating fuse is placed at a distance from the rear 

axial ends of the longitudinal detonating fuses lying in the range 
one-fourth to one-eight of the length thereof. 
A pyrotechnical head according to any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that said pyrotechnical initiation means (160) are 

placed in the proximity of the longitudinal detonating fuses (10) in 
such a manner that said pyrotechnical initiation means (160) initiate 

the longitudinal detonating fuses (10) which in turn initiate the 
transverse detonating fuse (20). 
A pyrotechnical head according to any one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the longitudinal detonating fuses are placed on 

the inside surface of the envelope. 
A pyrotechnical head according to claim 14, characterized in that 
each of the longitudinal detonating fuses extends in a plane that 

contains the axis of symmetry of the envelope.
