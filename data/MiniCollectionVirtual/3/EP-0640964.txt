<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a target
material for magneto-optical recording medium having a
low magnetic permeability which is suitable particularly
for magnetron sputtering, and a process for
producing the target material.Magneto-optical recording media have come to
be used as rewritable recording media with a large
capacity in storage devices of computers or for filing
of imagerial informations. They have come to be used
also as small-sized recording media called "minidisc"
for music or data recording.In these magneto-optical recording media, the
magneto-optical characteristics of an amorphous thin
film composed mainly of a rare earth element and an
element of the iron group are usually utilized.The thin film used for magneto-optical
recording media is usually prepared by sputtering
deposition.There are various methods for the sputtering,
for example, a method of sputtering simple substances
of a rare earth element and an element of the iron
group, respectively, at the same time as separate
targets (co-sputtering method); and a method of sputtering
a target previously obtained by alloying or 
compositing an element which is desired to be formed
into a thin film.Of such targets, the composite type targets
for magneto-optical recording medium disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 62-70550 (JP-A-62 070550) and 1-25977,
i.e., the targets comprising a rare-earth element
containing phase composed mainly of a rare earth
element and/or an intermetallic compound or alloy of a
are earth element and an element of the iron group, and
a metallic phase composed mainly of an element of the
iron group, have come to be widely used because they
are advantageous in that the component distribution in
a film can be made uniform by microstructure control of
the target, as compared with the compound type target
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1-149959.Since a rare earth element contained in a
target is very active, one or more additive elements
are often added for improving the corrosion resistance
of a thin film. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 1-247571 reports a method for improving the corrosion
resistance of a thin film by using a target
material containing 15% by atom or less of at least one
additive element selected from the group consisting of
Ti, Al, Cu, Cr, Nb, Ta, Pd and Pt.Of the above-mentioned sputtering methods,
magnetron sputtering suitable for increasing deposition
rate has recently become a leading method. This
magnetron sputtering comprises generating a leakage 
magnetic
