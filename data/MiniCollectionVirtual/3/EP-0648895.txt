<ABSTRACT>
A rail grinding machine (1) for grinding off irregularities on a rail-head surface (9) of a track comprises a machine frame (2), which is supported on rail running gear, and a guide frame (14) which is connected thereto via height-adjusting drives (17), is able to roll on the rail (10) via flanged rollers (15) and bears a grinding unit (18). The grinding unit (18) is equipped with a grinding belt (25) which can be pressed onto the rail-head surface (9) by a press-on member (28) and can be wound up by its ends on a supply reel and a collecting reel (26,27), respectively. The grinding unit (18) is mounted so as to be adjustable, together with the supply reel and the collecting reel (26,27), relative to the guide frame (14) horizontally and in the longitudinal direction of the machine and is connected to the guide frame (14) via a drive device (21) for an oscillating working movement which is superimposed on the advance of the machine (1).

A rail grinding machine (1) for grinding irregularities on a rail head
surface (9) of a track, comprising a machine frame (2) supported on on-track

undercarriages (3) and a guide frame (14) which is connected to the said
machine frame by way of vertical adjustment drives (17), is designed for

riding on the rail (10) by means of flanged rollers (15) and supports at least
one grinding unit (18), the grinding unit having a grinding band (25) which

may be pressed onto the rail head surface (9) by means of a pressing
member (28) and the ends of which may be wound on a supply- and a

collecting reel (26,27) respectively, 
characterized in
 that the grinding unit
(18), together with the supply- and collecting reels (26,27) and the pressing

member (28), is arranged on a tool frame (19) which is mounted so as to be
displaceable on guide columns (20) connected to the guide frame (14) and

extending in the longitudinal direction of the machine and horizontally and
parallel to the top of the rail, and in that the grinding unit (18) is connected

to the guide frame (14) by means of a drive mechanism (21) for producing
an oscillating working movement superimposed on the advancing movement

of the machine (1).
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the flanged
rollers (15) are designed for vertical adjustment relative to the guide frame

(14) by means of a drive (16) and the said guide frame can be acted upon
with a vertical load by means of the vertical adjustment drives (17).
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the tool
frame (19) is connected by way of a connecting rod (24) to an eccentric

drive (22) fixed to the guide frame (14) and designed as a drive mechanism
(21).
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the supply- and collecting reels (26,27) are designed so as to be lockable

and rotatable in each case about a horizontal axis (29) extending in the
transverse direction of the machine and are arranged one above the other

in the vertical direction above the pressing member (28). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
guide rollers (31) for guiding the grinding band (25) are provided on the tool

frame (19).
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
pressing member (28) is designed as a pressing shoe (32) extending in the

longitudinal direction of the machine and parallel to the rail (10), the said
pressing shoe having on a contact surface (33) with the grinding band (25)

a cross-sectional profile (38) corresponding to the desired cross-sectional
profile of the rail head surface (9).
A machine according to claim 6, characterized in that the contact
surface (33) of the pressing shoe (32) extends beyond the rounded edges

(37) of the head of the rail (10) to the vertical region of the rail head flanks
(34).
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
provided immediately preceding and following the pressing shoe (32), with

respect to the longitudinal direction of the machine, are respective double
flanged rollers (35) for longitudinally guiding the grinding band (25), these

being rotatable in each case about an axis (36) extending in the transverse
direction of the machine and - in the operating position of the grinding unit

(18) - being situated a small distance away from the rail head surface (9).
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that
the guide frame (14) is provided with two grinding units (18) arranged one

following the other in the longitudinal direction of the machine and each
having its own grinding band (25) and its own drive mechanism (21).
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that a
braking device (30) is associated with the supply reel (26) and a motor (39)

is associated with the collecting reel (27) to produce rotation about the axis
(29).
