<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a prescribed pattern on a layer of 
a semiconductor device, comprising the steps of:

 
   preparing a substrate (40) having a first main 

surface;
 

   forming a first layer (41) on the first main surface;
 

   forming a second layer (42) on the first layer;
 

   forming a third layer (43) on the second layer;
 

   selectively removing the third layer to form a first 
patterned layer;

 
   immersing the substrate having the first patterned 

layer into a predetermined solution to form a fourth 
layer (45) selectively over the portions of the second 

layer uncovered by the first patterned layer;
 

   removing the first patterned layer; and

 
   etching the second layer using the fourth layer (45) 

as a mask,
 

   characterised in that the first layer (41) is an 
insulating layer, the second layer (42) is a metal 

layer, third layer (43) is a photoresist layer, and the 
fourth layer is a Si0₂ layer, whereby the remainder of 

the second layer (42) constitutes a metal interconnect 
layer for the semiconductor device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for forming a prescribed
pattern of, e.g., a wiring layer by etching, on a
semiconductor device.Conventionally, for etching a semiconductor substrate, a
Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) is utilized using a photoresist
pattern formed on the semiconductor substrate as a mask.FIG.1 is a diagram for explaining a problem which is
present in a conventional process for forming a pattern of
submicron dimensions using a conventional exposure and
development technique.
Namely, in the case where the width between the adjacent
pattern is relatively wide, e.g. 1.0 µm, a desired pattern
may be obtained by the conventional technique. However, in
the case where the width is 0.8 µm (e.g., between the
photoresist pattern 12 and 13), some undeveloped photoresist
remains on the substrate 10, since the bottom portion of the
photoresist is not sufficiently exposed even if the upper
portion is clearly patterned. Thus, it is difficult to use
the photoresist pattern 12 and 13 as a mask in a subsequent
etching process.FIGS.2A and 2B are diagrams for explaining a problem in a
conventional process for forming a prescribed pattern of a
high reflective metal layer 21 in a recessed portion 24 of a
semiconductor substrate 20. In the conventional process, a 
material of high reflectivity, such as a tungsten
silicide 21, is formed. A photoresist layer 23 is then
formed thereon (Fig. 2A). Next, an exposure and a
development are carried out to form a photoresist
pattern 23a and 23b. By this process, a desired pattern
23a and 23b of photoresist may be formed on a flat
surface of the substrate 20. However, at the level
difference portion 24, the reflected light from the
angled surface 22 of the metal layer 21 exposes the
photoresist 23 in the recess. Thus, the desired pattern
illustrated by the dotted line 23c cannot be obtained,
and a photoresist pattern 23d may result instead.
Therefore, it is also difficult to use the pattern 23d
as a mask to etch the metal layer 21 accurately.It is known from U.S. Patent No. 4599137 to provide a
method, as defined in the pre-characterizing portion of
Claim 1, of forming a resist micropattern in a
semiconductor device manufacturing process. Further,
U.S. Patent No. 4624 749 discloses the use of a metal
(gold) as an interconnect layer, formed by
gold-electroplating selectively over a photoresist
pattern which is complementary to the desired gold
interconnect pattern.An object of the present invention is to provide an
improved method which results in a desired accurate
photoresist
