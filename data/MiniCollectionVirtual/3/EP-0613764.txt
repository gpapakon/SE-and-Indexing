<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides apparatus for use in the preparation 
of gypsum products such as plasterboard from foamed gypsum 

plaster slurry. The apparatus comprises a first mixing chamber 
10 containing a high speed rotor 14 and inlets for 18, 19 for 

gypsum plaster and water. The initial dispersion of gypsum 
plaster and water foamed in the first chamber passes directly and 

continuously into a second chamber 25 containing a low speed 
rotor 29. Preformed foam is introduced into the second chamber 

through an inlet 33, and the foamed slurry product leaves the 
second chamber through an outlet 34, to be formed into 

plasterboard. 
A method of making gypsum products from foamed gypsum 
plaster slurry is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mixer for preparing aerated
slurries of gypsum plaster (calcium sulphate hemihydrate) in a
liquid, for use in the preparation of gypsum products, most notably
plasterboard, gypsum panels and the like.It has been common practice for many years to employ
horizontal rotary mixers for the preparation of aerated slurries in
the production of plasterboard and other gypsum products of
relatively low density. Such mixers comprise a relatively wide and
shallow cylindrical housing, which accommodates a generally
circular horizontal rotor and is provided with inlets for gypsum
plaster, water and a preformed aqueous foam, together with other
possible additives. Examples of such mixers are shown in US-A-2 639 901
and US-A-3 343 818, in both of which intermeshing pins are provided
respectively on the rotor and the top wall of the housing.In the preparation of slurries for the manufacture of
plasterboard and similar products it is desirable that the gypsum
plaster should be highly dispersed in the aqueous medium since this
helps in developing strength in the set gypsum. It is also
preferred that the air entrained in the slurry should be evenly
dispersed in the form of small bubbles. Mixers currently in use
give satisfactory gypsum plaster dispersion but tend to give uneven
distribution of air, leading to the presence of significant voids
in the set gypsum and to a relatively low level of incorporation of
air in the slurry.DE-A-1 278 917 discloses a method for making cellular concrete
components in which the solid components are homogenised in a
rapidly rotating mixing machine and then passed to a second mixing
machine where foam is added. US-A-1 660 243 discloses apparatus
for making cellular gypsum components in which plaster and water
are mixed in a first mixing chamber and the resulting slurry is
passed to a second mixing chamber in which coloidalised water and 
air are introduced into the mixture. CH-A-134547 discloses a
method of making a cellular cement in which cement is aerated in a
first mixer to create small bubbles by working the mass at high
speed with rotary members and injecting air into the mass. The
aerated mass is passed to a second mixer where it is worked at high
speed and air is injected in such a way as to form large bubbles so
that the resulting mass has both large and small bubbles. The
apparatus' and methods of these three disclosures can all be
expected to degrade the foam or bubbles introduced into the
cementitious material, resulting in an uneven

A method of preparing gypsum products which comprises:

(i) preparing a foamed slurry of a gypsum plaster
comprising:


(a) dispersing in a first mixing chamber gypsum plaster in
a liquid medium at a first shear to produce an initial dispersion;
(b) directly and continuously transferring the initial
dispersion produced in step (a) to a second mixing

chamber;
(c) blending the initial dispersion in a second mixing
chamber with a foam at a second shear lower than the said first

shear; and
(ii) forming the foamed slurry into a gypsum product.
A method according to claim 1 in which a mixing rotor is in
each mixing chamber and in which the rotor in the first chamber

rotates with a peripheral speed of between 10 and 50 m/s and the
rotor in the second chamber rotates with a peripheral speed of

between 0.1 and 10 m/s.
A method according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the foam is formed
prior to blending with the initial dispersion.
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein at least one
additive or other ingredient is added in step (b).
Apparatus for the preparation of a foamed slurry of gypsum
plaster for use in the preparation of gypsum products which

comprises: a first mixing chamber (10) containing a first mixing
rotor (14) adapted to be driven at a first speed to develop a first

shear and having inlets (18)(19) for the gypsum plaster and for a
liquid (such as water) and an outlet (20) for the resulting initial 

dispersion; a second mixing chamber (25) containing a second mixing
rotor (29) adapted to be driven at a second speed lower than the

said first speed to develop a second shear lower than the said
first shear and having inlets (20)(33) for the initial dispersion

of the gypsum plaster and for a foam component and an outlet (34)
fo
r foamed slurry, the outlet of the first mixing chamber being
disposed to deliver the initial dispersion slurry directly into the

corresponding inlet of the second mixing chamber, the volume of the
first mixing chamber (10) being greater than that of the second

mixing chamber (25), the ratio of the volumes being within the range of about 1:1 to
5:1.
Apparatus according to claim 5 including an inlet for
additives or other ingredients in the portion of the apparatus

providing the second mixing zone (25).
Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6 wherein the first mixing
rotor (14) is a disc mounted for rotation about an axis passing

substantially perpendicularly through its centre.
Apparatus according to claim 5, 6 or 7 in which the inlet (33)
into the second chamber (25) is an inlet for a previously formed

foam.
