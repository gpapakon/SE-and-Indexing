<ABSTRACT>
A length of elongate material such as rubber 
hose (120) is supported and guided while being fed along a 

desired path of travel (108) that extends through the hollow 
interior of a tubular structure (100). The tubular 

structure (100) mounts an array of relatively closely 
spaced rollers (225) that project into the hollow interior 

to guide and support the moving length of material (120). 
The tubular structure (100) is formed as a "tube within a 

tube" assembly of "outer" and "inner" tubular members 
(130, 140) that closely interfit, and that sandwich roller 

support pins (195) between overlying portions of the outer 
and inner tubular members (130, 140). The roller support 

pins (195) bridge roller positioning holes (145) that are 
formed through the inner tubular member (130) at an array 

of spaced locations. The rollers (225) are rotatably 
mounted by the support pins (195) and project through the 

positioning holes (145) into the hollow interior of the 
tubular structure (100) to engage outer surface portions 

of such elongate material (120) as is being fed through 
the tubular structure (100) to prevent the moving material 

(120) from contacting stationary portions of the tubular 
structure (100). In preferred practice, a funnel-like 

roller-carrying end assembly (250) is provided near one 
end of the tubular structure (100) to define a constricted 

discharge opening (286) through which the moving material 
(120) discharges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
use of a tubular assembly positioned to extend along a 
desired path of travel to guide and support movement 
through the hollow interior of the assembly of a length of 
elongate material that is fed along the travel path. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to tubular 
structure for guiding and supporting the movement of a 
length of material along a path of travel that extends 
through the hollow interior of the tubular structure.  
 To the extent that previously proposed tubular 
support structures have made use of various types of rotatable 
elements such as rollers for engaging outer surface 
portions of lengths of material that are'being fed along 
desired paths of travel (for example 
GB-A-2 243 027), such proposals typically have 
been characterized by a number of drawbacks, not the least 
of which have involved failures to provide simple and inexpensive 
guide and support structures that are relatively 
easy to assemble, relatively easy to maintain, and relatively 
easy to disassemble and service when replacement 
parts need to be installed. During the production of elongate articles of 
indefinite length, such as reinforced hose of the type 
that typically is used to provide flexible conduits for 
pressurized fluids, there frequently arises a need to  
 
support and guide the movement of partially assembled hose 
material as it is fed along selected paths of travel between 
spaced workstations. Often it is desirable to protectively 
shroud the partially assembled hose material 
while it is being supported, guided and fed between workstations. 
While some travel-path-enshrouding guide and 
support structures have been proposed, most are not well 
suited for use with flexible rubber hose material that has 
a "tacky" outer surface that needs to be relatively gently 
guided and supported without having its "tacky" outer surface 
deleteriously affected as can occur if portions of 
its outer surface are permitted to "slide" along or "drag" 
against stationary structure. To the extent that previously proposed tubular, 
travel-path-enshrouding guide and support structures have 
made use of various types of rotatable elements such as 
rollers for engaging outer surface portions of lengths of 
material that are being fed along desired paths of travel, 
such proposals typically have proven to be unacceptable 
for use with lengths of material such as a length of newly 
formed flexible rubber hose that has a "tacky" outer surface.
