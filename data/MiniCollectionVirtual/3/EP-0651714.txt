<ABSTRACT>
A locking unit for a missile launching device comprises a pivoting pawl (10). The pawl (10) has two locking lugs (16, 18) to clamp a shoe (22) on the missile. The pawl (10) is preloaded by a spring (24) towards a locking position in which the shoe (22) of the missile is held by the lugs (16, 18). A locking lug (26) on the pawl (10) co-operates with a safety pawl (10) against which the locking lug (26) bears in the locked position. The pawl (10) is thus held in the locked position in which the shoe (22) is gripped by the lugs (16, 18). A safety pin (32) can be fitted through a housing (34) of the locking unit with the pawl (10) in the locked position. This provides a check whether the system has been properly fitted and the pawl is in the correct position. To prevent errors during this check, there is a connecting link (38) on the pawl (10) projecting into the path of the safety pin (32) if the pawl (10) is not in its proper locking position.

Locking assembly for locking a shoe, which is provided 
at a missile, in a launcher, comprising 


(a) a pivotally mounted blocking latch (10), which is 
provided with two blocking lugs (16,18), which 

serve to extend over the shoe provided at the 
missile, 
(b) a spring (24) which biases the blocking latch (10) 
towards its blocking position, 
(c) a locking lug (26) provided at the blocking latch 
(10) and a safety latch (30) which is engaged by 

the locking lug (26) in the blocking position, if 
acceleration forces act on the blocking latch (10), 

whereby the blocking latch (10) is retained in its 
blocking position, and 
(d) a safety pin (32), which, in the blocked state of 
the blocking latch (10) can be pushed through a 

housing (34) of the locking assembly and which is 
engaged by the blocking latch (10), 
characterized in that
(e) a contact surface (38) is provided on the blocking 
latch (10) and extends into the path of the safety 

pin (32), if the blocking latch (10) is not in its 
correct blocking position. 
A locking assembly as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
(a) the blocking latch (10) is arranged in a housing 
(34), which has a bottom provided with an aperture 

(48), and is supported with an edge portion (50) on 
the bottom adjacent to the aperture, 
(b) the blocking lugs (16,18) extend through the 
aperture (48) of the bottom, and 
(c) the blocking latch (10) has an elongated hole (12) 
therethrough, through which a transverse bolt (14) 

mounted in the housing (34) extends. 
A locking assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 the contact surface (38) is 
formed by a separate component, which is connected to 

the blocking latch by material connecting means. 
A locking assembly as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the material connecting means is a welding 
connection. 
A locking assembly as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the material connecting means is a soldering 
connection. 
A locking assembly as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the material connecting means is a cementing 
connection. 
A locking assembly as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 
to 6, 
characterized in that
(a) the blocking latch (10) is arranged to be rotated 
from a locking position into a
 loading position by 
a positioning lever (40) non-positively engaging a 

cam surface (58) of the blocking latch (10), the 
end (56) of the positioning lever (40) engaging the 

cam surface (58) moving along the cam surface (58) 
during the rotary movement, and 
(b) the cam surface (58) of the blocking latch (10) 
forms a travel limit by which the movement of the 

positioning lever (40) along the cam surface (58) 
and, thereby, the rotary movement of the blocking 

latch (10) is limited. 
A locking assembly as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized 
in that
 the contact surface is a lug (54) provided at 
the blocking latch, which contact surface 


defines a surface (36) on a first side thereof 
which is engaged by the safety pin (32), 
defines the cam surface (58) on its second side 
opposite the first side, 
the cam surface (58) ending in a projecting end 
(62) defining the travel limit. 
A locking assembly as claimed in claims 2 and 8, 

characterized in that
, in the loading position, the 
transverse pin (14) is spaced from the bottom side end 

of the elongated hole (12). 
A locking assembly as claimed in anyone of the claims 3 
to 6, 
characterized in that
 the contact surface (38) is 
a u-profile part attached to the blocking latch (10).
