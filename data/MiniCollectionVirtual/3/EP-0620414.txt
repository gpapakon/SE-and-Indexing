<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
an apparatus for measuring angular velocity, a corresponding
vibration member, an application within an image anti-blur
mechanism of a camera, and a corresponding method, Claims 1, 10-12.A vibration gyro is known as one of means for
detecting an angular velocity. Based on the principle
that "a Coriolis force is produced when an angular
velocity is applied to an object with a velocity", the
vibration gyro adds a vibration to the object to cause
it to have a velocity, receives the Coriolis force
produced when an angular velocity is applied to the
object, and detects the Coriolis force proportional to
the angular velocity entered as a displacement of the
spring system, thus detecting an angular velocity
applied to the object.An object of this vibration gyro which applies a
vibration, that is, a vibration member is available in
a shape of a tuning fork or a H-shape. However, the
conventional vibration gyro has a single vibration
member with a structure which permits mere detection of
rotation in a plane and an angular velocity applied to
the object.In detection of the angular velocity of a camera 
or other moving object on which the above conventional
single-axis type vibration gyro, not only a one-dimensional
angular velocity component but also two-dimensional
and three-dimensional components are
generally produced from the moving object. Therefore
the conventional vibration gyro which has only been
able to detect the angular velocity in a single-axis
direction is not suitable for precisely detecting the
angular velocity.Hence various types of vibration gyro capable of
detecting angular velocities of two-axis direction
components have been proposed. This two-axis type
vibration gyro has been disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 63-61114, No. 64-16911, No.
1-140013, No. 2-198315, No. 2-218914 and No. 4-25714.Fig. 16 shows a vibration gyro disclosed in
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 64-16911.The conventional vibration gyro shown in Fig. 16
is adapted to have H-shaped vibration members 1 and 2
which are assembled to orthogonally intersect each
other, apply an AC voltage to piezoelectric elements 4
and 5 connected to the sides of respective vibration
members 1 and 2 to vibrate these vibration members 1
and 2 to give a velocity, and detect a distortion of
the Coriolis force in two axial directions as electro-mechanical
conversion signals from piezoelectric
elements 6 and 7 connected to two orthogonally 
intersecting sides of a square support bar 3
