<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a security-protected system for remote participation in interactive games, with verification of the chronology of events according to the invention, the system is based on counting, by a security-protected microprocessor (for example a microcircuit card), of consecutive time intervals the first of which (Tr12) is initialized by a cryptographically security-protected message sent by the sender, and the last of which (Ta15) is terminated by connection of the game apparatus to the server of the sender in order to pass on the proof of the response therein. Application to televised interactive games.

Security-protected system for remote 
participation in interactive games comprising a 

transmitting server centre (1) transmitting cryptographic 
messages which are received by television receivers (40) 

during the broadcast of a television programme and 
wherein the viewers have a game device (40, L1) capable 

of reading the televised messages and sending back a 
reply to the questions asked in these messages, 

characterised in that: 

a) the game device (40, L1) comprises: 

means (100, 150) for counting two consecutive time 
intervals, the first interval Tr12 being defined by the 

instant T1 at which a message is transmitted by the 
server centre and the instant T2 at which a reply is sent 

back by the viewer and the second interval Tr25 being 
defined by the instant T2 at which the viewer responds 

and the instant T5 at which the response is picked up by 
the server (1), 
means (30) for transmitting the response and 
these time-count results to the transmitting server (1), 
b) the server (1) comprises: 

means for counting (20) a time interval Ta35 
defined by the instant T3 marking the response and the 

instant T5 at which the response is picked up and a time 
interval Ta15 defined by the instant T1 at which the 

message is transmitted and the instant T5 at which the 
response is picked up, 
computing and verification means (20) for 
verifying the following relations:
 
   Tr25 
>
 Ta35
 
and 

Tr12 + Tr25 = Ta15 ± pre-set tolerances,
 
and for rejecting the response if these relations are not 

verified. 
Security-protected system for remote 
participation in interactive games as claimed in claim 1, 

characterised in that the counting means of the game 
device consist of a security-protected micro-processor 

(100), which is driven by a clock (150) and implements a 
programme which counts clock pulses. 
Security-protected system for remote 
participation in interactive games as claimed in claim 1, 

characterised in that the counting means of the game 
device consist of computing means which are driven by an 

internal clock and implement a programme which counts 
clock pulses. 
Device enabling participation in television 
broadcasts and certification of such participation by AA 

link-up to a remote server (1) comprising: 

means (30) for receiving digital data from the 
server (1), 
interface means (L1) for the input by a 
participant of data representing his participation, 
means (30) for establishing a connection to the 
server, 
at least one security-protected electronic 
component (CS) having a micro-processor (100) and memory 

means (110, 120, 130) thereof, 
at least one clock-signal generating circuit 
(150), characterised in that: 
the receiver means are designed to receive, at an 
instant T1, a digital message in a pre-determined form 

and, on receipt thereof, communicate it to the security-protected 
micro-processor (100), 
the security-protected micro-processor (100) is 
designed to verify the authenticity of this message so as 

to record it in the memory thereof and to enable the 
counting of time units proportional to the clock signal 

communicated to it by the clock-signal generating circuit  
 

(150), 
the interface means are designed to receive, at an 
instant T2, from the viewer holding this device, the data 

pertaining to his participation and to communicate these 
to the security-protected micro-processor (100), which is 

designed to record them in a format requirement by its 
memory and to record in addition the value of the time-count 

up to that instant and then calculate and record 
the interval Tr12 between T1 and T2, 
the security-protected micro-processor (100) is 
designed to continue counting until the device (40, L1) 

has been placed in contact by the connection means (30) 
with the server (1) at an instant T5 and to calculate and 

record the time interval Tr25 between T2 and T5, 
the security-protected micro-processor (100) is so 
designed that, once connection has been established, it 

transmits the participation data stored in memory and the 
time intervals Tr12 and Tr25 so that the server can 

verify whether these intervals are compatible with its 
ow
n calculations of the interval T15 between T1 and T5 
and rejects the response if such is not the case. 
Device (40, L1) for participating in televised 
programmes as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that 

it comprises chip-card reading means (L1) and a chip card 
(C), the card having the security-protection component in

a micro-processor (100) and working and programme 

memories (100, 110, 120). 
Data-processing server device (1) designed for 
managing the participation of an audience of television 

viewers in televised scenarios, the television viewers 
requiring for this purpose individual electronic 

participation devices (40, L1) capable of reading 
messages broadcast by television and sending back replies 

from the television viewers in response to the questions  
 

asked in these messages, the device (1) comprising: 

means (20) for counting time, 
means (10) for broadcasting digital messages

the broadcasting means (10) are so designed that 
at the instant at which a new televised scenario is 

initialised, a digital message addressed to the

T1 and time-counting means (20) are initialised and 

triggered, 
the memory processing means (21, 22) are so 
designed that at the pre-determined instant T3, selected 

as being the instant at which the audience must no longer 
participate in the scenario, the value of the time 

counted is stored in memory and counting continues, 
the computing and verification means (20) are

   Ta35 is the time interval calculated by the device 
between T3 and T5,
