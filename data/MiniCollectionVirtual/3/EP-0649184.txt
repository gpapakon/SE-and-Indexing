<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor substrate having an integrated antenna element is mounted upside down on a carrier plate, which is highly thermally conductive, for an arrangement for radiating millimetric waves. For its part, this carrier plate is connected to a heat sink in a highly thermally conductive manner. A cavity resonator is constructed in the heat sink. The efficiency of the semiconductor component can be improved by the rapid dissipation of the heat lost from the semiconductor component, from the substrate into the heat sink.

Arrangement for the radiation of millimetre waves with an active semiconductor
component on a substrate, an antenna element and a cavity resonator, characterised by

the following features:

a) the cavity resonator is constructed in a heat sink,
b) the side of the substrate carrying the semiconductor component faces the
resonator,
c) a carrier plate of material having good thermal conductivity is arranged between
the substrate and the heat sink, and
d) substrate, plate and heat sink are connected together in a manner with good
thermal conductivity.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the carrier plate has
a break-through between antenna element and cavity resonator.
Arrangement according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the walls of the
break-through and the side of the carrier plate facing the resonator are continuously

electrically conductive.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that the
thermal conductivity of the material of the carrier plate is greater than 1 W/cm.K.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that the
thermal conductivity of the material of the carrier plate is greater than that of the substrate

material.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby that the heat
sink is a plate with a cylindrical passage opening, which is closed at the side remote from

the carrier plate by an electrically conductive closure foil. 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby that the
substrate is an IMPATT diode and an integrated slot antenna.
