<ABSTRACT>
A sheet media realignment mechanism (10) is described for use in, 
for example, a printer. Preferably, the mechanism includes a lever (22) located 

in the sheet-feeding path adjacent and beneath a rotatable member (15) that 
mounts a plurality of sheet-feeding rollers (16, 18, 20). At the beginning of a 

sheet-feeding cycle, the lever is urged from its extreme upstream pivotal 
orientation by a pivot-mounted strut (12) into a downstream orientation in which 

a top sheet (S1) of the printer's infeed stack is fed by frictional forces into the 
feed zone (30). Upon release of the lever (22) by the strut (12) at a predefined 

pivotal orientation of the rotatable member (15), the lever (22) is urged farther 
into an extreme downstream orientation by the sheet being advanced. After the 

sheet (S1) passes by, the lever (22) is returned to its extreme upstream orientation 
in which it urges upstream and away from the printer's feed zone (30) any sheets 

(S2, S3) of the stack that inadvertently may have been dislodged and partly 
advanced downstream and toward the feed zone (30) by frictional forces between 

the fed sheet (S1) and those beneath it (S2, S3). Thus, the lever (22) realigns the 
sheets of the paper stack after each single-sheet feed into the printer or other 

sheet media-processing equipment to permit the addition of sheets to the top of 
the stack without pulling the stack away from the feed zone (30) and to reduce 

the likelihood of undesirable multiple-sheet picks and feeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to paper or other sheet 
media-feeding mechanisms. More particularly, the invention relates to equipping 
a sheet-feeding subsystem that is subject to inadvertent multiple sheet picks with 
a pivotal 'kick' lever that automatically realigns the leading edges of the top 
sheets in the paper sheet infeed stack, thereby better to control single sheet 
feeding. Previously, inadvertent multiple picks of the top few sheets of paper 
in an infeed mechanism have been reduced to some extent by, for example, 
supplying a frictional force against those sheets beneath the top sheet in the 
infeed stack. One such mechanism is described in EP-A-590 824, 
which constitues prior art under Article 54(3) PCT. Described therein is a pivotally-operable, spring-returnable separator 
located adjacent and beneath the infeed rollers of a sheet pick mechanism of an 
ink-jet printer, the separator having a wear-resistant, upstanding portion 
rearwardly adjacent a frictionally adherent pad. The separator's pad opposes 
advancement of a next-to-top sheet in the infeed paper stack while the top sheet 
of the stack is pulled thereacross by one or more rollers. While such a separator 
pad is effective in opposing advancement of a next-to-top sheet, there typically 
remains undesirable advancement, of the media sheets below the top sheet that 
has just been advanced for printing, toward the feed zone, resulting in an uneven 
leading, or 'downstream', or 'forward', top edge of the paper sheet stack.  
 Slidable stacked-paper input trays for printers have been proposed, 
wherein the trays have manual means for grippingly capturing the entire paper 
stack when the tray is pulled away from the printer's feed zone. Such an 
improved tray is described in U.S.-A-5277418. 
(=EP-A-592 116 which is also an Article 54(3) document). 
The paper capture means described 
and illustrated therein is marginally effective in preventing multiple picks, since 
the top few unevenly advanced sheets also are captured and removed from the 
feed zone. Unfortunately, it requires that the tray be fully extended any time it 
is desired to add paper to the tray. The invented sheet realignment mechanism, as specified in the claims hereinafter, 
includes a 'kick' lever located in the sheet-feeding path adjacent and beneath a pivot that mounts a 
plurality of sheet-feeding rollers. At the beginning of a sheet-feeding cycle, the 
lever is urged by a pivot-mounted strut from a relatively 'rearward', or 
'upstream', nominal rest

A sheet media realignment mechanism (10) in media feed 
equipment, the realignment mechanism (10) comprising a rotatable sheet 

pick/feed mechanism (15) defining adjacent thereto a single sheet media feed

moveable frictional expanses for engaging a top sheet (S1) in a plural-sheet 
media 

stack; a pivotable member (14) operatively coupled with said pick/feed 
mechanism (15) for at least partial rotation therewith; said pivotable member (14) 

having connected therewith a generally radially extending strut (12); a drive 
mechanism for rotating said pivotable member (14) with a predefined first force 

into various predefined rotational orientations of said pivotable member (14) 
including a first sheet-feeding orientation; a pivotal lever (22) extending into said 

feed zone (30), said lever (22) nominally traversing said feed zone (30), said lever 
(22) being temporarily urged by said strut (12), upon rotation of said pivotable 

member (14), into a non-obstructing orientation that permits feeding by said 
pick/feed mechanism (15) of the top sheet (S1) of the stack by engagement of the 

top sheet (S1) with said expanses; and a return mechanism (26) operatively 
connected with said lever (22) for returning said lever (22) to said nominally 

obstructing position within said feed zone (30) upon rotation by said drive 
mechanism of said pivotable member (14) into said first orientation, said lever

comprises a separator pad (24) closely adjacent said expanses when said pivotal 

member (14) is in said first orientation, said pad (24) having a friction-promoting
