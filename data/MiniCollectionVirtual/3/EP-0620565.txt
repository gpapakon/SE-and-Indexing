<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a radiating radio-frequency cable (1) having a tubular inner conductor (2) and a tubular outer conductor (3) which is concentric thereto, is held at a distance by insulation (4) and has openings arranged along the cable (1), the inner conductor (2) contains at least one optical fibre (6).

<CLAIMS>
Coaxial high-frequency cable with a tubular metallic inner
conductor and a tubular metallic outer conductor maintained

in a fixed spatial position relative to one another
by a separating insulator, where the tubular outer conductor

is provided with apertures along the length of the cable
for radiating electromagnetic energy, characterised in

that the metallic inner conductor (9) is formed from a
casing tube of an optical waveguide element (12) comprising

a longitudinally welded metal strip and that at least
one optical fibre (13) is loosely inserted into the casing

tube.
High-frequency cable in accordance with Claim 1, characterised
in that the casing tube of the optical waveguide

element (12) contains a plurality of loosely inserted optical
fibres (13) with an excess length of more than 5â€°.
High-frequency cable in accordance with Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the diameter of the casing tube is

less than 2 mm.
High-frequency cable in accordance with one of the claims
1 to 3, characterised in that the casing forming the inner

conductor (9) is corrugated.
Made-up high-frequency cable in accordance with one of the
claims 1 to 4 with a plug connection at the end of the cable,

which has a peg extending concentrically to a longitudinal
axis of the plug, a plug receptacle radially separated

from the latter and at least partially surrounding
it in an axial direction and an adaptor sleeve connected 

with the plug receptacle for holding the plug connector to
the end of the cable, characterised in that a guide channel

(48) is provided in the plug connection (16) for
bringing out at least one of the optical fibres (13) disposed

within the tubular inner conductor (9) of the coaxial
high-frequency cable (8) and that the guide channel

(48) emerging from the peg (19) compared with the longitudinal
axis of the plug (18) is inclined obliquely outwards

in the direction of the adaptor sleeve (31).
High-frequency cable in accordance with Claim 5, characterised
in that the guide channel (48) extends through the

peg (19) and the plug receptacle (23).
High-frequency cable in accordance with Claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that the annular space between the peg

(19) and the plug receptacle (23) is filled with an insulator
(25) and that the guide channel (48) extends through

this insulator (25).
High-frequency cable in accordance with one of the claims
5 to 7, characterised in that the peg (19) and the plug

receptacle (23) is coated with a plastic in the region of
the guide channel (48) extending through it.
