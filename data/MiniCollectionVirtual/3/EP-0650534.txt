<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the continous galvanisation of steel strip, with a pair of blow-off nozzles downstream of at least a guide roller (5) which can be fed with a blow-off medium, especially compressed air, between the nozzle bodies (2) of which the strip (1) is guided at a distance from the nozzle slots extending transversely to the direction of travel of the strip. In order to improve the uniformity of the coating, in a first embodiment of the invention there is allocated to one of the two nozzle bodies (2) an optical measuring instrument (4) to detect the distance between the nozzle slot (3) and the surface of the metal strip, the output signal of which can be fed to the adjusting device for the guide roller (5) and/or that for the nozzle body (2) in such a way that the distance between the nozzle slot (3) and the surface of the metal strip can take a predetermined value. In a second embodiment of the invention, the optical measuring instrument (4, 4a, 4b) can be moved parallel to the nozzle slot covering at least the region of an edge (K) of the metal strip and the opposite nozzle body (2) has a reflector (18) on which the optical axis (a) of the measuring instrument (4b, 4) is directed in its position outside the edge (K) of the metal strip.
