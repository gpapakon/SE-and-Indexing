<ABSTRACT>
The device has two rotating sealing jaws (4) which subdivide a tubular foil into individual bags (8). One sealing jaw possesses centrally a zigzag-shaped knife. The other sealing jaw (4) has a corresponding stay (10). Recesses (20) are made in this sealing jaw. As a result of axial displacements, these recesses (20) can be displaced selectively into the region or outside the region of the knife during cutting, so that connecting webs (12) remain or a continuous severing cut is made. As a result, groups having any number of interconnected bags (8) can be formed in a simple way and so as to treat the products carefully.

Device for the purpose of producing tubular-bag packages (8), which are 
interconnected in groups, for individual products (6), comprising in each case a 

longitudinal seal seam (30) and two transverse seal seams (7) which are separated 
approximately in the middle apart from at least two remaining connecting bridge 

pieces (12) by virtue of a separating cut (11), and comprising a rotating cutting knife 
(9) for the purpose of cutting the separating cuts (11), which cutting knife cooperates 

with a likewise rotating counter-holder (10), characterised in that the counter-holder 
(10) has at least two recesses (20) which, during the circulation of the knife (9) and 

counter-holder (10), can be displaced by virtue of relative movement between the 
two, so as to cover and not cover the knife (9) during the cutting procedure, wherein 

the counter-holder (10) can be displaced relatively with respect to the knife (9) in an 
axial manner into two positions, and wherein the knife (9) contains at least two 

portions which form an acute angle with the direction of travel (A). 
Grouped-tubular-bag package of products (6) produced using the device of claim 
1, wherein the grouped package is formed from a tubular sheet having a longitudinal 

seal seam (30) and transverse seal seams (7) between the products (6) and the 
transverse seal seams (7) comprise separating cuts (11) which are not continuous, 

so that at least two bridge pieces (12) connect the individual packages (8) together, 
characterised in that the bridge pieces (12) are disposed in the region of the portions 

of the separating cuts (11) which together with the longitudinal seal seam (30) 
include an acute angle. 
Package according to claim 2, wherein the separating cuts (11) are formed in a 
zig-zag manner. 
Package according to claim 2, wherein the separating cuts (11) are in the shape 
of a wavy line.  

 
Package according to claim 2, wherein the separating cuts (11) are linear and 
extend in an acute angled manner with respect to the longitudinal direction of the 

longitudinal seal seam (30)
