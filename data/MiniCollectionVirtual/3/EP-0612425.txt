<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a syringe pressure monitor
and, more particularly, to a reusable multiportioned pressure
monitoring device for attachment to a plunger portion of a
syringe.During the intravenous administration of various
pharmaceutical agents, a means of monitoring the force
applied to a syringe plunger or piston and therefore the
pressure generated on the fluids within the syringe is often
necessary. Various devices which allow for dose and delivery
time measurement have theretofore been provided.US-A-4547635 discloses a squeeze switch assembly which
is particularly adapted for inclusion in a stuffed toy. The
switch assembly has a housing that has some sort of
electrical mechanism within it, a cover plate attached to the
housing, a flat layer of resilient material attached to the
cover plate on the side opposite the housing, and a switch
plate attached to and covering the layer of resilient
material. A plunger is positioned within the housing such
that the plunger will move when force is applied to the
surface of the switch plate. Movement of the plunger
activates the electrical mechanism within the housing.GB-A-2089497 teaches a controller which is used with a
pump to control the pressure at which the pump delivers
medication to a patient. The device has a housing that
includes a conduit for fluid flow. The fluid pressure is
applied to a resilient means such as a diaphragm that moves
in accordance with the pressure in the conduit. The
diaphragm is connected by an activating arm to a sensor that
adjusts the operation of the pump in accordance with movement 
of the diaphragm as it senses the pressure within the
conduit.In FR-A-2347058 there is taught a pressure-indicating
syringe having a cylindrical barrel within which there is a
plunger assembly including a plunger shaft and a piston. The
syringe barrel has a pair of finger-engaging loops and the
outer end of the plunger shaft is formed with another finger-engaging
loop. The syringe is provided with an elastic
connection within the barrel of the syringe between the loop
on the plunger shaft and the piston enabling the piston to be
displaced relative to the loop an amount corresponding to the
pressure applied during the injection process.US-A-4340051 describes a finger-pressure cushioning and
indicating element for use with a syringe. The device has a
first section attachable to the pressure applying element of
the syringe plunger assembly, a second section engageable by
the user's finger and a yieldable connecting portion
intermediate the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pressure monitoring device (10; 60; 100; 140) for
use with a syringe having a plunger (22) slidable in a

syringe body and containing a fluid capable of exerting a
pressure, the pressure monitoring device (10; 60; 100;

140) comprising:

a. a shell portion (12; 62; 102; 142) having a first
end and a second end, the first end having an

inwardly extending means (28; 72; 120; 158) for
capture of a base portion (24) of a syringe plunger

(22);
b. a compression spring (34; 78; 110; 148) extending in
a direction from the first end of the shell portion

(12; 62; 102; 142) to the second end thereof within
the shell portion (12; 62; 102; 142) and being at

least partially compressed when the pressure
monitoring device (10) is installed on a syringe

plunger (22), the compression spring (34; 78; 110;
148) being arranged to undergo compression upon

application of pressure to the second end of the
shell portion (12; 62; 102; 142) against the

pressure of fluid in the syringe; and
c. an indicator means (40; 68; 26; 152) providing an
active electrically operated warning signal and a

power source (38; 70; 124; 154) within the shell
portion (12; 62; 102; 142) whereby compression of

the spring (34; 78; 110; 148) within the shell
portion (12; 62; 102; 142) due to an excessive use

of force upon administering an injection to a
patient causes said indicator means (40; 68; 126;

152) to come into contact with said power source
(38; 70; 124; 154) thus initiating a signal from the 

indicator means (40; 68; 126; 152) warning an
administrator that too much force has been used.
A pressure monitoring device according to claim 1,
wherein said indicator means comprises an indicator source

(40; 68; 126; 152) and a power source (38; 70; 124; 154).
A pressure monitoring device according to claim 1 or
claim 2, wherein said signal is a sound, sounds, color

change or light illumination.
