<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display device includes a display region (2) in 
which a plurality of liquid crystal display elements (10) are formed in a 

matrix and a peripheral region (3) enclosing the display region (2). The 
display region (2) includes gate lines (4) arranged in parallel with one 

another and reference voltage lines (9) each of which is formed between 
the gate lines (4) and serves as an electrode for a storage capacitor of 

each of the liquid crystal display elements (10). The peripheral region 
(3) includes connecting terminals (6) which are separated from each other 

by distance less than a distance between adjacent gate lines (4) in the 
display region (2). The connecting terminals (6) are arranged in groups. 

The gate lines (4) each connected to said connecting terminals (6). A 
short-circuit line (11) is formed along said peripheral region (3) so 

that the connecting terminals (6) are short-circuited. A conductor 
extending from the short-circuit line (11) is formed between a region (7) 

between the groups and the reference voltage lines (9) which face the 
region (7). This prevents dielectric breakdown for a storage capacitor of 

a liquid crystal display element connected to a predetermined gate line 
in a liquid crystal display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD) 
device. LCD devices are widely used as display devices in personal 
computers, word processors, etc. A typical LCD device includes two glass 
substrates with a liquid crystal material held between them. On one 
substrate, gate and data lines are formed so that they cross each other 
and a liquid crystal display element including a switching transistor and 
a display electrode is formed at each of the intersections of the gate 
and data lines. On the other substrate, a common electrode, a color 
filter, etc. are formed. Figure 3 shows the two glass substrates 31 and 32 of the typical 
liquid crystal display described above. Substrate 31 is divided into a 
display region 33 and a peripheral region 34. Gate lines 35 and data 
lines 36 are formed in the display region 33. Formed in the peripheral 
region 34 are gate line connecting terminals 37 which are separated from 
each other at a distance L2 smaller than a distance L1 between adjacent 
gate lines in the display region. Also formed in the peripheral region 
are data line connecting terminals 38 which are separated from each other 
at a distance L4 smaller than a distance L3 between the data lines in the 
display region. There is also formed in the peripheral region a short-circuit 
line 47 for causing all connection terminals to be short-circuited. 
The gate and data line connecting terminals 37 and 38 are 
arranged in a plurality of groups 37A, 37B, etc. and 38A, 38B, etc. 
Regions 39 and 40 each exist between adjacent groups. In regions 39 and 
40, positioning marks (not shown) for connecting a flexible circuit board 
to the connecting terminals 37 and 38 are formed. The short-circuit line 
47 on the glass substrate 31 is removed by cutting it along lines 41 
after both glass substrates 31 and 32 are overlapped. Figure 4 is an enlarged diagram of the section enclosed by dotted 
lines 42 in Figure 3. Formed between the adjacent gate lines 35 are 
reference voltage lines 43A, 43B, and 43C. Formed at each of the 
intersections of the gate and data lines 35 and 36 is a liquid crystal 
display element 44. Substrates 31 and 32 are sealed with a seal 48. 
Reference voltage lines 43A, 43B, and 43C each have connection parts 50A, 
50B, and 50C. Connection sections 50A, 50B, and 50C are connected to a  
 
connection line 49 through openings 51A, 51B, and 51C formed on an 
insulating layer which covers the whole surface of the glass substrate 
31. The connection line 49 is thus connected to the
