<ABSTRACT>
A stump-receiving socket (1) for an artificial limb 
has an elastic diaphragm (4b) that sealingly engages a 

patient's stump when the stump is fully received in the 
socket (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a prosthetic
socket for use in an artificial limb, and more particularly
to a suction socket of the type utilizing differential air
pressure to retain a prosthetic limb on a patient's residual
stump.Artificial limbs using suction sockets are in
widespread use today. These sockets are provided with a
one-way air valve so that, on placing the stump of the
patient's leg into the socket, the air is expelled from the
interior of the socket to the outside, thus creating a
partial vacuum in the airspace between the patient's stump
and the interior of the socket. The difference in pressure
between the atmospheric air outside the socket and the
vacuum within the socket holds the socket in place until air
is readmitted to the socket by opening the one-way valve.While suction sockets have been known since the
late 1800's, see, e.g., Parmelee U.S. Reissue Patent 1,907, and are
in widespread use today, they are not without substantial
disadvantages. A major pitfall of the suction socket is the
inability to provide an effective seal at the proximal open
end of the socket. Even if the socket is perfectly fitted
to the patient's stump, the stump will contract or shrink
during the course of the day, thereby permitting air to leak
into the socket, thereby reducing and in some cases
completely eliminating the differential air pressure between
the atmospheric air outside the socket and the airspace
between the patient's stump and the socket. A variety of 
techniques have been adopted to address this problem, such
as providing the patient with special socks to accommodate
for this shrinkage. However, in practice, the patient must
remove the prosthesis to apply the sock as suction is lost
during the day, which is certainly inconvenient.Another attempt to address this problem is the
provision of auxiliary suspension devices, such as belts or
the like, to hold the socket in place during the course of
the day. This simply adds to the weight and bulk of the
prosthesis and does not address the cause of the problem,
namely the loss of suction due to shrinkage of the patient's
stump.A stump receiving socket of the kind defined by the
precharacterizing features of claim 1 is known from the US-A-5
007 937.The present invention provides a self-adjusting
sealing member adjacent the proximal open end of the suction
socket. In accordance with the present invention, the self-adjusting
sealing member will maintain the seal between the
proximal open end of the socket and the patient's stump as
the stump

<CLAIMS>
A stump-receiving socket (1) for an artificial limb,
which comprises a tubular body member (1a) having an

open proximal end (5) and a closed distal end (3), a
valve (2) secured to said body member (1a) adjacent said

distal end and operable to allow air to escape from the
interior of said body member (1a) to the outside, and a

sealing member (4) carried by said body member (1a)
adjacent to and closing said proximal open end (5),

characterized in that said sealing number (4) comprises
an elastic diaphragm (4b) extending inwardly of said

body member (4) and having a central aperture for
receiving the stump of a patient's limb, said elastic

diaphragm (4b) being operable to sealingly engage the
stump when the stump is fully received in said body

member (1a).
The socket according to claim 1, wherein said sealing
member (4) is detachably secured to said body member

(1a).
The socket according to claim 1, wherein said body
member (1a) has an interior wall having a groove (1b)

for receiving said sealing member (4).
The socket according to claim 1, wherein said tubular
body member (1a) has a circular cross-section and said

sealing member (4) is a circular sealing member.
The socket according to claim 4, wherein said sealing
member (4) comprises a circular outer rim (4a) and said 

elastic diaphragm (4b) extends inwardly of said rim
(4a).
The socket according to claim 5, wherein said elastic
diaphragm (4b) is composed of an elastomeric material,

said outer rim (4a) comprises a flexible ring (21), and
said flexible ring (6) is covered by the same

elastomeric material as said elastic diaphragm (4b).
The socket according to claim 6, wherein said elastic
diaphragm (4b) is integral with said covering of said

flexible ring.
The socket according to claim 5, wherein said body
member (1a) has an interior wall having a groove (1b)

for receiving said outer rim (4a) of said sealing member
(4).
