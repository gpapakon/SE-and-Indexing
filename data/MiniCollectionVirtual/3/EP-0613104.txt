<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
a bank note 
qualification device according to claim 1 and to an exchange machine according to claim 4. A plurality of game machines and game media lending 
machines for lending game media used in the games are disposed 
in the game parlors. Specifically, the game machines and game 
media lending machines coexist and are grouped into rows of 
game machines. Such rows of game machines are referred to as "game machine 
islands". The game media include, for example, metal balls, 
medals and the like. These game machine islands are provided with bank note 
recovering machines for recovering bank notes which are inserted 
into game media lending machines in islands. The bank note 
recovering machines are adapted to accept the bank notes from 
each game media lending machine and to pass them to a common 
conveying line and finally to collect the bank notes at a given  
 
place in an island. At least one exchange machine is disposed in each game 
machine island. The exchange machine is used to exchange bank 
notes or coins with bank notes which may be paid for lending of 
the game media in the above mentioned game media lending 
machine. In the exchange machine, the bank notes which are 
recovered by the bank note recovering machines are reused for 
exchange. The bank notes which are recovered by the bank note 
recovering machine have heretofore been manually inserted into 
an exchange machine by clerks of the parlor. The bank notes 
inserted into the exchange machine are dispensed, when a player 
echanges money, for being inserted into the game media lending 
machine. This causes the bank notes to be returned to the 
exchange machine. In other words, the bank notes are circulated 
between the game media lending machine and the exchange 
machines. Repetition of such circulations causes the bank notes to be 
damaged, for example, wrinkled or partially torn. Damaged bank 
notes causes jamming of the bank notes in a circulation path. 
Accordingly, it is necessary to examine whether or not the bank 
note which is recovered by the bank note recovering machine is 
damaged. Some of the bank notes are folded. Although folding per se is 
not damage to the bank note, it will be regarded as damage since 
it will cause jamming similarly to actual damage.  
 Such examination as to whether or not the bank notes are 
damaged has heretofore been made by clerks inspecting the 
condition of the bank notes one by one, for example, by sight or 
touch. Accordingly, it takes an extended period of
