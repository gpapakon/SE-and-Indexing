<ABSTRACT>
In a base station transmission-reception 
apparatus, each of baseband signal processing sections 

(1-1 to 1-N) includes a transmission signal selection 
circuit (202) for outputting a transmission signal from a 

transmission signal processing section (201) to a selected 
sector antenna (107) indicated by a selection signal, a 

reception signal selection circuit (204) for selecting a 
reception signal from a sector indicated by the selection 

signal, a reception signal processing section (203) for 
detecting reception data corresponding to its own 

communication channel from the reception signal from a 
reception signal selection circuit (204), and a control 

section (207) for providing the selection signal to the 
transmission signal selection circuit and the reception 

signal selection circuit. Further, each of collective 
modulation-demodulation sections (2-1 to 2-N) includes 

transmission processing means (301-305) for converting 
transmission signals into a transmission radio signal and 

supplying the transmission radio signal to the sector 
antennae, and frequency conversion means (306) for 

converting reception radio signals of a bandwidth 
corresponding to N communication channels collectively 

into a baseband signal by frequency conversion. An 
increase in the number of sectors does not increase the 

load to a control center arising from hand-over between 
sectors and does not increase the number of processing 

sections for each channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a base station
transmission-reception apparatus for use with an
automotive telephone system and a portable telephone
system (cellular system), and more particularly to a
base station transmission-reception apparatus wherein
interference of the same frequency as another cell is
reduced using a sector antenna.A base station transmission-reception apparatus
for a cellular system which handles a large number of
radio stations is disclosed in, for example, Moriji
Kuwabara, "Digital Mobile Communication," Science
Newspaper Company. The base station transmission-reception
apparatus disclosed in the document includes,
as shown in Fig. 1, a base station antenna 1, a common
amplifier 2 for collectively amplifying the power of a
plurality of radio channels, and a modulator-demodulator
3 for modulating and demodulating a digital
signal.A control center which communicates with the base 
station transmission-reception apparatus includes an
exchange 103 including a circuit control apparatus 104.
Where communications are performed using a digital signal,
a speech processing apparatus 101 and a base station
control apparatus 102 are provided between the base
station and the control center. However, they may be
provided in the base station and the control center.A base station transmission-reception apparatus
in urban areas which have a large amount of traffic adopts
a sector cell configuration wherein a directional antenna
is employed for base station antenna 1 in order to assure
a high frequency utilization efficiency. A three-sector
configuration wherein one cell is divided by 120 degrees
into three sectors and a six-sector configuration wherein
one cell is divided by 60 degrees into six sectors are in
practical use. The base station antenna 1 includes two
antennae including an antenna for common transmission and
reception and the other for diversity reception antenna
for each sector.The common amplifier 2 includes a transmission
amplifier 4 and a pair of outdoor reception amplifiers
2008 and 2009 for each sector as shown in Fig. 2. The
transmission amplifier 4 includes a transmission common
amplifier 41 for amplifying a transmission signal input
from a modulator-demodulator and outputting the thus
amplified signal to an outdoor reception amplifier 2008 by
way of an antenna feeder 2001, a power separator-filter 42
for filtering a reception signal from the outdoor
reception amplifier 2008 and outputting the thus filtered
signal as a reception signal to the modulator-demodulator,
and power
