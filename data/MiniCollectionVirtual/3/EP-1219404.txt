<ABSTRACT>
To form an extruded plastics tube (12), as it is extruded it is exposed to a water flow as a liquid or vapor at its inner or outer surfaces. The effect is to form cracks at the exposed surface in contact with the water flow, to give a low friction surface. Independent claim are also included for: (1) a tube manufactured with the cited method; and (2) a mantle for cable or optical fibers cable manufactured with the method.

Method of manufacturing a tubular member (12, 16) made of synthetic material, of
a kind wherein the tubular member (12, 16) is extruded, 
characterised in that
,
during extrusion of the tubular member (12, 16), the extruded synthetic material is

subjected to a flow of water in liquid or steam form in contact with the internal (12I)
or external (16E) surface of the tubular member (12, 16) in such a manner that

crevices (C) are formed in the surface (12I, 16E) of the tubular member (12, 16) in
contact with the flow of water, the surface (12I, 16E) having the crevices (C) being

designated a reduced-friction surface.
Method of manufacturing a tubular member (12, 16) according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the extruded synthetic material is subjected to a flow of water
in liquid form.
Method of manufacturing a tubular member (12, 16) according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the flow of water is made to contact the internal surface (12I)
of the tubular member (12).
Method of manufacturing a tubular member (12) according to claim 3,

characterised in that
 the tubular member (12) is extruded in an extruder head (10)
comprising a duct (14) intended for injecting the flow of water close to the internal

surface (12I) of the tubular member (12).
Method of manufacturing a tubular member (16) according to claim 4,

characterised in that
 the duct (14) intended for injecting the flow of water close to
the internal surface (12I) of the tubular member (12) is a duct intended for injecting

a lubricant in contact with the internal surface (12I) of the tubular member (12), the
water being injected into the lubricant duct (14) instead of the lubricant. 
Method of manufacturing a tubular member (16) according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the flow of water is made to contact the external
surface (16E) of the tubular member (16).
Method of manufacturing a tubular member (16) according to claim 6,

characterised in that
 the flow of water is injected into a nozzle (18) directed
towards the external surface (16E) of the tubular member (16).
Method of manufacturing a tubular member (12, 16) according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the synthetic material is a thermoplastic
material.
Method of manufacturing a tubular member (12, 16) according to claim 8,

characterised in that
 the synthetic material is polyethylene.
Tube (12) intended to form a housing for an elongate member such as a cable,
especially an optical fibre cable, 
characterised in that
 it is manufactured by a
method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, the internal surface (12I) of the

tube (12) being the reduced-friction surface.
Sheath (16) for a cable, especially an optical fibre cable, 
characterised in that
 it is
manufactured by a method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, the external

surface (16E) of the sheath (16) being the reduced-friction surface.
