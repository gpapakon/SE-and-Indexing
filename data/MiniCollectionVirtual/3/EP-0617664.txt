<ABSTRACT>
A laminate formed by heat fusing a heat sealable polyolefin sheet to two cured polyolefin sheets to produce a water impermeable seal between the cured polyolefin sheets. The heat sealable polyolefin sheet is preferably bonded to a porous heat resistant backing on one surface and the other surface is heat fused to the cured polyolefin sheets. The cured polyolefin sheets may typically be in juxtaposed or overlapping arrangement. The porous backing may be in the form of a fibrous sheet. The heat sealable polyolefin sheet is preferably low density polyethylene and the cured polyolefin sheets are typically cured EPDM rubber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
bonding cured polyolefins to uncured polyolefins. In 
particular, the present invention relates to forming a 
laminate by heat fusing a sheet of cured polyolefin and 
a heat sealable polyolefin to produce a substantially 
water impermeable seal. Rubbery olefinic polymer sheet material has 
widespread use in industries where it is desirable to 
provide a moisture proof membrane. For example, such 
membranes are used to line water reservoirs, waste 
treatment tanks, sewage lagoons, irrigation canals and 
industrial waste pits. Another important application 
is in the installation of flat roofs for commercial and 
industrial buildings. The most common material used as a roofing 
membrane is a cured polyolefin polymer referred to in 
the industry as EPDM rubber. EPDM rubbers are 
formulated from polymers of ethylene, propylene and 
diene monomers. EPDM is commonly compounded with 
various fillers, colorants, antioxidants, extenders, or 
cross linking agents. Other membrane materials are 
available and are formed from butyl rubber, polymers of 
ethylene and propylene monomers referred to as EP 
rubber, and combinations of the above. Such rubber 
membranes may be vulcanized by exposure to temperatures 
of about 160째C for about two hours. Other membranes 
are also available which are formed from PVC plastic, 
for example. EPDM rubber roofing membrane is available in 
sheets formed into 2 to 6 m widths and a variety of  
 
lengths. The sheets are typically extruded to a 
thickness of 1.50 mm and then vulcanized according to 
known means. The vulcanized sheets are stored and 
shipped in roll form. For many applications where rubbery membranes 
are used, it is necessary to connect a number of sheets 
together to form a substantially continuous water 
impermeable membrane over the surface to be protected. 
Forming a substantially water impermeable seam between 
such membranes has proven difficult. In the case of roofs, extremely rigorous 
demands are placed on the membrane, particularly in the 
areas where the sheets are spliced together. Roof 
temperatures may reach the boiling point of water when 
exposed to the summer sun, or may sink to -30째C or 
below in the winter. In most applications, the ability of the bond 
to protect the underlying surface is critical. For 
instance, with roof membranes, it is critical to form a 
substantially water impermeable joint which is capable 
of withstanding freeze and thaw cycles, and will remain 
intact for the entire life of the

<CLAIMS>
A laminate comprising two cured 
polyolefin sheets and a heat sealable polyolefin sheet 

wherein the cured polyolefin sheets have a seam 
therebetween and the heat sealable polyolefin sheet 

covers said seam and is fused to each of said cured 
polyolefin sheets, said heat sealable polyolefin sheet 

having a first major surface and opposite second major 
surface, said first major surface bonded to a porous 

backing and the second major surface being fused to 
said cured polyolefin sheets. 
The laminate of Claim 1 wherein the 
porous backing comprises fibrous material selected from 

the group consisting of fiberglass, polyester, 
cellulose, cotton and nylon fiber. 
The laminate of Claim 1 wherein the 
cured polyolefin sheets are roofing membranes 

comprising rubber formed of monomers selected from the 
group consisting of ethylene, propylene and diene. 
The laminate of Claim 1 wherein the heat 
sealable polyolefin is selected from the group 

consisting of low density polyethylene, linear low 
density polyethylene, ethylene vinyl acetate, 

polypropylene and a blend of low density polyethylene 
and polypropylene. 
The laminate of Claim 1 wherein the 
backing has a void volume of at least about 1% of the 

total backing volume and wherein a portion of the heat 
sealable polyolefin penetrates the backing. 
The method of forming the laminate of 
Claim 1 comprising the steps of:  

 

1) heating the cured polyolefin to a 
temperature between 160째C and 

232째C, 
2) heating the heat sealable polyolefin as 
necessary so that it becomes molten, and 
3) applying the molten heat sealable 
polyolefin to the cured polyolefin using 

a contact pressure of from 7 to 138 
KPa to fuse the heat sealable polyolefin 

to the cured polyolefin. 
A flexible laminate comprising a heat 
sealable polyolefin layer bonded to a porous backing 

wherein said porous backing:

the melting temperature of the heat 

sealable polyolefin layer, 
2) comprises fibrous material selected from 
the group consisting of fiberglass, 

polyester, cellulose, cotton and nylon 
fiber, and 
3) has a porosity of at least 1% by volume.
