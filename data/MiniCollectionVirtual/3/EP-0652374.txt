<ABSTRACT>
A system for controlling the operation of a turbo 
type fluid machine (1) driven by a variable speed prime mover (3), 

which enables the characteristics of the fluid machine (1) 
to be improved so as to become favorable for actual use 

while allowing the prime mover (3) to exhibit its capacity to 
the full even at an operating point other 
than the rated 
point. The operation control system includes a turbo type 

fluid machine (1) driven by a driving machine (3), and a device 
for detecting an operating head or operating pressure of 

the fluid machine. The operation control system further 
includes a device (5) for arithmetically outputting a 

rotational speed which gives a preset characteristic 
of the fluid machine in corresponding relation to the 

operating head or operating pressure, and a device (4) for 
changing the rotational speed of the driving machine in 

response to the output rotational speed, so that even 
when the operating head or operating pressure of the 

fluid machine (1) changes, the rotational speed of the 
fluid machine is controlled so as to maintain the preset 

characteristic of the fluid machine (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
controlling the operation of a turbo type fluid machine.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a
turbo type fluid machine operation control system which
enables a turbo machine, e.g., a pump, a blower, etc.,
to exhibit favorable performance characteristics in
conformity to each particular purpose of use.To control the output of a turbo type fluid
machine, e.g., a pump, a blower, etc., a technique whereby
the rotational speed of a driving machine for the turbo
machine is varied has been widely employed. According
to a conventional method of controlling the output of
a turbo machine by the rotational speed control, the
rotational speed is varied so that the head or pressure
produced by the turbo machine or the capacity (i.e.,
discharge quantity) thereof complies with the demand
therefor, thereby controlling the characteristics of
the fluid machine. That is, in automatic control, the
rotational speed is feedback-controlled on the basis
of the result of a comparison between the value of the
detected quantity, e.g., the discharge pressure, capacity,
etc., on the demand side and the corresponding set value.For example, to change the characteristics of
a turbo type fluid machine that is driven by an internal
combustion engine or other driving machine, such a method
has been put to practical use that the fuel feed is
controlled by a speed governor to thereby control the
rotational speed of the driving machine. To set a
rotational speed, a signal is manually or automatically
given to the speed governor according to the required
discharge pressure or capacity of the fluid machine.
However, no method has been known whereby a pump and/or
a driving machine therefor is allowed to exhibit its 
capacity to the full in accordance with the operating
conditions, as is demanded for a drainage pump or the
like, except for constant-speed shaft power control that
is carried out by employing adjustable vanes in corporated
in the pump. It should be noted that when adjustable
vanes are employed, a complicated mechanism is needed
to adjust the angle of the vanes. Therefore, the
constant-speed shaft power control is disadvantageous
in general-purpose applications.For a pump that is driven by an induction motor,
a method has heretofore been put to practical use wherein,
in order to change pump characteristics in accordance
with the operating conditions and load conditions, the
frequency of the power supply for the motor is changed
by the use of a static invertor, thereby
