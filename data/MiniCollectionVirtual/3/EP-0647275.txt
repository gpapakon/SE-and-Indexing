<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the GnRH-R genes and proteins. The DNA sequences disclosed herein may be engineered into expression systems designed for the production of GnRH-R and/or cell lines which express the GnRH-R and preferably respond to GnRH induced signal transduction. Such cell lines may advantageously be used for screening and identifying GnRH agonists and antagonists. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the GnRH DNA, antisense oligonucleotide sequences, the GnRH expression products, and antibodies to such products may be used in the diagnosis and therapy of reproductive disorders associated with abnormal expression of the GnRH-R; e.g., overexpression, underexpression or expression or expression of a dysfunctional mutant receptor. Transgenic animals containing the GnRHR transgene may be used as animal models for the evaluation of GnRH analogs (in vivo).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the cloning of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R), and
genetically engineered host cells which express the
GnRH-R. Such engineered cells may be used to evaluate
and screen drugs and analogs of GnRH involved in GnRH-R
activation, regulation and uncoupling.The GnRH-R is a key mediator in the integration
of the neural and endocrine systems. Normal
reproduction depends on the pulsatile release of
physiological concentrations of GnRH which binds to
specific high affinity pituitary receptors and
triggers the secretion of the gonadotropins
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating
hormone (FSH). Whereas physiological concentrations
of GnRH orchestrate normal reproduction, high levels
of agonist lead to an opposite response, the
suppression of gonadotropin secretion. The capacity
of GnRH analogues both to activate and to inhibit the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis has led to their
wide clinical utility in the treatment of a variety of
disorders ranging from infertility to prostatic
carcinoma.The responsiveness and capacity of the
gonadotrope GnRH-R is influenced by agonist,
concentration and pattern of exposure (Clayton, 1989,
J Endocrinol 120: 11-19). Both invivo and invitro
studies have demonstrated that low concentration
pulsatile GnRH is trophic to the receptor and that a
high concentration of agonist induces receptor down-regulation
and desensitization. The binding of GnRH 
to its receptor stimulates phospholipase C and
generates inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and
diacylglycerol (Huckle & Conn, 1988, Endocrine Reviews
9: 387-395). These second messengers, in turn,
release calcium from intracellular stores and activate
protein kinase C. Receptor up-regulation appears to
involve both protein kinase C and calcium (Huckle &
Conn, 1988, Endocrine Reviews 9: 387-395; Huckle
et al., 1988, Journal of Biological Chemistry 263:
3296-3302; Young et al., 1985, Journal of
Endocrinology 107: 49-56). It is not certain which
effectors underlie down-regulation.Sealfon S., C. et al., Molecular endocrinology,
Vol. 4, No. 1, pp. 119-124, 1990, discloses the
characterization of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone
receptor in Xenopus oocytes injected with RNA isolated

αT3 cells prior to the injection in Xenopus oocytes,
