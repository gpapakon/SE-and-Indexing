Lamp for fluorescent tubes with a housing (2) of plastic consisting of two 
half-shells (9, 10) that can be divided laterally, a plug element (3) molded 

out of the housing (2), an illumination field with possibly an illumination 
field cover (5), as well as the electrical equipment necessary for operating 

the fluorescent tube (12), characterized by a switching element (7) guided 
through both half-shells (9, 10) of the housing (2) which can be held in place 

in the desired switching position by catch element (19) provided on the 
housing. 
Lamp according to claim 1, characterized in that a catch element (19) is 
molded out of at least one of the two half-shells (9, 10). 
Lamp accoding to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the catch element (19) 
is constructed as a slotted spring cage projecting into the housing (2). 
Lamp according to claim 3, characterized in that the switching element is 
constructed as a pushbutton (7) with two concentric and parallel catch 

planes (23, 24) which cooperate with engagement elements (21) provided on 
the spring cage (19) and which project into the spring cage (19), defining in 

this way the switching positions. 
Lamp according to claim 4, characterized in that the pushbotton (7) has a 
circumferential flange (26) adjacent to the inner catch plane (24).  

 
Lamp according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the part of the 
pushbotton (7) lying between the two catch planes (23, 24) is constructed as 

a bead (25) the sides of which run down towards the catch planes (23, 24). 
Lamp according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the part of the 
pushbotton (7) lying between the two catch planes (23, 24) is constructed a 

a double cone (25) which tapers the catch planes (23, 24). 
Lamp according to claim 7, characterized in that the double cone (25) is 
constructed asymmetrically such that a short and a long slope towards the 

two catch planes (23, 24) result. 
Lamp according to one of claims 4-8, characterized in that the pushbotton 
(7) has an actuator (29) for a contact member (28) in the form of a contact 

jaw. 
Lamp according to one of claims 4-8, characterized in that the pushbotton 
(7) has an actuator (29) for a contact member (28) in the form of a recess. 
Lamp according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the contact member 
(28) connects a circuit board (30) to the contacts (27) of a fluorescent tube 

(12) or to a plug connector contact (4). 
Lamp according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that the 
switching element (7) is arranged in a recess (6) of the housing (2). 
Lamp according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that the 
housing consists of two half-shells (9, 10) that are connected so as to be 

folded together.  
 
Lamp according to claim 13, characterized in that the housing is divided in 
the axial direction and the plug element (3) is molded at least in part from 

the half-shells (9, 10) on a long side. 
Lamp according to claim 13 or 14, characterized in that the two half-shells 
(9, 10) are connected by means of plastic film hinges (13). 
Lamp according to one of claims 13-15, characterized in that the half-shells 
(9, 10) are connected by way of the bottom (11) of the plug element (3). 
Lamp according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that the 
housing (2) has at least one slot-shaped cutout (8) in the area of the 

separating line of the two half-shells (9, 10) for inserting the contact pins 
(27) of the fluroescent tube (12). 
Lamp according to claim 17, characterized in that the housing (2) has the 
slot-shaped cutout (8) on one side adjacent to the illumination field in the 

area of the separating line of the half-shells (9, 10) and, on the other side, 
an insertion opening for the contact pins (27) of the fluorescent tube (12). 
Lamp according to claim 17 or 18, characterized in that the housing (2) has 
flexible ridges (31) for holding the flurorescent tube (12) in place in its 

operating position and also for blocking off the slot-shaped cutout (8) on the 
insertion side. 
Lamp according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that it has 
contact members (28) with a V-shaped profile which cooperate with the 

contact pins (27) of the fluorescent tube (12) and bring about a securing of 
the fluorescent tube (12) in its operating position.  

 
Lamp according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized by a 
translucent and form-fit illumination field cover (5). 
Lamp according to claim 21, characterized in that, in the area directly 
adjacent to the illumination field cover (5), the housing (2) has at least one 

recess (6) that facilitates the prying loose of the illumination field cover (5). 
Lamp according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in the half-shells 
(9, 10) are held together by pressing or welding. 
Lamp according to one of the claims 1-22, characterized in that the half-shells 
are connected to each other by catch elements (14, 15).
