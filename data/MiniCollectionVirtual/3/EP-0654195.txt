<ABSTRACT>
A hub (10) for a segmented virtual local area network with shared media access has at least one internal port (12) for receiving and transmitting digital data messages within the hub and may have at least one external port (18) for receiving and transmitting digital data messages external to the hub. The hub further includes a memory (42) for storing virtual local area network (VLAN) designations for internal and external ports, means (60) for associating VLAN designations with at least one internal port and storing such VLAN designations in the memory, and means (64) for associating the stored VLAN designations with messages transmitted from any of the ports to which the VLAN designation has been assigned. Additionally, the hub includes both means (66) for identifying VLAN designations associated with messages received by or within the hub and means (68) for transmitting to any of the internal ports only messages received within the hub and having associated with them a VLAN designation which matches the stored VLAN designation assigned to the port. The hub may also have the ability to store media access control (MAC) addresses associated with ports and only send a message to a port when the destination address of the message is known to be reachable through that port.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to local area
networks for digital data communication and, more
particularly, to network hubs for local area networks
with enhanced privacy and optimized use of network
bandwidth.A local area network (LAN) for digital data
communications typically includes a plurality of network
hubs interconnected by a suitable backbone transmission
network. Individual hubs in a LAN may include one or
more internal ports to which end stations may be
connected and one or more external ports for transmitting
messages from the hub to the backbone transmission
network and for receiving messages for the hub from the
backbone transmission network. In such a LAN, messages
originating at an internal port of one hub, or at an end
station connected to an internal port of such a hub, are
commonly transmitted to every other hub and end station
in the LAN, although typically they are addressed to only
a single end station within the LAN. Message security
depends upon limiting access by individual hubs and end
stations to only those messages specifically addressed to
them. Because all messages share the same transmission
media (including the backbone network), both the number
and the size of the messages carried by the LAN at any
one time are limited by the available transmission
bandwidth. If enhanced security and more efficient use
of the available bandwidth are desired, it is generally
necessary to rewire the LAN physically so that it
includes only the smaller sub-set of hubs or end stations
needed.In the past, separately wired LANs have often been
interconnected by so-called bridging or routing functions
allowing the transfer of messages from a port or end
station of a hub in one LAN to a port or end station of a 
hub in another LAN. Bridges, as a minimum, examine the
addresses contained by a message to accomplish the
desired transfers, whereas routers provide more
functionality, commonly supplying such capabilities as
protocol conversions and store and forward operation.
Bridging and routing functions not only tend to be
complex to implement but also can potentially detract
from both message security and most efficient use of
transmission bandwidth.A previous approach to enhancing message security
and improving bandwidth efficiency in the context of
interconnected data terminals avoided the shared
transmission media of a hard wired LAN entirely and
depended, instead, upon use of a switched
telecommunications network as the sole interconnection
medium. Such an approach is illustrated in U. S.

<CLAIMS>
A digital data communications network hub (10)
for controlling the transmission of messages to internal

and external ports and to any end stations connected to
the internal and external ports, where only the external

ports are connectible to hubs other than the hub,
characterized by the combination of:


n internal ports (12, 14, 16) for receiving and
transmitting messages within the hub, where n is an

integer greater than zero;
m external ports (18) for receiving and
transmitting messages external to the hub, where m is an

integer greater than zero;
memory means (42) for storing virtual local
area network (VLAN) designations for at least some of the

internal ports and for storing media access control (MAC)
addresses of the internal ports;
means (60) for assigning a VLAN designation to
at least one of the internal ports and storing the

assigned VLAN designation in the memory means;
means (64) for associating the stored VLAN
designation with messages transmitted from any of the

internal ports to which the stored VLAN designation has
been assigned;
means (66) for identifying VLAN designations
associated with messages received by any of the ports;

and
means (68) for transmitting to any of the
internal ports only messages received within the hub

which have an associated VLAN designation which matches
the stored VLAN designation assigned to those particular

ports.
The network hub of claim 1 further
characterized by the combination of:


means (60) for storing in the memory means VLAN
designations for at least some of the external ports; and
means (70) for transmitting outside of the hub
from any of the external ports only messages having 

associated with them VLAN designations which match a VLAN
designation stored in the memory means and associated

with such external ports.
The network hub of claim 1 further
characterized by:


means (62) for determining the MAC address of
each end station connected to any of the internal ports

and storing the MAC addresses thus obtained in the memory
means; and in which:
the memory means also stores MAC addresses for
end stations including end stations connected to any of

the internal ports;
the means for identifying VLAN designations
also identifies destination addresses carried by messages

received within the hub;
and the means for transmitting transmits to any
of the internal ports only received messages which have

an associated VLAN designation which matches the stored
VLAN designation assigned to that particular port and

carry a destination address which matches the stored MAC
address of one of the end stations connected to the same

port.
The network hub of claim 3 in which at least
one of the internal ports is assigned at least a first

VLAN designation for messages addressed to end stations
to which it is connected and at least a second VLAN

designation for messages addressed to it rather than to
end stations to which it is connected.
The network hub of claim 3 further
characterized by:


means (70) for transmitting outside the hub
from the external ports messages which have associated

with them the assigned VLAN designation and which
originate from any of the internal ports only when such

transmitted messages are addressed to neither an internal
port within the hub nor an end station connected to an

internal port within the hub.
The network hub of claim 3 further
characterized by the combination of:


means (60) for storing in the memory means VLAN
designations for at least some of the external ports; and
means (70) for transmitting outside of the hub
from any of the external ports only messages having

associated with them VLAN designations which match a VLAN
designation stored in the memory means and associated

with such external ports.
The network hub of claim 3 further
characterized by the combination of:


means (62) for storing in the memory means MAC
addresses for at least some of any end stations connected

to the hub only through the external ports and VLAN
designations for at least some of the exter
nal ports; and
means (70) for transmitting outside the hub
from any of the external ports messages originating from

any of the internal ports only to an end station whose
MAC address is stored in the memory means or, if the

addressed end station's MAC address is not stored in the
memory means, then only through an external port having a

VLAN designation matching the VLAN designation of the
internal port at which the messages originate.
