<ABSTRACT>
Three-dimensionally shaped synthetic foam surfaces are 
made by pressing an originally plane surface (26) of a foam slab (20) 

against a die (12) having raised die portions (28) corresponding to 
desired raised portions (42) on the shaped surface separated by 

die depressions (30) corresponding to desired depressions (48) on the 
shaped surface, with sufficient force to extrude portions of 

the slab (20) into the die depressions (30), and cutting away the 
portions while so extruded. The method may be practiced as a 

continuous rotary process by compressing foam between a die 
roller (12) and a pressure roller (14) and slicing away the extruded 

portions along a plane tangent to the die roller (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention in the first place relates to a method
for making an article of synthetic foam having a three-dimensionally
shaped surface with raised portions separated by depressions,
comprising the steps of:
providing a slab of synthetic foam having a planar surface;providing a rotary die having a continuous rotary die surface
with raised die portions defining an imaginary outer cylindrical
surface and corresponding to desired raised portions on the shaped
surface and die depressions corresponding to desired depressions
on the shaped surface;pressing said planar surface by means of a pressure roller
against said die with sufficient force to extrude portions of said
slab into said die depressions and thereby to urge said slab of
synthetic foam against a cutting edge.  Such a method is known from DE-A-20 50 845. In the method
according to this German Offenlegungsschrift the slab of synthetic
foam material is pressed against the surface of the rotary die
while a conveyor belt is present between the foam slab and the
die surface. Further an additional friction reducing layer of
flexible material may be present between the die surface and the
conveyor belt to minimize friction.Synthetic foam has been widely used to make mattress overlay
pads and similar articles intended to cushion the body of a person
resting on a supporting surface. In general, such pads seek to
provide controlled support by conforming to the natural contours
of the user's anatomy so as to avoid areas of concentrated pressure.
These areas diminish the user's comfort, and if allowed to persist,
the diminished blood flow through the affected tissues frequently
leads to painful and slow healing skin ulcerations, which are
particularly common among the bed ridden and persons confined to
a wheel chair.Considerable effort has been expended to improve the 
distribution of pressure over the user's anatomy and provide air
flow under the person's body to avoid excessive concentration of
heat and humidity which is detrimental to comfort and well being.The object of the present invention is to provide a method
for making an article of synthetic foam having a three-dimensionally
shaped surface with raised portions separated by depressions closely
conforming to the geometry of the die surface.To this end the present invention provides a method for making
an article of synthetic foam having a three-dimensionally shaped
surface with raised portions separated by depressions, comprising
the steps of:

A method for making an article of synthetic foam having
a three-dimensionally shaped surface with raised portions separated

by depressions, comprising the steps of:

providing a slab (20) of synthetic foam having a planar surface

cylindrical surface and corresponding to desired raised portions
(40) on the shaped surface (38) and die depressions (30)

corresponding to desired depressions (50) on the shaped surface;
pressing said planar surface (17) by means of a pressure roller

(25) of said slab (20) into said die depressions and thereby to
urge said slab of synthetic foam against a cutting edge,
characterized in that
,
that the planar surface (17) is pressed against the die (12)
to extrude portions (25) of said slab (20) into said die depressions,

in direct contact with said die surface (24); and
that said cutting edge is positioned in tangential relationship
with said imaginary outer cylindrical surface just beyond a point

of minimum spacing between said imaginary outer cylindrical surface
and said pressure roller for cutting away substantially only said

portions (25) extruded into said die depressions (30) from said
slab (20) to make a shaped foam surface which closely conforms

to the geometry of the die surface.

characterized in that
, said
raised portions (28) of said die have planar top surfaces (26)

with radiused edges (52, 44') for producing raised portions (40)
with planar top surfaces (42) and radiused edges (44'') on said

shaped surface (38).
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
,
said raised portions (28) of said die surface (24) have side surfaces

(23) extending from a common bottom surface (48) and a concavely
curved transition (56) between said side surfaces (23) and said 

bottom surface (48) and the shaped foam surface has radiused lower
edges (58) between side surfaces (46'') and a bottom surface (48'').
Apparatus for three-dimensionally shaping a surface of
a synthetic foam slab (20), comprising:


a rotary die (12) having a continuous surface (24) with raised
die portions (28) including a top surface of said raised die portions

(28) defining an imaginary outer cylindrical surface, said raised
die portions (28) corresponding to desired raised portions (40)

on the surface (38) to be shaped, and die depressions (30)
corresponding to desired depressions (50) on the surface (38) to

be shaped;
a pressure roller (14) parallel to said die surface (24) and
spaced therefrom for admitting said slab (20) therebetween so as

to press the surface (17) of the slab (20) against said die surface
(24) with sufficient pressure to extrude portions (25) of said

foam slab (20) into said die depressions (30);

with said die surface (24); and

tangential relationship with said imaginary outer cylindrical surface

just beyond a point of minimum spacing between said die surface
and said pressure roller so as to spare from cutting away portions

of said slab (20) compressed against said top surface (26).
