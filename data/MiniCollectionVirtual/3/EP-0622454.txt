<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a granular laundry detergent component 
or composition having a bulk density of at least 650 g/l, 

by dissolving a structuring agent in a nonionic surfactant, 
said structuring agent comprising a polymer, to form a 

pumpable premix and finely dispersing said premix with an 
effective amount of powder at a given operating temperature 

wherein the premix has a viscosity of at least 350 mPas 
when measured at said operating temperature and at a shear 

rate of 25s⁻¹. Preferred structurants comprise polymers 
having more than one functional hydroxyl group, especially 

polyvinyl alcohols, polyhydroxyacrylic acid polymers, and 
polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone and PVNO, as well as 

sugars, artificial sweeteners and their derivatives. 
The premix is then processed into a granular detergent by 

any suitable process. Fine dispersion mixing, 
agglomeration, or spraying the premix onto a granular base 

product are preferred. 
Another aspect of the present invention is components or 
compositions comprising nonionic surfactant and structuring 

agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improving storage 
stability and physical properties of granular detergents 
which are rich in nonionic surfactant. It is most useful with nonionic surfactants which are 
liquid at ambient temperature, and are therefore mobile. 
Without a suitable structurant, the nonionic surfactant 
tends to leak from the powder and soak into the cardboard 
container which forms an unsightly stain. Although it is 
possible to avoid this problem by using lower levels of  
 
nonionic surfactant in the composition, or by selecting 
nonionic surfactants which have a higher solidification 
temperature, this limits the flexibility of formulation. The use of nonionic surfactants in granular detergent 
applications has been widely discussed in the prior art. 
The following references describe various processes and 
compositions for making granules which comprise nonionic 
surfactants. US 3 868 336, published 25th February, 1975 discloses the 
use of a powder premix comprising perborate, 
tripolyphosphate, nonionic surfactant and polyvinyl 
alcohol. The premix is dry added to other detergent 
components. GB 2 137 221, published 3rd October, 1984 discloses a 
nonionic premix which comprises dissolved polyvinyl 
pyrrolidone (PVP) and soil release polymer. The premix is 
sprayed on to an absorbant detergent carrier particle. The 
PVP is used as a stabiliser for the soil release polymer. EPA 0 215 637, published on 25th March, 1987 discloses the 
use of sugars and derivatives as structurants of spray 
dried detergent powders. Although nonionic surfactant may 
be present in such powders it is incorporated at relatively 
low levels (1.5% - 4% in examples 1 to 5). Furthermore the 
spray dried powder has a low bulk density (324 - 574 g/l). EPA 0 513 824, published 19th November, 1992, describes a 
process for granulating nonionic detergent and the use of 
a surface coating agent having a particle size of less than 
10 micrometers to give a powder having a high content of 
nonionic surfactant (10-60%) and a bulk density of 0.6 to 
1.2 g/ml. The use of polymers including polyethylene 
glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and 
carboxymethyl cellulose is disclosed (page 13, lines 17-18).  
 
However, the benefits of using any of these polymers 
to structure or thicken the nonionic surfactant is not 
disclosed. WO 92 6160, published on 16th April, 1992. This application 
describes (example 14) a granular detergent composition 
prepared by fine dispersion mixing in an Eirich RV02 mixer 
of a
