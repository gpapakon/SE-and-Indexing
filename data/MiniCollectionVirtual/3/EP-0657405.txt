<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a device for producing solid fertiliser from liquid wastes, in particular from liquid manure from animal keeping, the liquid manure being intimately mixed in situ with crop remains during the grinding of the wastes. The particle size in the ground material is a few micrometres. The particles of the ground wastes adsorb and absorb the liquid manure completely, so that a product results which neither has an annoying smell, nor pollutes the groundwater. The product contains all the substances from the liquid manure and the wastes and is thus a high-quality fertiliser which can be added to the soil to be fertilised using the methods and equipment customary in agriculture. Fig. 1 illustrates the principle of the simultaneous introduction of liquid manure via a supply line 5 and of the crop remains via a conveyor arrangement 10 and a metering device 11 into a grinding and mixing machine 7.
