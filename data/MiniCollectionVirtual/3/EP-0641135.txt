<ABSTRACT>
A small telephone system provides telecommunications 
services for personal wireless telephone sets over an area which is 

divided into service cells. Each of the cells is defined by reception 
characteristics of a plurality of radio base stations within the cell. During a 

call progress, if the wireless telephone set is mobile, a radio link with the 
set is handed off from one cell to another as the wireless telephone set 

moves along. The telephone system includes a service controller and a 
port being wireline connected between each radio base station and the 

service controller. The service controller selects radio base stations for 
setting up radio links with wireless sets of a calling or called persons, and 

responds to received signal strengths for handing a radio link from radio 
base station to radio base station, to maintain the quality of the radio link 

with an active mobile wireless telephone set.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to low power wireless communication 
systems, but more particularly to a telephone system for providing low 
power mobile telephone service. Wireless telephones, such as cellular phones, have become 
popular beyond expectation. Cellular phones are supported by cellular 
telephone systems which typically include a mobile telephone central 
switching exchange being connected to a multitude of geographically 
distributed cellular radio stations via a corresponding multitude of multi-channel 
trunks. In populous areas, cellular systems are rapidly becoming 
overloaded with the result that mobile telephone services are sometimes 
degraded or simply unavailable. As an alternative to the cellular systems, 
a new standard referred to as CT2 has been recommended. This standard 
defines low power radio links, in a different portion of the radio frequency 
spectrum with respect to that of the cellular spectrum, and being functional 
over much shorter distances, for example distances of up to about 200 
metres. It has been realized that the typical cellular system structure and 
radio link control methods are inefficient and unsuitable for direct 
application in a telephone switch incorporating the CT2 standard. It is an object of the invention to provide a low power wireless 
telephony service, being supported by a small telephone system. Small telephone systems are of two different basic architectures, 
namely that of a key telephone system, and that of a telephone branch 
exchange. In these systems, individual associated telephone sets have 
traditionally been wire linked to the system.  The branch exchange includes a call controller which is 
commonly accessible to all the telephones connected to the branch 
exchange. Telephone operations and telephony features are centrally 
provided. Beyond some minimum size, the branch exchange is more 
economical than the key telephone system. A wireless system supported 
by a branch exchange is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,771,448. Key telephone systems are characterised in that there is little or 
no apparatus which is commonly accessible to the telephones connected to 
the system. The primary advantage of key telephone systems is one of 
economy with small size. Examples of small telephone systems, are disclosed in each of 
United States Patent Nos. 4,873,682, 4,893,310 and 5,136,585 issued in the 
names of George Irwin et al, David Robertson et al, and Nadir 
Nizamuddin et al respectively, each being titled "Digital Key Telephone 
System

<CLAIMS>
In a small telephone system having a plurality of cells for 
wireless communication with portable sets each having a preassigned 

identity, wherein each cell includes a plurality of radio base stations, any 
one of which is operable to provide a radio link with a portable set over 

any one of a plurality of radio frequency channels, a method of 
establishing a call between a radio base station and a portable set, 

wherein an originating radio link is established with the portable set of a 
called party, from a radio base station, comprising the steps of: 


a) receiving an incoming call request for a called party 
associated with a portable set; 
b) estimating the location of the portable set from amongst said 
plurality of cells; 
c) selecting radio base stations having vacant radio frequency 
channels in cells located near a probable location of the portable set; 
d) broadcasting a radio signal including a coded message 
corresponding to the preassigned identity of a called portable set in at 

least one vacant channel of each selected radio base station; 
e) after each radio signal broadcast, monitoring the at least one 
radio frequency channel for a portable set response broadcast including 

the identity of the called portable set; 
f) receiving the portable set response broadcast at a first radio 
base station if the portable set response broadcast is of a receive signal 

strength indication (RSSI) level greater than a switch originating link setup 
(SOLS) threshold level, and broadcasting a radio signal indicative of the 

channel and the RSSI level of the radio link with the called portable set to 
a first cell manager associated with said first radio base station; and 
g) establishing a radio link between the first base station and 
the portable set on said indicated channel. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein a telephone 
wireless connection between the radio base station and the portable set is 

completed if, the RSSI level of the radio link therebetween is at least a 
value of an arbitration threshold. 
A method as defined in claim 2, comprising the further steps 
of:

 
   in response to the RSSI level being of a lesser value than 

the arbitration threshold, instructing cell managers associated with base 
stations in neighboring cells to send registered RSSI levels, if greater than 

said SOLS threshold level, associated with said portable set to said first 
cell manager; 

   receiving the registered RSSI levels of cell managers 
associated with neighboring cells and comparing with the RSSI level of the 

radio link; and 
   enabling completion of a radio link at the cell manager 

having the highest RSSI level. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein the location of said 
portable set is estimated, by: 

   identifying and searching a first half of said plurality of cells; 
   identifying and searching a second half of said plurality of 

cells if the portable set was not found in the first half; and 
   searching all cells of said plurality of cells if the searches of 

the first and second half failed to locate the portable set. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein the location of said 
portable set is estimated, by: 

   randomly polling, at regular intervals, all portable sets; 
   maintaining a positional histogram for each registered 

portable set, relative each cell in said plurality of cells. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein the location of said 
portable set is estimated, by: 

   forwarding a list of free frequency radio channels to each 
base station associated with separate groups of cells; and 

   instructing a radio base station in a cell to select a frequency 
radio channel on said list for searching for the portable set, wherein each 

cell which uses a radio base station for searching is separated by at least 
one cell from any other cell which also uses a radio base station for 

searching the portable set.
