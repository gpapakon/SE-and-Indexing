<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD AND MEANS FOR TRANSMULÎ—PLEXINGSIGNALS BETWEEN SIGNAL TERMINALS AND RADIOFREQUENCY CHANNELSField of the InventionThe invention relates to communication systems, and in specific to multichannel transmultiplexing within communication systems.Background of the InventionDigital signal processing, and the digital signal processors (DSPs) within which such processing occurs, are known. DSPs are typically used whenever significant numbers of sample parameters must be collected and/or communicated. DSPs in such an environment are used to control sampling and encoding of a signal for storage or transmission to a destination. Although the most familiar uses of such systems lie in the area of voice processing for communications systems, significant applications for such techniques exist in other areas such as geologic surveying or other multi-dimensional data gathering activities. Use of DSPs in the context of signal gathering and transmission is often limited to a single input signal. Such single input format is convenient because of the complexity of the multi-input data encoding within the transmission channel and also because of the computational complexity of multichannel signal processing within a DSP.Within the context of a single transmission channel a DSP provides considerable flexibility in adapting to the constraints of the channel. Data samples gathered at a first sampling rate may be reconstructed within the DSP at a second sampling rate without loss of information under the well-known sampling theorem (see pgs. 20-- 21 of Multirate Digital Signal Processing by Crochiere and Rabiner, Prentice-Hall Inc., 1983). Where the sampling rate is increased, the values of the increased sampling rate are generated through a 

process generally referred to as interpolation. As the sampling rate, n, increases (n approaches infinity) a continuous signal (analogous to the originally sampled signal) is generated. Where the sampling rate is decreased, the process is referred to as decimation. The only limit on decimation is that the sampling rate may not be decreased below twice the highest frequency present in the sampled signal, all in accordance with the familiar Nyquist theorem.In addition to decimation and interpolation, a bandwidth of a sampled signal may be translated in frequency from a first frequency to a second frequency. As an example, a sampled signal may be frequency translated from a zero-radio frequency (zero-rf) baseband to an appropriate spectrum for transmission through a medium to a

STATEMENTUNDER ARTICLE 19
This statement is being filed in reply to a communication dated 4 February 1994.
In the search report, claims 7-10 were indicated as lacking novelty because of Morton (US-A-4, 881, 191) . The Morton reference describes a decimating filter, but differs from the invention presently claim in two aspects. The present invention teaches a transmultiplexing by comb filtering and decimating a plurality of signals. In addition, the Morton reference addresses the use of rate change filters operating on time multiplexed channels whereas the present claims filters multiple channels which are multiplexed in frequency. These elements are not shown or taught by the Morton reference. Therefore, Applicants contend that claims 7-10 are novel over the Morton reference .
The search report also indicated that claim 1-6 lack an inventive step in view of Ichiyoshi (US-A-4,785, 47) and the Bellanger IEEE article. Neither of the references consider the use of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter banks with comb filters . The use of an interpolating/decimating comb filter reÂ¬ orders the location of the channels in the frequency domain which impacts the design of the DFT filter bank. The comb filters taught by the applicant extends the capabilities of a DFT filter bank in a manner not described in the references . This comb filter allows the DFT filter bank to analyze or synthesize channels which are widely spaced. A decimating comb filter attenuates channels located at frequencies between the desired channels, compressing the spectrum, and allowing the DFT filter bank to operate at a lower sample rate. This lower sample rate enables the DFT filter bank to operate with lower computational effort than the original filter bank (without the comb filter) using a high sample rate input. Similarly, an interpolating comb filter enables the DFT filter bank to operate at a lower sample rate, expands the spectrum, and filters out images between the frequencies where the desired channels are located. This is believed to provide an inventive step over that which is shown in the references cited.
