<ABSTRACT>
In the preparation of a laminate sheet S comprising a 
substrate 1 of a ring structure-containing amorphous olefin 

polymer (AMCEC) and crystalline PP films 21 and 22 provided 
on both sides of the substrate, the surface of the 

substrate 1 is subjected to a surface treatment immediately 
before laminating the films 21 and 22 on the substrate 1, 

and the films 21 and 22 are laminated on the substrate 1 to 
form the sheet S. Then, the sheet S is provided with a 

shape C for encasing a content, and after the content is 
encased, the sheet and a liner layer made from a metal foil 

are fusion bonded to each other to obtain a PTP. According 
to the inventi
on, a material excellent in heat resistance, 
moldability and properties required for molded articles 

such as moisture resistance, transparency, rigidity, low-temperature 
resistance and slippability can be obtained. 

Further, the material is extended in the allowance of 
heating temperatures and heating time for the forming 

process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a material for
forming a compartmented package in which a content encased
therein can be protected and stored and from which the
content can be easily taken out if necessary without using
any special tool (i.e., so-called "PTP" or "Press-Through-Pack").
More particularly, the invention relates to a
compartmented package forming material which is so shaped
that the package can encase therein pellets or tablets,
capsules for powders such as seasoning powder and medical
powder, sweets such as candies and chocolates and paste-like
materials such as jam, marmalade, glue and grease,
which can protect and store the content for a long period
of time in the state where the content can be easily
observed from outside, and which perse can be formed into
a package easily and can provide strong properties to
endure various circumstances and transportations to the
package. The invention also relates to a process for
preparing the compartmented package forming material, an 
apparatus for preparing said material, a compartmented
package forming laminate comprising said material and a
liner layer, a process for preparing said laminate and an
apparatus for preparing said laminate.There has been commonly used such a compartmented
package forming laminate that a content encased therein can
be protected and stored and the content can be easily taken
out therefrom if necessary without using any special tool
(i.e., so-called "PTP" or "Press-Through-Pack"). As a PTP
forming material to be provided with a shape for encasing a
content, a polyvinyl chloride (abbreviated to "PVC") resin
has been widely used, and the PVC has been predominant in
various resins from the viewpoints of transparency and
moldability or formability (easy to flow after melting and
small shrinkage after molding). Accordingly, most of
molding machines or forming machines generally prevailed
are designed to process PVC.In the use of PVC, however, various environmental
problems which have been recently taken into serious
consideration should be solved. Particularly when PTP made
of PVC is incinerated, disposal of an exhaust gas is a
serious problem. On that account, polyolefin (abbreviated
to "PO"), particularly polypropylene (abbreviated to "PP"),
has been paid much attention. Since any polyolefin
contains no halogen such as chlorine, a problem regarding 
to the disposal of an exhaust gas caused by the
incineration hardly takes place.Among various polyolefins (PO), polypropylene (PP) is
most predominant in view of transparency
