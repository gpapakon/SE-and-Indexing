Process for the synchronization of the scanning circuit (BA) of an
image display device (MB) comprising an input buffer store (MT), processing

means (D) making it possible to reconstitute each image arriving in
the buffer store (MT), display storage means (MV) in which the images are

recorded after processing and control means (C) able to control the
writing or reading of images into said display storage means, said images

being acquired by a camera having a scanned circuit controlled by a given
acquisition clock, characterized in that the number of bits generated by

the image acquired by the camera is variable, said process being such that
there is a permanent emptying of the input buffer store, to the scanning

circuit of the image display device is applied an arbitrary clock signal
independent of the image synchronization of the signal received, the

reading and writing of the display storage means are controlled in order
to obtain image repetitions or blankings on display, so as to absorb any

frequency difference between the synchronization clock of the device and
another independent clock, use being made of a rapid image decompression

so as not to disturb all the writing-reading mechanisms.
Synchronization process according to claim 1, characterized in that it
consists of subdividing the display storage means into at least two

storage fields, controlling the processing of an image I as said image is
recorded in the input memory, controlling the recording of said image I

during its processing in one of the storage fields, and then either:

only authorizing the reading of the field in which said image has been
recorded if the processing of a new image has ended, otherwise controlling

a new reading of the content of the other field and only authorizing the
processing of a new image when the switching from one field to the other

has taken place; or, with the processing of an image ended:
continuing the reading of the other field containing an already recorded
image in such a way as to read said image once more 

than the others; or
controlling the reading of said first field so as to display
the recorded image which has been processed and display once

less than the others an image previously processed and recorded
in the other field.
Synchronization process according to claims 1 or 2, characterized
in that it consists in the case where the acquisition

clock is slower than the display clock, controlling the reading
of an image recorded in one of the fields so as to display

said image several times until the following image has been
processed and recorded in the other field.
Synchronizing process according to claims 1 or 2, characterized
in that it consists in the case where the acquisition

clock is faster than the display clock, choosing processing
means which are faster than necessary able to process the data

of an image as they enter the input buffer, choosing a buffer
filling threshold and suppressing the reading of at least one

image, whereby the image may have been displayed one or more
times or not at all on exceeding the threshold.
Synchronizing process according to claim 4, in which the
device is a low rate videophone, an image acquired from among

n only is transmitted, the control means being able to control
the display of n times the same image whilst the processing

means process the following image, characterized in that it
consists of choosing processing means able to process an image

throughout the display time of p images, p being smaller than
n, the processed image then being recorded and its display

controlled after the display of p times the preceding image. 
Synchronizing process according to claim 5, the videophone having
a display monitor and a camera, characterized in that it consists of

taking as the arbitrary clock the scanning clock of said camera.
Synchronizing process according to claim 4, in which the device is a
videophone conference or high rate videophone system or a television set,

in which all the acquired images re transmitted, characterized in that it
consists of choosing processing means able to process an image during

the display time of another image and in that as soon as a predetermined
input buffer filling threshold is exceeded by the arrival of an image I,

the control means authorize the processing of the following image I+1,
the image I not being displayed, the display of the image I+1 taking place

just after the display of the image I-1.
Synchronizing process according to claim 4, in which the device is a
videophone conference system or a television set, in which all the

acquired images are transmitted, characterized in that as soon as a
predetermined input buffer filling threshold is exceeded by the arrival

of an image I, the control means control the repetition of the display
of the image I during the processing of the image I+k, the k-1 intermediate

images not being displayed and the image I+k being displayed
just after its processing.
Synchronizing process according to any one of the claims 4, 7 and 8,
characterized in that the filling threshold is chosen as a function of the

information rate arriving at the decoder input, so that the wait between
the end of the processing of an image and its display does not exceed
 the
duration of one image.
