<ABSTRACT>
A transcutaneous electroneural stimulation (TENS) 
device employing microprocessor control of carrier pulse 

frequency, modulation pulse frequency, intensity, and 
frequency/amplitude modulation factors has been developed. 

The microprocessor monitors battery status and keypad-entered 
commands that select the various TENS modalities, 

and generates the driver signals to produce the output 
waveform. The microprocessor is programmed to calculate 

all stimulation parameters, which are stored in nonvolatile 
memory to provide concise and predictable programmed 

functions which can be updated as required. By selecting 
a desired program, the system may be programmed for either 

pain relief or the reduction of edema in the application 
area. The output pulse train employs a pulse modulation 

scheme which is carrier frequency tuned for location-specific 
applications by matching the carrier frequency to 

the electrode/tissue load. By pulse modulating the high 
frequency carrier and matching the carrier frequency to the 

electrode/tissue load, more efficient energy transfer is 
realized, and the unpleasant burning sensation associated 

with most TENS stimulation units is virtually eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a TENS-type 
therapeutic device, in general, and to a microprocessor 
controlled TENS-type system, in particular. The use of electrical energy for the control of pain 
is well known. Although the specific physiological 
explanations underlying electrically derived pain control 
are not fully understood, the effects are quite real and 
provide a non-drug, non-surgical and non-psychiatric method 
of pain control which can be applied to a wide variety of 
painful conditions. Transcutaneous electroneural stimulation (TENS) is 
a proven and accepted means of providing relief from many 
kinds of acute and chronic pain symptoms. It is an 
attractive alternative to pharmaceuticals since it has no 
addictive properties. In addition, there are no known side 
effects to properly applied TENS therapy. Several theories have been developed to explain the 
neurophysiological mechanisms through which TENS can affect 
pain perception. The earliest accepted explanation is the 
gate control theory, first postulated by Melzack and Wall 
in 1965 (Melzack, R. Wall P. D., "Pain mechanisms: a new 
theory," Science, Vol. 150, pp. 971-979, 1965). This 
theory used data from animal experiments to predict that 
stimulation of afferent nerves could inhibit transmission 
from both noxious and non-noxious inputs. However, 
subsequent research with commercially available stimulators 
has demonstrated that TENS efficacy cannot be explained by 
gate control theory alone (Schmidt R. D., "Presynaptic 
inhibition in the vertebrate central nervous system," 
Ergebn.Physicol., Vol. 63 pp. 20-86, 1971).  More recent studies (Eriksson, M. B. E., Sjolund, B. 
H. and Nielzen, S., "Long term results of peripheral 
conditioning stimulation as an analgesic measure in chronic 
pain, " Pain, Vol. 6, pp. 335-347, 1979) have shown that 
TENS efficacy can be greatly enhanced for some patients by 
supplementing new stimulation techniques when 
unsatisfactory results are obtained with conventional 
stimulation. One popular technique incorporates experience 
from Chinese electroacupuncture. The discovery that the 
effects of this technique, as well as those from 
acupuncture, can be reversed with an opioid antagonist, 
e.g. naloxone hydrochloride (Sjolund, B. H. and Eriksson, 
M. B. E., "The influence of naloxone on analgesia produced 
by peripheral conditioning stimulation, Brain Res., Vol. 
173, pp. 295-301, 1979, and Mayer, D. J., Price, D. D., and
