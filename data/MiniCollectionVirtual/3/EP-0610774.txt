<ABSTRACT>
A method for automatic lineage assignment of acute 
leukemias. Eight four-parameter list mode data files are 

acquired with a flow cytometer in the following sequence: 1. 
unstained; 2. isotype controls; 3. CD10 FITC, CD19 PE; 4. CD20 

FITC, CD5 PE; 5. CD3 FITC, CD22 PE; 6. CD7 FITC, CD33 PE; 7. 
HLADR FITC, CD13 PE and 8. CD34 FITC, CD38 PE. First, data 

files 3 - 8 are clustered employing an algorithm based on 
nearest neighbors. The clusters are then associated across 

the data files to form cell populations, using the assumption 
of light scatter invariance across tubes for each population. 

The mean positions of each cell population are compared to a 
decision tree which identifies normal cell populations. To 

identify leukemic cell populations, the algorithm eliminates 
normal cell populations from the data space and the remaining 

populations are classified as B-lineage ALL, T-lineage ALL, 
AML, AUL, B-CLL or unknown.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to immunophenotyping of
normal and abnormal blood cell populations by flow cytometry.Acute leukemias are a heterogeneous group of diseases
arising from the clonal expansion of malignant hematopoietic
progenitor cells. The heterogeneity of the disease is
evidenced by the large diversity of antigenic and light
scatter profiles of leukemic cells in patients diagnosed with
acute leukemia. This heterogeneity and a poor correlation
with normal cell differentiation lead to a lack of consensus
in the panel of reagents employed for classification and a
lack of uniform criteria for lineage assignment. However, the
antigen profiles in acute leukemias are of clinical importance
as the various subgroups identified have been associated with
different prognoses and serve as a guide for different
treatment protocols.Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry has significantly
reduced inter-observer variations in the subclassification of
leukemias and has been shown to be particularly powerful in
discriminating between myeloid, B-lymphoid and T-lymphoid
leukemias. However, traditional flow immunophenotyping may
produce biased results due to heterogeneity in leukemias. At
the present time there is a lack of consensus in the panel of
reagents employed for classification and a lack of uniform 
criteria for lineage assignment.Traditional flow immunophenotyping is based on finding
an optimal light scatter gate followed by application of
marker settings on the immunofluorescence parameters. The
distribution of the cells in a display of forward and
orthogonal light scatter varies considerably between
leukemias, however, and does not fit the normal lymphocyte,
blast, monocyte and granulocyte light scatter regions. In
addition to difficulties in assessing the appropriate light
scatter gate, there are complications arise when attempting to
define "negative" versus "positive" immunofluorescence
staining in immunophenotyping of leukemias.In multidimensional flow cytometric analysis the bias
which is introduced by employing gates on light scatter
parameters is eliminated because all parameters are analyzed
simultaneously. Cluster algorithms (Salzman, G.C., et al.
1991. Cytometry Suppl. 5:64), principal components analysis
(Leary, J.F., et al. 1988. Cytometry Suppl. 2:99), neural
nets (Frankel, D.S., et al. 1989. Cytometry 10:540) and
PAINT-A-GATE analysis (U.S. Patent No. 4,845,653) are among
the approaches used for multidimensional analysis. These
algorithms permit a more precise identification of cell

A method for analyzing data generated by flow cytometric
analysis
 of multiple aliquots of a sample containing cells to
be analyzed, wherein the cells in each aliquot are stained

with at least two monoclonal antibodies conjugated to
fluorochromes which are distinguishable from each other by

flow cytometric analysis, the method comprising:

a) acquiring listmode data files for light scatter
and fluorescence for each aliquot;
b) identifying cell clusters in each aliquot by
cluster analysis of the data files for each aliquot, and;
c) identifying cell populations in the sample by
linking the cell clusters across the data files on the basis

of at least one common parameter.
The method according to Claim 1 further comprising the
step of determining the lineage of the cell population by

comparing the fluorescence and light scatter characteristics
of the population to fluorescence and light scatter

characteristics expected for a selected lineage.
The method according to Claim 2 further comprising
removing normal cell population data from the data files and

determining the lineage of remaining abnormal cell
populations. 
The method according to Claim 3 wherein the lineage of
remaining leukemic cell populations is determined.
A method for determining the lineage of acute leukemia

a) staining the cells in each one of multiple
aliquots of the sample with at least two monoclonal antibodies

distinguishable from the other fluorochromes in the aliquot by

flow cytometric analysis;
b) acquiring listmode data files for light scatter

c) identifying cell clusters in each aliquot by
nearest neighbor analysis of the data files for each aliquot;
d) identifying cell populations in the sample by
linking the cell clusters across the data files on the basis

of common light scatter properties;
e) identifying normal cell populations by comparing
the fluorescence and light scatter characteristics of the cell

f) removing the data for the normal cell populations

CD19, CD20, CD5, CD3, CD22, CD7, CD33, HLADR, CD13, CD34 and

CD38, and the fluorescence and light scatter characteristics

ALL, T-lineage ALL, AML, AUL, and B-CLL.
