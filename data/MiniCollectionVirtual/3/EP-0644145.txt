<ABSTRACT>
A coating film transfer tool having a structure for 
allowing use as a kind of so-called writing tool and 

replacement of a coating film transfer tape. By placing a 
coating film transfer head (H) in a coating film transfer 

tape replacement position, a coating film transfer tape (T) 
can be guided in parallel with its winding attitude about 

pay-out reel (6) and winding reel (7) by a leading pressing 
part (35a), and the coating film transfer tape (T) can be 

easily detached from the head (H). On the other hand, by the 
head (H) in an application position, the coating film 

transfer tape (T) is guided by the leading pressing part 
(35a), approximately directly facing to gripping surfaces 

(2a, 2b) of the case. Accordingly, the coating film transfer 
tape (T) can be tightly pressed against a sheet surface or 

the like by holding the case (2) itself like a writing tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating film transfer 
tool for transferring a coating film such as a corrective 
paint layer and an adhesive layer on a coating film transfer 
tape onto a paper surface or the like, and more particularly 
to a cartridge-type coating film transfer tool allowing 
replacement of coating film transfer tapes, and having a 
structure to be usable with a writing tool-like feeling, as 
if handling a pencil or the like. As an example of this kind of coating film transfer tool, 
we proposed a coating film transfer tool according to the preamble 
of Claim 1, disclosed in 
Japanese Laid-open Utility Patent No. 5-13800. The coating film transfer tool is mainly used as an 
erasing tool for correcting errors or the like, and 
comprises, as shown in FIG. 17, a pay-out reel (c) with a 
coating film transfer tape (b) wound thereabout and a winding 
reel (d) for collecting the coating film transfer tape (b) as  
 
it is used contained rotatably provided in a case (a). This 
case (a) has a coating film transfer head (f) projecting from 
a front end thereof. The coating film transfer head (f) is 
for pressing the coating film transfer tape (b) against a 
transfer area (e.g., a correction area) (e), and is 
structured such that the coating film transfer tape (b) paid 
out of the pay-out reel (c) is dragged through a pressing 
part (g) in the front end of the head (f), and wound and held 
about the winding reel (d). The case (a) is formed in a flat box-like shape, and has 
contour shape and size and width size sufficient for 
containing the pay-out reel (c) and winding reel (d). Flat 
front and back surfaces of the case (a), that is, front and 
back surfaces relative to the sheet surface of FIG. 17 
provide gripping surfaces in operating the tool, and the 
pressing part (g) in the front end of the head (f) is 
arranged such that the coating film transfer tape (b) is 
guided approximately directly facing against the gripping 
surfaces. Then, in order to erase an error by using the coating 
film transfer tool, the gripping surfaces (both front and 
back surfaces) of case (a) are held by fingers, and the case 
(a) is moved vertically to the sheet surface of FIG. 17, 
while the coating film transfer tape (b) is tightly pressed 
against the correction area (e) by means of the pressing part  
 
(g) in the front end of the head (f). In such manner, a 
corrective paint layer of the coating film transfer tape (b) 
in the pressing part (g) of the front end of the head (f) is 
applied onto the
