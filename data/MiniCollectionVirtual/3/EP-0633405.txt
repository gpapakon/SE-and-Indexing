<ABSTRACT>
A method for the manufacture of a ball coupling element 
(1) according to which a ball head (6) is inserted into 

a bush (12) of anti-friction material having first and 
second portions (14,15) , the first portion (14) having 

a spherical inner seat (17) for partially housing the 
ball head (6) and being defined externally by a 

cylindrical surface (16), the second portion (15) being 
defined internally by a substantially cylindrical surface 

(18) and varying in thickness; the second portion (15) 
is permanently deformed so that its inner surface (18) 

retains the ball head (6) and is calibrated so as to 
obtain a portion (15a) defined externally by a 

cylindrical surface (27) and having a diameter equal to 
that of the first portion (14), before force fitting the 

deformed bush (12) into a seat (4) in a body (2) of the 
element (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing a ball coupling element. The invention relates in particular to a method for 
manufacturing a ball coupling element of the type which 
includes a body for connecting to an associated control 
rod and having a cylindrical seat, and a ball head 
adapted to be connected to a further rod and coupled to 
the body by means of an interposed bush made of anti-friction 
material which positively engages the seat 
itself. In known coupling elements of the type described above, 
the head is fitted to the body by first assembling the 
ball head and the bush and then inserting this assembly 
into the seat in the body. Normally, the ball head-bush assembly is made by 
inserting the ball head into a cylindrical bush, 
preferably manufactured by sintering, with an inner 
diameter which is slightly larger than the diameter of 
the ball head. Next, a swelling operation is carried out 
on the bush, whereby compression is exerted on the bush 
until it is permanently deformed so as to form an inner, 
spherical seat which rotatably engages the head. At the 
end of the swelling operation, as the outer surface of  
 
the bush is now convex as a result of compression, it is 
essential to carry out an operation, normally turning, to 
return the bush to its original geometry and adapt its 
outer diameter to the diameter of the seat in the 
aforesaid body. However, the manufacturing process described involves 
relatively long production times and high manufacturing 
costs, owing to the fact that the bush must be restored 
to its cylindrical shape after swelling and to the fact 
that part of the material constituting the bush is wasted 
during this operation in returning it to a cylindrical 
form. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
method for the manufacture of a ball coupling element 
which overcomes the aforesaid disadvantages simply and 
economically. The present invention provides a method for the 
manufacture of a ball coupling element, this method being 
characterised in that it includes the steps of 
manufacturing a bush which is symmetrical about an axis 
and includes first and second coaxial portions, the first 
portion having a concave inner surface which is concave 
towards the second portion, and the second portion 
varying in thickness along the said axis and being 
defined by a substantially cylindrical inner surface;  
 
inserting into the bush a ball head with a diameter 
slightly smaller than an inner diameter of the said 
second

the steps of forming a bush (12) which is symmetrical 
about an axis (13) and includes coaxial first (14) and 

second (15) portions, the first portion (14) having a 
concave inner surface (17) facing the second portion 

(15), and the second portion (15) varying in thickness 
along the said axis (13) and being defined by a 

substantially cylindrical inner surface (18); inserting 
into the bush (12) a ball head (6) with a diameter 

slightly smaller than an inner diameter of the said 
second portion (15); and permanently deforming the said 

second portion (15) such that its inner surface (18) 

encloses the said ball head (6).

it includes the step of calibrating the said second 

portion (15) during the permanent deformation thereof. 
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the first portion (14) is formed 

with a first cylindrical outer surface (16), and in that 
during its permanent deformation the said second portion 

(15) is deformed so as to obtain a portion (15a) which is 
defined externally by a second cylindrical surface (27), 

coaxial to the said first surface (16), and the outer 
 

diameter of which is the same as the outer diameter of 
the said first portion (14).

first portion (14) has a spherical shape complementary to 
that of the ball head (6).
