<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to optical waveguides which are used to 
propagate electromagnetic waves of the waveband used for optical 
signals in communications systems, particularly those waveguides 
used to carry polarized waves through polarization maintaining optical fibers. Two mutually orthogonally polarized modes are able to 
propagate in single mode symmetrical dielectric waveguides. When 
the cross-section of the waveguide is perfectly circular, the two 
modes maintain the same phase. Thus, no differences in phase 
occurs between the two waves, allowing the wave to maintain its 
original polarity. Optical fibers (dielectric waveguides) having cores of 
elliptical cross-section are well known to have good polarization 
holding properties when the difference between the refractive 
indices of the fiber core and cladding are relatively large. This 
large difference in refractive index between core and cladding 
maximizes the difference between the propagation constants of the 
two fundamental modes of a signal propagated along the major and 
minor axes of the elliptical cross-section and also minimizes the 
coupling of the two fundamental modes. This results in reliable 
pickup of an optical wave signal band through the fiber in the 
fundamental mode having an electric field parallel to the major 
axis of the ellipse at the opposite end of the fiber. In practice however, it is difficult to attain perfect 
alignment of the wave source and the major axis of the fiber. 
Instead of single mode propagation along the major axis of the 
ellipse, the wave is propagated in two orthogonally polarized  
 
fundamental modes aligned with both the major and minor axes of the 
ellipse. The elliptical configuration of the optical fiber tends 
to hold these two fundamental modes in alignment with these axes 
throughout the length of the fiber. It is also known, as shown in U.S. Patent 4,307,938 (Dyott), 
that unwanted higher order modes are cut off in the region of 
maximum difference between the orthogonally polarized fundamental 
propagation modes in elliptical cored optical fibers. Even 
accidental coupling between the two fundamental modes will reduce 
the useful band width of the fiber or wave guide. A fiber having a 
core of elliptical cross-section could be provided in which there 
was excellent preservation of the polarization of the transmitted 
signal through the fiber in the operating region in which high 
order modes of the signal are cut off, but the group velocities of 
the two fundamental modes of the
