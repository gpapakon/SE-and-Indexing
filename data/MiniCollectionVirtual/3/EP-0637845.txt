<ABSTRACT>
A capacitor with a metal-oxide dielectric layer (14, 115, 
1542) is formed with an upper electrode layer (15, 107, 1543) 

that is electrically connected to an underlying circuit element 
(11, 103, 1525, 1526). The capacitor may be used in forming 

storage capacitors for DRAM and NVRAM cells. After forming an 
underlying circuit element (112, 1525, 1526), such as a 

source/drain region of a transistor (103, 141, 142), a metal-oxide 
capacitor is formed over the circuit element. An opening 

(41, 104, 1544) is formed through the capacitor and extends to 
the circuit element (11, 103, 1525, 1526). An insulating spacer 

(51, 116, 1545) is formed, and a conductive member (61, 
117,1546) is formed that electrically connects the circuit 

element (11, 103, 1525, 1526) to the upper electrode layer (15, 
107, 1543) of the metal-oxide capacitor. Devices including DRAM 

and NVRAM cells (100, 140) and methods of forming them are 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor
devices, and in particular, to semiconductor devices having
capacitors.Capacitors are used in many types of semiconductor
devices. Within memory devices, such as a dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) cell or a non-volatile random access
memory (NVRAM) cell, the capacitor acts as a storage
capacitor. To achieve higher capacitance in a memory cell,
capacitor electrode surface are may be increased or a higher
permittivity material can be used for the capacitor dielectric.
A capacitor electrode can be made of a plurality of layers such
that the capacitor electrode surrounds much of the other
capacitor electrode as shown in EP 0 430 404 A1. In that
publication, one of the capacitor electrode overlies and
underlies portions of the other capacitor electrode. Such a
capacitor requires additional processing steps to form the
surrounding capacitor electrode that includes a plurality of
conductive layers.Metal-oxide dielectric layers may be used in storage
capacitors for the DRAM or NVRAM cells because the metal-oxide
dielectric layers may have a high-permittivity or
ferroelectric properties. As used in this specification, high-permittivity
means a permittivity higher than the permittivity
of silicon dioxide.A limitation of capacitors with metal-oxide dielectric
layers is the ability to integrate the formation of the
capacitors into the process flow for semiconductor devices. A
specific example using an NVRAM cell illustrates some of the
problems. FIG. 1 includes a circuit diagram of an NVRAM cell 1
with a ferroelectric capacitor 2 and a transistor 3. One
electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor 2 is coupled to the
drive line (DL), and the other electrode is coupled to a 
source/drain region of the transistor 3. The transistor 3
further includes another source/drain region coupled to a bit
line (BL) and a gate electrode coupled to a word line (WL).Stacked capacitors have been used in DRAM cells as can
be seen in EP 0 521 676 A1. Although stacked capacitors can
be formed relatively easily with DRAM cells, the same does not
hold when forming an NVRAM cell because of process
integration issues. For an NVRAM cell, the transistor is formed
in the substrate, a conductive plug is formed to a source/drain
region of the transistor, and the ferroelectric capacitor is
formed over the conductive plug. An integration problem is the
presence of the conductive plug while the ferroelectric
capacitor is formed. Many types of conductive plugs include
silicon or a
