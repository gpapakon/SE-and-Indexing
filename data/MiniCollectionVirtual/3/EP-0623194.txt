<ABSTRACT>
A bearing split outer ring (40) for mounting in a bearing housing (12), the split outer ring (40) having a first-portion (44) subtending somewhat more than 180 degrees of arc and a second portion (42) subtending somewhat less than 180 degrees of arc. The first and second portions (44, 42) of the split outer ring (40) being sized with respect to the bearing housing (12) to provide an interference fit therein. In another aspect of the present invention, this is accomplished by providing a method of assembly of a housed bearing. The assembly steps comprise providing a split outer ring (40) with two unequal portions, retaining the split outer ring (40) over an inner raceway with rolling elements (30) therebetween to form a subassembly, positionning the subassembly in a housing base such that the ends of the outer ring are all contained within the housing base, and thereafter, mounting a housing cover over the subassembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rolling bearing assemblies with 
split rings and, more particularly, to those with a split outer ring. Many applications, such as line shafting, for example, 
require bearings that are installed radially rather than 
axially, over the end of a shaft. Such bearings used in the 
main bearing positions of two-cycle and four-cycle engines 
typically use split (or fractured) outer rings. To avoid 
fretting of the outer rings and to reduce wear of the 
bearing seats, the outer rings are made oversize to engage 
the bearing seats with a moderate interference fit. The normal assembly procedure is to place a split cage and 
roller assembly, or other complement of rolling elements, 
on the crankshaft journal and then install the split outer 
ring over them. A snap ring or wire ring may be placed 
around the outer ring to hold the halves together. The 
crankshaft with the split outer ring and rolling elements 
is then fitted into bearing seats in the engine block. A 
cover providing the other half of the bearing seat is then 
installed over the split outer ring, and the assembly is 
bolted together. Traditionally, the outer ring is split in two places 180 
degrees apart, see eg. US-A-1481705. A dowel pin in the engine block engages the 
split outer ring to locate the race axially and to 
orientate the split. Typically the ring splits are 
orientated so they are located 10 to 30 degrees from the 
parting line between the engine block and the cover. Fitting the split outer ring in the engine block causes the 
halves of the outer ring to shift out of alignment as one  
 
half is compressed radially inward by the interference fit 
while the other half is free and not compressed. When the 
cover is installed and bolted to the engine block, the 
split surfaces of the outer ring bind together. This can 
result in mismatch of the outer ring at the split 
locations, causing undesirable noise or premature fatigue 
failure of the outer ring or rolling elements. Some manufacturers have tried to overcome this problem by 
installing the outer rings with the ring split plane 90 
degrees to the split line between the engine block and 
cover. Such a configuration is unsatisfactory because the 
split portion of the outer ring is then located in the most 
heavily loaded part of the load zone. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a bearing split outer ring and housing assembly of 
the type providing a raceway for rolling elements formed on 
the inside of said split outer ring
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A bearing split outer ring (40) and housing assembly 
of the type providing a raceway for rolling elements (30) 

formed on the inside of said split outer ring to facilitate 
rotation of a shaft (32), said split outer ring (40) being 

of the type split into an arcuate first portion (44) and an 
arcuate second portion (42), said bearing housing having a 

housing base (12) and a housing cover (34) the combination 
enclosing said split outer ring (40) and providing an 

interference fit therewith, said bearing split outer ring 
and housing assembly being characterised by:
 
   said first portion (44) of said split outer ring (40) 

subtending a first length of arc; and said second portion 
(42) of said split outer ring (40) subtending a second 

length of arc, said first length and said second length 
being unequal to one another, the combination of said first 

and second portions forming said annular split outer ring, 
the ends of said outer ring portions all being contained 

within the housing base (12). 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein said first 
portion (44) of said split outer ring subtends a first 

length of between 185 and 205 degrees of arc and said 

second portion (42) of said split outer ring subtends a 
second length of between 175 and 155 degrees of arc. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
first and second portions (44, 42) of the split outer ring 

include a groove (48) in a radially outward surface for 
receiving a retainer ring. 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3 and further 
comprising orientating means for maintaining orientation of  

 
the split outer ring (40) with respect to the roller 

bearing housing. 
An assembly according to claim 4, wherein the 
orientating means comprises projection means extending from 

the housing base (12) into engagement with an aperture (45) 
of the second portion (42) of the split outer ring (40).
