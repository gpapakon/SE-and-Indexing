<ABSTRACT>
The problem of noise enhancement is eliminated in communications 
systems by predistorting the amplitude of the transmitted information signal in a 

manner which compensates for the amplitude distortion introduced in a portion of 
the communications channel. In the disclosed embodiments, the communications 

system includes two signal transceivers (101,102) 
which communicate with one another 

through a communications channel. The communications channel includes two-wire 
subscriber loops adjacent to each signal transceiver with a four-wire transmission 

path disposed between the subscriber loops. Each transceiver transmits an 
information signal which, depending on the system noise characteristics, is 

predistorted to compensate for all or a portion of the amplitude distortion introduced 
in a subscriber loop adjacent to that signal transceiver. The predistortion necessary 

to provide such compensation is determined at each transceiver in response to a 
received narrowband signal at that transceiver. Advantageously, this narrowband 

signal (107) may be that used to disable echo cancellers and/suppressors 
in the communications channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communications systems and, more 
particularly, to a technique for compensating for distortion introduced in a portion of 
a communications channel. Distortion compensation can be categorized as being either 
postdistortion or predistortion compensation or a combination of both. 
Postdistortion compensation is compensation that is provided after distortion is 
introduced into an information signal while predistortion compensation is 
compensation for distortion prior to the introduction of the distortion. In many communications applications, the application of known 
distortion compensation techniques results in signal noise enhancement. This results 
from the fact that the information signal is subjected to more distortion than the 
noise. One example of this is in dial-up modem applications, where the 
communications channel includes two-wire subscriber loops, each having an 
associated amplitude versus frequency distortion characteristic, and a four-wire 
transmission system therebetween. Most of the signal noise is introduced in the 
four-wire transmission system. Accordingly, any information signal propagating 
through the communications channel is subjected to amplitude distortion within both 
subscriber loops while the noise is only subjected to amplitude distortion within one 
subscriber loop. The process of using linear equalizers to compensate for the 
distortion to which the information signal has been subjected results in over-equalization 
or enhancement of the noise signal. The problem of noise enhancement is not severe for typical voice and 
low-speed data applications. However, as the data rate increases, such noise 
enhancement becomes intolerable as it substantially interferes with attainment of 
required bit error rates. Accordingly, compensation for such noise enhancement is 
required. One prior art technique for addressing noise enhancement involves the 
use of decision feedback equalizers in each receiver to "whiten", i.e., provide a 
substantially flat amplitude-versus-frequency spectrum for the noise at the equalizer 
output. The problem with this technique is that a decision feedback equalizer is an 
inherently complex device to implement and is subject to error propagation. Another 
technique, known as the "Tomlinson" technique, is to adapt a decision feedback  
 
equalizer using a priori known data, thereby eliminating the problem of error 
propagation, and then transmitting the coefficients of this equalizer to a remote 
transmitter wherein
