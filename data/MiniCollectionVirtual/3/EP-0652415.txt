<ABSTRACT>
A thin film thickness measuring device is disclosed. The device includes an 
illuminator, a receiver and a beam deflector. The illuminator provides a collimated input light 

beam along an input axis. The receiver includes a lens and a diaphragm having a pinhole 
located at a focal point of the lens and receives a collimated output light beam along an 

output axis parallel to the input axis. The beam deflector is translatable at least along a 
scanning axis parallel to the input axis. The beam deflector directs the input light beam 

towards a sample and the output light beam from the sample towards the receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems and methods for non-destructive
quality control in general and to optical systems and
methods for measuring the thickness and index of refraction of
thin films, in particular.Optical measuring instruments are typically utilized in the
microelectronic industry for non-contact, non-destructive
measurement of the thickness of thin films. Two main systems are
utilized, spectrophotometers (or reflectometers) and
ellipsometers. The following U.S. Patents represent the prior
art:
For ellipsometers: 5,166,752, 5,061,072, 5,042,951,
4,957,368, 4,681,450, 4,653,924, 4,647,207 and 4,516,855.For spectrophotometers: 5,181,080, 5,159,412, 5,120,966,
4,999,014 and 4,585,348.In US 4,826,321 Coates et al describe a system for measuring thin
film thicknesses by directing a plane polarized laser light beam
to the film at the Brewster angle of the substrate and by
measuring the intensity changes between a measurement from the
substrate alone and from the film coated substrate.EP 558781A1 describes a method an apparatus for exposure of
substrates which uses a one-dimensional translation apparatus to
translate the optical head. The two prior art systems are illustrated as Figs 1A and 1B,
respectively, to which reference is now made. The
spectrophotometer utilizes the fact that light beams reflected
off thin film boundaries, will interfere one with another.
Specifically, the spectrophotometer of Fig 1A measures the
reflectance of selected points of a sample 10 as a function of
the light wavelength, usually in the visible of near UV spectral
ranges. Computer analysis of the detected spectral reflection
function, especially its minima and maxima, provides the
thickness, and in some cases, also the index of refraction of the
measured film.The spectrophotometer typically includes a transmitter 12 with a
light source and appropriate optics, a beam splitter 14, an
objective lens 16, a tube lens 18 and a receiver 20 which
includes optical and electronic means for measurement of light
intensity as a function of the input light wavelength. The
transmitter 12 produces a collimated light beam 22 which is
deflected by the beam splitter 14 and focused on the sample 10 by
the objective 
lens 16. The reflected beam, labeled 24, is collected by the microscope imaging optics
(lenses 16 and 18) on a spectroscopic measurement unit within the receiver 20.In order to measure a multiplicity of points on the sample 10, sample 10 is
placed on an x-y stage 26. X-Y stage 26 is typically very precise and heavy
