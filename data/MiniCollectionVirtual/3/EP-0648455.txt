<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure and a device for exchanging articles in self-service shops, the articles being placed on walls (7) which are hung on fixed structural members, such as posts (5), beams, frame sections, shelves and the like, and are removably arranged thereon. The essence of the invention consists in the fact that the walls (7) are detached from the fixed structural members by means of a mobile device for the purpose of equipping them with articles, are re-equipped in the detached state and subsequently hung on the fixed structural members again by means of the device, or in the fact that equipped walls (7) are merely exchanged using the mobile device. To carry out the procedure, it is proposed that the device consists of a mobile lifting apparatus (1) which has a supporting frame (3) intended for receiving the walls (7).
