<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dilatation balloon
catheter, useful for medical procedures such as angioplasty,
which permits fluid flow, e.g., perfusion (blood
flow), around the outer peripheral surfaces of the balloon
when the latter is inflated and in contact with
surrounding surfaces such as the inner lining of the
walls or the atheromatous plaque of a blood vessel
(artery or vein) such as a coronary artery, as well as to
methods of making and using the same.Dilatation balloon catheters are well known and used
daily in medical practice for life-saving coronary angioplasty
procedures wherein atheromatous plaque adhering to
a blood vessel wall and blocking or restricting blood
flow therein is compressed to reestablish and/or increase
blood flow by dilating the lumen of the artery. Compression
of the plaque is effected by inflation of the balloon
while it is positioned in the blood vessel so that
it is located adjacent to and surrounded by the plaque.Depending on the location of the plaque and the size
of the blood vessel, a pre-shaped and pre-dimensioned
catheter having a pre-shaped and pre-dimensioned inflatable
balloon adhered thereto (by fluid seals), is
selected. The interior of the catheter typically possesses
two lengthwise channels (lumen): one for fluid
inflation of the generally tubular shaped balloon (e.g.,
to an inflated diameter of 1-7 mm, larger or smaller 
diameters being possible) with which it is in sealed
communication, and the other for insertion of a guidewire
running the full length of the catheter to assist in
positioning it during a medical operation.Many such catheters have been disclosed as well as
details of construction, methods of preparation and
methods of use. See, e.g., the disclosures of U.S.
Reissue 33,166 and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,323,071,
4,411,055, 4,571,240, 4,573,470, 4,582,181, 4,597,755,
4,616,653, 4,619,263, 4,638,805, 4,641,654, 4,664,113,
4,692,200, 4,748,982, 4,771,776, 4,771,778, 4,775,371,
4,782,834, 4,790,315 and 4,793,350.One of these references addresses the problem of
occlusion of blood flow during an angioplasty procedure.
See U.S. Patent 4,790,315. As noted therein (column 1),
during an angioplasty procedure, blood flow is cut off
during the period of time the balloon remains inflated.
As a result, the myocardium becomes ischemic with potentially
serious consequences and the patient experiences
chest pain. Thus, inflation duration must necessarily be
relatively short, e.g., typically less than 180 seconds,
commonly less than 150 seconds. Longer inflation

<CLAIMS>
A balloon catheter comprising a catheter shaft
(1) and, mounted on said shaft, an inflatable non-elastomeric

balloon (2) having proximal and distal ends
disposed along the length of said catheter shaft (1),

said balloon (2) when inflated having an outer surface
relief structure characterized in that said catheter

comprises an autoperfusion dilation catheter with a band
(5,6,7) tightly mounted over the outside surface of said

balloon (2) on a line along the length of said catheter
shaft (1) and fixedly attached to said catheter shaft at

or beyond each of said balloon proximal and distal ends,
whereby said band (5,6,7) exerts a force on said balloon

outside surface directed inward toward said catheter
shaft (1) along said line when said balloon (2) is

inflated, whereby a channel (9) is formed in said
balloon outer surface when inflated whereby when said

balloon is fully inflated and exerts pressure on the
inner surface of a blood vessel in which blood is

flowing, blood continues flowing between said outer
surface of said balloon and said inner surface of said

blood vessel.
The autoperfusion catheter of claim 1, wherein
said channel (9) is disposed around said outer surface

of said balloon in a helical-like pattern (5,6).
The autoperfusion catheter of claim 1, wherein
said channel (9) is disposed along one side of said

balloon (2) and not around said balloon.
The autoperfusion catheter of claim 1, 2 or 3
wherein said relief-structure comprises at least two of

said channels (9).
The autoperfusion catheter of any preceding 
claim, wherein said band (5,6,7) maintains said balloon

outer surface in compressive contact with said shaft (1)
along said line wh
en said balloon (2) is inflated.
The autoperfusion catheter of claim 1, wherein
said catheter shaft (1) comprises an outer surface and

said band (7) is disposed in a groove recessed in said
catheter outer surface along said line, whereby said

band substantially does not protrude beyond said outer
surface of said catheter shaft.
The autoperfusion catheter of any preceding
claim, further comprising a radially expandable,

pressure distribution sleeve (8) disposed around said
balloon.
The autoperfusion catheter of claim 1, wherein
said channel (9) is preformed in said balloon during the

thermoplastic molding thereof under elevated temperature
(fig 14).
The autoperfusion catheter of any preceding
claim, wherein the dimensions of said at least one

channel (9) provide blood flow of a volume at least 80-100%
of normal blood flow in a blood vessel when said

balloon (2) is fully inflated in said blood vessel and
exerts pressure on the inner surface of the blood

vessel.
