<ABSTRACT>
To obtain a defined quenching profile in the quenching of metallic workpieces in a liquid bath after a heat treatment, a process is suggested in which the flow velocity of the liquid is adjusted in the region of the workpieces to 10 to 30 m/sec, 0.5 to 1.5 m/sec or 0 m/sec, while at the same time, on the other hand, the liquid volume available for heat exchange is variably adjusted.

Method of quenching metal workpieces in a liquid bath after a heat treatment,
characterised in that, to obtain a presettable quenching profile of a workpiece, the flow

rate of the quenching liquid in the region of the workpiece is adjusted successively in
any order to


a1) 10 to 30 m/s
a2) 0.5 to 1.5 m/s or
a3) 0 m/s,

wherein this flow rate a1), a2), a3) is adjusted with respect to duration and sequence as
a function of the quenching profile preset at any given time, and in that, simultaneously

with every change of flow rate, the liquid volume available for heat exchange is varied
as a function of the quenching profile preset at any given time.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the workpieces in a first step in a
given liquid volume are subjected to a flow rate of 10 to 30 m/s, in a second step

remain in a still liquid bath and with a limited liquid volume, and in a third step, with
the restriction on liquid volume lifted, are subjected to a rate of 0.5 to 1.5 m/s.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that switching from the first to the
second step takes place shortly before reaching the martensitic transformation

temperature.
Method according to either of claims 2 or 3, characterised in that switching from the
second to the third step takes place when the temperature distribution over a workpiece

cross-section has equalised. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that quenching
with a still liquid bath and limited liquid volume is determined by the ratio of charge

mass and charge temperature to liquid mass and liquid temperature.
Method according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
temperature distribution is continuously determined in the workpieces to be quenched.
Method according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the restriction
of liquid volume is determined as a function of the temperature values in the region of

the workpieces to be quenched.
Apparatus for carrying out the methods according to one or more of claims 1 to 7,
with a quenching tank (8) which includes means for carrying the charge (3) of metal

workpieces (12) to be quenched and a liquid bath, in particular oil bath, as well as with
at least one circulating pump (13) for moving the liquid bath, wherein the quenching

tank (8) is arranged directly on a heat treatment furnace, over the quenching tank (8) is
arranged a furnace pre-chamber (5) which is to be connected by a furnace door (2) to a

furnace chamber (1) of the heat treatment furnace and wherein in the furnace pre-chamber
(5) is arranged a lifting device (7) for lifting and lowering the charge (3) out of

and into the quenching tank (8), characterised in that in the furnace pre-chamber (5) is
arranged a covering device which can be lifted and lowered and which when lowered

restricts the liquid volume of the liquid bath which is available to the charge (3) for heat
exchange.
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that the covering device is a hood
(6). 
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterised in that the hood (6) comprises a flap.
Apparatus according to any of claims 8 to 10, characterised in that in the quenching
tank (8) is arranged a nozzle system (10, 11) which is connected to at least one

circulating pump (13) for conducting the liquid at a high flow rate onto the charge (3).
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterised in that the nozzle system (10, 11)
consists of nozzles (10, 11) arranged laterally around the charge (3) and between

individual charge portions.
Apparatus according to any of claims 8, 11 or 12, characterised in that the covering
device is a plate by means of which side walls of the nozzle system (10, 11) can be

closed at the top.
Apparatus according to any of claims 8 to 13, characterised in that between the
workpieces (12) ofthe charge (3) is arranged at least one temperature sensor (4).
Apparatus according to claim 14, characterised in that the temperature sensor (4) is
connected to a regulating unit (9) for monitoring and regulating the individual steps of

the method.
