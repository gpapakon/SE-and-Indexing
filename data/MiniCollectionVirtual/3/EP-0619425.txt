<ABSTRACT>
A suction system arrangement in a motor vehicle tank, comprising a 
pump (11) connected to a filter (12) located in proximity to the tank 

base (10) 
within a calming chamber (13), in which the filter (12) and pump (11) 

are 
connected together by a
 variable-length conduit (21). 
Preferably the pump (11) is connected to the tank by elastic conduit 

elements (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a suction system arrangement in a motor 
vehicle tank which enables tank base deformation to be absorbed. In known fuel suction systems, the fuel pump is positioned within 
a calming chamber and is connected to it via elastic antivibration 
elements. The calming chamber rests on the tank base and 
consequently moves as a result of variations in the tank height 
due to deformation caused by pressure in its interior and the 
weight of the fuel. With such suction system arrangements the fuel pump moves with the 
calming chamber and its distance from the base remains constant, 
allowing all the fuel contained in the tank to be drawn in, 
independently of its deformation. This arrangement can lead to drawbacks in that the pump is 
subjected to continuous movement and its connection to the tank 
roof undergoes stressing. On the other hand with such an 
arrangement it would be impossible to fix the pump relative to the 
tank while at the same time achieving complete intake of the fuel 
contained in the tank. The object of the present invention is to provide a new 
arrangement of the suction system, and in particular of the pump,  
 
which by overcoming the aforesaid drawbacks enables complete 
intake to be achieved in all cases independently of the 
deformation of the tank base. This object is attained according to the present invention by a 
suction system arrangement in a motor vehicle tank, comprising a 
pump connected to a filter located in proximity to the tank base 
within a calming chamber, characterised in that said filter and 
said pump are connected together by a variable-length conduit. Preferably said pump is connected to said tank by elastic conduit 
elements. The characteristics and advantages of the present invention will 
be more apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter 
with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic elevational section through a first 
embodiment of the suction system arrangement according to the 
present invention; and Figure 2 is a schematic elevational section through a second 
embodiment of the suction system arrangement according to the 
present invention. Figure 1 schematically shows a suction system arrangement 
according to the invention within a tank, partially shown by its 
base 10. The arrangement comprises a pump 11 connected to a 
filter 12 located in proximity to the tank base 10 within a 
calming chamber 13. The pump 11 is connected via a first port 14, inserted into an 
elastic
