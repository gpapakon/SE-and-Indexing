<ABSTRACT>
The glass balustrade of an escalator or moving 
walkway passenger conveyor is provided with a rail on 

its side surface, illuminated by a light beam which is 
piped up through the interior of the balustrade panels 

from a light source disposed beneath the outer deck of 
the passenger conveyor. The light source includes a 

neon emitter disposed at the focal point of a parabolic 
mirror so as to provide a parallel band of light which 

is projected into a lens set, which narrows the band of 
light and produces a collimated beam from the narrowed 

light band, which is projected into the bottom of the 
balustrade panels. The light beam is serially reflected 

up through the glass panels to the illuminated rail. 
The rail is a semi-circular rod of glass which is glued 

onto the side of the balustrade, and is formed from a 
glass having substantially the same refractive index as 

the balustrade panel glass. The outer surface of the 
rail may be roughened.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the illumination of a
specific area on a glass balustrade of a passenger
conveyor.Passenger conveyors such as escalators and moving
walkways have been provided with balustrades made from
glass panels for some time. The glass balustrades are
considered to provide an elegant and aesthetically
pleasing appearance, and are architecturally desirable.
The use of glass balustrades has led to various systems
for illuminating the balustrades, and areas around the
balustrades. Examples of such illuminating systems are
found in various patent publications. German
Auslegeschrift No. 1,274,286 discloses an escalator with
a glass balustrade which is illuminated from the area
beneath the supporting structure for the balustrade
inner and outer deck assembly.
A neon light source is mounted directly below
the glass balustrade panels between the latter and the
return path of travel of the handrail.
A reflector adjacent the light source directs light toward the
bottom surface of the balustrade for total reflection therein.
U.S. Patent No.
4,798,274 granted January 17, 1989 to C. Saito discloses
an assembly for illuminating the landing area of an
escalator in a manner which indicates the direction of
travel of the escalator. U.S. Patent no. 4,871,056
granted October 3, 1989 to C. Saito discloses a system
of illuminating the area of an escalator balustrade
located directly beneath the handrail. U.S. Patent No.
5,067,062 granted November 19, 1991 to G. Riilke
discloses a passenger conveyor balustrade illumination
system which utilizes light sources, such as neon
lights, located below the conveyor inner conveyor step
skirts and outer decks which combine with lenses in the
skirts and decks to project a light curtain upwardly on
each side of the balustrade. The projected light 
curtain is then reflected downwardly toward the skirts
and decks by what are called "leg members" which contain
"convex mirror-like curvatures". Essentially, these are
mirrors which reflect light downwardly to illuminate
both sides of each of the balustrades.From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that
passenger conveyors have had their balustrades
illuminated for purposes of added safety; aesthetic
enhancement; conveying information; and the like.The aim of this invention is to provide a
passenger conveyor with a glass balustrade-illuminating
system which is operable to illuminate a narrow
light-emitting rail that is mounted on the balustrades,
preferably on the sides thereof facing the conveyor
steps or treads.The invention
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An illumination system for an escalator or moving
walkway, said system comprising:


a) a glass balustrade;
b) an inner and outer deck assembly flanking a
lower end portion of said glass balustrade

with a bottom surface of said balustrade being
disposed within said deck assembly;
c) a light source disposed in said deck assembly;
d) light gathering means adjacent to said light
source and operable to provide a parallel ray

light beam and direct said light beam toward
said bottom surface of said balustrade at an

angle of incidence which results in light from
said light beam being refracted into the

interior of said glass balustrade;
e) a light-refracting rail disposed on a surface
of said glass balustrade at a location spaced

upwardly away from said bottom surface of said
balustrade; and
f) said glass balustrade providing means for
reflecting said light beam internally of said

glass balustrade, and refracting said light
beam into said light-refracting rail to

differentially illuminate said rail on said
glass balustrade.
An illumination system as claimed in Claim 1,
further comprising lens means interposed between said

light gathering means and said bottom surface of said
balustrade for focusing and narrowing said light beam.
An illumination system as claimed in Claim 2,
wherein said lens means includes a collimating lens for

producing a parallel ray light beam directed into said
bottom surface of said balustrade. 
An illumination system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein said light-refracting rail is formed from

a glass having substantially the same index of
refraction as said glass balustrade.
An illumination system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein said light-refracting rail has an

exterior roughened surface for diffusely refracting
light therethrough.
An illumination system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein said light gathering means is a parabolic

mirror.
An illumination system as claimed in Claim 6,
wherein said light source is positioned at the focal

point of said parabolic mirror.
