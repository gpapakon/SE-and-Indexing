<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to devices for
the acquisition of a signal generated by a sensor, and
more specifically relates to a circuit for recognition of
the detonation in an internal combustion engine,
comprising an input impedance adaptation circuit and a
"sample and hold" circuit for storing the signal.The use of accelerometric sensors for detecting the
detonation in an internal combustion engine is known in
the prior art. Such sensors provide an output voltage
which, typically, must be acquired by a digital or
analogue processing circuit. The processing circuit
normally forms part of a central electronic processor
within the engine compartment. It is therefore necessary
to carry the voltage signal from the accelerometric
sensor, naturally installed on the engine, to the central
electronic processor.A screened cable is used for this purpose because of the
strong electromagnetic disturbances present in the engine
compartment. Moreover, in prior art circuits use is
typically made of an input impedance adaptation circuit
and an acquisition and storage circuit, better known as
a sample and hold circuit, to permit connection, for
example, to an analogue-to-digital converter. This arrangement has, however, certain disadvantages. The
screened cable used to carry the signal from the sensor to
the circuit has a parasitic capacitance with respect to
ground, which causes degradation of the signal emitted by
the accelorimetric sensor. This parasitic capacitance is,
moreover, dependent on the length of the cable and is
therefore difficult to compensate.In known prior art circuits it is moreover necessary to
maintain the output signal to permit acquisition of the
signal itself by the analogue-to-digital converter.US-A-4 816 713 relates to a device for measuring dynamic
entities, such as a vibration or an acceleration, comprising
a sensor of piezoelectric type connected to a FET
amplifier of unitary gain. In particular, the sensor
includes two piezoelectric crystals sandwiched and compressed
between an external electrode of a U-shaped construction
and an internal electrode, which are connected to the
source and the gate of the FET for cancelling the effect of
the capacitance of the piezoelectric elements which reduces
the effective voltage gain. This device is specifically
designed for piezoelectric crystals and can operate
correctly only if the capacitance of the connections is
small with respect to the capacitance of the crystals.GB-A-1 442 655 relates to an amplifying system comprising
a coaxial
