<ABSTRACT>
It is known to fit the front hood (1) of a motor vehicle with a filter (5) to clean the fresh air supplied to the interior of the vehicle. According to the invention, the fresh air is taken in through a shared intake aperture (4) and it passes through two separate filters (6). The fresh air cleaned in each filter (6) is then taken separately to a shared air manifold (13) in which is fitted the blower of a heating and/or air conditionning installation. The cleaned fresh air is taken on from there in the usual way.

A device for introducing fresh air into the passenger compartment of a 
vehicle with a front bonnet (1) with a filter device (5) with two filters (6) 

mounted on its rear side, the said filter device (5) connected to an air 
collection compartment (13) in the bulkhead region (3) of the vehicle, from 

which a fan (14) sucks air and blows it to air outlets opening into the 
passenger compartment of the vehicle, wherein the fresh air inlets (4) are 

provided at the height of the filter device (5) in the front bonnet (1),
 
characterised in that the fresh air stream is divided into two part-streams 

after passing through the fresh air inlets (4) and the part-streams are routed 
around the filters (6) and flow through them in an ascending manner and 

that the purified fresh air is channelled separately from each filter (6) into 
the common air collecting compartment (13). 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the filter device (5) has a separate cover flap (8) with 

at least one water discharge opening each for each filter (6). 
A device according to either claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterised in that the filters (6) are each arranged in a housing (9) which 

at the same time serves to guide the purified fresh air within the filter device 
(5). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims
 
characterised in that guide ducts (12) are provided on the bulkhead (3) to 

guide the purified fresh air from the filter device (5) to the air collecting 
compartment (13). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims
 
characterised in that the inlets in the guide ducts (12) can be closed via  

 
swivel flaps (15) which are actuated via guide devices on the filter device 

(5).
