<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the temperature control of areas in buildings such as rooms 
in offices, hotels, retail shops, supermarkets, hospitals, and the like, 
by the cooling of rooms by transfer of heat from the air in the 
room by means of ceiling structure suspended below the top surface of the room. It is known to suspend a ceiling structure below the top surface of the room, the 
structure comprising panels incorporating pipes containing a fluid medium typically 
water. Heat is transferred from the hot air in the room into the pipes and extracted 
from the room, to keep the temperature in the room below a predetermined limit. 
GB-A-778317 discloses a heating panel formed of plastics and directly exposed to a 
room, the panel having canals through which flows a heating medium. The panels 
are attached by hooks to a ceiling. The panels may be corrugated or ribbed or 
otherwise shaped. GB-A-1497261 discloses a cooling panel comprising a 
composite panel through which cooling medium can flow. A sheet or membrane of 
material impervious to air and water and of low thermal resistance and low thermal 
capacity, is present on top of the panel. On the underside there is a covering of 
hydrophilic material which is exposed to the atmosphere and arranged to be wetted 
by condensed water without the formation of droplets thereon. The covering may 
be cotton fabric, blotting paper, generated cellulose, fibrous mats, gauze and 
muslin.  
 It is one object of this invention to provide a suspended cooling ceiling which is more 
efficient and advantageous in controlling the climate of a room, in particular to avoid 
condensation. According to the invention in one aspect there is provided a building including a 
room having a top surface, a cooling ceiling suspended by hanger means below the top 
surface, the ceiling comprising one or more panels formed of a plastics material and containing a fluid medium, the 
fluid medium being in contact with substantially all of the lower surface of the panels 
whereby heat transfer occurs over substantially all of the lower surface 
from the room (R) to the medium (W) and wherein 
a textured paint finish is present on the lower surface to increase 
surface area and avoid zones where there is such a temperature difference that 
condensation can occur. Preferably the lower surface of the panels is covered with a paint or the like to 
provide the textured finish. The panels are 
preferably moulded of polycarbonate, a PVC-u, ABS, high impact styrene 
or polymethylmethacrylate or

<CLAIMS>
A building including a room (R) having a top surface (T), a cooling ceiling (C) 
suspended by hanger means (1) below the top surface (T), the ceiling (C) 

comprising one or more panels (P) formed of a plastics material and containing a fluid medium (W), the fluid 
medium (W) being in contact with substantially all of the lower surface (10) of 

the panels (P) whereby heat transfer occurs over substantially all of the 
lower surface (10) from the room (R) to the medium (W) 

and wherein a textured paint finish is present on the 
lower surface (10) to increase surface area and avoid zones where there is 

such a temperature difference that condensation can occur. 
A building according to Claim 1, wherein the lower surface (10) of the panel 
(P) is contoured to increase the surface area thereof. 
A building according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the panel (P) is formed of a 
material having sufficient mechanical strength to support without distortion 

the weight of that panel (P) and the fluid medium (W) therein. 
A building according to any preceding Claim, wherein the panels (P) are 
received in a grid frame therefor formed by T-bars (2) to which the hanger 

means (1) are connected. 
A building according to any one to one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein hook means 
(20) are present on the panels (P1) and connected to the hanger means (1) 

whereby the panels (P1) are suspended directly from the hanger means (1).  
 
A building according to Claim 5, wherein adjacent panels (P1) are shaped 
(18,19) so that the lower surfaces (10) thereof present a substantially 

continuous surface. 
A building according to any preceding Claim, wherein the ceiling (C) 
constitutes the lower wall of a building services duct (6). 
A building according to Claim 7, including an inlet (3) for fresh air into the 
duct (6) and wherein the ceiling panels (P) are arranged to transfer heat with 

respect to the incoming air from the upper surface (11) of the panels (P). 
A method of cooling a room (R) in a building, the room (R) containing a 
ceiling (C) suspended by hanger means (1) below the top surface (T) of the 

room (R), the ceiling (C) being made of one or more panels (P) formed of a plastics material through 
which a fluid medium (W) is passed whereby the fluid 

medium (W) is contacted with substantially all of the lower surface (10) of the panels (P), and 
a textured paint finish is present on the lower surface (10) such that the 

surface area thereof is increased and there is substantially no temperature 
difference across the lower face so that condensation cannot occur. 
A method according to Claim 9, wherein the fluid medium is passed under a 
pressure of less than about 1 bar. 
A method according to Claim 10, wherein the fluid medium is passed at a 
pressure of about 0.2 bar. 
For use in a suspended cooling ceiling (C), a panel (P) formed of a plastics material 
and having means (13,14) for the flow of fluid medium (W) therethrough, the 

panel (P) being shaped so that, in use, the fluid medium (W) is in contact  
 

with substantially all of the lower surface (10) of the panel (P) 
and wherein a textured paint finish is present on the lower surface (10) to increase 

surface area and avoid zones where there is such a temperature difference 
that condensation can occur. 
A panel according to Claim 12, including hook means (20) for direct 
connection to hanger means (1).
