<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 2,4-di(alkylamino)-6-alkylthio-s-triazines
or of 2-alkylamino-4,6-dialkylthio-s-triazines, wherein
cyanuric chloride is reacted in three successive steps with two appropriate alkylamines and
an alkyl mercaptan, or in the alternative, with an appropriate alkylamine and two alkyl
mercaptans where the improvement involves the use of a single water-immiscible solvent and
a phase transfer catalyst in the mercaptan addition step.The preparation of substituted 2,4-diamino-6-alkylthio-s-triazines by successive
three-step addition processes to cyanuric chloride is known. Thus, similar three-step
processes are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,830,810; 3,766,182; and 3,753,986 in which,
in the first two successive reaction steps, cyanuric chloride is reacted with one primary amine
followed by reaction with a second primary amine in a solvent or diluent such as aliphatic
hydrocarbons, ketones, ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons, etc., and in the presence of an acid-binding
agent, with the first stage (i.e., addition of the first amine) being carried out at
temperatures below 30°C, preferably between -15°C and 0°C, and the second amination at
temperatures of between 0° and 45°C. The replacement of the last chlorine atom by the
alkylthio radical is performed by a process in which an aqueous base solution is added to the
suspension of the intermediate in a diluent (i.e., in acetone/water), and the mixture
subsequently stirred until a clear solution is formed. A double molar amount of alkyl
mercaptan is then introduced, the whole stirred at room temperature, and the desired product
isolated.Alternatively, said prior art references provide that exchange of the last chlorine for
the alkylthio radical can also be effected by the addition of the corresponding 6-chloro-s-triazine
derivative to an alcoholic or alcoholic/aqueous solution of an alkali metal mercaptide,
and the refluxing of the resulting mixture until it becomes neutral. The principal disadvantage of these known processes for the synthesis of 2,4-di(alkylamino)-6-alkylthio-s-triazines
is that the intermediate obtained after the second step
must be isolated and/or purified, e.g., by means of filtration or recrystallization, before being
reacted further if the final product is to be obtained in an acceptable yield. However, isolation
of the intermediate 2,4-diamino-6-chloro-s-triazine entails losses in yield, is economically
undesirable and time-consuming, and results in adverse environmental
