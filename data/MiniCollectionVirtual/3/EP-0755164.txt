<ABSTRACT>
A medium access control (MAC) layer protocol is used in a wireless ATM system
for integrated support of ATM services, including constant bit-rate (CBR),

variable bit-rate (VBR) and available bit-rate (ABR) services. The MAC protocol
supports both connectionless packet and connection-oriented virtual circuit

modes, with appropriate service parameter and quality-of-services selection. A
dynamic time division, multiple access/time division multiplex (TDMA/TDM)

approach accomodates the service classes in an integrated manner. A supervisory
MAC procedure integrates ATM ABR/VBR/CBR virtual circuits, providing

burst-by-burst allocation of ABR cells and call-by-call allocation of VBR and CBR
bandwidth parameters. A mechanism is provided for
 the dynamic allocation of
subframe capacities, assignment of ABR slots based on desired queueing rules,

assignment of VBR slots based on ATM traffic shaper parameters and assignment
of CBR slots based on bandwidth requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wireless ATM systems and specifically to a medium access control (MAC) layer protocol used in such systems for integrated support of ATM services, including constant bit-rate (CBR), variable bit-rate (VBR) and available bit-rate (ABR) services. The MAC protocol supports both connectionless packet and connection-oriented virtual circuit modes, with appropriate service parameter and quality-of-service (QoS) selection.Next-generation wireless personal communication networks will be required to co-exist with fiber-optic based broadband communication networks, which should become far more ubiquitous in the near future. These broadband systems (such as B-ISDN/ATM and ATM LAN) will offer constant bit-rate (CBR), variable bit-rate (VBR), available bit-rate (ABR) and packet transport services designed to support a range of voice, data, video, and multimedia applications. In order to avoid a serious mismatch between future wireline and wireless networks, it is necessary to consider broadband wireless systems with similar service capabilities. Personal communication networks introduced into the future multimedia application scenario should provide new service features such as high-speed transmission, flexible bandwidth allocation, VBR/CBR/packet modes, quality-of-service (QoS) selection, and so forth.The overall technical approach of the present invention is based on the recognition that ATM has recently emerged as the predominant switching and transport technology for wide and local area broadband networks to be deployed during the next several years. This means that it is desirable for the next-generation wireless personal communication network to provide similar ATM type service capabilities to the extent possible using radio medium. While certain quantitative limits on bit-rate or quality-of-service may have to be accepted for the wireless network, the availability of qualitatively equivalent service classes in a seamless manner would provide significant benefits of uniformity to network operators, service providers and terminal designers.There are several basic problems that must be addressed for the development of ATM-based broadband wireless networks, including:
1. High-speed radio transmission consistent with service requirements of future terminals. Typical video and multimedia services may require transmission bit-rates ~1-10 Mbps, a channel speed that is significantly higher than that being considered for first-generation wireless systems.2. Medium access control (MAC)
