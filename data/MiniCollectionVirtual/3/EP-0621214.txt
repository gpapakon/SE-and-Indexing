<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a handling device for containers having at least four corner units (1), each of which has an attachment rod (2), an extensible support foot (3), a wheel unit (4) on the support foot (3) and a spacer (5) between the support foot (3) and the attachment rod (2), the spacer (5) being arranged so as to be swivellable about the attachment rod (2) and at an invariable height relative to the upper part of the support foot (3). In order that the handling device can be handled simply with a maximum of two operators and does not engage on the front or rear end faces of the container but is still of such a light and simple construction that it can remain on the container during transportation of the container within the loading compartment, it is proposed that the telescopic support foot (3) comprises at least one hydraulic cylinder (6a, b), in each case at least two of the corner units (1) are in operative connection with one another via hydraulic lines (7), the oil container (9) and the hydraulic hand pump (10) are accommodated together in the same module, the hydraulic hand pump (10) has a ratchet (11) and a symmetrical polygon with at least six corners which protrudes from the spacer and onto which a transverse rod (12) can be fittd as an actuating lever (12), and one of the interconnected corner units (1) has a valve block (14) for setting the functions "lifting" and "lowering", distinguished in each case by the individual coupling possibilities.

a spacer (5) between the supporting foot (3) and the 
fastening rod (2), the spacer (5) being arranged so as 

to be pivotable about the fastening rod (2) and at an 
unchangeable height in relation to the top part of the 

supporting foot (3), 
the telescopic supporting foot (3) comprising at least 
one hydraulic cylinder (6), 
the oil tank (9) and the hydraulic hand pump (8) being 
accommodated together in the same module,
 
characterized in that 
in each case at least two of the corner units (1) are 
operatively connected to one another via hydraulic 

lines (7), 
the hydraulic hand pump (8) has a ratchet (11) and a 
symmetrical polygon (10) which protrudes out of the 

spacer (5) and has at least six corners, onto which 
polygon a transverse rod (12) can be fitted as an 

actuating lever, 
one of the coupled-together corner units (1) has a 
valve block for setting the functions "lifting" and 

"lowering", in each case differentiated by the individual 
coupling possibilities, and 
a drawbar (33) which can be fastened to the lower ends 
of two end-face corner units for manoeuvring the  

 
container. 
Handling device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, of the corner units (1) which can be 

coupled together, in each case only the corner unit 
having the valve block has a hydraulic hand pump (8) and 

an oil tank (9). 
Handling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the valve block is designed 

as a control shaft (13) which is configured to be 
parallel to the narrowest side of the spacer (5) and is 

connected securely against rotation to a selector disc 
(14) which is arranged on the outside of the broadside of 

the spacer (5) and can be fixed in any of the adjustable 
rotational positions. 
Handling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the supporting foot (3) has 

at least three segments (3a to 3c) which can be pushed 
one inside another and, inside the middle segment (3b), 

at least two hydraulic cylinders (6a, 6b) which are 
arranged adjacently in parallel, correspond to the length 

of the middle segment (3b), and eject their hydraulic 
pistons (15a, 15b) in opposite directions, namely towards 

the upper and lower segment (3a and 3b respectively). 
Handling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the hydraulic hand pump (8) 

and the oil tank (9) are arranged on the wheel unit (4). 
Handling device according to either of Claims 4 
or 5, characterized in that the hydraulic hand pump (8) 

and the oil tank (9) are arranged on the middle segment 
(3b), and the three segments (3a to 3c) can only move one 

inside another to the extent that the polygon (10) 
remains accessible for the hand pump (8). 
Handling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the wheel unit (5) comprises 

a rotary plate (17), opposite which there are 
mounted at least two wheels (16) arranged parallel to one 

another, and a guide shoe (18) which is mounted above the 
rotary plate (17) so as to be rotatable relative to the 

latter about a vertical axis and is open towards one  
 

side, and the lower extensible end of each supporting 
foot (3) comprises a rectangular insertion block (19) 

which fits into the guide shoe (18) and can be secured by 
means of an inserted pin (22). 
Handling device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a castor wheel trapezium
