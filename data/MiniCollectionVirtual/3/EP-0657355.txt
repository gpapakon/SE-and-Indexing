<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a tape binding device 
winding a tape piece having an adhesive surface on one side 

around an electric wire bundle to bundle it. In the device, a 
pair of arms (451,452) having a holding surface are lowered 

while holding the tape piece cut into a predetermined length on 
the holding surface. As it is lowered, free ends of both arms 

are lowered to both sides separated by a top portion of the 
electric wire bundle. At the time of lowering, after winding 

the tape piece by pressing it around the surface of the electric 
wire bundle, the free ends of both arms cause adhesive surfaces 

of both ends of the tape piece located under the electric wire 
bundle to be adhered to each other with the wire bundle clipped 

between them, thereby laminating the adhesive surfaces to each 
other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape binding
device used for bundling a plurality of electric wires in
the production process of wire harnesses, etc., and a tape
binding method.The production process of a wire harness consisting
of various kinds of insulated electric wires bundled together
includes an electric wire measuring/cutting step, a
peeling step for peeling an insulative sheath at the end of
the electric wire, a terminal crimping step for crimping a
terminal fitment at the end of the peeled electric wire, a
terminal insertion step for inserting a terminal into a
connector housing, and a subassembling step for assembling
electric wires to assemble wire harness subassemblies, etc.The production process has conventionally been
performed manually. Recently, however, mechanical devices
for automating the respective steps have been proposed, one
of which is an automated wire laying out device for
performing a part of the wire cutting step and subassembling
step.The automated wire laying out device is constructed in 
that a wire lay-out head for paying out electric wires moves
relatively to a wire lay-out board wherein a wire lay-out
pin is provided at a predetermined position according to a
predetermined program. That is, for example, the wire layout
head is moved parallel to the wire lay-out board and the
electric wires paid out are wound around the wire lay-out
pin at the time of moving, thereby laying out the electric
wire in the predetermined pattern.After wires are laid out, the end of the electric
wire is peeled and a desired terminal is crimped, and then
the terminal is inserted into a connector housing. In this
way, wire harness subassemblies constituting a portion of a
wire harness are produced. Similarly, various kinds of wire
harness subassemblies constituting the wire harness are
produced. The wire harness subassembly produced via laying
out of wires on the wire lay-out board is temporarily
removed from the wire laid-out board. Then, various kinds
of wire harness subassmeblies are further assembled in a
predetermined embodiment and then subjected to a main
assembling step to obtain a wire harness assembly as a
finished product.The wire harness subassembly is, for example,
composed of about 25 electric wires. Therefore, if the wire
harness subassembly is removed from the wire lay-out board,
the electric wires constituting the wire harness subassembly 
are taken to pieces. Thus, if the same kinds of wire
harness subassemblies are collected in one location,
electric wires constituting
