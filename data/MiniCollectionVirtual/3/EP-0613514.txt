<ABSTRACT>
A check valve for connection with the top end of a drillstring as a mud saver comprises a tubular valve member (18) which is axially shiftable within a tubular body (10) through a sleeve seal (19) which is mounted in the body (10) and which cooperates with ports in the wall of the tubular valve member (18) and which is disposed adjacent a downstream end of the tubular valve member. A compression spring (20) urges the tubular valve member (18) in the upstream direction into abutment with an upstream stop (15). The downstream end of the tubular valve member is closed by means of a frangible glass disc (21). The sleeve seal (19) is also axially shiftable in the body (10) in an upstream direction away from a downstream stop (17) and the compression spring (20) urges the sleeve seal (19) in the downstream direction. In a compact arrangement, the tubular valve member (18) is housed within an upstream hollow pin (30) of a saver sub particularly suited to a top drive arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a check valve for 
connection with the top end of a drillstring as a mud-saver. Mud-saver valves are installed at the lower end of a 
kelly for the purpose of checking outflow of drilling 
fluid from the kelly on disconnection of the kelly joint. 
Such mud-saver valves are also installed in a top drive 
system for the same purpose. A check valve construction is described in United 
States Patent Specification No. 3973587 (Cochran) and 
which is operative to permit a forward flow and, by means 
of a spring-loaded tubular member which is slidable 
through a tubular sleeve, to support an upstream column 
of fluid when the valve is closed, the strength of 
spring-loading determining the weight of fluid column 
which can be supported. However, this construction does 
not permit any reverse flow which, although of advantage 
in certain circumstances, is a disadvantage in the normal 
course of drilling by preventing release of pressure 
kicks whilst the drillstring is connected. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a check valve for connection with the top end of 
a drillstring as a mud saver, comprising a tubular valve 
member axially shiftable within a tubular body through a 
sleeve seal mounted in the body and which cooperates with 
ports in the wall of the tubular valve member which ports 
are disposed adjacent a downstream end of the tubular  
 
valve member, spring means urging the tubular valve 
member in the upstream direction and into abutment with a 
first stop means, and a closure closing the downstream 
end of the tubular valve member; characterised in that 
the sleeve seal is axially shiftable in the body in an 
upstream direction away from a second stop means, and in 
that the said spring means urges the sleeve seal in the 
downstream direction. Embodiments of the present invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings in which:- 
Fig. 1 is a sectional elevation of a first 
embodiment of a check valve in accordance with the 
present invention; and Fig. 2 is a sectional elevation similar to Fig. 1, 
but showing a second embodiment of a check valve in 
accordance with the present invention and connected with 
parts of a top drive and a drillstring. In Fig. 1 of the drawings, the check valve consists 
of a body 10 which is adapted for connecting in line 
coaxially with a kelly (not shown) and a drillstring (not 
shown). Thus, the check valve is inserted at the kelly 
joint which is the usual point of

(21, 2A) closing the downstream end of the tubular valve 
member (18); 
characterised in that
 the sleeve seal (19, 
19A) is axially shiftable in the body (10, 10A) in an 

upstream direction away from a second stop means (17), 
and in that the said spring means (20) urges the sleeve 

seal (19A) in the downstream direction.
