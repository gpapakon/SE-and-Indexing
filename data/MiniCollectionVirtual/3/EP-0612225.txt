<ABSTRACT>
An oven for frying food products in hot oil comprises a tank (1) in which the frying oil can be accommodated, a gas-fired heating device (9) connected to a heat exchanger (19) which is situated in the tank and through which the smoke gases flow, and also an outlet (30) for the smoke gases emerging from the heat exchanger. In order to avoid overheating of the oil near the heating device, a bypass pipe (34) connected to the outlet is provided for conveying at least a part of the outlet smoke gases back through the heat exchanger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an oven for frying food products in hot 
oil, comprising a tank in which the frying oil can be accommodated, a 
gas-fired heating device connected to a heat exchanger which is 
situated in the tank and through which the smoke gases flow, an outlet 
for the smoke gases emerging from the heat exchanger, and a bypass pipe 
connected to the outlet for conveying at least a part of the outlet 
smoke gases back through the heat exchanger. Such an oven is known from US-A-4898151. The heating device thereof 
is connected to a plenum which is not in direct heat exchange relationship 
with the oil in the tank. This known oven therefore has the 
disadvantage that the efficiency is not optimal. Moreover, the heating 
device itself may become too hot. The object of the invention is to provide an oven which does not 
have these disadvantages. This object is achieved in that the tank is 
provided below its nominal oil level with a first chamber into which 
both the bypass pipe and a flame tube, which is connected in a sealing 
manner to a gas burner, open out, which chamber is also connected to 
the heat exchanger.  
 The combustion gases have the highest temperature near the flame. The 
temperature of the chamber can also become exceedingly high in the region 
where the flame emerges from the flame tube. The result of this is that 
the oil can become overheated at that point. In order also to avoid this 
local overheating, the chamber is connected to a number of heat exchange 
pipes, and the flame tube has a number of outflow apertures for the 
combustion gases, each of which is aligned relative to a corresponding 
heat exchange pipe. The hot gases emerging from the outflow apertures of  
 
the flame tube now do not come into direct contact with the outer wall of 
the chamber. They are screened off to a certain extent while flowing into 
the heat exchange pipes by the cooler gas around the flame tube, and 
mixing of hot and cooler gas already occurs here. In order to ensure the desired guidance of the combustion gases and the 
heat exchange gases and the heat exchange pipes, the outflow apertures 
are formed by pipe sections which each project relative to the flame tube 
in the direction of a corresponding heat exchange pipe. Conveying the cooler gas along with the hot combustion gases outside the 
flame tube can be influenced beneficially if the heat exchange pipes each 
have a connecting piece which is connected to the chamber and has a 
decreasing cross-section from the flame tube onwards.

Oven for frying food products in hot oil, comprising a tank (1) in 
which the frying oil can be accommodated, a gas-fried heating device (9) 

connected to a heat exchanger (19, 24, 26) which is situated in the tank (1) and through 
which the smoke gases flow, an outlet (30) for the smoke gases 

emerging from the heat exchanger, and a bypass pipe (34) 
connected to the outlet (30) for conveying at least a part of the 

outlet smoke gases back through the heat exchanger, characterised in that 
the tank (1) is provided below 

its nominal oil level with a first chamber (11) into which both the bypass 
pipe (34) and a flame tube (12, 44), which is connected in a sealing manner to a gas
