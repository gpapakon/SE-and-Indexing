<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a system for administering epidural anesthesia 
utilizing an epidural 

catheter permanently secured at its proximal end (14) to an adapter 
(56) for putting the catheter 

in fluid communication with a source of liquid anesthesia. The system 
employs a 

splittable needle for inserting the catheter into the peridural space 
and a guide bar (27) for handling the needle during insertion. For 

removing, the needle will be gripped along its barrel or gently by the 
wings and inserted beneath the skin to the desired placement. After 

placement, the wings (22,24) may be flexed outwardly causing the needle 
to open up along the longitudinal slit (42), thereby causing splitting 

or cracking along the longitudinal groove (44) which in turn causes the 
needle halves following splitting to separate from the catheter (50) 

within the needle. 
 
This active mechanism protects the needle from undesired splitting 
away during insertion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-par of Applicant's earlier application, 
S.N. 08/076,921 filed May 7, 1993. Prior surgical procedures for administering epidural anesthesia utilize an epidural 
catheter having a free proximal end. Following introducing the catheter within the 
needle and then into the body, the needle is withdrawn from the body and slid over the 
free proximal end of the catheter. The proximal end of the catheter is then secured to 
a catheter connector or adapter for placement in fluid communication with a source of 
the liquid anesthesia for administering to the patient. To guard against overtightening of the catheter connector, causing damage to the 
catheter and/or its function, or undertightening or accidental loosening whereby the 
catheter slips out of the connector, as well as the problem which sometimes occurs of 
accidentally dropping the connector while attempting to secure it to the catheter, it 
would be desirable to employ an epidural catheter pre-connected at its proximal end 
to an adapter. However, if this is done, it will be appreciated that it would no longer be possible 
to slide the needle through which the catheter is introduced over the proximal end of 
the catheter following introduction into the peridural space for administration of the 
epidural anesthesia.  Stated simply, the task of this invention is to provide an efficient and cost-effective 
system for administering epidural anesthesia utilizing an epidural catheter 
permanently secured at its proximal end to a connector or adapter for placing the 
catheter in fluid communication with a source of liquid anesthesia. In accordance with this invention the task is solved in an elegant manner by 
providing a system for administering epidural anesthesia utilizing an epidural catheter 
permanently secured at its proximal end to an adapter for placing the catheter in fluid 
communication with a source of liquid anesthesia in combination with a splittable 
needle to be described in detail hereinafter and which can be readily split apart for 
separation from the catheter following introduction of the catheter through the needle 
into the peridural space. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the novel system for administering epidural 
anesthesia of this invention; Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a split needle useful in the practice of this 
invention; Fig. 3 is a perspective view partially broken away showing the epidural catheter 
secured to an adapter at its proximal end;  Fig. 4 is a top plan view of the device

<CLAIMS>
A splittable needle device through which a catheter may be introduced into 
the peridural space of a patient for administering epidural anesthesia from a source of the 

anesthesia, comprising; 

(a) an epidural needle having a barrel portion with inner and outer walls 
and opposed distal and proximal ends, the needle being splittable from its distal to its 

proximal end, whereby to be separable from the catheter inserted therewithin upon splitting; 
(b) a hub assembly secured around the proximal end of the needle; 
(c) means for splitting the needle and the hub assembly to separate the 
device from the catheter; and 
(d) guide means separate from the splitting means for gripping to facilitate 
insertion of the needle without touching the splitting means which can cause inadvertent 

premature splitting of the needle. 
A splittable needle device as defined in Claim 1 wherein the splitting means 
includes flexing wings secured to the needle and to the hub assembly so as to cause splitting 

of each of the needle and the hub assembly upon flexing of the wings. 
A splittable needle device as defined in Claim 2 wherein the guide means 
consists of a guide bar seated on and secured to the flexing wings, the guide bar having two 

substantially equal longitudinal sections, each having upper and lower longitudinal surfaces, 
the two sections being separated at their upper surface by a slit, the slit extending 

substantially through the guide bar to the lower surface of the guide bar. 
A splittable needle device as defined in Claim 3 wherein the hub assembly 
as distal and proximal ends and a pair of slits extending between the distal and trailing ends 

of the hub assembly, the slits being essentially parallel and being situated radially 
approximately 180째 apart to facilitate splitting of the hub assembly from its distal to its 

proximal end upon flexing the wings secured to the hub assembly. 
A splittable needle device as defined in Claim 4 wherein the needle has a 
longitudinal slit extending the entire length of the needle barrel between the ends of the 

needle, the needle having a groove on the inner wall of the barrel also extending 
longitudinally between the ends of the needle, the groove being situated approximately 180째 

radially from the slit in the needle barrel and being parallel thereto, the groove depth being 
sufficiently shallow to ensure adequate stiffness during use while being deep enough so that 

the needle will split easily when the wings are flexed, thereby concurrently separating both 
the hub assembly and the needle from the catheter within the splittable needle. 
A splittable needle device as defined in Claim 5 wherein the proximal end of 
the hub assembly has a luer fitting for receiving the leading end of a syringe. 
A splittable needle device through which a catheter may be introduced into 
the peridural space of a patient for administering epidural anesthesia from a source of the 

anesthesia comprising; 

(a) an epidural needle splittable longitudinally and having opposed distal 
and proximal ends and a barrel portion with inner and outer walls extending between the 

 
opposed ends of the needle; 
(b) a hub assembly secured around the proximal end of the needle, the 
hub assembly having a pair of slits extending between the ends of the hub assembly, the slits 

being essentially parallel and being situated radially approximately 180째 apart; 
(c) flexing wings secured to the needle and to the hub assembly so as to 
cause splitting of each of the splittable needle and the hub assembly upon flexing of the 

wings so that the needle device can be separated from a catheter inserted therein for 
administering the epidural anesthesia; and 
(d) a guide bar for gripping to facilitate insertion of the needle without 
contacting the flexing wings, which contacting can cause inadvertent premature splitting of 

the needle. 
A splittable needle device as defined in Claim 7 wherein the guide bar has 
upper and lower longitudinal surfaces and is seated on and secured to the flexing wings. 
A splittable needle device as defined in Claim 8 wherein the guide bar has 
substantially equal longitudinal sections separated at their upper surface by a slit, the slit 

extending substantially through the guide bar to its lower surface.

longitudinal slit extending the entire length of the needle barrel between the ends of the 

needle, the needle having a groove on the inner wall of the barrel also extending 
longitudinally between the ends of the needle, the groove being situated approximately 180째 

radially from the slit in the needle barrel and being parallel thereto, the groove depth being 
sufficiently shallow to ensure adequate stiffness during use while being deep enough so that 

 
the needle will split easily when the wings are flexed, thereby concurrently separating both 

the hub assembly and the needle from the catheter within the splittable needle. 
A splittable needle device as defined in Claim 10 wherein the proximal end 
of the hub assembly has a luer fitting for receiving the leading end of a syringe. 
A method for administering epidural anesthesia comprising the steps of:
