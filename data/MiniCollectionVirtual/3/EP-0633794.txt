<ABSTRACT>
A filtering device for connection to the respiratory tract of a person and comprising a cover (1) enclosing a heat and moisture exchanging material and a bacteria absorbing filter which consists of a folded, air-permeable sheet material. The heat and moisture exchanging material is formed as strips (9) inserted in the pleats of the sheet material (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filtering device
for connection to the respiratory tract of a person and
comprising a cover enclosing a heat and moisture exchanging
material and a bacteria-absorbing filter which consists of a
folded, air-permeable sheet material. The invention also
relates to the use of such a filtering device.The filtering device according to the invention may
be used in connection with respirator care, intensive care
and anaesthesia of patients.Patients receiving respirator care are of ten
susceptible to infection. For this reason, it is important
to filter the air coming from the respirator from foreign
bacteria, virus, etc.The air coming from the patient is often infected
and/or moist. Said air enters the respirator during exhalation,
and bacteria and other particles are deposited inside
it together with warm and moist condensate. This results in
rapid growth of microorganisms and it is therefore necessary
to clean and sterilize the respirator at regular intervals
and, as a rule, between patients.For this reason it is important to protect the
respirator from the air coming from the patient.
US-A 3 713 440 and US-A 4 063 913 disclose and show examples
of filters solving this problem.As a rule, a so called active humidifier moistens
the air of a patient connected to a respirator. This is
because the air coming from the respirator is dry and has a
relatively low temperature which would make the lungs dry
up, if the air was not humidified before it is introduced
into the patient.An active humidifier is usually rather expensive
and requires supervision, refilling of water, and maintenance 
in order to work in a satisfactory way. The air
coming from the humidifier will be condensed into the tubing
system, which therefore has to be emptied regularly, and the
condensate constitutes a breeding ground for microorganisms.
For this reason, heat and moisture exchangers (HME)
positioned between the patient and the respirator are often
used.Said heat and moisture exchangers operate in such a
way that the moisture of the air exhaled by the patient is
accumulated and stored in an air-permeable material and
thereafter partly evaporates during inhalation and is
returned to the patient in the air inhaled.Examples of such heat and moisture exchangers are
disclosed and shown in SE-C 167 364, US-A 4 090 513,
US-A 4 200 094 and GB 2 116 434A.Said devices have many advantages. They are
nonexpensive to manufacture and use, provide excellent
humidification as well as dry tubes. However, their bacteria
