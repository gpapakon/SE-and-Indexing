<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shaft assembly for a
tool, in particular to a shaft assembly for a vegetation
cutter, in particular a vegetation cutter that cuts by means
of a filament or strip that is rotated rapidly about an axis
that may be either substantially vertical or substantially
horizontal, depending upon the application.Vegetation cutters of this type are known, in which the
cutting head can be rotated between a trimming mode, in
which the filament or strip is rotated about a substantially
vertical axis, and an edging mode in which the filament or
strip is rotated about a substantially horizontal axis. It
is a disadvantage of these known trimmers that the effective
shaft length, that is the length between the handle and the
working head, remains substantially the same whichever mode
is used, and cannot be adjusted for individual operators of
different heights.It is also known to provide vegetation cutters of the
type which cut by means of a filament or strip which is
rotated about a substantially vertical axis, with a handle
the length of which can be adjusted for different operators.
The length adjustment however is by means of a complicated
arrangement and is primarily intended for initial adjustment
to a length which is satisfactory for an individual
purchaser or operator.US-A-4,052,789 discloses a line trimmer which comprises a
handle attached to a cutting head via a shaft. The shaft
comprises attitude adjusting means which connects a top part
of the shaft to a bottom part of the shaft and which enables
the user to rotate the cutting head about the longitudinal
axis of the shaft in relation to the handle. The cutting
head is rotated by a user applying a compressional force to
the shaft to unlock the attitude adjusting means which is 
biased into a locking position. The attitude adjusting
means is unlocked by the axial movement of the top part of
the shaft relative to the bottom part of the shaft. This
enables the top part of the shaft to rotate freely relative
to the bottom part, and therefore the user can rotate the
top part, and hence the handle, relative to the bottom part,
and hence the cutting head, to a preset desired position.
The user then removes the compressional force allowing the
biasing force to lock the attitude adjusting means. Thus,
the angular position of the top part of the shaft is fixed
relative to the bottom part and rotational movement between
the two is prevented. However, the attitude adjusting means
disclosed in US-A-4,052,789 only enables the handle to be
loca

<CLAIMS>
A shaft assembly (14) for a tool, said assembly (14)
being adapted to be arranged between a handle (16) and a

working head (12) of the tool, and comprising a first
shaft part (26) and a second shaft part (28), characterised

in that:

pin means (62) is trapped within the first shaft part

(26) and is adapted to engage with co-operating receiving
means (50, 52) in the second shaft part (28) to enable the

first shaft part (26) to be slideable and rotatable within
the second shaft part (28) between different clamped

positions; and
clamp means (78) is provided to secure the second shaft
part (28) relative to the first shaft part (26).
A shaft assembly (14) according to Claim 1
characterised in that the first shaft part (26) comprises

first (34) and second (36) mating parts.
A shaft assembly (14) according to Claim 2
characterised in that the pin means (62) is retained within

the first shaft part (26) and is free to move between a
first location in the first shaft part (24) corresponding to

maximum extension of the shaft (14) and a second location in
the first shaft part (26) corresponding to minimum extension

of the shaft (14).
A shaft assembly (14) according to Claim 3
characterised in that a longitudinal channel (38, 40)

extends along a portion of the length of each of the mating
parts (34, 36) of the first shaft part (26), and the pin

means (62) is mounted within the assembled first shaft part
(26) so that one end (64) of the pin means projects through

the channel (38) in the first mating part (34) of the first 
shaft part (26), and the other end (66) projects through the

channel (40) in the second mating part (36) of the first
shaft part, (26).
A shaft assembly according to any of Claims 1 to 4
characterised in the second shaft part (28) comprises first

(46) and second (48) mating parts.
A shaft assembly according to Claim 5 characterised in
that the co-operating receiving means (50, 52) comprise a

corresponding radial groove is formed in the inside wall of
each of the two mating parts (46, 48) of the second shaft

part (28).
A shaft assembly according to Claim 6 characterised in
that the radial grooves (50, 52) formed in the inside walls

of the second shaft part (26) are sized to engage the
projecting ends (64, 66) of the pin means (62).
A shaft assembly according to either of Claims 6 or 7
characterised in that each radial groove (50, 52) is

provided with a stop to limit movement of the pin means and
hence limit rotation of the first shaft part.
A shaft assembly according to any of Claims 1 to 8
characterised in that the end of the second shaft part (28),

into which the first shaft part (26) is inserted, terminates
in a plurality of deformable fingers (44, 44', 44'', 44'''),

and a locking ring (78) is provided to clamp the fingers
(44, 44', 44'', 44''') in engagement with the first shaft

part (26).
A shaft assembly according to Claim 9, characterised in
that the second shaft part (28) terminates in four

deformable fingers (44, 44', 44'', 44''') and the locking
ring is free to rotate between a disengaged and an engaged

position. 
A vegetation cutter comprising a handle (16), a cutting
head (12), and

a shaft assembly (14) as claimed in any of claims 1 to 10.
