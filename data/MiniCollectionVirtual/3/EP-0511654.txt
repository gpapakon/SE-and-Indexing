<ABSTRACT>
A drive apparatus, for a hybrid vehicle equipped with an engine (1) and a motor (6), heats 
the engine (1) or a catalytic converter (9) using the regenerated electricity of the motor (6). As the temperature of the 

engine (1) or the catalyst thus rises, air polluting components in an exhaust gas discharged via the motor (6) or the 
catalytic converter (9) are reduced. Typical air polluting components are NC, NOx and CO.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drive apparatus for a 
hybrid vehicle having an engine and a driving motor, and 
more particularly to the treatment of exhaust gas 
produced when the engine is activated. In recent years, for the purposes of air 
environment protection and noise reduction, a so-called 
electric vehicle equipped with an electric motor as a 
drive source has commanded a lot of attention. However, 
a battery to power the electric motor has only a 
limited capacity so that the electric vehicle can travel 
only a limited distance on one battery charging, compared 
to gasoline vehicles. Further, unlike filling up with 
gasoline, it takes a long time to charge up the battery 
of the electric vehicle so that it is impossible to 
increase uninterrupted mileage to a considerable extent. To this end, a hybrid vehicle has been proposed 
which suppresses the exhaust gas and noise problems of 
the conventional gasoline vehicles and complements the  
 
disadvantage of the electric vehicles. In this hybrid 
vehicle, a generator is activated by the engine to supply 
electricity to a motor for driving the vehicle and also 
to accumulate electricity in a battery. In the hybrid 
vehicle, like the conventional electric vehicle, the 
battery can supply electricity to the motor for driving 
the vehicle. Further, since variance in output torque 
can be damped by the battery, it is possible to operate 
the engine in a constant condition, irrespective of the 
travelling conditions of the vehicle. It is therefore 
possible to operate the engine so as to cause less noise 
and less noxious substances to be contained in the 
exhaust gas. FIG. 5 of the accompanying drawings shows, of the 
prior hybrid vehicles, a so-called series hybrid vehicle. 
The series hybrid vehicle comprises an engine 1 to be 
driven by fuel such as gasoline, a generator 2 to be 
activated by the engine 1 to generate d.c. electricity, a 
battery 3 for accumulating the electricity generated by 
the generator 2, an inverter 4 for converting the d.c. 
electricity from the generator 2 and the battery 3 into a 
needed value of a.c. electricity, an induction motor 6 to 
be activated by the a.c. electricity from the inverter 4,  
 
and a transmission or gearbox 7 for transmitting the 
driving force of the motor 6 to tires 8. During power running, fuel such as gasoline is 
supplied to the engine 1 for rotation at a predetermined 
r.p.m. The torque of the engine 1 is transmitted to the 
generator 2 for conversion into d.c. electricity. Of the 
thus obtained
