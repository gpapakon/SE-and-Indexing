<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 
task completion confirmation system for vehicles which allows 

crew members to carry out their tasks correctly by 
automatically displaying the tasks which have been completed. 

A garbage truck (10) goes to a plurality of garbage collecting 
areas (20) to collect garbage. When the garbage truck (10) comes near 

or reaches the garbage collecting area (20), a communication 
device (40) is capable of communicating with a response device (50) in 

a display plate (21). It writes into a storage circuit (33) data 
indicating garbage collecting points (20), progress of task, and 

the like, based on the communication. Accordingly, the crew 
members are able to collect garbage at each of the garbage 

collecting areas (20), without making any mistakes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a task completion 
confirmation system for various vehicles such as shuttle 
buses, garbage trucks, and mail trucks which go from place to 
place to predetermined places to perform predetermined tasks, 
which system is excellent in confirming the places the 
vehicles have stopped by or, in other words, the tasks which 
have been completed thereby. Hitherto, various vehicles such as shuttle buses, 
garbage trucks, and mail trucks which go from place to place 
to predetermined places to perform predetermined tasks have 
not been equipped with a device which allows automatic 
confirmation of the places the vehicles have gone to, so that 
such confirmation depended on memory, judgement, or written 
notes of crew members. Accordingly, if a crew member remembered incorrectly 
or misjudged or forgot to write down the places the vehicle 
has gone to, the shuttle bus would take the wrong route, and 
the garbage truck and the mail truck would not stop at a 
predetermined place for garbage collection, and mail 
collection, respectively.  
 Document WO-A-92/16907, on which the preamble of claim 
1 is based, discloses a tracking system wherein the location 
of the vehicle is detected by means of LORAN systems 
or Global Positioning Systems. Moreover, it includes an operating 
means within the vehicle which may be operated by 
the crew members to confirm predetermined tasks when the 
vehicle is at a specific place. Document EP-A-0249487 discloses a vehicle position recognizing 
means comprising location point devices installed 
to respectively a plurality of different places. Communication 
means which communicate by radio with each of the location 
point devices are provided to allow a processing 
unit to identify the respective working area of the vehicle. 
Moreover, a digital display unit is connected to the 
processing unit within the vehicle which provides the crew 
members with non-permanent data information. Finally, document EP-A-0501058 discloses a display located 
in a vehicle in order to display on a map the current 
location of the vehicle to the driver. However, none of the cited prior art documents discloses 
a task completion confirmation system improving the 
survey of the tasks to be carried out and which have been 
already completed. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a task completion confirmation system for vehicles 
which helps the crew members to carry out their tasks correctly 
by informing them the tasks which have been already 
compl
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A task completion confirmation system for a vehicle which 
goes from place to place to a plurality of places, said system being arranged to confirm 

the tasks which have been completed, thereby allowing crew 
members to carry out predetermined tasks at said plurality 

of places, said system comprising: 

an operating means (34) which may be operated by said 
crew members to confirm said predetermined tasks, when said 

vehicle (10) is at any one of said plurality of places; and 
vehicle position recognizing means (32, 33, 40, 50) 
which recognize whether said vehicle (10) is at said one of 

said plurality of places by generating a signal for identifying 
said one of said plurality of places as a particular 

place; characterized by 
a display means (35), provided in said vehicle, for 
displaying said plurality of places; and 
a control means (32) which causes said display means 
to display, differently, the plurality of places said vehicle 

(10) has gone to and has not yet gone to, in accordance 
with said signal from said vehicle position recognizing 

means (32, 33, 40, 50), when said operating means (34) has 
been operated; 
wherein said vehicle position recognizing means (32, 
33, 40, 50) comprises: 
location point devices (50) installed respectively at 
said plurality of places; 
communication means (40) which communicates by radio 
with each of said location point devices (50) installed at 

said plurality of places; and 
storage means (33) which stores data indicating said 
plurality of places; 
wherein said vehicle (10) is recognized to be at said 
particular place among said plurality of places based on 

the communication of said communication means (40) and the 
stored data of said storage means (33). 
A task completion confirmation system for vehicles according 
to claim 1, characterized in that said storage 

means comprises: 

an IC card (38) which stores data indicating said plurality 
of places; and 
an IC card reader/writer (37) capable of reading out 
and writing data stored in said IC card (38). 
A task completion confirmation system for vehicles according 
to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized by an arrival 

recognition means which allows said crew members to 
recognize that their vehicle has reached the particular 

place, when said vehicle position recognition means (32, 
33, 40, 50) has recognized that said vehicle (10) has 

reached one of said plurality of places.
