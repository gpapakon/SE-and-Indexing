<ABSTRACT>
A container, for example a container for dog 
waste, is pivotally mounted in a cover 12 which 

surrounds the rear sides and top of the container 10 for 
movement between an in use position in which it can 

receive waste through an aperture 39 in the top of the 
cover to an unloading position in which a bag 24 lining 

the container can be fitted or removed. The top rim 18 
of the container has two pairs of slots 20 in opposite 

edges thereof to receive parts of the handles 22 of the 
bag 24 with the handles retained outside of the 

container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns improvements in or 
relating to containers, particularly but not exclusively 
containers for dog waste. To facilitate the disposal of rubbish from 
containers, for example domestic containers, rubbish 
containers located in public places and containers for 
dog waste, plastic bags are used to line the containers, 
the bags facilitating the emptying of the container and 
the onward transport of the emptied rubbish. Particular 
problems may occur where the contents of the bag are 
unpleasant, for example, dog waste. Many existing rubbish containers utilise plain 
plastics rubbish bags which are often known as black bin 
liners. The bag is placed in the container and its 
upper open edge draped around the exterior of the 
container top. This method presents a number of 
difficulties, for example the bag may not be securely 
located if its periphery around its open top is much 
greater in size than the periphery of the opening to the 
container or, conversely, if it is close to the size of 
the periphery of the container fitment is difficult. 
Additionally, it is desirable that the bottom of the bag 
lies in close proximity with the bottom of the container 
so that heavy loads are supported by the bottom of the  
 
container rather than the bottom of the bag. A further 
disadvantage of this existing arrangement is that the 
portion of the bag outside the container can be 
unsightly. This method of mounting the bag sometimes 
results in the opening to the bag being partially or 
fully closed by virtue of the lower regions of the bag 
remaining "stuck" to each other. Furthermore, if the 
bag is not carefully filled the portion overlying the 
top of the container, that is the portion which will be 
handled when the bag is removed from the container, can 
be contaminated. A further type of existing bag used to line 
containers is known as a "bunny" bag. These bags are 
provided with two handle formations at their upper end, 
the handles being used to carry a filled bag and also, 
if necessary, to tie off the top of a filled bag. Bunny 
bags are used in a manner similar to normal bin liners, 
that is the area surrounding the upper opening is draped 
around the top of the container. This arrangement of 
mounting the bag is disadvantageous for the reaons 
described in the preceding paragraph. It is an object of the present invention to 
obviate or mitigate these and other disadvantages. According to the present invention there is  
 
provided a container adapted to receive a lining
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container adapted to receive a lining bag, the 
container having an open top defined by a top rim 

portion, characterised in that said rim portion is 
provided with two opposed pairs of downwardly extending 

slots (20) adapted to receive sections (22) of the 
lining bag (24) whereby portions of the lining bag (22) 

can lie outside the container (10) between the slots 
(20). 
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that opposed sides of the container are each provided 

with a pair of slots (20) and in that the rim portion 
(18) of the container (10) in the region of and between 

the slots is recesssed (26). 
A container as claimed in claim (2), characterised 
in that a member (21) projects partially across the open 

top of each slot (20), the member being a resilient 
member fixed to the top rim portion (18). 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that it is provided with a cover (12) 

to enclose its open top, the cover having an aperture 
(39) therethrough with a flap arrangment (42) located in 

the aperture to provide a platform (46) for receiving 
 

articles to be deposited in the container (10) when the 
arrangement (42) is in its open position and deposit 

them in the container when the arrangement is in its 
closed postion. 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the container (10) is pivotally 

mounted relative to the cover (12) which is provided 
with mounting means whereby it can be attached to a 

wall, mounting post (16) or any other suitable support 
member and in addition to including a top portion (30) 

extending across the top of the container (10) in the 
closed position, has sides (34) and a rear portion (32) 

extending down the rear and sides of the container. 
A container as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a resilient sealing gasket 

(50) is provided in the under face (48) of the cover 
(12) against which the upper rim (31) of the container 

(10) can abut the seal when the container is in its 
closed position. 
A container as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the portions (32),(34) of 

the cover (12) extending over the rear and sides of the 
container (10) supports a container mounting bar (40) on 

which the rear lower edge of the container (10) is 
 

removably pivotally supported, said rear lower edge of 
the container includes a downwardly opening channel (38) 

whereby the container (10) is removable by lifting it 
away from the bar (40) such that the channel (38) 

disengages the bar. 
A container as claimed in claim 7, characterised 
in that means are provided for limiting the pivotal 

movement of the container (10) relative to the bar (40) 
said means comprising a rear stop (26),(62) to prevent 

pivotal movement of the container (10) in a rearwards 
direction beyond the position w
here the top (18) of the 
container is not in registry with the aperture (39) in 

the cover and a forward stop comprsing an abutment 
surface (60) projecting from the rim portion (18) of the 

container (10) and engageable with a corresponding 
abutment surface (62) towards the front of the cover 

(12) against which the container abutment surface (60) 
contacts when the container is pivoted forwardly about 

the pivot bar (40) to a container unloading position 
where substantially the entire open top of the container 

is exposed. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 
8, characterised in that the container (10) and cover 

(12) are manufactured from plastics material. 
A container as claimed in any one of the claims 1 
to 9 when mounted on a post (16) , is characterised in 

that when the container is mounted on a post, pedal 
operated linkage is provided to move the flap arrangment 

(42) between its open and closed positions.
