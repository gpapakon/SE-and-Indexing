<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides intermediates for compounds
which are antagonists of excitatory amino acid receptors.A variety of physiologic functions have been
shown to be subject to influence by excessive stimulation
of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission.
Compounds which have the ability to block excitatory
amino acid receptors have the ability to treat a variety
of disorders in mammals which include neurological
disorders such as convulsive disorders for example,
epilepsy; stroke; anxiety; cerebral ischaemia; muscular
spasms; and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's
Disease and Huntington's Disease.The present invention relates to intermediates for
compounds of the formula
 
wherein:
X is -COOH,

-SO2R3, -PO3(R4)2 or

one of Y and Z is
-COOH,

or

and the other of Y and Z is hydrogen;each R3 is independently C1-C16 alkoxy,
phenyl-substituted C1-C4 alkoxy, or an oral ester
forming group;each R4 is independently hydrogen, C1-C16
alkyl, phenyl-substituted C1-C4 alkyl, or phenyl; ora pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.In the above formula, the term "C1-C16 alkyl"
represents a straight or branched alkyl chain having
from one to sixteen carbon atoms. Typical C1-C16 alkyl
groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, 
n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl,
isopentyl, n-hexyl, 2-methylpentyl, n-octyl, decyl,
undecyl, hexadecyl, and the like. The term "C1-C16
alkyl" includes within it the terms "C1-C6 alkyl" and
"C1-C4 alkyl". The term "C1-C16 alkoxy" can be represented
by (C1-C16 alkyl)-O- and includes within it
the term "C1-C4 alkoxy".The term "phenyl-substituted C1-C4 alkyl"
represents a C1-C4 alkyl group bearing a phenyl group,
such as benzyl, 1-phenylethyl, 2-phenylethyl, 3-phenylpropyl,
4-phenylbutyl, 2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl, and the
like.The term "oral ester forming group," as used
herein, represents a substituent which, when attached
to the carboxylic acid group, forms an ester function
suitable for administration to mammals in need of
treatment. Examples of such oral ester forming groups
include C1-C4 alkoxy; benzyloxy; benzyloxy substituted
on the phenyl ring with halogen, C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4
alkoxy; C1-C5 alkanoyloxymethyl; or C1-C5 alkanoyloxymethyl
substituted on the oxomethyl with C1-C4 alkyl
or C4-C7 cycloalkyl.While all the above compounds are believed to be
antagonists of excitatory amino acid receptors, there are
certain compounds which are preferred for such use. Preferably,
the ring juncture is cis, Y is -COOH, Z is hydrogen,
and X is -COOH,
