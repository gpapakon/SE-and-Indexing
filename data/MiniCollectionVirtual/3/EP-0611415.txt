<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
monitoring the efficiency of a catalytic converter for 
treating exhaust gases from an internal combustion engine 
equipped with a device for regulating the engine inlet 
air/fuel mixture and with at least one fuel injector 
whose opening time is controlled by this device. Today motor vehicles propelled by an internal 
combustion engine are currently equipped with a device 
for regulating the composition of the engine inlet 
air/fuel mixture and with a catalytic converter arranged 
in the pipe of the exhaust gases of the engine in order 
to reduce or oxidise certain components of the latter 
into less noxious chemical species. The catalytic converter 
is said to be "three-way" when it oxidises carbon 
monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons as well as reducing 
nitrogen oxides, produced by the combustion of the 
air/fuel mixture. To this end, the converter comprises, 
on a matrix made, for example, from ceramic, shaped in 
such a manner as to establish a maximum exchange surface 
with the exhaust gases, a coating comprising an oxidation 
catalyst metal such as platinum for example, a reduction 
catalyst metal such as rhodium for example and an oxygen 
storage metal such as cerium. This coating degrades with time under the effect 
of "poisons" or attack such as for example the combustion 
of unburnt hydrocarbons in the catalytic converter 
following engine misfires. The active surface of the 
coating thus diminishes thereby lowering the overall 
efficiency of the catalytic converter. Increasingly stricter anti-pollution standards 
now stipulate that motor vehicles are to be equipped with 
installed means for permanently monitoring the efficiency 
of the catalytic converter, so that degradation of this 
efficiency is detectable and so that a remedy is sought 
before this efficiency drops below a minimum admissible  
 
level. Measuring the efficiency of a catalytic converter 
by its ability to store oxygen is known. In fact, it has 
been observed that the degradation of the oxygen-storage 
metal follows that of the other metals used in the 
catalytic converter. In order to measure the capacity of 
the converter to store oxygen, it has been proposed to 
arrange an oxygen probe downstream of the converter and 
to determine, from the signal supplied by this probe, the 
capacity of the converter to "smooth" the fluctuations in 
the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gases by 
absorption/resorption of oxygen. To this end a method is known from the document

Method for monitoring the efficiency of a catalytic 
converter for treating exhaust gases from an internal 

combustion engine equipped with a device for regulating 
the engine inlet air/fuel mixture and with at least one 

fuel injector whose opening time is controlled by this 
device, according to which: 


a) an oxygen probe (13) whose output signal 
switches between two levels, is arranged in the gas flow 

leaving the catalytic converter (11), 
b) during regulation and at a stabilised speed, 
the injector opening time suitable for ensuring 

stoichiometry of the air/fuel mixture is measured, 
c) next, during a predetermined time interval 
(Δt) a time variation of symmetric deviation whose 

amplitude and shape is predetermined about a base injection 
time chosen from the injection time determined in 

step b) is imposed on the opening time, 
d) the base opening time used during successive 
time intervals (Δt₁, Δt₂, Δt₃) is modified progressively 

and in a monotonic manner so as to pass through a 
centring of the deviation of the opening time on that of 

the oxygen storage capacity of the catalytic converter, 
and, 
e) from the possible appearance of an oscillation 
of this signal, an evaluation of the efficiency of the 

catalyst is drawn. 
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised 
in that the deviation and the frequency of the time 

variation of the opening time are fixed at values corresponding 
to a minimum acceptable oxygen absorption capacity 

of the catalytic converter and insufficient capacity 
of the catalytic converter is diagnosed in the event of 

an oscillation appearing in the output signal of the 
oxygen probe during the progressive modification of the 

base opening time. 
Method in accordance with Claim 2, characterised 
in that a converter in a correct operational state is 

diagnosed in the event of a single switching of the  
 

output signal (S₂) of the oxygen probe appearing during 
the progressive modification of the base injection time. 
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised 
in that the amplitude and the frequency of the time 

variation of the opening time are fixed at a value lower 
than that which corresponds to the minimum acceptable 

oxygen absorption capacity of the catalytic converter, 
the base opening time is progressively modified in a 

direction suitable for unblocking the output signal of 
the probe (13) and, from the variation thus observed of 

the base opening time to cause the output signal of the 
probe (13) to pass from a blocking at one of the levels 

to a blocking at the other level, a value is drawn for 
this base opening time suitable for centring the 

deviation of the quantity of oxygen stored which is 
engendered by the controlled deviation of
 the opening 
time, on the mean value of the quantity of oxygen which 

can be stored in the converter, and the base opening time 
is then fixed at the value thus calculated. 
Method in accordance with Claim 4, characterised 
in that the period of the time variation of the opening 

time is fixed about the fixed base time, the amplitude of 
this variation is constantly made to increase and a 

measure of the efficiency of the catalytic converter is 
deduced from the amplitude attained by this variation at 

the instant where the output signal of the probe starts 
to oscillate. 
Method in accordance with Claim 4, characterised 
in that the amplitude of the time variation of the 

opening time is fixed about the fixed base time, the 
period of this variation is made to increase and a 

measure of the efficiency of the catalytic converter is 
deduced from the value attained by this period at the 

instant where the output signal of the probe starts to 
oscillate.
