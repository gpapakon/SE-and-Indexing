<ABSTRACT>
A method of removing a valuable protein from a 
complex solution and recovering the valuable protein in 

purified form consists of adding a silica gel sorbant 
having a pore size approximately the molecular size of 

the protein to a solution containing the protein, 
allowing the protein to be sorbed onto the sorbant, 

separating the sorbant from the solution and then 
recovering the protein from the sorbant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of protein 
purification. More particularly, it relates to a method 
by which valuable proteins in complex solutions, such as 
fermentation broths and milk, can be removed and 
recovered in a purified form. Advances in biotechnology have made it possible to 
take a gene sequence which is responsible for the expression 
of a valuable protein in one organism, such as the 
human gene for insulin, and introduce it into another 
organism which expresses the valuable protein, for 
example into a fermentation broth or milk. 
Unfortunately, it is usually very difficult and expensive 
to isolate the valuable protein from the other components 
of the expression system. Isolation and purification are 
main contributors to the cost of the products. According to its title the publication in World Biotech 
Reports 2, 1984, pages 175-180 deals with "Concentration & 
partial purification of proteins by absorption on porous 
silica". However, the disclosure of this article is 
incomplete. The protein that was isolated is not identified, 
the exact elution buffer conditions are not specified and 
there are no examples for specific elution conditions. There is a need for a simple method of removing and 
recovering valuable proteins from complex solutions, such 
as fermentation broths and milk, and also a need for a 
method of determining which valuable proteins can be 
removed from such solutions by that method. It is an object of the present invention to disclose 
a method of removing and recovering valuable proteins 
from complex solutions, such as fermentation broths and 
milk. It is a further object to disclose a method of 
determining whether a valuable protein can be removed and 
recovered from a complex solution by the method of the 
present invention.  
 
These and other objects are solved by the methods with the 
features of claims 1 and 2. Preferred embodiments are claimed 
in dependent claims 3 to 8. The wording of all claims is made 
to content of the description by reference. The method of the present invention comprises adding 
to a complex aqueous solution that contains a valuable 
protein, a safe and effective amount of a silica gel 
sorbant, namely a silica hydrogel, xerogel or cogel, 
wherein the pore size of the sorbant is approximately 
equal to the dimension of the protein to be removed, 
intimately mixing the silica gel in the complex solution 
to permit the valuable protein to come into contact with 
and be sorbed to the sorbant , removing the silica gel 
wit
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of removing protein from a solution 
containing that protein, said method comprising 

adding to a solution containing at least one 
protein to be purified an effective amount of a 

silica hydrogel sorbant, a silica xerogel sorbant 
or a silica cogel sorbant to sorb at least some of 

the protein, wherein the pore size of the sorbant 
is approximately equal to the dimension of the 

protein to be removed, intimately distributing the 
sorbant through the solution and permitting the 

sorbant to remain in the solution until protein 
has been sorbed thereon, then removing from the 

solution the sorbant with protein sorbed thereon 
and treating said
 sorbant with an eluent which 
will desorb protein and permit the protein to be 

separated and recovered. 
A method of identifying whether a specific protein 
can be effectively removed from a specific solution 

containing said protein by treatment with a silica 
hydrogel sorbant, a silica xerogel sorbant or a 

silica cogel sorbant, said method comprising adding 
an effective amount of the sorbant to a sample of 

the solution containing the protein to be purified  
 

to sorb the protein, wherein the pore size of the 
sorbant is approximately equal to the dimension of 

the protein to be removed, intimately mixing the 
sorbant with the solution, allowing the sorbant to 

remain in the solution long enough for the protein 
to become sorbed thereon, then removing the sorbant 

from the solution and treating the sorbant with 
different eluents to see which, if any, of the 

eluents desorb protein and allow the protein to be 
separated and recovered. 
A method of claim 1 or 2 in which the protein is 
antifreeze protein. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims 
in which the protein is chymosin. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims 
in which the protein is insulin. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims 
in which the eluent is a hydrophobic solvent. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims 
in which the eluent is a solvent that disrupts 

hydrogen bonds. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims 
in which the eluent is a solvent that disrupts ion 

exchange bonds.
