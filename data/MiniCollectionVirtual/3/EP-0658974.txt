an oscillation signal in response to a resonant element 

in a first mode and to an external clock signal in a 
second mode. This oscillator circuit comprises a tri-state 

inverter circuit and a transfer circuit between

circuit, and the output node of the tri-state inverter 
circuit is brought into a high impedance condition when 

an external clock signal is used and into an active state 
when the resonant element is employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oscillator circuit according to
claim 1 and particularly to an
oscillator circuit generating an oscillation signal in resonse
to, in a first mode, a resonant element such as a crystal and,
in a second mode, an external clock signal.A similar oscillator circuit is known from Patent Abstract of
Japan Vol. 17, No. 401 (E-1404) July 27, 1993, and JP-A-05-075
342. This controller for an oscillator circuit
comprises an inverter having a feedback circuit connected between its input and
output, the inverter further having its input connected to a first terminal which is
connected to a resonant element or to receive an external clock signal, and a detection
circuit connected to the output of the inverter, and
provides an
internal oscillator circuit and a switch which is turned on
for internal oscillation mode while it is turned off for
external oscillation mode.A further oscillator circuit for a portable electronic device
is known from GB-A-2 005 944. This circuit shows a quartz
crystal oscillator circuit
implementing a tri-state inverter as used in the present application and
which comprises a P-MOS and N-MOS
transistor and an inverter. By switching the transistors, the
amplification can be switched on and off, and the quartz
crystal vibrator element is driven into oscillation, or is
left to oscillate substantially freely.An example of a conventional oscillator circuit is shown
in FIG. 11. This circuit is constituted of an inverter circuit
consisting of a P-type MOSFET M1 and an N-type MOSFET M2 and
having an input node connected to a terminal V1 and an output
node connected to a terminal V2, a transfer circuit consisting
of a P-type MOSFET M3 having its drain connected to the
terminal V1 and its source connected to the terminal V2, an N-type
MOSFET M8 connected between the terminal V1 and the
ground, an inverter circuit 11 having its input connected to
the terminal V2 and its output connected to the output VO 
of the oscillator circuit, and an oscillation control
circuit consisting of an inverter circuit 12 and a NOR
circuit 13. A crystal X1 is optionally connected between
the terminal V1 and the terminal V2. In addition, the
oscillator circuit includes a stop input signal VS and
a switching input terminal VX from a data processing unit
such as a CPU (not shown).This circuit operates as a crystal oscillator circuit
when both of the oscillation stop input signal VS and the
oscillation switching input signal VX are at the low level.
This is because the N-type MOSFET M8 is turned off
