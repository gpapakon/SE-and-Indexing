<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for inspecting a figure inscribed on curved 
surface (2a/3a) of an article (1) is disclosed. The article under inspection (1) is 

rotated at pre-set angular increments for dividing the figure inscribed on the 
curved surface (2a/3a) of the article into plural fractions and fetching the picture 

information from plural directions. The picture information of the fractional 
pictures is synthesized into picture information for one full-format picture based 

on which the figure inscribed on the curved surface of the article (1) under 
inspection is inspected. Decision on acceptability may be given automatically and 

quantitatively as compared to the conventional functional inspection. That is, the 
inspection may be performed without regard to the difference in skill from one 

operator to another. In addition, the operator may be relieved from an monotonous 
inspecting operation, while the cost in manpower may be saved. By sorting the 

articles into good and no-good ones based on the results of inspection of the 
figures, the inspection of the articles and sorting into good and no-good articles 

may be performed automatically for saving the manpower. In addition, by 
recognizing the characters or symbols inscribed on the curved surface of the article 

under inspection one by one based on the information of the synthesized fullformat 
picture, and by comparing the character string consisting of the recognized 

characters or symbols to a pre-set control character string, the decision on 
acceptability can be give
n accurately.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for inspecting a figure. 
More particularly, it relates to a method and apparatus for inspecting a figure 
provided on a curved surface, for example, a numeral, letter or character inscribed 
on a mouthpiece of a glass tube fuse. The figure drawn on a curved surface, for example, an inscription on the 
curved surface of the mouthpiece of the glass tube fuse, is difficult to inspect 
automatically, and hence is inspected by visual observation by an operator. Thus 
the characters inscribed on the outer periphery of the mouthpiece, such as rated 
current values or withstand voltages, or symbols, such as UL or CSA standard 
marks or type A marks for electrical components, are visually inspected, as the 
glass tube fuse is rotated about their axes manually, by way of performing a 
functional inspection for checking if the inscriptions are able to pass the 
inspection. Such manual inspection suffers from the problems that the inspection is in 
need of skill and susceptible to fluctuations in the results. In addition, since the 
inscriptions are difficult to view precisely, the inspector's eyes are fatigued. 
Besides, the inspection is a monotonous and physically hard operation. In other 
words, the inspection imposes increased cost in manpower inclusive of the cost of 
pedagogy and training. On the other hand, the glass tube fuse is an electrical component which is 
used in large quantities in the field of consumer equipment and which is critical 
from the viewpoint of safety standards. Besides, in order to acquire recognition of 
the so-called ISO 9000 series, the debut of a suitable inspection device which 
possibly takes the place of visual inspection has been strongly desired. In view of the above-described status of the art, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a method and apparatus for figure inspection whereby a figure 
drawn on an article to be inspected, such as inscriptions on a glass tube fuse, may 
be automatically inspected for avoiding fluctuations in the test results. In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for inspecting a figure 
comprising rotating an article under inspection having a curved surface at an 
interval of a pre-set angle of rotation for dividing the figure inscribed on the 
curved surface of the article under inspection into plural picture fractions, fetching 
and synthesizing the picture information from the plural directions, and inspecting  
 
the figure inscribed on the curved surface of the

A method for inspecting a figure comprising : 
   rotating an article under inspection (1) having a curved surface (2a/3a) at an 

interval of a pre-set angle of rotation for dividing the figure inscribed on said 
curved surface (2a/3a) of the article under inspection (1) into plural picture 

fractions for fetching the picture information from plural directions, 
   synthesizing said picture information from the plural directions, and 

   inspecting the figure inscribed on the curved surface (2a/3a) of said article 
under inspection (1) based on the synthesized picture information. 
The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the article under inspection (1) is 
sorted based on the results of inspection of the figure. 
The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the article under inspection (1) is 
rotated through (360° + pre-set angle) and plural picture fractions are synthesized 

into one full format picture in which one of overlapping fractional pictures is 
discarded. 
The method as claimed in claim 3 wherein the figure is made up of 
characters or symbols, the characters or symbols are recognized one by one, and 

wherein a character string made up of the recognized characters or symbols is 
compared to a pre-set control character string by way of performing figure 

inspection. 
An apparatus for inspecting a figure comprising : 
   means (11) for rotating an article under inspection (1) having a curved 

surface (2a/3a) at an interval of a pre-set angle of rotation, 
   imaging means (13) for imaging the figure inscribed on the curved surface 

(2a/3a) of the article (1) for each pre-set angle of rotation for outputting the picture 
information data from plural directions,
