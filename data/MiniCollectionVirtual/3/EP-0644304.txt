<ABSTRACT>
An overhead gantry system of the type used to mount traffic signs in constructed from a set of modulator parts. The main sections (5) are produced as metal extrusions that have tapped holes for securing preformed brackets at regular intervals along the length. The brackets have fixing points for the insertion of bracing struts (28) that are located along the length of the structure. Corner brackets are also used for fixing vertical and horizontal units together.

each case has two (11, 12) or three guide rails (11,
12, 13), with adjacent guide rails (11, 12; 11, 13;

12, 13) being in each case arranged at an angle to
one another of 90° and 45°, respectively.
Support frame system according to any of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the guide rail (11, 12, 13)

is in each case in the form of an undercut slot (14),
more particularly one having a T-shaped cross-section.
Support frame system according to any of claims 1 to
4, characterised in that in the longitudinal

direction of the associated guide rail (11, 12, 13)
the connection element (27) is located positively in

the principal support (5).
Support frame system according to claim 5,
characterised in that the connection element (5) is

provided with at least one threaded through-bore (51)
arranged perpendicularly to the longitudinal

extension of the guide rail (11, 12, 13), which
through-bore (51) is used to receive the fixing means

constructed in the form of a threaded bolt (53) and
the threaded bolt (53) passes through a blind hole

(52) in the principal support (5), the connection
element (27) being adapted to be tensioned by means

of the threaded bolt (53) between the floor of the
blind hole (52) and a section (56) of the principal

support (5) that engages behind the connection
element (27), and also being adapted to be located in

the longitudinal extension of the guide rail (11, 12,
13).
Support frame system according to any of claims 1 to
6, characterised in that additional fixing means (59,

60) are provided which join the respective end (28b)
of the bar in an articulated manner to the connection

element (27), the fixing means in each case having a
screw (60), bolt or the like, which is pushed through

bores (28d, 48) in the end (28b) of the bar and in
the connection element (27) and is secured by means

of a nut (59), a split pin or the like. 
Support frame system according to any of claims 1 to
7, characterised in that each bar (28) is formed by

a tube (28a) and two bar end pieces (28b), one tube
extremity being provided with a left-handed thread

and the other tube extremity with a right-handed
thread, and the ends (28b) of the bars which are

adapted to be screwed into the tube (28a) are in each
case provided with a corresponding thread and with a

locator remote from the thread for connection to the
associated principal support (5) or to the associated

connection element (27).
Support frame system according to claim 8,
characterised in that the bar (28b) locator remote

from the thread is in each case constructed as a
bifurcated piece with bores (28d) which pass through

both fork prongs (28c) and the connection element
(27) has a plate-shaped lug (46) with a through-bore

(48), with a bolt, or screw (60), passing through the
bores of the bifurcated piece and the shoulder (46).
