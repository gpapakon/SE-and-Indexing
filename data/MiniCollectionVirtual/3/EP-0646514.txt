<ABSTRACT>
A protective frame (1) for a stroller including a 
seat portion is described, and comprises a pair of 

armrest poles disposed on opposite sides of the seat 
portion, a pair of retaining bodies (5) releasably 

attached to the armrest poles, respectively, a pair 
of rigid pole bodies (11, 12) coupled to the 

retaining bodies (5), respectively, and a joint 
mechanism (2, 3) for joining ends of the pole bodies 

(11, 12) together, and for being detachable into two

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
protective frame for a stroller and, more 
particularly, to a protective frame for a stroller 
that can prevent a baby from falling down from a seat 
by attaching a protective frame in such a manner as to 
span between the ends of stroller armrest poles. The attachment of a protective frame to the ends 
of armrest poles in order to prevent a several-month-old 
baby from falling forward off of a stroller seat 
is disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Unexamined Utility 
Model Publication No. 4-88570. However, this protective frame is formed of a 
single rod-like body whose length corresponds to a 
distance between the two confronting armrest poles, 
and both ends of the protective frame are releasably 
attached to the ends of the armrest poles. As a 
result of such construction, every time the baby is to 
be seated or unseated, the protective frame spanning 
between the armrest poles must be released, which is 
an extremely cumbersome operation. In addition, the stroller is cumbersome in that 
it lacks not only a space for maintaining the released 
protective frame but also a means for carrying the  
 
released protective frame when the protective frame is 
to be temporarily released from the stroller. As a 
result, the user must either leave the protective 
frame attached to the ends of the armrest poles or 
remove the protective frame completely. Accordingly, one object of the present invention 
is to provide a device which overcomes the above 
problem. According to an embodiment of the invention, 
a stroller protective frame is provided which is 
capable of opening the front of the seat with both 
ends of the protective frame attached to the ends of 
the armrest poles. This is accomplished by arranging 
a single rod-like formed protective frame which is 
able to be split into two parts in the middle thereof, 
whereby a baby can be seated or unseated with extreme 
ease. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a protective frame for a stroller capable of 
suspending the two split protective frame parts from 
the ends of the two confronting armrest poles in order 
to provide a space for holding the protective frame 
when the stroller is to be used with the front of the 
seat opened. The protective frame for a stroller according to 
an embodiment of the invention is characterized in  
 
that a middle portion thereof is arranged so as to be 
split into two pole bodies by a joint mechanism; and 
retaining bodies are coupled to base end portions of 
the
