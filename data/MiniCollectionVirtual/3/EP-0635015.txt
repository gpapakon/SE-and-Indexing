These compounds are useful in treating migraine and other disorders. These compounds are useful psychotherapeutics and are potent serotonin (5-HT1) agonists and may be used in the treatment of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, obesity, drug abuse, cluster headache, migraine, pain, and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and headache associated with vascular disorders, and other disorders arising from deficient serotonergic neurotransmission. The compounds can also be used as centrally acting antihypertensives and vasodilators.
