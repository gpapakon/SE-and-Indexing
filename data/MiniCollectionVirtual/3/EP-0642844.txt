<ABSTRACT>
To improve the sieving result, in a sieving machine with a three-dimensional sieving motion, with a sieve carrier (19) for the at least one sieve tray (22), the sieve carrier arranged moveably relative to the housing (10) and loaded by an electromagnet (26) as a drive being supported relative to the housing by means of springs (18), provision is made for designing the springs as leaf springs (18) which extend in a plane parallel to the baseplate of the sieve carrier (19) and of which the clamping points (17, 21) on the housing (10, 16) on the one hand and on the sieve carrier (19, 20) on the other hand are arranged tilted by an angular amount in relation to the horizontal baseplate plane, so that the spring surfaces (18a) of the leaf springs (18) have a run which is correspondingly tilted out of their running plane about their longitudinal axis.

Screening machine with a three-dimensional screening
movement and a screen-carrier (19) for the screening

tray (23), of which there is at least one, having a
horizontally orientated base plate, while the screen-carrier

(19), which is disposed so as to be movable in
the vertical direction in relation to the housing (10)

and is acted upon by an electromagnet (26) as the
drive, is supported against the housing (10) via

springs (18), characterised in that the springs are
constructed as leaf springs (18) which extend in a

plane parallel to the base plate of the screen-carrier
(19) and the gripping systems (17, 21) for which, on

the housing (10, 16) on the one hand, and on the
screen-carrier (19, 20) on the other, are disposed so

as to be tilted by an angular amount referred to the
horizontal plane of the base plate, so that the spring

faces (18a) of the leaf springs (18) follow a path
which is tilted about their longitudinal axis, out of

the plane of their path, in a corresponding manner.
Screening machine according to claim 1, characterised
in that the angula
r amount is one to five degrees.
Screening machine according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the housing (10) is of pot-like

construction, with a rim (16) which engages round the
screen-carrier (19, 20) and receives the gripping

systems (17) at the housing end for the leaf springs
(18), and that the leaf springs (18) are disposed in a

star-shaped path between the rim (16) and the screen-carrier
(19, 20).
Screening machine according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the screen-carrier has a 

clamping block (20) which projects into the region
enclosed by the rim (16) of the housing (10) and on

which the gripping systems (21) for the leaf springs
(18) are disposed.
Screening machine according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that three leaf springs (18) are

provided in a symmetrical disposition.
Screening machine according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that six leaf springs (18) are

provided in a symmetrical disposition.
