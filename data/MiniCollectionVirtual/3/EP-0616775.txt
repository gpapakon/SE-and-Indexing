<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a track apparatus for egg
breaking mechanisms which can be advantageously incorporated in
an automatic egg breaking apparatus for successively breaking
eggs and taking out their contents.As is well known, eggs have found wide use. For
example, the egg yolk may be used as a material for making
mayonnaise or other food products. The egg white (albumen) may
be used for making pharmaceutical products or as a binder for
protein products. Due to such wide use of the egg, it is
absolutely necessary in industry to use an automatic egg
breaking apparatus for breaking eggs and taking out their
contents at high speed.Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-59089 discloses an
egg breaking apparatus wherein an endless chain conveyor as a
track apparatus carries a plurality of egg breaking mechanisms
at a constant pitch along the endless moving path of the chain
conveyor. The chain conveyor is held in engagement with a
plurality of sprocket assemblies as direction change
assemblies, so that the moving path of the chain conveyor is
divided by the direction change assemblies into different
regions where each of the egg breaking mechanisms is caused to
perform different operations which include egg reception, egg
breaking, cleaning, and etc. One of the sprocket assemblies is
a drive sprocket assembly for causing movement of the chain
conveyor. According to the prior art arrangement, all of the
direction change assemblies are in the form of sprocket
assemblies which cannot be conveniently cleaned due to
the presence of the sprocket teeth. Thus, the prior art
track assembly as a whole suffers a hygienic problem
resulting from bacterial breeding at the sprocket
assemblies which are fouled by the egg residues but
insufficiently cleaned later.It is, therefore, an object of the present
invention to provide a track apparatus for egg breaking
mechanisms which can be more conveniently washed than
the prior art track apparatus.DE-A-2,511,420 discloses a chain tensioning
mechanism used in a chain tensioning assembly. No
mention is made of egg breaking mechanisms.According to the present invention, there is
provided a track apparatus for egg breaking mechanisms
comprising an endless chain conveyor extending along an
endless moving path and carrying the egg breaking
mechanisms, a drive sprocket assembly held in driving
engagement with the chain conveyor and serving as a
direction change assembly for changing an extending
direction of the moving path, and at least two
additional direction change assemblies
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A track apparatus for egg breaking mechanisms
comprising an endless chain conveyor (5) extending

along an endless moving path and carrying the egg
breaking mechanisms (20), a drive sprocket assembly

(2) held in driving engagement with the chain conveyor
(5) and serving as a direction change assembly for

changing an extending direction of the moving path,
and at least two additional direction change

assemblies (3, CT) contacting the chain conveyor (5)
for further changing the extending direction of the

moving path, characterized in that

the additional direction change assemblies
