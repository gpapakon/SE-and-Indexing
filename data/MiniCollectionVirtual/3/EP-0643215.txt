<ABSTRACT>
A pilot injection control system for an internal
combustion engine comprises a plurality of fuel injection

nozzles, the valve-opening pressure of one of which (the
reference nozzle) is set slightly higher than that of the

other nozzles, means for detecting the pilot injection of
the reference nozzle, and means for feedback controlling

the pilot injection quantity of the reference nozzle based
on the detected pilot injection. The system is able to

effectively control the pilot injection of all nozzles by
actually controlling the pilot injection of only one nozzle

and can therefore be implemented at low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pilot injection
control system and more particularly to a pilot injection
control system capable of monitoring the pilot injection
state of an injection nozzle and utilizing the monitored
state to ensure stable pilot injection.In diesel engines it is a common practice to
divide the fuel injection into a pilot injection (initial
injection) stage and an ensuing main injection stage so as
to reduce ignition delay, prevent generation of oxides of
nitrogen and lower combustion noise.Pilot injection control is difficult, however,
because the quantity of fuel injected in each diesel engine
cylinder during pilot injection is required to be regulated
to an extremely small value on the order of, for example,
5mm3/stroke and, moreover, the injection quantity is highly
sensitive to the valve-opening pressure of the fuel
injection nozzle.As taught in Japanese Patent Public Disclosures
Sho 63-18156 and Hei 4-175438, for example, it has
therefore been proposed to provide means for detecting the
presence/absence or the quantity of pilot injection by the
fuel injection nozzle and to feedback control the pilot
injection based on the result of the detection. However,
this method requires every fuel injection nozzle or every
cylinder equipped with a fuel injection nozzle to be
provided with a sensor for detecting the pilot injection
state. It thus results in a complex and expensive control
system.This invention was completed in the light of the
foregoing problem and has as its object to provide a pilot 
injection control system capable of ensuring stable pilot
injection with a simple control system.The inventors discovered (a) that in pilot
injection some degree of degradation in fuel injection
quantity control can be tolerated insofar as the injection
quantity stays within a certain range, (b) that where the
ideal pilot injection quantity per cylinder is 5mm3/stroke,
for example, combustion is little affected by either
repeated or simple variance from this value insofar as the
pilot injection quantity stays within the range of around
1 to 8mm3/stroke, (c) that the effect on combustion is
smaller in the case where the pilot injection quantity is
too low than in the case where it is too high, and (d) that
while a complete lack of pilot injection (zero pilot
injection quantity) causes a problem, even a slight
quantity suffices.This invention was accomplished on the basis of
this knowledge and takes advantage of the fact that the
pilot injection quantity of a nozzle is a function of the
nozzle's
