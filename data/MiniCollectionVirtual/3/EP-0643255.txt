<ABSTRACT>
An electric lamp (1), in particular a metal-halide high-pressure discharge lamp for motor vehicle headlamps (headlights), has integrated in the cap (2) a strain relief for the feed cables (6a, 6b). The strain relief contains resilient (springy) sleeves (11a, 11b) which surround the feed cables (6a, 6b) in a positive and/or non-positive manner. For this purpose, the sleeves (11a, 11b) are in each case provided with at least one slot in such a manner that a reduction of the initial circumference can be accomplished by forces which act radially from outside on the sleeve. The radial forces are advantageously produced by pressing the sleeves (11a, 11b) into conical holes (10a, 10b) in the cap base (9) during assembly.

<CLAIMS>
Electric lamp (1) having a lamp bulb (4), which 
is retained by a base (2), the base (2) having a base 

portion (7) facing the lamp bulb (4) and a bottom portion 
(9) facing away from the lamp bulb (4), a light-emitting 

means (3a,b) in the lamp bulb (4) being electrically 
conductively connected by means of current supply leads 

(5a,b) to supply cables (6a, b), each having a deformable 
insulating cover (12a, b) and being led out of the bottom 

portion (9, 9'), a strain-relief mechanism for the 
electric supply cables (6a, b) being integrated in the 

base, characterized by a strain relief which is designed 
such that 


in each case a resilient sleeve (11a, b) surrounds an 
electric supply cable (6a, b) in a non-positive and/or 

positive manner, 
the bottom portion (9) is connected to the upper base 
portion (7), the resilient sleeves (11a,b) being surrounded 

by bores (10a,b) of an auxiliary part in a non-positive 
and/or positive manner in such a way that 

essentially radially inwardly acting forces are exerted 
on the sleeve, as the result of which a reduction, which 

is possible because of the resilient action, of the 
sleeve circumference is achieved, so that in each case 

the inner wall (18) of the sleeves (11a,b) elastically 
squeezes the deformable insulating covers (12a,b) of the 

electric supply cables (6a,b) and/or engages in the 
insulating covers (12a,b). 
Electric lamp according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the auxiliary part is a component of the bottom 

portion (9).  
 
Electric lamp according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the smallest original outer diameter of the 

sleeves (11a,b) is smaller than the greatest inner 
diameter of the associated bores (10a,b), so that the 

sleeves (11a,b) can be inserted into the associated bores 
(10a,b). 
Electric lamp according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the outer walls of the sleeves (11a,b) are at 

least partly of conical design. 
Electric lamp according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the outer walls of the sleeves (11a,b) are 

essentially circularly cylindrical and each have at least 
one axial bulge which extends and tapers over at least a 

part region along the sleeves. 
Electric lamp according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the inner walls of the bores (10a,b) are at least 

partly of conical design. 
Electric lamp according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the inner walls of the bores (10a,b) each have at 

least one axial bulge which extends and tapers over at 
least a part region along the bore. 
Electric lamp according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the inner wall (18) of the outwardly conical 

sleeves (11a,b) has a profile which facilitates the 
squeezing engagement and hence reinforces the positive 

and/or non-positive connection between sleeve and insulating 
cover. 
Electric lamp according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the profile of the inner wall (18) is formed by 

an essentially circularly cylindrical surface which has 
a constriction (19) at at least one end (15) of the 

sleeve. 
Electric lamp according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the profile of the inner wall (18) is formed by 

a concave surface.

a rotationally symmetrical sawtooth-like structure.

slits (14b,d) start from the first end of the sleeve (11) 

and two diametrically opposite slits (14a,14c) rotated 
through 90Â° start from the second end, as a result of
