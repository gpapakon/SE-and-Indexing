<ABSTRACT>
In mobile radio systems, repeaters are used for guaranteeing the transmission of information over great distances by means of mobile transceivers which have a low transmitting power. A low transmitting power is sought so that, among other things, any risks to the health of the subscribers are reduced. The repeater (R) used in the mobile radio system has a transmitting antenna (1) which has an antenna pattern (S1) which is raised with respect to a horizontal conductive area (4), and a receiving antenna (2) which has an antenna pattern (E2) which is lowered with respect to the area (4). Transmitting and receiving occur at the same frequency and without a time slot being changed.
