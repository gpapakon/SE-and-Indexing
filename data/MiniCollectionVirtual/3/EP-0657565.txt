the supporting body (5) has guides lying opposite one 

another for each brake lever (4, 4') of the brake body 
(3). 
Brake according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that each of the guides consists of two vertical webs 

(15, 16; 15', 16') spaced apart from one another, the  
 

front web (15, 15') being situated in the region of the 
first vertical bearings (7, 7'). 
Brake according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the brake body (3) has in the 

central region at least one film hinge (17, 18) to 
connect the two brake levers (4, 4'), each brake lever 

(4, 4') being provided behind the central region with a 
resilient leg (19, 20) which on the inside has an engagement 

surface (21, 22, 21', 22') for the expanding device 
(23). 
Brake according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
in the central region two film hinges (17, 18) lying 

opposite one another are provided. 
Brake according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the engagement surfaces (21, 22, 21', 22') of the 

legs (19, 20) are arranged at an acute angle to one 
another. 
Brake according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the engagement surfaces (21, 22) of each leg (19, 20) 

are angular in shape, comprising a flat starting region 
(24, 25) and a steeper end region (27,27'). 
Brake according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the legs (19, 20) of the brake body 

(3) are provided on the outer side with curved spring 
elements (26, 26') which at the front side merge into a 

groove (28, 28') receiving the front web (15, 15') of the 
supporting body (5) and which in the middle are guided by 

the second web (16, 16') and at the rear side extend to 
the starting region of the legs (19, 20) of the respective 

brake lever (4, 4'). 
Brake according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that brake elements (29, 29') acting on 

the spindle (2) are inserted into the brake levers (4, 
4'). 
Brake according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
in the top region the actuating plate (13) has horizontally 

extending pins (30, 30') which can be hung in the 
pivot bearings (14, 14') of the supporting body (5) and 

between which, on the rear side (31) of the actuating  
 

plate (13), extends the block-like expanding device (23) 
which is inclined relative to the vertical plane and 

extends downwards to the height of the engagement 
surfaces (21, 22, 21', 22') of the legs (19, 20) of the 

brake body (3). 
Brake according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the front side of the actuating plate (13) extends 

beyond the underside of the supporting body (5). 
Brake according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that in its vertically extending edge region the expanding 

device (23) has actuating surfaces (32, 32') acting 
on the engagement surfaces (21, 22; 21', 22') of the legs 

(19, 20) of the brake body (3). 
Brake according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the actuating surfaces (32, 32') are conically 

bevelled relative to one another. 
Brake according to Claims 6 and 12, characterized 
in that on the inner side of the legs (19, 20) of the 

brake lever (4, 4') the engagement surfaces (21', 22') 
extending at an acute angle to one another are provided 

in the front region with undercuts (33'), and in 
that the actuating surfaces of the actuating plate (13) 

have beads (32") which can engage behind the undercuts 
(33'). 
Brake according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that above the pins
 (30, 30') the actuating plate (13) is
