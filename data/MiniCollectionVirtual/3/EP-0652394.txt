<ABSTRACT>
A control valve includes a valve member (7) shaped for engagement with 
a seating (6) which is defined about a flow passage (3). The valve 

member is movable between the open and closed positions by an 
actuator (14). Formed in the valve member is a blind drilling (9) in 

which is located a plunger (11) engageable with a fixed reaction surface 
(12) external of the valve member. The inner end of the drilling 

communicates with a passage (13) which communicates with the flow 
passage (3). The valve member is slidable in a bore (2) which adjacent 

the seating is of enlarged diameter to define a recess (4) which 
communicates with a further flow passage (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control valve for controlling fluid flow
between a pair of passages and of the kind comprising a valve member
movable into engagement with a seating to prevent fluid flow between
the passages and actuator means coupled to the valve member for
effecting movement of the valve member towards and away from the
seating.A three way valve is disclosed in EP-A-0367114 which comprises a valve
member engageable with a seating. A drilling is provided in the valve
member within which a plunger is slidable, the plunger being
engageable with a seating provided on the valve member. The plunger
and drilling define a chamber which communicates with a pair of
passages, engagement of the plunger with its seating breaking
communication between the passages.GB-A-2168130 describes a two way valve in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 which comprises a valve
member slidable in a bore and engageable with a seating defined around
a part of the bore of reduced diameter to control communication
between a pair of passages. One of the passages communicates with a 
recess which forms part of the bore upstream of the seating, the other
passage communicating with the bore downstream of the seating.The object of the invention is to provide such a valve in a simple and
convenient form.According to the invention a two way control valve for controlling fluid
flow between a pair of passages comprises a cylindrical valve member
slidable in a bore, a seating defined in the bore about a narrower portion
of the bore which serves as one of the flow passages, the valve member
being shaped for co-operation with the seating, a recess defined in the
bore adjacent the seating, said recess communicating with the other of
the flow passages, and actuator means coupled to the valve member, and
characterized by a blind drilling formed in the valve member, a plunger
slidable in the drilling and defining with the drilling a chamber, said
plunger being engageable with a fixed reaction surface and a passage
formed in the valve member, said passage opening to the exterior of the
valve member at a position to communicate with said one flow passage,
the chamber communicating exclusively with the passage.An example of a control valve in accordance with the invention will now
be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- 
Figure 1 shows a part sectional side elevation of the valve, andFigure 2 shows a sectional side elevation of a fuel system incorporating
the valve of Figure 1.With reference to Figure 1, the
