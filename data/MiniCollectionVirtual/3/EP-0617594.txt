<ABSTRACT>
A pusher-vasoocclusive coil assembly (11) that is advanced through a catheter (21) to a site within a vessel and is manipulated to detach the coil (13) from the assembly. The coil (13) has an affixed, proximally-extending wire (15) that carries a ball (16) on its proximal end and the pusher (18) has an affixed, distally-extending wire (19) that carries a ball (20) on its distal end. The pusher and coil are coupled by placing the wires and balls in an overlapping interlocked position and enclosing the coupled assembly with a coaxial sleeve (14). The coil-pusher-sleeve assembly is positioned at the site and the sleeve is retracted to allow the balls to move radially relative to one another to disengage and uncouple the pusher and coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the general field 
of surgical instruments and relates specifically to an 
apparatus for delivering a vasoocclusion coil to a 
selected site within a vessel (e.g., an aneurysm) via a 
catheter. Vasoocclusion coils or wires are used to 
occlude a site, such as an aneurysm, within a vessel. 
The coils may be of a regular (e.g., helical) 
configuration or assume a random convoluted configuration 
at the site. Vasoocclusion coils are described in 
US-A-4,994,069. The coils are normally made of a 
radioopaque, biocompatible metal such as platinum, gold, 
or tungsten. In treating aneurysms it is common to place 
a plurality, typically 4 to 12, coils within the 
aneurysm. The coils occlude the site by posing a 
physical barrier to blood flow and by promoting thrombus 
formation at the site. The coil(s) have typically been placed at the 
desired site using a catheter and a pusher. The site is 
first accessed by the catheter. In treating peripheral 
or neural conditions requiring occlusion, the sites are 
accessed with flexible, small diameter catheters such as  
 
the catheters described in US-A-4,739,768 
and US-A-4,813,934. The catheter may be guided to the site 
through the use of guidewires (see US-A-4,884,579) 
and/or flow-directed means such as balloons at 
the distal end of the catheter. Once the site has been 
accessed, the catheter lumen is cleared (i.e., the 
guidewire is removed if a guidewire has been used) and 
the coil is placed in the proximal end of the catheter 
and advanced through the catheter with a pusher. Pushers 
are wires having a distal end that is adapted to engage 
and push the coil distally as the pusher is advanced 
through the catheter. When the coil reaches the distal 
end of the catheter it is plunged therefrom by the pusher 
into the vessel. This technique of plunging the coil 
from the distal end of the catheter has undesirable 
limitations. First, because of the plunging action, the 
positioning of the coil at the site cannot be controlled 
to a fine degree of accuracy. Second, once plunged from 
the catheter, it is difficult to reposition or retrieve 
the coil if desired. Indeed, another device, called a 
retriever, must be threaded through the catheter to snare 
the coil to reposition or retrieve it. In view of these limitations, techniques have 
recently been developed to enable more accurate placement 
of coils within a vessel. In one technique (described in 
WO-A-91/13592 upon which is based the preamble of claim 1) 
the coil is bonded via a

comprising in combination: 

a vasoocclusive coil (13) having a proximal end; and 
a pusher (12) having a distal end;

the proximal end of the coil carries a first radial 
protuberance (16); 
the distal end of the pusher (12) has an affixed, 
distally extending wire (19) on which a second radial 

protuberance (20) is carried, said second protuberance

first radial protuberance (20);

coaxially about the pusher (12) and coil (13) that is 

axially movable relative to the coil and pusher from a 
first position at which the means encloses the overlapped, 

interlocked protuberances (16,20) to prevent said 
protuberances from substantial radial movement relative to 

each other to a second position at which the means does not 
enclose the protuberances and the protuberances are free to 

disengage; and 
the wire (19) is radially biased to cause 
disengagement of the protuberances (16,20) upon axial 

movement of said means (14,21) from said first position to
