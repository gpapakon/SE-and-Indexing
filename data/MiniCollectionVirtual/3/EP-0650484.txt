<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical
compositions containing these compounds and their use as endothelin receptor
antagonists.Endothelin (ET) is a highly potent vasoconstrictor peptide synthesized and
released by the vascular endothelium. Endothelin exists as three isoforms, ET-1,
ET-2 and ET-3. [Unless otherwise stated "endothelin" shall mean any or all of the
isoforms of endothelin]. Endothelin has profound effects on the cardiovascular
system, and in particular, the coronary, renal and cerebral circulation. Elevated or
abnormal release of endothelin is associated with smooth muscle contraction which
is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, respiratory and
renal pathophysiology. Elevated levels of endothelin have been reported in plasma
from patients with essential hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, atherosclerosis, and patients with uraemia undergoing dialysis.Invivo, endothelin has pronounced effects on blood pressure and cardiac
output. An intravenous bolus injection of ET (0.1 to 3 nmol/kg) in rats causes a
transient, dose-related depressor response (lasting 0.5 to 2 minutes) followed by a
sustained, dose-dependent rise in arterial blood pressure which can remain elevated
for 2 to 3 hours following dosing. Doses above 3 nmol/kg in a rat often prove fatal.Endothelin appears to produce a preferential effect in the renal vascular bed.
It produces a marked, long-lasting decrease in renal blood flow, accompanied by a
significant decrease in GFR, urine volume, urinary sodium and potassium excretion.
Endothelin produces a sustained antinatriuretic effect, despite significant elevations
in atrial natriuretic peptide. Endothelin also stimulates plasma renin activity. These
findings suggest that ET is involved in the regulation of renal function and is
involved in a variety of renal disorders including acute renal failure, cyclosporine
nephro-toxicity and chronic renal failure.Studies have shown that invivo, the cerebral vasculature is highly sensitive
to both the vasodilator and vasoconstrictor effects of endothelin. Therefore, ET may
be an important mediator of cerebral vasospasm, a frequent and often fatal
consequence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. ET also inhibits direct central nervous system effects such as severe apnea
and ischemic lesions which suggests that ET may contribute to the development of
cerebral infarcts and neuronal death.ET has also been implicated in myocardial ischemia (Nichols et al. Br. J.
