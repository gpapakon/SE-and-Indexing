<ABSTRACT>
A smoke simulator contains a transparent body (5) in which are enclosed incident light scattering centres (6). In order to regulate the sensitivity of smoke alarms having a light source (1), a sensor (2), a measurement volume (3) crossed by light and evaluation electronics, the transparent body (5) is placed in a defined position in the measurement volume (3) and is lighted by the light source (1). The evaluation electronics is then tuned to the output of a predetermined signal which preferably corresponds to the smoke density which forms the alarm concentration of the smoke alarm.

<CLAIMS>
Smoke simulation means for scattered-light detectors
which have a light source, a test volume illuminated by the

latter and a sensor for measuring the scattered light
generated in the test volume, characterized by a

transparent body (5, 5') which can be introduced into the
test volume (3) and in which scattering centres (6, 6') for

the incident light are enclosed.
Smoke simulation means according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the scattering centres (6, 6') are

enclosed in the transparent body (5, 5') in a positionally
fixed manner.
Smoke simulation means according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the scattering centres (6, 6') are

formed by solid-body particles.
Smoke simulation means according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the scattering centres (6, 6') are

formed by cavities enclosed in the transparent body (5,
5').
Smoke simulation means according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterized in th
at the scattering centres (6, 6') are
uniformly distributed in the transparent body (5, 5').
Smoke simulation means according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the transparent body (5, 5') is

mounted on a carrier (4) and forms a test insert (P, P')
with the latter, and in that means are provided for

positioning and fixing the test insert in the detector.
Smoke simulation means according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the scattering centres (6, 6') have a

predetermined size distribution, and in that their mean
diameter is not more than 50 Âµm. 
Smoke simulation means according to Claims 3 and 7,
characterized in that the transparent body (5, 5') is

composed of a silicone rubber, and in that the scattering
centres (6, 6') are formed by aluminium oxide particles.
Method of adjusting the smoke sensitivity of a light
source, a sensor, a test volume passed through by the light

and scattered-light detectors having evaluation electronics
using the smoke simulation means in accordance with Claim

1, characterized in that the transparent body (5) is
introduced into the test volume (3) of the detector (SM) to

be adjusted in a defined position and is illuminated by the
light source (1), and in that the evaluation electronics

(11) are adjusted to emit a predetermined signal
corresponding to a certain smoke density.
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in that the
predetermined signal corresponds to that smoke density

which forms the alarm concentration of the scattered light
detector (SM).
Use of the smoke-density simulation means according to
Claim 1 for testing the smoke sensitivity of scattered-light

smoke detectors, characterized in that a transparent
body (5) is introduced into the detector (SM) to be tested,

which transparent body (5) contains scattering centres (6)
having a spatial distribution which is such that, after

insertion into the detector, its test volume (3) is at
least partially filled with scattering centres of a

concentration such that a smoke concentration is simulated
which is above the alarm concentration of the detector.
Use of the smoke-density simulation means according to
Claim 1 for testing scattered-light smoke detectors for

soiling, characterized in that a transparent body (5') is
introduced into the detector (SM) to be tested, which

transparent body (5') contains scattering centres (6') 
having a spatial distribution which is such that, after

introduction into the detector, the test volume
corresponding to an unsoiled detector is free of scattering

centres.
