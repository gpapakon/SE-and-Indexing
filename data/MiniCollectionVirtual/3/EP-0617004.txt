<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an unique method 
for preparing N-substituted-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamines 
from a mixture of N-phenyl-p-quinoneimine 
and p-hydroxydiphenylamine. 
N-substituted-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamines are useful 
as in the production of drugs, agricultural products, 
and useful as dyes, antioxidants, antiozonants, gel 
inhibitors and polymerization inhibitors for rubber. N-substituted-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamines have 
been made by a variety of methods known to those 
skilled in the art. For example, Japanese Application 
125343-1981 discloses a process for the preparation of 
phenylenediamines or its N-substitution product by 
reacting aminophenol or its N-substitution product 
with (a) ammonia, primary amine or secondary amine in 
the presence of an acidic catalyst and polycyclic 
aromatic compound. The process disclosed in Japanese 
Application No. 125343-1981 is characterized by a one 
step, one pot procedure and suggests via gas 
chromatography that yields are upwards to 50 percent. 
However, preparation of the products by this procedure 
would necessitate the use of elaborate distillation 
equipment to remove the polycyclic aromatic compounds 
that are employed. The removal of the polycyclic 
aromatic compounds further contributes to the expense 
of manufacturing the N-substituted-N'-phenyl-phenylenediamine. 
U.S. Patent 4,968,843 discloses a 
process for the preparation of a N-substituted-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine. 
The process in this patent 
involves reacting N-phenyl-p-quinoneimine with a 
primary amine. This patent teaches that the N-phenyl-p-quinoneimine 
reactant should not contain more than 5 
weight percent p-hydroxydiphenylamine and preferably  
 
no or only trace amounts are present. The patent 
teaches that with an increasing amount of p-hydroxydiphenylamine, 
there is an increasing 
hinderance of the reaction to yield the N-substitutedN'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine. 
Since demand for 
N-substituted-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamines is on the 
increase with their wide-spread applications, there is 
a need for a new and more efficient process for their 
production. The present invention relates to a process for 
the preparation of N-substituted-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamines 
by reacting (a) a reaction mixture 
of (1) N-phenyl-p-quinoneimine and (2) p-hydroxydiphenylamine 
with (b) a primary amine. There is disclosed a process for the preparation 
of a N-substituted-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine of the 
formula: 
comprising reacting (a) a mixture of (1)
