<ABSTRACT>
A sound field control device includes an acoustic 
feedback signal path including a chamber (22) and one or 

more loudspeaker or loudspeakers (24) and one or more 
microphone or microphones (30) provided in the chamber, 

the loudspeakers being disposed at a predetermined 
distance from the microphones, and at least either the 

loudspeakers or the microphones being provided in the 
plural, an electrical feedback signal path for feeding 

back a collected sound signal collected by the 
microphone or microphones to the loudspeaker or 

loudspeakers, and a collected sound signal supply 
control circuit (66) provided in the electrical feedback 

signal path for changing, with lapse of time, a signal 
level of each collected sound signal fed back from the 

microphones to the loudspeakers. The transmission route 
of the collected sound signal is completely switched or 

the ratio of distribution of the collected sound signal 
is changed. Coloration in hearing is thereby reduced 

and a margin of howling is expanded without causing 
unnaturalness in hearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for controlling
a sound field of space in a chamber such as a concert
hall by using an acoustic feedback system and, more
particularly, to a device of this type capable of
reducing coloration and expanding a margin of howling
without causing unnaturalness in hearing and also
improving diffusion characteristics of the acoustic
feedback system.As a conventional device for controlling diffusion
in an inner space of a chamber by a mechanical system, a
rotary diffusion plate is generally employed. According
to this device, a diffusion plate provided in a chamber
is continuously rotated through an attenuation process
of a reverberation attenuation waveform to timewise
change the boundary condition in the chamber.
Frequency, propagation route and level of the mode
(i.e., standing wave) of the chamber are thereby
changed timewise to bring about a state which is
equivalent to increase in the number of the mode and
thereby to improve the sound field control capability.There have also been various acoustic feedback type
devices as shown, for example, in Fig. 2 which have
electro-acoustically realized a sound field control 
including prolongation of reverberation. These devices
will be referred to as "sound control devices"
hereafter. In the example of Fig. 2, a loudspeaker 12
and a microphone 14 are disposed at some interval from
each other in a chamber 10. A sound collected by the
microphone 14 is supplied through a head amplifier 16 to
an FIR (finite impulse response) filter 18 to produce a
reverberation signal. This reverberation signal is fed
back to the loudspeaker 12 through an amplifier 20 and
diffusion of the sound field in the chamber 10 is
thereby realized. In such acoustic feedback system or
sound field control device, however, delay time caused
by the distance between the loudspeaker 12 and the
microphone 14 is constant and this gives rise to the
problem that a sharp peak appears in the frequency axis
and this causes coloration in hearing and howling at the
peak position.In the prior art sound field control devices, it
has been attempted to prevent occurrence of a sharp peak
in the frequency axis and thereby reduce coloration and
expand a margin of howling by shifting a parameter of
the FIR filter 18 continuously and randomly on the time
axis.Shifting of a parameter of the FIR filter 18 on the
time axis, however, produces a change on the frequency
axis and this generates distortion due to frequency 
modulation which causes unnaturalness in hearing.
