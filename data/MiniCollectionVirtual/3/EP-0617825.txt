<ABSTRACT>
A method for speeding up the perception and reading of written text (9), symbols, or corresponding marks. Vertical lines or sets of vertical lines are used on top of or in connection with the text/marks to be read so that words/parts of words or other marks are divided into adjacent groups, and that the distance of the vertical lines from each other is increased as the speed of reading and perception increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method and device for speeding up the perception and reading of written text, symbols, and corresponding marksThe present invention relates to a method for speeding up the perception and reading of written text, symbols, or correspon¬ ding marks.The targeted use is to eliminate the most common reading er¬ rors and bad reading habits of literate persons. These include reading aloud, regression and progression of the eyes, impre¬ cision and slowness of perception, and a narrow visual field.There is an increasing need for the invention, since more than 80 % of all information is in readable form. Furthermore, the amount of new information to be assimilated is increasing vig¬ orously. We no longer speak of a flood of information but of an information explosion. Studies have shown that, for examp¬ le, the information read by an employee during his or her wor¬ king hours will double within the next ten years. Even now, for example in Finland an employee uses on the average about one working hour daily for reading. This is more than 200 hours per year.The reading result does not meet today's requirements, because a majority of persons who know how to read have bad reading habits and downright reading errors, which hamper rapid and intensive reading.The users of the invention will be persons who read a great deal, for example for purposes of their work, hobbies, self development, or studies.By means of the invention it is possible to increase an avera¬ ge reader's reading speed by more than 50 %, and at the same time comprehension increases by about 10-20 %. 

A number of different methods have been used previously, and are still used, for eliminating reading errors and mainly for increasing the visual field. Most common of these methods are various courses and seminars and textbooks pertaining to the field. In the USA there was a boom of speed reading as early as the late 1950s. The best known very fast reader was John F. Kennedy, whose reading speed was at that time quoted as being about 1200 words a minute, whereas the speed of an average reader is about 150-200 words a minute.In Finland and in Sweden, seminars and courses in speed rea¬ ding were held about 10 years ago. A textbook on the subject has been published in Finnish: ARC - Tehokkaan Lukemisen Kurs- si (ARC - Advanced Reading Course), 1979, Mentran Ky. In addi¬ tion, some half a dozen books on speed reading have been writ¬ ten in Finnish.A computer aided instruction program called "Effective Rea¬ ding" was produced in 1989. The program is at present

Claims
1. A method for speeding up the perception and reading of written text (9) , symbols, or corresponding marks, character¬ ized in that vertical lines or sets of vertical lines are used on top of the text/marks Xo be read so that words/parts of words or other marks are divided into adjacent groups and that the distance of the vertical lines from each other is inc¬ reased as the speed of reading and perception increases.
2. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that transparencies (1-8) on which the vertical lines are located are placed on top of a written text (9) .
3. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that ver¬ tical lines are used on the screen of a computer or a corres¬ ponding device (Figure 10) in connection with a written text.
4. A method according to any of the above claims, characte¬ rized in that the distance of the lines relative to each other is greater on one side of the area to be read, i.e. on the side of the dominant eye, if one of the eyes is dominant (Fi¬ gures 8 and 9) .
5. A device for implementing the method according to any of the above claims, characterized in that the device is made up of a set of transparencies (1-8) each of which has vertical lines so that the transparency set has, for example, eight transparencies, the first (1) having eight adjacent vertical lines and the last (8) having one vertical line, the vertical lines in the transparencies dividing the text to be read into groups the width of which increases as the transparencies are replaced. 


6. A device according to Claim 5, characterized in that the transparency sets are available in different sizes and they can be selected according to the size of the area to be read. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 11 February 1994 (11.02.94); original claims 1 and 2 replaced by new claim 1; claims 3-6 replaced by new claims 2-5 (2 pages)]
1. A method for speeding up the perception and reading of written text (9) , symbols, or corresponding marks, wherein the vertical lines or sets of vertical lines are used on top of the text/marks to be read so that words/parts of words or other marks are divided into adjacent groups and that the distance of the vertical lines from each other is increased as the speed of reading and perception increases, characterized in that transparencies (1-8) on which the vertical lines are located are placed on top of a written text (9) .
2. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that vertical lines are used on the screen of a computer or a corresponding device (Figure 10) in connection with a written text (9) .
3. A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the distance of the lines relative to each other is greater on one side of the area to be read, i.e. on the side of the dominant eye, if one of the eyes is dominant
(Figures 8 and 9) .
4. A device for implementing the method according to any of the above claims, characterized in that the device is made up of a set of transparencies (1-8) each of which has vertical lines so that the transparency set has, for example, eight transparencies, the first (1) having eight adjacent vertical lines and the last (8) having one vertical line, the vertical lines in the transparencies dividing the text to be read into groups the width of which increases as the transparencies are replaced. 


5. A device according to Claim 4, characterized in that the transparency sets are available in different sizes and they can be selected according to the size of the area to be read.
