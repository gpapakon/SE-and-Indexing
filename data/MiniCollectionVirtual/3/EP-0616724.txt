<ABSTRACT>
Components such as pyroelectric sensors which are particularly sensitive to piezoelectric effects and can be adversely affected as a result by any mechanical stress or vibration are described. These adverse effects may be controlled by inserting a flexible silicone sheet (42) between the chip (10) bearing the pyroelectric film and the bottom of the package (30) so that it absorbs package distorsion without passing it on to the chip. Means are provided to enable connecting leads (34) to be ultrasonically welded even though the flexible sheet is present. The chip is preferably attached to a metallized ceramic wafer (40), and abutments (44) are preferably provided at the package bottom to limit compression of the flexible sheet (42) during the welding operation.

<CLAIMS>
Electronic component mounted in a package (30), 
comprising a monolithic integrated-circuit chip (10) 

attached by wires (34) which are bonded, on the one hand, 
to conducting areas (36) in the package and, on the other 

hand, to contact areas (14) on the chip, the package 
including a cavity on the bottom of which the chip is 

arranged, a layer (42) of an elastically deformable 
material, capable of absorbing the major part of the 

deformations of the package without transmitting them to 
the chip, being inserted between the bottom of the cavity 

and the chip, the chip moreover not being connected to 
the package by elements likely to transmit, to the chip, 

stresses, deformations or vibrations experienced by the 
package. 
Component according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the deformable layer is constituted by a flexible 

sheet, a few hundred microns in thickness, of a material 
such as silicone. 
Component according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the sheet is pierced with slots or holes distributed 

over its surface. 
Component according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the chip is cemented or bonded to 

a rigid plate (40) and in that the deformable layer is 
inserted between the plate and the bottom of the cavity 

of the package. 
Component according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the plate is a metallized ceramic plate or a plate 

of metal or of conducting metallic alloy. 
Component according to one of Claims 4 and 5,  
 

characterized in that the bottom of the cavity is provided 
with abutments (44) against which the plate can bear 

when a pressure is exerted on the latter in the direction 
of the bottom of the cavity, the height of the abutments 

being slightly less than the thickness of the deformable 
layer when no pressure is exerted on the latter. 
Component according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the difference between the height of the abutments 

and the thickness of the uncompressed deformable layer is 
sufficiently small for the layer to be able to be compressed 

by a tool during the bonding of the connecting 
wires, and sufficiently large for the plate not to come 

into contact with the abutments when the component is 
being used. 
Component according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the chip carries a pyroelectric 

layer and constitutes a pyroelectric image sensor. 
Method of mounting an electronic component in a 
package, characterized in that a sheet of flexible 

material is inserted between a chip and the bottom of a 
cavity formed in a package, and then connecting wires are 

bonded between the chip and the package. 
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the chip is firstly fixed to a rigid plate before 

inserting the flexible sheet between the plate and the 
bottom of the cavity. 
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that a pressure is exerted by a tool during the bonding 

operation, partially compressing the flexible sheet until 
the plate comes into contact with the abutments made at 

the bottom of the cavity, these abutments limiting the 
compression of the flexible sheet, and the bonding of the 

connecting wires is performed while the plate is in 
abutment. 
Method according to one of Claims 9 and 10, 
characterized in that the component is cooled during the 

bonding operation down to a temperature at which the 
flexible sheet is sufficiently rigid to permit the 

bonding operation.  
 
Method according to one of Claims 9 to 12, 
characterized in that the chip includes a pyroelectric 

layer and constitutes a pyroelectric image sensor.
