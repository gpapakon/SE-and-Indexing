<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a group modulator,
which is used in a digital radio communication system, for
providing a plurality of modulated signals based upon a
plurality of input data.In a mobile communication system, a cellular
communication system, and/or a personal communication
system, a base station must transmit a plurality of radio
signals simultaneously. The number of radio signals in
each base station is lately increasing because of increase
of traffic.Fig.1 shows a spectrum of modulated radio signals
which are transmitted simultaneously, where f1 through f5
are center frequency of each radio signal. The solid lines
f1, f3 and f4 show radio signal which is actually
modulated, and the dotted lines f2 and f5 show the status
that the modulated signals are not output.A digitally modulated signal which has a carrier
signal modulated with base band data signal in digital
form is produced by using a quadrature modurator which
receives in-phase component (I-channel signal) and
quadrature component (Q-channel signal).Fig.2 shows a block diagram of a prior modulator 
which provides a plurality of radio signals. In the
figure, the numerals 100, 101 and 102 show a modulator
which modulates a single input data, and 103 is an adder
for adding the outputs of all the modulators. The output
of the adder 103 is high frequency signal. As the
structure of the modulators 100 through 102 is the same as
one another, the modulator 100 is described in detail. The
modulator 100 has a mapping circuit 112 which receives an
input data #1, and provides I-channel signal and Q-channel
signal for quadrature modulation according to
instantaneous pattern of input data, and modulation
system. Those I-channel signal and Q-channel signal are
applied to the pulse shaping circuit 113 which restricts
bandwidth of those signal. The I-channel signal and the
Q-channel signal of the output of the pulse shaping
circuit 113 are then applied to the digital-to-analog
converters 131 and 132, respectively for the conversion of
the signal from digital form to analog form. The outputs
of the converters are applied to the mixers 151 and 152
which are a part of the quadrature modulator, through the
low pass filters 141 and 142, respectively. The oscillator
155 provides the carrier frequency f1 which is designated
by an external carrier designation signal #1. The carrier
frequency f1 of the oscillator 155 is applied to the mixer
or the multiplier 151 and the other mixer or the
multiplier 152 through the ¶/2 phase shifter 154. The
outputs of the
