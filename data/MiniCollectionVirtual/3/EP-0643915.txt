<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine and method for 
the continuous layering of strips of food material, more 
particularly for the continuous production of lasagne by 
forming strips of pasta in layers, inserting a filling 
between the layers and cutting into portions 
automatically. Normally, in the production of lasagne, the pasta is 
extruded, cut into strips of a suitable width, blanched, 
cut, and placed piece by piece into a tray by hand with a 
filling of sauce between the pieces. This process has the 
following disadvantages: 
1) The pasta processing line is unduly long and occupies 
a great deal of space.  2) The process is labour intensive and requires at least 
five people on the line.  3) The pasta is extremely slippery and difficult to 
handle. 4) There are losses of pasta as a result of a lack of 
time for the operator to transport all the pieces of 
pasta to the tray. 5) There are several moving parts in the machine for 
transporting and layering the pasta strips, which are 
prone to break down or wear out. A cake layering machine is known from US patent 3.670.655. US patent 4.569.849 describes a method for making lasagna. We have developed a machine and method for the continuous 
layering of strips of food material which occupies less 
than than half the length of a conventional machine, is 
labour saving, has no moving parts except for the basic 
conveyor which reduces or eliminates the costs for  
 
exchange of machine parts or possible shut-downs, and 
substantially prevents any losses in pasta. According to the present invention there is provided a machne 
for layering stripes of food material comprising 
a) means for forming a plurality of parallel strips of 
flexible food material, b) one lower conveyor belt (17) and at least one upper 
conveyor belt (14,15,16) extending from its upstream end 
lateral to the lower conveyor belt (17) to its downstream end 
overlying the lower conveyor belt (17), c) guiding means for guiding one stripe of flexible food 
material to the upstream end of the lower conveyor belt (17) 
and at least one other strip of flexible food material to the 
upstream end of an upper conveyor belt (14,15,16), d) power means adapted to advance the conveyor belts 
(14,15,16,17) and the strips downstream, and e) guiding means training a strip of flexible food material 
from the downstream end of an upper conveyor belt (14,15,16) 
to lie above another strip advancing downstream thereby 
forming a food product comprising layered stripes of the food 
material,
