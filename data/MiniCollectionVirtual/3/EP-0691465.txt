<ABSTRACT>
The detection system is used for the lambda probes for respective cylinder sets of an ic. engine employing separate catalysers and lambda regulation for each cylinder set. The fuel injection valves for at least one cylinder set are suppressed for the reaction or switching time of the lambda probes, with the lambda probe signal for the cut-out cylinder set compared with a threshold value at the end of this time and a side error indicated in dependence on this comparison. Pref. both lambda regulation systems are blocked when a side error is detected, with a fault display simultaneously activated. The testing can be effected via an external diagnosis device.

<CLAIMS>
A method of detecting when lambda sensors are connected to the wrong 
side of an internal combustion engine having two rows of cylinders each 

separately associated with an exhaust-gas catalyst comprising a lambda sensor 
connected to a lambda control unit, in which the injection valves can be 

switched off at least in one row of cylinders at a time, wherein
 
the injection valves (7) of one of the two rows (2, 4) of cylinders are switched 

off for a time at least equal to the reaction or change-over time of the lambda 
sensors (1, 5), at the end of the switching-off time of the injection valve (7), 

the signal (U
1
) from the lambda sensor (1) associated with the switched-off row 
(2) of cylinders is compared with a preset threshold value (S), and a connection 

of the lambda sensors (1, 5) to the wrong side is detected if the lambda sensor 
signal (U
1
) is above or below the threshold value (S). 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that if a connection of 
the lambda sensors (1, 5) to the wrong side is detected, the lambda control 

systems are blocked and a fault indicator is activated. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a connection 
of the lambda sensors (1, 5) to the wrong side is detected by using an external 

test device which can be connected to a diagnostic connection of the internal 
combustion engine. 
Use of the method according to the invention in claims 1 and 2 for on-board 
diagnosis in engine control devices.
