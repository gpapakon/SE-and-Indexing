<ABSTRACT>
A method of reducing the size of an image of a document page (200) is 
disclosed. The image is made up of a plurality of pixels which form rows and 

columns. Low information areas (205,210) in the image are identified. An overall 
percentage of size reduction of the image is determined. Up to a predetermined 

maximum percentage of each low information area (205,210) corresponding to the 
overall percentage of reduction is selectively removed so that the overall formatting 

of the document page is maintained in the reduced document page image (250).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of reducing
the size of an image of a document page.Electronic document systems are becoming increasingly popular for
storing reference materials. Conventional electronic document systems comprise a
scanner which scans an original document, digitizes each page of the document and
converts it into an image comprised of picture elements, or pixels; a computer for
processing the pixels and for performing any modifications to the image such as, but
not limited to, size reduction; and a monitor for viewing the scanned document. The
scanned documents are then stored for later retrieval.Electronic documents can be easily retrieved from a document system's
memory and viewed on a monitor. However, the amount of data contained in a
standard 8.5 x 11 inch document page significantly exceeds the amount of data
which can be viewed on a typical monitor. In particular, a standard image resolution
for document scanners is 300 pixels per inch (conventionally referred to as dots per
inch, or dpi). Thus, for an 8.5 x 11 inch document page, the scanned size is 2550 x
3300 pixels. The pixel dimensions of the screen of a conventional monitor are 1600
x 1280. Based on these measurements, it is evident that a full page cannot be
completely displayed on such a monitor.It is thus well known that if the entire document page is to be viewed on
the monitor, the amount of data contained in the document page must be reduced.
Indeed, one approach known in the prior art is to subsample the image in such a way
as to match the pixel dimensions of the subsampled image with those of the monitor
on which it is to be displayed. This approach, however, can result in a severe loss of
clarity, such as edge definition, and a noticeable reduction in the size of, for
example, text or other features. In the above illustration, for example, no less than
38% of the image data is lost. US-A-4,412,252, discloses a system which reduces the size of an image
by reducing the total information contained in the image. Specifically, the system
includes first and second reduction means which selectively delete dots, or pixels,
from each row and column of an image according to a predetermined proportion of
reduction for the entire image. To make such a reduction in each row and column,
the dots that represent the so-called non-essential information are first deleted, and if
the deletion of such non-essential dots does not reduce the row or column by the
predetermined proportion, then the information-bearing, or essential dots

<CLAIMS>
A method of reducing the size of an image of a document page (200)
by a determined overall percentage of reduction,

the image comprising a plurality of pixels which form rows and columns, the
document page (200) comprising a low information area (205,210) comprising at

least a selected one of blank margins, spaces between lines of text, border lines in
graphical images, table borders, white spaces and black spaces, the method being

characterized by:

selectively removing a fraction of said low information area (205,210)
from the document page (200), said fraction being no greater than said

overall percentage, before
reducing the

image by said determined overall percentage of reduction.
A method as claimed in claim 1 comprising the step of identifying the
low information area, said step of identifying comprising the steps of:


calculating an information sum for each row of pixels within the image
based on priority values assigned to each pixel in the row;
calculating an information sum for each column of pixels within the
image based on priority values assigned to each pixel in the column;
identifying a row or column having an information sum which exceeds a
first predetermined threshold value as a low information line;
identifying a row or column having an information sum which falls
below a second predetermined threshold as a low information line; and
identifying each group of adjacent low information lines as a low
information area.
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein said priority value for a first
pixel within a given row is based on a binary value of said first pixel within the row

and pixels located in corresponding positions in rows on respective sides of said
given row.
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein said priority value for a first
pixel within a given column is based on a binary value of said first pixel within the

column and pixels located in corresponding positions in columns on respective sides
of said given column. 
A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein said first predetermined
threshold value indicates the number of consecutive pixels having a high priority

value in said given row.
A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein said first predetermined
threshold value indicates the number of consecutive pixels having a high priority

value in said given column.
A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein said first predetermined
threshold value is at least 100 consecutive pixels having a high priority value.
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein said second predetermined
threshold value is approximately 60 consecutive pixels having a high priority value.
A method of reducing the image size of a scanned document page
comprising a plurality of pixels, by a determined overall percentage of reduction, each pixel being assigned a priority value, the

method comprising the steps of:

calculating an information sum for each row and column of the image
based on the sum of the priority values of the pixels in each row and column;
identifying blocks of at least two adjacent rows or columns having

information sums which fall below a predetermined threshold value; and
removing a number of the adjacent rows or columns by an amount
which is less than or equal to said percentage before performing the size reduction for the

overall image.
