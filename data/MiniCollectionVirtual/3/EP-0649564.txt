<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tap selector for an on-load tap changer, wherein the two tap selector shafts (3, 4) are made of metallic material and placed inside the current collector rings (22). The movable contacts (6, 7) of the selector are supported by the shafts (3, 4) via contact holders (8) of insulating material. Between each current collector ring (22) and the shafts (3, 4) an insulating ring (21) is arranged. The fixed contacts (11) of the selector are supported by an electrically insulating, circular hollow cylinder (9) with a closed circumference, the contacts (11) being fixed to the cylinder wall by axial upsetting. The cylinder (9) is provided with holes (10) for inspection and mounting. Each current collector ring (22) is connected by a screw joint to a current collector arm (24), which projects through a hole in the cylinder wall (9). Axial adjustment of the current collector arm (24) can be achieved by making the contact surfaces (25, 26) between the arm (24) and the ring (22) in the screw joint cylindrical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an on-load tap changer of 
the kind described in the preamble to claim 1. From DE-C-2 945 724 an on-load tap changer comprising a tap 
selector and a diverter switch is previously known, in which 
the support member for the movable contacts of the tap 
selector consists of two parallel rods of insulating 
material which are placed inside the current collector rings 
of the tap selector. The fixed contacts of the tap selector 
are mounted on insulating bars, which are arranged in 
parallel with and in a circle around the common axis of 
rotation of the two inner rods. The fixed contacts are fixed 
to the insulating bars by forming the end portion of the 
respective contact, after the contact has been placed in a 
through-hole in the bar, by transversal upsetting into a 
flat connection member which projects further out in the 
radial direction than does the hole. From DE-A-2 105 604 an off-circuit tapping switch is 
previously known, in which the fixed contacts are fixed by 
upsetting to a cylindrical tube provided with mounting and 
inspection openings. The object of the present invention is to provide a tap 
selector which has better electrical and mechanical properties 
than the above-mentioned design but which, in spite of 
this, is simpler and less expensive to manufacture. This is 
achieved by a tap selector with the characteristic features 
described in the claims. In a selector of the above-mentioned kind, it is advantageous 
for the dielectric strength if the current collector 
rings can be made with as small a diameter as possible. To 
achieve this, the two selector shafts, which in a tap selector 
according to the invention are placed inside the current 
collector rings, must at the same time be made as rigid as  
 
possible, both with respect to bending and torsion. This is 
achieved according to the invention by constructing the 
selector shafts from a metallic material, for example steel 
or aluminium. A sufficient electrical insulation (corresponding 
to one regulating step) between the current collector 
ring and the selector shafts is achieved with the aid of an 
intermediate insulating ring and with contact holders of 
insulating material. By fixing the fixed contacts by upsetting in the axial 
direction, a more reliable mounting is achieved than with 
the above-mentioned attachment by transversal upsetting 
without any extra fixing components being needed. By using as support member for the fixed contacts a circular 
insulating cylinder with a closed

<CLAIMS>
An on-load tap changer comprising a tap selector and a 
diverter switch, wherein the central part of the tap selector 

(1) comprises support members (3, 4) for movable selector 
contacts (6, 7) for achieving a connection between, on 

the one hand, fixed contacts (11) mounted in a circle on 
outer support members (9) and, on the other hand, current 

collector rings (22) which are electrically connected to the 
diverter switch and which surround said central support 

members (3, 4), wherein the fixed contacts (11) are arranged 
in through-holes in said outer support members (9) such that 

both end portions of each contact extend on both sides of 
the support member, one end portion forming a contact part 

(12) for cooperation with one of the movable contacts (6, 
7), the other end portion constituting connection member 

(16) for an electric conductor, 
characterized
 in that said 
central support members consist of two parallel shafts (3, 

4) of metallic material which can be individually rotated in 
steps around the centre line (5) of the central part and 

which individually support a number of the movable contacts 
(6, 7) via electrically insulating contact holders (8). 
An on-load tap changer according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that each current collector ring (22) is 
arranged between an insulating ring (21), which surrounds 

the two metal shafts (3, 4), and one of said contact holders 
(8). 
An on-load tap changer according to claim 2,
characterized
 in that the current collector ring (22) is 
provided with a connection projection (23), to which is 

screwed a current collector arm (24) which extends through a 
hole in the outer support member (9). 
An on-load tap changer according to claim 3,
characterized
 in that the connection projection (23) of 
the current collector ring (22) and the current collector  

 
arm (24) are formed with cylindrical contact surfaces (25, 

26) fitting each other. 
An on-load tap changer according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that said fixed contact (11) is 
formed with a central portion (14) which is adapted to the 

cross section of the through-hole and has a greater length 
than the wall thickness of the outer support member (9), and

member (9) by axially upsetting at least part of said 

central portion (14).
