<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a class of
fused imidazole and triazole derivatives which act on 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-HT) receptors, being selective
agonists of so-called "5-HT1-like" receptors. They are
therefore useful in the treatment of clinical conditions
for which a selective agonist of these receptors is
indicated.5-HT1-like receptor agonists which exhibit
selective vasoconstrictor activity have recently been
described as being of use in the treatment of migraine
(see, for example, A. Doenicke et al., The Lancet, 1988,
Vol. 1, 1309-11). The compounds of the present
invention, being selective 5-HT1-like receptor agonists,
are accordingly of particular use in the treatment of
migraine and associated conditions, e.g. cluster
headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, headache
associated with vascular disorders, tension headache and
paediatric migraine.EP-A-0313397 describes a class of indole derivatives which are
stated to be 5-HT agonists specific to a particular type of "5-HT1-like"
receptor and to be useful in medicine, particularly in the treatment of
migraine.WO-A-92/06973 also relates to indole derivatives which are alleged
to be potent 5-HT1 agonists useful in the treatment of a variety of
neurological disorders including migraine.EP-A-0200322 relates to a further class of indole derivatives
allegedly possessing dopaminergic antagonist and some 5-HT antagonist
activity, with potential utility in the treatment of psychic disorders,
especially psychoses, or cardiovascular diseases. The present invention provides a compound of
formula I, or a salt thereof:

wherein
Q represents the residue of a six-membered
heteroaromatic nucleus containing one
or two nitrogen atoms;A1 represents hydrogen;V represents nitrogen or C-A2;E represents a bond or a straight or branched
alkylene chain containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;F represents a group of formula FC:

in which
R1 represents -CH2.CHR4.NR6R7; and A2, R2, R3, R4, R6 and R7 independently
represent hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl.For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds
of formula I will be non-toxic pharmaceutically
acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in
the preparation of the compounds according to the
invention or of their non-toxic pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable
salts of the compounds of this invention include acid
addition salts which may, for example, be formed by
mixing a solution of the compound according to the
invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically
acceptable non-toxic acid
