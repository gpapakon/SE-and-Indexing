An ultrasonic method for the inspection of point 
welds between metal sheets, in which a high frequency test 

probe with a transducer diameter equal to the nominal 
diameter of the point weld to be inspected is coupled, 

with a lead section, to the sheets in the vicinity of the 
point weld and, using the pulse/echo method, the sheets 

are irradiated with ultrasonic signals and the echo pulse 
trains received are evaluated, characterized in that the 

frequency spectrum of the echo pulse trains is calculated 
and that for each measurement the spectral line 

corresponding to the overall-thickness travel time is 
examined on the one hand for sufficient minimum amplitude 

respectively energy density and on the other hand for 
sufficient minimum width respectively attenuation. 
A method according to Claim 1, further 
characterized in that before the calculation of the 

frequency spectra the echo pulse trains are rectified or 
preferably not rectified. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, further 
characterized in that for the optimization of the 

irradiation conditions of the test probe a threshold 
value (22) is established in the time-domain 

representation, corresponding to the A-image, for the 
first echo pulse corresponding to the total travel time, 

which must be surpassed. 
A method according to Claims 1 through 3, 
further characterized in that for the optimization of the 

irradiation conditions of the test probe spectral lines 
are observed in the frequency-domain representation, which 

are exclusively determined by the overall sheet thickness, 
making sure that the amplitude ratio of a higher order 

spectral line to a lower order spectral line is as high as 
possible; specifically in the case of two equally thick 

sheets, that the amplitude ratio of the third spectral 
line to the first spectral line is as high as possible.  

 
A method according to any of the Claims 1 
through 4, further characterized in that under 

predetermined irradiation conditions the frequency 
spectrum is only then calculated by a Fourier transform, 

when the amplitude of the first back-wall echo in the 
time-domain representation lies above a threshold 

value (22) and/or the echo pulse signals from the overall 
thickness show a monotonous decay, i.e. the amplitude of 

the n+1-th echo pulse is smaller than the n-th echo pulse 
in the time image. 
A method according to any of the Claims 1 
through 5, further characterized in that in the frequency-domain 

representation a threshold (26) is provided for a 
spectral line from a single-sheet travel time, which must 

not be surpassed for a good weld point. 
A method according to any of the Claims 1 
through 6, further characterized in that the amplitude 

ratio between the spectral line from the overall-thickness 
travel time and at least one spectral line from a single-sheet 

travel time is measured; specifically that the 
amplitude ratio of the spectral line from the single-sheet 

travel time, with which the threshold (26) is associated, 
and the first spectral line of the overall-thickness 

travel time is measured. 
A method according to any of the Claims 1 
through 7, further characterized in that a threshold (24) 

is established for a spectral line from the overall-sheet-thickness 
travel time in the frequency domain, which 

indicates the existence of adequate irradiation 
conditions. 
A method according to any of the Claims 1 
through 8, further characterized in that the spectral line 

from the overall-thickness travel time is monitored for a 
certain maximal width. 
A method according to any of the Claims 1  
 

through 9, further characterized in that a data reduction 
is performed to facilitate the computation of the Fourier 

transform. 
A method according to any of the Claims 1 
through 10, further characterized in that tapering is 

performed at the beginning and at the end of the selected 
time interval to avoid artificial frequency lines. 
A method according to Claim 1, further 
characterized in that the first spectral line is examined.
