<ABSTRACT>
A gas generant composition adapted for use with 
airbag restraint systems containing aluminum components 

includes a fuel which is a tetrazole or a triazole, an 
oxidizer which is an ammonium, alkali metal and/or alkaline 

earth metal salt of a chlorate, perchlorate or nitrate, 
alumina and a binder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to gas generant
compositions suitable for automotive air bag restraint
systems, particularly restraint systems in which the gas
generant is encased in aluminum housing and/or generates
gases which come into contact with aluminum components,
such as filters.Most automotive air bag restraint systems,
presently in use, use gas generant compositions in which
sodium azide is the principal fuel. Because of
disadvantages with sodium azide, particularly instability
in the presence of metallic impurities and toxicity, which
presents a disposal problem for unfired gas generators,
there is a desire to develop non-azide gas generant systems
and a number of non-azide formulations have been proposed.
However, to date, non-azide gas generants have not made
significant commercial inroads.US-A-5,139,588
describes gas
generant compositions which use as fuel tetrazole and
triazole compounds such as aminotetrazole, tetrazole,
bitetrazole, 1,2,4-triazole-5-one,
3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole-5-one and metal salts thereof. The
formulations further contain oxidizers, including alkaline
and alkaline earth metal salts of nitrates, chlorates and
perchlorates. This patent teaches that the cations of the
fuel and oxidizer salts should include a mixture of
alkaline and alkaline earth metal cations, whereby the
salts formed during combustion include both liquid and
solid salts that together form filterable clinkers.
Furthermore, the compositions of this patent include
materials such as silicon dioxide, boric oxide and vanadium 
pentoxide which reacts with corrosive oxides, such as
potassium or sodium oxide, forming mixed metal salts.It is noted in US-A-5,139,588 that the
compositions are useful in aspirator systems. These
systems, which are generally no longer used, were typically
made of steel. Space, cost and weight requirements of the
present day automotive industry generally require small
aluminum units in which the gas is provided entirely by the
gas generant, not by venturi action in conjunction with gas
generation. While an aluminum housing and other aluminum
components have the advantages of being lightweight and
easily machined, and therefore inexpensive to produce,
aluminum has the disadvantage of being a highly reactive
metal, e.g., as compared to steel. In particular, aluminum
is rapidly degraded by alkali metal oxides such as Na2O and
K2O, particularly at high temperatures. Gas generant
compositions based on azoles, as in US-A-5,139,588,
burn at much higher temperatures than do sodium
