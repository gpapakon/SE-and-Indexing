<ABSTRACT>
A cover (10) for an air bag module (11) includes a hinge 
formation (15) having a first hinge member (16) adapted 

to be secured to a cover panel (12) and a second hinge 
member (17) connected to a suitable support structure. 

The first and second hinge members (16,17) have abutment 
means (30,22) which will engage one another when the 

cover panel (12) is in a closed position, a shear element 
(21) is associated with one of the hinge members (16) and 

engages a formation (23) on the other hinge member (17), said 
shear element (21) retaining the cover panel (12) in 

said closed position and being adapted to shear upon a 
load being applied to the cover panel (12) upon inflation 

of the air bag, to permit the cover panel (12) to pivot 
about the hinge formation (15) to an open position, 

thereby permitting deployment of the air bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in or 
relating to air bag restraint systems. In air bag restraint systems for vehicles, the air bags 
are located behind covers formed in trim panels, so that 
upon inflation of the air bag, the bag will burst through 
the cover and be deployed in front of the occupant of the 
vehicle. It is desirable that such covers remain closed until the 
air bag is deployed, in order to avoid the possibility 
that the air bag may be interfered with which may lead to 
malfunctioning, when the need for deployment of the air 
bag arises. Hitherto this has been achieved by having a 
hinge formation along one edge of the cover and a 
frangible seam along an opposite edge of the cover. With 
this form of construction, the cover must be attached to 
an element defining a hinge formation and a frangible 
seam, which must then be secured along the opposite edges 
to support members. This must be done without disrupting 
the frangible seam and in the past it has been proposed 
to use a sub-frame, to which the cover may be secured 
prior to assembling it into the vehicle, the cover being 
located in position in the vehicle by means of the sub-frame. According to one aspect of the present invention, a cover 
for an air bag module of an air bag restraint system 
includes a hinge formation, the hinge formation 
comprising first and second hinge members pivotally 
connected together, the first hinge member being adapted 
to be secured to a cover panel and the second hinge 
member being adapted to be connected to a suitable 
support structure; characterised in that the first and 
second hinge members have abutment means which will  
 
engage one another when the cover panel is in a closed 
position, a shear element being associated with one of 
said hinge members, the shear element engaging a 
formation on the other hinge member, the shear element 
retaining the cover panel in said closed position and 
being adapted to shear upon a load being applied to the 
cover panel upon inflation of the air bag, to permit the 
cover panel to pivot about the hinge formation to an open 
position, to permit deployment of the air bag. In accordance with the present invention, the cover panel 
is only secured along one edge, the shear element 
associated with the hinge formation maintaining the cover 
panel in its closed position until the air bag is 
inflated. Location of the shear element on the hinge 
will also increase the leverage applied to the shear 
element when the air bag is inflated,

<CLAIMS>
A cover (10) for an air bag module (11) of an air 
bag restraint system including a hinge formation (15), 

the hinge formation (15) comprising first and second 
hinge members (16, 17) pivotally connected together, the 

first hinge member (16) being adapted to be secured to a 
cover panel (12) and the second hinge member (17) being 

adapted to be connected to a suitable support structure; 
characterised in that the first and second hinge members 

(16, 17) have abutment means (31, 22) which will engage 
one another when the cover panel (12) is in a closed 

position, a shear element (21) being associated with one 
of said hinge members (16), the shear element (21) 

engaging a formation (23) on the other hinge member (17), 
the shear element (21) retaining the cover panel (12) in 

said closed position and being adapted to shear upon a 
load being applied to the cover panel (12) upon inflation 

of the air bag, to permit the cover panel (12) to pivot 
about the hinge formation (15) to an open position, to 

permit deployment of the air bag. 
A cover (10) according to Claim 1 characterised in 
that the shear element (21) is arranged such that upon 

shearing, the parts of the shear element (21) will be 
retained in or behind the hinge assembly (15). 
A cover (10) according to Claim 1 or 2 characterised 
in that the shear element (21) comprises an integral 

formation on the first hinge member (16), said formation 
(21) engaging a complimentary formation (23) on the 

second hinge member (17) when the cover panel (12) is in 
its closed position. 
A cover (10) according to Claim 3 characterised in 
that the first and second hinge members (16, 17) have web 

portions (19,23) which are interconnected by pivot means 
 

(25, 26, 27), a web formation (21) being provided on the 
first hinge member (16) which extends parallel to but is 

spaced from the web portion (19) thereof, the web portion 
(23) the second member (17) engaging between the web 

portion (19) and web formation (21) on the first member 
(16), so that engagement of the web portion (23) on the 

second member (17) with the web formation (21) of the 
first member (16) will prevent the cover panel (12) from 

being pivoted from its closed to its open position, the 
web formation (21) being adapted to shear when a load is 

applied to the cover panel (12) by inflation of the air 
bag. 
A cover (10) according to Claim 4 characterised in 
that screw adjustment means (31) on one hinge member (16) 

abuts the other hinge member (17) when the cover panel 
(12) is in its closed position. 
A cover (10) according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the first and second hinge 

members (16, 17) are formed from extrusions. 
A cover (10) according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the shear element (21) is 

tuned to shear when a predetermined load is applied to 
the cover panel (12) upon inflation of the air bag. 
A cover (10) according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the hinge assembly (15) is 

adjustably mounted with respect to the vehicle. 
A cover (10) according to claim 8 characterised in 
that the second hinge member (17) is connected to a 

support structure by means of a pair of end brackets 
(14), the body portion (22) of the second hinge member 

(17) being slidably located in slots (35) in the end 
brackets (14) for forward/rearward movement thereof, 

 
adjustable means (36, 37) being provided to locate the 

body portion (22) in the slots (35) in the 
forward/rearward direction.
