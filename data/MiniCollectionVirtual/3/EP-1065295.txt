<ABSTRACT>
A processing chamber cleaning method is described which utilizes microwave energy
to remotely generate a reactive species to be used alone or in combination with an inert gas to

remove deposits from a processing chamber. The reactive species can remove deposits from a
first processing region at a first pressure and then remove deposits from a second processing

region at a second pressure. Also described is a cleaning process utilizing remotely generated
reactive species in a single processing region at two different pressures. Additionally,

different ratios of reactive gas and inert gas may be utilized to improve the uniformity of the
cleaning process, increase the cleaning rate, reduce recombination of reactive species and

increase the residence time of reactive species provided to the processing chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods and apparatuses suitable for removing
accumulated processing by-products and unwanted deposits within processing reactors. More
particularly, this invention relates to a method for cleaning the internal components of a wafer
processing apparatus after the deposition of Tantalum containing films, such as Tantalum
Pentaoxide (Ta2O5). Additionally, the method described is suitable for removing deposits
formed by other processes useful in the manufacture of semiconductor devices and flat panel
displays.The desire for greater capacity integrated circuits (ICs) on smaller sized devices has
increased interest in replacing today's 64 megabit DRAM with memory devices in the range
of 256 megabit, 1 gigabit and higher. This need for increased capacity on the same or smaller
substrate footprint device makes it necessary to replace conventional dielectric films
previously used in stacked capacitor formation, such as silicon dioxide (SiO2), with dielectric
films having higher dielectric constants. Capacitors containing high-dielectric constant
materials, such as Ta2O5, usually have much larger capacitance densities than standard SiO2-Si3N4-SiO2
stack capacitors making them the materials of choice in IC fabrication. High
dielectric constant films allow smaller capacitor areas which in turn enable closer spacing of
transistors and increased transistor density. One material of increasing interest for stack
capacitor fabrication is Tantalum Pentaoxide which has a relative dielectric constant more
than six times that of SiO2. Accompanying the increased and expanding use of this material is
a need for improved in-situ methods of removing unwanted deposits which accumulate within
the processing chamber after repeated deposition cycles.An available cleaning method involves the utilization of a remote plasma generator to
produce reactive species which are delivered to the processing chamber. U.S. Patent No.
5,449,411 issued September 12, 1995, to Hitachi describes a process for cleaning a vacuum 
chamber prior to the deposition of SiO2 therein. A microwave plasma of process gases such as
C2F6, CF4, CHF3, CH6, F2, HF, Cl2 or HCl is described. The patent further describes that the
cleaning process can be improved by applying an R.F. electric field to electrodes in the
chamber.U.S. Patent 5,778,788 issued August 4, 1998, to Applied Komatsu Technology,
describes a method for cleaning a deposition chamber that is used in fabricating electronic
devices by activating a precursor gas using
