<DESCRIPTION>
This invention belongs to the fields of
pharmaceutical chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry,
and provides an asymmetric process for the synthesis of a
key intermediate in the preparation of duloxetine, (+)-N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine,
hydrochloric acid salt.Duloxetine is a pharmaceutical now under
development as an anti-depressant. It inhibits the uptake
of both norepinephrine and serotonin and is presently in
clinical evaluation. The compound was disclosed in U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,023,269 and 4,956,388 by Robertson, etal.,
and the synthesis of it was discussed in more detail by
Deeter, etal., in Tetrahedron Letters, 31(49), 7101-04
(1990). The process for preparing duloxetine is there
outlined as follows. 
The product of Step D above, when in the
hydrochloride salt form, is duloxetine.The present invention provides improved
conditions for carrying out Step C in the above scheme,
whereby the product of Step C is obtained more quickly in
better purity and yield than has previously been possible.A particularly useful salt for the isolation of
the intermediate is also provided. The present invention provides a process for
preparing (S)-(+)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine
comprising reacting
(S)-(-)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(2-thienyl)-3-hydroxypropanamine with sodium
hydride, potassium benzoate or potassium acetate, and 1-fluoronaphthalene
in an organic solvent; and if desired,
recovering the product as the phosphoric acid salt. The
phosphoric acid salt is also an aspect and an embodiment of
the invention.The present invention provides an asymmetric
process for preparing the specific enantiomer shown above
as the product of Step C in the scheme. It is named as the
(S)-(+) enantiomer and that nomenclature will be used
throughout this document. The starting material for the
process of this invention, the hydroxypropanamine, is named
as the (S)-(-) enantiomer.The preferred solvent for carrying out the present
invention is dimethylsulfoxide. Other solvents, such as
dimethylformamide or pyridine, may be used as
well. The process may be effectively carried out at
unusually high concentrations, such as from 0.5-1.0
molar, preferably 0.6-0.9 molar. However, the rate and 
yield of the process is not seriously affected by the
concentration, so long as the solubility limit is not
exceeded, of course.The order and manner of combining the reactants
are not important and may be varied. The reactants may be
added to the reaction mixture as solids, or may be
dissolved
