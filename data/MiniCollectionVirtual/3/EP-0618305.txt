Method of producing patterns on substrates (50) by local 
coating of the substrates (50) with a resist medium and 

by the subsequent application of at least one functional 
layer, characterised in that a pattern support (10) is 

provided with a recessed pattern corresponding to the 
pattern to be produced, the spatial distribution of the 

recesses (42, 42', 42'', ...) corresponding to the surface 
areas of the substrate (50) not to be coated, in that the 

recesses (42, 42', 42'', ...) are filled with the vapour 
of a resist medium and the substrate (50) moves 

substantially synchronously with the pattern support 
(10), which comes into contact with the substrate (50) 

with the open sides of the recesses facing the substrate 
surface, thus causing the vapour contained in the 

recesses to condense against the substrate (50), and in 
that finally, when at least part of this vapour has 

condensed, the substrate (50) is provided with at least 
one functional layer. 
Apparatus for producing metal-free stripes on 

vacuum-coated foil strips (50), in particular for 
capacitors, consisting of a housing (32), having a lid 

(39) for pressure-tight closure of the housing and a 
winding device (29) with rotatably mounted deflecting and 

tension rollers (5 to 9 or 11 to 17), at least one 
coating roller (18), and a winding and unwinding roller 

(35', 37'), as well as a coating source (19) held in the 
housing (32), and a vessel (34) for receiving a 

separating medium, e.g. an oil, and having at least one 
discharge nozzle (36) for discharging the separating 

medium to be vaporised from the vessel (34), 
characterised in that the coating roller (18) is 

connected upstream of a pattern support (10) with a 
recessed pattern (42), the open sides of the recesses 

being oriented towards the discharge nozzle (36) and the 
pattern support (10) being movable synchronously with the 

foil strip (50) and coming into contact therewith, and  
 

with a scraper or sealing strip (47 and 43, 44 
respectively) which enclose the evaporated separating 

medium in the recessed pattern (42) or retain the surplus 
separating medium vapour in a chamber (39, 55) in which 

the evaporator (34) is disposed. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
discharge nozzle (36) is formed as a slot or row of 

holes, and the separating medium vapour discharged 
therefrom enters a chamber (39, 55) defined on one side 

by the pattern support (10) and on the other side by wall 
members (40, 41, 41', 56, 57) which are sealed with 

respect to the pattern support (10) by means of sealing 
strips or sealing lips (47, 43, 44) directly abutting 

said pattern support or forming a narrow gap therewith, 
the chamber (39, 55) having a higher pressure than the 

adjacent chamber (45). 
Apparatus according to claims 2 and 3, characterised in 
that the sealing strips or sealing lips (43, 44) are 

pressed against the pattern supports (10) by means of 
resilient members, e.g. springs (46, 54) or magnets. 
Apparatus according to claims 2 to 4, characterised in 
that the foil strip (50) is partly wrapped round the 

pattern support (10) formed as a roller. 
Apparatus according to claims 2 to 4, characterised in 
that the foil strip (50) is guided past the gap (b) 

defined by the sealing strips (43, 44) with narrow 
clearance (c) from the pattern support (10).
