<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for automatically creating and maintaining driver activity logs for vehicle operators. The vehicle operator is in communication with a central station using a mobile communication terminal located onboard an assigned vehicle. A vehicle operator driving status is determined at the central station when messages and position reports are transmitted from the vehicle to the central station. A driver activity log is created upon request by the vehicle operator or by authorized personnel at the central station or host facility. The driver activity log may then be transmitted to the vehicle for display.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PAPERLESS LOG SYSTEM AND METHODBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONI. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to the transportation industry and more particularly to a method and apparatus for automatically creating and maintaining driver activity logs for vehicle operators.II. Description of the Related ArtTruck drivers across the United States presently operate under regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The DOT and FHWA regulate many aspects of the transportation industry ranging from vehicle maintenance to substance abuse. One of the more important areas that the DOT and FHWA monitor is the occurrence of truck-related accidents and ways to reduce the number of such accidents. Driver fatigue has been cited by the DOT and FHWA as being one of the primary causes of truck-related accidents. Consequently, the FHWA has adopted regulations that limit the number of hours that truck drivers may operate a vehicle over a given time period. For example, the DOT prohibits any driver from driving a commercial vehicle in excess of 10 hours after 8 hours of rest.To ensure compliance with these safety regulations, the FHWA also requires drivers to keep detailed written records of the number of hours driving, on-duty but not driving, resting, and off-duty. Drivers must provide daily updates into a logbook carried with the driver, detailing the number of hours spent in each of the four categories mentioned above. Other information may be required as well, such as the location of where the log book entry occurred, a vehicle identification number, the name of the nearest city at the time of a logbook entry, and so on. A driver must make entries into the log book each time he/she begins driving, stops driving, starts or ends an "on-duty but not operating the vehicle" state, and starting or ending a "rest" state. Drivers must chart their hours and activities every day by drawing lines on a 

grid in the log book and calculating the number of hours driving, on-duty but not driving, resting, and off duty, over a twenty four hour period.Federal officials periodically inspect driver logbooks at weigh stations and other locations to certify that they have been kept up-to-date by the driver, and that the driver is following the FHWA mandated regulations. If a driver is found to be out of compliance with the FHWA regulations, he or she will not be permitted to continue driving until the proper amount of off-duty or rest time has elapsed.

CLAIMS
1. A method for creating and maintaining a driver activity log for a vehicle operator, said vehicle operator in communication with a central station using a mobile communication terminal located onboard a vehicle, said driver activity log showing the elapsed time that said vehicle operator has spent in each of several vehicle operator driving states, the method comprising the steps of: transmitting a message from said vehicle to said central station, said message comprising a message type; determining a current vehicle location and a current date and time that said current vehicle position was determined and providing said current vehicle location and said current date and time to said central station; and determining a current vehicle operator driving state from said several vehicle operator driving states using said message type, said current vehicle position, said current date and time, a previous vehicle position, and a previous date and time that said previous vehicle position was determined.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of: creating a current log record based upon said current vehicle operator driving state and a previous log record in a storage device; modifying said previous log record based upon said current vehicle operator driving state and said previous log record in said storage device; and storing said log records in said storage device.
3. The method of claim 2 further comprising the steps of: creating said driver activity log, using said log records, upon receipt of a driver activity log request, said driver activity log showing the elapsed time that said vehicle operator has spent in each of said several vehicle operator driving states; and providing said driver activity log to an output device.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the step of providing said driver activity log to an output device comprises the steps of: transmitting said driver activity log from said central station to said vehicle; receiving said driver activity log at said vehicle; and 


 providing said driver activity log to said output device.
5. The method of claim 3 wherein the step of providing said driver activity log to an output device comprises the steps of: providing said driver activity log from said central station to a telephonic interface as specified by said driver log activity request; transmitting said driver activity log from said telephonic interface to a remote facsimile device as specified by said driver activity log request.
6. The method of claim 2 wherein said current log record comprise said vehicle operator driving state, a start time, an end time, and an elapsed time that said vehicle operator has been in said current vehicle operator driving state.
7. An apparatus for creating and maintaining a driver activity log for a vehicle operator, said vehicle operator in communication with a central station using a mobile communication terminal located onboard a vehicle, said driver activity log showing the elapsed time that said vehicle operator has spent in each of several vehicle operator driving states, comprising: a transceiver located at said central station for receiving a message from said vehicle, said message comprising a message type; a position location device for determining a current location of said vehicle; a timer for determining a current date and time that said current vehicle position was determined; a storage device for storing said current vehicle position, said current date and time, a previous vehicle position, and a previous date and time that said previous vehicle position was determined; and a processor connected to said transceiver for determining a current vehicle operator driving state based on said message type, said current vehicle position, said current date and time, a previous vehicle position, and a previous date and time that said previous vehicle position was determined.
