<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connecting device for connecting a first profile part (1) to a transverse part (10) which runs transversely with respect to said first profile part and is supported, by an end side (13), against a longitudinal side (14) of the first profile part (1). On the longitudinal side (14) directed towards the transverse part (10), the first profile part (1) exhibits an anchorage groove (3), which extends in the longitudinal direction. A connecting element (22), on the one hand, is fixed or can be fixed on the transverse part (10) and, on the other hand, interacts with at least one tension element (24, 24') of a tension device (23) which is anchored in the anchorage groove (3) of the first profile part (1). In the case of loading effected essentially in the longitudinal direction (28) of the anchorage groove (3), the tension element (24, 24') exerts, on to the connecting element (22), a tensile force which is directed transversely with respect to said loading and draws the transverse part (10), with the end side (13) in front, in the direction of the first profile part (1).

<CLAIMS>
Connection device for sections which may be used for the
construction of tables, shelves, stands or the like, for

connecting a first section (1) with a cross-piece (10) running
at right-angles to the former, with one end face (13) resting

against a long side (14) of the first section (1) and in
particular formed by a second section (2), wherein the first

section (1) has on its long side (14) facing the cross-piece (10)
an axially-extending anchorage slot (3), and wherein there is

provided on the cross-piece (10) a fixed or fixable connection
element (22) with a force transfer section (25) on opposite sides

of which may act two tension elements (24, 24') braceable
relative to one another by means of a clamping element (32) along

the axis of the anchorage slot (3) and forming part of a
tensioning device (23) anchored or anchorable in the anchorage

slot (3) of the first section (1), in order to exert on the
connection element (22) a tensile force drawing the cross-piece

(10) - with the end face (13) leading - towards the first section
(1), characterized in that each of the two tension elements (24,

24') is arranged altogether on opposite sides of the force
transfer section (25), while the clamping element (32) acting on

the two tension elements (24, 24') is guided past on the end face
of the connection element (22) facing the slot base of the

anchorage slot (3).
Connection device according to claim 1, characterized in that
there is provided in the pressure contact zone between the

tension elements (24, 24') and the force transfer section (25)
on one or more of the two parts (24, 24'; 25) a shearing face

(33, 35) facing the other part concerned (25; 24, 24') and
running at an angle relative to a reference plane running at

right-angles to the longitudinal axis (28) of the anchorage slot
(3) in such a way that the compressive force exerted by the

tension elements (24, 24') is converted into a tensile force
acting towards the base of the anchorage slot (3). 
Connection device according to claim 2, characterized in that
the force transfer section (25) has two first shearing faces

(33), each lying flat against a second shearing face (35) of the
respectively assigned tension element (24, 24').
Connection device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that each shearing face (33, 35) is so inclined that, as it

approaches the slot base, it moves increasingly away from the
axis of tension (34) of the connection element (22) running at

right-angles to the longitudinal direction (28) of the anchorage
slot (3).
Connection device according to any of claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that each shearing face (33, 35) is designed as

a smooth shearing face.
Connection device according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the clamping element (32) is a threaded

component, in particular formed by a bolt (36), capable of
resting on one tension element (24) while being in screwed

connection with the other tension element (24').
Connection device according to any of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the force transfer section (25) is at least

partially recessed in the anchorage slot, wherein expediently it
does not dip at all or else dips only slightly into an anchorage

section (8) of the anchorage slot (3) adjacent to the slot neck
(7) of the anchorage slot (3).
Connection device according to any of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the connection element (22) has a fastening

section (26), in particular in the form of a threaded section,
for fastening to the cross-piece (10) and provided in particular

with a locating recess (15) or other locating device with which
the fastening section (26) can interact. 
Connection device according to claim 8, characterized in that
the connection element (22) is in the form of a screw, and has

a head forming the force transfer section (25).
Connection device according to any of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the force transfer section (25) has a flat

shape such that it may be inserted in the anchorage slot (3) in
the direction of the subsequent axis of tension (34).
Connection device according to any of claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the tension elements (24, 24') are guided

in the anchorage slot (3) with longitudinal movement facility and
have in particular a structure comparable to a sliding block.
Connection device according to any of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that the tension elements (24, 24') are in

particular block-shaped and have on that end face which is
towards the force transfer section (25) a recess (48), serving

to hold an end section (49) of the force transfer section (25),
with an internal base facing the force transfer section (25)

which expediently forms the shearing face (35) where provided.
Connection device according to any of claims 1 to 12,
characterized in that one or more of the tension elements (24,

24') is designed as an anchorage element for anchoring the
tensioning device (23) in the assigned anchorage slot (3).
