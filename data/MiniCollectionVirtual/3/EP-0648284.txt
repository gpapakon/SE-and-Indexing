<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for fabricating thin films having optical properties, the aim of the invention being to provide a method for treating particularly planar substrates of large dimensions and possibly non-circular shape. This objective is achieved by means of a method comprising the preparation of a colloidal suspension (2, 2') and depositing the suspension on a substrate (8) by means of a coating cylinder (22). This invention enables particularly the manufacture of dielectric mirrors and non-reflecting films.

Process for the production of thin films (26) 
having optical properties, characterized in that it 

consists of the following stages: 

preparing at least one colloidal suspension (2, 
2') comprising colloids (4, 4') giving said optical 

properties, dispersed in a solvent (6, 6'), said colloidal 
suspension having a viscosity between 1 and 5 mPaÂ·s, 
placing the substrate (8) to be covered with the 
thin film on a support (18), 
introducing said colloidal suspension (2, 2') 
under pressure into a coating cylinder (22), 
displacing said cylinder (22) in translation and 
at constant speed below the surface (12) to be treated of 

the substrate (8), so that the meniscus (24) of the 
colloidal suspension (2, 2') formed on the periphery of the 

coating cylinder (22) ensures the deposition of a thin film 
(26) of a colloidal nature on the surface (12) of said 

substrate (8), 
also displacing in translation and following the 
passage of the coating cylinder (22), a mask (28), parallel 

to the plane of the surface (12) of the substrate (8), 
allowing the thus covered substrate (8) to dry. 
Production process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the displacement speed of the coating 

cylinder (22) is between approximately 1 and 10 mm per 
second. 
Production process according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the coating cylinder (22) is provided 

with a longitudinal slit along one of its generatrixes. 
Production process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the coating cylinder (22) is a microporous 

cylinder. 
Production process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that use is made of means (30) for  

 
breaking the meniscus (24) at the end of the deposition of 

the thin film (26) on the substrate (8). 
Production process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that prior to depositing the colloidal 

suspension (2, 2'), the substrate (8) is cleaned with the 
aid of an aqueous detergent solution or an ethanol 

solution. 
Production process according to claim 6, 
characterized in that the substrate (8) is inorganic and in 

that following the cleaning stage, the substrate (8) is 
exposed to an ultraviolet ray treatment in the presence of 

ozone. 
Production process according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that it consists of 

depositing a colloidal suspension (2) incorporating 
colloids of silicon oxide dispersed in an aliphatic 

alcohol. 
Production process according to claim 8, 
characterized in that on the substrate (8) is deposited a 

silicone coating before making the deposit of the thin film 
(26) of silicon oxide. 
Production process according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it consists of 

alternatively depositing a first colloidal suspension (2) 
comprising colloids (4) chosen from among silicon oxide, 

calcium fluoride or magnesium fluoride and dispersed in a 
solvent (6) and a second colloidal suspension (2') comprising 

colloids (4') chosen from among aluminium oxide, 
titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, thorium 

oxide, tantalum oxide, niobium oxide, yttrium oxide, 
scandium oxide or lanthanum oxide and dispersed in a 

solvent (6'). 
Production process according to claim 10, 
characterized in that the solvent (6, 6') is chosen from 

among saturated aliphatic alcohols of formula ROH, in which 
R represents an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.  

 
Production process according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it consists of introducing 

into a coating cylinder (22) and then successively 
depositing by means of said cylinder an adhesion promoting 

coating formed from a material chosen from among silanes,

coated with a siloxane binder, a coupling agent coating 
formed from a material chosen from among silazanes and an 

anti-abrasive coating of a fluorine polymer.

claims 8 to 12, characterized in that the deposited films
