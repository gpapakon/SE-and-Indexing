<ABSTRACT>
Circuitry and techniques designed to allow stable and continuous delivey of alternating power to a processing plasma with switch-mode power supply (16) include a variety of embodiments. Parallel, series, and other circuit elements connected across switching element (7) are tuned so that energy at other than the fundamental frequency is absorbed and dissipated. This energy may be only at the second harmonic or it may be across broad frequency ranges through selecting high impedance at the fundamental frequency and relatively low impedance at other frequencies. In overcoming instabilities, oscillations, and even changing class of operation of the switch-mode power supply, the stabilizing element absorbs the energy to avoid allowing it to affect switch (7) of power supply (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the delivery of 
power through an alternating current to a processing plasma such 
as is used in thin film processing. Specifically, the invention 
focuses upon overcoming the occurrence of oscillations and 
instabilities often encountered when power is supplied by a 
switch-mode power supply. The technique of material processing through the utilization 
of plasmas has been known for many years. In one application, it 
may involve the production of thin films on a surface through the 
action of the plasma, while in another it may involve the etching 
of those same films, also through the action of the plasma. In 
recent years the commercial demand for the equipment involved has 
increased significantly as its application to the creation of 
microchips and other semiconducting devices has been refined. 
Basically the technique involves the ignition and maintenance of 
a processing plasma through the application of electric power to 
the plasma. The plasma then interacts with gases introduced and 
the surfaces involved to effect the processing desired. A potentially important characteristic of the field involved 
is that this field has evolved with a primary focus upon the 
plasma itself, not the circuitry involved. Although those skilled 
in the art have long desired certain refinements in electrical 
circuitry and capabilities, the suppliers of AC power generation 
equipment and handling equipment for plasma processing have 
generally applied techniques long known in the communication 
field, without always recognizing the differences between the 
nonlinear plasma load and the linear antenna (the usual load for 
communications equipment). While plasma-oriented physicists and 
chemists have greatly expanded the understanding of the processes 
involved, advancements with respect to the alternating power 
supplied and the circuits involved have not occurred to the same 
degree.  
 As those skilled in the art have come to understand, the 
nature of the processing plasmas being utilized does not easily 
lend itself to modeling as a simple circuit element in an AC 
circuit. Rather, with even detailed circuit knowledge, the 
inclusion of a plasma in an AC circuit is inherently difficult. 
This is because in most processing environments the plasma acts 
not just as an active element that is, one whose characteristics 
depend upon other system parameters such as gas pressure and 
temperature but it also acts as a highly nonlinear and dynamic 
element. As a nonlinear
