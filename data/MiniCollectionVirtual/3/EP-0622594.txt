<ABSTRACT>
A compressor (21), an outdoor heat exchanger (23), an electric expansion valve (25) through which a 
refrigerant flows in the opposite directions, and an indoor heat exchanger (31) are connected to form a reversely 

operable refrigerant circuit (1). Between the electric expansion valve (25) and indoor heat exchanger (31), a refrigerant 
regulator (4) is provided which is adapted to regulate a circulation rate of a refrigerant during a room heating operation 

cycle. The refrigerant regulator (4) is provided with a first outflow/inflow pipe (42) to which the outdoor heat exchanger 
(23) is connected, a plurality of refrigerant ports (45, 45, ...), and a second outflow; inflow pipe (43) to which the 

indoor heat exchanger (31) is connected. An opening action control means (73) is also provided which is adapted to 
control the opening of the electric expansion valve (25) to a high level when the pressure HP of the high-pressure 

refrigerant in the refrigerant circulating circuit (1) has reached predetermined level. This enables an accumulator to be 
omitted, the permissible range of charge of refrigerant to be increased, and an increase in the pressure of high-pressure 

refrigerant to be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air conditioner reversibly operatable between a cooling
operation cycle and a heating operation cycle and particularly to measures for simplifying
a refrigerant circulating circuit thereof.There has been commonly known an air conditioner as
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Open Gazette No.4-251158.
The air conditioner has a refrigerant circulating
circuit in which a compressor, a four-way selector valve, an
outdoor heat exchanger, a rectification circuit, an indoor
heat exchanger and an accumulator are connected in this order
and which is reversibly operatable between a cooling operation
cycle and a heating operation cycle. The rectification circuit
has four delivery valves, a motor-operated expansion valve and
a receiver located on an upstream side of the expansion valve.In the refrigerant circulating circuit, during the cooling
operation cycle, the outdoor heat exchanger condenses
refrigerant transmitted from the compressor, the motor-operated
expansion valve reduces the pressure of the refrigerant and
then the indoor heat exchanger evaporates the refrigerant. On
the other hand, during the heating operation cycle, the four-way
selector valve is switched over, the indoor heat exchanger 
condenses refrigerant transmitted from the compressor, the
motor-operated expansion valve reduces the pressure of the
refrigerant and then the outdoor heat exchanger evaporates the
refrigerant.In the above-mentioned air conditioner, the receiver is
provided on a high-pressure line into which high-pressure refrigerant
flows all the time and the accumulator is provided
on the intake side of the compressor so that surplus refrigerant
in the heating operation cycle is stored in the receiver.
At a transient time to a steady state in the cooling and
heating operation cycles, liquefied refrigerant flowing toward
the compressor is removed by the accumulator, thus preventing
the liquefied refrigerant from returning to the compressor.In the air conditioner, however, the accumulator is
provided in the refrigerant circulating circuit, which invites
increase in devices. Further, pressure loss in the accumulator
deteriorates running performance of the air conditioner.When the accumulator is merely removed from the refrigerant
circulating circuit, the receiver has only one function of
storing refrigerant and cannot regulate a circulating amount
of refrigerant. This reduces an allowance range of a charge
amount of refrigerant.Furthermore, since the rectification circuit is provided
in order that the
