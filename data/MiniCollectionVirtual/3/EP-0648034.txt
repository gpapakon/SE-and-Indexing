<ABSTRACT>
A communication network (VCN) offering an ETHERNET 
service to a plurality of local terminals (ELT1, ELTN, TLT1, 

TLTN1-8), typically computers, is proposed. Flexibility and 
cost are enhanced with respect to existing ETHERNET networks 

by emulating an ETHERNET network towards the local terminals 
whilst pooling complex functions in a computer network server 

(LANS) connected to the backbone ATM netork (BB). 
This is achieved by coupling the local terminals, 
preferably separately, to standard ETHERNET links (ELN, TL1, 

TLN1-8) and by terminating these links in interface modules 
(EIM1, EIMN, TIM1, TIMN) converting the ETHERNET frames from 

the local terminals in ATM packets destined for the central 
server which stores these packets in an input buffer (IB1-X) 

and performs the above complex functions, particularly also 
the transmission of these packets to appropriate ones of the 

interface modules. Buffer overflow is avoided by transmitting 
backpressure signals (BP1-X) to the interface modules so as 

to control them to halt transmission on the computer links. 
The present invention is particularly well suited 
for early deployment of ATM networks as their inherent high 

bitrate transmission capability is used to provide ETHERNET 
type services at a lower cost per terminal whilst employing 

standard access technology.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication 
network including a plurality of computer network links each 
coupled to at least one local terminal accessing said link 
according to a standard media access protocol. Communication networks such as the subject one are 
well known in the computer communications field, the most 
widespread examples being the local and metropolitan area 
networks, LAN and MAN respectively, realized according to a 
variety of IEEE standards commonly known as the 802 series. 
The latter networks use a shared transmission medium for the 
transmission of data between the local terminals. The use of 
this shared transmission medium has to be arbitrated and the 
procedure used therefor, generally known as media access 
protocol MAC, forms the main part of the above standards and 
determines to a large extent the computer network link type 
to be used. Although these known networks, developed separately 
from the public telecommunications network, are presently the 
best known solution for the specific problems associated with 
computer communications, it is widely appreciated that they 
are intrinsically expensive with regard to installation and 
maintenance costs. The above is all the more true if only a 
small number of local terminals use the network as then the 
network cost per terminal considerably increases due to the 
relatively large fixed costs associated with wiring, control 
and communication with remote terminals, i.e. terminals from 
outside the network, which has to be performed via a separate 
module known as bridge/router module. Large maintenance costs 
occur when a plurality of parallel networks called collision 
domains, each having their own fixed costs, are necessary in 
a same site due to limitations on the number of local 
terminals connected to a same network. Indeed, a change in 
network traffic conditions then often requires physically  
 
changing the wiring of these networks in order to obtain more 
suitable collision domains. It can thus be seen that the above known computer 
networks whilst providing a good and, thanks to large sales 
figures, cheap access method for terminals tend to be rather 
expensive over-all due to their rather expensive wiring and 
network termination equipment, especially when communication 
between the local and remote terminals is needed, and due to 
their lack of flexibility once implemented. These drawbacks 
are most outspoken when a number of small and distributed 
clusters of terminals need to be interconnected and
