<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor memory device, storage electrodes of 
two memory cells adjacent to each other are superimposed 

with each other, with their contours being substantially 
aligned. As a result, the storage electrodes are extended 

to cover two memory cell regions. The superimposed storage 
electrodes are electrically insulated from each other, and 

the upper storage electrode extends through the lower 
storage electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the structure of 
memory cells of a semiconductor memory device, and in 
particular a dynamic-random access memory (DRAM), and a 
method of making it. An example of a configuration of and a method of making 
a DRAM in the prior art is shown in a literature, Inoue, et 
al, "A Spread Stacked Capacitor (SSC) Cell for 64 Mbit 
DRAMs", International Electron Device Meeting (IEDM), pp. 
31-34, December 3-6, 1989. According to this prior art 
technology, parts of the storage electrodes adjacent to each 
other are superimposed with each other to enlarge the 
capacitor area. As a result, it is possible to obtain DRAMs 
having a memory cell capacitance larger than an ordinary 
stacked capacitor cell. To facilitate understanding of the present invention, 
the configuration of the DRAM, and a method of making it, 
shown in the above-mentioned literature will next be 
described with reference to FIG. 8A to FIG. 8F. FIG. 8A to 
FIG. 8E are diagrams showing the steps of fabrication of a 
DRAM in the prior art. FIG. 8F is a plan view of FIG. 8E. First, a device isolating oxide film 12 is formed on a 
silicon substrate 10. Next, a gate oxide film 14 is formed  
 
on the silicon substrate 10 between the device isolation 
oxide films 12. Next, word lines 16 and data lines (not 
shown) are formed. Next, a first oxide film 18, a nitride 
film 20 and a second oxide film 22 are formed in turn over 
the entire surface of the silicon substrate 10, with the 
gate oxide film 14 and the like having been formed. Next, a 
first contact hole 24 extending through the first oxide film 
18, the nitride film 20 and the second oxide film 22 is 
formed. Next, a first storage electrode 26 is formed by 
photolithography and etching on the second oxide film 22, 
filling the first contact hole 24 (FIG. 8A). Next, a third oxide film 28 is formed over the entire 
surface of the laminate body including the first storage 
electrode 26 having been formed. Next, a second contact 
hole 30 extending through the first to third oxide films 18, 
22 and 28, and the nitride film 20 is formed (FIG. 8B). 
The second contact hole 30 is used as a contact hole for a 
storage electrode adjacent to the first storage electrode 
26. Then, a second storage electrode 32 is formed on the 
third oxide film 28, filling the second contact hole 30, by 
means of photolithography and etching (FIG. 8C). Then, the second and third oxide films 22 and 28 above 
the nitride film 20 are removed (FIG. 8D). Next, a capacitor dielectric film 34 is
