<ABSTRACT>
A card file graphical user interface includes at least one central 
processing unit (CPU) coupled through appropriate input/output (I/O) 

circuitry to input devices, such as a cursor control device, and a display 
device. The CPU is further coupled to a storage device for the storage of data 

and programs including a database for display through the card file graphical 
user interface. The database comprises a plurality of source logs wherein each 

source log comprises at least one point. A card file window is provided for 
display on the display device and provides user selectable functions and bars 

for control and manipulation of the display of the database. For each source 
log, there is a corresponding index card, and the index cards are displayed 

within the card file window. The index cards display graphical information 
in a graphical display window displaying either a single point or a sequence of 

points for the corresponding source log. The index cards also display textual 
information for the graphical information displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and methods for 
displaying graphic information, and more particularly, the present invention 
relates to a computer controlled display system for displaying a card file 
graphical user interface including video data. Over the past decade, a variety of graphic user interfaces have 
been developed to ease human interaction with computer systems. Many 
display systems utilize metaphors in the design of the interface as a way of 
maximizing human familiarity, and conveying information between the 
user and the computer. It is common for computer systems incorporating so-called 
"object oriented" display systems to utilize multiple "windows" on a 
display in which combinations of text and graphics are disposed. The display 
systems utilize familiar metaphors, such as desktops, control panels, 
notebooks and the like, such that the interface takes advantage of existing 
human mental structures to permit a user to draw upon the metaphor 
analogy to understand the requirements of the particular computer system. It is well known that designing around a familiar metaphor 
helps reduce human learing time. (See for example, Patrick Chan, 
"Learning Considerations in User Interface Design: The Room Model", 
Report CS-84-16, University of Waterloo Computer Science Department,  Ontario, Canada, July, 1984, and the references cited therein.) The ability to 
operate on images or objects which relate the user to actual objects on, for 
example, a desktop, results in a stronger man-machine interface. (See for 
example, D. Robson, "Object Oriented Software Systems", BYTE, August 1991, 
page 74, Vol. 6, No. 8; L. Tesler, "The Smalltalk Environment", BYTE, August 
1981, page 90, Vol. 6, No. 8; and Smith, et al., "Star User Interface: An 
Overview", National Computer Conference, 1982. Research in interface design using metaphors in man-machine 
interfaces may be applied to computer controlled editing systems to 
incorporate and integrate various production media resources, such as special 
effects, music, graphics and the like. In the case of an editing system, a variety 
of resources must be integrated, scheduled and coordinated with one another 
to obtain a complete multi-media product. Users of computer controlled 
editing systems are generally familiar with the individual resources and the 
coordination of those resources to develop a finished product. Accordingly, 
the "windows" utilized in a video editing system may be designed such that 
the metaphor of the interface takes
