<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a modernisation tool during a changeover 
installation to maintain optimum service to a building by 

providing evenly distributed hall call routing to old and new 
controllers (5,7; 13,16). 
The re-eqipment of the elevators (A,B,C,D,E,F) takes place step 
by step individually or in groups with minimum intrusion into 

the old system and with full maintenance of the safety 
functions that are present. During the time an elevator (D) to 

be re-equipped is shut down the original not yet re-equipped 
elevators (N1) as well as the already re-equipped elevators 

(N2) respond as a single bank, one car per call. 
To this end, an Interim Traffic Manager (ITM) is placed between 
the pushbutton fixtures (8) and the old and new controllers 

(5,7;13,16). When a floor pushbutton (31) is pressed, the 
microprocessor-based Interim Traffic Manager (ITM) uses an 

routing algorithm (RA) to decide, whether to send the call to 
the old or to the new system, in dependence on traffic loading. 
The Interim Traffic Manager (ITM) is an inexpensive, re-usable 
unit, which resides on the job site temporarily, and therefore 

adds no additional costs to the modernisation of an elevator 
group. Technical knowledge required for its installation is 

restricted to fixture wiring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new and improved method and 
new and improved equipment for modernising the control of an 
elevator group, having several elevators for servicing a 
plurality of floor landings in a building, including 
call-registering equipment, which are arranged on the floors 
and by which hall calls can be entered for desired floors, and 
further including group controller means, with signal 
processing means responsive to said hall calls and to signals 
indicative of conditions of each of said cars for providing for 
each car with respect to each hall call registered a signal to 
dispatch a car to answer said hall call, wherein the 
modernising operation is carried out in steps in that at least 
one elevator is temporarily taken out of operation whilst the 
remaining operationally capable elevators are operated together 
as a group. During the elevator modernization, where old elevator controls 
are replaced with new controls, a method of providing optimum 
service to the building is required. Unless other provisions 
are made, hall calls are restricted to either original or 
already updated elevators, which reduces the conveying capacity 
of the elevator group and thereby leads to prolonged waiting 
times. Various methods have become known of handling this 
problem: In a first method new and old pushbutton fixtures are 
present at each floor during change-over periods. This however 
allows the passenger to select his preference and therefore may 
cause traffic loading imbalance. Also, some passengers might 
select both pushbutton demands, requiring cars from each system 
to answer a single hall call. Furthermore, two pushbutton 
fixtures on each floor may lead to passenger confusion. In a 
second method, preferably applicable to older systems, during 
change-over periods, the original and the already updated 
elevators were adjusted to separate floors, so two  
 
elevators would not be assigned to answer identical hall calls 
One basic drawback to this method must be seen, in that when 
one system has a malfunction, floors assigned to that system 
are not served. Moreover, the pushbutton fixture wiring has to 
be relocated depending on which system each floor has been 
designated. In addition, heavy demand floors like lobby or 
restaurant floors are serviced poorly.
 
In another method, during change-over periods, original and 
already updated elevators were interconnected to allow all 
elevators to see the same call. Unless the voltage supplies for 
the original and the already

for providing for each car with respect to each hall call 
registered a signal to dispatch a car to answer said 

hall call, 
wherein the modernising operation is carried out in steps 

in that at least one elevator is temporarily taken out of 
operation whilst the remaining operationally capable 

elevators are operated together as a group, characterised 
by the following method steps: 


a) Integration of an Interim Traffic Manager (ITM) into 
the elevator group N(A,B,C,D,E,F) to be modernised, 

wherein the old pushbutton rising lead (9) is 
disconnected from the old group control (7) and a new 

pushbutton rising lead (10) is installed and connected 
to the input (I1) of the Interim Traffic Manager (ITM), 

the first output (O1) of which is connected to the old 
group control (7); 
b) Installation of a new group control (13) into the 
elevator group N(A,B,C,D,E,F) to be modernised, wherein 

the call inputs of the new group control (13) are

control of the new group control (13); 
k) repetition of the steps (d) and (e); and 
l) disassembly of the Interim Traffic Manager (ITM) as 
well as of the old group control (7) from the adapted 

elevator group N(A,B,C,D,E,F) and connection of 
the old rising lead (9) with the input (14) of the new 

group control (13). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby,

subordination of the individual elevators (A,B,C,D,E,F) 
takes place group by group and that the individual 

elevators are for this purpose combined into groups of 
different sizes.

interface to the existing pushbutton fixtures (8), the 

second input-output modules (19) as interface to the new 
group control (13) and the third input-output modules 

(20) as interface to the old relay control (21), 
that the input-output modules (18,19,20) are isolated 
from each other to accomodate current-sourcing and 

current-sinking call registration systems and to allow 
the use of AC o
r DC call-registering acknowledgement 
lamps (29) and 
that the Interim Traffic Manager (ITM) stands in 
connection with the old group control (7) and with the
