<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for 
supplying and modifying the data required 

in the control system of an elevator and 
for displaying the instructions needed 

for installation, maintenance and 
adjustment on a display (13) comprised in 

the control system. According to the 
invention, the parameter data of the 

elevator control system and the 
instructions for each person carrying out 

maintenance work are stored in a separate 
storage unit (17). When modification or 

maintenance work is being carried out, a 
communication link is established between 

the storage unit (17) and the data 
storage means of a control unit (1) 

comprised in the control system, the data 
stored in the storage unit (17) is read 

and saved in the control unit (1) and the 
modifications and actions required by the 

data read from the storage unit (17) are 
carried out in the control unit (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for supplying
and modifying the data required in the control system of an
elevator and for producing the instructions needed for
installation, maintenance and adjustment on a display
comprised in the control system.The closest prior art is seen in EP-A-366097 which discloses
such a procedure.Modern elevator control systems make it possible to realize
numerous different applications designed to take into
account the requirements imposed by the users and purchasers
of an apparatus or by its operating process and environment.
For example, door control systems, the operation of signalling
devices or the rights of operation can be altered by
suitably modifying the elevator control data.In previously known technology, the changes referred to have
been made by changing the circuit card in the control unit
which determines the function in question. For this reason,
it has been necessary to design special circuits for each
application. Similarly, the updating of programs and parameters
has required the replacement of memory circuits.
Especially during installation and testing, changes have to
be made several times.When carrying out installation, maintenance and repair
operations, installers need instructions stored in the
memory of the control unit. The extent and degree of detail
of the instructions are determined on the basis of the
installers' requirements, experience and knowledge. The
control unit must be equipped with corresponding memory
circuits for each elevator.When servicing an elevator, the installation personnel often
need to make modifications in the programming because of the
user's requirements and equivalent reasons. This is
generally done via an operator interface fitted in
conjunction with the control unit of the elevator. The 
operator is guided in his actions by instructions given via
a display unit fitted in the operator interface. The
operation of the operator interface as well as the manner of
presentation and extent of the information presented through
the display can be modified to suit each operator.When the elevator belongs to an elevator group certain
parameters are common to all elevators of the group. Every
elevator in the group has the same group parameters, which
must be installed manually to every elevator.When the control system of an elevator is being installed,
the elevator-specific configuration and parameter data are
transferred to the elevator control system. Most of this
data effects to many different parts of the elevator

<CLAIMS>
Procedure for supplying and modifying data required in a
control system of an elevator, of an elevator group and for

producing instructions needed for installation, maintenance and
adjustment on a display (13) comprised in the control system,

characterized in that parameter data of the control system and preselected
instruction data for each operator carrying out work in separate

individualized storage unit is stored when modification, repair
or maintenance work is being carried out on the elevator


establishing a communication link between said separate
storage unit and a data storage of a control unit in a

control system;
supplying said data stored in said separate individualized
storage unit to said control unit;
saving the supplied data in the control unit;
producing instructions to the operator in accordance with
the parameter data and preselected instruction data supplied

from the separate individualized storage unit and
safed in the control unit; and
carrying out at least one of installation, maintenance,
repair and modification in accordance with said instructions,

whereby failure and feedback information is stored in
the storage unit (17) in connection with operation and testing.
Procedure according to claim 1, in which parameter and
program data for an elevator are stored in a storage unit,


characterized
 in that the data contained in the storage unit
(17) are read into the control system in connection with

installation.
Procedure according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that in
connection with modification work, modified program and/or

parameter data stored in the storage unit (17) are read into
the control system.
Procedure according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
information required by maintenance and repair work is

loaded into the control system and shown on a text display
(13) comprised in the control unit (1).
Procedure according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the
information is presented in a language selected by means of

a storage unit. 
Procedure according to claim 5, 
characterized
