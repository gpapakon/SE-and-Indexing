<ABSTRACT>
The metal case (1) comprise a base member (10) and an enclosure 
member (2) integrally formed of an alloy including copper, tungsten and 

nickel. The case is manufactured by a 
powder metallurgy injection molding process using infiltration to 

manufacture net-shape products comprising steps of mixing tungsten 
powder and nickel powder having average particle sizes equal to or less 

than 40 Âµm so as to form mixed metal powder, kneading the mixed metal 
powder with an organic binder so as to form a admixture, injection 

molding said admixture so as to form a predetermined green shape, 
debinderizing said green shape and infiltrating copper into the green 

shape so as to produce a net-shape product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal casing for a semiconductor
device and method for manufacturing it, and more specifically to a metal
casing suitable for a semiconductor device such as a photodiode, a laser
diode, a microwave device for microwave communication, and a high
power supply which has high thermal conductivity , high heat spreading
and thermal expansion coefficient similar to those of a semiconductor, a
ceramic or glass element disposed on the metal casing, and method for
manufacturing the metal casing at low cost.A metal casing for a high power supply and a semiconductor device
used for optical communication or microwave communication generally
comprises a base member on which the semiconductor device is mounted
and an enclosure member which is fixed on the base member and which
surrounds the semiconductor device and on which terminal pins for
wiring are fixed by some particular ways. For example, terminal pins are 
mounted on ceramic mounting members and the ceramic mounting
members are fixed to the enclosure member of the metal casing. In
another case, terminal pins are fixed to holes of the enclosure member by
using sealing glass.In case of a metal casing for a semiconductor device for optical
communication, the enclosure member comprises an opening for
transmitting or receiving optical signals. Glass is usually fitted to the
opening. An optical fiber is arranged near the outside of the opening.In addition, a metal frame may be disposed on an upper edge of the
enclosure member in order to fix a sealing cap.The metal casing is heated while the semiconductor device mounted
in it functions. As mentioned above, since the ceramic members and the
glass part are fixed on the enclosure member, the enclosure member is
preferably formed of a material having a thermal expansion coefficient
similar to those of the ceramic members and the glass part. In addition,
the enclosure member generally has a complicated shape, its material is
required to have good machinability. Furthermore, the enclosure
member should have certain rigidity.In order to fulfill the above requirements, an enclosure member of
a conventional metal casing is often formed of an iron-nickel alloy or an
iron-nickel-cobalt alloy. On the contrary, a base member of the
conventional metal casing is formed of a metal or an alloy having a good
thermal conductivity and heat spreading such as copper or a
copper-tungsten alloy in order to radiate heat generated by a
semiconductor device mounted on it.In the conventional metal casing, the
