<ABSTRACT>
In order to establish connections of plural arithmetic 
units capable of performing basic functions such as filtering 

in various connection ways, a bus switch is provided which has 
a plurality of input data lines connected with output terminals 

of the arithmetic units, at least one external input data line, 
a plurality of output data lines connected with input terminals 

of the arithmetic units, and at least one external output data 
line. In addition, two register sets are provided which hold 

arithmetic control information designating contents of 
processes to be performed by the arithmetic units and 

connection control information designating connection ways 
within the bus switch. Depending on the broadcasting system, 

information held by one of the register sets and information 
held by the other are updated, and, according to a process 

algorithm, either one of the two register sets is selected. As 
a result of such arrangement, a single piece of image 

processing hardware can be shared between different 
broadcasting systems as well as between different algorithms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a signal processor for the
television receiver and the like apparatus.Recently, there has been high demand for television
systems having the capability of providing improved picture
quality. To meet this demand, various television systems have
been proposed, of which a television system called EDTV
(Extended Definition Television) has been put to practical use.
MUSE (Multiple sub-Nyquist Sampling Encoding), which is one of
the sampling and encoding systems for the HDTV (High Definition
Television) system, has been proposed and partly put to
practical use. It is expected that advanced television
systems, including EDTV II (i.e.. the second-generation EDTV)
and digital TV, will come in practice in the near future. This
requires video signal processors such as TV receivers and video
tape recorders (VTR) to function to receive and reproduce
signals transmitted by different television systems including
the NTSC (National Television System Committee) system.
Additionally, special hardware that can deal with a plurality
of digital filter arithmetic operations is also required.Referring to FIG. 25, a conventional TV receiver is
illustrated. TV receiver 401 receives both MUSE-system TV
signals and EDTV-system TV signals. 403 is a piece of hardware
that is dedicated to implement an algorithm for the MUSE-system
processing, and 404 is a piece of hardware that is dedicated to 
implement an algorithm for the EDTV-system processing.
Selector 405 performs a selection between an image signal that
is decoded by MUSE hardware 403 and an image signal that is
decoded by EDTV hardware 404 for displaying the selected signal
on display unit 402. As described above, this conventional TV
receiver 401 contains plural pieces of dedicated hardware to be
compatible with different TV systems, and hardware switching
from one TV system to another must be made depending on the
received TV signal. This results in increasing the cost of TV
receivers. Further, to be compatible with TV signals by
forthcoming television systems and to deal with process
algorithm modifications, new hardware must be developed which
is time-consuming and expensive. Other signal processors for
image processing, image identification, image compression, and
audio processing which are required to perform a process switch
also suffer the same problem described above.C. Joanblanq et al discuss a programmable digital signal
processor in a paper entitled "A 54-MHz CMOS Programmable Video
Signal Processor for HDTV Applications," IEEE Journal
