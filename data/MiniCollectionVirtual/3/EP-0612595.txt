A process for upgrading low-quality wood to high-quality wood 
comprising the following stages: 


a) softening the wood by directly heating it electrically in the 
presence of a softening agent at a pressure of at least the 

equilibrium vapour pressure of the softening agent at the 
operating temperature; 
b) drying the softened wood;

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for upgrading low-quality 
wood to high-quality wood in an environmentally sound way, and to 
high-quality wood obtained by means of this process. Such a process 
is known from EP-A-0373726. According to this document a cellulosic fibrous aggregate is 
formed from a cellulosic fibrous material by a process which 
comprises: a softening stage comprising exposing a section of 
cellulosic fibrous material to the action of an aqueous softening 
agent at a temperature in the range of from 150 °C to 220 °C at a 
pressure of at least the equilibrium vapour pressure of the 
softening agent at the operating temperature, thereby at least 
partially disproportionating and hydrolysing the hemicellulose and 
lignin present in the cellulosic fibrous material; and a curing 
stage comprising drying the product of the softening stage at a 
temperature in the range of from 100 °C to 220 °C to yield a 
cross-linked cellulosic matrix. The hereinbefore mentioned process uses traditional ways of 
heating and drying the wood. These methods rely on thermal 
conduction to raise the temperature of the wood and evaporate water 
contained therein. The poor thermal conductivity of wood and the 
sensitivity of the process chemistry to extended heating times 
result in limitations on product thickness and quality for such a 
process. Furthermore, it has been found that gradients in 
temperature, pressure and moisture concentration induce stresses in 
wood, which may result in the formation of cracks and consequently 
in a loss of mechanical strength. Finally, long heating times lead 
to low throughput and thus to an unattractive process economy. It has now been found that the above mentioned problems can be 
avoided by employing alternative processing techniques based on 
electric or dielectric heating.  
 Therefore, the present invention relates to a process for 
upgrading low-quality wood to high-quality wood comprising the 
following stages: 
a) softening the wood by directly heating it electrically to a 
temperature in the range of from 160-220 °C, in the presence 
of an aqueous medium at a pressure of at least the equilibrium 
vapour pressure of the aqueous medium at the operating 
temperature during the softening stage;  b) drying the softened wood;  c) curing the dried wood; d) cooling the cured wood. The starting material to be subjected to the process according 
to the present invention is wood of a relatively low-quality, 
preferably freshly harvested material, the loss of moisture from 
wh
