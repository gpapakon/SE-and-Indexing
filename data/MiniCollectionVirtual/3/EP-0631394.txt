<ABSTRACT>
A multi-gradation thin-film liquid crystal display (TFT/LCD) 
includes a data line driver which does not cause an increase in the chip 

area, (i.e., which is constituted of a smaller number of circuit 
elements). Power supplies having respective reference potentials V
a
 and 
V
b
 corresponding to at least two different gradations, and switches SW
a
 
and SW
b
 for selectively supplying the respective potentials to a data 
line, are provided in a driver IC for driving the data lines of a TFT/LCD 

panel. If an output potential corresponding to an arbitrary gradation 
between the two predetermined gradations is denoted by V
c
, the output 
potential V
c
 is supplied to the data line by being turned on and off the 
switches SW
a
 and SW
b
 alternately at a predetermined cycle in a ratio in 
which the potential V
c
 proportionally divides the potentials V
a
 and V
b
. 
Therefore, the output potential corresponding to an arbitrary gradation 

between the two predetermined gradations can be obtained simply by 
properly changing the ratio of turning the two switches on and off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display apparatus 
including a driver for driving data lines of the liquid crystal display 
panel. Drivers for multi-gradation thin-film transistor liquid crystal 
displays (TFT/LCD) are generally classified into analog type and digital 
type. In the analog type driver, an analog data signal representing 
gradations of respective pixels is sampled and held using switches and 
capacitors, buffered in operational amplifiers (voltage followers) and 
then output to data lines of a display panel. In theory, the analog type driver can produce continuous (i.e., 
infinite) gradations. In practice, however, there are various problems 
such as low accuracy of output voltages, low operation speed and large 
power consumption, and thus the analog type driver is rarely used for 
computer displays. On the other hand, in the digital type driver, a plurality of power 
supplies having different potentials are connected to each data line 
through their respective switches and a voltage signal is supplied to 
each data line by selectively turning on one of the switches in 
accordance with the input data. Since no linear circuit is used, the 
digital type driver consumes little power. Furthermore, since the power 
supply voltages are output as they are, output voltages are highly 
accurate and the operation speed can easily be increased. However, to 
increase display gradations, it is necessary to increase the number of 
power supply terminals to provide potentials corresponding to the 
respective necessary gradations and the number of switches corresponding 
to the respective power supply terminals. Japanese patent application PEPA No. 61-58008 published on December 
9, 1986 discloses a voltage generation circuit for producing a plurality 
of differing voltage outputs from a pair of power supplies in the above 
type of driver. In this circuit, a plurality of intermediate voltages 
between the voltages of the pair of power supplies are generated by 
dividing the interval between the two power supply voltages using a 
plurality of resistors based on the operation of selection switches. By 
connecting capacitors at positions where the voltage difference across  
 
the terminals of the division resistor is constant, the problem of the 
output waveform distortion is solved without increasing the power 
consumption. However, in the above conventional circuit, a number of resistors 
and switches need to be provided on a chip. Therefore, to increase the 
number of display
