<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for sealing a thermoplastic-coated 
packaging laminate (11), with at least one layer of a metal foil. The 

apparatus includes an inductor (1) connected to a high frequency current 
source. The inductor (1) has three parallel conductors (2, 3) which, together 

with a magnetic core (5), are disposed in an electrically insulating carrier 
portion (4). The conductors (2, 3) are disposed such that the current density 

in the surface (7) of the conductors (2, 3) is equal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for sealing a 
thermoplastic-coated material, with at least one layer of a metal foil, 
preferably aluminium, the apparatus comprising an inductor which is 
connectible to a high frequency current source and displays substantially 
parallel, slightly spaced apart conductors, a core of magnetic material and 
an electrically insulating carrier portion. It has long been known in the packaging industry to employ 
packaging materials comprising outer layers of thermoplastic, these outer 
layers being capable of being sealed together by fusion after heating and 
compression for realizing tight and durable sealing joints or seams. For 
example, such a material may be fed in web form through a filling machine 
and formed into a tube which is longitudinally sealed by means of a lap 
joint. This material tube is filled with its contemplated contents, whereafter 
the tube is transversely sealed and severed to form individual packages 
which, in a later stage, are finally formed, for example into parallelepipedic 
packages or cartons. A packaging material including a metal foil, preferably aluminium foil, 
is ideally employed when the transverse seals are made by so-called 
induction sealing. An apparatus for such induction sealing is disclosed and 
described in Swedish Patent Specification SE 451 973. In this instance, an 
induction current is induced in the aluminium layer of the packaging 
material, this current heating the thermoplastic layer disposed adjacent the 
aluminium layer so that the thermoplastic layer can be sealed to a 
corresponding thermoplastic layer. The above-described method of transversely sealing packaging 
blanks as described in the above-disclosed patent specification has, 
however, proved to be unsuitable for highly viscous products and products 
containing particles such as kernels, fruit seeds or fibres. According to the 
above-described method, two substantially parallel transverse seals are 
made between which the packaging tube is severed to form individual  
 
packaging blanks. In this instance, sealing flaps or fins are created which lie 
outside the transverse seals and where product residues may accumulate. 
These product residues can, on storage of the package, take on a highly 
disagreeable and unhealthy appearance. One object of the present invention is to realize an apparatus for 
induction sealing which is suitable for use together with products which are 
highly viscous or which contain particles such as kernels, fruit seeds or
