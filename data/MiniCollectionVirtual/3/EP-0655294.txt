<ABSTRACT>
In the butt-seal laser welding of plates, in particular of plates of unequal thickness, the temperature is measured behind the solidification front at two points. From the combination of the two measured values, a number of characteristic process values can be determined by means of which the welding process can be controlled.

Process of process control and/or quality control during butt-joint 
laser-welding of sheet metal, in particular thin metal sheets, 

measuring simultaneously and on both sides of the seam line 
the temperature at a minimum of two points behind the welding 

zone. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
temperature measuring values are combined. 
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
temperature measuring values are added. 
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
temperature measuring values are subtracted from each other. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in 
that
 metal sheets of different gauges are welded together. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in 
that
 both temperature measurings are carried out closely behind 
the solidification front. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in 
that
 the temperature measurings are carried out symmetrically 
to the seam line. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in 
that
 the temperature measurings are carried out asymmetrically 
to the seam line. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in 
that
 both temperature measurings are carried out at the same 
distance from the welding point, or both temperature 

measurings are carried out at an unequal distance from the 
welding point. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
measuring area has a respective diameter of approximately 

between 0.5 and 5 mm, preferably 1 mm diameter, or the 
measuring area has a surface of approximately 1 mm
2
.  
 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in 
that
 the temperature measuring values are combined or 
compared with measuring values of the laser output. 
Laser-welding apparatus for carrying out the process according 
to one of Claims 1 to 11, comprising at least two pyrometers 

which are arranged on both sides of the seam line of welded 
metal sheets for the purpose of temperature measuring behind 

the welding zone, and a signal evaluation device for evaluation 
of temperature measuring values and their association to 

characteristic process data.
