<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine fuel injector 
having a selectively openable nozzle (10) through which 

fuel is delivered to a combustion chamber of the engine. 
The nozzle (10) comprises a port having an internal 

annular surface (43) and a valve member (20) having an 
external annular surface (44) co-axial with respect to 

the internal annular surface. The annular surfaces are 
shaped so that when the internal and external annular 

surfaces are in sealing contact at a seat line adjacent 
the downstream end of the surfaces, thereby closing the 

nozzle, the maximum width (47) of the passage between 
the said surfaces is not substantially more than 30 

microns, preferably not more than 20 microns, in the 
direction normal to said surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve controlled nozzle for the injection
of fuel in an internal combustion engine. In this specification, the term "internal
combustion engine" is to be understood to be limited to engines having an
intermittent combustion cycle, such as reciprocating or rotary engines, and does
not include continuous combustion engines such as turbines.A fuel injector according to the preamble of claim 1 is known
from DE-A-3 737 896.The characteristics of the spray of fuel delivered from a nozzle to
an internal combustion engine, such as directly into the combustion chamber,
have a major effect on the efficiency of the burning of the fuel, which in turn
affects the stability of the operation of the engine, the engine fuel efficiency and
the composition of the engine exhaust gases. To optimise these effects,
particularly in a spark ignited engine, the desirable characteristics of the spray
pattern of the fuel issuing from the nozzle include small fuel drop size (liquid
fuels), controlled geometry and penetration of the fuel spray, and, at least at low
engine loads, a relatively contained and evenly distributed ignitable cloud of fuel
vapour in the vicinity of the engine spark plug.Some known injection nozzles, used for the delivery of fuel directly-into
the combustion chamber of an engine, are of the poppet valve type, which
delivers the fuel in the form of a cylindrical or divergent conical spray. The
nature of the shape of the fuel spray is dependent on a number of factors
including the geometry of the port and valve constituting the nozzle, especially
the surfaces of the port and valve immediately adjacent the seat where the port
and valve engine to seal when the nozzle is closed. Once a nozzle geometry
has been selected to give the required performance, relatively minor departures
from that geometry can significantly impair that performance.In particular, the attachment or build-up of solid combustion
products or other deposits on the surfaces over which the fuel flows can be
detrimental to the correct performance of the nozzle. The principal cause of
build-up on these surfaces is the adhesion thereto of carbon related or other
particles that may be produced by the combustion or partial combustion or
residual fuel left on these surfaces between injection cycles, or by carbon
related particles produced in the combustion chamber during combustion. The build-up of deposits on these surfaces can also affect the
metering performance of an injector nozzle where the metering of the fuel is
carri

passage, characterized in that the maximum width of the passage between
said annular surfaces is not substantially more than 30

microns.
