<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for purifying streams which 
contain organic and/or inorganic impurities, the stream to be treated 
being introduced into a water-containing reaction zone. International Patent Application PCT/NL90/00075 (publication 
number WO 90/14312) discloses a process for the treatment of water which 
is contaminated with unwanted constituents such as (aromatic) 
hydrocarbons and pesticides, by treating the contaminated water or the 
gaseous and/or liquid components present therein or originating therefrom 
with ozone and a catalyst such as activated carbon, the catalyst being 
regenerated continuously with ozone. This process, however, has the drawback 
that the ozone consumption for the purpose of decomposition of the 
impurities (expressed as COD = chemical oxygen demand), in spite of the 
relatively low values, is still too high for many applications and the 
residence time in the reactor is rather long. Dutch Patent Application 9000118 discloses a method for 
purifying streams which contain organic and/or inorganic impurities, in 
which the stream to be treated is introduced into a water-containing 
reaction zone to which current is supplied via one or more electrodes 
while a substance is supplied at the same time which, under the influence 
of the electric current supplied, produces radicals which react with the 
impurities. The examples given of substances of this type comprise 
methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, ammonia, oxygen, ozone and hydrogen 
peroxide. The substance producing electrochemical radicals in the process 
is preferably fed to the reaction zone via a porous electrode. The residence 
time in the reaction zone can be shortened by employing elevated 
temperatures, preferably in the range from 10 to 95°C. The degree of 
conversion and the electric energy consumption in this known method still 
leaves something to be desired. A process and apparatus for electrochemical reactions to be 
used for pollution control are known from US-A-3,915,822. An electrochemical 
cell is used wherein an electrolyte - which contains impurities or 
undesirable components - is treated in a reaction zone containing electrically 
conductive particles, e.g. carbon pellets, as well as a plurality 
of electrodes. The conductive particles may consist of activated carbon 
in granular, spherical or other form. The voltage is normally a DC 
potential gradient in the order of 0.1 to 10 Volts/cm. During the process  
 
of this US patent a gas reactant such as O3 or Cl2 may be used. It is
