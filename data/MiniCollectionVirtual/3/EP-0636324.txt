<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to filtered smoking articles, such as cigarettes, in
which the yield or delivery of particulate material, both total and per puff, is controlled
and a method of making filtered smoking articles with predetermined total and per puff
yields of particulate matter.It is well known that smoking articles, particularly conventional filtered or
unfiltered cigarettes, provide an increasing per puff yield of particulate matter
("puff-to-puff yield") as the cigarette is smoked. In recent years, high efficiency filters and
air dilution have been used to provide a lower total yield of particulate matter in the
so-called "low tar" and "ultra low tar" cigarettes now available in the marketplace. Such
high efficiency filters significantly increase the pressure drop of the cigarette and decrease
yield, especially in the first few puffs of the cigarette. Air dilution helps to reduce the
pressure drop somewhat, but also further reduces the per puff yield in the first few puffs.
In combination, high filtration efficiency and air dilution configured in the conventional
way in a cigarette not only produces the desired lower total yield, but also produces an
undesirable per puff yield or puff profile of little yield in the first few puffs and a high yield
in the final few puffs. Such a puff profile results in a perception by the smoker of a
cigarette with inconsistent taste characteristics, i.e., little or no taste in the first few puffs
and a harsh and overbearing taste in the final few puffs.The prior art has attempted to address this problem in several ways. In one known
construction of a cigarette smoking article, a compound filter is made up of two filter
segments, a rod end segment and a mouth end segment. The rod end segment is made of
a cellulose acetate fiber tow with a relatively high pressure drop thereacross (high
efficiency) and which has been provided with one or more hollow cellulose acetate fibers
or capillary tubes extending therethrough. The mouth end filter segment abuts the rod end
filter segment and is made of a cellulose acetate fiber tow with a relatively low pressure
drop thereacross (low efficiency). Air ventilation holes are provided in the rod end filter
segment. In a cigarette of the foregoing construction, during the first few puffs, a major
portion of the smoke travels from the lighted end of the cigarette through the tobacco rod,
through the capillary tube(s) in the rod end filter segment and thence through the low
efficiency mouth end filter segment. This results
