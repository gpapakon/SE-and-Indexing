<ABSTRACT>
Immunogen, for prepn. of antibodies (Ab) specific for haemoglobin (Hb) A1c, of formula (I) is new. m = 1-40; T = carrier protein; A = spacer, with 10-20 atoms in the chain, of formula (i) X = S or NH; n = 1-4; B = organic gp. contg. a succinimido residue. Also new is the cell line ECACC 87120801. Pref. A contains 12-18 atoms; m = 3-20 and B = succinimidyl -hexanoyl.
