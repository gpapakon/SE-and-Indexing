<ABSTRACT>
Linear normal olefins are separated from mixtures with non-normal 
olefins by adsorption with a high silica molecular sieve, e.g., silicalites, ZSM-5, 

etc., having low acid catalytic reactivity, which selectively adsorbs the normal 
olefins, and thereafter these normal olefins are recovered in high yield by 

contacting the resulting normal olefin -containing molecular sieve with a 
desorbent which comprises a C₃ to C₈ ketone such as methylethylketone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention pertains is the adsorptive 
separation of normal C₅ to C₈ olefins from mixtures thereof with non-normal C₅ 
to C₈ olefins. The separation of many classes of compounds by selective adsorption is 
well known. Separations of various mixtures containing olefins into their 
components are also known, e.g., the preferential adsorption of linear olefins 
over branched olefins using adsorbents such as ZSM-5 and silicalite. See US-A-4,309,281 
and US-A-4,061,724. EP-A-0 372 938 and EP-A-0 372 939 disclose a method for treating 
silicalite or ZSM-5 zeolites to enable the treated adsorbents to selectively adsorb 
n-olefins and n-paraffins from C₉-C₁₉ hydrocarbon mixtures thereof with 
branched olefins, branched paraffins, aromatic hydrocarbons and 
sulfur-containing compounds without catalyzing reactions of the olefinic feed 
materials. The adsorbent is first treated with an acid and subsequently treated 
with a base to remove residual acidity, e.g., from the adsorbent itself or from the 
binder, such as silica, so as to reduce acid catalytic activity. US-A-4,455,445 discloses the separation of normal C₄ olefins from 
isobutylene with silicalite adsorbent. The adsorbed normal C₄ hydrocarbons are 
desorbed with pentene-1. The patentees also suggest advantages of diluting the 
desorbent with a material which will not be selectively retained by the molecular 
sieve (i.e., not capable of acting as a desorbent), e.g., iso-octane. US-A-4,486,618 discloses the separation of normal C₆ olefins from C₆ 
branched-chain olefins and C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons with crystalline silica  
 
molecular sieves and recovering normal C₆ olefins by desorption with pentene-1 
or butene-1. Iso-octane may be mixed with the desorbent to function as a 
carrier and diluent. It has now been discovered that certain desorbents are superior to the 
n-olefin and n-paraffin desorbents of the prior art in the separation of normal 
olefins from non-normal olefinic products and that these desorbents facilitate the 
recovery of the product streams from the adsorbent, silicalite, used to separate 
these materials. With this combination of adsorbent and desorbent, normal 
olefins are selectively adsorbed relative to branched-chain olefins and cyclic 
olefins in the feed and the adsorbed normal olefins can be desorbed with less 
"tailing" than prior art desorbents, e.g., olefins, paraffins, cycloparaffins. This 
desorbed extract stream is a valuable product which can be used for the 
production of alcohols. The
