<ABSTRACT>
A developing device is provided with a developer 
vessel fo
r storing therein a developer material composed 
of toner particles and carrier granules and a developer 

material supply section for gradually supplying a carrier 
developer including the carrier granules from above the 

developer vessel, wherein a discharge opening for 
discharging therethrough the developer material is formed 

on a side face of the developer vessel. When a tilt 
detection unit provided with the developing device detects 

the tilt of the developing device, an alarm lamp is set ON 
for sending a warning. In the meantime, the discharge 

opening is closed for preventing an excessive overflow of 
the developer material from the developer vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing device
for storing therein a developer material composed of toner
particles and carrier granules. The device supplies the
developer material onto a surface of a photoreceptor in
order to visualize an electrostatic latent image formed on
the surface of the photoreceptor provided in an
electrophotographic printing machine such as a copying
machine.Developer devices for visualizing (developing) an
electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of a
photoreceptor using a developer material composed of 
carrier granules and toner particles are used, for
example, in many dry-type copying machines. In such
developing devices, the quantity of the toner particles is
reduced while being used in the developing process;
whereas, the quantity of carrier granules in the developer
material remains the same. Therefore, the quality of the
carrier granules being stirred with toner particles in the
developer vessel deteriorates because a resin coating
layer on the surface thereof is peeled, or toner particles
adhere onto the surface thereof. As a result, the
charging ability of the developer material gradually
deteriorates, thereby presenting the problem that the
copied image quality deteriorates.A device designed for the trickle system which
prevents the deterioration of the charging ability by
supplying additional carrier granules separately from the
refill for the used toner particles is disclosed (see, for
example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
21591/1990 (Tokukouhei 2-21591)). In such a device, when
adding additional carrier granules, excessive developer
material in the developer vessel overflows and is
discharged through a discharge opening formed on the side
face of the developer vessel to be collected in a
collecting case. By repeating the above refill and
discharge of the developer material, the developer 
material in the developer vessel whose charging ability
has deteriorated can gradually replace. Thus, the
required charging ability of the developer material can be
maintained, and the copied image quality is prevented from
being lowered.However, in the above developing device, the
developer material in the developer vessel overflows and
is discharged through the discharge opening provided on
the side face of the developer vessel. Thus, depending on
the tilt of the developing device, a quantity of the
developer material to be discharged through the discharge
opening changes. For example, when moving the copying
machine, as being tilted, a large
