<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for facilitating the shaking of a wok to toss the food stuff 
which mainly comprises a disposing frame (10), a wok (20) and shake 

facilitating means (30). The disposing frame (10) mainly comprises a main 
body (12), positioning means and connecting means for positioning the main 

body (12) and connecting the wok (20) and the shake facilitating means (30) 
to the disposing frame (10). The shake facilitating means (30) comprises at 

least one elastic element. The elastic elements can be replaced by a 
hydraulic system. With the elasticity or the hydraulic mechanism, the shake 

facilitating means (30) ensure the easy shaking of the wok (20) to toss the

<DESCRIPTION>
The wok is a main cooker used in Chinese food cooking. The 
shaking, swaying and rocking of a wok to toss the food stuff 
when in cooking is a very important skill in Chinese cookery. 
The purpose of the shaking of the wok to toss the food stuff is 
to cook the food stuff in proportional temperature and to 
rapidly mix the seasons, sauce and condiments with the food 
stuff in a well-distributed condition. However, the cooker 
applied in big restaurants, camps or factories is usually big 
and heavy, and that exhausts a cook's strength or make the 
shaking of a wok to be impossible. The present invention has as a main objective to provide an 
apparatus for facilitating the shaking of a wok to toss the 
food stuff which mainly comprises a disposing frame, a wok and 
shake facilitating means. The disposing frame mainly comprises a main body, 
positioning means and connecting means for positioning the main 
body and connecting the wok and the shake facilitating means to 
the disposing frame. The shake facilitating means comprises at 
least one elastic element. The elastic elements can replaced 
with a hydraulic system. With the elasticity or the hrdraulic  
 
mechanism, the shake facilitating means ensure the easy shaking 
of a wok to toss the food stuff. The disposing frame has a handle portion which extends to 
connect to a main body. The main body has four metal plates 
curving downwards to correspond to wok bottom. Opposite from 
the metal plate which the handle portion is connected to, the 
main body has a balancing bar extending to connect to a 
balancing plate and a counterweight. Two supporting posts have 
a first end extending upwards from a work bench to have a 
second end to connect to the bottom centers of the metal plates 
which are adjacent to the metal plates connected with the 
handle portion and balancing bar, respectively. The supporting 
posts have two magnetic means respectively attaching to their 
second ends for attracting to the wok bottom. The balancing bar has a first end connecting to the main 
body and extending to have a second end to connect to the 
counterweight. Between the first end and second end of the 
balancing bar, two struts have a first end extending upwards 
from the work bench over the balancing bar to connect to the 
ends balancing plate. The shake facilitating means is a recoil 
spring which has one end connecting to the center of the 
balancing plate, and the other end connecting to the balancing 
bar. The recoil spring ensures the easy shaking of a wok to 
toss
