<ABSTRACT>
An overflow drainage device for sinks comprises a spillway mouth (9a) 
associated to one of the holes (R2) formed on the upper horizontal 

plane (L1) of 
the sink to fit in the water-tap units (7), and a drain pipe (2) 

connected by 
water-tight fittings, at the top to said spillway mouth (9a) and at the 

bottom 
to the sink drain. Said spillway mouth (9a) consists of a circumferential 

port 
formed between the edge of said hole (R2) in the sink and the outer 

surface of 
a tubular pipe fitting (9) inserted into said hole (R2) and forming a 

through slot for a tap unit (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is an overflow drainage device, 
to be applied in correspondence of the holes in the upper horizontal 
plane of sinks and, more precisely, of the holes into which are normally 
fitted the water-tap units or the drain plug control unit. As known, sinks (hereinafter reference is made only to sinks, it 
being understood that the same considerations apply both to kitchen and 
to bathroom sinks) are constructed at present with one or more holes on 
their upper horizontal plane (to fit in the water-taps, the water spout 
and/or the plug control unit), with a main water drain hole on the bottom 
of the sink basin, and with an overflow hole on the vertical wall of the 
sink basin, formed at a certain height below its edge. This known arrangement has two kinds of drawbacks: on one hand, it 
compels sink producers to form a supplementary overflow hole, perpendicular 
to the holes for fitting in the taps and/or to the main water drain 
hole, which involves further manufacturing difficulties and costs; on the 
other hand, it does not allow to fill the sink basin up to the top, as 
would often be desirable. To overcome these drawbacks, it has already been proposed - for 
example in AU-B-530101 and in DE-U-9202901 - to make an overflow hole in 
correspondence of an upper horizontal plane of the sink. In both cases, 
the sinks are provided with a hole specially meant for overflow drainage. The object of the present invention is to propose an overflow drainage 
system - of the type of that described in DE-U-9202901 - which makes 
it instead possible to use, for overflow drainage, the usual holes formed 
on the upper horizontal plane of the sink, into which are fitted the 
water-taps or the control unit for the plug of the main water drain hole. In actual fact, an arrangement in which the overflow hole is formed 
into an upper horizontal plane of the sink and is also used to fit in the 
control unit for the drain plug, is already described in DE-A-1915065.  
 
This arrangement has however two kinds of drawbacks: 
on one hand, the overflow hole must have a special toroidal shape, 
which is difficult to manufacture and anyhow involves extra costs; on the other hand, the water flowing through said overflow hole wets 
the whole plug control unit and, in the long run, this produces rust and 
jamming, or anyhow causes damages. The object of the present invention is therefore, more exactly, to 
realize an overflow drainage device of the aforecited type, allowing however 
to overcome all the

<CLAIMS>
Overflow drainage device, particularly for use on sinks, of the 
type comprising a spillway mouth associated to a hole formed in correspondence 

of an upper horizontal plane of the sink, and an auxiliary drain 
pipe connected, by water-tight fittings, at the top to said mouth and at 

the bottom to the sink drain, characterized in that said spillway mouth 
consists of a circumferential port formed between the edge of said hole 

in the upper horizontal plane of the sink and the outer surface of a tubular 
pipe fitting inserted into said hole and forming a through slot for 

a tap unit, a water-spout unit, and/or a drain plug control unit, and in 
that a bush is radiused under said circumferential port by a water-tight 

fitting, said bush surrounding said tubular pipe fitting and forming the 
upper end portion of said auxiliary drain pipe. 
Overflow drainage device as in claim 1), wherein said bush of 
the auxiliary drain pipe comprises sealing gaskets, on one side against 

the outer surface of said tubular pipe fitting and, on the other side, 
against the lower surface of the horizontal wall of the sink into which 

said spillway mouth is formed.
