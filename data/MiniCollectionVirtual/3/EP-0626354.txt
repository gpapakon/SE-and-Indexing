<ABSTRACT>
A method for applying decorative coating to glass which comprises the 
steps of: 


3) applying a pattern of decoration to the glass with a curable 
adhesive ink, 
 
b) curing the adhesive ink, 
 
c) compressing a foil bearing a film of decorative material against 
the glass with a compress heated to at least 395K (250°F), and 
 
d) after removal of the compress peeling off the foil whereby the 
decorative film thereon remains adhered to the adhesive ink pattern 

only. 
Further an adhesive ink is disclosed comprising a monomer, a polymer 
dissolved in said monomer, and a polymerisation-initiating agent, 

preferably a photo-initiator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the application of 
decorative coatings to glass, by a procedure akin to that 
known as hot-stamping. The known hot-stamping procedure involves using a 
heated die or roller to apply both heat and pressure to a 
so-called foil, consisting of a pigmented color or 
metallized surface film borne on an usually-polyester 
carrier, so as to force it into contact with thermoplastic 
substrate, and thereby soften the thermo plastic substrate 
and also activate the film-coating on the foil, thereby 
enabling it to form a strong physico-chemical bond with the 
underlying thermoplastic substrate wherever heat and 
pressure have been applied to the foil, but not elsewhere. 
When subsequently the foil is pulled away, just the areas 
of the film which have been subjected to the hot-stamping 
remain affixed to the plastic substrate, and the remainder 
peels away. In order to carry out this operation one 
normally employs either a vertical stamping or a roll-on 
machine. The vertical stamping machine contains a heated 
die of brass, steel or silicone rubber, which serves to 
apply both heat and pressure and thus to transfer the 
desired pattern (whatever that may be - thus decorative  
 
areas and/or writing or other printed information) of the 
film on to the plastic substrate, as each part is 
positioned beneath the die. Roll-on methods utilize a 
silicone rubber roller or an arcuate die to transfer the 
desired pattern from the foil on the thermoplastic 
substrate in either a continuous or a batch process. Hot-stamping is an efficient and inexpensive way to 
apply decoration to thermoplastic substrates. 
Unfortunately however hot-stamping of this nature cannot be 
used with glass, because glass melts at a much higher 
temperature than most thermoplastic materials. 
Consequently decoration in the form of gold leaf, color 
design or printing etc. is generally applied to glass 
containers by a glazing process similar to that used with 
ceramics. Thus for example in gold-leafing the gold 
decoration is applied to the glass container by a variety 
of methods such as or akin to silk screen printing, etc. 
The glass container is then subjected to extremely high 
kiln temperatures, and in essence the decoration is baked 
on. Unfortunately this process is however time-consuming, 
expensive, energy-intensive and gives rise to safety 
considerations due to the high temperatures that have to be 
employed and the nature of the gases which are involved in 
the operation of the kilns. There is thus a

A method for applying a decorative coating to glass 
which comprises the steps of: 


a) applying an adhesive ink in the form of a 
radiation-curable polymeric composition to the 

glass in a predetermined pattern of decoration; 
b) completely curing the adhesive ink by exposing 
it upon the glass to direct irradiation with the 

radiation by which it is curable, thereby 
bonding the ink to the glass; 
c) compressing a toil bearing a film of decorative 
material against the glass with a compress 

heated to a temperature of at least 395K (250°F) 
and sufficient to adhere the film of decorative 

material to the cured ink pattern; and 
d) on removal of the compress peeling off the 
foil whereby the decorative film thereon remains 

permanently adhered to the cured ink pattern 
only.
