 LUBRICATING OIL HAVING IMPROVED RUST INHIBITION AND DEMULSIBILITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention concerns the use of a synergistic combination of a rust inhibitor containing at least one COOH group and particular derivatives of pyridine.2. Description of Related ArtMany lubricating oils require the presence of rust inhibi¬ tors to inhibit or prevent rust formation, which often occurs due to water contacting a metal surface. However, we have found that the oil/water interfacial tension decreases with increasing concentration of the rust inhibitor. Therefore, although rust inhibition is im¬ proved, the demulsibility of the lubricating oil is degraded. Accord¬ ingly, it would be desirable to have a simple yet convenient means to obtain effective rust inhibition while reducing any adverse effect on the demulsibility of the oil.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn one embodiment, this invention concerns a lubricating oil capable of inhibiting rust formation which comprises a major amount of a lubricating oil basestock and a synergistic additive combination comprising(a) a rust inhibiting amount of a rust inhibitor having at least one COOH acid group, and(b) a pyridine derivative having the formula 

 where Ri, R2, and R3 are independently hydrogen or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms,wherein the weight ratio of (b) to (a) is greater than zero and less than about 0.06:1.In another embodiment, this invention concerns a method for inhibiting rust formation in an internal combustion engine by lubricating the engine with the oil described above.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThis invention requires a major amount of a lubricating oil basestock and a minor amount of a synergistic combination of an oil soluble rust inhibitor containing at least one COOH group and a particular pyridine derivative.The lubricating oil basestock can be derived from natural lubricating oils, synthetic lubricating oils, or mixtures thereof. Suitable lubricating oil basestocks also include basestocks obtained by isomerization of synthetic wax and slack wax, as well as hydro- crackate basestocks produced by hydrocracki-ng (rather than solvent extracting) the aromatic and polar components of the crude. In general, the lubricating oil basestock will have a kinematic viscosity ranging from about 5 to about 10,000 cSt at 40'C, although typical applications will require an oil having a viscosity ranging from about 10 to about 1,000 cSt at 40°C.Natural lubricating oils include animal oils,
