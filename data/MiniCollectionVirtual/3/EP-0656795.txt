<ABSTRACT>
Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is used as an adjunctive or stand alone procedure for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. When used as an adjunctive therapy to Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty, laser angioplasty, atherectomy, stenting, or any other interventional or surgical procedure, it has been found that the treatment timing is critical to the success of the combined therapies. A photosensitizer is administered prior to the surgical or interventional procedure and then readministered after the procedure to maintain the photosensitizer concentration level in the atheromatous plaque and smooth muscle cells in the vicinity of the lesion for a period of about 5-18 days, the period in which cell proliferation can occur. The photosensitizer inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and, thus, minimizes or eliminates the possibility of re-stenosis. The photosensitizer is then illuminated at the end of this period, thereby lysing the atheromatous plaque and smooth muscles. The photosensitizer inhibits atheromatic smooth muscle cell proliferation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR TREATING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE THROUGH ADJUNCTIVE PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to treatment of cardiovascular disease generally, and more particularly to treatment of atherosclerosis through adjunctive photodynamic therapy.Atherosclerosis is a cardiovascular disease in which deposits of plaques (atheromas) containing cholesterol, lipid material, foam cells, lipophages, and proliferating smooth muscle cells are within the intima and media of large to small diameter arteries such as the aorta and the iliac, femoral, coronary, and cerebral arteries. The resultant stenosis causes reduction in blood flow.Attempts to treat atherosclerosis have included by- pass surgery wherein the diseased vascular segments are augmented by prosthetic or natural grafts. This procedure requires general anesthesia and a substantial healing period after surgery and, thus, is generally limited to cases of severe coronary artery disease. Other approaches for primary treatment of stenotic vessels include percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) , atherectomy, stenting and newer modalities of cardiovascular intervention including laser angioplasty. The primary drawbacks of these methods has been re-stenosis. Studies have shown that re-stenosis, or the re-narrowing of the internal lumen of an artery, subsequent to such primary 

treatment occurs in about 25-50% of cases where such primary treatment is performed. The result of re-stenosis is the requirement for. an additional interventional or surgical procedure. Various mechanisms can cause re-stenosis. One mechanism is rapid smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation at the lesion site. Smooth muscle cell proliferation is believed to occur immediately or at any time up to several hours after vessel wall injury that results from primary atherosclerotic treatment such as angioplasty. This proliferation continues for about 5-18 days depending on the individual. The cause of this rapid smooth muscle cell proliferation is believed to involve the release of various growth factors in response to the vessel wall injury. Specifically, after such vessel wall injury, some smooth muscle cells migrate to the intima where they are affected by the blood elements with which they come in contact, especially platelets and lipoproteins. Platelets contain a factor that stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, which can result in re-stenosis. Accordingly, there is a need to address the problem of smooth muscle cell

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for treatment of atherosclerosis comprising the steps of: administering an effective amount of a photosensitizing agent into a mammal such that the agent accumulates in atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells and atherosclerotic plaque adjacent said cells; readministering said agent to prevent photosensitizing agent from being substantially cleared from the said atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells for a period of at least about 5 days; and exposing the photosensitizing agent within said atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells and plaque to light such that said cells and plaque are lysed.
2. The method of claim 2 wherein said photosensitizing agent is Tin Ethyl Etiopurpurin.
3. A method for treatment of atherosclerosis comprising the steps of: detecting atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells and plaque in a mammal; administering an effective amount of a photosensitizing agent into the mammal such that the agent accumulates in the atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells and plaque; 


 widening the lumen of the vessel that has narrowed due to the accumulation of the atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells and plaque; and readministering said agent to prevent photosensitizing agent from being substantially cleared from the atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells for a period of at least about five days.
4. A method for treatment of atherosclerosis comprising the steps of: widening the lumen of a vessel that has narrowed due to accumulation of atheromatous plaque; and blocking the growth factor binding sites on the atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells injured during the widening step until growth factor is no longer released from the platelets in the vicinity of the injured cells.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein the blocking step is performed continuously for a period of at least about 5 days.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein the blocking step is commenced immediately after the widening step.
7. The method of claim 4 wherein the blocking step is continuous and commenced immediately after the widening step. 


 8. The method of claim 7 wherein the blocking step is accomplished by introducing an effective amount of a photosensitizing agent in the region of the vessel subject to the widening step such that the agent accumulates in the injured smooth muscle cells.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the photosensitizing agent is administered such that photosensitizing agent accumulates in the atheromatous plaque.
10. The method of claim 9 further including the step of exposing the photosensitizing agent within the atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells and plaque to light such that said cells and plaque are lysed.
11. The method of claim 8 wherein the photosensitizing agent is a Tin Ethyl Etiopurpurin.
12. The method of claim 8 further including the step of exposing the photosensitizing agent within the atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells to light such that the atherosclerotic smooth muscle cells are lysed.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the exposing step is commenced after growth factor is no longer released from the platelets in the vicinity of the injured cells. 


 14. The method of claim 13 wherein the exposing step is commenced within a range of about 5-16 days after the widening step.
