<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
water-repellent articles by forming a water-repellent film on
the surface of a substrate of, for example, glass, ceramics,
plastics, metal or the like, water-repellent articles obtained
by the method, and a solution for forming the water-repellent
film.In forming a water-repellent film on the surface of a
substrate such as glass or the like, the technique is known to
form an undercoat of silicon oxide or the like between the
substrate and the water-repellent layer in order to improve the
bonding strength of the substrate with the water-repellent film
and prevent the diffusion of an alkali component where the
substrate contains the alkali component, thereby enhancing the
durability of the water-repellent film.As techniques for forming a water-repellent film having
such an undercoat there have been known two techniques, i.e.,
technique which comprises forming an undercoat of silicon oxide
or the like on a substrate, and then forming a water-repellent
film on the undercoat to produce a two-layer structure and
technique which comprises applying a mixture of an undercoat
composition and a water-repellent component to a substrate, 
thereby forming a single layer comprising of an undercoat layer
and a water-repellent layer. The latter technique requires
less producing steps and thus exhibits better productivity than
the former. Examples of the latter technique include those
disclosed in JP-B-63-24554 (The term "JP-B" as used herein
means an "examined Japanese patent publication"), JP-A-61-215235
(The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
Japanese patent application"), JP-A-64-68477, JP-A-64-68477,
JP-A-4-338137, and JP-A-8-239653. The feature of these
techniques will be described below.JP-B-63-24554 discloses a water-repellent surface
treating agent obtained by modifying a silanol oligomer
(eicosamer to tetracontamer) with a fluoroalkylsilane.JP-A-61-215235 discloses a water-repellent, stain-resistant
low reflectance glass obtained by a process which
comprises applying to the surface of a substrate a solution
obtained by allowing a fluoroalkyl group-containing silane
compound and a silane coupling agent to undergo hydrolysis
reaction in an alcoholic solvent in the presence of acetic acid
and an organic tin compound to produce a co-condensate, and
then heat curing the coating.JP-A-64-68477 discloses a process for the production of
a water-repellent steel plate which comprises applying an
alcohol solution containing an alkoxide such as silicon
