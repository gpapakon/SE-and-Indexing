<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical instruments. More
particularly, this invention relates to surgical
instruments for probing body cavities and manipulating
tissue contained therein under continuous observation.U.S. Patents 4,963,147; 4,962,770; and 5,089,000
describe a surgical instrument which is very useful in
techniques for carpal tunnel release and is also useful in
other surgical techniques. The instrument includes a probe
in which a cutting blade and an optical system are
disposed. After the probe has been inserted into a body
cavity the cutting blade is extended through a lateral
aperture in the probe to a position adjacent the selected
tissue, while allowing the tissue manipulation to be
observed.In the surgical instrument just described the cutting
blade extends through an axially fixed rotatable pivot pin.
As an actuation shaft urges the cutting blade through the
pivot pin, the distal end portion of the blade sweeps
through an arc to reach a fully extended position.
Initially the distal tip of the blade moves toward the
distal end of the probe and then moves upwardly to its
fully extended position. This forward movement of the tip
of the blade can be undesirable because the tip can
encounter tissue which is not intended to be cut. Also,
the tip of the blade is not easily visible as it is being
elevated. According to a first aspect of this invention there is
provided a disposable probe as claimed in claim 1 herein.According to a further aspect of this invention there
is provided a surgical instrument including a probe in
accordance with the first aspect and as claimed in claim 19
herein.Other advantages of this invention will be apparent
from the following detailed description and the
accompanying drawings.The invention is described in more detail hereinafter
with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like
reference characters refer to the same parts throughout the
several views and in which:

embodiment of surgical probe of this invention;Figure 2 is a top view of the surgical probe of Figure
