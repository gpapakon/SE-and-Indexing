Process for the automatic loading of a machine for 
sewing the puckers on knitted garments of the close-fitting 

type, characterized by the fact that it comprises, in the 
order given, the following phases: 


slipping a close-fitting garment onto a tubular 
support (100) caused to perform an alternating vertical movement 

and an alternating rotatory movement about a horizontal axis; 
placing the said support (100) in the vertical position 
and causing the garment thus positioned to continue to adhere 

tightly to the support by means of a flow of air derived by 
suction from the interior of the said support; 
raising the said support (100) to a level enabling the 
garment to be secured by corresponding means (110) activated by 

the support (100) itself; 
forming the perineal opening in the garment thus 
secured; 
removing the resulting fabric from the said perineal 
opening of the garment; 
raising the said support (100) still farther until the 
corresponding garment occupies the position enabling it to be 

gripped by corresponding means (25,31) mounted on each of the 
heads of the pucker sewing machine; 
activating the said pucker gripping means (25,31) to 
enable it to be transferred to a corresponding head (27) of the 

machine; 
interrupting the suction intake from the interior of 
the said tubular support (100); 
lowering the said support (100) and thus de-activating 
the said garment securing means (110);  

 
causing the body of the garment to enter the corresponding 
head (27) of the machine by suction; 
tilting the bottom of the said tubular support (100) 
to enable a further garment to be mounted; 
cutting the aforementioned perineal opening; 
sewing the perineal reinforcement pucker of the 
garment; 
turning over the garment; 
cutting and taking in by suction the annular portion 
of fabric which was removed by the cutting of the perineal 

opening; 
de-activating the aforementioned garment gripping 
means (25,31) in order to enable the garment to be discharged. 
Apparatus for the automatic loading of a machine for 
sewing the puckers on knitted garments of the close-fitting type 

in accordance with the process described in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that it comprises: 


a tubular support head (100) for the body of a close-fitting 
garment, with an annular chamber (1) connected to a 

suction collector (2) with an annular electrical resistance (9), 
serving to cut off the edge of the opening intended for the 

pucker in the garment, and with a pipe (8) situated underneath 
the resistance (9) and serving to remove by suction the fabric 

thus detached from the garment; 
means for vertically moving the said head in both 
directions alternately, with an associated actuating cylinder 

(101) with a vertical axis, of which the rod (102) is attached 
to the lower base of a support carriage (103) of the head (100); 
means for moving the said head (100) around a horizontal 
axis, i.e. orthogonally to the sliding direction of the head (100),  

 
in both directions alternately, with an associated actuating 

cylinder (104) affixed to the carriage (103) and with a lever 
(106) connected by one end to the rod of the cylinder (104) 

and by the diametrically opposite end to the head (100) in such 
a way that the extraction and retraction respectively of the 

said rod (105) causes the lever (106) and simultaneously 
therewith the head (100) to rotate in the clockwise direction 

and in the opposite direction respectively; 
a collar (110) positioned above and coaxially with 
the said head (100), to lock the fabric situated above, in 

conjunction with the suction in the chamber (1), during the 
operation of loading the head (27) of the pucker sewing machine, 

the said collar (110) being affixed to an associated carriage 
(111) subjected to an alternating vertical movement, i.e. an 

ascending and descending movement, synchronously with the 
ascending and descending movement of the head (100), so that 

it occupies the garment locking position when the head is raised 
in order to feed the machine and the garment releasing position 

when the suction is activated in the head (27) of the said 
machine; 
means for supporting the garments on each head (27) 
of the pucker sewing machine, with the same number of counter-cones 

(25), each of which is mounted on a tube (26) with a vertical 
axis to the lower end of which is affixed a corresponding head 

(27) of the machine; 
means for gripping the garment, with an annular 
elastic clamp, normally closed, for each head (27), supported 

by an associated counter-cone (25);  
 
fixed cam means (400) for effecting the ascending and 
lowering movement respectively of the said counter-cones (25); 
pneumatic means (450) for the activation of the 

said clamps (31), the said means being positioned in accordance 
with the loading and return stations respectively for the 

manufactured product; 
means for cutting off and discharging the waste 
material generated in the course of the operation of cutting 

the perineal opening, with an electrical resistance (40) and 
a suction tube (38), which are caused to perform an alternating 

approach and departure movement respectively in relation to the 
corresponding head (27); 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that the side wall of the said head (100) is provided 

with a number of transversal holes (4) as a means of communication 
between the chamber (1) and the suction collector (2), so that 

the fabric of the garment will adhere completely thereto during 
the operation of loading the machine. 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that the said carriage (111) is provided with elastic 

means opposing the ascending movement and with a lower thrust-block 
element with an associated operating cylinder (114) 

serving to prevent it from being lowered beyond a certain 
predetermined level. 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that the mouth of the said tube is shaped to form a 

nozzle. 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that the said annular electrical resistance (9) is 

affixed to the upper ends of two parallel bars (12) which slide  
 

on an insulated guide (13) parallel to the axis (a) of the 
head (100) under the control of an associated pneumatic cylinder 

(14). 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 4, characterized 
by the fact that the said carriage (111) is supported by the head 

(100) itself. 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that the said means for moving the head (100) comprise 

a number of further operating cylinders to enable the working 
load to be evenly distributed and correctly placed in the 

positions for mounting the body of the garment and raising it 
in order to produce the perineal opening and feed the pucker 

sewing machine. 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that the heads (27) of the machine, the counter-cones 

(25) and the elastic clamps (31) are fitted with a number of pins 
(200) projecting beyond the said heads (27) in the radial direction, 

the said pins (200) being slidably mounted in corresponding 
grooves parallel to the axis of the corresponding heads (27), 

in order to facilitate the removal of the waste material (300) 
generated during the cutting of the opening in the garment, the 

said pins (200) being positioned above the respective clamps (31) 
in the position for the transfer of the garment from the head 

(100) to the corresponding head (27) and below the clamps (31) 
and counter-cones (25) in the positions corresponding to the 

application of the pucker and the discharge of the garment.
