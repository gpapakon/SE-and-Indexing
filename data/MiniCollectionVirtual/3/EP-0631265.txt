<ABSTRACT>
Circuit arrangement for an optical detector, using the transmitted-light principle, for environmental monitoring and indication of a disturbing medium (gas or smoke), having a light source which irradiates both a measuring photoelectric cell (photoelectric tube, photoemissive detector) (11) via a measured-beam path which is subject to the disturbing medium, and a reference photoelectric cell (12) via a reference beam path which is kept free from the disturbing medium, a comparison signal being derived from comparing the received signals emitted by the measuring photoelectric cell and the reference photoelectric cell. The received signals (measured signal, reference signal) are fed, after their conversion into corresponding binary signals, to a computer which, in the case of a measured-beam path which is free of any disturbing medium, initially stores as correction value, for correcting an error in the comparison signal, a determined difference of the binary signals and, during the following environmental monitoring step, corrects, by means of this correction value, the comparison signal determined during this step.

<CLAIMS>
A circuit arrangement for an optical detector (1)
operating according to the transmitted light principle

for environmental monitoring and indication of a
disturbing medium (gas or smoke), including a light

source (L1, L2; L3, L4, L5) which irradiates both a
measuring photocell (11, 15) by way of a measuring beam

exposed to the disturbing medium and a reference
photocell (12, 16) by way of a reference beam kept free

from the disturbing medium, whereby a comparison signal
is derived from the comparison of the reception signals

delivered by the measuring photocell (11, 15) and the

reference photocell (12, 16), 
characterized in that

the reception signals (measuring signal 31, reference
signal 32), after having been converted into

corresponding binary signals, are supplied to a
computer R which, when the measuring beam is free from

disturbing medium, for correction of an error of the
comparison signal initially stores a determined

difference of the binary signals as correction value
and in the following environmental monitoring corrects

with said correction value the comparison signal then
determined.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that
 to generate the comparison signal
in the environmental monitoring, the computer (R)

combines the measurement signal and the reference
signal in such a way that the comparison signal is

constantly corrected by the correction value.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,

characterized in that
 the determination of the 
correction value is initiated by a command (55)

transmitted to the computer (R).
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 3,

characterized in that
 at regular intervals the computer
(R) itself initiates (U) the command for determination

of the correction value.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1
to 4, 
characterized in that
 an alarm-triggering
response threshold of the comparison signal is altered

by a command separately transmitted to the computer
(R).
