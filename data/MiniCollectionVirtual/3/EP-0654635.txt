<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steam generator comprising an orifice for feeding water to a porous material (109), a heating element (192) passing through this porous material and an outlet orifice for the steam created by heating this water, the generator being characterised in that the porous material and its heating element are contained in an envelope (18) arranged in a sealed cassette (10) which is removable and connected during functioning to a fixed part of the generator (12, 14) containing means for feeding water, means for controlling the heating element and means for taking off steam. The sealed cassette is connected to the fixed part of the generator by means of clips (20) so as to allow rapid connection and disconnection and it comprises an orifice for admission of the water connected to an internal envelope containing an element for heating the water around which a porous material is compressed, this envelope comprising over its entire surface orifices (188) for removal of the steam produced by the heating element and the steam being extracted from the cassette via a steam outlet orifice.

A steam generator comprising a case (18) which contains a porous
material (190) and a heater element (192) passing through said porous material

(190), the case (18) being itself disposed in an enclosure (10) that is connected in
operation to water feed means, means for controlling the heater element, and

means for taking off the steam created by heating the water injected into the
enclosure, characterised in that the case (10) constitutes a removable sealed

cassette that is connected by means of clamps (20) suitable for enabling rapid
connection and disconnection to a fixed portion of the generator (12, 14)

containing said water feed means, said means for controlling the heater elements,
and said means for taking off the steam.
A steam generator according to claim 1, characterised in that the
water feed means comprise an external tank (60) and a pump (50) placed between

the tank and the water feed orifice, and enabling water to be selectively injected
into the generator.
A steam generator according to claim 2, characterised in that the
water pumped from the tank (60) is injected into the top portion of the cassette (10)

by means of a spray strip (19).
A steam generator according to claim 1, characterised in that the
water feed means comprise manual filling means (26) having a siphon (260) for

limiting the depth to which water can be filled in the cassette.
A steam generator according to claim 4, characterised in that the
manual filling means further comprise means (264) for interrupting heating and

water feed, which means are controlled by rotation of a filler stopper (266) placed
at the inlet of said filler means.
A steam generator according to claim 1, characterised in that it
further comprises steam regulator means (36) at the outlet from the cassette (10).
A steam generator according to claim 1, characterised in that it
further comprises visible indicators (420) or audible indicators (410) for

monitoring water level, planeness, and clogging by scale of the cassette (10).
A steam generator according to claim 7, characterised in that
clogging by scale is monitored by a device (40) for measuring the conductivity of

the water prior to evaporation, which device is connected to the cassette (10).
A removable steam cassette designed to be implemented with a
steam generator according to any one of claims 1 to 8, comprising an extended 

outer enclosure, a water inlet duct (24) distributing said water to an internal case
(18) containing a heater element for heating said water (192), a first porous

material (190) being compressed around the heater element, said case including

orifices (188) over its entire surface for evacuating the steam produced by the
heater element, the steam being expelled from the cassette via a steam outlet

orifice (30), and the removable cassette being fitted with clamps (20) for enabling
rapid connection and disconnection from the box constituting the outer enclosure

of the cassette with respect to the fixed portion (12, 14) of the steam generator.
A removable steam cassette according to claim 9, characterised in
that it comprises shutter means (28) for shutting the water admission orifice and

activated when the pressure inside the cassette is less than a determined pressure.
A removable steam cassette according to claim 9, characterised in
that it further comprises a second porous material (18b) that is separated from the

first porous material (18a) surrounding the heater element (192) by a wall (196)
extending between two opposite sides of the cassette and leaving an empty space

for the passage of steam, the second porous material (18b) which constitutes a trap
for scale being soaked by means of a spray strip (19) directly with the water

pumped from the tank.
A removable steam cassette according to claim 11, characterised in
that the wall (196) includes orifices (198) providing communication between the

evaporation zone that contains the first porous material (18a) and the water feed
zone that contains the second porous material (18b), thereby enabling the first

porous material to be irrigated with partially descaled water that has passed
through the second porous material.
A removable steam cassette according to claim 9, characterised in
that the first porous material and the heater element are integrated in a ring (200)

that is advantageously made of plastics material, that is concentric with the outer
enclosure of the cassette (10) and that has a free cylinder in its center into which a

steam outlet tube (202) secured to said circular outer enclosure plunges to about
half-depth.
A removable steam cassette according to any one of claims 9, 11
and 13, characterised in that the case (18) is made up of two separable half-boxes

(180, 182; 200) having pierced top and bottom faces in order to make it easy to
replace the porous material or the heater elements.
A removable steam cassette according to any one of claims 9, 11
and 13, characterised in that the heater element (192) for the water circulating 

through the porous material is selected from the elements of the following group: a
heater resistance element, a ceramic resistance, and electrodes.
A removable steam cassette according to claim 9, characterised in
that the water heater element is constituted by a ceramic resistance (210) inserted

in the center of a diffuser element (212) made of a heat-conducting material, the
first porous material (216) being engaged under pressure between at least three fins

(214a to 214d) of said diffuser and being held in place by the perforated internal
case (218).
A removable steam cassette according to any one of claims 9 to 16,
characterised in that it includes high and low water level detection means detecting

the levels for co-operating with means (40) for monitoring said levels and present
in the fixed portion of the generator.
A removable steam cassette according to claim 17, characterised in
that, in order to determine the presence of a determined level of water in the

enclosure, said detection means further include a set of electrical contacts
including both the screening of the heater element (192) and a metal strip (204)
