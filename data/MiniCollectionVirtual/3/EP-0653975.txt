<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pocket tool
with retractable pliers capable of being moved into an
exposed operating position by inertial, e.g., centrifugal,
force using a single hand. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a multi-function pocket tool which
includes, in a single, compact unit, jaws and various
other selected tools.In general, multi-function tools, including in a
single instrument, pliers, and other selected tools, such
as screwdrivers, knife blades, files, scissors and the
like are well known. The prior art tools typically
include a crossjaw pliers with channel-shaped handles
pivotally connected to the shanks (tangs) of the
respective plier jaws. The handles fold over the pliers
so that the pliers are received in the handle channels.
Respective tools, channel-shaped handle extensions, or
both, are pivotally mounted to each handle at the distal
end, adapted to fall into the handle channel or nest
within the handle, respectively, for storage. Examples of
such multiple tools are described in U.S. Patents
4,238,862, 4,744,272, and 4,888,869, issued on December
16, 1980, May 17, 1988, and December 26, 1989,
respectively, to Timothy S. Leatherman.Such tools are disadvantageous in that the use
of both hands is required to unfold the handles from the
nested storage position to expose the plier jaws.
Likewise, both hands are required to return the plier jaws 
to the nested storage position. This tends to limit the
utility of the tool in some circumstances.In addition, when the handles are unfolded from
the pliers, the open channel in which the pliers are
received when in a folded position face outwardly. Thus,
unless special provisions are made, typically involving
the additional step of unfolding or pivoting a handle
extension or sleeve, the open edges of the channel sides
address the user's hand. This makes the pliers
particularly uncomfortable to use.Mechanisms for locking the handles of such tools
in a particular position are also known. An example of
such a locking mechanism is disclosed in the
aforementioned U.S. Patent 4,238,862 to Leatherman.
However, such mechanisms typically must be specifically
released before the handles can be further opened and,
thus, are not particularly suitable for maintaining the
handles in a closed position when the pliers are stored or
an ancillary tool is in use.The present invention provides a multi-function
tool including jaws which can be selectively stored within
the handles thereof, and can be exposed, or retracted for
storage,

working portion (38) and a tang (42) interconnected by a bearing

portion (40), said jaws (12A, 12B) being pivotally connected at said
bearing portions (40) to form said cross-jaws (12);
first and second handles (14A, 14B), each including an
internal channel therein; the tool being 
characterized in that
 it comprises:

means for slidably coupling said tangs (42) to
said handles (14A, 14B) for selective movement within said handle

channels between
an extended position in which said jaw
working portions (38) are disposed forward of said

handles (14) and are capable of pivotal movement
with respect to each other in response to

divergence and convergence of said handles (14);
and
a retracted position in which said

working portions (38) are at least partially
contained within said handle channels such

that said working portions (38) are prevented from
substantial pivotal motion relative to each

other, and said handles (14) are prevented from
substantially diverging

the jaws (12) being capable of being moved into an exposed operating
position by a single hand using inertial force.
The tool of claim 1, wherein said means
for slidably coupling said tang (42) to said handles (14A, 14B) comprises at least one

longitudinal slot (26) of predetermined width formed in one
of said handles (14A or 14B), and a fastener (64, 66) coupled to the tang (42)

disposed in the handle channel, said fastener (64, 66) including
a portion extending through said slot (26), disposed for

sliding movement therein.
The tool of claim 2, wherein said handle (14A, 14B)
includes a web (20) and respective side panels (22, 24), said web (20) 

interconnecting said side panels (22, 24) to define said handle
channel, and said slot (26) is formed in said handle web (20).
