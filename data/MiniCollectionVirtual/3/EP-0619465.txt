<ABSTRACT>
A method of and an apparatus for drying/curing a dry 
material such as a mat of fibrous or powder material as may 

be used for building purpose as well as a non-dry material 
such as a thermosetting resin are disclosed. The disclosure 

relates to the sealing function during the drying/curing 
step. The apparatus comprises a heating and blowing 

mechanism for drying/curing a mat as it is being conveyed by 
a conveyor mechanism including pair of upper and lower 

conveyors, and shield mechanism for shielding between the 
conveyor mechanism and the heating and blowing mechanism. The 

shield mechanism includes wire brushes on blowing boxes of 
the heating and blowing mechanism for abutment against 

caterpillar plates of forward runs of respective conveyors to 
seal between the caterpillar plates of the forward runs and 

the blowing boxes. Any powder or particles which may be 
developed during the drying/curing step is trapped by the 

wire brush, which is then effective to prevent a leakage of a 
hot air, thus assuring an even pressure of hot air supplied. 

The wire brushes are disposed in a plurality of rows and 
divided into stationary and movable ones. By moving the 

movable wire brushes for movement toward or away from 
abutment against the caterpillar plates of the forward runs, 

selected flexible caulking members are operated to provide a 
variable shielded width.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of and an apparatus
for drying/curing dry materials such as mats of fibrous or
powder material as may be used for building purpose as well
as a non-dry material such as thermosetting resin, and in
particular, a method of and an apparatus for manufacturing a
mat used for building purpose which is characterized in the
seal for hot air thereof during the drying/curing step.Generally, a molded mat used for building purpose is
subject to a drying or curing step in a drier before it is
finished to a final product. A band drier is typically used
at this end.A conventional band drier comprises a pair of oppositely
disposed, upper and lower conveyers, each of which is housed
in an upper or lower oven. Each conveyor comprises an
endless chain disposed to run around a pair of sprockets and
having a plurality of caterpillar plates with ventilation
openings formed therein mounted thereon. A drive sprocket is
driven for rotation by a drive source in each of the
conveyors, and the mat is held between and coveyed by the 
forward runs of caterpillar plates of the respective
conveyors as the sprockets rotate.Heating and blowing mechanism is disposed above and
below the caterpillar plates of the forward runs of the upper
and lower conveyors, and operates to introduce a hot air from
a heated source into the associated oven by means of a
blower, and to cause it to circulate through the caterpillar
plates of the respective forward runs and the mat being
conveyed, thereby drying/curing the mat. The heating and
blowing mechanism comprises a series of alternately arranged
high and low pressure blowing boxes which are disposed along
the direction of conveyance between the caterpillar plates of
the forward and the return run of each conveyor, and a path
for the hot air is defined by a high pressure blowing box and
a corresponding low pressure blowing box of respective
conveyors. The upper conveyor and upper blowing boxes are
vertically adjustable in accordance with the thickness of the
mat.A conventional band drier may be exemplified by an
arrangement disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,028,051 in which
narrow paths are provided between the caterpillar plates and
the blowing boxes in order to increase a pressure
differential between the high and the low pressure blowing
box so that the passage of the hot air through the mat is
facilitated, thereby assuring an even drying/curing of both 
the front and the rear side of the mat.These narrow paths are provided to prevent damages by
thermal distortion

A method of manufacturing a mat (M) for building
purpose including steps of conveying a mat by holding it

sandwiched between a pair of upper (2) and lower (1)
conveyors, feeding a hot air from a flower source (35) to one

of blowing boxes (33, 34) disposed above or below the
conveying surface of the lower or upper conveyor during the

conveyance of the mat, and passing the hot air through the
upper (2) and the lower (1) conveyor and through the mat (M)

which is held therebetween and thence to another blowing box
(34) for circulation, thereby drying/curing the mat; providing

a caulking member disposed between the conveyor (1) and the
