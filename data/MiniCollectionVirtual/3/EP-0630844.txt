<ABSTRACT>
An improved sheet feeder mechanism includes a D-shaped roller 
(16) that is mounted on a shaft (18) and is positioned transversely to a direction 

(20) of sheet feed. A D-roller gear (22) is mounted on the shaft (18) and has 
both a non-recessed geared region and a recessed non-geared region (24) that 

extends partially about a circumference of the D-roller gear (22). A shaft 
extension (30) extends from and is attached to the shaft (18), and a spring (34) 

engages the shaft extension (30) to cause the shaft (18) and the D-roller gear 
(22) to rotate to a position that enables a gear drive (26, 28) to engage the non-recessed 

geared region of the D-roller gear (22). A spiral cam assembly (42) is 
mounted for rotation with the gear drive (26, 28) and includes a spiral cam (52) 

that is positioned between and resiliently bears upon inner and outer annuli (50, 
48) of the cam assembly (44). A control arm (40) engages both the spiral cam 

(52) and the shaft extension (30) and is responsive to rotation in a first direction 
of the cam assembly (42) to enable the spring (34) to move the shaft extension 

(30) and D-roller gear (22) to a position where a non-recessed, geared region 
aligns with the gear drive (26, 28). The control arm (30) is further responsive 

to rotation in a second direction of the cam assembly (42), after the first 
direction rotation, to enable rotation of the D-roller gear (22) by the gear drive 

(26, 28) so as to cause a sheet feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sheet feed mechanisms, and more 
particularly, to a single-revolution sheet feed mechanism employing a paper pick 
roller and a non-slip driving mechanism. While there are many existing designs for sheet feed mechanisms, 
one of the more popular designs employed in copiers, facsimiles, etc. is shown 
in Fig. 1. Sheets 10 to be individually fed, are positioned in a tray 12 and are 
held in position by separators 14. A D-shaped roller 16 is mounted for rotation 
on a shaft 18. A single clockwise rotation of D-shaped roller 16 will cause a 
single sheet 10 to be fed in the direction indicated by arrow 20. D-shaped roller 
is also called a paper-pick roller. Shaft 18 is connected to a D-roller gear 22 that has a section 24 
wherein the gear teeth have been removed (gear teeth are shown 
schematically). A mating drive gear 26 is mounted on a drive shaft 28 that is in 
turn connected to a bi-directional drive motor (not shown). The portion of shaft 18 to the right of D-roller gear 22 has a 
radially extending shaft extension 30 which, in cooperation with leaf spring 32 
and solenoid 34, enables shaft 18 to make a single revolution and accomplish 
the feeding of a single sheet. Leaf spring 32 bears against shaft extension 30 
and biases it in a clockwise direction. An armature 36 is spring biased to 
engage shaft extension 30 and in that position, prevents clockwise rotation of shaft 
18. To enable the feeding of a sheet, solenoid 34 is actuated and 
withdraws armature 36 from engagement with shaft extension 30. This action 
frees shaft extension 30 to be acted upon by spring 32. Once shaft extension 
30 has just passed armature 36, solenoid 34 is disengaged to enable armature 
36 to re-engage shaft extension 30 at the end of a single rotation of D-roller 
shaft 18. A subsequent energization of the drive motor causes shaft 28 to  
 
rotate in a counterclockwise direction, thus enabling drive gear 26 to rotate D-roller 
gear 22 (and shaft 18) in a clockwise direction. The resulting rotation of 
D-roller 16 engages a sheet 10 and moves it in the direction shown by arrow 
20. When recessed portion 24 of D-roller gear 22 reaches drive gear 26, drive 
gear 26 and D-roller gear 22 disengage. Armature 36 again engages shaft 
extension 30 at the end of a single rotation. Others have attempted to reduce the cost of the sheet feed 
mechanism shown in Fig. 1 by eliminating solenoid 34 and mounting a slip 
clutch on shaft 18. The slip clutch is dependent upon controlled friction 
between the

(18) positioned transversely to a direction (20) of sheet feed;
 
   a D-roller gear (22) mounted on said shaft (18) and having a 

geared region and recessed region (24) that extends partially about 
a circumference of said D-roller gear (22);
 
   gear drive means (26, 28) for engaging said geared region 

of said D-roller gear (22) and causing rotation of said D-roller gear 
(22), said shaft (18) and said D-roller (16);
 
   a shaft extension (30) extending from said shaft 

(18); and
 
   spring means (32) engaging said shaft extension (30) for 

causing said shaft extension (30), shaft (18) and D-roller gear (22) 
to rotate to a position that enables said gear drive means (26, 28) 

to engage said geared portion of said D-roller gear (22);

said control arm means (40) includes a second stop (66), said second stop (66) 

positioned, when said cam means (42) is rotated in said first direction so as to 
cause said arm to bring said first stop (64) out of engagement with said shaft 

extension (30), said second stop (66) intercepting said shaft extension (30) 
during movement thereof by said spring means (32) and positioning said geared 

region of said D-roller gear (22) for engagement by said gear drive means (26, 
28).  

 
The sheet feeder as recited in Claim 5, wherein movement 
of said arm of said control arm means (40) by rotation of said cam means (42) 

in said second direction, after rotation of said cam means (42) in said first 
direction, causes said second stop (66) to be brought out of engagement with 

said shaft extension (30) and enables rotation of said shaft extension (30), shaft 
(18), D-roller gear (22) and D-roller (16) by said gear drive means (26, 28) to
