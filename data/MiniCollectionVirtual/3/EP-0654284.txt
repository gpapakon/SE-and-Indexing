<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a thermoplastic polyurethane 
elastomer tube, comprising 


(a) extruding a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer on the 
periphery of a heated mandrel under pressurization, 
(b) pulling out the mandrel to give a tube preform, and 
(c) hot drawing the obtained tube preform to produce a tube 
having a desired outer diameter, wherein

 
the temperature of the said mandrel and an extrusion pressure on 

the elastomer are set in such a manner that they fall within 
the range where a range permitting hot drawing of the tube 

preform and a range free from the occurrence of bubbles on the 
surface of the tube preform overlap, which ranges being 

determined in advance on the basis of the temperature of the 
heated mandrel and the extrusion pressure on the elastomer as 

parameters. The method of the present invention can provide a 
TPU tube having a fine hot drawability while overcoming poor 

appearance due to the occurrence of bubbles or granular 
structure. In addition, TPU tubes having stable quality are 

continuously produced, thus increasing the yield thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved production of 
a tube composed of a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer 
(hereinafter also referred to as TPU) by the so-called 
pressurizing method. The medical tubes such as cannula, catheter etc. are 
generally inserted into blood vessels (particularly coronary 
artery), trachea, oviduct, urinary duct and various organs for 
the injection of liquids, patency of ducts and so on. These 
medical tubes are mainly made of TPU and the tip thereof is 
formed thin in a taper shape by hot drawing so as to facilitate 
insertion thereof into organs etc. The method for forming a tube inclusive of such medical 
tube is exemplified by a method wherein TPU extruded from the 
delivery end of a die head is coated on a mandrel (hereinafter 
referred to as tubing method). A partial cross section of the 
die head to be used for the tubing method is shown in Fig. 3. 
In the tubing method, a mandrel 11 passing along an axial core 
10a in a die head 10 is fed to the direction of an arrow b 
while a TPU 12 delivered from an extruder (not shown) is 
supplied into the die head 10, defined to a predetermined 
thickness and extruded from between a die 13 and a nipple 14, 
as shown in Fig. 3. Since the diameter of the TPU 12 at a  
 
delivery end 10b of the die head 10 is greater than that of the 
mandrel 11 by the thickness of the nipple 14, the TPU 12 falls 
to cover the mandrel 11. In the tubing method, however, covering of mandrel 11 by 
TPU 12 under the open pressure is responsible for possible 
development of bubbles on the surface of the extruded product 
of TPU 12. For avoiding the development of the bubbles, the 
extrusion temperature of TPU 12 needs to be lowered, which in 
turn results in insufficient melting of TPU 12 to often cause 
occurrence of a granular structure (development of knob-like 
humps of from several dozens to several hundred Âµm in diameter 
which appear on the surface as a result of the reaction in TPU 
to form a linear polymer having a higher molecular weight). 
Accordingly, it is not possible to prevent poor appearance due 
to the occurrence of bubbles or granular structure by the tubing 
method. Another exemplification of the method for forming a tube is 
a method comprising extrusion-coating a mandrel with TPU in a 
die head (hereinafter referred to as pressurizing method). A 
partial cross section of the die head to be used for the 
pressurizing method is shown in Fig. 2. In the pressurizing 
method, a mandrel 2 passing along an axial core 1a in a
