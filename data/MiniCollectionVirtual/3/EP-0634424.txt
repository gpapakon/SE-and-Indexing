<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel olefin polymer composed of the reaction product of a 
functionalized polypropylene and a polyetheramine. This invention also relates to 
thermoplastic resin blends containing the novel olefin polymer and polypropylene. The in-situ formation of compatibilizers for polyblends is rapidly gaining popularity. 
In the last few years, more and more cases have been reported where advantage is taken of 
the presence of reactive groups to form a graft or a block or a random copolymer, which 
could act as a compatabilizer for a mixture of two or more polymers. The prior art, Process 
Requirements of the Reactive Compatibilization of Nylon 6/ Polypropylene Blends by S.S. 
Dagli, M. Xanthos and J.A. Biensenberger: Polymer Processing Institute at Stevens Institute 
of Technology, Hoboken, N.J. 07030 reveals an acrylic acid grafted modified polypropylene 
used with a blend of nylon-6 and polypropylene. Thermoplastic resin compositions containing polypropylene are well known in the art 
(e.g. US patent 5,208,081). U.S. Patent 5,179,164 describes a polypropylene/polyamide 
composition suitable for producing moldings. The patent describes an ethylene copolymer 
useful as an adhesion promoter. Moreover, the patent indicates that maleic acid is a suitable 
monomer for preparing the ethylene copolymer. In addition, maleated polypropylene is commercially available.  
 European patent application 0 367 832 discloses a resin composition containing an 
olefinic polymer having acid anhydride groups. As in U.S. Patent 5,179,164, the novel 
compound is blended with a polyamide. Japanese patent 46003838 reveals a maleic anhydride modified polypropylene 
composition containing triethylamine and polyethylene glycol nonylphenyl ether. Japanese 
patent 60195120 reveals a molding containing polyethylene, maleic anhydride-grafted 
polyethylene, and diethylenetriamine. However, the instant invention uses the maleic anhydride in conjunction with 
polyetheramines which produce unexpected improvements in resin properties. This invention is a compound comprising a blend of polypropylene with the reaction 
product of a functionalized polypropylene and polyether amine in which the polyether amine 
is grafted onto the functionalized polypropylene in a customery mixing apparatus. This 
invention is also a process for producing the reaction product of the functionalized 
polypropylene and the polyether amine by melting with polypropylene in a customary mixing 
apparatus.
