<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are disclosed for 
processing and displaying objects to permit a search of 

a database by a user of a telephone station. The 
telephone station includes a computer, a display device 

having a display screen adapted to cooperate with a 
pointing device. The method includes providing a 

database and a first index list. The method further 
includes displaying an array of objects on the display 

screen. The method also includes receiving a first set 
of signals relating to at least one object from the 

displayed array of objects; creating a first search 
string based on the first set of signals; displaying a 

plurality of entries of the first index list based on 
the value of the first search string; and receiving a 

signal relating to one of the displayed entries, the 
signal identifying an entry selected by the user. The 

method finally includes the step of displaying at least 
one object representing a phone number associated with 

the selected entry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a commonly owned 
application being filed concurrently with this 
application. The related application is identified by 
Attorney Docket Number USW 0120 PUS and is entitled 
"Computer Interface Method and System." This invention relates to methods and systems 
for processing and displaying information and, in 
particular, to methods and systems for processing and 
displaying information at a telephone station to permit 
a search of a database. Currently, products are available which permit 
a user of a computer to search an on-line telephone 
directory for the telephone number of a specific person 
or company. Some of these products incorporate a step-wise 
search technique. Typically, this technique 
requires the user to use a keyboard to type the letters 
of the name of the person or company whose telephone 
number is desired. As each successive letter is typed, 
the name matching the typed letters is displayed on the 
screen. While these products make it possible for the 
user to find the desired telephone number, they have  
 
significant disadvantages. First, the user is required 
to use a keyboard to define the search parameters. 
Users who are less adept with the layout of a keyboard 
will be less efficient than users who are more familiar 
with the layout of a keyboard. Second, the user is 
required to search only by name. If, for example, the 
user does not know the name of a company but knows other 
information such as the first digit of the phone number 
or the line of business of the company, locating the 
telephone number of the company using conventional 
methods would prove nearly impossible. A need therefore exists for a product which 
addresses the shortcomings of the products presently 
available. A need exists for a product which provides 
the user an alternative way to define the search 
parameters without requiring the use of a keyboard. 
Furthermore, a need exists for a method and system which 
allows the user to constrain the search other than by 
name alone. The present invention described and disclosed 
herein comprises a method and system for processing and 
displaying objects to permit a search of a database upon 
receiving input through a display device adapted to 
cooperate with a pointing device. An object of the present invention is to 
provide a method and system for processing and 
displaying objects to permit a search of a database 
using an intuitive user interface.  Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a method and system
