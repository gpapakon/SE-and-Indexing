<ABSTRACT>
A metering valve wherein an outer casing (48) 
defines a first (100a) and second (100b) chamber 

communicating with each other via a hole (105) and 
respectively communicating externally of the casing via 

a fluid inlet conduit (107) and a fluid recirculating 
conduit (108). The first chamber also communicates 

externally via a supply conduit (98), and houses a 
shutter (111) movable axially inside the chamber between 

a first position wherein a first portion (130) of the 
shutter closes the aforementioned hole (105), and a 

second position wherein a second portion (135) of the 
shutter closes the supply conduit (98). For any 

intermediate position between the first and second 
positions, the total area of the gaps between the supply 

conduit (98) and the second portion (135) and between 
the hole (105) and the first portion (130) is notably 

constant, so that, for any position of the shutter, the 
total section of the fluid passage of the metering valve 

is constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metering valve 
for automatic fluid metering devices, particularly for 
industrial ink and paint. Automatic fluid metering devices are known wherein 
a supporting structure presents a number of metering 
valves, each presenting a delivery way, a recirculating 
way, and a supply nozzle. Each valve is movable in relation to the 
supporting structure between a first idle position 
wherein the nozzle is closed and all the incoming fluid 
is recirculated, and an operating position wherein the 
valve is connected to a regulating device for so opening 
the valve as to feed part of the incoming fluid out 
through the nozzle. Gradual opening of the valve results in a 
variation in the total section of the fluid passage and 
hence in the hydraulic resistance of the valve, so that 
any variation in the supply pressure of the valve 
results in a sharp variation in supply by the nozzle  
 
even with no change in the section of the fluid passage. Moreover, gradual opening of the valve results in 
a sharp variation in pressure inside the valve itself. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a valve for automatic fluid metering devices, 
designed to overcome the drawbacks typically associated 
with known valves. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a valve as described in Claim 1. A preferred, non-limiting embodiment of the 
present invention will be described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1a shows an automatic fluid metering device 
featuring a metering valve in accordance with the 
teachings of the present invention; Figure 1b shows an automatic fluid metering device 
in a second operating configuration; Figure 1c shows an automatic fluid metering device 
in a third operating configuration; Figure 1d shows an automatic fluid metering device 
in a fourth operating configuration; Figure 2 shows a top plan view of the device in 
Figures 1a-1d; Figure 3 shows a partial side view of the Figure 2 
device; Figure 4 shows a section of a metering valve in 
accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Number 1 in Figures 1a-1d indicates an automatic  
 
fluid metering device, particularly for industrial ink 
and paint. Device 1 comprises a modular metal supporting 
structure 4 composed of a central structure 7 and at 
least one peripheral structure 10 fitted to central 
structure 7. More specifically, in Figures 1a, 1b, 1c 
and 1d, central structure 7 is shown connected 
respectively to one, two,

A metering valve for automatic fluid metering 
devices, particularly for industrial ink and paint, 

comprising: 

an outer casing (48) defining at least one 
chamber (100a) communicating externally via a fluid 

supply conduit (98) on the casing itself; 
said chamber (100a) also communicating 
externally via a fluid inlet conduit (107) on said 

casing (48); and 
said chamber (100a) also presenting at least one 
hole (105) communicating with a recirculating conduit 

(108); 
   characterized in that said metering valve 

comprises at least a shutter (111) movable axially along 
said chamber (100a) between a first position wherein a 

first portion (130) of said shutter mates with and
