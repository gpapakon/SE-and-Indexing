<ABSTRACT>
An environmentally compatible and biodegradable fabric conditioning composition is provided capable of providing improved softening with significant reduction and solubilization of unwanted mineral encrustations on fabrics to be softened. The composition comprises a fabric conditioning mixture of (a) at least one of (i) an alkanolamine diester having general formula (I) and (ii) an alkanolamine triester having general formula (II) wherein R1, R2 and R3 are each independently hydrogenated tallow or soft tallow; and n,m and p are integers from 1 to 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions which are suitable for softening in the rinse cycle of an automatic household washing machine, and which are especially adapted for use under European laundering conditions. More particularly, the present invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions comprising defined alkanolamine diester and/or triester combination with an acid and optionally a fatty alcohol, which compositions are characterized by superior environmental compatibility relative to conventional tertiary amine or quaternary ammonium fabric softening compositions concomitant with providing improved calcium salt solubilization and reduction of encrustation on treated fabrics. The combination of organic acid with cationic fabric softener such as amines and quaternary ammonium compounds is extensively disclosed in the prior art. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,904,359 and 3,954,630 to Ramachandran disclose a fabric treating composition comprising a complexing acid such as citric or maleic acid in combination with a quaternary ammonium compound or amines such as primary tallow and primary coco amine. The function of the acid, as stated in the patents, is to prevent yellowing of fabrics due to build-up of cationic softener and to provide a complexing site for metal ions contained in soils. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,828,722 to Steltenkamp and U.S. 4,869,836 to Harmalker disclose multicarboxylic acid complexes of tertiary amines formed from a tertiary amine and a carboxylic acid selected from among citric acid and di and tri carboxylic acids having 21 to 54 carbon atoms. In U.S. Patent 4,832,856 is disclosed a fabric softener composition comprising a combination of carboxylic acid and amines having a long chain alkyl or alkenyl radical.European Patent Publication No. 123,400 to Kardouch discloses detergent compositions containing salts of specified tertiary amines and carboxylic acids which are utilized in the form of modules that pass virtually unchanged through the wash and rinse and then condition the fabric when heated in a dryer. European Patent Publication No. 417,987 describes fabric softening compositions comprised of tertiary amines and carboxylic acids.Although satisfactory results may be obtained with one or more of these prior art fabric softening compositions, further improvements are needed in terms of being able to provide efficacious fabric softening with a biodegradable cationic fabric softening compound, concomitant with
