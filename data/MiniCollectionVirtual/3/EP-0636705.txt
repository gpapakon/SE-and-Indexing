<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent 
Application No.5-204703 filed on July 27, 1993, which is incorporated 
herein by reference. This invention relates to a vapor phase growth apparatus, and 
more precisely to a vertical type vapor phase growth apparatus 
used for the vapor phase growth of an epitaxial layer on a 
semiconductor substrate. In semiconductor manufacturing processes, the technique 
utilizing the vapor phase reaction to grow semiconductor 
epitaxial layers on a semiconductor substrate is very important. 
Recent years, in addition to group IV element semiconductors 
(including Si and Ge), group III-V compound semiconductors 
(including GaAs, InP, GaP, GaAsP, AlGaP, AlGaAs, InGaAs and 
InGaP) and group II-VI compound semiconductors (including ZnS,  
 
ZnSe, ZnSSe, CdTe and CdS) are used to grow semiconductor 
epitaxial layers. When conducting the vapor phase growth of epitaxial layers, 
horizontal type apparatus, vertical (or pancake) type apparatus, 
barrel (or cylindrical) type apparatus, etc., are used. Of 
these, the vertical type apparatus has the advantage of producing 
epitaxial growth layers with a uniform layer thickness. Figure 6 is a schematic cross section showing an example of 
a conventional vertical type vapor phase growth apparatus. In 
this vertical type vapor phase growth apparatus, a reaction 
chamber 12 is formed by placing a temple-bell-shape belljar 11 
on a base plate 10. In this reaction chamber 12, a horizontal 
disk-shaped susceptor 14 on which semiconductor substrates 13 are 
placed is provided, and high frequency heating coil(s) 15 are 
provided in a coil cover 16 on the lower surface of the susceptor 
14 to heat the semiconductor substrates 13 via the susceptor 14. At the center of the reaction chamber 12, a tube-shaped 
nozzle 17 to introduce source gas for the vapor phase growth 
stands vertically through the susceptor 14. The top of the 
nozzle 17 is sealed by a plate 18, a large number of blowout 
holes 17a are provided on the side surface of the nozzle 17 to 
blow out the source gas along the surface of the susceptor 14, 
and a blowout hole(s) 18a is also provided on the plate 18 at the 
top of the nozzle 17.  The source gas is fed through the gas inlet port 19, and the 
main portion of it is blown out through the blowout holes 17a 
provided on the side surface of the nozzle 17, directed parallel 
to the main surface of the semiconductor substrates 13 into the 
reaction chamber 12, and discharged through the gas exhaust 
port(s) 20. Since
