<ABSTRACT>
A digital information recording-reproducing 
apparatus is disclosed, in which a signal temporally 

compressed to 1/n and transmitted is encoded for 
recording by a recording encoder (40). The rotation 

speed of a rotary drum (50) is set at R₁, and the running 
speed of a magnetic tape (60) at V₁. The signal encoded 

is recorded on the magnetic tape (60) by magnetic heads 
(51a, 51b). At the time of reproduction, the rotary drum 

(50) is driven at a speed m/n times faster than for 
recording, and the magnetic tape (60) is run at a speed 

1/n times faster than for recording. The signal 
reproduced by the magnetic heads (51a, 51b) is decoded 

and restored into the original digital information signal 
by a reproducing decoder (70). As a result, there is 

provided a recording-reproducing apparatus having the 
function of time-base expansion with a reduced recording 

time applied to a system for transmitting and recording 
the software information of video or the like through 

radio wave or cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital
information recording-reproducing apparatus, or more in
particular to a digital information recording-reproducing
apparatus having a time-base restoration function.The Institute of Television Engineers of Japan
Journal Vol. 47, No. 4, April 1993, pp. 494-499,
describes a system conceived to transmit audio or video
software through radio wave or a cable to be recorded in
each home.In this conventional system, however, the rate
at which software information is transmitted, recorded
and reproduced is fixed. Especially, no measure is taken
to shorten the recording time.Also, the problem of the above-mentioned
conventional system is that the sale or rent which may be
made of audio or video software requires management of
information on customers, number of days rented, etc.One such system may be interactive, in which
the user requests the video software he wants from the
transmitting end, and the software supplier transmits the
desired software. In such a case, however, it takes a
predetermined length of time before the wanted digital 
information signal is actually transmitted from the time
the particular video software is requested. More
specifically, the transmitting end is required to prepare
the video data to be transmitted or to stand by until a
transmission channel becomes available. This leads to
the problem that the user cannot determine the time to
start his VTR.DE-A-38 40 290 discloses a method for recording and/or reproducing of data signals
being recorded with rotating magnetic heads on parallelly running oblique
tracks on magnetic tape and being taken from the magnetic tape, wherein the
feeding speed of the magnetic tape deviates from a standard feeding speed. In
case the feeding speed of the magnetic tape is reduced in comparison with a standard
feeding speed by a factor 1/n, the static angle of the track being formed by
the magnetic tape being twisted round the drum guiding the tape is changed such
that a course of the track of the rotating magnetic heads corresponds to the formats
of track previously determined.DE-A-36 13 230 relates to the magnetic recording and reproducing of video signals.
A control means for controlling the feeding speed of a magnetic tape and of
the speed of rotation of a rotating drum accommodating a video head is provided
for permitting the control of the feeding speed such that it deviates by a factor of
1/n from regular recording in forward direction and in backward direction, respectively.
Furthermore, a means for
