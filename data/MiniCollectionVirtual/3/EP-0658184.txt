<DESCRIPTION>
 LIQUID OR GEL DISHWASHING DETERGENT COMPOSITION CONTAINING ALKYL AMPHOCARBOXYLIC ACID-AND MAGNESIUM OR CALCIUM IONSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to liquid or gel dishwashing detergent compositions containing alkyl amphocarboxylic acid and magnesium or calcium ions.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONLiquid or gel dishwashing detergents with good grease removal benefits are much desired by consumers. Calcium and magnesium ions have been added to certain liquid or gel detergent compositions to improve grease cleaning benefits. However, it may be necessary to limit the pH and/or add chelating agents to stabilize these compositions. Ampholytic surfactants (amphoteric surfactants) in a dishwashing detergent composition provide mildness to the composition by mitigating the harshness of anionic surfactants. It has been found that magnesium or calcium ions when added to a liquid or gel detergent composition containing certain alkyl amphocarboxylic acids surprisingly improves the stability, grease cleaning and sudsing of the composition at mildly alkaline pH (i.e., pH 7-10).SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A liquid or gel dishwashing detergent composition comprising, by weight:(a) from about 5% to about 95% of an alkyl amphocarboxylic acid of the general formula:0RC-NHCH2CH2Ri wherei n R i s a Cβ-Cis al kyl group , and Ri i s of the general formul a : 

 (CH2)χC00- (CH2)XC00-/ - /N or N(+) -CH2CH2θH\ \5 RI R1 wherein R1 is a (CH2)XC00M or CH2CH2OH, and x is 1 or 2 and M is a cation;(b) from about 0.1% to about 4% of magnesium or calcium ions; and 0 (c) from about 40% to about 55% water; wherein a 10% said composition has a pH in a 10% solution in water at 20°C of between from about 7 and about 10.A particularly preferred embodiment also comprises from about5% to about 95% of a co-surfactant selected from the group 15 consisting of anionic surfactant, nonionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, ampholytic surfactant, zwitterionic surfactant and mixtures thereof, and less than about 10% of suds booster.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 0 The liquid or gel, preferably liquid, dishwashing detergent compositions of the present invention contain an alkyl amphocarboxylic acid, preferably an alkyl amphodicarboxylic acid, and a source of magnesium or calcium, preferably magnesium, ions. The compositions herein may also contain a co-surfactant, 5 preferably anionic surfactant, and suds booster. These and other complementary optional ingredients typically found in liquid or gel dishwashing compositions are set forth
