<ABSTRACT>
An anti-theft device (10) mountable on, in or otherwise 
adjacent the battery (12) of a motor vehicle includes an enclosed 

power switch (64) for opening the starting circuit between the 
battery (12) and starter motor (54) when the anti-theft device (10) is 

activated, whereby it is impossible to start the vehicle. A 
normally closed bimetal switch device (78) is connected in parallel 

with the power switch (64) in one embodiment and is connected to 
the vehicle battery (12) through the ignition switch (58) whereby, when 

the power switch (64) is open, an effort to start the vehicle 
through the ignition switch (58) or by shortening the latter 

results in a noise which simulates a weak battery. A 
resistance (134) is also connected across the power switch (64) in 

parallel therewith to preclude the dropout of pre-set 
electrical accessories in the vehicle when the power switch (64) is 

open. The anti-theft device is preferably operably by a 
remotely controlled encoder (82) having a code signal identified by 

circuitry (80) controlling operation of the power switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of anti-theft devices
for motor vehicles and, more particularly, to an improved
self-contained anti-theft device which can be provided in,
directly attached to or otherwise mounted adjacent the battery
of a motor vehicle.The present invention provides improvements in connection
with self-contained anti-theft devices of the character
disclosed in patents US-A-4,553,127 to Francis Issa and US-A-5,132,551
to Louis D. Carlo et al, which patents are owned by the assignee
of the present invention, and the disclosures of
which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.Each of the foregoing patents discloses a self-contained
anti-theft device adapted to be mounted in or on a
vehicle battery and which is operable to preclude starting
of the vehicle engine when the anti-theft device is activated
such as through the use of a remotely controlled encoder.
More particularly, the anti-theft device comprises a power
switch shiftable between first and second conditions respectively
operatively connecting and disconnecting the battery
to the starting circuit of the vehicle which includes a
starting motor and an ignition switch. In both patents,
when the anti-theft device is activated, the power switch is
automatically shifted into the second condition in response
to flow of a substantial amount of current from the battery
indicative of an attempt to start the vehicle through use of
the ignition switch or shorting thereof. In connection with
such an attempt to start the vehicle, the power switch opens
for a given short period of time and then closes, and repeats
such opening and closing so long as the ignition
switch is actuated or the short thereacross continues. Such
opening and closing of the power switch precludes the 
delivery of sufficient current to the starting motor.
This advantageously deters a
would-be thief from further tampering with the vehicle in an
effort to steal the same by driving it from its parked location.
Through the use of the remotely controlled encoder,
the power switch shifting arrangement can be disabled for a
predetermined period of time, whereby the power switch will
remain closed in response to actuation of the ignition
switch to allow starting of the vehicle. Once started, the
anti-theft device will remain in the first condition, whereby
the power switch will remain closed during operation of
the vehicle. In the event of a stall, the shifting arrangement
is again disabled for a predetermined time so as to
allow the vehicle operator to restart the vehicle
