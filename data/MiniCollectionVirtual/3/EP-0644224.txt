<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a process for granulating a 
highly water-absorptive resin, comprising the steps of: 

placing 100 parts by weight of a highly water-absorptive 
resin having a crosslinked structure comprising as its 

constituent a carboxyl group and/or a carboxylate group 
in a low-speed rotary paddle mixer; dropwise adding and 

mixing 0.05 to 10 parts by weight of a water-soluble or 
water-dispersible polymer compound, in the form of an 

aqueous solution or a water dispersion containing water 
in such an amount as to bring the water content of the 

resin to 30 to 70%, with the resin in the presence of 0.1 
to 10 parts by weight of a fine powder of an insoluble 

inorganic material by means of the mixer; and drying the 
mixture in a tumbling drier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for granulating 
a highly water-absorptive resin. More particularly, this 
invention relates to a process for granulating a highly 
water-absorptive resin, which enables the production of 
resin granules having an appropriate granule size and a 
narrow granule size distribution in a high yield. Highly water-absorptive resins have hitherto been 
used in various applications including paper diapers, 
sanitary goods, disposable cleaning cloth and other goods 
in sanitary fields, water retentive materials, soil 
conditioners and other materials in agricultural fields, 
sludge coagulants, dew condensation preventive materials 
for building materials and dehydrating agents for oils. 
Various highly water-absorptive resins are known in the 
art, and examples thereof include those comprising a 
crosslinked polyacrylic acid salt, a crosslinked graft 
copolymer of starch and an acrylic acid salt, a 
saponified product of a crosslinked graft copolymer of 
starch and acrylonitrile and a saponified product of a 
crosslinked copolymer of an acrylic ester and vinyl 
acetate. These highly water-absorptive resins generally 
contain a considerable amount of a fine powder having a 
particle size of not more than 100 mesh. This raises the 
following problems upon handling of the resins. 
(1) Dust occurs which worsens working environment. (2) The fluidity is so low that the phenomena of 
bridging and clogging often occur. (3) Upon contact with a liquid, the resin is likely 
to form a lump. Various methods for solving these problems have been 
proposed in the art, and examples thereof include a 
method in which the fine powder is removed, a method in  
 
which granulation of a resin is carried out by using an 
agglomerating agent, such as an organic binder, in 
combination with water or using an aqueous solution 
containing an agglomerating agent, such as an organic 
binder (see Publication of the Translation of 
International Patent Application No. 501492/1991 and 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 308820/1990 and 
137129/1991) and a method in which an inorganic powder is 
added to a resin in the presence of a surfactant to carry 
out granulation of the resin (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Nos. 132936/1987 and 28492/1990 and Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 26204/1991). However, the removal of fine powder requires a 
separator and the separated fine powder should be 
disposed of, which is disadvantageous from the viewpoint 
of economy. On the other hand, the granulation of a resin by the
