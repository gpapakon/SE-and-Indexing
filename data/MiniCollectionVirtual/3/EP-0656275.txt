<ABSTRACT>
A traction control system for a vehicle reduces 
the rate of slip of driving wheels (IRR,IRL) of the vehicle by 

reducing the traction force transmitted to the road 
surface from the driving wheels (IRR,IRL) when the driving wheels 

(IRR,IRL) slip. Whether the vehicle is making a turn is judged, 
and whether the vehicle is in an instable state which 

occurs when the vehicle is making a turn. The traction 
force is reduced by a higher rate when the driving wheels (IRR,IRL) 

slip while the vehicle is making a turn than when the 
driving wheels (IRR,IRL) slip while the vehicle is running 

straight, and the traction force is reduced by a higher 
rate when the driving wheels (IRR,IRL) slip while the vehicle is in 

an instable state than when the driving wheels (IRR,IRL) slip while 
the vehicle is making a turn.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a traction control
system for a vehicle which reduces the torque transmitted
to the road surface from the driving wheels of the
vehicle in order to suppress slip of the driving wheels.There has been known a traction control system
for a vehicle which reduces the torque transmitted to the
road surface from the driving wheels of the vehicle in
order to suppress slip of the driving wheels.In the traction control system, the rate of slip
of the driving wheels is detected and the traction force
(torque transmitted to the road surface from the driving
wheels) is reduced by lowering the engine output and/or
applying brakes to the driving wheels so that the rate of
slip of the driving wheels converges on a target rate of
slip which is determined according to the friction
coefficient of the road surface, thereby preventing
deterioration in the starting performance or accelerating
performance due to slip of the driving wheels caused by
an excessive driving torque during starting or
acceleration.When the driving wheels slip during turning, it
becomes difficult for the vehicle to make a stable turn.
Especially it becomes more difficult for the vehicle to
make a stable turn when the vehicle comes into an 
oversteering state in the case of a rear-drive vehicle
and into an understeering state in the case of front-drive
vehicle.Thus there has been proposed a traction control
system in which when a rear-drive vehicle is in an
oversteering state, the target rate of slip is reduced so
that the traction control is initiated earlier, thereby
ensuring stability during a turn. See, for instance,
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3(1991)-157255.However, conventionally, whether the vehicle is
in an instable state during turning, e.g., in an
oversteering state (in the case of a rear-drive vehicle)
or in an understeering state (in the case of a front-drive
vehicle) cannot be constantly detected precisely
and accordingly, when it is misjudged that the vehicle is
in an instable state and the traction control is
initiated earlier in spite of the fact that the vehicle
is actually in a stable state, the engine output is
unnecessarily lowered or the braking force is
unnecessarily increased.For example, in one known method of judging
whether the vehicle is in an oversteering state, it is
judged that the vehicle is in an oversteering state when
the difference between the actual yaw rate of the vehicle
and a reference yaw rate (a yaw rate which is to act on
the vehicle on the basis of the vehicle speed,
