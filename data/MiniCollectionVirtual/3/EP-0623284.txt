<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of nematophagous fungi to controll plant 
parasitic nematodes and nematicidal compositions, containing fungi which form 

a sticky mycelium having undifferentiated hyphae which are able to attach to 
the nematodes. The invention further relates to a process for protecting plants 

against the action of plant parasitic nematodes, which comprises treating the 
plants, parts of the plants/or the soil with nematophagous fungi having 

undifferentiated hyphae which are able to attach to the nematodes. In an 
preferred embodiment the fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora (CBS 289.82) is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
Species of the Dactylaria-complex are able to capture vermiform nematodes 
with trapping devices (Stirling, 1991). The infection process generally can be 
distinguished in different stages: attraction and capture (attachment), 
penetration, subsequent toxification/ inactivation and digestion of the 
nematodes of the fungus. Most in vitro studies on the successive events of the infection process were 
performed on a model system with Panagrellus redivivus, a bacteriophagous 
nematode, and an isolate of Arthrobotrys oligospora as the fungus (Tunlid et al., 
1972). On capture and infection of plant-parasitic nematodes few reports are 
presented and little is known about the physiological and biochemical processes 
of the fungus-nematode interaction (Den Belder, 1991). Several nematode-capturing fungi seem to be highly specific in attraction, 
capture and infection of particular nematode species (Jansson & Nordbring-Hertz; 
1980; Boag et al., 1988; Esser et al., 1991). Other parasites of 
nematodes such as the bacterium Pasteuria penetrans have shown specificity in 
attachment to different populations of the same nematode species e.g. 
Meloidogyne spp. Thus results obtained with other than plant-parasitic 
nematodes may have a limited value in predicting capture ability of the latter. Depending on their relative saprophytic/predacious abilities nematophagous 
fungi have been divided into three ecological groups (Jansson and Nordbring-Hertz, 
1980). Group 1, considered as the most saprophytic, constitutes the 
adhesive network formers. The nematode trapping rings structures are formed 
as a result of contact with nematodes. The fungi show good saprophytic  
 
growth on artificial media and are only weakly predatory. Group 2 constitutes fungi producing other types of traps: (non-)constricting 
rings, adhesive knobs and adhesive branches. Trap formation is usually 
spontaneous in the absence of nematodes. These fungi show a higher 
predacious ability and weaker saprophytic ability than the group of the adhesive 
network formers. Group 3 constitutes the endoparasitic fungi, which do not form any mycelium in 
soil. They persist in the soil as conidia or exist as zoospores. Most of these 
fungi are obligate nematode parasites. Monacorsporium cionopagum (CBS 228.52) is a constricting ring former, 
Arthrobotrys dactyloides (CBS 109.37) as well as Arthrobotrys conoides (CBS 
265.83), Arthrobotrys oligospora (CBS 289.82, CBS 115.81 and ATCC 
24927), Arthrobotrys scaphoides (CBS 226.52) and Duddingtonia flagrans 
(CBS
