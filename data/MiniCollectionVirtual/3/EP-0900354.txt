<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a method of detonator control with electronic ignition module (15). Each module (15) is associated with specific parameters comprising at least one identification parameter and one explosion delay time, and comprises a firing capacitance and a rudimentary internal clock. The modules (15) are capable of communicating with a blast control unit (17) equipped with a reference time base. The method comprises the following steps: storing the identification parameters in the module with a programming unit (18); effecting for each successive module and the blast controlling unit a calibration of its internal clock, and sending the associated delay time to the module; sending a firing capacitance charging command to the modules; sending the modules a firing commande via the blast control unit, triggering possible reinitialization of the internal clocks and a blast sequence.
