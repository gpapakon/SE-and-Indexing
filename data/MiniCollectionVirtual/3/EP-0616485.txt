<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic driver (10) comprises an acoustically 
transparent first electrode (12) an acoustically 

transparent second electrode (14) spaced apart from the 
first electrode (12) to define a space between the 

first and the second electrodes (12 and 14). A charged 
diaphragm (18) is suspended in the space between the 

first and the second electrodes (12 and 14). The first 
and the second electrodes (12 and 14) are partially 

insulated to generate A.C. and D.C. electric fields 
dissimilar in strength and form in the said space in 

which the diaphragm (18) is suspended to optimize the 
forces moving the diaphragm (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to wave propagating and receiving 
systems. Particularly, this invention relates to 
electrostatic drivers, particularly for loud 
speaker, earphones and microphone systems. Electrostatic drivers in loud speaker and microphone systems 
are well known. In electrostatic driver, an electric field 
reflecting the wave form of the input voltage moves a charged 
diaphragm thus creating waves, typically, sound waves. One 
type of electrostatic driver in the prior art uses 
acoustically transparent electrodes, which are connected in 
such a way that the electrostatic field for direct current 
and alternating current voltages applied to the electrode is 
the same in shape, form and intensity. This limits the field 
strength and output of the electrostatic driver. Another 
disadvantage is that the conventional electrostatic drivers 
are restricted in the sense that by increasing the applied 
voltage, there is a greater tendency for arcing.  In view of the foregoing, it is the aim of the invention to 
achieve the following objects, either alone or in 
combination:
 
   to provide an electrostatic driver upon which a higher 
voltage and the resultant higher field strength can be 
applied without arcing;
 
   to provide an electrostatic driver in which the 
tendency for arcing when the applied voltage is 
increased is substantially reduced;
 
   to provide novel electrodes for electrostatic driver 
which are capable of generating dissimilar Ac and DC 
electric fields; and
 
   to provide a novel diaphragm for an electrostatic 
driver with improved characteristics.  According to the first aspect of this invention, there is 
provided an electrostatic driver which comprises
 
   an acoustically transparent first electrode;
 
   an acoustically transparent second electrode spaced 
apart from the first electrode to define a space 
between the first and the second electrodes; and
 
   a charged diaphragm suspended in the space between the 
first and the second electrodes; characterised in that 
the first and the second electrodes are partially 
insulated to generate A.C. and D.C. electric fields 
dissimilar in strength and form in the said space in 
which the diaphragm is suspended to optimize the forces 
moving the diaphragm. The first and second electrodes may be acoustically 
transparent grills or perforated plates, and may be straight 
or arcuate. The diaphragm may be suspended in the space between the first 
and the second electrodes by means of a plurality of 
insulating elongate elements, the

An electrostatic driver which comprises 
an acoustically transparent first electrode; 

an acoustically transparent second electrode spaced 
apart from the first electrode to define a space 

between the first and the second electrodes; and 
a charged diaphragm suspended in the space between the 

first and the second electrodes; characterised in that 
the first and the second electrodes are partially 

insulated to generate A.C. and D.C. electric fields 
dissimilar in strength and form in the said space in 

which the diaphragm is suspended to optimize the forces 
moving the diaphragm. 
An electrostatic driver as claimed in Claim 1, in which 
the first and second electrodes are acoustically 

transparent grills. 
An electrostatic driver as claimed in Claim 1, in which 
the first and second electrodes are acoustically 

perforated plates. 
An electrostatic driver as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, in which the first and second 

electrodes and the diaphragm are flat planar elements. 
An electrostatic driver as claimed in any one of Claims 
1 to 3, in which the first and second electrodes and 

the diaphragm are arcuate. 
An electrostatic driver as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, in which the diaphragm is suspended 

in the space between the first and the second 
electrodes by means of a plurality of insulating 

elongate elements, the insulating elongate elements 
being stretched on the surface of either or both of the 

first or the second electrode, and providing precise 
spacing means between the diaphragm and the inner 

surface of the electrodes. 
An electrostatic driver as claimed in Claim 1, in which 
the diaphragm is suspended in the space between the 

first and the second electrodes by means of a plurality 
of spaced apart insulating strings which provide 

retaining means for holding and centering the diaphragm 
between the first and the second electrodes. 
An electrostatic driver as claimed in Claim 7, in which 
the insulating strings create separate sections of 

diaphragm forming separate driver units, each of which 
is capable of radiating waves in a slightly different 

angle and the separate driver units, forming 
collectively, a substantially improved radiating 

surface. 
An electrostatic driver as claimed in Claim 1, in which 
the diaphragm is a double film diaphragm coated with 

high or low resistance material. 
An electrostatic driver as described herein 
substantially with reference to the accompanying 

drawings.
