<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle roll control system (22,24) for a 
vehicle (10) having a pair of wheels (12,16) each 

rotatable on an axle (14,18), comprising a torsion bar 
(26); a first arm (28) extending substantially 

perpendicular to the torsion bar, the first arm being 
fixed to the torsion bar at one end and being 

connectable to one of the axles at the other end; a 
second arm (30) extending substantially perpendicular 

to the torsion bar, the second arm being rotatably 
mounted on the torsion bar at one end and being 

connectable to the other axle at the other end; and 
rotation control means (32,34) connected between the 

second arm and the torsion bar, the rotation control 
means being actuable on detection of a predetermined 

vehicle condition to substantially prevent or allow 
rotation of the second arm relative to the torsion 

bar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roll 
control system for a motor vehicle. GB-A-2,230,237 discloses a roll control 
system comprising a torsion bar, a first arm fixedly 
connected to one end of the torsion bar, and a second 
arm rotatably connected to the other end of the 
torsion bar by way of a rotary actuator. The rotary 
actuator is operable to effect relative angular 
movement between the second arm and the said other end 
of the torsion bar. This arrangement is such that the 
actuator has to generate a large amount of force in 
order to provide the required roll control. The aim of the present invention is to 
provide a roll control system which overcomes the 
above mentioned disadvantage. FR-A-1254827 discloses a vehicle roll 
control system in accordance with the preamble of 
claim 1. A vehicle roll control system in accordance 
with the present invention is characterised over 
FR-A-1254827 by the features specified in the 
characterising portion of claim 1. The present invention will now be described 
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:-  
 
Figure 1 is a schematic presentation of a 
vehicle incorporating a vehicle roll control system in 
accordance with the present invention at the front and 
at the rear of the vehicle; Figure 2 is a side view of the vehicle roll 
control system at the front of the vehicle shown in 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a side view of the first arm of 
the vehicle roll control system shown in Figure 2; Figure 4 is a side view of the second arm, 
hydraulic actuator (shown in cross-section) and lever 
arm of the vehicle roll control system shown in Figure 
2; Figure 5 is a schematic diagram of part of 
the hydraulic and electrical control circuit of the 
vehicle roll control system shown in Figure 2; and Figure 6 is a schematic diagram of a 
variation of the hydraulic control circuit shown in 
Figure 5. Referring to Figure 1, a vehicle 10 is shown 
schematically and comprises a pair of front wheels 12 
each rotatably mounted on an axle 14, a pair of rear 
wheels 16 each rotatably mounted on an axle 18, and a 
shocking absorbing system 20 associated with each 
wheel. A vehicle roll control system 22 in accordance 
with the present invention is associated with the 
front wheels 12, and a vehicle roll control system 24 
in accordance with the present invention is associated 
with the rear wheels 16. The vehicle roll control 
systems 22, 24 are substantially the same but with 
modifications made solely to allow fitting to the 
vehicle 10.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle roll control system for a 
vehicle (10) having a pair of wheels (12,16) each 

rotatable on an axle (14,18), comprising a torsion bar 
(26); a first arm (28) extending substantially 

perpendicular to the torsion bar, the first arm being 
fixed to the torsion bar at one end (38) and being 

connectable to one of the axles at the other end (42); 
a second arm (30) extending substantially 

perpendicular to the torsion bar, the second arm being 
rotatably mounted on the torsion bar at one end (44) 

and being connectable to the other axle at the other 
end (48); and rotation control means (32,34,68) 

connected to the torsion bar and to the second arm 
between its ends, the rotation control means being 

actuable on detection of a predetermined vehicle 
condition to either substantially prevent or allow 

rotation of the second arm relative to the torsion 
bar; wherein the rotation control means comprises a 

lever arm (32) extending substantially perpendicular 
to the torsion bar (26), the lever arm being fixed to 

the torsion bar at one end (50) adjacent said one end 
(44) of the second arm (30), and having a free end 

(54) at the other end thereof; a hydraulic actuator 
(34) extending between the second arm and the lever 

arm, and comprising a housing (56) connected to either 
the second arm or the free end of the lever arm and 

defining a pair of fluid chambers (58,60) separated by 
a piston (62) connected to the other of the second arm 

or the free end of the lever arm; and a valve (68) 
controlling flow of fluid between the two fluid 

chambers, the valve being closable on detection of the 
predetermined condition to prevent flow of fluid, 

thereby substantially locking the piston relative to 
the housing to substantially prevent rotation of the  

 
second arm relative to the torsion bar; characterised 

in that the fluid chambers (58,60) are connected to a 
fluid reservoir (80) by the valve (68) when the valve 

is open, the fluid reservoir having a piston (87) 
defining a closed fluid chamber (86), the fluid 

pressure in the closed fluid chamber defining the load 
acting on the second arm (30).  

 
A vehicle roll control system as claimed 
in claim 1, further comprising a hydraulic 

accumulator (90) fluidly connected to the fluid 
chambers (58,60) of the hydraulic actuator (34) and to 

the fluid reservoir (80) to substantially prevent 
damage to the hydraulic actuator or the valve (68) or 

the fluid reservoir. 
A vehicle roll control system as claimed 
in claims 1 or claim 2, wherein the valve (68) is 

operated by an electronic control module (70) which 
receives signals dependent on the predetermined 

vehicle condition. 
A vehicle roll control system as claimed 
in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the predetermined 

vehicle condition is a predetermined steering angle of 
the pair of wheels (12,16) and/or a predetermined 

sideways acceleration of the vehicle (10).
