<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a lithographic base comprising on a 
hydrophobic support a subbing layer contiguous to a hydrophilic 

layer containing a hydrophilic (co)polymer or (co)polymer mixture 
and being hardened with a hydrolysed tetraalkyl orthosilicate 

crosslinking agent characterized in that said subbing layer contains 
a hydrophilic binder and silica in a weight ratio less than 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithographic base. More
particularly the present invention relates to an improved adhesion
of the hydrophilic lithographic surface layer to the support of the
lithographic base.Lithography is the process of printing from specially prepared
surfaces, some areas of which are capable of accepting lithographic
ink, whereas other areas, when moistened with water, will not accept
the ink. The areas which accept ink form the printing image areas,
generally hydrophobic areas, and the ink-rejecting areas form the
background areas, generally hydrophilic areas.In the art of photolithography, a photographic material is made
imagewise receptive to oily or greasy inks in the photo-exposed
(negative-working) or in the non-exposed areas (positive-working) on
a hydrophilic background.In the production of common lithographic printing plates, also
called surface litho plates or planographic printing plates, a
lithographic base that has affinity to water or obtains such
affinity by chemical treatment is coated with a thin layer of a
photosensitive composition. Compositions for that purpose include
light-sensitive materials such as light-sensitive polymers,
diazonium salts or resins, a photoconductive layer, a silver halide
emulsion etc. These materials are then image-wise exposed to actinic
radiation and processed in the appropriate manner so as to obtain a
lithographic printing plate.In another embodiment, a silver precipitating (nucleating) agent
is located in or on top of the hydrophylic surface. An image is
obtained on the precipitating layer according to the silver salt
diffusion transfer process by contacting said precipitating layer
with an exposed silver halide emulsion in the presence of a silver
halide developing agent and a silver halide solvent.Several types of supports can be used for the manufacturing of a
lithographic imaging printing plate. Common supports are for
example organic resin supports, e.g.polyesters,and paper bases, e.g. 
polyolefin coated paper. These supports, if not sufficient
hydrophilic by themselves, are first coated with a hydrophilic layer
forming the hydrophilic lithographic background of the printing
plate.It is known to use as hydrophilic layer in these systems a layer
containing polyvinyl alcohol and hydrolyzed tetra(m)ethyl
orthosilicate and preferably also silicium dioxide and/or titanium
dioxide as described in e.g. GB-P-1419512, FR-P-2300354,
US-P-3971660 and 4284705, EP-A-405016 and 450199 and U.S.
