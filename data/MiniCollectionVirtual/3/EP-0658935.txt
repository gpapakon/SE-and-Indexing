<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin sealing type semiconductor device having a heat radiator
and a method of making such a semiconductor device.In recent years, Integrated Circuit chips are produced in larger scales, and the output is
increased. With this trend the heat radiation in the resin sealing needs to be improved for
inherently protecting semiconductor chips. To meet such an end, attempts have been made to
increase the thermal conductivity of lead frame and sealing resin in the light of material, and in
light of the structure to improve the heat radiating characteristic by changing the design of lead
frame and/or adding a heat radiator. Particularly, the improvement of the heat radiating
characteristic by adding a heat radiator is the most orthodox measure for LSIs in which the
power consumption is no more than about 2 watts per chip.A semiconductor element requiring an increased heat radiating characteristic is normally larger in
size. In the conventional resin sealing type semiconductor devices, thus, it may result in cracking
the element or damaging the electrical connection from a difference in thermal expansion
coefficient between the element and the sealing resin. Therefore, the reliability of the element is
insufficient.Further, in the conventional resin sealing type semiconductor devices, the process of injection
molding the resin tends to deform the lead or bonding wire from the pressure of injected resin,
and causes a failure in electrical connection.Conventional devices comprising
two heat radiating members are known from JP-A-5160304
and JP-A-4158558.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a resin sealing type semiconductor
device having an increased heat radiating characteristic, and a method of making the same.A further object of the present invention is to provide a resin sealing type semiconductor device
which can prevent the semiconductor element or its bonding wires from being damaged from a
difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the semiconductor element and the sealing
resin and which has a high reliability, and a method of making the same. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a resin sealing type semiconductor
device which can prevent its bonding wires from being deformed from the pressure of injected
resin on molding and which can stabilize the quality of products and reduces the defects in
products, and a method of making the same.These objects are achieved with a resin sealing type semiconductor device as
