<ABSTRACT>
In a portable telephone apparatus selectively operable in a portable or in an 
on-board mode, an option circuit (48) is built in a chargeable battery pack (34) for 

adding an extra function to a telephone (32). A plurality of keys are arranged on the 
telephone and operable to cause the telephone and option circuit to interchange speech 

signals and control signals and to start and stop operating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable telephone 
apparatus selectively operable in a portable mode or in an on-board 
mode and having option circuits built in a chargeable 
battery pack for adding extra functions to the telephone. It is a common practice with a portable telephone 
apparatus to add extra functions to a telephone by connecting 
or mounting an optional unit to or on the telephone. The 
optional unit has an extra function processing section for 
dealing with extra functions including a DTMF 
transmission/reception function. After the optional unit and 
the telephone have been connected by an exclusive multicore 
connector cable via respective interface connectors, a key or 
keys provided on the telephone are operated to activate the 
extra functions. In another conventional arrangement, 
connectors are mounted on the surface of a circuit board and 
connected to circuitry incorporated in the telephone. In this 
case, the optional circuits are implemented by a circuit board 
and mounted on the connector of the telephone for adding the  
 
DTMF transmission/reception function and other extra 
functions. The cable connection scheme is taught in, for example, 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3-109829 entitled 
"On-Board Adapter System for Portable Telephone". In this 
system, when a portable telephone is mounted on an on-board 
adapter, a battery thereof is charged. After information 
particular to the telephone has been transferred from the 
telephone to the on-board adapter, the telephone is usable in 
an on-board mode. This kind of scheme reduces the number of 
designing steps and the overall size of the system. However, 
the problem is that connecting the telephone and the optional 
unit by an exclusive connector cable complicates the 
construction and, moreover, leaves the telephone and the 
optional unit physically separate from each other. As a 
result, the whole apparatus is scaled up and is troublesome to 
operate when used as a portable telephone. On the other hand, the built-in option circuit scheme is 
not practicable without resorting to the circuits and 
connectors for connecting the option circuits when the 
telephone begins to be used or being used. Therefore, the 
telephone has to be provided with even the circuits and 
connectors for option circuits which are not always essential. 
This scales up the apparatus and signal processing and 
increases the cost. With the system disclosed in Japanese  
 
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3-109829, it is impossible 
to
