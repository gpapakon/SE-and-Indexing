<ABSTRACT>
A system for controlling drainage of the female bladder comprising a valved catheter (10), a stylet for placing the catheter in the female urethra (30), and a spike (60) for opening the valve (24) in the catheter to allow voiding of the contents of the bladder. The system also includes a sizing device (50) for determining the length of the urethra so that the proper fitting catheter is used. The catheter (10) comprises a hollow shaft (12) with an extendable sealing portion (18) on one end for placement through the urethra and a crown (18) on the other end for placement external of the body. The valve (24, 90) may be integral with the shaft or insertable after the catheter is placed in the urethra.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device to control
urination in an incontinent female.A wide spread medical problem suffered by at least
11 million American adults, particularly women is
incontinence. Many more suffer from the problem but,
because of embarrassment or because the problem is only
intermittent, don't disclose their lack of bladder
control. There are numerous causes including pregnancy,
stress, as well as the normal aging process.There presently are no adequate non-surgical
techniques for treating this problem. Catheters with an
attached bag are uncomfortable and are known to lead to
urinary infection. Pads may be effective for small
urinary leakage, such as occurs under stress, but are not
suitable for large volumes of urine evacuated from a full
bladder. Additionally, the use of pads requires the user
to carry a large supply of replacement pads. Urethral
plugs are unacceptable replacements because the user
frequently will soil her hands trying to remove the
device, reinsertion of the non sterile device may lead to
a bladder infection and the frequent insertion of the
plug, possibly a dozen times a day, can damage the
urethra and may cause bladder spasms. Plugs may also be
dangerous because they totally obstruct the ureter and
may result in excessive retention of urine.Published European Patent Application 0 444 831
discloses a female incontinence control device
(corresponding to the preamble of claim 1)
which
includes a tubular shaft approximately the length of the 
practised by the woman using devices which are safe to
use, discrete, and reliable, so that the woman can
participate in a normal lifestyle without fear of
embarrassing herself by accidentally voiding the contents
of her bladder or constantly running to the bathroom to
change pads.The present invention is directed to a device that
supplies these needs and eliminates the deficiencies of
prior devices and systems.The device of the invention comprises a valved
drainage catheter for temporary placement in the female
urethra. Additionally, the system also includes a sizing
device for selecting the proper length catheter, a
placement device to assure that the catheter is properly
positioned and instruments to aid in opening the valve in
the catheter.According to one aspect of the present invention
therefore, there is provided a valved urinary drainage
catheter for placement in the female urethra, the urethra
having an exterior opening at the point of exit from the
body and an interior opening at the point of entry into
the urinary
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>

b) a lower surface (14) resting against the
interior end of the urethra,
and the lumen (22) extends through the cap (16) and
ends at an opening (32) in the exterior surface of the

cap (16), characterised in that the sealing portion (18)
has an upper surface with openings (20) therein so that

fluid in the bladder can enter the shaft (12), and no
portion of the urinary drainage catheter extends exterior

of the urethra past the cap.
The urinary drainage catheter of claim 1
further including a valve (24) within the lumen (22) to

control flow of fluid through the catheter (10).
A urinary drainage control system comprising a 
valved urinary drainage catheter (10) for placement in

opening (32) at the point of exit from the body and an

interior opening at the point of entry into the urinary
bladder, a stylet (30) for use in placing the catheter

(10), and a hollow spike (60) for opening the valve (24)
to allow drainage of fluid from the bladder,

   the catheter (10) comprising a hollow shaft (12)

is in contact with the cap (16) the valve (24) opens

allowing fluid to drain from the bladder through the
shaft (12), valve (24) and the lumen (68) of the spike

(60) without soiling the fingers of the user.
