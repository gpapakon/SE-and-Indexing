<ABSTRACT>
A one piece garment constructed for use in a health care environment and the like. The garment includes a major portion (12) positionable over the head of the wearer, the major piece (12) having a forward edge (16) positionable across the forehead of the wearer and rearward edge (18) positionable across the back of the head of the wearer. The garment also includes a minor portion (22) positionable over the face of the wearer, the minor piece (22) having an upper egde (24) positionable beneath the eyes and above the nose of the wearer and a lower edge (26) positionable across the throat of the wearer. The major and minor portions are joined to form ear openings (32) therebetween and to also form a neck opening (34) between the rearward edge of the major portion (18) and the lower edge of the minor portion (26), and to also form an eye opening (36) between the forward edge of the major portion (16) and the upper edge of the minor portion (24).

 SURGICAL CAP AND MASKBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Summary of the InventionThis invention relates to a surgical cap and mask and, more particularly, to a one piece garment constructed for use in a health care environment and the like, the garment including a major portion positionable over the head of the wearer and a minor portion positionable over the face of the wearer, the major and minor portions being joined to form ear openings therebetween and to also form a neck opening and an eye opening. Description of the Background ArtThere is an ever continuing need for increased cleanliness and sterility in and around health care facilities. It has long been the practice for the physicians, nurses and other people at health care facilities to wear sterilized apparel either directly or over the normal apparel. Such sterilized apparel provides protection against the transmission (giving or receiving) of germs, viruses or the like.For many years, cloth garments have been utilized and then washed after each use in an effort to facilitate such protection. It has been found in recent years, however, that sterilized paper or other material, disposable and biodegradable is better suited for these purposes, both from a health stand point as well as from an economic standpoint. Such disposable products are readily sealed hermetically after fabrication and opened immediately prior to use, preferably in a sterilized room, for maximizing the safety to patient as well as physicians, nurses and other health care people. 

 Various garments have been designed, commercialized, and utilized and patented for covering the majority of the head and/or face of the health care people. Such garments frequently utilized a cap for covering the hair and adjacent head areas in combination with a mask which is tied around the back of the wearer's head to filter the breathing of the wearer. Unfortunately, time and effort is needed in putting on and taking off such garments. Various other devices have also been made in a one-piece configuration covering various parts of the anatomy. Prior to applicant's invention hereof, none has ever been constructed to maximize the safety and comfort while minimizing cost and inconvenience.In the ever increasing effort to improve head coverings for health care facilities, a wide variety of designs have been generated and a large number of patents have been issued. By way of example, consider U.S. Patent Numbers 911,433 to Pachner and 3,307,202 to Schuessler. Neither of these garments is constructed and

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A one piece cap and mask combination garment constructed for use in a health care environment, the garment including: a major piece of biodegradable material, the major piece being positionable over the head of the wearer, the major piece having a convex forward edge positionable across the forehead of the wearer and a convex rearward edge positionable across the back of the head of the wearer, the major piece also having similarly shaped essentially parallel side edges coupling the forward and rearward edges to form a generally square configuration, each side edge including parallel linear sections with a centrally disposed concave section positionable over an ear of the wearer, tucks formed along the forward and rearward edges and at the center of each concave section, and an elastic band around the entire periphery of the major piece; a minor piece of biodegradable material, the minor piece being positionable over the face of the wearer, the minor piece having an elongated upper edge positionable beneath the eyes and above the nose of the wearer and an elongated lower edge positionable across the throat of the wearer, the minor piece also having similarly shaped short side edges coupling the elongated upper and lower edges to form a generally rectangular configuration, each side edge including linear sections with a centrally disposed concave section positionable beneath the ear of the wearer, a tuck formed along the forward and rearward edges and at the center of each concave section, and an elastic band along the majority of the extent of the elongated upper and lower edges of the minor piece; and 


 stitching coupling the linear sections of the minor piece with the linear sections of the major piece to form partially elastic ear openings therebetween and to also form an elastic neck opening between the rearward edge of the major piece and the lower edge of the minor piece, and to also form an elastic eye opening between the forward edge of the major piece and the upper edge of the minor piece.
2. A one piece garment constructed for use in a health care environment, the garment including: a major portion positionable over the head of the wearer, the major portion having a forward edge positionable across the forehead of the wearer and a rearward edge positionable across the back of the head of the wearer, the major portion having first regions forming upwardly extending recesses for the upper parts of a wearer's ears; a minor portion positionable over the face of the wearer, the minor portion having an upper edge positionable beneath the eyes and above the nose of the wearer and a lower edge positionable across the throat of the wearer, the minor portion having second regions forming downwardly extending recesses for the lower parts of a wearer's ears; and means coupling the major and minor portions to form ear openings through the cooperable positioning of the first and second regions and to also form a neck opening between the rearward edge of the major portion and the lower edge of the minor portion, and to also form an eye opening between the forward edge of the major portion and the upper edge of the minor portion. 


 3. The garment as set forth in claim 2 and further including tucks formed along the forward and rearward edges and an elastic component around the periphery of the major portion.
4. The garment as set forth in claim 2 and further including tucks formed along the upper and lower edges and an elastic component along the majority of the extent of the upper and lower edges of the minor portion.
5. The garment as set forth in claim 2 wherein the major and minor pieces are fabricated of disposable, biodegradable material.
6. The garment as set forth in claim 2 wherein the major and minor pieces are fabricated of washable fabric material.
