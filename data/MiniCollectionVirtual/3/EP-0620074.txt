<ABSTRACT>
When an insulating mat 10 coated with a metal foil 12 is being fastened to a metal plate 11 by means of a welding stud 1, an annular holding-down device 13 surrounding the stud head 3 is arranged on the welding tool 9 in order to prevent an electrical short circuit between the metal foil 12 and the stud head 3. The holding-down device 13 compresses the insulating mat 10 during the welding operation and holds the metal foil 12 at a distance from the inner surface of the stud head 3. Insulation 6 surrounding the stud shank 2 over part of its length prevents electrical contact between the metal foil 12 and the stud shank 2.

A method of fixing an elastically deformable material layer (10) having an electrically
conductive surface region (12) on a metallic support (11) by means of a welding stud (1)

which is pushed through the material layer (10) and is arc-welded with its tip (4) to the support
(11), which has at its rear end a head (3) retaining the material layer (10), and which is

insulated to prevent electrical contact with the conductive surface region (12), wherein
contact with the stud shaft (2) is possible within an insulated shaft region only,

   
characterised in that
 the material layer (10) during the welding process is compressed
to such an extent that its conductive surface region (12) is maintained spaced from

the stud head (3).
The method of claim 1, wherein the material layer (10) is compressed by means of a
hold-down member (13) which surrounds the welding stud (1).
An apparatus for fixing an elastically deformable material layer (10) having an electrically
conductive surface region to a metallic support (11), comprising

   a welding stud (1) which is provided with a head (3) at its rear end and with an insulation
(6),

   a welding device (9) for establishing an arc between the tip (4) of the welding stud
(1), which has been pushed through the material layer (10), and the support (11), and

   a hold-down member (13) by which the material layer (10) can be compressed during
the welding step,

   
characterised in that
 the head (3) of the welding stud (1) is not insulated and the
hold-down member (13) permits compressing the material layer (10) to such an extent that

its conductive surface region, during the welding step, is maintained spaced from the stud
head (3) and can contact the stud shaft (2) within an insulated shaft region only.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the hold-down member (13) is formed as an annular
body surrounding the welding stud (1).
The apparatus of claim 3 or claim 4, wherein the hold-down member (13) is connected
to the welding device (9), preferably in a detachable manner and preferably so as to

be adjustable in the axial direction of the welding stud (1). 
The method of claim 1 or claim 2 or the apparatus of any one of claims 3 to 5,
wherein the insulation (6) comprises a coating provided on the stud shaft (2), preferably a

lacquer and/or a sleeve surrounding the shaft (2).
The method or apparatus of claim 6, wherein the insulation (6) is provided on the
rear portion of the stud shaft (2) only, preferably extending from the stud head (3) to substantially

one-half the shaft length.
The method or apparatus of claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the front end of the insulation
(6) is chamfered toward the stud tip (4) and the stud axis (7).
The method of any of claims 1, 2 and 6 to 8 or the apparatus of any of claims 3 to 9,
wherein the stud tip (4) is formed as a nail tip.
