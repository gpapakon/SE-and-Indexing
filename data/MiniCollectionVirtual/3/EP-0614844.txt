<ABSTRACT>
A linear motor is used to actuate an elevator door 
in response to a control signal for counteracting 

rotational torque caused by a variable-length moment arm 
(X1) about the center of gravity of the door by varying 

the magnitude of a linear force (F
lin
) exerted on the 
door acting through a fixed-length moment arm (H
cg
) about 
the center of gravity of the door for providing an 

opposing rotational torque, thereby counteracting the 
rotational torque caused by the normal force (F
n
). The 
first and second rotational torques may be controlled to 

decrease and increase linearly as the door goes through 
its motion. In this way, the velocity profile varies in 

a curve similar to one side of the major axis of an 
ellipse. The normal force may be provided so as to 

levitate the door to reduce gravitational forces acting 
on door rollers. The control may be carried out in an 

open- or closed-looped fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to elevators and, more 
particularly, to means and methods for actuating elevator 
doors. Elevator door systems generally consist of single or 
dual sliding doors which are normally powered to provide 
for automatic opening and closing. The actual door 
panels slide open in a horizontal plane to provide access 
and close to provide security to the elevator 
passengers. Traditionally, these automatic operation 
systems have been powered by an electric motor which 
provides rotational torque, as shown in Fig. 1. A 
mechanical linkage system is there shown that converts 
the rotational force produced by the motor into a linear 
force required to move the door. Two common forms of 
mechanical linkages used include a two-bar linkage and a 
threaded lead screw. The concept being advanced by the present invention 
is to replace the combination of rotational motor and 
linkage with a linear electric motor. Linear electric 
motors have been suggested in the prior art for operating 
sliding doors and elevator doors. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,462,883 shows a sliding 
door actuated by a linear inducting motor having a 
control circuit including a plurality of switches 
sequentially actuated by the door moving in either 
direction for effecting variable deceleration. Speed 
sensing is also used to modify the deceleration control. U.S. Pats. No. 4,067,144 and 4,090,113 disclose a 
method of driving a door of an automatic door assembly by 
a linear motor mounted within the automatic door  
 
assembly. The door is driven by a normal propulsion 
force which is augmented during a final portion of the 
stroke of the door, thereby overcoming the reaction force 
of cushioning devices provided near the ends of the door 
stroke. U.S. Pat. No. 3,872,622 discloses a linear motor for 
driving a pair of sliding doors, wherein the stator is 
fixed relative to the frame of the doors and its armature 
connected to a pulley and rope assembly, which is movable 
therewith to effect opening of the doors. Means are 
provided for adjusting the axis of rotation of the 
pulleys in three planes to adjust the tension on the rope 
and adjust the alignment of the pulleys. Linear motors are known for various types of doors, 
as shown, for example, in U.S. Pats. No. 5,134,324; 
4,858,452; 4,188,552; 3,793,944; 4,365,442; and 
3,708,915. Various speed control and control circuits are known 
for linear motors, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 
3,891,907 and British Patent Specification 1,148,144. However, inasmuch as it is
