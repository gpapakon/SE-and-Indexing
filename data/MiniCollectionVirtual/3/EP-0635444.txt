<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface winder with
recycled mandrels and method and, more particularly, to a
surface winder wherein the web is enveloped directly around
the mandrel so as to develop, in effect, a coreless" log of
convolutely wound material.Document US-A-4,783,015, on which the preamble
of claims 1 and 9 is based discloses a
surface winder comprising a frame providing a winding path,
first winding drum means on said frame for continuously
advancing a web in said path and positioned on one side
thereof, means on said frame for introducing mandrels
sequentially into said path for contact with said web, second
winding drum means on said frame on the other side of the
path for coaction with said first winding drum means in
developing a convolutely wound log of said web, and means on
said frame for stripping each mandrel sequentially out of its
associated log.The aim of the invention
is to provide a winder which employs free"
mandrels which are pulled out of the finished log and
thereafter recycled into the winding process. Recirculated
mandrels have been used for a long time -- see Patent
3,148,843. The main objective of the invention is to produce
a wound product without separate core material. It is also
desirable to have a hole in the center of the product so that
a variety of dispensers can be used. The hole is preferably
small, in the range of 9.5 mm (.375 inches) to 19 mm (.750
inches), so that the rolls cut from the log are stable. By
stable, we mean that the wound structure will not collapse or
unravel internally during cutting, packaging, shipping, etc.
Larger holes tend to require a fixing agent" to stabilize
the area near the core".This objective is achieved by a surface winder and a method of winding
according respectively to claims 1 and 9.Another objective is to wind these products in a
high speed, continuous manner. Currently the products are
wound onto free mandrels but in a start/stop operation. These
winders are typically limited in production due to the need
to decelerate the entire line (unwind, embosser, rewind) to
zero web speed during the transfer process.Typical center winder technology also does not
respond to this need because the small diameter mandrels
would not have adequate stiffness to rotate at high speeds.
For a 2.54 meters (100 inch) wide winder running at 12.7
meters per second (2,500 FPM) the minimum mandrel diameter is
about 38 mm (1.5 inches). Hence, the combination of
production requirements and small hole size negate the center
winding option.Further
