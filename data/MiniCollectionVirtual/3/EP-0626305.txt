<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle steering for turning the steerable wheels of a 
vehicle having a fluid motor with a housing (11) defining a fluid 

chamber (13) and a piston (14) in the chamber dividing the chamber 
into first (16) and second (18) chamber portions. A rotatable 

steering input member (33) is supported by the housing. A 
rotatable follow-up member (100) is associated with the piston and 

rotatable upon movement of the piston in the chamber. A 
valve controls pressurized fluid flow to the first and 

second chamber portions. The valve comprises first (40) and 
second (41) relatively movable valve parts. One of the valve 

parts is connected with the input member and the other of 
the valve parts is connected with the follow-up member 

forming a unit therewith (116). The unit has a surface (129,134) against 
which fluid pressure in the first and second chamber 

portions acts tending to create an axial force on the unit. 
Pressure is applied to another surface area (136) of the unit to 

balance the axial force acting on the unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressurized fluid
operated mechanism, and in particular, relates to an
apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 1.
Such an apparatus is known from FR-A-2 117 477This integral power steering gear includes a housing
defining a chamber. A piston is located within the chamber
dividing the chamber into first and second chamber portions. The
piston has a series of rack teeth formed thereon. The rack teeth
mesh with a sector gear which is fixed to an output shaft. The
output shaft is connected with a steering linkage connected with
the steerable wheels of a vehicle to steer the vehicle when the
output shaft rotates.The housing further includes a fluid inlet port and a fluid
outlet port. The inlet port is connected with the discharge
passage of a hydraulic pump. The outlet port is connected with a
return passage of the pump. A valve assembly including a pair of
relatively rotatable valve elements is supported by the housing. 
The valve assembly controls the flow of pressurized fluid between
the pump and one or the other of the first and second chambers.
The valve assembly controls the direction and amount of
steering. Pressurized fluid moves the piston and thereby rotates
the output shaft. One of the valve elements is connected to a
manually rotatable input shaft which is rotated by the manually
operated steering wheel. The other of the valve members is
connected with a follow-up member which rotates in response to
movement of the piston.The follow-up member is a ball screw drive
comprising a worm disposed in an axial bore formed in the
piston. The worm and the bore in the piston are helically
grooved to receive a plurality of balls therebetween. The
grooves cooperate with balls to rotate the worm upon axial
movement of the piston. Thus, the valve part connected with the
follow-up member will rotate. In the event of a loss of fluid
pressure, the follow-up member is rotated directly by the input
shaft because of a mechanical connection between the input shaft
and the follow-up member. Manual rotation of the follow-up
member causes the balls to move the piston axially which rotates
the output shaft to effect manual steering of the vehicle.The known mechanism also includes a check valve
located in the housing. The check valve allows circulation of
fluid between the first and second chambers when the piston is 
moved manually such as during a steering maneuver occurring
during a loss of fluid pressure. The location of the check valve
in the housing has resulted in
