<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
manufacture of a medicament for the
treatment
and prevention of conditions wherein protein kinase C
(PKC) inhibition is indicated. In particular, the medicament is for
the treatment of cardiovascular and renal
disorders, inflammation, central nervous system
disorders, immunosuppression, and septic shock, and to
the use of certain 4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrrolo(2,3-c)azepine-8-ones
in the manufacture of medicaments for
the treatment of such conditions.Protein kinase C is a calcium and phospholipid
activated enzyme that plays a significant role in
mediating the effects of a host of hormones,
neurotransmitters, growth factors, antigens, and
inflammatory mediators (Nishizuka, Y. (1988) Nature,
334:661). When these extracellular agents bind to their
specific cell surface receptors, they stimulate the
hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine,
or phosphatidylethanolamine, resulting in the
accumulation of diacylglycerol which activates protein
kinase C. This activation of PKC causes specific
cellular substrates to be phosphorylated, resulting in
the regulation of cellular processes which are closely
linked to the physiological control of contractile,
secretory, and proliferative processes (Nishizuka, Y.
(1984) Nature, 308:693). As examples of physiological
response induced by the system in which protein kinase C
participates, there have been reported serotonin release
from platelets (Kaibuchi, et al. (1982) Cell Calcium,
3:323; Kaibuchi, et al. (1985) J. Biol. Chem.,
258:6701), lysosomal enzyme release and superoxide
generation from neutrophils (Kajikawa, et al. (1983)
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commmn.; 116:743; Sehau, et al.
(1983) Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 762:420), histamine 
release from mast cells (Kata Kami, et al. (1982)
Riochem. Biphys. Res. Commun., 121:573), secretion of
aldosterone from adrenal glomerulus (Kojima, et al.
(1983) Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun., 116:555), and
contraction of vascular smooth muscle (Rasmussen, et al.
(1984) Biochem. Biophys. Rec. Commun., 122:776. Thus,
it has been demonstrated that protein kinase C takes
part in many important physiological responses invivo.
Therefore, an inhibitor of protein kinase C would be
expected to be useful in the treatment of cardiovascular
and renal disorders, inflammation, immunosuppression,
septic shock and central nervous system disorders.It has now been found that certain 4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrrolo(2,3-c)azepine-8-ones
previously
described as alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents and
antineoplastic
