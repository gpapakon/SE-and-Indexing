<ABSTRACT>
The integral assembly (11) is composed of two complementary parts (12, 13) joined by an associated seam (14), namely an all-around main anteroposterior part (12) and an abdominal part (13) which is made of more extensible material, so that this abdominal part allows freer expansion of the abdomen; a peripheral band (15) is additionally associated with the integral assembly (11), while being connected to the said assembly by seams (16, 17) which are arranged so that this band can exert an additional supporting force on the subpubic and/or preumbilical region.

A dorso-abdominal support belt constituted by unitary
assembly having a crotch piece, and organized to exert

permanent compression on the zone concerned of the body,
characterized in that the unitary assembly (11) comprises

two complementary portions (12, 13) connected together by
an associated seam (14), said portions comprising an

enveloping front-and-back main portion (12) made of a first
elastic textile material selected to exert controlled

support, and an abdominal portion (13) made of a second
elastic textile material which is substantially more

stretchable than said first material, such that said
abdominal portion (13) allows freer swelling of the

abdomen, and in that a peripheral band (15) is connected to
the unitary assembly (11) via seams (16, 17) relating to

the front middle zone and/or to the back middle zone of
said band, the remainder of the band resting freely against

the surface of said unitary assembly, in order that such
peripheral band exerts additional support in the

super-pubic and/or pre-umbilical zone.
A support belt according to claim 1, characterized in
that the abdominal portion (13) of the unitary assembly

(11) is connected to the main portion (12) of said assembly

via a U-shaped seam (14) whose curved portion is essentially
covered by the front portion of the peripheral band

(15).
A support belt according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the unitary assembly (11) includes on one side a

hook-fastened placket (18) for making said belt easier to
put on.
A support belt according to claim 3, characterized in
that the hook fastening (18) includes a plurality of rows 

of hooks so as to enable the circumferential size of said
belt to be adjusted.
A support belt according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the unitary assembly (11) is reinforced

by stiffening in order to obtain better support,
preferably with two front stiffeners (20) and two back

stiffeners (21).
A support belt according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the seams (16, 17) connecting the

peripheral band (15) of the unitary assembly (11) form at
least one front middle fixing line (16) and at least one

back middle fixing line (17), said two fixing lines (16,
17) being the only points of connection between said band

and said unitary assembly.
A support belt according to claim 6, characterized in
that the front middle fixing line (16) is disposed in the

super-pubic zone of the unitary assembly (11) and the back
middle fixing line (17) is disposed in the top back zone of

said unitary assembly.
A support belt according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that on each side the peripheral band (15)

has a gap provided with a plurality of rows of hooks (22),
thereby enabling the circumferential size of said band to

be adjusted.
A support belt according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the peripheral band (15) is made of

an elastic textile material, said material being preferably
essentially identical to the first material constituting

the unitary assembly (11).
