<ABSTRACT>
A pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process for purifying 
or separating gases employs, in addition to a standard PSA 

cycle comprising an adsorption step (a), one or more 
cocurrent depressurization steps (b) for equalization or 

providing purge gas, a countercurrent depressurization step 
(c), a countercurrent purge step (d), and a repressurization 

step (f), an additional countercurrent desorption step (e) 
performed in conjunction with the first countercurrent 

desorption step at above atmospheric pressure and a 
countercurrent purge step at about the adsorption 

temperature which can provide increased capacity and 
recovery as compared to PSA processes that only have one 

countercurrent depressurization step or otherwise do not 
have a countercurrent purge step. Preferabl
y the pressure 
reduction during the second countercurrent depressurization 

step is accomplished by passing another stream from the 
process, such as the effluent from the first countercurrent 

desorption step, as a motive gas through an ejector which is 
in operative communication with the adsorber bed undergoing 

the second countercurrent desorption step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to pressure swing adsorption (PSA) 
processes and more particularly to improved PSA processes for the separation or 
purification of gases wherein multiple countercurrent depressurization steps are 
employed in conjunction with a countercurrent purge step. PSA processes provide an efficient and economical means for separating a 
multi-component gas stream containing at least two gases having different adsorption 
characteristics. The more strongly adsorbed gas can be an impurity which is removed 
from the less strongly adsorbed gas which is taken off as product, or, the more strongly 
adsorbed gas can be the desired product which is separated from the less strongly 
adsorbed gas. For example, carbon monoxide and light hydrocarbons can be removed 
from a hydrogen-containing feedstream to produce a purified (99+ %) hydrogen stream 
for a hydrocracking or other catalytic process where these impurities could adversely 
affect the catalyst or the reaction. Similarly, more strongly adsorbed gases, such as 
ethylene, can be recovered from a feedstream to produce an ethylene-rich product. In PSA processes, a multi component gas is typically passed to at least one of a 
plurality of adsorption zones at an elevated pressure effective to adsorb at least one 
component, i.e. the more strongly adsorbed components, while at least one other 
component passes through, i.e. the less strongly adsorbed components. At a defined 
time, the passing of feedstream to the adsorber is terminated and the adsorption zone is 
depressurized by one or more cocurrent depressurization steps wherein the pressure is 
reduced to a defined level which permits the separated, less strongly adsorbed 
component or components remaining in the adsorption zone to be drawn off without 
significant concentration of the more strongly adsorbed components. Then, the 
adsorption zone is depressurized by a countercurrent depressurization step wherein the 
pressure in the adsorption zone is further reduced by withdrawing desorbed gas 
countercurrently to the direction of the feedstream. Finally, the adsorption zone is 
purged and repressurized. Such PSA processing is disclosed in US-A-3,430,418; US-A-3,564,816  
 
and in US-A-3,986,849 and described in these patents, the contents of which 
are incorporated herein by reference, the PSA process is generally carried out in a 
sequential processing cycle that includes each bed of the PSA system. The more strongly adsorbed components, i.e., the adsorbate, are removed

A pressure swing adsorption process for separating 
a first component from a feedstream comprising said first 

component and at least one other component, wherein a 
plurality of adsorber beds are employed and each of said 

adsorber beds is subjected to a repetitive cycle comprising 
the steps of: 


(a) passing the feedstream to a first adsorber bed containing 
adsorbent having adsorptive capacity for said 

other component at effective adsorption conditions 
including an adsorption pressure and temperature, and 

withdrawing a product stream enriched in said first 
component relative to the feedstream from the first 

adsorber bed; 
(b) cocurrently depressurizing the first adsorber bed to an 
equalization pressure that is lower than the adsorption 

pressure and passing the effluent therefrom to a second 
adsorber bed being repressurized; 
(c) countercurrently depressurizing the first adsorber bed 
to a first desorption pressure that is above 

atmospheric pressure and lower than the equalization 
pressure and effective to desorb said other component 

and withdrawing a first desorption effluent comprising 
said other component; 
(d) countercurrently purging the first adsorber bed with a 
purge feed comprising said first component at about the 

adsorption temperature and withdrawing a purge effluent 
comprising said other component; 
(e) either simultaneously with or subsequently to said 
countercurrently purging further countercurrently 

depressurizing the first adsorber bed to a second 
desorption pressure that is lower than the first 

desorption pressure and effective further to desorb 
said other component and withdrawing a second 

desorption effluent stream comprising said other 
component; and

first desorption effluent from step (c) through an ejector in operative communication 

with a third adsorber bed undergoing step (e) thereby causing the third adsorber bed to
