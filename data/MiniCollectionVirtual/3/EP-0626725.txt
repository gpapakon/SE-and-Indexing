<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layer lead-frame (10) for a semiconductor 
device (30) includes a signal layer (12) made of a metal 

strip having a signal pattern including a plurality of lead 
lines. A power supply layer (14) is adhered and laminated 

to the signal layer and a ground layer (20) is adhered and 
laminated to the power supply layer (14). A ceramic plate 

(22) made of a ferro-electric substance is disposed between 
the power supply (14) and ground (20) layers. Conductive 

adhesive material (24) is disposed between said ceramic 
plate (22) and said first metal layer (14), and between 

and adhering to said ceramic plate (22) and said second 
metal layer (20). This enables an increased decoupling 

capacitance to be included in the lead-frame (10) and 
thereby reduce noise in the semiconductor device (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lead-frame and,
more particularly, relates to a multi-layer lead-frame
for a resin-sealed type semiconductor device, which
includes a signal layer, at least two metal plates or
planes, and a hermetically sealed resin.A conventionally known multi-layer lead-frame
for a semiconductor device comprises at least three
conducting layers, i.e., a signal layer, a power supply
layer and a ground layer, which are affixed or laminated
to each other, in turn, by means of electrically
insulated films made of, for example, polyimide.In such a multi-layer lead-frame, if a
decoupling capacitor is disposed between the power supply
layer and the ground layer, a kind of electrical noise,
called "bounce", can be reduced and therefore the change
or variation of the electrical voltage in the power
supply system or the ground system due to switching
operation of the semiconductor chip can be advantageously
minimized.Using such a multi-layer lead-frame enables the
mounting of a relatively high-power semiconductor chip on
the metal plane, due to the heat radiation from the metal
plane. Also, the metal plane can be used as a ground
layer or a power supply layer to improve the electrical
characteristics of the semiconductor device.Recently, however, since high-speed electronic
devices have become more and more in demand, a voltage
reduction can occur in the power supply and ground
systems due to the simultaneous switching of the input
and output buffers. This would lead an error in
operation. In order to solve the above problems and improve the
electronic device, it has been proposed that the electrostatic
capacitance of the decoupling capacitor is
increased. In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 4-73825, an insulation sheet is disposed
between the power supply layer and the ground layer. Such
an insulation sheet is made from an insulation resin that
contains a ferro-electric substance such as tantalate oxide
powder or barium titanate powder, to increase the electrostatic
capacitance of the decoupling capacitor.However, this multi-layer lead-frame has the
following problems. That is to say, although a ferro-electric
powder is contained in the insulation resin, it
has been found that the expected theoretical value of
electrostatic capacitance could not be obtained, even
though the reasons are not clearly understood. For
example, an insulation sheet containing barium titanate
powder has a dielectric constant (ε) of about 10.As a decoupling capacitor having a large electrostatic
capacitance
