<ABSTRACT>
Method for remote determination of the three-dimensional speed of a fluid such as air or water, consisting in emitting signals of a defined frequency in at least three different directions by means of a planar array of transducers, and, by means of these transducers, picking up the acoustic signals backscattered by the fluid, the method being characterised in that it consists in emitting trains of signals at different defined frequencies f1, f2, f3 first of all in a defined direction D1 then in a defined direction D2, and finally in a defined direction D3 and then in picking up all the signals backscattered by the fluid. The invention makes it possible to enhance the accuracy and to increase the maximum range of the measurements.

A method of remotely determining the three-dimensional
velocity of a fluid such as air or water,

the method consisting in emitting acoustic signals of
determined frequency in at least three different

directions by means of an array of transducers (10),
to pick up by means the same transducers the acoustic

signals backscattered by the fluid, and to determine
the velocities of the fluid in said directions from

the frequency shifting between the emitted signals
and the picked-up signals, characterized in that the

method consists in emitting a train of signals with
determined durations and determined different

frequencies in one above direction D1 then in another
D2 of these directions, and so on until said train of

signals has been emitted successively in all said
directions, then in picking up all the backscattered

signals, in processing simultaneously the picked-up
signals to obtain frequency spectra (20) following

one another in time for each of the said directions,
and in deducing therefrom the velocities of the fluid

at different distances in each of the said
directions.
A method according to claim 1, characterized
in that the processing of the picked-up signals

consists essentially in amplifying them, in
digitizing them, in combining them mutually to obtain

signals corresponding to the emission directions, and
in applying fast Fourier transforms thereto.
A method according to claim 1, characterized
in that the processing of the picked-up signals

consists essentially in amplifying them, in 
digitizing them, in applying fast Fourier transforms

thereto, and in mutually combining them to obtain
signals corresponding to the emission directions.
A method according to claim 1, characterized
in that the processing of the picked-up signals

consists essentially in amplifying them, in mutually
combining them to obtain analog signals corresponding

to the emission directions, then in digitizing the
signals obtained in this way and in applying fast

Fourier transforms thereto.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to
4, characterized in that the method consists, for

measuring velocities at short distances, in
permutating the emission order of the signals at

different frequencies and the order of the emission
directions.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the method

consists in verifying the compatibility of the
velocities obtained at different emission frequencies

for a given emission direction, and for emission
directions that are symmetrical about the vertical.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the number of

different frequencies emitted is not less than 3.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the method

consists in emitting trains of signals at five
different frequencies successively in five different

directions. 
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the method

consists in intermittently emitting signals at a
single frequency to determine the order of magnitude

of the frequency offset between emitted signals and
picket-up signals, or signals of differrent

frequencies separated by relatively large
differences, greater than the frequency offsets to be

measured.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the fluid is

atmospheric air, the emitted signals have durations
of the order of 200 ms and the emission frequencies

are separated by about 75 Hz, the range of emission
frequencies being centered on a value of about 2.1

kHz.
A method according to any one of claims 1
to 9, characterized in that the fluid is atmospheric

air, the emitted signals have durations of the order
of 600 ms and the emission frequencies are separated

by about 25 Hz, the range of emission frequencies
being centered on a value of about 700 Hz.
A method according to any one of claims 1
to 9, characterized in that the fluid is water and

the emitted signals have durations of the order of 40
ms and frequencies that are separated by 500 Hz, the

emission frequency range being centered on a value of
about 40 kHz.
