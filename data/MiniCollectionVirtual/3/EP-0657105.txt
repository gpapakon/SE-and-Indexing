<ABSTRACT>
Reduced-calorie (low calorie) coating composition for frozen desserts, in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion comprising 40 to 55 % by weight of water and 2 to 4 % by weight of an emulsifying system comprising a decaglycerol ester of deca-fatty acids. The reduced-calorie coating composition can be used to form a film or a layer or alternatively an inclusion in a frozen confectionery product.

<CLAIMS>
Water-in-oil emulsion for coating ice desserts, which
includes 40 to 55 % by weight of water and 2 to 4 % by

weight of an emulsifying formulation comprising an ester of
decaglycerol and fatty deca-acids.
Emulsion according to claim 1 which includes compounds
added to increase the viscosity, chosen between a sodium

salt of phosphated mono- and diglycerides acting as a
secondary emulsifier and microcrystalline cellulose acting

as a thickening agent.
Emulsion according to claim 1, wherein the aqueous
phase contains one or more sweeteners, flavouring agents,

colorants or preservatives and is acidified to a weakly
acidic pH with a food acid.
Process for producing a coating composition with a low
calorie content, which comprises steps consisting of

separately mixing water with a preservative, a flavouring
agent and sweetening agents at a weakly acidic pH to

produce the aqueous phase, of separately mixing a fatty
phase with the emulsifier consisting of an ester of

decaglycerol and fatty deca-acid at a temperature at which
the fats are liquid, and of introducing the aqueous phase

into the fats with vigorous mixing, the aqueous phase
representing 40 to 55 % by weight and the emulsifying

formulation representing 2 to 4 % by weight of the final
composition.
Process according to claim 4, which includes the
pasteurization of the composition in a mixing installation

for high-temperature pasteurization consisting of a high-shear
mixing reservoir, a heating/cooling exchanger and

tubes for holding the composition at 70-85째C for 4 to
8 min, cooling this composition to 38-45째C and then storing

it at this temperature with gently stirring until used. 
Process according to claim 4, which comprises freezing
the com
position and storing this composition at a
temperature below -18째C until it is unfrozen and remixed

vigorously for use.
Process for coating a portion of ice confectionery,
which comprises first of all cooling it to a temperature

equal to or below -30째C and of immersing the previously
cooled portion in a coating composition with a low calorie

content in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion, a
composition which includes 40 to 55 % by weight of water

and 2 to 4 % by weight of an emulsifying formulation
comprising an ester of decaglycerol and fatty deca-acids.
Process for moulding portions of ice confectionery,
which comprises coating a mould with ice by forming a

coating of ice on the inner surface of the said mould,
inserting in the mould coated with ice on its surface a

liquid coating with a low calorie content according to any
one of claims 1 to 3, and of sucking out the excess liquid

coating to form a shell, filling the shell with ice cream,
adding a supplementary quantity of liquid coating,

inserting a stick and demoulding by unfreezing the ice
coating.
Use of the coating composition with a low calory
content according to any one of claims 1 to 3 for forming a

film or layer or even an inclusion in an ice dessert.
Process for co-extruding the composition with a low
calorie content according to any one of claims 1 to 3 with

an ice cream from a die for forming a centre or a veined
layer.
