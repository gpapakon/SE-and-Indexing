<ABSTRACT>
A post inversion metastable syrup comprising a continuous or co-continuous 
rubber like composite phase and a discontinuous or co-continuous 

resin phase may be particulated by the application of a shear field to yield a 
stable syrup comprising a dispersed rubber-like composite phase and a 

continuous resin phase. The application of a uniform shear field to the post 
inversion metastable syrup is particularly desirable since it results in a high 

degree of control over the size and distribution of the dispersed rubber-like 
composite phase. As a result it is possible to optimize the particle size 

distribution in an impact modified thermoplastic and obtain better or a better 
balance of properties. The present invention also provides in cooperating 

arrangement reactors or devices to produce a post inversion metastable syrup, a 
device to subject the metastable syrup to a shear field and a polymerization plant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process to improve
the properties or balance of properties of impact modified
thermoplastic resins. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a process that applies a uniform shear
field to create or alter a dispersed rubber-like composite
phase in a syrup comprising a continuous resin phase.The field of the manufacture of impact modified
plastics is relatively old and the current industrial
processes for their manufacture are fairly well known.
According to conventional technology typically a solution of
rubber, typically comprising 1 to about 20, preferably from
3 to 12 weight %, most preferably 4 to 10 weight % of rubber
dissolved in one or more monomers is polymerized in a first
stage reactor under mechanical agitation. Whether the
polymerization occurs in a batch, stirred plug flow or
continuous stirred tank reactors, almost all prior art and
disclosures clearly teach that the particle size, particle
size distribution and morphology of the dispersed rubber-like
composite phase of the final product is largely
determined during particulation in the early part of the
process.Particulation is the generic term used to describe the
formation of the dispersed rubber-like composite phase
regardless of its mechanism. In the production of high impact polystyrene in a batch process or in a
stirred plug flow reactor, the rubber-like composite phase is the continuous
phase and the resin phase (monomer/resulting polymer phase) is dispersed.
Typically, in conventional processes, as the polymerization proceeds in time with
a batch reactor or in space with a stirred plug flow reactor, at some point
between 5 and 20 % conversion the system undergoes particulation by phase
inversion under the application of a shear field generated by mechanical
agitation. That is the rubber-like composite phase becomes the dispersed phase
and the resin phase becomes the continuous phase. This does not happen
instantaneously but occurs over a considerable period of time or space, typically
from 20 to 50 minutes or reactor space which produces 2 to 8 % conversion.
That is the rubber-like composite phase and resin phase become co-continuous
for a period of time or space before the particulation process is complete.The ternary phase diagram of the styrene-polystyrene-polybutadiene
system has been well studied and is well known. For example, the phase
diagram and what happens during the polymerization of high impact polystyrene
is discussed in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology
