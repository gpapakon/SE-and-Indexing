<ABSTRACT>
Screw thread connection between at least two parts which are formed with parallel and planar surfaces and are to be connected to one another, having at least in each case one connection surface (2) and a mating surface (3), of which the separating-gap plane runs at an angle with respect to the screw thread axis, the separating-gap plane running at an angle in the region of approximately 90@ with respect to the screw thread axis, and having an operating part (7), provided with a female thread and into which a set screw (21) can be screwed, and further having a connection part, exhibiting a planar connection surface (2) which runs in the separating-gap plane, and/or a component (9) which is in operative connection with said connection part, and having a planar mating surface (3) which runs in the separating-gap plane, is held under prestress, acting in the screw thread axis, with respect to the connection surface (2) and belongs to the operating part (7) or an element which is in operative connection with said operating part, and having a tilting cam (10) which is fitted, in the separating-gap plane, on the connection surface (2) or on the mating surface, in the peripheral surface region.
