<ABSTRACT>
A function ally gradient composite material containing 
copper and carbon as main components and having a predetermined 

shape, in which the composition ratio of the copper to 
the carbon in the material continuously varies in at least one 

predetermined direction. The material is manufactured, for 
example, by impregnating carbon felt with a resin and thermocompressively 

molding the impregnated felt (step S101), carbonizing 
the resin by baking (step S102) to provide a preformed 

carbon material (step S104). Pyrolytic carbon is 
thereafter deposited in the preformed carbon material by the 

CVI method (step S105) to provide a carbon material having the 
bulk density varying in a predetermined direction (step S107). 

After the wettability of the carbon material against copper is 
improved by siliconization (step S108), pores of the carbon 

material are impregnated with copper (step S109) to obtain a 
functionally gradient composite material of copper and carbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite material 
with graded function (hereinafter referred to as functionally 
gradient composite material) which consists principally of 
copper and carbon, and more particularly to a copper-carbon 
functionally gradient composite material suitable for use in a 
nuclear fusion reactor as materials for wall members or members 
of high heat flux portions which should be durable against 
irradiation of high energy electron beam, ion beam or high-speed 
neutrons, and a method for manufacturing the same. Heretofore, as a wall member, particularly as a first 
wall member facing plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor, metal 
materials such as stainless steel or TiC-coated Mo have been 
used. These metals, however, tend to evaporate when heated by 
collision of plasma and to enter the plasma as impurities so 
that the radiation loss of plasma increases and the temperature 
of plasma falls. To eliminate this disadvantage, carbon having the small 
atomic number, especially graphite have been used in order to 
reduce the radiation loss of plasma due to impurities. As the 
reactor wall material facing plasma, isotropic graphite material  
 
of high purity and having fine grain structure has been 
at the focus of attention, but cracks may often be caused in 
it due to thermal shock when subjected to excessive heat load. 
Accordingly, there has recently come into the limelight a 
carbon fiber-reinforced carbon (C/C) composite material having 
high strength, high thermal conductivity and desirable thermal 
shock resistance properties. Such type of carbon material, however, lacks a heat-removing 
function and it starts evaporating or subliming when 
subjected to high-temperature heat load. Accordingly, it is 
necessary to let the carbon material be accompanied by a 
certain kind of cooling means. This is achieved in general by 
bringing the carbon material into contact with metal. For 
instance, brazing is used for uniting copper having high heat 
conductivity with graphite. This method, however, would 
require several kinds of metallic buffer materials and brazing 
filler metals because of the difference in the coefficient of 
thermal expansion between copper and graphite, and it also requires 
quite complicated procedures to provide an integral 
reactor wall member. Furthermore, due to the large difference 
in the coefficient of thermal expansion as mentioned above, 
this method is impractical for the integration into large-sized 
products and requires connection of segmented
