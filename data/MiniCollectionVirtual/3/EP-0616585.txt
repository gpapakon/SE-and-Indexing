<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and system for 
transferring a flowable material from a container to a 
receiver. The method and system are particularly 
suitable for the transfer of hazardous powdered, 
particulate or liquid materials. When hazardous materials (e.g. powders, particulates 
or liquids) are shipped in drums, barrels, packages, 
containers, etc., it is necessary to take special 
precautions in order to prevent pollution of the 
environment and/or health risks in the course of 
transferral of the material from its container to a 
receiver such as another container or vessel, e.g. 
reactor vessel, in which the material is to be stored or 
used. Moreover, the emptied containers must thereafter 
be disposed of in an acceptable manner. EP-A2-0420422 discloses a herbicide container having 
a rigid outer casing accommodating an inner liner. After 
such container has been emptied, the inner liner is 
removed from the container, air is expelled therefrom and 
the liner is then placed in a waste receptacle. The 
outer casing is separately disposed of and, when the 
waste receptacle is filled with liners, it is disposed of 
in its entirety. In the course of removal of the liner 
from the outer casing and expelling of air from the 
liner, there is a possibility of herbicide residues being 
concurrently expelled from the liner and discharged into 
the atmosphere. In addition, the requisite handling of 
the empty container poses a significant health risk to 
the persons handling the emptied containers.  
 The present method and system provides for a means 
whereby a flowable material may be readily transferred 
from a container into a receiver in a safe and 
environmentally acceptable manner. The present invention provides for a method of 
transferring a flowable material from a container to a 
receiver through a flexible tubing which communicates 
with an opening defined in the container and which 
extends outwardly from the container, by establishing 
within the container, after discharge of the material 
therefrom, a pressure less than the ambient pressure so 
as to draw the tubing into the container through said 
opening as a result of the pressure differential created 
between that within the container and the ambient 
pressure. Inasmuch as the material flows out from the 
container through the tubing, even a powdered material is 
transferred in a concentrated, solid stream which may be 
directed to the receiver. As a result, the tendency of 
particles of the material to enter the atmosphere is

collapsible tubing (13) 
which communicates with an opening (29) defined in the 

container (10, 45, 48) and which extends outwardly from the container (10, 45, 48), 
characterized by establishing within the container (10, 45, 48), after 

discharge of the material (20) therefrom, a pressure less than 
the ambient pressure so as to draw the tubing (13) into the 

container (10, 45, 48) through said opening (29) as a result of the 
pressure differential created between that within the 

container (10, 45, 48) and the ambient pressure. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the 
material (20) is transferred from the container (10, 45, 48) to the 

receiver (11) solely under the influence of gravity. 
The method according to claim 2, wherein the 
opening (29) is defined in the container (10, 45) by removing a 

removable upper wall part (12, 37, 46), and the container is inverted 
and positioned above the receiver (11). 
The method according to claim 3, wherein the 

container (10) comprises at least one side wall and opposite 
end walls (12, 15) and said tubing (13) is disposed around the side 

wall and the opening (29) is disposed in one of said end 
walls. 
The method according to claim 3, wherein the 
upper wall part (12, 37, 46) is disposed in a space defined between 

the side wall and the tubing 13. 
The method according to claim 4, wherein the 
tubing (13) is sealingly disposed around the outer surface of 

the side wall.  
 
The method according to claim 4, wherein the 
tubing (13) is sealingly fastened to the inner surface of the 

side wall. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the 
tubing (13) is provided with at least one annular part (47) whose 

outer dimensions exceed the dimensions of said container 
opening (29) so as to form one or more abutment surfaces on 

said annular part (47). 
The method according to claim 8, wherein the 
spacing between the container opening (29) and the adjacent 

annular part (47) as well as each mutual spacing of adjacent 
annular parts does not exceed about twice the axial 

length of the inner space of the container (10, 45, 48) when the 
tubing (13) is in an axially extended condition. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the 
container (10, 48) is disposed within a bag open at one end, said 

open end portion (16) of the bag forming said tubing (13).
