A switch assembly with 

a housing (12) having a base (14) with an opening (15) and at least one stop 
part (26), 
an actuating member (40) which is arranged at least partially in the opening 
(15) and is rotatably attached to the housing (12) and which has a body part 

(42) with a pocket (50, 51), wherein the pocket (50, 51) is in part bounded by 
pocket walls (52, 53) and is open on at least one side, 
at least one coupling element (67, 68) serving to transmit force between the 
actuating member (40) and at least one electric switch member (72), 
a lever (80) with a base part received at least partially by the pocket (50, 51), 
wherein the lever (80) is movable in the pocket (50, 51) between a locking 

position and an unlocked position and has a manually operable actuating arm 
(90) projecting from the base part and at least one stop surface (87, 88) which 

cooperates with the stop part (26) of the housing (12) in order to prevent the 
lever (80) turning in a first direction insofar as the lever (80) is in its locking 

position, and in order to avoid engagement with the stop part (26) insofar as the 
lever (80) has been moved into its unlocked position, so that the lever (80) in 

its unlocked position and the actuating member (40) can be turned relative to 
the housing (12), and 
a spring (94) which biases the lever (80) into its locking position, 
 
characterized in that the base part of the lever (80) is spaced from the pocket walls 

(52, 53) in the locking position of the lever (80) and engages on the pocket walls (52, 
53) in the unlocked position of the lever (80), so that the actuating member (40) can 

turn with the lever (80).  
 
A switch assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that 

a pivot pin (58) is received by at least one bore (20) in the housing (12), 
at least one slot (86) extends through the base part parallel to the axis of the 
pivot pin (58) with its longitudinal alignment lying in a plane which is 

perpendicular to the axis of the pivot pin (58), and 
the pivot pin (58) is received slidably and rotatably by the slot (86). 
A switch assembly according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the actuating 
arm (90) has a central axis (A) which runs to one side of the axis of rotation of the 

lever (80) or the axis of the pivot pin (58) and is spaced therefrom, so that a force 
applied to the lever (80) in the direction of the axis (A), which brings the lever (80) 

into its unlocked position, creates a moment which tends to move the lever (80) and 
the actuating member (40) in a direction opposite to the first direction. 
A switch assembly according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a 
stop arm (34) projects from the housing (12), its free end serving as a stop for the 

lever (80), so that the lever (80) is prevented from turning out of its position of rest in 
a second direction. 
A switch assembly according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that a 
nose (66) projects from the actuating member (40) and cooperates with portion of the 

housing (12), preferably lying in the region of the stop arm (34), in order to limit 
turning of the lever (80) in the first direction. 
A switch assembly according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a 
notch (88) is let into the lever (80) and extend parallel to the axis of rotation of the 

lever (80) or the axis of the pivot pin (58), and in that the bottom surface of the notch 
(88) forms the stop surface of the lever (80).  

 
A switch assembly according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a 
first platform (22) extends beyond one end of the base (14) and has an edge formed as 

stop part (26), and in that a second platform (30) extends beyond another end of the 
base (14) and has an edge (34) which cooperates with the lever (80) in order to prevent 

the lever (80) turning out of its position of rest in a second direction. 
A switch assembly according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
housing (12) comprises two mutually spaced sidewalls (16, 18) which project from 

opposite sides of the base (14), and in that the actuating arm (90) is arranged to move 
in the space between the sidewalls (16, 18). 
A switch assembly according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the 
actuating member (40) has two sidewalls (44, 46) connected together by a body part 

(42), wherein the sidewalls (44, 46) and the body part (42) form the pocket (50, 51). 
A switch assembly according to claim 9, characterized in that the actuating 
member (40) includes a hollow, cylindrical hub (48) which is fixed to the body part 

(42) and extends between the two sidewalls (44, 46). 
A switch assembly according to claim 10, characterized in that a pivot pin (58) 
extends through the cylindrical hub (48) and through bores (56) in the sidewalls (44, 

46) of the actuating member (40). 
A switch assembly according to claim 10 or 11, characterized in that the 
cylindrical hub (48) has end surfaces which are spaced from the sidewalls (44, 46), in 

that the base part of the lever (80) has two sidewalls (81, 82) spaced from one another, 
and in that the cylindrical hub (48) is arranged between the sidewalls (81, 82) of the 

lever (80).
