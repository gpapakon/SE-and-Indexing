<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of silver 
halide photographic processing. It particularly 
relates to a method of using a rinse solution which 
improves the appearance of processed color photographic 
elements. The processing of silver halide color film 
generally involves the steps of color evolution, 
bleaching, fixing, stabilizing or rinsing, and drying. 
The final rinsing bath is generally used to promote 
uniform drainage of solution from the photographic 
elements to avoid the formation of water spots. It may 
also contain an antimicrobial to prevent the growth of 
bacteria and fungi both in the rinse itself and on the 
photographic element. In certain instances the final 
rinse also serves as the washing solution for the color 
film. Nonionic surfactants have been utilized in 
the industry to promote the drainage characteristics of 
the final rinsing solution. It has been found, 
however, that such solutions may cause differential 
drying problems. For example, after the film is 
removed from the final rinse, the final rinse solution 
may be held not only in a thin layer on the surface, 
but in excess in thin liquid droplets by the film 
perforations. When the thin droplets of excess liquid 
burst during or after drying, they may form small 
puddles of excess solution on the gelatin/image layer. 
These puddles dry at a slower rate and result in a 
noticeable mark around the perforation after the film 
completely dries. Some rinsing solutions containing  
 
nonionic surfactants also leave streaks (drying lines) 
and drip marks on the photographic element. U.S. Patent 4,778,748 describes a method of 
processing which utilizes a first stabilizing solution 
having a surface tension of 20 to 78 dyne/cm and a 
second stabilizing solution having a surface tension of 
8 to 60 dyne/cm. The process is used substantially 
without a water washing step to promote conservation. 
There is no mention of drying problems. U.S. Patent 5,110,716 describes a stabilizing 
solution containing a polyoxyalkylene type surface 
active agent which reduces the surface tension of the 
solution and a triazine type or methylol type compound. 
The patent states that the polyoxyalkylene compound 
corrects the running down unevenness and the stains 
caused by the triazine or methylol type compound. European Patent Application 465,228 A3 
describes a method of processing a silver halide 
photographic element containing more than 80 mol % 
chloride which utilizes a stabilizer which has a 
surface tension of 15 to 60 dynes/cm
