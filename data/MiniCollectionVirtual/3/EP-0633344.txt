<ABSTRACT>
The iron (1) with a removable tank comprises a water-circulation circuit (5) connected to an evaporation chamber (3). It comprises, as accessories, a series of cassette-type refill tanks (7) and a receptacle (8) suitable for receiving a refill tank (7). Connection means are suitable for connecting the water-circulation circuit (5) to the refill tank (7). These refill tanks (7) can be filled with a product (6) selected from the following:     - water   - demineralised water   - water laden with a laundry treatment product (see Figure 1).

A smoothing iron having a removable reservoir including a housing
(8) designed to house a refill reservoir (7), a water circulation

circuit (5) connected to a steam-generating chamber (3), and
fastening means (9) designed to displace a moving valve (13) closing

an outlet orifice (12) of said reservoir (7), said iron being
characterized in that it includes, as accessories, a set of refill

reservoirs (7) of the cassette type, each of said refill reservoirs
(7) being closed and including an air intake orifice (15) in the top

portion thereof and closed by a second moving valve (16), the iron
(1) including button-forming means (17) designed to displace said

second valve (16), a water-spraying device (10), and second fastening
means (9) designed to connect the water-spraying device (10) to said

refill reservoir (7).

circuit (5) connected to a steam-generating chamber (3), and
fastening means (9) designed to displace a moving valve (13) closing

an outlet orifice (12) of said reservoir (7), said iron being
characterized in that it includes, as accessories, a set of refill

reservoirs (7) of the cassette type, and a second set of refill
reservoirs (19) of the cassette type, each of said refill reservoirs

(7, 19) being closed, including an outlet orifice (12), a moving
valve (13) closing said outlet orifice (12), an air intake orifice

(15) situated in the top portion thereof, and a second moving valve
(16) closing said ai
r intake orifice (15), the iron (1) including a
water-spraying device (10), a second housing (20) designed to house a

reservoir (19) of said second set, second fastening means (9)
designed to connect the water-spraying device (10) to the reservoir

(19) of said second set and to displace the moving valve (13) closing
the outlet orifice of said reservoir (19), and button-forming means

(17) designed to displace the second moving valves (16).
A smoothing iron according to claim 1 or 2, in which said refill
reservoirs (7, 19) can be filled with a product (6) selected from the

following: 

water;
demineralized water; and
water containing a fabric treatment product.
A smoothing iron according to claims 2 and 3, characterized in
that the refill reservoirs (19) of said second set are filled with

water (21) containing a fabric treatment product which does not
withstand high temperatures.
A smoothing iron according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that it includes at least one housing (8, 20)

opening out to a side face (23) of the iron (1).
A smoothing iron according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that it includes at least one housing (8, 20)

opening out to a rear face (24) of the iron (1).
A smoothing iron according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that at least one visible wall (11, 22) of the

refill reservoirs (7, 19) housed in the iron (1) is transparent.
A smoothing iron according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the outlet orifice (12) is situated close to

the bottom of the refill reservoir (7, 19).
A smoothing iron according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that each fastening means (9) of the iron (1) is

constituted by a rod (9) extending parallel to the direction in which
the refill reservoir (7, 19) is inserted in the housing (8, 20) of

the iron (1), said rod (9) being designed to pass through the outlet
orifice (12) and to push the valve (13) against the action of a

resilient return means (14).
A smoothing iron according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the button-forming means (17) is a second rod

(17) extending parallel to the direction in which the refill
reservoir (7, 19) is inserted in the housing (8, 20) of the iron (1), 

said second rod (17) being designed to pass through the air intake
orifice (15) and to push said second valve (16) against the action of

a resilient return means (18).
