<ABSTRACT>
A neuron (100) has a null-inhibiting function so that null 
inputs do not affect the output of the neuron (100) or updating of 

its weights. The neuron (100) provides a net value based on a sum 
of products of each of several inputs, and corresponding weight 

and null values, and provides an output in response to the net 
value. A neural network (40
) which uses such a neuron (100) has 
a first segmented layer (41) in which each segment (50-52) 

corresponds to a manufacturing process step (60-62). Each 
segment of the first layer (41) receives as inputs measured 

values associated with the process step (60-62). A second layer 
(42) connected to the first layer (41) is non-segmented to model 

the entire manufacturing process (80). The first (42) and second 
(43) layers are both unsupervised and competitive. A third layer 

(43) connected to the second layer (42) then estimates 
parameters of the manufacturing process (80) and is unsupervised 

and noncompetitive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to processing systems, and 
more particularly, to neural networks. Artificial neural networks, known also as simply neural 
networks, grew out of attempts to understand the workings of the 
human brain. A neural network is a processing system which 
exists in a massively parallel form, and includes many individual 
processing elements known as neurons. The neuron receives 
several inputs and is connected to other neurons through the 
equivalent of synapses. In one type of neural network, known as a 
competitive neural network, a neuron conditions the inputs by 
weighting functions, sums the weighted inputs, and activates an 
overall output ("fires") if its weighted sum exceeds the weighted 
sums of other neurons in the layer. The weights are adjusted 
through a process of training in which an output in the neuron's 
layer or some other layer is compared to an expected output and a 
feedback signal adjusts the weights until the neural network 
provides the expected output. Neural networks are useful for heuristic tasks for which 
normal computing systems are inefficient or inaccurate, such as 
speech recognition and synthesis, pattern recognition, artificial 
vision, and the like. However, some features of known neural 
networks prevent their use for solving problems for which they 
would normally be ideally suited. For example, a neural network 
may be used to model a manufacturing process. The 
manufacturing process, while generally deterministic, is 
nonetheless affected by many variables and thus is difficult to 
model using normal mathematical models. This neural network 
would receive measured characteristics of a manufactured good 
as inputs, and estimate unknown characteristics of the  
 
manufactured good such as quality and performance compared to 
specifications. However, if this neural network were trained 
using a given set of inputs, it would require all of these inputs to 
be available in order to make an accurate prediction. Frequently 
in manufacturing processes, measurements are lost or 
unobtainable. Conventional neural networks are unable to adjust 
for the missing measurement without distorting the predicted 
outputs and readjusting the weights. What is needed, then, is a 
neural network and a neural processing element which allows 
neural networks to be used for such tasks. Accordingly, the present invention provides, in one form, a 
neuron suitable for manufacturing process parameter estimation 
or the like. A predetermined number of first inputs
