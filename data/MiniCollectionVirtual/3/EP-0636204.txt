<ABSTRACT>
Fan blades (14) of a rotor stage (12) do not have platforms and separate wall members (20) are provided to bridge the space between adjacent blades (14). The wall members (20) define an inner wall of a flow annulus through the rotor (12). Each of the wall members (20) has a plurality of hooks (27) and (28) which extend radially inwardly to engage correspondingly shaped hooks (30) and (31) provided on the radially outer face (18) of the disc (16). Further hooks (29, 38) engage rings (34, 36) mounted on the rotor (12) adjacent the disc (16) to lock the wall member (20) in position. This ensures that the hooks (27) and (28) on the wall member (20) engage the hooks (30) and (31) on the radially outer face (18) of the disc (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to air compressing
rotors and in particular to a fan rotor for a gas turbine
engine.A conventional fan rotor for compressing air
comprises a disc having a plurality or radially extending
blades mounted thereon. The fan blades are mounted on the
disc by inserting the radially inner end of the blades in
correspondingly shaped retention grooves in the radially
outer face of the disc. The fan blades do not have
platforms so the inner wall of an annulus for the
compressed air is formed by fastening separate wall
members to the radially outer face of the disc. The
separate wall members bridge the space between pairs of
adjacent blades to define the inner annulus wall.It is known from EP-A-0370899 to fasten the wall
members, defining the inner wall of the compressed air
annulus, to the disc by feet which extend radially
inward. In the arrangement disclosed in EP-A-0370899 one
of the feet is located in a slot on the radially outer
face of the disc whilst the other foot is fastened to the
disc by a clamping yoke. The clamping yoke ensures
engagement between the foot of the wall member and the
radially outer face of the disc.Disadvantages with this known method of attaching the
wall members to the disc is that the slot in which one of
the feet is located has to be manufactured to within
close tolerances to receive one of the feet of the wall
member and a separate clamping yoke has to be used to
ensure engagement between the other foot of the wall
members and the radially outer face of the disc.The present invention seeks to provide a rotor in
which the inner wall of the flow annulus is defined by a
plurality of wall members which are fastened to the disc
in such away that neither a slot nor a clamping device is
required to ensure engagement between the the feet of the
wall members and the radially outer face of the disc. According to the present invention a rotor for a gas
turbine engine comprises a rotor disc which has a
radially outer face on which a plurality of radially
extending blades are mounted, separate wall members are
provided to bridge the space between adjacent blades to
define an inner wall of a flow annulus through the rotor,
each of the wall members have a plurality of hooks which
extend radially inwardly to engage correspondingly shaped
hooks provided on the radially outer face of the disc, at
least one further hook is provided on each of the wall
members which extends radially outward to engage an
annular member mounted on the rotor adjacent the disc
characterised

<CLAIMS>
A rotor (12) for a gas turbine engine (10)
comprising a rotor disc (16) having a radially outer face

(18) on which a plurality of radially extending blades
(14) are mounted, separate wall members (20) being

provided to bridge the space between adjacent blades (14)
to define an inner wall of a flow annulus through the

rotor (12), each of the wall members (20) having a
plurality of hooks (27,28) which extend radially inwardly

to engage correspondingly shaped hooks (30, 31) provided
on the radially outer face (18) of the disc (16), at

least one further hook (38) is provided on each of the
wall members (20) which extends radially outwards to

engage an annular member (36) mounted on the rotor (12)
adjacent the disc (16) characterised in that the at least

one further hook (38) is urged into engagement with the
annular member (36) by centrifugal forces which in

operation act thereon to ensure engagement of the hooks

that the at least one further hook (38) is connected

directly to the downstream end of the wall member (20)
A rotor (12) as claimed in claim 1 characterised in
that a further hook (29) is provided on each wall member

(20) which extends radially inward to engage an annular
member (34) mounted on the rotor upstream of the disc

(16).
A rotor as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that a strip of flexible material is

provided at the edges of each of the wall member (20)
adjacent the blades (14), the strips of material

effecting a seal between the wall members (20) and
adjacent blades (14).
