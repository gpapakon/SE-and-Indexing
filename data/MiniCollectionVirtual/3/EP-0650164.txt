<ABSTRACT>
In a track jump control device a scanning head (13) for scanning the recording 
track of a disc-shaped recording medium (11) is moved to a target track position. A 

signal obtained by differentiating (25) a tracking error signal (STE) is used as speed 
data to perform a closed loop track jump control operation to achieve direct landing 

on the target track. Track jump control making use of gray code information 
indicating the recording tracks on the recording medium (11) on a track-by-track 

basis is switched (30) to track jump control making use of the differentiated tracking 
error signal or vice versa to realize direct landing on the target track. Circuitry (22, 

23) that forms a speed data signal (VGC) by detecting changes in the gray code 
information is operative to form a high resolution speed data signal by interpolation, 

in which a track pitch is divided by N, N being an integer, by a first control signal 
(TCNT) which is a version in binary form of the tracking error signal and a second 

control signal (TPOL) which is a version in binary form of a signal 90° phase different 
from the tracking error signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to track jump control devices for moving a scanning
head scanning recording tracks on a disc-shaped recording medium to a target track.
This invention may be applied to, for example, an optical disc device in which the
recording track formed on the optical disc is scanned by an optical beam of an optical
head for recording and/or reproducing information signals.As optical discs, there are known an over-writable optical disc, such as a
magneto-optical disc, a write-once type optical disc or an unrewritable ROM type
optical disc.With an optical disc device employing these optical discs as recording media,
focusing servo or tracking servo is applied to an optical head having therein a laser
diode for supplying a data recording and/or reproducing laser beam and a
photodetector for detecting the reflected laser light from the optical disc, whilst the
optical disc is rotated at a constant angular velocity or at a constant linear velocity.
The recording track on the optical disc in the form of a circular pattern is scanned in
this manner by the laser light for performing data recording or reproduction.With such an optical disc apparatus in which a recording track or tracks
formed on an optical disc in a circular pattern is scanned by a light beam from an
optical head for recording and/or reproducing signals along said recording track, it is
necessary to perform tracking control so that the recording track will be correctly
scanned by the beam spot of the light beam scanning the recording track. To this end,
a tracking error signal corresponding to the deviation of the light spot from the
recording track in the track pitch direction is derived from the optical head and fed
back to a tracking actuator driving circuit for bringing the centre of the light beam
spot into coincidence with the track centre, so effecting tracking control. There are
known a three-beam method and a push-pull method as the methods for detecting
tracking errors in the optical disc apparatus.In known optical disc apparatus, when the beam spot traverses the recording
track, a tracking error signal STE which is changed sinusoidally as indicated by the
formula: 
STE = Asin(2π XP)
wherein X denotes the displacement of the beam spot from a track centre of a
recording track TK (n) in the track pitch direction and P denotes the track pitch, is
derived from a detection output from the optical head, as shown in Figure 1, and
tracking control is performed so that the tracking error signal STE will be reduced to
zero.On the
