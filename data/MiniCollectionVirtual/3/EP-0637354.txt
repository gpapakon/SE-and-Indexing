<ABSTRACT>
A compact, self-contained, portable vacuum toilet system (10) is disclosed having a sump (16) for collecting waste liquids by gravity from a toilet (14). A differential pressure operated discharge valve (40) is located in a conduit (38) which connects the sump (16) with a vacuum collection tank (32) for withdrawal of waste liquids during a transport cycle. A differential pressure operated sensor valve (48) and a controller valve (50) regulate operation of the discharge valve (40) in response to a hydrostatic pressure condition inside the sump (16). The sensor valve (48) communicates with sump (16) via sensor pipe (44) and with the controller valve (50) via hose (51). The toilet (14) includes a push button (20) for adding water to the toilet bowl during and immediately after a flush cycle. A sink (26) having its own push button operated valve may also be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-contained lavatory facility for
accumulating and storing waste liquids for subsequent treatment, comprising:
a portable shelter structure containing: a source of waste liquids;a holding sump connected to the waste liquid source for accumulating a
predetermined volume of waste liquids.Such a portable lavatory facility is known from US-A-4,199,828 or
US-A-3,995,328. In a conventional portable toilet system, such as a portable
toilet structure commonly known as a PORTA-JOHN., the toilet seat is
mounted directly on top of a holding sump. Human waste drops directly into
the sump by means of gravity, where it is collected for subsequent purification
and treatment. While such toilet systems are simple in design, and easy to
install and operate at construction sites, roadside rest stops, popular outdoor
events, etc., they are frequently unsanitary and subject to offensive odors, 
and usually do not provide a wash sink. For a typical
person, they are used as a last resort.The airplane industry has long felt the need
for a more sanitary and appealing toilet system for its
aircraft, featuring a conventional toilet bowl and a
wash sink. Because of the ready source of vacuum
pressure provided by high altitude environments,
differential pressure has been used to operate such
systems instead of positive pressure provided by a
pump. Thus, U.S. Patent No. 3,922,730 issued to Kemper
discloses a recirculating toilet system for use in
aircraft or the like. Waste from the toilet bowl is
discharged along with a volume of water into a holding
sump having a screen positioned therein for separating
liquid from the solid elements of the waste stream by
means of gravity. While the solid fraction is removed
from the sump and therefore the aircraft by means of
the differential pressure caused by the reduced
pressure condition outside the aircraft, the liquid
fraction is chemically treated and then pumped back to
the toilet bowl for purposes of rinsing it during a
subsequent flush cycle. However, a simple diaphragm
actuated flapper is used as a discharge valve, and the
control means for regulating the discharge of the
contents of the toilet bowl to the holding sump and
ejection of rinse water into the toilet bowl are
completely electro-mechanical in nature (i.e., a
solenoid valve). A vacuum-operated portable toilet
system, such as that taught by Kemper, is complicated
in design, and its costs are justifiable only in terms
of the production and operational costs of the
aircraft, itself. U.S.
