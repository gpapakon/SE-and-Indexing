<ABSTRACT>
In known electromagnetically controllable valves the valve needle consists of a tubular armature section, a tubular valve sleeve section and a valve closing member section. The armature section is linked to the first end of the valve sleeve section by means of a first solder and the valve closing member section is linked to the other end of the valve sleeve section by means of a second solder. This production process is relatively expensive and costly because of the two soldering operations required. In a new valve needle (58), a tubular actuating part (31) consisting of an armature section (36) and of a valve sleeve section (38) is produced by injection moulding followed by sintering, according to the metal injection moulding process. The actuating part (32) is then linked to a valve closing member section (46) by means of a solder, so that the valve needle (58) can thus be produced in a simple and economical manner. This valve needle is particularly suitable for injection valves in fuel injection systems of internal combustion engines.

Valve needle for an electromagnetically actuated 
valve, in particular for an injection valve for fuel 

injection systems of internal combustion engines, which 
injection valve has a core (2), a solenoid coil (1) and 

a fixed valve seat (22) with which the valve needle (58) 
comprising an armature section (36), a valve sleeve 

section (38) and a valve-closing element section (46) 
interacts, the valve sleeve section (38) connecting the 

armature section (36) to the valve-closing element 
section (46) and a longitudinal opening (34) extending 

through the armature section (36) and the valve sleeve 
section (38), and the armature section (36), the valve 

sleeve section (38) and the valve-closing element section 
(46) of the valve needle (58) being manufactured as one 

part, characterized in that the armature section (36), 
valve sleeve section (38) and valve-closing element 

section (46) of the valve needle (58) are composed of 
sintered material and are manufactured according to the 

metal-injection-moulding method. 
Valve needle according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the valve sleeve section (38) tapers conically in 

the direction of the valve-closing element section (46) 
starting from the armature section (36). 
Valve needle according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that cut-outs (85) extending in the direction 

of a valve longitudinal axis (11) are made in the wall of 
the longitudinal opening (34) of the valve sleeve section 

(38). 
Method for manufacturing a valve needle designed 
according to one of Claims 1 to 3, which valve needle  

 
comprises an armature section (36), a valve-closing 

element section (46) and a valve sleeve section (38) 
which connects the armature section (36) to the valve-closing 

element section (46), the armature section (36), 
the valve sleeve section (38) and the valve-closing 

element section (46) being constructed as one part, 
characterized in that, in accordance with the metal-injection-moulding 

method, in a first method step a metal 
powder (61) and a binding agent (62) are mixed with one 

another and homogenized, in a second method step, by 
means of injection-moulding, a moulded part (66) comprising 

the armature section (36), the valve sleeve section 
(38) and the valve-closing element section (46) is 

manufactured, in a third method step the binding agent 
(62) is removed from the moulded part (66) and in a 

fourth method step the moulded part (66) is sintered. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that a plastic is used as binding agent. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the binding agent is removed from the moulded part 

(66) by means of a thermal treatment of this moulded part 
(66). 
Method according to Claims 4 to 6, characterized 
in that after the sintering the moulded part (66) is hot 

isostatically moulded.
