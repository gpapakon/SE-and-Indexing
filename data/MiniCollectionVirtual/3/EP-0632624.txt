<ABSTRACT>
Digital signal transmission system operating by coding of a constellation, the system comprising a unit (10) for modulation by multiplex distribution of orthogonal frequencies, called OFDM modulation, which generates OFDM signals (S1) and an amplifier (12) which causes signal distorsion. The system comprises a predistortion circuit (20) placed between the OFDM modulation unit and the amplifier, the said circuit predistorting the OFDM signals (S1), received as input, in a sense opposed to the distortions created by the amplifier, and generating predistorted OFDM signals (S2) such that, after they have passed through the amplifier, the latter delivers undistorted OFDM signals (S3). The system can operate in fixed mode or in adaptive mode. Application: digital transmissions.
