<ABSTRACT>
The composition of a refrigerant within the 
refrigeration cycle in which a non-azeotrope refrigerant 

is used is controlled to a predetermined composition. 
Further, the amount of the refrigerant is detected, and 

the composition and amount of the refrigerant within the 
refrigeration cycle are displayed, facilitating the 

maintenance of the refrigerant. The refrigeration cycle 
includes a compressor (1), a heat-source-side heat exchanger (2), 

use-side heat exchangers (20a,20b), and a pressure reducing 
apparatus (7,21a,21b), in which cycle a non-azeotrope refrigerant is 

used as a refrigerant. The refrigeration cycle further 
includes a sensor (8), disposed in a pipe portion where a 

liquid phase is formed, for detecting the composition of 
the non-azeotrope refrigerant circulating within the 

refrigeration cycle, and devices (5,6,10) for controlling the 
composition to a predetermined composition, a sensor for 

detecting the amount of refrigerant and a device for 
displaying the amount of the refrigerant. Since the 

composition of the refrigerant circulating within the 
refrigeration cycle is detected and control appropriate 

for the detected composition is performed, it becomes 
possible to perform a stable operation even when the 

refrigerant leaks outside and the composition of the 
refrigerant varies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of controlling the composition
of a refrigerant in a refrigeration cycle. First, a case in which a non-azeotrope
refrigerant is used as a working medium will be
explained. The non-azeotrope refrigerant is a
refrigerant in which two or more types of refrigerants
having different boiling points are mixed, and has
characteristics shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 is a vapor-liquid
equilibrium diagram illustrating characteristics
of a non-azeotrope refrigerant in which two types of
refrigerants are mixed. The horizontal axis indicates
the composition ratio X of a refrigerant having a low
boiling point, and the vertical axis indicates
temperature. With pressure as a parameter, a saturation
vapor line and a saturation liquid line exist in a high 
temperature region indicated by pressure PH when, for
example, pressure is high and when,conversely, pressure
is low, these lines exist in a low temperature region
indicated by pressure PL. The composition ratio X = 0
indicates that the refrigerant is formed of only a high-boiling-point
refrigerant, and the composition ratio X =
1.0 indicates that the refrigerant is formed of only a
low-boiling-point refrigerant. In a mixture refrigerant,
as shown in Fig. 3, a saturation liquid line and a
saturation vapor line are determined by the composition
thereof. The area below the saturation liquid line
indicates the supercooled state, and the area above the
saturation vapor line indicates the superheated state.
The portion surrounded by the saturation liquid line and
the saturation vapor line is a two-phase state of liquid
and vapor. In Fig. 3, X0 denotes the composition ratio of
a refrigerant sealed in a refrigeration cycle. Points P1
to P4 indicate the typical points of the refrigeration
cycle, and point P1 indicates a compressor outlet
portion; point P2 indicates a condenser outlet portion;
point P3 indicates an evaporator inlet portion; and point
P4 indicates a compressor inlet portion.An explanation will be given below of problems
relating to leakage out of the refrigeration cycle, to
variations in the composition of a circulating
refrigerant within the refrigeration cycle in a non-steady
state such as at the start-up time of the 
refrigeration cycle, and to refrigeration cycle operation
control.The leakage of a refrigerant out of the
refrigeration cycle is not none even in a hermetically
sealed type air-conditioner or refrigerator. In Fig. 3,
point A indicates the two-phase portion in the
refrigeration cycle, in which the liquid of composition

<CLAIMS>
A method of sealing in a non-azeotrope refrigerant and controlling the composition of the refrigerant
in a refrigeration cycle comprising a compressor (1); a

heat-source-side heat exchanger (2); a use-side heat
exchanger (20a, 20b); and a refrigerant pressure reducing

apparatus (7),
said method comprising the steps of:


evacuating the refrigeration cycle to a vacuum by a
vacuum pump before a non-azeotrope refrigerant is sealed

in, and
sealing in refrigerants which form said non-azeotrope
refrigerant according to the descending order of their

boiling points, each by a predetermined amount.
A method according to claim 1 comprising the step of
decreasing the pressure on a low pressure side of the

refrigeration cycle less than the saturation pressure of a
high-boiling-point refrigerant and sealing in a high-boiling-point

refrigerant when a refrigerant is added to
the refrigeration cycle on the basis of the type and

amount of the refrigerant to be added, displayed on a
display apparatus for displaying the type and amount of

the refrigerant.
