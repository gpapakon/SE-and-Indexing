<ABSTRACT>
Improved time-division multiplexed 
communication methods for a wide area paging system. 

One method appends check bits of a correction code to 
each data word and interleaves the words on 

transmission. A second method transmits multiple 
messages for one or more paging receivers in a single 

time slot. A third method increases the number of 
individual receivers that can be served by a singl
e 
paging system. A fourth method increases the number of 

receivers that can be served by splitting the receivers 
in an area among several systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems 
and receivers and more particularly to wide area paging 
systems and portable paging receivers with low power 
consumption and method of data transmission to many 
receivers on a common channel. Prior paging systems generally provide two 
categories of coverage. Local area coverage is 
typically provided by transmitting a page simultaneously 
from one or more transmitters operating on a single 
frequency, covering all or a portion of a metropolitan 
area, to a recipient within the local area. Such 
coverage is obviously limited to the broadcast range of 
a local transmitter. Wide area coverage, encompassing 
several overlapping areas of a large metropolitan area 
or a number of non-overlapping metropolitan areas, is 
typically provided by transmitting a paging request to 
several transmitters via telecommunications and 
broadcasting the paging message from all transmitters to 
an intended recipient who may be anywhere within the 
wide coverage area. The foregoing approach to providing 
a wide area coverage is expensive and limited to a 
relatively small number of paging users. As paging 
traffic increases, the local and wide area coverage 
users begin to compete for paging channel space. Each 
wide area user occupies a portion of the available  
 
paging channel space for all of the page transmitters 
within the wide coverage area, displacing local coverage 
users of the same channel portion from each 
transmitter. It would be preferable to be able to 
provide wide area paging coverage without displacing 
local area coverage users of the same channel portion 
from all transmitters in the wide area. Another problem with present paging systems is 
their incompatibility. Local area coverage users may 
use one type of paging message encoding scheme for 
broadcasting a page to a page receiver and wide area 
coverage users may use a second type. A user who 
travels frequently must carry different page receivers 
to receive both types of messages. One solution to the 
incompatibility is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,518,961 
to Davis et al. Davis et al. describes a single page 
receiver that stores the encoding schemes for a number 
of paging systems, encoding schemes such as POCSAG, the 
paging protocol for the British Post Office, and GGC, a 
paging protocol designed by Motorola, Inc. This is only 
a partial solution, however, because the number of 
encoding schemes greatly exceeds the number the Davis et 
al. receiver can store. Prior paging systems have also
