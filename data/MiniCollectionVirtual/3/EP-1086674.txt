<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser treatment apparatus
for irradiating an affected part of a patient with a treatment
laser beam to treat the affected part.There have been used laser treatment apparatus such as a
photocoagulation device for irradiating an affected part of an
eye fundus of a patient with a treatment laser beam (hereinafter
simply referred to as a treatment beam) to coagulate the affected
part by heat for treatment. In irradiation of the treatment beam
to the eye fundus, such the apparatus is operated by an operator,
who observes the patient's eye with a slit lamp, to perform
sighting (aiming) of the treatment beam to a desired site on the
affected part by utilizing an aiming laser beam (hereinafter
simply referred to as an aiming beam) made coaxial with the
treatment beam. When the aiming beam and the treatment beam are
different in color (wavelength), which causes refraction and
dispersion differences based on the wavelength differences, the
difference may possibly occur in reaching conditions to the eye
fundus between the beams of different colors (wavelengths). For
preventing this problem, it is preferable to use the aiming beam
of the same color as the color of the treatment beam.In the laser treatment apparatus, normally, a protective
filter is interposed in an optical path for observation in the
slit lamp in order to cut or intercept the treatment beam reflected
by the patient's eye and others to protect the eyes of an operator   
during the treatment beam irradiation. Accordingly, if the
aiming beam of the same color as that of the treatment beam is
used, the aiming beam is also cut or intercepted by the protective
filter, so that the aiming beam becomes invisible. As a result,
the irradiation site of the aiming beam, namely, of the treatment
beam could not be visually recognized by the operator during the
treatment beam irradiation.EP 0 624 422 A2 discloses a laser apparatus using an invisible
beam for treatment and using a visible beam for aiming to
check an irradiation position of the treatment beam. For example,
a red aiming beam is irradiated when the treatment beam
is ON and a green aiming beam is irradiated when the treatment
beam is OFF, and the apparatus informs a user of the ON/OFF
status of the invisible treatment beam.EP 0 356 282 A1 discloses a laser apparatus using a visible
beam for treatment, provided with a treatment beam source
which can be weakened
to be used as aiming beam prior to treatment.The present invention has been made in view of the above
circumst
