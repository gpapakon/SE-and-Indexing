<ABSTRACT>
A support (carrier, substrate) material in the form of a web for a thermosensitive recording layer having a surface of high smoothness or extremely low roughness and carrying a coating containing colourless reactants, such as dye precursors, which cause a colour-change reaction on exposure to heat, contains at least one watermark (2) in the support material (1).

Web-shaped recording material comprising a carrier (1) of paper, which 
carrier exhibits a marking and is provided with a coating of a colourless colour 

precursor compound which reacts under action of heat, characterised in that 
said marking is a water mark (2) which can be applied below the coating in the 

carrier (1) and which is designed to serve as a sign of quality. 
Web-shaped recording material according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the carrier (1) is a machine-finished paper having a well-closed sur
face. 
Web-shaped recording material according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the paper has an area-related mass of 40 - 250 g/m
2
, preferably 
50 - 150 g/m
2
. 
Web-shaped recording material according to one or more of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that, from case to case, the paper is of intense whiteness or 

of comparatively less intense whiteness, and is of a colour only insignificantly 
impairing the transmission of light. 
Web-shaped recording material according to one or more of claims 1 - 4, 
characterised in that the paper is made of bleached, semibleached or 

unbleached pulp. 
Web-shaped recording material according to one or more of claims 1 - 5, 
characterised in that the paper is manufactured of waste paper.
