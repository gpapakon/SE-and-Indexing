<ABSTRACT>
A process allows even laymen to automatically print a desired pattern on fashionable accessories such as ties, scarves and the like and to finish them in a simple and rapid manner. For that purpose, a pattern to be printed is produced by means of a data processing system (10) and of a working programme stored therein and is stored as a pattern printing programme. The pattern to be printed is printed on a prepared blank (22) made of a textile material or the like by means of a programme-controlled colour printer (14) and the desired product (18) is shaped out of the printed material blank.
