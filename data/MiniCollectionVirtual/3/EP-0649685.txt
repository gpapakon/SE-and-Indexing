<DESCRIPTION>
The
present invention refers to a device for processing the
return of unsold articles, which provides a series of
relevant and advantageous characteristics in this
industrial sector.The device that constitutes the object of the present
invention is conceived as the area or platform for
processing articles of a varied nature and shapes (boxes of
stickers, chewing gum, trifles, big promotional cartons
with recorded videos and tapes, newspapers, magazines,
etc.) which is used peripherally with regard to a machine
that identifies and classifies exclusively capable of
processing publications such as magazines, newspapers and
the like; machine whose classic example of use is by
distributors of periodic publications, to control the
payment of the unsold copies which are returned to it at
regular intervals by the retailers.Basically, the object of this device now proposed is
to facilitate the precise, continuous and synchronized
control of all the unsold articles, producing a true
automatized industrial management process in which human
decisions are minimal, and the manpower is optimized.These machines preferably handle flat objects such as
magazines and the like, for classification thereof which
may or may not be preceded by identification of their
printed covers or associated code.Although it may be used in a more general manner, the
object of the present invention is particularly destined to
improve the effectiveness and functional reliability of a
machine that identifies and classifies a huge amount of
unsold press that has to be processed to return them to the
distributor or publishing firm equipped with such a 
machine. DE-A-4215101 discloses a system for processing
the return of unsold articles, including a machine for
recognition and classification of unsold articles (such as
publications) which includes a loading area, an identification
station (including a barcode-scanner) and a
system for conveying articles, comprising movable containers
from which the articles are dropped into specific
boxes in accordance with a classification schedule. The
system includes a computer for introducing the code of the
client who returns the articles.US-A-3181685 describes a system primarily
intended for post offices, which includes a plurality of
subsequent conveyors defining a primary path along which
parcels are conveyed from a first station where an operator
orients the parcels in an appropriate manner and past a
second station where another operator inputs a code corresponding
to the address of the parcel. Said
