<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous silicone coating composition containing a reactive 
siloxane polymer and a non-reactive dimethylpolysiloxane in 

an aqueous carrier having an effective amount of at least one 
dispersing agent to disperse the siloxanes throughout the 

aqueous carrier. Also provided is a method of lubricating 
substrates by applying an aqueous silicone coating 

composition to the substrate and curing the silicone thereon, 
as well as lubricated surgical needles prepared by that 

method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to an aqueous silicone
coating composition for providing lubricity to
substrates, such as suture needles, hypodermic needles
or razor blades. The invention is also directed to a
method of coating such substrates with an aqueous
silicone composition and the coated surgical needles
produced thereby.Silicone compositions have been used to coat, and thus
provide lubricity to, various articles of manufacture.
The prior art describes coating articles having fine
cutting edges with copolymers of methylsiloxane and
aminoalkylsiloxane. This reference discloses applying
the copolymer through the use of an inert solvent
carrier, such as isopropyl alcohol, toluene or benzene.Also, the prior art discloses the use of a film-forming
composition, comprising three different reactive
siloxane polymers and a non-reactive lubricating
siloxane polymer, that is applied and used on a
substrate, such as a hypodermic needle, to increase the 
lubricity of that substrate. The film-forming siloxane
compositions of these references are applied to the
desired substrate by using an inert, organic solvent
carrier, such as a chlorofluorocarbon (e.g., those
materials known by the trademark Freon®, DuPont Co.,
DE, USA).The prior art further describes a coated surgical
needle prepared by applying to a surgical needle a
curable silicone composition comprising an aminoalkyl
siloxane and at least one other copolymerizable
siloxane. A mixture of dimethyl cyclosiloxane and
dimethoxysilyldimethylamino-ethylaminopropyl silicone
polymer is disclosed as the preferred silicone
composition. This reference teaches that the silicone
composition is applied to the surgical needle as a
solution in an organic solvent such as hexane,
trichlorotrifluoroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane or
mineral spirits.Still further, the prior art discloses a method of
coating a suture needle by depositing a silicone
solution containing a silicone and a solvent on the
needle. The solution-coated needle is subsequently
exposed to a gas atmosphere to form a layer of silicon
adjacent and adhered to the outer surface of the
needle. The remaining unadhered silicon is removed
from the needle with a solvent. The reference teaches
polydimethylsiloxane as an exemplary silicone, while
acetone, a Freon® chlorofluorocarbon, trichloroethane
or methylene chloride are mentioned as exemplary
solvents.Prior to this time, silicon coating solutions used to
impart lubricity to various articles of manufacture,
such as suture needles and razor blades, have required
the
