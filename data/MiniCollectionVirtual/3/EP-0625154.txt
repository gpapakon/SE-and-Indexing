<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing 2-amino-6-chloropurine comprises reacting a 2,9-diacylated derivative of guanine with a chlorinating agent in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst containing chloride ions, and thereafter removing the 9-acyl group and the 2-acyl group by hydrolysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Preparation of 2-am1 no-6-chloropurineThis invention relates to a process for the preparation of a compound useful as an intermediate in the preparation of pharmaceutical compounds.The compound 2-amino-6-chloropurine of formula (I):
 (I)is a useful intermediate in the preparation of nucleoside analogue antiviral agents, such as penciclovir and famciclovir, described in EP-A-141927 (Example 1) and EP-A-182024 (Example 2). The intermediate is 9-substituted with an appropriate side chain precursor, followed by conversion of the 6-chloro moiety to a hydroxy (a guanine) or hydrogen (a 2-aminopurine).EP-A-203685 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) describes a process for preparing a compound of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined, which process comprises reacting guanine with a chlorinating agent in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst containing chloride ions. EP-A-433846 (Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft) describes a corresponding process for preparing the 2-acylated derivative, involving chlorination of 2,9-diacylguanine and subsequent removal of the 9- acyl group by hydrolysis.The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar inert organic solvent such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, nitromethane, diglyme, dimethoxyethane, ordichloromethane. Acetonitrile is highly preferred. 

Suitable phase transfer catalysts include tetrasubstituted ammonium chlorides. Examples of ammonium substituents include C2-12 aik i, usually C2-4 alkyl, or phenyl or benzyl. Other possible phase transfer catalysts include tetra-substituted phosphonium chlorides wherein examples of the substitutents are as defined above for ammonium chlorides. Preferably the phase transfer catalyst is tetraethylammonium chloride.The phase-transfer catalyst is preferably present in an amount of from 1 to 3 equivalents of the compound of formula (II) and preferably from 1 to 2 equivalents.A preferred chlorinating agent is phosphorus oxychloride.Preferably the chlorinating agent is present in an amount of from 2-10 preferably from 3-6 molar equivalents of the guanine derivative.The reaction may be effected in the presence of a weak base, such as a tertiary amine, for example N,N-dimethylaniliÏ€e or diethylaniline or triethylamine- The base is usually present in an approximately molar equivalent amount with respect to the guanine derivative. Alternatively, a catalytic amount of water may be added to the reaction mixture. When acetonitrile is the solvent, added base may not be necessary, but is preferred.The reaction is preferably carried out at an elevated
