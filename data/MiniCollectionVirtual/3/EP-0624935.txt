<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (14) is adapted for 
mounting on a surface (52) of a printed circuit board (44). 

The connector includes a dielectric housing (2A) mounting 
electrical terminals (20), with the housing being adapted 

for mounting on the surface of the board and the terminals 
establishing electrical connection to appropriate circuit 

means on the board. A hold-down clip (26) is mounted on 
the housing and includes a leg portion (30) projecting 

through a hole in the board with a hooked latch (28c) for 
engaging an opposite side of the board to secure the 

connector to the board. The hold-down clip is configured 
such that the leg portion is spring loaded to bias the 

hooked latch against the opposite side of the board and 
thereby accommodate printed circuit boards of varying 

thicknesses. A method of using such hold-down clip is also 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a hold-down 
clip for an electrical connector mounted on a surface of a 
printed circuit board, and including means for 
accommodating boards having varying thicknesses. Surface-mounted electrical connectors most often 
have some form of hold-down means for securing the 
connector to a surface of a printed circuit board or the 
like. The hold-down means may be provided for permanent 
securement of the connector or for temporarily maintaining 
the connector during reflow or wave soldering procedures 
for permanently interconnecting terminals of the connector 
with circuit traces on the board. Such hold-down means may 
be provided by mounting pegs which are integral with the 
connector housing or by separate hold-down devices or 
clips. For example, a typical arrangement is known from document DE-C-4.125.823. The mounting 
pegs or clips are provided with a bifurcated configuration, along with 
outwardly projecting hooks or barbs for engaging the 
opposite surface of the printed circuit board, whereby the 
pegs or clips can be yieldingly inserted through holes in 
the board and snappingly engage the opposite side of the 
board to hold the connector onto the one surface of the 
board. One of the problems with hold-down means of the 
character described above, is associated with the fact that 
the thickness of a given circuit board may vary, if for no  
 
other reason than simple manufacturing tolerances. 
Consequently, although the electrical connector may be held 
onto the surface of the printed circuit board, if the board 
is too thin, the securement may not be sufficiently tight 
to maintain reliable interengagement between the terminals 
means of the connector and the circuit traces or solder 
pads of the printed circuit board which, in turn, will 
result in unreliable solder connections. In other words, 
during a reflow or wave soldering process, it is desirable 
to have the terminal means of the connector to be in steady 
engagement with the solder pads of the printed circuit 
board. If a loose securement of the connector with the 
board is effected by the particular hold-down means, these 
electrical interconnections often are unreliable or, in 
fact, defective. In the alternative, the solder joints may 
initially be reliable, but subsequently fail due to 
stresses incurred because the hold-down means did not 
securely hold the connector to the board. Prior art mounting pegs which are integral with

and to bias said latch means against the opposite side of 
the board and thereby accommodate printed circuit boards of 

varying thicknesses, wherein said bight portion
