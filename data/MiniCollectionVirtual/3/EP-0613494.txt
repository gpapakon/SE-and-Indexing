<ABSTRACT>
Base hydrocarbon liquid, preferably dimethylmethane (propane), is fortified with 4 % to 10 % of a mixture of methylethylketone plus C4 H10 O or C4 H10 O2 group hydrocarbons plus activated carbon as a catalyst to make an azeotropic mixture. Better performance of a motor vehicle and lower emissions can be obtained. Under water cutting can be performed with as little as 95 % oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Liquified Fuel Gas and Process for Making and Using the SameTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to fuel gas used as a torch fuel for cutting and/or welding also as an automotive fuel, the combustion qualities altered by the use of additives.Background ArtVarious formulations in the market place are non composed of methacetylene, plus propadiene, plus propane. Also used are propylene and bytane or bytane.Ather groups use propane with methanol additive.These mixtures are primarily methanical in that each component retains its own boiling point.All of these liguified fuel gasses were designed to be a replace ment for acetylene which is a gas dissolued in acetone with in a media.A liquified fuel gas occupies almost one fifthi the vocume of a dissolued gas making the cost of shipping and handling lower. Liquified fuel gasses can be used at higaer operating pressures and their cost is generally lower.Disclosure of the Invention.The principal objects of this invention are to provide a liquified fuel gas which has a higher flameSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

temperature, a faster rate of burning and lower emission of pollutants.A particular object is to make available any where in the world that liquified petroleum gas [LPG] is found a means of making a superior cutting and / or welding gas and motor fuel.A further object is to provide a liquified fuel gas which can be stored and transported easily and economicaly. It is also an object to provide a liquified fuel gas which when burned with oxygen for flame cutting of ferrous metals will produce a cleaner, faster cutt with no objectionable slag or scoria formation. Another object is to provide an automotive motor fuel which has enhanced performance and lower emissions of sucpher dioxide, carbon dioxide and nitric oxides. An additional object is to provide a liquified fuel gas that can be used by torches for cutting underwater at considerable depths. The foregoing objects can be accompcished by reformu eating di-methyl methane [propane] with other hydro carbons which act as promoters and octane boosters.Best modes for carrying out the Invention. Liquified propane [Di-Methyl Methane] which has been dehydrated and de-sucferized is the preffered base in gredient for the liquified fuel gas of the present invention because of its high heat content, low costSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

and world wide availability.The first additive orfortifier used is methylethyl ketone, also known as z- butanone, having the formula CH3 C0CH2 CH3 . This additive is a liquid with a boilig point of
