<ABSTRACT>
A mobile switching center of this invention includes 
a public network interface, a communication signal processing 

unit for performing code translation, a packet switching 
unit for performing switching of a packet signal between the 

communication signal processing unit and a radio base 
station in accordance with the destination of the packet 

signal, and a packet signal selecting apparatus. The packet 
signal selecting apparatus (100) includes one input terminal (106), a 

plurality of signal storage sections (101, 102) for respectively 
storing a plurality of packet signals input through the 

input terminal, a switching means for distributing a 
plurality of continuously input packet signals to the 

plurality of signal storage sections and causing them to 
respectively store the signals, and a discrimination unit 

for comparing some or all of the packet signals stored in 
all the signal storage sections with each other to select 

one packet signal, and outputting the selected packet 
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packet signal 
selecting apparatus for selecting one of a plurality of 
packet signals respectively transmitted through a plurality 
of communication paths in a mobile communication system, and 
a mobile switching center including the apparatus and 
realizing macro-diversity. A conventional mobile communication system for 
vehicle telephone sets and portable telephone sets uses a 
small zone scheme of covering the entire service area of a 
mobile communication system with radio zones at a plurality 
of locations. In this case, a radio zone is a range in 
which each radio base station performs communication between 
mobile units mounted in vehicles through radio channels. 
One radio base station is installed in one radio zone, and 
a plurality of mobile units freely move between the respective 
zones. Each radio base station can use a plurality of 
radio channels and determines a radio channel to be used on 
the basis of a radio wave propagation environment between 
mobile units between which communication is to be performed. 
In addition, if the radio wave propagation environment for  
 
a radio channel in use deteriorates during communication, 
another radio channel is used. This operation is called a 
"channel switching during voice communication" (handover). 
A mobile switching center is an apparatus for controlling 
these radio base stations and performing channel switching 
with respect to a fixed telephone network. As shown in Fig. 1, in a digital mobile communication 
system (Nakajima et al., "Digital Mobile Communication 
System Plan" in B-317 of Proceedings of the 1991 IEICE 
Spring Conference, and Ishino et al., "Mobile Communication 
Switching System for Voice/Nonvoice Services", IEEE 
GLOBECOM' 91, pp. 1485 - 1489), a mobile switching center 1 
is constituted by a mobile switching unit 3 accommodating a 
nonvoice/ISDN adaptor 2, voice processing units 4 and 5, and 
a triple connection trunk 6. A radio base station 10 is 
constituted by modulation/demodulation units 11 and 12, a 
control unit 13, and common amplifiers 14 and 15. The voice 
processing units 4 and 5 are signal compressors each 
constituted by a CODEC and the like. Channels between the mobile switching center 1 and 
the radio base station 10 are designed as follows. As for 
a transmission path 18 for control signals, in order to 
improve the reliability, 64-kbps channels are duplexed. As 
for a transmission path 19 for voice signals, 11.2-kbps 
voice signals output from the voice processing
