<ABSTRACT>
A tennis racket has longitudinal strings (G1') 
stretched in a longitudinal direction between a frame top 

and a grid end and transversal strings (G2') stretched in a 
transversal direction perpendicular to the longitudinal 

direction, and a ratio of a tensile force exerted on each 
longitudinal string to a tensile force exerted on each 

transversal string ranges from 2.5 : 1 to 4.0 : 1 so that a 
nodal line (ND2') for vibrations in the secondary mode 

passes through a sweet area, thereby decreasing a reaction 
from the tennis racket at an impact against a tennis ball.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tennis racket and, more 
particularly, to a tennis racket having longitudinal 
strings strongly stretched rather than transversal strings. A typical example of the tennis racket is disclosed 
in U.S. Patent No. 3,999,756, and the prior art tennis 
racket achieves a wide sweet spot. However, the inventor 
states that the these desirable features are attained 
without resort of weights, strings or the complications but 
instead are attained by increasing the size of the head 
primarily in the direction of the mid-point of the racket. 
Therefore, the prior art tennis racket disclosed in the 
U.S. Patent exerts the tensile force equally on the 
longitudinal strings and the transversal strings. Another prior art tennis racket is disclosed in 
U.S.P. 4,768,786, and the prior art tennis racket, and the 
prior art tennis racket matches the vibrations produced 
thereon with the vibrations of a tennis ball at the impact 
for a strong rebounded ball. However, the U.S. Patent is 
silent to the tensile force exerted on the vertical strings  
 
and to the transversal strings. Since the tensile force on 
the vertical strings and the tensile force on the 
transversal strings are usually regulated in a ratio of 
1:1, the prior art tennis racket disclosed in the U.S. 
patent is considered to equally exert the same tensile 
force on both longitudinal and transversal strings. Thus, the prior art tennis rackets stretch the 
vertical strings and the transversal strings under the same 
tensile force. One of the problems inherent in the prior art tennis 
rackets is encountered in long use in that players are 
liable to have damages in the elbows due to the reaction at 
the impact against the tennis ball. The damages are called 
as "tennis elbow". When a player hits a tennis ball at the 
sweet spot or the sweet area, the player feels a week 
shock, and the prior art tennis racket disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 3,999,756 can decrease the shock at the impact. 
However, even if a player continues to exactly hit a tennis 
ball at the sweet area, the player suffers from the tennis 
elbow in a long period of time. The manufacturers have taken two approaches against 
the damages. One the approaches is to add a damping weight 
member to the tennis racket, and the damping weight member  
 
aims at rapid attenuation of the vibrations produced in the 
racket frame upon impact of the tennis ball. The damping 
weight member is fairly effective against the vibrations. 
However, the damping weight member can not

A tennis racket comprising 

a) a racket frame (101) having a shaft portion (103; 
204) for allowing a player to grip on a grip end (106) 

thereof and a head portion (102; 202) merged into said head 
portion and allowing a strung surface (104; 203) to be 

stretched thereover, said head portion having a top end 
(107) opposite to said grip end,characterized in that 

   said racket frame allows a first nodal line (ND2') of 
vibrations in a secondary mode to pass through a sweet area 

(in the vicinity of SW') in said strung surface upon an 
impact against a standard tennis ball. 
The tennis racket as set forth in claim 1, in which 
further comprising 


b) longitudinal strings (G1'; 108) stretched over said 
head portion in a longitudinal direction parallel to 

virtual line between said top end and said grip end; and 
c) transversal strings (G2'; 109) stretched over said 
head portion in a transversal direction substantially 

perpendicular to said longitudinal direction for forming 
said strung surface together with said longitudinal 

strings, a ratio of a first tensile force exerted on each 
longitudinal string to a second tensile force exerted on 

 
each transversal string ranging from 2.5 : 1 to 4.0 : 1.

said head portion (102) has a width (w) varied in 

proportional to a strain (D1) produced therein due to said 
longitudinal strings and said vertical strings.

said racket frame (101) has a rigidity equal to or greater 

than 330 N/ mm against a compressive force in said 
longitudinal direction. 
The tennis racket as set forth in claim 3, in which 
said racket frame (101) has a first rigidity equal to or 

greater than 330 N/mm against a compressive force in said 
longitudinal direction and a second rigidity equal to or 

greater than 60 N/ mm against a compressive force in said 
transversal direction. 
The tennis racket as set forth in claim 2, in which 
said head portion (202) is substantially uniform in width 

and formed from frame pieces (202a/ 202b/ 202c/ 202d) 
different in rigidity, said frame pieces being arranged in 

such a manner that the rigidity of said head portion is 
varied in proportional to a strain (D1) produced therein

said racket frame (102/ 103) has a rigidity equal to or 

greater than 330 N/ mm against a compressive force in said 
longitudinal direction. 
The tennis racket as set forth in claim 6, in which
