<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of pharmaceutical
chemistry and provides a process for preparing 2,2-difluoroketene
silyl acetals useful as pharmaceutical
intermediates and a process for employing these acetals in the
preparation of α,α-difluoro-β-silyloxy-1,3-dioxolane-4-propanoic
acid ester intermediates.Ketene silyl acetals were first prepared by Petrov, et
al.; see J. Gen. Chem. (USSR), 29, 2896-99 (1959). H. Greuter,
et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 29 (27), 3291-94 (1988) teach the use
of allylic esters of chlorodifluoroacetic acid in silicon
induced Reformatsky-Claisen reactions in which 2,2-difluoroketene
silyl acetals are the inferred intermediates. M.
Yamana, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 24 (5), 507-10 (1983) and Y.
Takeuchi, et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1149-53 (1988)
teach the preparation of difluoro silyl enol ethers on reaction
of chlorodifluoromethyl ketones with zinc dust and
trimethylsilyl chloride.2,2-Difluoroketene silyl acetals have been prepared
from the direct reaction of bromodifluoroacetate esters, zinc
amalgam and chlorotrimethyl silane in triglyme; see J. C.
Easdon, New Synthetic Methodology for Organofluorine Compounds,
Ph.D. Thesis, Chemistry Department, Graduate College of the
University of Iowa, July 1987. Kobayashi, et al. in Japanese
Patent 2,067,250 and Tetrahedron Lett., 29 (15), 1803-06 (1988)
describe the preparation of 2,2-difluoroketene silyl acetals by
reacting methyl iododifluoroacetate with zinc dust in
acetonitrile and treating the resultant organozinc species
(Reformatsky reagent) with trialkylsilyl chloride. They further
disclose the preparation of α,α-difluoro-2,2-dimethyl-β-[(trialkylsilyl)oxy]-1,3-dioxolane-4-propanoic
acid methyl
esters from the reaction of 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde
with the in situ-generated difluoroketene silyl
acetals. The 2,2-difluoroketene silyl acetals proved to be
superior to the corresponding Reformatsky reagents in that they 
afforded much higher erythro/threo (anti/syn) ratios in the
condensation reaction with 2,3-O-isopropylidene glyceraldehyde
than the latter reagents.The Journal of the Chemical Society Perkin
Transactions 1, 1988, pages 1149-1153, Takeuchi, Y.
et al, discloses a use of a similar starting material as
the present invention; however, no specific solvent is
disclosed in this reference.Matsumura, et al., in Japanese Patent 2,270,841,
described the preparation of anti-α,α-difluoro-2,2-dimethyl-β-[(trialkylsilyl)oxy]-1,3-dioxolane-4-propanoic
acid esters from
the reaction of bromodifluoroacetate
