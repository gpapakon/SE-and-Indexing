<ABSTRACT>
A pair of body components (3,4) are connected together in a closed position to define an internal cavity (5) through which a tubular catheter (2) or other component may pass and be securely enclosed. The components are movable to an open position in which they are spaced from each other to allow insertion or removal of the catheter. A clip (7) is incorporated in each component for attachment to a human body surface. The two components may be semi-cylindrical and approximately identical, and are connected to each other by a hinge or similar joint. Their internal walls, which define the internal cavity in the closed position, are coated with a layer of elastic material preventing tearing or slipping of the catheter.

<CLAIMS>
A device for protection and holding means of communications (2, 22)
between the inside of a patient's body with the outside, whereas the said device

comprises the means of communications and contains at least two elements (3, 4; 23,
24) delineating a closed position of the device in which the said elements are

interlocked and define a cavity (5, 27) for the passage of the said means (2, 22) and an
open position in which the said elements (3, 4; 23, 24) are at a distance from one

another in order to open the cavity and enable lateral retraction and placement of the
said device on the said means of communications, whereas the said device comprises

at least one protruding part (6, 25, 26) attached to the said elements, whereby the
protruding part forms a plane that is more or less perpendicular to the axis of the cavity,

whereas the means of communications are probes or drains, characterised in that the
elements (3, 4; 23, 24) are separable and in that they comprise means (8, 31) enabling

one element (4, 24) to slide into the other (3, 23), in that in the closed position, the
cavity delineated by the said elements exhibits an inside diameter corresponding more

or less to the outside diameter of the said means to hold them, whereas the said
elements (3, 4; 23, 24) cover totally the portion of the said means of communications

located inside the cavity (5, 27) and can hold them inside the said device.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that it consists of two
elements (3, 4; 23, 24) more or less semi-cylindrical.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the elements (3, 4; 23,
24) delineate a cavity suited to the shape of the means of communications.
A device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
inside wall of the cavity (5; 27) is covered with an elastic and antiskid material.
A device according to one of the claims 1 to 4, in which at least one part
(93, 94) made of a rigid material is placed on the inside wall of the cavity (5, 27).
A device according to any of the previous claims, characterised in that the

said protruding part (6; 25, 26) is made of a rigid material. 
A device according to any of the previous claims, characterised in that the
said protruding part comprises a part (28) made of an absorbing material, preferably

attached to a rigid part (25, 26).
A device according to any of the previous claims, characterised in that it
comprises means for attachment (7) onto the said body.
A device according to any of the claims 1 to 7, characterised in that it
comprises attachment means made of an adhesive zone placed on the rear face (29,

30).
A device according to any of the previous claims, in which the parts in
contact with the body are covered with an eschar-preventing material.
A device according to any of the previous claims, characterised in that it is
a single-use item.
