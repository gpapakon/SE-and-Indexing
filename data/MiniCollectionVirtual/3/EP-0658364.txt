<ABSTRACT>
Pressure swing adsorption air and other gas 
separation operations are carried out using specific 

preferred zeolite adsorbent compositions based on the 
symmetry of the framework atoms and cations therein. 

Specific SiO₂/Al₂O₃ and cation/cation ratios for 
enhanced performance are identified. LiX adsorbent 

having a silica to alumina ratio on the order of 2.364 
provides enhanced PSA performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention - The invention relates to
gas separation operations. More particularly, it
relates to enhanced air and other gas separation
operations using preferred zeolitic adsorbents.Description of the Prior Art - For a wide variety
of commercial applications in which cryogenic air
separation plants may not be economically feasible,
pressure swing adsorption (PSA) systems are
particularly suitable. For example, PSA systems have
been used to supply high purity oxygen for various
applications, such as chemical processing, steel mills,
paper mills, and lead and gas production operations.In PSA processing, a feed gas mixture, such as
air, containing a more readily adsorbable component and
a less readily adsorbable component, e.g., the nitrogen
and oxygen components of air, is passed to the feed end
of an adsorbent bed capable of selectively adsorbing
the more readily adsorbable component at an upper
adsorption pressure. The less readily adsorbable
component, e.g., oxygen, passes through the bed and is
recovered from the discharge end of the bed.
Thereafter, the bed is depressurized to a lower
desorption pressure for desorption of the more readily
adsorbable component, and its removal from the feed end
of the bed prior to the introduction of additional
quantities of the feed gas mixture for repressurization
of the bed and adsorption of the more readily
adsorbable component as cyclic adsorption -desorption-repressurization
operations are continued in the bed.Such PSA processing is commonly carried out in
multi-bed adsorption systems, with each bed employing 
the PSA processing sequence on a cyclic basis
interrelated to the carrying out of the processing
sequence in the other beds of the adsorption system.
In PSA systems for the recovery of high purity oxygen
product as the less readily adsorbable component of
air, each adsorbent bed will commonly contain an
adsorbent material capable of selectively adsorbing
nitrogen as the more readily adsorbable component, with
the selectively adsorbed nitrogen being subsequently
desorbed and recovered from the feed end of the bed
upon reduction of the pressure of the bed from the
upper adsorption pressure to a lower desorption
pressure level. PSA systems for the recovery of
nitrogen product have likewise been based on the use of
adsorbents that selectively adsorb nitrogen from air as
the more readily adsorbable component thereof, although
other PSA-nitrogen processes are based on the use of
oxygen-selective adsorbents, such as various carbon
adsorbent
