<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cytokine receptors and more 
specifically relates to Interleukin-12 receptors. In order for a molecule such as IL-12 to exert its effect on cells, it 
is now accepted by those skilled in the art that the molecule must 
interact with molecules, located on cell membranes, referred to as 
receptors. Patents which exemplify disclosures of interleukin receptors 
include Honjo et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,565; Urdal et al., U.S. Patent 
No. 4,578,335; Dower et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,180,812; and Taniguchi et 
al., U.S. Patent No. 5,198,359. Also soluble forms of interleukin receptors are known (Fanslow, 
W.C. et al. (1990) Science 248, 739-41). The effect of Interleukin-1 
(IL-1) in vivo could be regulated via the administration of a soluble 
form of its receptor. The results that Fanslow report demonstrate the 
ability of a soluble cytokine receptor (soluble IL-1R) to modulate 
biological activity upon exogeneous administration in vivo, 
presumably by acting as a neutralizing agent for the endogeneously 
produced, corresponding ligand (IL-1), and provides evidence of the 
therapeutic potential of soluble cytokine receptors in a variety of 
clinical disorders. Systemic administration of a soluble, extracellular 
portion of the receptor for IL-1 (soluble IL-1R) had profound 
inhibitory effects on the development of in vivo alloreactivity. 
Survival of heterotopic heart allografts was prolonged from 12 days in 
controls to 17 days in mice treated with soluble IL-1R. Lymph node 
hyperplasia in response to localized injection of allogeneic cells was 
completely blocked by soluble IL-1R treatment. Interleukin-12 (IL-12), formerly known as cytotoxic 
lymphocyte maturation factor or natural killer cell stimulatory 
factor, is a 75-KDa heterodimeric cytokine composed of disulfide-bonded 
40-KDa (p40) and 35-KDa (p35) subunits that has  
 
pleiotropic activities including stimulation of the proliferation of 
activated T and NK cells (Gately, M. K., et al. (1991) J. Immunol., 147, 
874) (Kobayashi, M. et al. (1989) J. Exp. Med., 170, 827), enhancement 
of the lytic activity of NK/LAK cells (Kobayashi, M., et al., supra; Stern, 
A.S., et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, 6808), enhancement 
of cytolytic T-cell responses (M. Gately et al. (1992) Cell. Immunology, 
143, 127), induction of interferon gamma by resting and activated T-and 
NK-cells (M. Kobayashi et al., supra; S. H. Chan et al. (1991) J. Exp. 
Med., 173, 869), and promotion of Th1-type helper cell responses (R.
