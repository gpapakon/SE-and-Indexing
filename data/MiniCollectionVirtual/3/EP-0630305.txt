<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oscillator used in 
continuous casting to move the water cooled mould to and fro 
relative to the solidifying casting to prevent the casting from 
sticking to the mould and causing surface defects in the cast 
product. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
continuous casting machine in which the cast product is guided 
out of the mould in a curved path having a predetermined casting 
radius so that the cast product may be withdrawn and trimmed to 
required lengths in a horizontal orientation. The oscillator 
according to the invention comprises both means to oscillate the 
mould and means to guide the mould along a curved path. In the past, moulds were mounted on a beam having a length 
corresponding to the radius of curvature and pivoted at the 
centre of curvature. The mould was mounted on the other end of 
the beam and moved with the beam during oscillation. The rather 
long beam length involved and many mechanical difficulties 
encountered with changes in beam length, fatigue, and load on 
the bearings were found to be impractical. The aforementioned problems were at least parts 
addressed by the adoption of short levers provided in pairs and 
connecting the mould to an external support disposed between the 
mould and the centre of curvature. The short levers were 
inclined relative to each other and aligned to the centre of the 
casting arc. This improvement in the art is well described in 
U.S. Patent No. 3,343,592 to Vogel. Because the reciprocating 
movement of the mould is very short (0.050 to 0.5 in) the 
deviation of the short lever travel from the casting arc is very 
small and the mould movement along the casting radius is 
acceptable. However, the pin joints of this design introduce 
some undesirable clearances which have to be carefully 
controlled to make the method practical. The operating 
conditions of a casting plant, including extremely high 
temperatures, moisture, and abrasive substances in the  
 
atmosphere make the oscillator highly maintenance intensive. In U.S. 4,456,052 to Takashi Kawakami, the short lever 
design is improved by introducing a hydraulic cylinder which 
compensates for bearing clearances. The present tendency is to increase the frequency of 
continuous casting moulds and permit frequencies of up to 400 
cylces per minute. This requirement has lead to completely new 
designs using a multitude of eccentrics as in U.S. 4,480,678 to 
Cazaux et al. While this is an improvement, it is a high cost 
mechanically complex apparatus
