<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hose for use
in a motor vehicle. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a multi-layer hose which can be
employed as a fuel line or vapor recovery line in a motor
vehicle.Single layer fuel lines and vapor return lines
of synthetic materials such as polyamides have been
proposed and employed in the past. Fuel lines employing
such materials generally have lengths of at least several
meters. It is important that the line, once installed,
not materially change during the length of operation,
either by shrinkage or elongation or as a result of the
stresses to which the line may be subject during use.It is also becoming increasingly important that
the lines employed be essentially impervious to
hydrocarbon emissions due to permeation through the
tubing. It is anticipated that future Federal and state
regulations will fix the limit for permissible
hydrocarbon emissions due to permeation through such
lines. Regulations which will be enacted in states such
as California will fix the total passive hydrocarbon
emission for a vehicle at 2 g/m2 per 24 hour period as
calculated by evaporative emission testing methods such
as those outlined in Title 13 of the California Code of
Regulations, section 1976, proposed amendment of
September 26, 1991. To achieve the desired total vehicle
emission levels, a hydrocarbon permeation level for the
lines equal to or below 0.5 g/m2 per 24 hour period would
be required.Finally, it is also imperative that the fuel
line employed be impervious to interaction with corrosive
materials present in the fuel such as oxidative agents
and surfactants as well as additives such as ethanol and
methanol. Various types of tubing have been proposed to
address these concerns. In general, the most successful
of these have been co-extruded multi-layer tubing which
employ a relatively thick outer layer composed of a
material resistant to the exterior environment. The
innermost layer is thinner and is composed of a material
which is chosen for its ability to block diffusion of
materials such as aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols and
other materials present in fuel blends, to the outer
layer. The materials of choice for the inner layer are
polyamides such as Nylon 6, Nylon 6.6, Nylon 11, and
Nylon 12.Alcohol and aromatics in the fluid conveyed
through the tube diffuse at different rates through the
tubing wall from the aliphatic components. The resulting
change in the composition of the liquid in the tubing can
change the solubility thresholds of the material
