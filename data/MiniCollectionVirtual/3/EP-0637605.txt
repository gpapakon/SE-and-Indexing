<ABSTRACT>
This invention describes a method for making flexible, conventional, 
polyurethane slabstock foam having a substantially open cell structure from a 

polyfunctional polyol of 400-1500 equivalent weight, water, isocyanate, polyurethane 
catalysts and a foam processing aid which are combined to form a polyurethane foam 

and then mechanically cooled after the foam has risen. The foam processing aid 
contains at least one polyfunctional crosslinking agent which has at least two 

isocyanate reactive functionalities thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
Environmental pressures and ever-tightening governmental regulations 
have shifted flexible slabstock foam market production away from the use of 
conventional blowing agents such as CFC-11, methylene chloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. 
Generally, this pressure has forced the industry towards formulations 
with higher weight percentages of water. The physical blowing of such high water 
urethane foam formulations takes place through the evolution of carbon dioxide from 
the reaction of water and isocyanate. This replaces the traditional blowing method 
derived from the volatilization of conventional low boiling liquid blowing agents such 
as those listed above. The shift to these higher water formulations and away from 
conventional blowing agents has placed many additional demands on flexible slabstock 
foam production. Three of these worthy of special notation are described. First, the 
use of higher amounts of water typically results in higher exotherms leading to 
increased foam discoloration, scorching problems, and potential for fire. Second, an 
increased urea content is common in higher water systems leading to higher hardness 
values. Thus, some softer foam grades are not readily attainable using only water as  
 
the blowing agent. Third, a dramatic detrimental change in some of the key physical 
properties of the foam, such as compression sets (ASTM D-3574), tensile strengths 
(ASTM D-3574), tear strengths (ASTM D-3574), elongation values (ASTM D-3574) 
and hysterisis values (ASTM D-3574) are also common in many higher water content 
systems. These problems have generated many opportunities for creative 
solutions to overcome the inherent pitfalls of the current all water blown slabstock 
foam production technology. Two of the primary solutions to these problems are the 
use of low index technologies and the use of mechanical cooling methods. The index 
number is the amount of isocyanate present in the foam as a percentage of the 
calculated stoichiometric amount of isocyanate needed to react all active hydrogen 
components m the formulation. For example, an isocyanate index of 110 means that 
110% of the amount of isocyanate stoichiometrically required to react with all active 
hydrogen compounds is used. Low index technologies use less than 100% of the amount of isocyanate 
needed to react all active hydrogen components in the formulation. Low index 
technologies allow for lower exotherms and lower hardness values relative to 
conventional index all water based (i.e., indexes typically
