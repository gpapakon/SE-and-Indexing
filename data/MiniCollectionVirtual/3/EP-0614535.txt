<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicle mounted 
radar tracking systems and more particularly to 
providing target track information during changes in 
vehicle heading and during roll and/or pitch of a 
radar system antenna with respect to a reference. Radar systems are typically provided with a 
mechanical stabilization system for controlling the 
angular position of a radar antenna to thereby 
maintain a constant reference frame for the antenna 
with respect to a reference axis or plane, e.g., 
ground. Such mechanical stabilization is usually 
accomplished using servomechanisms, e.g., gimbal and 
drive systems. Position or rate gyros are typically 
used to sense vehicle pitch and roll, and issue 
position signals directly to the stabilization system 
to maintain the desired antenna reference. A problem with using gimbal and drive systems 
for mechanical antenna stabilization is that they add 
significant weight to the radar system, which is of 
particular concern in radars intended for use on 
aircraft. Additionally, because of complexities 
associated with stabilization systems, they are prone 
to frequent repair and maintenance. Another problem 
is that servomechanisms required for roll and pitch 
stabilization increase the overall size of an antenna 
assembly with the result that within a given 
installation space, the area for the radiating  
 
portion of the antenna, and consequently the antenna 
gain and resolution, must be reduced. A radar antenna that is rotational only about a 
vertical or yaw axis and not provided with roll and 
pitch stabilization, i.e., having a fixed platform, 
is referred to as being "strapped down". A strapped 
down antenna eliminates weight penalties and 
complexities associated with mechanical stabilization 
systems, and also reduces the space requirement for a 
given antenna. However, any roll and pitch 
experienced by a vehicle carrying the antenna is 
translated directly to the antenna. Movement of the 
antenna in roll and pitch may look to the radar 
system like movement of the target, and therefore, 
fixed platform antennas are incapable of providing 
accurate target position information during roll 
and/or pitch of the antenna, thereby preventing the 
radar tracking system from maintaining target 
tracking and correlation accuracy during antenna roll 
and/or pitch. The azimuth error suffered by radars which are 
not roll and pitch stabilized manifests itself as a 
"blurred" or "smeared" representation of the target 
on a radar display. Additionally, when roll
