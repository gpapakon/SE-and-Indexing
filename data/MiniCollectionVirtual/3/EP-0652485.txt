<ABSTRACT>
A lithographic process for fabricating a device is disclosed. An area of 
radiation sensitive material is formed on a substrate. The radiation sensitive material 

contains a polymeric component. The polymeric component is the copolymerization 
product of a maleimide monomer and at least two other monomers. Acid labile 

groups are pendant to one of the monomers with which the maleimide monomer is 
copolymerized. The acid labile groups are pendant to less than 50 mole percent of 

the monomers that make up the copolymer. The acid labile groups are not pendant 
to the maleimide monomer. 
The radiation sensitive material is patternwise exposed to radiation after 
it is formed on the substrate. The patternwise exposure transfers an image into the 

radiation sensitive material. The image is developed into a pattern in the radiation 
sensitive material. The pattern is then transferred into the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fabrication of devices by a lithographic
process.Devices such as integrated circuits are complex structures made of a
variety of materials. These materials are precisely configured to form the desired
device. The materials are configured using a variety of processes. A lithographic
process is frequently used to transfer the desired configuration into a substrate to
fabricate such devices.Lithographic processes transfer the desired configuration into the
substrate using intermediate materials frequently referred to as resists. An image of
the desired configuration is first introduced into the resist by exposing the resist to
radiation in a patternwise manner. The pattern defines the configuration that is to be
transferred, ultimately, into the substrate. The radiation introduces the image into
the resist by inducing a chemical change in those portions of the resist that are
exposed to the radiation. This chemical change is then exploited to develop a pattern
from the image in the resist. The pattern is then transferred from the resist into the
substrate.The efficacy of a lithographic process depends at least in part on the
resist used to transfer the pattern into the substrate. Certain types of resists offer
particular advantages in the context of lithographic processes. For example, some
resists undergo chemical amplification, i.e., the effect of the radiation is amplified
because the radiation induces a chemical event which propagates multiple other
chemical events.Certain chemically amplified resists include a polymer in which the
aqueous base solubility of the polymer is reduced by pendant protective groups.
These protective groups are stripped from the polymer by a catalyst that is produced
by incident radiation. The resist material in the exposed region, but not the
unexposed region, consequently undergoes a change in aqueous base solubility. The
difference in the aqueous base solubility between the unexposed and exposed regions
of the resist is then exploited to develop the pattern into the resist.Examples of chemically amplified resists are disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,939,070 to Ito et al. These resists contain hydroxystyrene polymers that have
recurrent pendant groups such as t-butoxycarbonyl (tBOC) groups. These groups 
replace the hydrogen in the hydroxyl moiety pendant to the styrene polymer
backbone and reduce the aqueous base solubility of the hydroxystyrene when so
attached. These reactive groups are cleaved from the polymer in the presence of acid
which is
