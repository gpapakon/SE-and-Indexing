<ABSTRACT>
System to join stretches of tube (10) which allows the construction of 
handrails and fences adaptable to any unevenness of the ground. It consists 

of:
 

One base plate (9) to fix the vertical support to the ground. One piece (7) 
to join the vertical support to this base (9) which allows a movement up to 

180ยบ . A third piece set into the upper end of the first stretch of the 
support with a screw threaded stud (2), which adapts to a fourth piece (3) 

set into the upper stretch, and which allows to fix a fifth piece consisting 
of a bush (5), a pin (6) and another piece (4) to fix another support. This 

piece allows a movement in the horizontal plane of 180ยบ and in the 
vertical plane of 90ยบ . This knot can be repeated as many times as 

necessary. 
The upper piece (1) of the support is an hemisphere with a female screw to 
be adapted to a piece "three" (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a new system to join 
stretches of tube, which allows the construction of handrails 
and fences adaptable to any unevenness of the ground without 
welding and with the possibility of recovering the pieces 
once they have fulfilled their function. Before the invention of this system, the handrails had to be 
built with several points of welding, moreover it was 
necessary to study the unevenness of the ground and too many 
stretches of tube were needed, which required a greater 
amount of labour and skilled workers. This invention refers to a system of pieces pressed into the 
tubes and screwed to one another, which can be put in any 
position, both vertically and horizontally. The vertical supports consist of one hemipherical cup (1) at 
the top with a female screw in the inferior part. Piece 2 is a bush set into the stanchion with a screw 
threaded stud where pieces 1 and 2 can be adapted. Piece 3 is set into the tube or stanchion 10 and has a female 
screw where another piece 2 is screwed. One or more pieces 5 are trapped between these two; these 
pieces 5 allow the rotation in one plane, and joined to piece 
4 by one pin 6, this piece 4 can be folded if required by the 
unevenness of the ground.  Knots 4, 5 and 6 between 2 and 3 can be repeated in the 
stanchion as many times as necessary. Piece 7 is also a bush set into the tube 10 with two inferior 
laps which fasten the stanchion to piece 9 by means of a pin 
or screw 8. Piece 9 or base of the stanchion is fixed to the ground with 
several screws. The union of pieces 9 and 7 by means of a pin of screw 8 
allows a movement up to 180 ยบ. This system is divided into three different figures (Fig. 1, 
Fig. 2, and Fig. 3) with several pieces repeated in each of 
them. 
Figure 1 - It consists of two pieces 1 and 2 which offer the 
possibility to trap pieces 5 and 4 if it were necessary to 
build a handrail. Figure 2 - This set 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be repeated as 
many times as necessary, and at the height required by the 
fence or handrail. Figure 3 - Two pieces joined by a pin or screw 8 which fixes 
the stanchion to the ground and allows to adapt it to any 
unevenness of the ground.

<CLAIMS>
Handrail and fence consiting of a system of pieces set 
into the tubes and screwed to one another, which can be put 

in any position, both vertically and horizontally. 
Handrail and fence, according to the previous claim, in 
which the vertical supports have at the top a hemipherical 

cup with a female screw in the inferior part (1). 
Handrail and fence, according to previous claims, with a 
bush 2 set into the stanchion and with a screw threaded stud 

to adapt piece 1. 
Handrail and fence, according to previous claims, with a 
bush 3 with a female screw to adapt piece 2. 
Handrail and fence, according to previous claims, is a 
set 4, 5, and 6 which offers the possibility to rotate around 

the stud of piece 2 and to fold piece 4 by means of a pin 6, 
fastened to piece 5. 
Handrail and fence, according to previous claims, with a 
bush 7 set into the lower part of the stanchion with two 

perforated laps to trap piece 9 or base of the stanchion. 
These two pieces joined by a screw or pin 8 will keep the 

support in vertical position even if the ground is uneven.
