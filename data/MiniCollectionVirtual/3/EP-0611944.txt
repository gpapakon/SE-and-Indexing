<ABSTRACT>
A testing circuit is provided for testing the operability both of a load (30) and of a 
capacitor (26) incorporated into a main detonator circuit and arranged to discharge 

into the load for detonation thereof. A test pulse is generated at a central controller 
to which a ring of detonators is connected on a harness. The test pulse is routed via 

the harness for storage in the capacitor. A controlled switch (44) is operated to 
allow the capacitor to discharge into the load. A transistor (52) is operated by the 

discharge signal, the transistor having an output for delivering a discharge value 
signal (56) in response to the discharge signal remaining above or falling below a 

threshold value. The discharge value signal is latched and is in turn used to inhibit 
a local oscillator (66). The inhibited signal from the oscillator is routed back to the 

controller so as to indicate a fault either in the capacitor (26) or in the load (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a testing circuit for testing the operability of a load and a 
charge storage device arranged to discharge into the load. South African patent 90/7794 filed in the name of the applicant is directed towards 
timing apparatus for activating a number of electronic detonators at predetermined 
time intervals. The central control and programming unit is linked to a series of the 
electronic detonators by means of a bidirectional harness, which is arranged in a 
loop. In order to ensure that spurious signals do not activate the detonators, a 
number of safety features have been incorporated into the timing apparatus. One 
such safety feature is the provision of separate logic and detonator circuits having 
separate lines from the central controller. The logic circuit is used to power up the 
detonator logic, and the separate detonator circuit is used to energize a charge 
storage device, such as a capacitor, just prior to initiation of the blasting sequence. 
By providing separate circuits, the logic circuitry can be tested in full without 
danger of the testing signals activating the electronic detonator circuit. One disadvantage of the testing procedure described in South African patent 
90/7794 is that it does not extend to testing of the detonator circuit, and especially 
the capacitor or the load. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a testing circuit for 
testing the operability both of a load and of a charge storage device incorporated 
into a main circuit and being arranged to discharge into the load for detonation of 
the load, the testing circuit comprising: 
a) signal routing means for routing a test signal from a signal 
generator for storage in the charge storage device; b) discharge means for allowing the charge storage device to provide 
a discharge signal by discharging through the load the charge 
derived from the test signal; c) monitoring means for monitoring at least one of the parameters 
of the discharge signal, and d) inhibiting means responsive to the monitoring means for 
inhibiting operation of the main circuit in the event of at least one 
of the monitored parameters falling outside predetermined limits, 
the limits being determined with reference to the operability both 
of the load and of the charge storage device.  Preferably, the monitoring means comprises a first switch which is arranged to be 
operated by the discharge signal, the first switch receiving a monitoring signal a 
predetermined time after the test signal, and
