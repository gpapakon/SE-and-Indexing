<ABSTRACT>
While some of the characteristics of medical pathologies or 
industrial defects in images are subject to classification, many 

aspects of these abnormalities do not lend themselves to precise 
programmable characterizations. Neural networks have been 

useful in recognizing patterns in a number of applications 
involving multiple variables whose precise interactions are not 

well-understood or quantifiable. In order to aid the medical 
imaging personnel, industrial troubleshooters and others in 

locating potential anomalies in an image, this invention employs 
neural network analysis to help identify regions of suspected 

anomalies.

<DESCRIPTION>
Cross Reference to Related Applications This application is 
a continuation-in-part of application serial number 07/664,906, 
filed March 5, 1991. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the 
computer-aided analysis of digitized images and, in particular, to 
the location of possible anomalies in medical diagnostic and/or 
industrial images. Description of the Related Art It has become an established 
and wide-spread medical practice to perform mammograms to 
determine the possible presence of breast cancer or other 
pathological conditions. The amount of time spent by health care 
professionals in scanning a large number of screening exam 
images tends to be very short and statistics indicate that 
diagnostic accuracy may suffer. Also, some features of these 
radiological images are such that their significance can only be 
recognized by specialized experts. While diagnostic uncertainty may not exist in those 
instances in which a tumor or cancerous tissue is well developed 
and, thus, clearly visible to all, it will be appreciated that in the 
very early stages of the development of such tissue 
abnormalities, a reliable diagnosis based upon a brief 
examination of radiological images is much more difficult. Yet 
early diagnosis is a very important factor in arresting and  
 
effectively treating cancerous tissues and tissues which exhibit 
conditions precursory to cancer, particularly breast cancer. In addition to the benefits of early determination of 
pathology in medical diagnostic images, such as mammograms, 
many types of defects in industrial images must also be detected 
during product manufacture to prevent catastrophic failure, e.g. 
in airplane turbine blades. Many types of anomalies in 
industrial materials have been identified and classified by 
computer analysis of an X-ray image. For example, in some 
cases, metal cracks or incomplete welds have precisely 
identifiable characteristics which may be programmed into a 
standard algorithmic computer for automated analysis. 
However, in most cases they cannot. Still other types of defects, 
such as corrosion pits and delaminations in honeycombed or 
layered materials, are even more difficult to characterize due to 
their variety of manifestations. Both the medical diagnostic images and the latter variety of 
industrial x-ray images are not easily and simply classifiable and 
do not lend themselves to precise programmable 
characterizations, such as an expert system. Conventional 
algorithmic computers excel in applications

A method for computer-aided detection of possible 
anomalies in a digitized image comprising a plurality of M x N picture 

elements each representing an optical density in the digitized image, 
the method comprising the steps of: 


a) subdividing the digitized image into a plurality of 
predetermined regions each comprising m x n picture elements, 

where m 
<
 M and n 
<
 N; 
b) subtracting background from each predetermined 
region of the digitized image; 
c) selecting a subregion comprising p x q picture 
elements, where p 
<

d) normalizing the image data from the p x q subregion; 
e) using a neural network system, analyzing each 
predetermined subregion of the digitized image to recognize any 

pattern indicative of an occurrence of a possible anomaly; 
   the neural network system comprising at least two 

member neural networks each trained to recognize a particular 
predetermined anomaly type within a predetermined size range and 

to produce an output signal value indicative of the presence of said 
predetermined anomaly type; 
f) comparing each of the output values of each of the 
member neural networks to a first predetermined threshold value 

corresponding to each member neural network above which the 
presence of a possible anomaly is indicated; 
g) comparing each output value that exceeds each first 
predetermined threshold(s) to each of the other output values that 

exceed each corresponding first predetermined threshold to select 
the maximum signal value; 
h) comparing the maximum signal value to a second 
predetermined threshold value above which the presence of a 

possible anomaly is indicated; 
i) based upon the comparisons of step h), determining 
the location within the digitized image of each possible anomaly; 
j) using a clustering analysis on the locations of possible 
anomalies of step i), identifying each vicinity on the digitized image at 

which a cluster of locations of possible anomalies occurs; and,
