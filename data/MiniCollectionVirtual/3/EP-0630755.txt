<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a discharge 
recovery processing of an ink jet recording apparatus 

which forms an image on the recording medium by 
discharging the ink. The invention aims to prevent the 

increase in the running costs and the shortened life of 
a waste ink tank by preventing the wasteful ink 

consumption which may be caused by the dual use of an 
automatic recovery processing and a manual recovery 

processing after the replacement of an ink tank. 
Also, the invention further aims to provide an ink 
jet recording apparatus with high safety and 

reliability as well as effecting an appropriate 
recovery by controlling the movement of head in 

involving the recovery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording apparatus which forms an image on a
recording medium by discharging ink.Conventionally, various recording methods have
been put into practical use for image forming
apparatus (so-called recording apparatus or a
printer) for forming an image on a recording medium
such as paper and OHP recording sheet.The recording methods include a wire dot method
which is an impact recording method, a thermal transfer
method using an ink ribbon to transfer ink
fused by heating, a thermal recording method using a
thermosensitive recording paper which is colored upon
the reaction with the heating of a recording head, and
an ink jet recording method of forming an image on a
recording medium by discharging ink.Among the various kinds of recording methods,
attention is particularly paid to the ink jet recording
method as a silent method with low running costs
because ink is discharged directly onto the recording medium.
recording medium. In ink jet recording apparatuses a
disposable recording head is typically utilized in
practice in which the recording head
and an ink reservoir (ink tank)
are integrated and mounted exchangeably on the
recording apparatus. However, an ink jet recording
apparatus of the type in which only the ink reservoir
is exchangeable and the
recording head is a permanent or longer life component has
been put to practical use because of its inexpensive
costs for the recording head.In the above ink jet recording apparatuses,
capping means for covering the ink discharge ports (nozzles)
of the recording head to protect the ink from drying is provided,
or a discharge recovery
process for causing discharging of ink through the nozzles
to remove ink of increased viscosity or
ink containing dust or dirt is typically
practiced, in order to maintain the ink discharge
condition of the recording head excellent and normal.Exemplary of the above capping means is a cap
formed of an elastic material such as rubber which is
placed opposite to the nozzle formation face of the
recording head and can be brought into or
out of contact with the nozzle formation face at a
position for capping, thereby preventing the drying of 
the ink in or near the nozzles by capping, when
discharge of the ink has not occurred for a
predetermined time when there is no recording
operation being carried out or even during a recording operation.Further, exemplary of the above discharge recovery
processing is a process (preliminary discharge) for
discharging ink through all the discharge ports
