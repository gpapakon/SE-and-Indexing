<ABSTRACT>
A paper sheet, especially suitable for use as a household 
paper towel, can be made using a modified wet pressing 

process by adding a wet strength resin to the papermaking 
fibers and, after initially forming the wet web, conforming 

the wet web to the surface contour of a relatively coarse 
fabric to give the web a textured surface. The web is dried 

to substantially preserve its texture and thereafter creped. 
The resulting web has an exceptionally high degree of bulk 

and absorbency not previously attained by non-throughdried 
paper products.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the manufacture of paper products such as paper towels, 
dinner napkins, tissue and the like, there are generally two 
different methods of making basesheets for these various 
products. One method is commonly referred to as wet-pressing 
and the other is referred to as throughdrying. While the two 
methods may be the same at the front end and the back end of 
the process, they differ primarily in the manner in which 
water is removed from the wet web after its initial 
formation. For example, in the wet-pressing method, which is the older 
and more conventional method of making paper towels, the 
newly-formed wet web is typically transferred onto a 
papermaking felt and thereafter pressed against the surface 
of a steam-heated Yankee dryer while it is still supported by 
the felt. As the web is transferred to the surface of the 
Yankee, water is expressed from the web and is absorbed by 
the felt. The dewatered web, typically having a consistency 
of about 40 percent, is then dried while on the hot surface 
of the Yankee. The web is then creped to soften it and 
provide stretch to the resulting sheet. A disadvantage of 
wet pressing is that the pressing step densifies the web, 
thereby decreasing the bulk and absorbency of the sheet, 
which must be restored by the subsequent creping step. In the throughdrying method, which has become more common in 
recent years, the newly-formed web is transferred to a 
relatively porous fabric and non-compressively dried by 
passing hot air through the web. The resulting web can then 
be transferred to a Yankee dryer for creping. Because the 
web is substantially dry when transferred to the Yankee, the 
density of the web is not significantly reduced by the 
transfer. Also, by drying the web while supported on the  
 
throug hdrying fabric, a less dense sheet is produced in the 
first place. This results in a more bulky and absorbent 
sheet. However, a disadvantage of throughdrying is the 
operational energy costs and the capital costs associated 
with the throughdryers. Because there are many existing wet-pressing paper machines 
making paper towels and the like, and because there is a 
continuing desire to improve the bulk and absorbency of such 
products, there is a need for a means of producing paper 
towels having throughdried characteristics using existing 
wet-pressing paper machines without the expense of adding new 
throughdryers. This object is solved by the paper sheet of independent claim 
1 or 20, the paper towel of independent claim 7 or 21 and the
