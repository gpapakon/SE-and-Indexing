<ABSTRACT>
Device for turning hosiery items inside out including 
means for gripping a hosiery item (3) and moving it along an 

advancement direction (4) so that the top (3a) of the 
hosiery item (3) is orientated in the advancement direction 

(4), and opening means (5) that engage the hosiery item (3) 
and act transversely to the advancement direction (4) to 

open the top (3a) of the hosiery item (3). The device 
furthermore includes means (23) for turning the hosiery item 

(3) inside out that comprise a first component that can be 
inserted in the hosiery item (3) through the open top (3a), 

until it reaches proximate to the toe, and has, starting 
from its end meant to be inserted in the hosiery item (3), a 

cavity for the insertion of a second rod-like component 
which can engage the toe of the hosiery item arranged at the 

end of the first component. The second component can be 
inserted in the first component in the direction opposite to 

the direction of insertion of the first component in the 
hosiery item (3), turning the hosiery item (3) inside out 

along the second component. There are also means for 
removing the inside-out hosiery item (3) from the second 

component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for turning 
hosiery items, typically socks and stockings, inside out 
with high operating reliability. As it is known, hosiery items are generally 
manufactured by forming a tubular item that is open at its 
two opposite ends and by subsequently closing one of these 
two ends, which constitutes the toe of the hosiery item, by 
stitching or darning. Since the toe of the hosiery item must be closed while 
said hosiery item is turned inside out, it is necessary to 
turn said hosiery item inside out prior to its packaging. Among the various devices currently used to turn 
hosiery items inside out, a device is known which comprises 
a pair of rollers with parallel axes that are rotated about 
the respective axes in opposite directions. The two rollers 
can move mutually closer or further apart so that the 
hosiery item to be turned inside out is placed between them; 
the hosiery item is placed between the two rollers so that 
its toe protrudes from the side of the region of mutual 
contact of the rollers that lies in the direction of the 
tangential speed in the mutual contact region. On the side toward which the toe of the hosiery item 
protrudes, this known device has a rod which is arranged in 
the plane tangent to both rollers and can move 
longitudinally to engage the toe of the hosiery item and 
advance between the two rollers in the direction opposite to 
that of their peripheral speed in the region of mutual 
contact, so that the combined action of the advancement of  
 
the rod and of the rotation of the rollers turns the hosiery 
item inside out along the rod. These devices furthermore generally have a pair of 
counter-rotating secondary rollers that are arranged 
adjacent to the two main rollers, on the side opposite to 
the rod insertion side, and rotate in reverse with respect 
to said two main rollers so as to engage the hosiery item, 
which is inside out on the rod, when it is at the end of its 
advancement, and remove it from the rod while the rod is 
moved backward to its initial position. In other kinds of devices, substantially based on the 
same operating concept, the two rollers are replaced with 
two mutually facing belts that are meant to receive, between 
them, the hosiery item and the rod which has engaged the toe 
thereof. The two belts are actuated, as regards their 
portion which is in contact with the hosiery item, with 
speeds orientated in the same direction and opposite to the 
direction along which the rod is inserted between the

hosiery item (3) and moving it along an advancement 
direction (4) so that the top (3a) of the hosiery item (3) 

is orientated in the advancement direction (4); opening 
means (5) that engage the hosiery item (3) and act 

transversely to said advancement direction (4) to open said 
top (3a); means (23) for turning the hosiery item (3) inside 

out that comprise a first component (24) that can be 
inserted in the hosiery item (3) with one of its ends 

through said open top (3a), until it reaches proximate to 
the toe (3b), and forms, starting from said end, a cavity 

(28) for the insertion of a second rod-like component (25) 
which can engage the toe (3b) of the hosiery item (3) 

arranged at said end of the first component (24) and can be 
inserted in said first component (24) through said end in 

the direction opposite to the direction of insertion of said 
first component (24) in the hosiery item (3), turning said 

hosiery item (3) inside out along said second component 
(25); and means (29a,29b) for removing the inside-out 

hosiery item (3) from said second component (25). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
at least the end of 
said first component (24) that is meant 
to be inserted in the top (3a) of the hosiery item (3) has a 

substantially annular shape. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said grip and advancement means (2) comprise at least two 

pairs (6a,6b,10a,10b) of belts: a first pair of belts  
 

(6a,6b) with portions that are arranged substantially 
parallel to said advancement direction (4) and are spaced 

from one another, so as to make contact with one side of the
