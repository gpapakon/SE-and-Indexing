<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a Hg-series 1223 type oxide superconductor
which exhibits superconductive characteristics at
temperatures higher than the liquid nitrogen
temperature.A superconductor exhibits various characteristics
which cannot be found in other substances. Specifically,
the electrical resistance of the superconductor
is rendered zero at temperatures lower than a critical
temperature Tc, with the result that the superconductor
exhibits a complete diamagnetism and produces Josephson
effects. Because of these characteristics, the superconductor
is expected to be used for forming, for
example, a power cable without current loss, a
superconducting generator, a material for high field
magnets for nuclear fusion plasma confinement, a
material for magnetic levitation vehicle, a magnetic
shielding material, and a high speed computer.Since Bednorz and Muller found in 1986 a La-Ba-Cu-O
series superconductor having a Tc of about 30K, it is
reported that superconductivity has been recognized in
about 30 kinds of copper oxides. Particularly, a
Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O series superconductor having a Tc of 125K
has attracted attention as a superconductor exhibiting
the highest Tc. On the other hand, it has been reported
recently that a Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O series superconductor 
(1223 type) exhibits a Tc of 133.5K (A. Schiling et al.,
Nature (London) 363,56 (1993)).The Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O series oxide superconductor of
substantially single phase ceramics can be produced by a
synthetic method, which necessitates an ultra-high
pressure of 5 to 6 GPa (H. Hirabayashi et al., Jpn. J.
Appl. Phys. 32, L1206 (1993)). The synthetic method
necessitating such an ultra-high pressure requires an
ultra-high pressure synthetic apparatus which is highly
costly and, thus, is not adapted for mass production
of the oxide superconductor. In addition, the particular
synthetic method permits producing an oxide
superconductor in only such a small amount as about
10 mg in a single operation. Further, the obtained
oxide superconductor does not have a single phase
completely.Also known is a method of obtaining a Hg series
oxide superconductor without requiring an ultra-high
pressure. In this method, a powder mixture is prepared
by mixing HgO with a complex oxide such as a Ba2Ca2Cu3O7
complex oxide, or a complex oxide of BaCuO2 and Ca2CuO3,
followed by shaping the powder mixture and subsequently
applying a heat treatment to the shaped body at 800 to
850°C for 5 to 10 hours. However, the resultant Hg
series oxide
