<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
liquid level indicating system and more specifically to an 
anti-slosh circuit switchable between a short time constant 
and a long time constant without requiring the use of a 
large capacitor. The invention is particularly applicable 
to measuring the fuel level in a motor vehicle fuel tank and 
accordingly will be described with reference to such a 
system. A basic fuel gauge system includes a liquid level 
sensor in a fuel tank and a gauge receiving a sensor signal 
to indicate to the driver the status of the sensor unit and, 
therefore, the fuel level. A typical sensor may include a 
float body pivoting on a float arm connected to a variable 
resistance which generates a voltage signal proportional to 
the level of the float. However, fuel level variations due 
to movement of the vehicle (known as "fuel slosh") cause the 
sensor signal to include transient errors with respect to 
the actual level fuel in the tank. Since these transient 
errors have an average value of zero, the actual fuel level 
can still be determined by obtaining the average of the 
sensor signal over a sufficiently long time period. 
Accordingly, a variety of damping arrangements have been 
incorporated into gauge systems to eliminate rapid transient 
movements of the fuel gauge due to fuel slosh. Electronically damped anti-slosh circuits 
frequently employ RC integrator circuits to derive an 
average signal. It is also known to limit the slew rate of 
a signal amplifier to slow the response of an anti-slosh 
circuit in order to damp the system response to changes in 
the sensor signal. In order to obtain the long time 
constants which are required in anti-slosh circuits, the 
prior art has used undesirably large capacitors, such as 
electrolytics, which are expensive and create packaging 
problems. Leakage currents associated  
 
with the large capacitors also create disadvantages such as 
inaccuracy or nonsymmetrical operation as the level signal 
slows up or down. DE-A-3 444 138 (Goertler) describes an anti-slosh 
circuit for a liquid level signal from a liquid level sensor 
in a vehicle, the signal having a voltage varying within a 
first range of voltages according to a sensed liquid level. 
The circuit comprising a voltage comparator for receiving 
the liquid level signal at one comparator input and for 
providing a bistable comparator output signal, an up/down 
counter for counting a clock signal to provide a count, the 
up/down counter being coupled to the voltage
