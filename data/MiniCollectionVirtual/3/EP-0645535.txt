<ABSTRACT>
In a fuel injector (1) arranged such that fuel 
injection is controlled by an opening/closing operation 

of a solenoid valve (5), occurrence of bouncing motion of the 
valve rod (521) after the deenergization of the solenoid valve (5) 

to terminate the fuel injection is prevented by forming a 
stopper (541) with a flat surface (544) for making in-plane contact 

with the end surface of the valve rod (528) and defining in the 
valve rod (521) a pressure chamber (550) having an opening at the end 

surface. The chamber (550) is adapted to be filled with the 
fuel to suppress the bouncing motion of the valve rod (521) at 

the valve (5) opening operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a unit type fuel
injector for fuel injection in an internal combustion
engine.The conventional unit type fuel injector has a
fuel injection section for injecting pressurized fuel
received from a fuel pressurization section for
pressurizing the fuel and is constituted so that the
pressure in a fuel pressure chamber of the fuel
pressurization section can be spilled to a fuel supply
return chamber provided in a solenoid valve section by
lifting a valve needle in the solenoid valve section off
the associated valve seat cone. The fuel injection
timing can be controlled by controlling the timing at
which the needle is seated on the seat cone. However,
since the pressure in the fuel pressure chamber of a fuel
injector of this type is extremely high, the pressure in
the fuel supply return chamber rises rapidly at the time
the needle of the solenoid valve section is lifted off
the seat cone for spilling the pressure in the fuel
pressure chamber. Since the pressure this produces in
the fuel supply return chamber causes a force to act on
the needle in the opposite direction from that for
lifting the needle off the seat cone, the pressure in the 
fuel pressure chamber cannot drop sharply. This degrades
fuel injection cutoff.For overcoming this problem, Japanese Patent
Application Public Disclosure No. Hei 2-67455(67455/1990)
teaches a fuel injector in which the valve needle is
formed on one end of a needle valve rod, a flange is
provided on the needle valve rod to be in liquid-tight
sliding contact with the wall defining the space
surrounding it, and the pressure produced in the fuel
supply return chamber by the separation of the needle
from the seat cone is caused to act on the flange in the
direction causing the valve to open. More specifically,
the proposed fuel injector is configured so that the
pressure increase produced in the fuel supply return
chamber at the time the needle rises off the seat cone is
led through a passage in the needle valve rod to the
opposite side from the needle and applied to the flange.
This configuration is disadvantageous in that the force
produced by the rapid pressure increase arising in the
fuel supply return chamber at the time the needle lifts
off the seat cone acts directly on the needle in the
direction causing it to move toward the seat cone before
the pressure led to the flange can act on it in the
opposite direction. Valve opening therefore tends to be
hindered even when the control current to the solenoid in
the solenoid valve section is turned

<CLAIMS>
A unit type fuel injector (1) for internal combustion engines comprising a fuel
pressurization section (3) having a fuel pressure chamber (33) and a pump plunger

disposed in the fuel pressure chamber (33) for pressurizing fuel supplied from fuel
pump means, a fuel injection section (4) for spraying fuel pressurized by the fuel

pressurization section (3), and a solenoid valve section (5) which is connected with
the fuel pump means via fuel passage means for fuel supply and return and which

at a prescribed time during the period that the pump plunger pressurizes fuel in the
fuel pressure chamber (33) spills pressurized fuel in the fuel pressure chamber (33)

to the fuel passage means for terminating fuel spraying by the fuel injection section

the fuel reservoir (517) to decrease in diameter in the direction of the armature
chamber (513) and to face inward toward the reservoir (517) such that movement of

the valve rod (520) away from the armature chamber causes the valve head (523) to
move into the fuel reservoir away from the tapered portion,

fuel reservoir (517) with the armature chamber (513) if the valve head (523) is
