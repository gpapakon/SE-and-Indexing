<ABSTRACT>
A dipole moment detection and localization process and apparatus (10) in which 
the processing is applied to a single linear array of sensors (11) adapted to sense magnetic 

dipoles (13), and wherein data from the sensors (11) are processed as if it were 
derived from sets of subarrays (11a, 11b) of sensors. The apparatus (10) comprises a 

linear sensor array (11) whose output is processed by separate dipole moment detection 
and location processors (21a, 21b), or a single processor that provides for parallel processing 

operation. Data from the plurality of subarrays (11a, 11b) of sensors are processed 
in terms of Anderson functions and are correlated. The individual outputs of 

each processor (21a, 21b), or parallel processing portion, is coupled to a multiplier 
(22) that is adapted to correlate the signals. The dot product of these two correlated 

output signals is then formed to yield data that is thresholded and displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to dipole moment detection and localization, 
and more particularly, to split array dipole moment detection and localization apparatus 
and methods for detecting surface and subsurface vessels. Reference is made to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/616,158, filed 
November 20, 1990, for "Dipole Moment Detection and Localization," assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. 
The dipole moment detection and localization process described in this patent 
application has been demonstrated to yield dramatic performance improvement over 
currently available magnetic anomaly detection systems using a single sensor to detect a 
change in the local magnetic field. This dipole moment detection and localization process 
uses an array or multiple arrays of magnetic sensors and digital signal processing 
techniques to process the magnetic field's x, y, and z components for vector sensors 
and the total field component for scalar sensors at each of a plurality of positions relative 
to the array of sensors. In doing this, a magnetic signature of the magnetic field of 
a magnetic dipole located in the field is created. This magnetic signature provides an 
easily recognizable feature for an automatic pattern recognizing system. This process 
precomputes predicted target magnetic signatures for multiple orientations of the dipole 
at each of a plurality of range locations, and store them in a lookup table for magnetic 
signature matching.  Input data comprising the magnetic field strengths measured by the sensors are 
processed against a predicted background ambient noise using a linear model, where 
each sensor's output value is predicted using other sensors of the array, and a long 
term time average consistent with the relative motion of a target. This amounts to 
bandpass filtering or long term averaging of the signals from the sensor array. The 
bandpass filtered data is used to update the predicted data so that anomalies and other 
non-target data are removed from the signals that are processed. The sensor data is 
then processed against a set of Anderson adjoint matrices, which are a set of mathematical 
functions (Anderson functions) that decompose the magnetic field into its components 
in each of the maximum response locations for each dipole orientation. The resulting data is expressed in terms of sensed Anderson coefficients and 
this data is matched filtered, wherein it is mathematically correlated
