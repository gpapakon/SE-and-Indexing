<ABSTRACT>
An optimal menu inquiry system includes a 
skeleton data generating means, a tree structure data 

constructing means, a menu display means, a control 
means, and a menu candidate determining means. The 

skeleton data generating means generates inquiries, from 
a rule description describing the context of the 

inquiries, as skeleton data by sequentially linking the 
inquiries, from the first inquiry to the subsequent 

inquiries, in the form of a tree structure. The tree 
structure data constructing means constructs and updates 

tree structure data by sequentially retracing the 
skeleton data from first data. The menu display means 

displays menu items corresponding to constructed/updated 
tree structure data. The control means controls the 

tree structure data constructing means to update the 
tree structure data when one of the menu items displayed 

by the menu display means is selected. The menu 
candidate determining means evaluates an evaluable 

expression in the skeleton data by referring to the 
updated structure data, and determines menu item 

candidates to be displayed by the menu display means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optimal
menu inquiry system used to display a plurality of
inquiries having a hierarchical structure on a graphic
in a computer system having an interactive means for a
dialogue between the system and a user, and a system for
editing structure data by hierarchical menu inquiry
processing while displaying a plurality of inquiries
having a hierarchical structure on a graphic screen.As the first conventional technique associated
with menu inquiry processing of this type performed on a
computer system, a technique is available, in which when
an item is to be selected in response to one inquiry,
items on a menu are fixed in a program or a file
description. In this case, selection items considered
as unnecessary in terms of the context of inquiries are
included in menu inquiry processing.As the second conventional technique
associated with menu inquiry processing, a technique is
available, in which menu outputs, interpretation of
results, and menu determination programs are specially 
prepared for each inquiry to execute menu inquiry
processing in accordance with each inquiry.In addition, as the first technique of editing
structure data, a technique is available, which includes
a special inquiry means corresponding to each of
inquiries having a hierarchical structure, and an
editing means for editing structure data upon
determining each inquiry result, thereby constructing
structure data.Furthermore, as the second technique of
editing structure data, a syntax-directed editor used to
input/edit programs is available. In general, a program
is not simply a text but can be regarded as structure
data formed by hierarchically stacking texts. This
syntax-directed editor is formed, from an attribute
grammar describing the meaning and rule of a program
language, as a special syntax-directed editor for the
program language. The syntax-directed editor serves to
construct a syntax tree expressing the structure of the
program, thus editing the program as one type of
structure data.In the first conventional technique associated
with menu inquiry processing, since selection items
considered as unnecessary in terms of the context of
inquiries are also displayed, the operability is poor in
actually operating the computer system. In the second technique associated with menu
inquiry processing and the first technique of editing
structure data, since special processing corresponding
to each inquiry is required, the sizes of programs for
realizing the inquiry means and the editing means are
incr

<CLAIMS>
A menu inquiry system for displaying inquiries
with a hierarchical structure as menu items, prompting a

user to edit structure data, the system comprising:

skeleton data generating means for generating
inquiries, from a rule description describing a context of

the inquiries, as skeleton data by sequentially linking
the inquiries in the form of a tree structure having

branches, from a first inquiry on a first branch to a subsequent
inquiry on a second branch leading off the first

branch, further subsequent inquiries resulting in further
branching;
tree structure data constructing means for constructing
and updating tree structure data by sequentially

and hierarchically retracing the skeleton data from the
first inquiry, the skeleton data being sequentially

generated by said skeleton data generating means in
correspondence with each of the inquiries from the first

inquiry to the one or more subsequent inquiries;
menu display means for displaying to the user menu
items corresponding to the constructed or updated tree

structure data; and,
control means for controlling said tree structure
data constructing means to update the tree structure data

when one of the menu items displayed by said menu display
means is selected by the user;
characterized in that
 the inquiry system also comprises:
 
   menu candidate determining means for evaluating an

expression within the skeleton data using tree structure
data that has been constructed or updated by the tree

structure data constructing means, and for determining a
menu item candidate to be displayed by said menu display

means.
A menu inquiry system according to claim 1,
wherein the tree structure data is syntax tree data.
A menu inquiry system according to claim 2,
wherein the skeleton data has a plurality of types corresponding

to forms of inquiries.
A menu inquiry system according to claim 3,
wherein an inquiry means constructs syntax tree data by

performing selection processing while retracing toward
initial values skeleton data and syntax tree data which

has undergone selection processing, and starts inquiry
control means corresponding to a type of skeleton data

corresponding to the constructed syntax tree data.
A menu inquiry system according to claim 4,
wherein the construction of syntax tree data by the inquiry

means is initiated by the conclusion of construction
of syntax tree data by an immediately-preceding inquiry

means.
