<ABSTRACT>
A decoding device in TV-systems having pay-TV-channels. Each decoder (10) forms a self-contained unit, provided with at least one connection means (11) and at least one tap means (12) between which are coupled a plurality of decoding blocks (19) which are disposed parallel to each other and decode several channels simultaneously, wherein each block is adapted to convert up "its" channel to a UHF-channel of its own. Each self-contained decoding unit comprises a data channel (20) and a control logic (21) for remote control of the individual decoding blocks from a central administrative control unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decoding device in TV-systems, 
and more particularly to TV-systems of the kind where 
at least some of the channels are so called pay-TV-channels. As far as it is known all to day existing decoders for 
TV-systems of the above mentioned kind require that the respective 
subscriber first adjusts his TV-apparatus to a desired 
channel, and then chooses a channel on his decoder. In 
most cases this is performed by means of remote controller, 
which is specially designed for this purpose. The result is 
that the subscriber may have to handle two to three remote 
controllers, viz. one remote controller for the decoder, one 
remote controller for the TV-apparatus and one remote controller 
for a video set. In case the subscriber also has a CD-player 
with a remote controller he may feel himself somewhat 
confused. Another disadvantage with the decoders as hitherto known 
for TV-systems of the kind as mentioned in the outset is that 
they are normally comparatively bulky and have to be placed 
either on the TV-apparatus or underneath the same, or, of 
course, somewhere else. Sometimes, they are estethically less 
attractive, and their outer appearance does not too seldom 
break with the outer appearance of the TV-apparatus. Still another disadvantage of the decoders as hitherto 
known for TV-systems of the kind as mentioned in the outset is 
that they do normally not permit watching the program on one 
channel while simultaneously recording the program on a different 
channel. The object of the present invention is to provide 
an improved decoder for TV-systems, viz. of the kind where at 
least some of the channels are so called pay-TV-channels, by 
means of which the above mentioned drawbacks are remedied. To the just mentioned end the decoder according to the 
present invention defined in appended claim 1 is characterized essentially in that 
each decoder forms a self-contained unit, which is provided 
with at least one connection means and at least one tap means 
between which are coupled a plurality of decoding blocks which 
are disposed parallel to each other and are adapted to decode 
several channels simultaneously, wherein each block is adapted 
to convert up "its" channel to a UHF-channel of its own, and  
 
wherein each self-contained decoding unit comprises a data 
channel and a control logic for remote control of the individual 
decoding blocks from a central administrative control 
unit. According to the invention it is preferred that the self-contained

<CLAIMS>
A decoding device in TV-systems, and more particularly 
TV-systems of the kind where at least some of the channels are 

so called pay-TV-channels, 
characterized in
 that the decoding 
device (10) forms a self-contained unit, which is provided with at 

least one connection means (11) for connection to a TV antenna and at least one tap means 
(12) for connection to a TV apparatus between a respective pair of which connection means and top means are coupled a plurality of decoding blocks 

(19) which are disposed parallel to each other by having their inputs and outputs connected, respectively, and are thus adapted 
to decode several channels simultaneously, wherein each said decoding block 

is adapted to up convert the frequency spectrum of "its" channel to a UHF-channel of its 
own, ie particularly assigned to it, and wherein the decoding device comprises a 

data channel input (20) coupled to said connection means and a control logic (21) coupled to each 
of the individual decoding blocks for remote control thereof from a central administrative 

control unit. 
A decoder as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
 that 
the decodin
g device (10) also comprises a by-pass means 
(15) connected parallel to said decoding blocks for bypassing uncoded signals from said connection means directly to said top means. 
A decoder as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 
that the decoding device (10) is provided with 

connecting means (13) and tap means (14) for interconnecting an 
ordinary central radio antenna with an ordinary radio antenna cable.
