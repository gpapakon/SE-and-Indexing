<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to light valves and more
particularly to improvements in the liquid suspension of
particles contained within the light valve cell. The liquid
suspension of particles may be used as such as the light
modulating element of a light valve or a plurality of droplets
of the liquid suspension may be encapsulated within a film,
which is then used as the light modulating element of a light
valve.Light valves have been known for almost 60 years for the
modulation of light. In Edwin Land's U.S. Patent No.
1,955,923, the light valve was defined as a cell formed of two
transparent sheets of insulating material spaced apart a small
distance having electrically conductive coatings serving as
electrodes on the inner (facing) surfaces of the sheets, and
containing a "light valve suspension" comprising small 
particles suspended in a liquid suspending medium. As a
practical matter, the light valve suspension also includes a
polymeric stabilizer dissolved in the liquid suspending medium
to prevent agglomeration of the particles. Nitrocellulose was
proposed as a polymeric stabilizer in the beginning of the
development of light valves. More recently, U.S. Patent Nos.
4,164,365 and 4,273,422 and 5 279 773
disclose polymeric stabilizers in the form of
copolymers or a mixture of polymers and/or copolymers.In the absence of an applied electrical field, the
particles in the light valve suspension exhibit random
Brownian movement, and hence a beam of light passing into the
cell is reflected, transmitted or absorbed, depending upon the
nature and concentration of the particles and the energy
content of the light. When an electrical field is applied
through the light valve suspension in the light valve, the
particles become aligned and for many light valve suspensions
a substantial part of the light can pass through the cell.Light valves have been extensively described in the
literature. See U.S. Patent Nos. 1,955,923, 1,963,496,
3,512,876 and 3,773,684. In the early days of television,
Donal, Lagmuir and Goldmark thoroughly investigated the use
of light valves in black and white as well as color 
television. See U.S. Patent Nos. 2,290,582, 2,481,621,
2,528,510 and 2,645,976. A more modern use of the light valve
is an alphanumeric display. Also, active matrix addressed
high information content light valve displays, including flat
color television set replacements for the cathode ray tube,
have been proposed by the assignee of the present invention.
Such displays could function in a manner partly
