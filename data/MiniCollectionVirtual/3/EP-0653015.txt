<ABSTRACT>
An exhaust valve assembly (30) selectively covers an exhaust manifold (42) circumferentially located about a top wall of a cylinder (20) without interfering with segments of a piston (21). The exhaust valve assembly includes a ring-shaped portion (22b) of a cylinder lining which is configured to selectively obstruct air from escaping radially from the top of the cylinder. The exhaust manifold (42) is opened and closed by the lifting of the exhaust valve assembly (30) by a vertical guillotine-type motion. An intake valve assembly (50) is provided on a cylinder head (26) and has a ring or washer shape. The timing of both valves is facilitated by a single spring (100) and induction and exhaust gear-like, planar timing bearings (70, 110). Each of the induction timing bearing (70) and the exhaust timing bearing (110) have a caming surface provided thereon to face the other bearing. The induction timing bearing (70) and the exhaust timing bearing are followed by respective roller tappets (72, 112). The valving and timing arrangement facilitate the flexibility in the design of a combustion chamber (21a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to valves and valve
timing for a cylinder of an internal combustion engine.Opening and closing of valve holes, as well as
the sizes of valve holes, are important considerations in
a four-stroke internal combustion engine.Four valve heads are traditionally arranged
with two suction or intake valves on one side of the
head, and two exhaust valves on the other side of the
head. There have been attempts to alter the placement of
the valves, e.g., placing exhaust valves diagonally
across from one another. These altered valve placement
attempts appear to enhance volumetric efficiency, to
lower interference, and to offer certain thermodynamic
advantages.It was generally believed that four valves in
each cylinder would optimally assure maximum quantity of
air intake. But recently some technicians have taken
issue with the "nothing better than four" credo. For
example, Yamaha developed a five-valve FZ 750 head.
Alejandro De Tommaso developed a six valve head having
three suction valves and three exhaust valves inside a 90
mm circumference.With the conventional multiple valve
arrangements very little of the valve head real estate is
actually devoted to induction of combustible mixture,
particularly since the valve head must also accommodate
exhaust valves (and in a manner without interference). 
Moreover, the exhaust valves protude into the cylinder
and thereby have a tendency to oppose the outflowing of
exhaust gases. Moreover, the exhaust valves (including
the valve stems) are subjected to intense heat as the
exhaust gas escapes.There have been unsuccessful attempts (for
example, the "Knight" engine) to eliminate valves on the
cylinder head, for example by reciprocating sleeves up
and down within a ccylinder lining for the purpose of
selectively opening and closing radial induction and
exhaust ports.US-A-2 937 631 discloses an internal combustion engine in which a conical ring member
is reciprocated inside the combustion cylinder to open and close the communication
between the combustion chamber and an axially extending exhaust channel.FR-A-403 739 discloses a distribution system with concentric valves for internal
combustion engines, which comprises a cylindrical exhaust valve.It is an object of the present
invention to provide a valving arrangement that enhances
volumetric efficiency and improves fuel consumption in an
internal combustion engine.This object is obtained by an internal combustion engine with a valve assembly as defined in
claim 1.According to a preferred embodiment the
