Device (1) for the grooving of tube(s) (2) comprising, 
aligned with the axis (3) of said tube to be grooved (2), a 

holding die (4) intended to hold in position inside said tube 
to be grooved (2) a floating chuck (5) equipped with a rod 

(24) of which the free end carries a grooved chuck (6) and, 
downstream (with respect of the direction of travel of the 

tube to be grooved) of said holding die (4) a grooving unit 
(7) comprising a rotating cage (8) surrounding balls (9) 

intended to compress the wall of said tube (2) against said 
grooved chuck (6) so as to form an internally grooved tube 

(2R) and, downstream of said grooving unit, a finishing die 
(10), as well as means for lubricating the contacting surfaces 

between said balls (9) and said supporting member (11), 
between said balls (9) and the external surface of said tube 

to be grooved (2), and between said balls themselves, 
characterised in that said cage (8) consists of a supporting 

member (11) of which the internal profile (26), in an axial 
section, comprises an arc of a circle (13) forming a track for 

the rolling of said balls and of which the radius of curvature 
is at least equal to that of said balls, and of a closure 

plate (12) for said cage. 
Device according to claim 1, in which, to transmit a 
rotational movement and a compressive stress by support over 

an arc of a circle to said balls (9), said arc of a circle 
(13) and said balls have close radii of curvature, in that the 

radius of curvature of the balls is at most 5% smaller than 
that of said arc of a circle. 
Device according to claim 2, in which said internal 
profile (26) comprises at least one tangential connection 

between one end of said arc of a circle (13) and a straight 
segment.  

 
Device according to claim 3, in which said internal 
profile (26) comprises a so-called "high" tangential 

connection (15h) between said arc of a circle (13) and a 
straight segment (14h) parallel to said axis (3) so as to 

impose predetermined axial spacing on said balls (9). 
Device according to any one of claims 3 and 4 in which 
said internal profile (26) comprises a so-called "low" 

tangential connection (15b) between said arc of a circle (13) 
and a straight segment (14b) forming an angle of between 45 

and 90°, preferably between 70 and 90° with said axis (3). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, in which 
said arc of a circle (13) has 
a span of between 40 and 90°, the 
angle of its bisector with said axis (angle beta) being 

selected so as to correspond substantially to the resultant of 
the stresses of said balls against said supporting member (11) 

for a given speed of travel of said tube (2) and a given speed 
of rotation of said rotating cage (8). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, in which 
said lubricating means comprise a supply of lubricant to the 

downstream base (18) of said balls (9). 
Device according to claim 7, in which said lubricating 
means comprise a supply of lubricant to the upstream base (17) 

of said balls (9). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, in which 
said grooving unit comprises an electromagnetic or mechanical 

stationary rotating spindle (19) setting into rotation a shaft 
(20) connected at one of its ends to said cage (8).  

 
Device according to claim 9, in which said cage (8) is 
located at the upstream end of said shaft (20) (with respect 

to the direction of travel of said tube) and in which said 
supply of lubricant to the downstream base of said balls is 

obtained by means of a device (22) for lubricating said cage 
(8) comprising a co-axial stationary tube (21) having a 

diameter between the external diameter of said tube after 
grooving and the internal diameter of said shaft, the tube 

being supplied with lubricant at its downstream end, its 
upstream end being located at a short distance of a few mm 

from the downstream base (18) of said balls (9). 
Device according to any one of claims 8 to 10, in which 
said supply of lubricant to the upstream base (17) of said 

balls is obtained by means of a device (23) for lubricating 
said holding die (4) upstream and downstream thereof. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 11, in which 
said balls (9), of diameter Db, roll in said cage (8) with 

slight clearance from one another at most equal to 1 mm 
satisfying, in view of the internal diameter Di of the active 

member of said supporting member (11), the external diameter 
De of the grooved tube (2R) and the number of balls n, the 

equation 
arc sine Db/Di = 180/n
, wherein 
Di = De + 2 Db
, in the 
case of zero clearance between balls. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 12, in which 
said closure plate (12) of said cage (8) is selected to 

prevent said balls from leaving said supporting member (11) in 
the upstream axial direction so that said plate (12) is easy 

to connect to said bearing member or to separate from it to 
facilitate the circulation of lubricant in said cage.
