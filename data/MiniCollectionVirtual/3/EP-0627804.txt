<ABSTRACT>
An improved cooling arrangement for a 
dynamoelectric machine of the type having a 

plurality of stacked laminations (20) forming a stator 
core. The stacked laminations (20) have a central bore 

for passage of a rotor (24) therethrough and a plurality 
of uniformly spaced winding slots extending radially 

outward from the bore and terminating at an end at 
least partially through the laminations. Adjacent 

ones of the slots define pole pieces extending from 
the bore into a radially outer portion of the 

laminations. The improvement comprises a plurality 
of cooling air passages (40) extending axially through 

the stacked laminations (20) generally parallel to the 
central bore with each of the air passages being 

positioned adjacent the terminating end of a 
corresponding one of the winding slots. Each air 

passage (40) has a radially outer shape corresponding 
generally to a radially outer shape of the winding 

slots and preferably have a crescent shape when 
viewed axially.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dynamoelectric 
machines and, more particularly, to a stator 
lamination and stator cooling arrangement for such 
machines. Dynamoelectric machines such as rotary electric 
motors are generally provided with some form of 
cooling in order to extend the operating capability 
of the machines. In general, it is desirable to 
maintain the temperature of such machines below a 
predetermined limit in order to prevent 
deterioration of the machine through thermal 
breakdown of insulation or thermal distortion due to 
thermal expansion of elements of the machine. In 
air cooled dynamoelectric machines, air is forced 
through air passages in the stator core as well as 
along surfaces of the rotor and adjacent windings in 
the machine. The air may be forced by external 
means but is generally drawn in through apertures or 
vents in the end bell or caps by a fan coupled in 
driving relationship with a rotating assembly and 
rotor of the machine. Air passages are formed in  
 
the stator core for passage of this cooling air so 
as to carry heat from the machine. In general, the 
stator core air passages are formed as round or oval 
passages adjacent the outer periphery of the stator 
core, as disclosed, for example, in US-A-1761587 and AT-B-41221. As increased horsepower has been demanded from 
such dynamoelectric machines while the physical size 
has been maintained or, in some instances, reduced, 
there has been a concurrent requirement to provide 
more efficient cooling of the machines. Such demand 
and requirement have necessitated development of 
improved cooling without impacting electromagnetic 
design of such machines. Among the several objects of the present 
invention may be noted the provision of an improved 
cooling arrangement for a dynamoelectric machine 
which is achieved without detrimental effect on the 
electromagnetic design of the machine. In one form, 
the improvement is illustrated in an electric motor 
of the 1-5 horsepower class in which the stator 
assembly thereof is formed from a plurality of stack 
laminations, the available horsepower being 
determined by the stack height. The stator 
lamination comprises a generally flat disk having a 
centrally located bore for passage of a rotor 
therethrough. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided 
a stator lamination for a dynamoelectric 
machine comprising a substantially flat disc having a 
centrally located bore with an outer perimeter 
and a plurality of substantially uniformly spaced
