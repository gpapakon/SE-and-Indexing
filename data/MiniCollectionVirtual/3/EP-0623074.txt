<DESCRIPTION>
 REFILL UNIT FOR A WRITING INSTRUMENTThe present invention relates to a refill unit for a writing instrument. Writing instruments, and ball point pens in particular, often incorporate a refill unit. Such a refill unit has a writing tip at one end and paired major and minor ratchet recesses at the opposite end. A pair of fingers provided internally of the writing instrument alternately engage the major and minor recesses of the ratchet on depression of a button on the writing instrument to cause the tip of the refill unit to retract into and extend from the casing of the writing instrument in turn, the action additionally being controlled by a coiled compression spring. Such a ratchet mechanism is shown and. described in EP-A-0252694. Each depression, and release, of the button causes the refill unit to rotate by 90Â° within the casing of the writing instrument. Thus, as users tend always to hold the writing instrument in the same orientation when writing, only two opposite sides of the writing tip of the refill unit are used to write with. This leads to uneven wear of the writing tip which, especially towards the end of the life of the refill, can result in uneven transfer of ink to the paper. According to the present invention, there is provided a refill unit for a writing instrument, the unit having a writing tip at one end and a ratchet mechanism at the other end by means of which the unit can be turned and selectively extended from and retracted into the writing instrument, the ratchet mechanism being rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the unit with respect to the writing tip.By this means, each time the refill unit is extended from or retracted into the writing instrument, the tip rotates by a substantially random amount which ensures a more even distribution of wear on the writing tip. It should be noted that the refill unit cannot rotate whilst 

 writing since the unit is held, as conventionally, by a coiled compression spring.Additionally, it has been found that the invention produces a "click" of lower pitch than that produced by conventional refill units when the refill unit is extended or retracted, the overall sound being less "tinny" and therefore more appealing to the majority of users.Preferably, the rotating portion is constituted by a sleeve which carries recessed cam surfaces of the ratchet mechanism and which is retained for rotation on a post upstanding from the end of the refill unit remote from the writing tip.An example of the present invention will now be described with

CLAIMS
1. A refill unit (1) for a writing instrument, the unit having a writing tip (5) at one end and a ratchet mechanism (7) at the other end by means of which the unit (1) can be turned and selectively extended from and retracted into the writing instrument, the ratchet mechanism (7) being rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the unit with respect to the writing tip (5) .
2. A refill unit according to claim 1, comprising a sleeve (10) which carries recessed cam surfaces (20,21) of the ratchet mechanism and which is retained for rotation on a post (13) upstanding from the end of the refill unit (1) remote from the writing tip (5) .
3. A refill unit according to claim 2, wherein the post is formed on a plug portion (12) of the ratchet mechanism (7) , the plug portion (12) being fitted in a casing (2) of the refill unit (1) .
4. A refill unit according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the refill unit (1) has a shank portion (4) carrying the writing tip (5) , the shank portion having a constant diameter throughout its length.
