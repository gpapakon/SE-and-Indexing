<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rapid assay for the determination of drug residues in fresh meat or livestock. The assay allows the determination of results in approximately 90 minutes thus allowing certification of drug-free carcases before they enter the food chain. The assay in an immunometric assay using chromogenic or chemiluminescent labels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the rapid detection of 
veterinary drug residues in fresh meat or livestock and to a test kit 
for use in such a method. The illegal use of certain veterinary drugs has resulted in the 
development of a flourishing illicit market in these drugs which in 
turn presents a potential hazard for the consumer of produce from 
treated animals. Steers are traditionally used in the beef industry rather than 
bulls. Steers are less efficient, they grow 10% slower and have more 
fat and poorer conformation than bulls. Thus, beef producers used 
anabolic agents to increase growth before they were banned. However, 
since the EC ban in 1987, there have been varying allegations of 
illegal use of prohibited production enhancers in beef cattle. The 
possibility that a significant portion of beef might have residues of 
illegal growth enhancers could threaten consumption of beef. Mandatory testing by national authorities of fresh meat, in 
compliance with EC Directives, covers a range of veterinary medicines 
and banned substances.  
 An enzyme immunoassay screening for synthetic anabolic estrogens and 
androgens is known from Degand et al (Journal of Chromotography, 489 
(1989) p235-234). The assay is an enzyme immunoassay involving 
either horseraddish peroxidase or Beta-lactamase, which is conducted 
on bovine urine to detect diethylstilbestrol, nortestosterone, 
methyltestosterone and trenbolone. High-performance liquid 
chromatography following immunoaffinity pre-treatment to determine 
nortestosterone levels in biological samples is known from Haasnoot 
(Journal of Chromotography, 489 (1989) p157-171). The analytical test protocol of the present invention represents a 
new approach to surveillance of fresh meat for drug residues. The 
approach has been to apply rapid clinical diagnostic techniques to 
veterinary drug residue analysis. This has the potential to permit 
large numbers of samples to be processed rapidly and much more 
cheaply than is currently the case. This approach permits the 
monitoring of large numbers of animals as they pass through abattoirs 
and offers the possibility of "Carcase Quality Certification (CQC) " 
before the carcase is allowed to enter the food chain. The invention provides a series of semi-automated tests for a range 
of veterinary drugs, such as 'Angel Dust' (the Beta-Agonists-Clenbuterol, 
Salbutamol, Terbutaline etc), and for illegal hormonal 
growth promoters (Zeranol, Trenbolone, Stilbenes etc). The object of the invention is to

<CLAIMS>
A method for the rapid detection of drug residues in fresh meat 
comprising taking a bile sample from livestock, reacting the sample 

in a competitive immunometric assay utilising a labelled antibody, 
the antibody being labelled with a chromogenic or chemiluminescent 

label, the bile sample being cleaned prior to immunometric assay by 
passage under vacuum through a porous silica immunoaffinity column 

having an immobilised antibody capable of binding the drug to be 
detected, the column being washed free of impurities and any drug 

being bound to the column being eluted with a suitable solvent. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the antibody 
is an anti-clenbuterol antibody. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the antibody is an 
anti-zeranol antibody. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the 
immunometric assay is a competitive assay in which a solid support is 

pre-coated with a carrier protein-drug conjugate, the sample and an 
anti-drug antibody raised in a first species are added to the solid 

support, allowed to react and the support washed, a labelled 
anti-first species antibody raised in a second species is added, 

allowed to react and the support washed, a signal reagent is added 
and the signal read. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein the label is horseradish 
peroxidase. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 wherein the carrier 
protein is thyroglobulin. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 4 to 6 wherein the antibody 
raised in the first species is a rabbit anti-drug antibody and the 

antibody raised in the second species is a donkey anti-rabbit 
antibody.  

 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim which is an enhanced 
chemiluminescence assay. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the steps are 
automated, being performed by robots.
