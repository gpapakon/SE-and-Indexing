Quadrangular sewing machine for the manufacture of 
hollow manufactured cardboard products, especially 

boxes, from a sheet of cardboard (1) opportunely cut 
out with a hollow punch and scored, comprising means 

for feeding the machine with the said sheet (1), a 
former (7) supported by a corresponding former-carrying 

rod and designed to be positioned inside the box during 
its formation, four angular operating heads (10) with 

corresponding centripetal horizontal drive means for 

pressing and cutting a heat-welding tape (12) at high 
temperature suitable for sewing, that is to say joining 

together, the corners of the box to be formed, means 
for driving the said former (7), means for adjusting 

the said feeding means in relation to the size of the 
sheet fed by them, a central unit with programmable 

microprocessors for controlling the aforementioned 
driving, feeding and adjustment means,
 
characterised in that 


the said means for feeding the machine with cardboard 
sheets (1) to be formed comprises a horizontal panel 

(2) for supporting the chamfered cardboard sheets (1), 
slaved to a vertical movement between a lower position 

of rest and an upper plane for the loading of sheets 
(1), and a carriage (6) with a telescopic structure for 

moving the sheets (1) thus fed forward so as to place 
them in a position underlying the former (7) so as to 

allow the successive sewing thereof by means of the 
operating heads (10); the carriage (6) being able to be 

actuated with a variable travel in relation to the size 
of each sheet (1) and being associable with an 

actuating cylinder (20), whose rod is connected to the 
belt of the carriage (6) in order to produce the  

 
correct tension in relation to the length of the actual 

travel of the carriage (6); 
the said drive means comprises an actuating cylinder 
(11) for each head (10) to be moved with a travel of 

variable length; 
the said adjustment means for changing size comprises 
several electric motors (16, 17) slaved to the said 

central unit and connected to the base of each 
operating head (10); 
the machine comprises means for adjusting the 
operating travel of the carriage (6). 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
said panel (2) is driven by means of an electric motor 

(200) slaved to the said central unit, so as to 
transfer each sheet (1) to be formed into the 

underlying position and opposite sucker means (3) 
suitable for taking off and retaining the sheet (1) for 

a predetermined time. 
Machine according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
said suckers (3) are supported by a horizontal bar 

connected to a lever system (4) actuated by an 
actuating cylinder (5) for enabling each sheet (1) to 

be introduced between two corresponding opposite drive 
rollers (100). 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
said carriage (6) is actuated by means of a central 

belt slaved to a corresponding electric motor (18) 
which is controlled by the said central unit, so as to 

facilitate the progress of the sheet (1) until the 
predetermined stop stage, with a travel which is 

variable according to the programme in relation to its  
 

size, and so as to place the sheet (1) in a position 
underlying the former in order to allow the successive 

sewing thereof by the operating heads (10). 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
said adjustment means comprises a ballscrew, which is 

controlled by an electric motor with an encoder and 
slaved to the central unit, and passing through a nut 

fixed to the mobile part of the carriage (6). 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
means of driving the said former-carrying rod comprises 

a vertical fixed hollow body (9) within which there is 
housed a belt closed with a link (90), actuated by a 

motor (8) and connected to the former-carrying rod with 
a flange element (92): the former-carrying rod being 

provided with linear guide elements (93) sliding on a 
ball-bearing carriage (92) and the said electric motor 

(8) being of the brushless type and slaved to the said 
central microprocessor unit, to obtain on command, 

depending on the program, the driving of the former (7) 
from and towards the working surface of the four 

operating heads (10) which provide for the sewing of 
the box with the heat-welding tape (12), and with a 

travel of variable length and speed in relation to the 
size of the box to be sewn. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
said former-carrying rod is made from a light extruded 

alloy. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises four electric motors (16, 17) slaved to the 

said central unit, two of which (16) are connected, 
with endless screws and the corresponding nuts, to the 

base of the corresponding operating heads (10) so as to 
cause, by way of a programmed command related to the  

 
size of the sheet (1), the movement in the longitudinal 

direction of the machine, and the other two motors (17) 
are connected, in the same manner, to the base of two 

other operating heads (10), so as to cause, by way of a 
programmed command related to the size of the sheet 

(1), the movement in the transverse direction of the 
machine. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises an electro-brake (21) for achieving the 

immediate stoppage of the former-carrying rod, and 
thereby preventing the spontaneous movement thereof, in 

the case of an electric power failure or other 
operating abnormalities. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
said former-carrying rod is hollow. 
Machine according to Claims 1 and 10, characterised in 
that it comprises means for extracting the sewn box 

from the former (7), with an actuating cylinder (120) 
whose rod passes inside the said former-carrying rod.
