<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communications circuits, and
especially to maintenance termination units for use in telephone
circuits.In recent years, and especially in view of deregulation of
many telephone systems, privately owned communication
equipment has increasingly been installed in the premises of
subscribers to the system, with the result that it is often necessary
to determine whether any fault is located in the telephone line, or
in the subscriber's premises, i.e. in the subscriber's equipment or
cabling, in order to determine whose responsibility it is to repair
the fault. It is highly advantageous economically if this
determination can be performed remotely by sending an
appropriate signal from the local exchange along the line, thereby
obviating the necessity to send any telephone company personnel
to the subscriber's premises.In order to test the telephone line for any faults it is
necessary firstly to install a so-called "maintenance termination
unit" or MTU in the line at the subscriber's premises which can
disconnect the subscriber equipment from the line (often called
sectionalizing the line) and connect the a and b or tip and ring
lines on receipt of the appropriate signals from the exchange.
During the line testing procedure determinations will typically be
made of the line to line resistance and of the first and second line
to ground resistance. Also the line continuity can be determined
by detecting the presence of the MTU electronically.Various forms of MTU are described, for example, in US
Patent No 4.710,949 to Om Ahuja. This device comprises a pair of
voltage sensitive switches, one located in each of the tip and ring 
lines, and a distinctive termination connecting the tip and ring
lines on the subscriber side of the voltage-sensitive 
switches. The voltage-sensitive switches may each have a threshold voltage
of about 16 volts so that they are closed in normal operation by the 48 volt battery
voltage but will open when this is replaced by a test voltage below about 32 volts in
order to test the line-to-ground and tip-to-ring impedances. The distinctive
termination may, for example, comprise a back-to-back diode and Zener diode which
will exhibit an asymmetric resistance when large voltages (higher than the operating
voltages) of different polarity are applied.In addition to the provision of an MTU in a communications system, the
system will normally need to be protected against overcurrents and also overvoltages
in the communications channel which may, for example be caused by

<CLAIMS>
A switching arrangement that can be connected in a communications channel
comprising a pair of lines, between sets of terminal equipment, which comprises :


(i) a pair of series switching devices (2), each of which can be series connected in
one of the lines and which can be remotely activated by a test signal sent along

the channel;
(ii) at least one shunt switching circuit (4) connected between the lines or between
one or both of the lines and earth;

charactised in that the series switching devices (2) are switching circuits which are
adapted to be opened when subjected to an overcurrent in its associated line, and the shunt

switching circuit (4) is adapted to be closed when subjected to an overvoltage in its
associated line and can be remotely activated by means of a test signal sent

along the channel.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, wherein each series switching circuit
comprises a switching transistor (T1, T2, T3) whose base or gate voltage is controlled

by an overcurrent control element (T4), the overcurrent control element switching on
when the switching circuit is subjected to an overcurrent, thereby switching the

switching transistor off.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 2, wherein the overcurrent control
element (T4) is a transistor, the base or gate terminal of which is held in a voltage

divider (R2, R3) that spans the series switching circuit so that its base-emitter or gate-source
voltage increases with the current in the line.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, wherein each series
switching circuit includes a test control element (T5) that also controls the base or

gate voltage of the switching transistor, the test control element (T5) turning on in
response to the test signal.
An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, which includes a d.c.
voltage window detector circuit (3) that is connected between the lines and will allow

a current to flow through it when, and only when, the voltage between the lines is 
within a predetermined band, the current flowing through the window detector circuit

actuating the switching circuits.
An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the shunt
switching circuit (4) will connect the lines via a distinctive termination when actuated

by the test signal.
An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the shunt
switching circuit comprises a triac (TR1) connected between the lines.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 5, wherein the window detector circuit is
coupled to the switching circuit(s) via an optoelectronic coupler (OPTO 1,2,3).
An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein each series
switching circuit includes a capacitor (C2) connected to an input terminal of the test

control transistor (T5), the capacitor being charged during actuation of the switching
circuits (2) by the d.c signal and holding the switching circuit open for a period of

time after termination of the actuating d.c. signal.
An array of arrangements as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9 that are
connected in a communications channel in order to divide the channel into sections for

locating a fault, each arrangement having a different d.c. voltage actuation window
from the or each other arrangement.
