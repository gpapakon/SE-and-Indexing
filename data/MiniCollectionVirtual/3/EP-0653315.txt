<ABSTRACT>
A hub assembly for a driven wheel of a vehicle comprises a 
bearing unit, provided with a rotary inner ball race (6), and a 

homokinetic coupling (2) fixed to the inner ball race (6). In order to 
improve the fixing, a separate connection piece is provided 

which interacts with inner ball race and coupling. Preferably, 
the connection piece interacts with inner ball race (6) and 

coupling by means of non-circular shapes (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hub assembly for a driven wheel of a 
vehicle, which hub comprises a bearing unit, provided with a rotary 
inner ball race and a homokinetic coupling cooperating with the inner 
ball race by means of a separate connection piece and pretensioning 
means in engagement with said connection piece for holding the bearing 
unit and coupling pressed against one another. Such a hub assembly is known from GB-A-2191267. The inner ball 
race of said hub assembly is accommodated on a hub member, which by 
means of splines cooperates with the coupling. Fixing by means of 
splines has the disadvantage that it is expensive, and that the hub 
assembly becomes rather heavy. The aim of the invention is, therefore, to provide a hub assembly 
which does not have these disadvantages. This aim is achieved in that 
the connection piece comprises a connecting bush on which the 
pretensioning means engage, which connection bush interacts with inner 
ball race and coupling by means of non-circular shapes.  
 The connection piece and the inner surfaces of inner 
ball race and coupling can be of a simple shape, that is to say 
without splines, so that they can be manufactured 
inexpensively, for example by means of pressing. The connection piece can have an outwards-facing flange 
which is in contact with a contact face of the coupling which 
faces away from the bearing unit, pretensioning means which 
interact with the connection piece being provided to hold 
bearing unit and coupling pressed against one another via said 
flange under axial pretension. The maintenance of a certain  
 
pretension in the fixing between inner ball race and coupling 
is important for play-free transmission of differing stresses. In this context it is advantageous if, in the axial 
direction, inner ball race and coupling are held clamped 
against one another by means of the connection piece and a bolt 
which bears against the latter. Preferably, the head of the bolt is in contact with a 
contact face of the bearing unit which faces away from the 
coupling, and the shank of the bolt is screwed into a nut which 
interacts with the connection piece. According to a first possibility, the nut is integral 
with the connection piece; according to a second possibility, 
the nut is accommodated in a connecting bush and bears against 
an inwards-facing flange of the connecting bush. In order to obtain the requisite flexibility in the 
connection, a compression body of resilient material, such as 
rubber, can be provided between the
