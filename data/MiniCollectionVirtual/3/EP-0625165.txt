<DESCRIPTION>
 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY TO CELL SURFACE PROTEIN OF THE BACTERIUMNEISSERIA MENINGITIDISBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention involves a monoclonal antibody (Mab) with the specificity for a 20,000 dalton cell surface protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a cell line that produces said antibody, and the partially purified 20,000 dalton cell surface protein.N. meningitidis is one of the leading causes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis, causing 19.6% of reported cases in the United States between 1978-1981. Meningococcal meningitis is most prevalent among infants between 6-12 months and adolescents. In addition to meningococemia, other less commonly associated diseases such as, conjunctivitis, sinusitis, endocartitis and primary pneumoniae can also occur.Neisseria meningitidis bacteria are carried in the nasopharynx of 10-15% of healthy individuals. In spite of th high carriage rate, its presence does not necessarily imply infection. However, if N. meningitidis is isolated in cerebral spinal fluid or blood culture, its detection is significant.Detection of this bacteria at an early stage is essential to facilitate treatment of the infection. Thus, i is important to possess the ability to identify whether N. meningitidis is present in a patient and to follow the effec 

of antibiotic treatment on the bacteria. As available immunoassays for N. meningitidis antigen detection have shown lack of specificity and/or sensitivity, there remains the need for an improved method of such detection.N. meningitidis is a gram negative bacteria.Proteins located on the cell surface of many gram negative bacteria have, in the past, been used in typing and immunoprotective studies. There are a large number of N. meningitidis strains, and there are many cell surface proteins associated with N. meningitidis. This has made identification of a common but exclusive cell surface antigen difficult. However, Mab technology has provided researchers with tools t accurately analyze the cell surface components of N. meningitidis. In addition, . meningitidis proteins are of interest to the epode iologists as they may provide for vaccines against the bacteria.Meningococcal vaccines have been developed using capsular polysacharrides . One particular quadravalent vaccin incorporates polysacharride antigens of serogroups A,C, and Y, eningococci that are responsible for less than 49% of meningococcal disease in the United States. The most prevalent N. meningitidis serogroup is serogroup B. No capsular polysacharride vaccine is
