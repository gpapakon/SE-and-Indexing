<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyamide 
resin composition, and an article formed from the 
composition including a tank, tube, and the like. More 
particularly, it relates to a polyamide resin composition 
useful for the production of articles which have a 
lower tensile modulus as well as excellent oil resistance 
(especially, anti-gasoline fume permeability), 
thermal resistance, hydrolysis resistance, chemical 
resistance, moldability (especially, mold releasing 
property), impact resistance, etc., and to articles 
which are formed from the composition, the articles 
including gasoline tubes, hoses, packings, cams, gears, 
and the like. Recently, various multi-component resin 
compositions having a higher degree of impact resistance 
have been developed as a result of advanced research 
of polymer blends. In general, compositions 
comprising a polyamide resin, and an olefin polymer or 
a styrene polymer which is blended therewith are known 
as nylons. These nylons have a higher degree of impact 
resistance or a lower water-absorbing property, and 
include, for example, compositions of nylons and polypropylenes, 
compositions of nylons and ABS resins, 
compositions of nylons and polypropylene rubbers, and 
the like. However, because polyamide resins have a 
higher tensile modulus, articles having excellent 
flexibility cannot be obtained from these polyamide 
resin compositions.  In order to reduce the tensile modulus of the 
polyamide resin, polyamide elastomers, polyamide urethane 
copolymers, and the like have been prepared by 
block copolymerization of a polyamide (nylon 6, nylon 
12, aromatic polyamides, etc.) as a hard segment and a 
polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG), polypropylene 
glycol (PPG), aliphatic polyester diol or the like as a 
soft segment. Although these resins have a lower 
tensile modulus, they provide insufficient thermal 
resistance and oil resistance (especially, anti-gasoline 
fume permeability). Also, polyamide resin compositions comprising 
a polyamide resin and a thermoplastic polyurethane 
resin, which is blended therewith to reduce its tensile 
modulus, are known in the art. However, in general, 
the thermoplastic polyurethane resin constitutes a 
continuous phase in the polyamide resin composition 
when a relatively large amount of the polyurethane 
resin is blended for sufficient reduction of tensile 
modulus, and therefore provides some disadvantages due 
to the thermoplastic polyurethane resin. For example, 
the significant reduction of oil resistance
