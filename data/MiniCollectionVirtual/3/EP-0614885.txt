<ABSTRACT>
The alkyl groups of dialkyl trisulfides are exchanged with 
the alkyl groups of mercaptans by reacting a tertiary 

dialkyl trisulfide with an alkyl mercaptan having a greater 
number of carbon atoms in its alkyl group than said 

trisulfide in the presence of an acidic or basic type 
catalyst for a time and a temperature sufficient to produce 

a dialkyl trisulfide having at least one transferred alkyl 
group from said mercaptan.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a process for the facile 
transfer of alkyl groups between dialkyltrisulfides and 
alkyl mercaptans. More particularly, it concerns the 
catalytically induced transfer of one or more tertiary 
alkyl groups between a di-tertiary alkyl trisulfide and a 
mercaptan having a higher alkyl group to thereby produce 
dialkyl trisulfides incorporating transferred alkyl groups 
and having utility as extreme pressure additives in 
lubricating compositions.  The reaction of ethyl mercaptan with diethyl 
trisulfide catalyzed by piperidine was reported in the 
literature [M. B. Evans and B. Saville, Proceedings Chem. 
Soc., 18-19 (1962)] to give two moles of diethyl disulfide 
and one mole of piperidinium hydrosulfide. These same 
authors also reported that isopropyl mercaptan reacted with 
1,3-dimethylbut-2-enyl trisulfide in the presence of 
piperidine produced only traces of diisopropyl trisulfides 
and gave mainly 1,3-dimethylbut-2-enyl isopropyl disulfide, 
diisopropyl disulfide and 1,3-dimethylbut-2-ene-1-thiol per 
mole of initial trisulfide. A related reaction was reported by L.A. Gillette and 
L.R. Martin in U.S. Pat. 3,299,146 wherein methyl mercaptan 
is reacted with dimethyl trisulfide in the presence of 
triethylamine catalyst to give dimethyl disulfide and 
hydrogen sulfide as shown below. 
   This prior art leads away from the present invention 
wherein mercaptans react with dialkyl trisulfides in the 
presence of basic catalysts, to give a variety of 
disulfides that incorporate the starting mercaptan alkyl 
moiety. This invention is a process for the transfer of alkyl 
groups comprising reacting a di-tertiary c₄₋₁₂ alkyl 
trisulfide with a C₅₋₂₀ alkyl mercaptan where the mercaptan  
 
contains a greater number of carbon atoms than an alkyl 
group of the trisulfide, in the presence of an effective 
amount of an acidic or basic type catalyst at a temperature 
and for a time sufficient to produce a dialkyl trisulfide 
having at least one transferred alkyl group from said 
mercaptans. The invention also is in a composition of 
matter which is a mixture of asymmetric and symmetric 
dialkyl trisulfides. The process of this invention involves the 
transference of tertiary (t)-alkyl groups from a trisulfide 
reactant and an alkyl group from a mercaptan reactant. The 
trisulfide is a di-t-alkyl trisulfide or a di-t-alkyl 
higher sulfur rank polysulfide where the polysulfide may 
dissociate under the conditions of this reaction resulting 
in the presence of di-t-alkyl trisulfide. The
