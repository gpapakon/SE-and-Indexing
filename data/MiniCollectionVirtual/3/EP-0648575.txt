<ABSTRACT>
A polishing apparatus is a cluster type of apparatus 
having a plurality of units to deal with various works. The 

polishing apparatus includes a universal transfer robot (10) having 
at least one arm for transferring a workpiece, a plurality of 

units disposed around the universal transfer robot and 
including a loading unit (11) for placing thereon the workpiece (S) to 

be polished, at least one polishing unit (13,14) for polishing the 
workpiece, at least one washing unit (15) for washing the workpiece 

which has been polished and an unloading unit (12) for placing 
thereon the cleaned workpiece. The polishing apparatus further 

includes an exclusive transferring device (13-3,14-3) for transferring 
the workpiece between two units of the plurality of units adjacent 

to each other. The universal transfer robot transfers a clean 
workpiece and the exclusive transferring device transfers a 

dirty workpiece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polishing
apparatus, and more particularly to a polishing apparatus which
has a polishing unit for polishing a workpiece such as a
semiconductor wafer, a washing unit for washing the workpiece
which has been polished and a universal transfer robot for
transferring the workpiece.Recent rapid progress in semiconductor device
integration demands smaller and smaller wiring patterns or
interconnections and also narrower spaces between
interconnections which connect active areas. One of the
processes available for forming such interconnection is
photolithography. Though the photolithographic process can
form interconnections that are at most 0.5 Âµm wide, it requires
that surfaces on which pattern images are to be focused on by
a stepper be as flat as possible because the depth of focus of
the optical system is relatively small.It is therefore necessary to make the surfaces of
semiconductor wafers flat for photolithography. One customary
way of flattening the surfaces of semiconductor wafers is to
polish them with a polishing apparatus.Conventionally, such a polishing apparatus has a
single function of polishing a semiconductor wafer. Therefore,
in case of washing a semiconductor wafer after polishing, the
semiconductor wafer is required to be transferred or 
transported from the polishing apparatus to a washing
apparatus. Further, in case of polishing a semiconductor wafer
again under a different condition after polishing, the
semiconductor wafer is required to be transferred or
transported from one polishing apparatus to another polishing
apparatus. In these cases, the semiconductor wafers are
manually transferred or transported by a movable container in
which they are immersed in water to keep them from drying
during transportation. However, since various apparatuses
including a polishing apparatus and a washing apparatus are
independently installed and the semiconductor wafers are
transferred or transported by the movable container containing
water therein, it is difficult to install the polishing
apparatus, the washing apparatus and the like in a clean room
of a semiconductor manufacturing plant and to automate various
processes including a polishing process and a washing process
completely.In order to solve the above problems, there has been
proposed an apparatus which has a polishing unit and a washing
unit housed in a common housing. Further, if necessary, there
is a possibility that a plurality of polishing units are housed
in a common housing.In the polishing
