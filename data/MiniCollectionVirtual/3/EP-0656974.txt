A universal pole anchoring device (10) for supporting utility poles (12) vertically over a hard surface (13) such as rock, concrete or the like is disclosed. The device (10) comprises a harness assembly (11) connected about a base section (12') of a pole (12) to be supported on the hard surface (13). The harness (11) is secured by bolts (14) all about the base section. The harness assembly (11) is comprised of harness members each defined by an anchor bolt attachment pipe (15) having a pair of pole engaging clamps (16, 16') connected thereto in spaced alignment. The clamps (16, 16') support the attachment pipe (15) spaced from and at an outwardly depending angle when the harness is secured to a pole (12). The harness assembly (11) also has a predetermined number of harness members interconnected by the connecting bolts (14) about the base section (12') and dependent on the diameter of the pole. An anchor bolt assembly (18) is connectable to each of the attachment pipes (15) of the harness members to anchor the harness assembly in the hard surface (13) to support the pole (12) vertically thereover.

<DESCRIPTION>
 UNIVERSAL POLE ANCHORING DEVICE TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a universal pole anchoring device for supporting utility poles, of different diameters, vertically over a hard surface, such as rock, concrete or the like, and wherein a plurality of such anchoring devices are interconnected in a harness assembly about a base section of a pole and with anchor bolts extending into the ground surface at an outward angle outwardly spaced from the pole to provide increased anchoring strength.BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONIn U.S. Patent Nos. 4,218,858 and 4,248,025 there is described a pole anchoring system which is strapped about a lower portion of a wooden pole to support the pole vertically over a hard surface, such as rock, concrete or the like. These patents disclose various pole anchoring devices to attach to anchor bolts which are secured in bore holes drilled vertically within the ground surface about the pole. The anchor bolts are positioned quite closely to the pole to be secured to the anchoring devices which are attached to the pole. With these pole anchoring devices it has been necessary to provide harnesses of different sizes to fit wood poles of different diameters. Accordingly, it is necessary to carry large inventories of these anchoring devices including anchor bolt of different dimensions and lengths to adapt to poles of different sizes. Further, because the anchor bore holes are spaced close to the poles, it is necessary to anchor these bolts at a suitable depth to ensure proper anchoring.SUMMARY OF INVENTIONIt is a feature of the present invention to provide a universal pole anchoring device whichSUBSTITUTESHEET 

substantially overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages by providing a common harness member which may be used in an assembly of a certain number of these members to support poles of different diameters vertically over a hard ground surface.Another feature of the present invention is to provide a universal pole anchoring device which is used in a harness assembly comprising a plurality of these anchoring devices and wherein the anchor bolts are supported spaced from a pole to be supported by the harness assembly and wherein the anchor bolts are disposed in a cone configuration about a base portion of the pole to provide increased anchoring strength in the ground against overturning forces and permitting the bore holes to be drilled shallower than the prior art.Another feature of the present invention is to provide a universal pole anchoring device for use in a harness
