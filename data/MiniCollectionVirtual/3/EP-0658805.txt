<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic
light-sensitive material which has a high-sensitivity
and little dye stain, and which is excellent in sharpness
as well as in aging stability, and more particularly to a
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material for medical
radiographic use.With regard to the processing of silver halide photographic
light-sensitive materials, there has lately been a growing
demand for shortening the processing time and reducing
the discharge of waste processing solutions. In the
medical field, for example, there has been a sharply increasing
number of medical examinations, including general diagnoses and treatments, 
attributed to the recently widespread regular medical
checkups and complete physical examinations anyone can
undergo hospital in, and therefore the number of X-ray
films to be radiographed and processed vastly increases, thus
leading to a growing demand for the realization of techniques
for super-rapidly processing radiographed films and for reducing
the amount of waste processing solutions discharged at the
time of the processing.In order to speed up the processing, it is necessary to
shorten each of the developing, fixing, washing and drying
periods of time, but it results in the increase in the load in
each processing step. For example, if the developing time is
merely shortened, in the case of a conventional light-sensitive
material, it causes the image density to lower, resulting
in a drop in sensitivity and in the deterioration of image gradation.
Where the fixing time is shortened, incomplete fixation of
the silver halide can be achieved to cause the resulting image
quality to be degraded. Further, the processing time shortening
makes the sensitizing dye's elution incomplete in each of
the developing, fixing and washing steps to thus cause the
resulting image to be degraded with a residual dye stain.
Accordingly, the solution to the above problems requires the
speedup of the developing and fixing rates, the reduction in
the amount of sensitizing dyes, and the acceleration of the
elution and/or decoloration of the sensitizing dye. On the other hand, the reduction in the discharge amount
of waste processing solutions needs to make each processing
solution less exhaustible and/or less replenishable, but is
accompanied with the same problems as in the above speedup
case.To solve the above problems, EP0506,584, Japanese Patent
Publication Open to Public Inspection (hereinafter abbreviated
to JP O.P.I.) Nos. 88293/1993 and 93975/1993
