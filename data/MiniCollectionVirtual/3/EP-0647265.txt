<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for applying a liquid sample onto a culture medium in a spiral shape, for example for determining the bacteria concentration therein, comprises a line having an inclined nozzle for applying said liquid sample onto the culture medium. A turntable supports a culture medium container, and said line being supported by a linearly movable slide. Automatic means are arranged for adjusting said nozzle and turntable relative to each other by depending on the level of the upper surface of the culture medium by means of a sensor. An automatically controlled movement mechanism together with a level control device for a desinfectant container insures that the nozzle is submerged deep enough into the desinfectant to properly desinfect the outer side of the nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
applying a liquid sample onto a culture medium with a prescribed
quantity and distribution, comprising a syringe, a
movable nozzle connected to the syringe through a line, a
table for a culture medium container, a container for sample
liquid, a container for desinfectant, and a control system and
movement mechanism for displacing the nozzle.In a prior art apparatus of this type, as is e.g.
known from US Patents 3,799,844; 3,892,632 and 3,962,040, the
sample liquid is applied in a spiral shape onto a so-called
agar culture medium. The agar culture medium is applied to the
culture medium container, such as a Petri dish, as uniformly
as possible and with a prescribed thickness. However, in
practice this thickness varies several millimeters. As a
result thereof the accurate angular positioning of the nozzle
resting on the culture medium is complicated.Furthermore, problems may arise in the prior art
apparatus because the manual desinfection of the line and the
nozzle are not carried out properly, which may cause cross-infections
of samples.The object of the invention is to provide an
apparatus, in which the disadvantages as described are removed
in an effective way.According to a first aspect the apparatus according
to the invention is characterized by means for automatically
ensuring the nozzle of the line to be submerged deeper into
the desinfectant than into the sample liquid by means of the
movement mechanism.In this way, a full cleaning operation of the nozzle
is ensured and contamination of samples is prevented in a
reliable way. In an advantageous embodiment and for this
purpose said means comprises an automatic supply of desinfectant
from a reservoir to the container thereof for
maintaining a minimum level therein, and preferebly the nozzle
is reciprocable up and down by means of a movement mechanism
for moving it into and out of the desinfectant.A further measurement for preventing samples in the
apparatus to be infected or contaminated is that, in which the
volume of the line and nozzle up to the syringe is larger 
than the volume of the sample liquid, which can maximally be
applied. Due to this measure it is impossible for the sample
liquid to arrive in the syringe itself when it is sucked in by
means of the syringe, in which desinfection is more difficult
than within the line. Consequently the risk of infections is
substantially reduced in this manner.According to a second aspect the invention provides
an apparatus for applying a liquid sample
