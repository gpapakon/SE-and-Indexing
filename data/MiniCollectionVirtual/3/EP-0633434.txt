<ABSTRACT>
Heating apparatus, specifically adapted for caravans and similar mobile housings 
with small spaces for producing both central heat and tap water. The heat source 

is a burner 
combusting LP-gas or similar, alternatively heat cartridges for electric heating. 

The burner is 
operating in a cylindrical space consisting of a burner tube (11) 

with several radial flanges (17), which 
conduct the heat energy outwards to a ring-shaped space (12), outwards 

delimited by a second 
tube (3). The heat medium for central heating is positioned in 

the ring-shaped space (12). A tube-shaped 
vessel (2) for tap water surrounds the ring-shaped space. The tap water 

vessel (2), the 
second tube (3) and the burner tube (11) are lying cylinders 

eccentrically positioned inside each 
other. The burner tube (11) is closed at one end and is provided 

with a baffle (28) dividing the tube in 
an upper portion, in which the very burner is positioned, and a lower 

portion for returning 
the combustion gases. An exhaust line is connected to the lower portion 

of the burner tube 
for giving off the combustion gases to the surroundings. The heating 

apparatus can be used 
at water supported as well as air supported central heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heater for providing central heating and hot water
(tap water) in a caravan, house car, camping boat or similar.In the Swedish Patent Specification No. 7804976-4, there is described a heater for
caravans or similar moveable housing. The hot combustion gases from a LP-burner or
similar is adapted to pass a heat exchanger in the shape of a tube with radial flanges. The
flanges extend outside the surface of the tube, where a heat medium is positioned enclosed
inside a second concentric tube. The heat medium is used for central heating and is fed to
radiators of the caravan. Outside the second tube, there may be a spiral comprising further
heat medium which is used for hot tap water. This equipment is positioned in a housing with
relatively small cross-sectional area but a large height. In this manner a relatively compact
equipment is formed.In the French Patent Specification No. 1460368 there is described a heater intended
for a small house or other larger permanent housing. The heater comprises a laying tap water
cylinder with a volume of for example 1200 litres. A burner is positioned inside a second
cylindrical tube, which is positioned eccentrically at the lower part of the tap water cylinder.
The tube of the burner is provided with radial flanges for taking up heat energy from the
burner. A third tube is positioned concentric outside the burner tube and encloses a heat
medium for central heating used for heating the housing via radiators etc. The third tube is
provided with flanges extending out in the tap water cylinder for improving the heat transfer.GB-A-2 257 242 discloses a water and air heating apparatus which conductively
heats air and water simultaneously by means of a hollow heat exchanger disposed in a tank
and controls the relative rates of heating of the air and water by means of a control system
which controls a fan impelling the air through the heat exchanger. The heat is provided by a
burner positioned in a burner tube with radial flanges transmitting heat to a second concentric
space for heating air therein.The object of the present invention is to provide a heating apparatus which is
specifically adapted for caravans and similar mobile housings with small spacings and thus
is very compact. Another object of the invention is to provide a heating apparatus for heating
air for central heating as well as water for tap water supply.Thus, there is provided a heating apparatus for heating tap water and for central
heating of a mobile house such as a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Heating apparatus for heating tap water and for central heating of a mobile
house such as a caravan, comprising:


a burner (36) as a heat source, the burner being positioned in a burner tube (21);
a second tube (3) surrounding said burner tube and forming a ring-shaped space
(22) between the burner tube and the second tube, said ring-shaped space containing air

for central heating; and
a tap water vessel (4) surrounding said ring-shaped space,
said burner tube (21) comprising radial flanges (20) extending from the interior
of the burner tube (21) and through the surface thereof to the ring-shaped space (22) for

heat exchange with and heating of the air for central heating;

   
characterized
 in that

said tap water vessel (4) and said second tube (3) are lying cylinders; and in that
the second tube (3) is provided with a heat transferring plate (23) covering a

predetermined part of the lower portion of said second tube (3), the flanges (20) of the
burner tube being in contact with said hea
t transferring plate (23).
Heating apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
flanges (20) do not reach up to the surface of the second tube (3) at the portion of the

second tube which is not covered by the heat transferring plate.
Heating apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that heat
transmitting means, such as a heat transferring paste, is provided between the second

tube (3) and the heat transferring plate (23).
Heating apparatus according to anyone of the previous claims,

characterized
 in that the tap water vessel (4) is surrounded by a cover (24),
comprising inlet holes (25) for the central heating air at the upper portion of the tap water

vessel (4), and that inlet openings (29) to said ring-shaped space (22) are adapted
diagonally in relation to said inlet holes (25), whereupon the air will circulate first outside

the outer surface of the tap water vessel and thence through the ring-shaped space.
Heating apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that said inlet
openings (29) to said ring-shaped space are equally distributed along the periphery of the

space.
Heating apparatus according to anyone of the preceding claims,

characterized
 in that the burner tube (21) and the flanges (20) are made of
extruded aluminum, the surface of which preferably are riffled to increase the heat

transferring surface area. 
Heating apparatus according to anyone of the previous claims,

characterized
 by a baffle (18) extending axially in the burner tube (3) and having
a lower surface which is spaced from its upper surface and a closed end which is spaced

from a closed end (13) of the burner tube, said baffle (18) further being spaced from the
top and the bottom of said burner tube so as to provide a space for the burner and a path

Heating apparatus according to claim 7, 
characterized
 in that the
baffle (18) has a concave upper surface facing the inner surface at the top of said burner

tube.
Heating apparatus according to anyone of the previous claims,
