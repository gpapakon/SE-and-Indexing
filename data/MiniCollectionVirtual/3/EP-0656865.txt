<ABSTRACT>
By an oblique feeding of articles (8) onto vacant areas or trays (4) of a sorting conveyor (2) it is known to use a feeding conveyor (6, 14), on which the articles are successively accelerated up to the required loading speed. This feeding shall be initiated from standstill, when the vacant area (4A, B, C) is located at a certain distance from the place of infeed, and the associated time lapse makes it difficult to arrange for a correct feeding into trays immediately succeeding each other, particularly if the supply of the articles to the feeding conveyor is not fully synchronous. The invention provides for an improvement into different manners, viz. for one thing by a length separation of the feeding conveyor in individually controllable sections (14a-d), whereby one article (8) may be under rapid final loading whilst other articles may be under acceleration at lower speed on the same conveyor, and for another thing by the use of requirement controlled accelerations, which may lead to intermediate velocities higher than the feeding speed. Hereby lately supplied article may catch-up with a vacant tray (4), which could not otherwise be reached with the use of a standard acceleration to the feeding speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD AND A SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLED LOADING OF ARTICLES ONTO A SORTING CONVEYOR.The present invention relates to a method for feed¬ ing transportation objects onto a conveyor of such a type that advances objects positioned in well-controll¬ ed, mutually separated positions, in particular a con¬ veyor sorter of the type comprising a movable row of carrier platforms or trays for single objects to be selectively discharged at different receiving stations alongside the conveyor. With these conveyor type sor¬ ters, certain.problems are encountered when an optimal utilization of the actual sorting capacity is desired, since the feeding of objects, e.g. parcel post packages, should take place in an optimized synchronous manner, which only occurs in exceptional cases.The sorter conveyor is moved at quite great veloci¬ ty to achieve ample capacity, and therefore it constitu¬ tes a special problem to deposit the objects at exact positions on the conveyor as the objects are apt to skid uncontrollably on the conveyor if they are merely inser¬ ted sideways onto the conveyor with enough speed to be deposited on a vacant space thereon. For the same reason, special "inclined feeders" have been developed enabling the objects to be fed sideways concurrent with being advanced so fast on the obliquely debouching feeder conveyor that their velocity component in the longitudinal direction of the sorter conveyor is commen¬ surate with the velocity of the sorter. Hereby, it is possible to feed objects for pin-point positioning on a rapidly moving conveyor, e.g. on a vacant tray between two already filled trays thereon.However, substantial requirements are demanded of the applied control equipment to utilize this form of feeding operation in practice. An object or a package, e.g. to be delivered at a given positon on the conveyor, must be accelerated from a standstill point of reference up to the relatively high rate of delivery, which is bound to take some time. It is crucial to have full 

control of the position of the package on the feeding conveyor to ensure that the loading is going to take place exactly in the desired space and, as a case in point, the feeding operation will fail if the feeding belt is started up so fast that the package will slip on this belt. Thus, the feeding of the package must be initiated reasonably well ahead of the actual discharge onto the conveyor.Various techniques have already been suggested by which to improve these conditions, e.g. by building up the feeding conveyor in sections in such a

C L A I M S :
1. Method for controlled loading of objects to well-defined mutually separated positions on a main conveyor, in particular a sorter conveyor with carrier trays for the objects, by which method the objects are transported successively to an area of receipt on a dirigible feeder conveyor on which the objects are acce¬ lerated for sideways delivery onto a desired carrier place of the main conveyor with a velocity component in the longitudinal direction of the latter, the feeder conveyor being controlled depending upon the actual carrier place passing a release area at a certain spac¬ ing prior to the place where the sideways delivery is effectuated, characterized in that a feeder conveyor is used which is divided, in its longitudinal direction, into a number of sectionalized conveyors being individu¬ ally controllable; and in that these conveyors in con¬ nection with an irregular supply of objects to the feeder conveyor are controlled, with variable accelera¬ tion, such that the rate of advancement of the objects is currently adjusted to the given options for the deli¬ very of the objects onto the regularly occurring carrier places on the main conveyor, whereas at least some of the sectionalized conveyors are sometimes geared up to speeds, at which the said velocity component is greater than the rate of advancement of the main conveyor.
2. Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the sectionalized conveyors are controlled in con¬ sideration of the available carrier places being more or less advanced in the said release area, which is of a certain length.
3. A system for execution of the method according to claim 1 comprising a main conveyor and at least one feeder conveyor, the path of which is forwardly and inwardly inclined towards the main conveyor and is di- 


rigible for controlled loading of objects to passing vacant carrier places on the main conveyor, characte¬ rized in that, in its longitudinal direction, the feeder conveyor is divided into several individually controlled sub conveyors of which at least one is arranged with a control system enabling current requirement-detected velocity changes for dynamically adjusting the feeding conveyance for a correct loading in of the individual objects.
4. A system according to claim 3, characterized in that the sub conveyors or one or more of these are a- dapted for acceleration regulation to a velocity exeed- ing that at which the objects are fed onto the main conveyor.
