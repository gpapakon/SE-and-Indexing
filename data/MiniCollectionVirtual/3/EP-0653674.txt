<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a light-sensitive silver 
halide photographic material that can obtain a 
photographic print having a moderate glossiness and having 
superior detail representation and visual sharpness of 
images. Because of a high sensitivity, superior gradation, 
sharpness, graininess and color reproduction and a 
suitability for high-volume finishing operation, light-sensitive 
silver halide photographic materials are 
nowadays very widely used. When people take trips or join 
a variety of events, not only snapshots are taken by 
individuals but also various group portraits are taken, 
and kept in commemoration. Also, photographs have begun 
to be used for decoration of coin-operated lockers of  
 
railroad stations or shutters of stores. In other 
instances, photographs are stuck to name cards, and also 
postcards to which photographs have been stuck are 
nowadays used in New Year's cards or the like. Under such 
circumstances where photographs are increasingly used in a 
very variety of places in life, photographs have been 
sought to be easy and simple to handle, and also to have 
images with a much higher quality, in particular, to have 
visually sharp images. In what is called photographic prints, baryta paper 
or paper supports coated with a polyolefin such as 
polyethylene have been hitherto in wide use. In 
particular, polyolefin-coated paper supports have been 
used in large number since processing chemicals do not 
soak into the supports to therefore enable rapid 
processing and drying. Polyolefin-coated paper supports are coated with a 
polyolefin resin on both sides of the paper, and a white 
pigment such as titanium oxide is contained therein on the 
side on which silver halide photographic emulsion layers 
are provided, and it forms a reflective layer. Because of 
a difficulty in uniformly dispersing white pigments such 
as titanium oxide in polyolefins, a limit must be set to 
the amount of the white pigment to be dispersed in the 
polyolefin. As a result, with regard to the light  
 
reflected on the surface of a polyolefin layer, the 
diffusion of light in the polyolefin layer or the 
diffusion of light in the base paper beneath it has become 
non-negligible, so that there is a disadvantage that the 
sharpness can not be well improved. Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public 
Inspection (hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent 
O.P.I. Publication) No. 69630/1978 discloses a technique 
in which a specific compound is incorporated into a white 
pigment layer of, e.g., a
