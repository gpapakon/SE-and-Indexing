<ABSTRACT>
A control module 11 for use with a hydrocarbon module 
6 such as a spool tree. The control module 11 contains 

valve actuators 15 which, when the control module is 
coupled to the hydrocarbon module, are arranged to operate 

valves 8 in the hydrocarbon module.

<DESCRIPTION>
In oil and gas fields, controls, sensors and valve
actuators are conventionally spread over the whole
structure of, for example, a subsea production tree. A
previously accepted disadvantage of such an arrangement is
that if any part of this equipment should fail, the tree
has to be pulled for the damage to be corrected and this
involves extensive workover operations and loss of
production time, with the commensurate expense.GB-A-2205877 discloses a retrievable actuating
mechanism for a single subsea tree choke.According to the present invention, an assembly of
equipment for use in a gas or oil field comprises a
hydrocarbon module containing fluid flow passages which are
controlled by moving valve parts, and a separate control
module which contains valve actuators, and which is
arranged to be brought into juxtaposition with and fixed
with respect to the hydrocarbon module whereby moving parts
of the valve actuators are engageable with the moving valve
parts across an interface between the modules to enable
operation of the valves by the actuators.The control module may be fixed to the hydrocarbon
module, or both modules may be fixed to a common base.The hydrocarbon module could take many forms such as
a production tree, a manifold, a separator or a pumping
head. The valves in this module may be flow valves, chokes
or connectors but without their actuators, the actuators
being provided separately in the control module. Most
simply the moving actuator parts are rods which, at the
interface between the modules, are arranged to abut end to
end with respective rods forming the moving valve parts.
Preferably the valves are fail safe closed and the valves
rods are pushed by extension of the actuator rods to open
the respective valves.The actuators may be hydraulically or pneumatically
operated pistons, or electrical actuators and a control
module designed to be operated by one mode could be changed 
to one operated by different mode, e.g. an electric module
could be replaced by an hydraulic module, without any
modification to the hydrocarbon module.In case one of the actuators should become stuck in a
position in which it extends across the interface, it is
desirable that the control module is coupled to the
hydrocarbon module in such a way that to disengage the
control module from the hydrocarbon module, the control
module undergoes a first movement to disengage the
actuators from the moving valve parts to allow the valves
to close, while the control module and hydrocarbon module
are still engaged, and a

<CLAIMS>
An assembly of equipment for use in a gas or oil field
comprising a hydrocarbon module (6) containing fluid flow

passages which are controlled by moving valve parts (10),
and a separate control module (11) which contains valve

actuators (16), and which is arranged to be brought into
juxtaposition with and fixed with respect to the

hydrocarbon module whereby moving parts of the valve
actuators (16) are engageable with the moving valve parts

(10) across an interface between the modules to enable
operation of the valves by the actuators.
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the control
module is fixed to the hydrocarbon module.
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the control
module and hydrocarbon module are fixed to a common base.
An assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the moving actuator parts are rods (16)

which, at the interface between the modules (6,11), are
arranged to abut end to end with respective rods forming

the moving valve parts (10).
An assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the valves (8) are fail safe closed and the

valves rods (10) are pushed by extension of the actuator
rods (16) to open the respective valves.
An assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the control module (11) incorporates valve

actuation monitoring equipment and data gathering systems.
An assembly according to claim 6, wherein the control
module (11) is connected via a hub to a part of the 

hydrocarbon module (6) which has connections downhole or by
umbilical to other stations.
An assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the control module (11) is coupled to the

hydrocarbon module (6) in such a way that to disengage the
control module from the hydrocarbon module, the control

module undergoes a first movement to disengage the
actuators (16) from the moving valve parts (10) to allow

the valves to close, while the control module and
hydrocarbon module are still engaged, and a second movement

to disengage the control module from the hydrocarbon
module.
