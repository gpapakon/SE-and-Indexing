<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radio device for operation in at least two different radio systems having unequal bands of operating frequencies represented by channels numbers. The device comprises a radio trasmitter (1); a radio receiver (2); a frequency synthesizer (3) for generating local oscillator frequencies for the radio transmitter and radio receiver; respectively and a control means (4, 5) for controlling the frequency synthesizer (3) so as to look it to transmitting and receiving frequencies corresponding to a selected channel number. In the invention, the control means comprises a memory (5) for storing frequency synthesizer control data of a single channel number for each different radio system, on the basis of which control data the control means is capable of deriving control data of any other channel number for the radio system in which the radio device is currently operating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radio device for
operation in at least two different radio systems
having unequal bands of operating frequencies represented
by channel numbers, the radio device
comprising a radio transmitter; a radio receiver; a
frequency synthesizer means for generating local
oscillator frequencies for the radio transmitter and
the radio receiver, respectively; and a control means
for controlling the frequency synthesizer means so as
to lock the synthesizer means to transmitting and
receiving frequencies corresponding to a selected
channel number.In private automatic mobile radio networks or
trunked networks, several user groups or even several
user organizations share the same radio channels and
other resources in a common network. Typical private
radio network applications include energy production
and distribution, communal and municipal services,
transportation, construction, maintenance, and emergency
services, such as police, fire alarm and
ambulance. A private mobile radio network may offer
fast access within the user's own organization,
individual or group communication, data communication,
etc. The system checks the subscriber authorization
and allocates resources. An individual subscriber
is unaware that he uses the same frequencies
as other subscribers as the system automatically selects
a free radio channel for a call during the call
set-up. This kind of radio telephone systems usually
have a rather limited geographical coverage, and so 
the user may easily get outside the service area of
his own system, and thus cannot use his radio telephone.
Therefore there has arisen a need to be able
to use the same radio telephone in several different
systems.The specifications MPT 1327 and MPT 1343 issued
by the British Ministry of Trade and Industry have
become kind of de facto standards in Europe for
private mobile radio networks. MPT 1327 specifies
signalling over the radio path, while MPT 1343
specifies the operation and structure of the radio
telephone. Systems complying with these specifications
have been and will be introduced in different
European countries. All radio telephones used in the
different systems actually comply with the same MPT
1343 specification, wherefore they can, in principle,
be transferred from one radio telephone network to
another by varying the network-specific radio telephone
parameters complying with the MPT 1343.The radio telephone systems usually employ
special radio channel numbers in all internal signalling
for representing transmitting and receiving
