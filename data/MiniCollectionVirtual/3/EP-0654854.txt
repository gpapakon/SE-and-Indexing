<ABSTRACT>
A female electrical terminal element has means at 
one end for crimping a wire lead thereto and a second end in 

the form of a socket for receiving a male contact pin. The 
socket includes a cantilevered contact floor which is unitary 

with the socket and is formed by folding the cantilevered 
contact floor about a bight while maintaining support at the 

bight. A spring biased contact is disposed within the socket 
in opposed relation to the cantilevered contact floor for 

urging the male contact blade into abutment with the 
cantilevered contact floor. A method for forming a female 

electrical terminal component from a unitary blank utilizes 
folding a pair of side flanges to extend substantially normal 

with respect to a base portion to form a channel. A 
cantilevered contact floor is then folded about a bight, 

while in alignment with the channel and supported at the 
bight, to overlie the base 
portion. The side flanges are 
then bent so that free ends thereof overlie the contact 

portion in spaced relation with respect thereto to form the 
socket.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrical terminal and to a method for fabricating
that terminal. More particularly, the present
invention relates to an electrical terminal and a
method of fabricating that terminal wherein the
terminal is a female terminal utilizing a contact
spring to urge an inserted male contact blade into
contact with a contact floor which is unitary with the
female terminal.As automobiles increasingly rely on
electrical components, the number of electrical
terminals necessarily increases. In that the
electrical components interact with one another, it is
increasingly important that electrical connections be
properly made so that each contact carries the current
load which it is expected to transmit. In automobiles,
electrical connections are frequently subjected to
impacts and vibration due to the motion and vibration
caused by both vehicular motion and engine operation.
In addition, since many electrical components are
proximate the engine of a vehicle, the components are
subjected to heat. Moreover, moisture and road dirt
can over time invade electrical terminals when from
time to time the terminals are disconnected for
maintenance purposes.Preferably, electrical terminals should 
maintain good contact when connected, while allowing the terminals to be easily
both initially connected, and subsequently disconnected and then reconnected,
perhaps a number of times. Over time, many currently available electrical terminals
fail to continuously transmit adequate current and, from time to time, fail when
being disconnected and reconnected.It is also highly desirable to maximize the current carrying capacity
of electrical terminals so that their physical size may be minimized as well as their
number.U.S. Patent 4,560,231 provides an electrical contact which is stamped
or punched from a thin sheet of metal. In forming the contact, part of the sheet is
bent back on itself to form a resilient spring located to urge a pin received in the
contact against an abutting portion of said contact.In view of the aforementioned considerations, it is a feature of the
instant invention to provide a new and improved electrical terminal in which a
good, reliable electrical connection is maintained over a time with periodic
disconnections and reconnections, which does not fail during either the fabrication
process or upon initial coupling and which has increased current carrying capacity.According to the present invention there is provided a female
electrical terminal including a crimp at a first end

<CLAIMS>
A female electrical terminal (10) including a crimp (18) at a first end
(20) for crimping a wire lead (12) thereto, a socket (24) at a second end (20) for

receiving a male contact pin (14), the socket (24) including a base portion (57) and
flanges (44,46) extending upward and inward to overlie the base portion (57), and a

contact overlying the base portion (57) and joined thereto by a bight (80), 
characterized

extending peripheral foot flanges (74,76) depending from side edges thereof and

projecting toward the base portion (51).
A terminal (10) according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the contact
floor (31) includes a pair of parallel, spaced ribs (78,79) extending in a direction away

from the foot flanges (74,76), the ribs (78,79) being formed by embossments (52,54)
