<ABSTRACT>
Optical magnifying apparatus comprises an objective lens (11) from which light is directed to a beam splitting mirror (12). A portion of the light passes through the beam splitting mirror to a first concave mirror (13) and is reflected back via the beam splitting mirror through a viewing lens (5) to a first eye (16) of an observer. The remainder of the light is reflected by the beam splitting mirror to a second concave mirror (17) from which it is reflected back via the beam splitting mirror through the viewing lens to a second eye (19) of the observer. Focussed first and second images (14, 18) of an object (10) are produced respectively on the surfaces of the first and second concave mirrors. The optical axes of the concave mirrors are relatively offset such that the relayed pupils of the mirrors are separated horizontally by a distance approximately equal to the average interpupilary spacing of an observer. The relative inclination of the optical axes of the concave mirrors may be adjustable to enable non-stereoscopic or stereoscopic images of the object to be observed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical magnifying apparatus for 
producing a magnified image of an object for viewing by an 
observer and in particular to such apparatus for producing 
a magnified binocular or stereoscopic image of an object. 
A similar apparatus is known from EP-A-0076344. While known single lens magnifiers are capable of 
providing low magnification factors, for example up to 2x 
of an object, such magnifiers are not capable of providing 
higher magnification factors, for example in the range 4x 
to 10x. Furthermore the exit pupil diameters provided by 
such single lens magnifiers are small and consequently 
restrict the position of the eyes of an observer from 
which the magnified image may be viewed. Also when it is 
desired to view the magnified image of the object 
stereoscopically with both eyes the relationship of the 
magnified image to the angle of view by each eye tends to 
be incorrect and confuses the observer. According to the invention, which is defined in claim 1, an optical magnification apparatus 
comprises an object lens to receive light from an object 
to be viewed; beam splitting means to receive light 
emergent from said object lens and to direct 'a first 
portion of said emergent light to a first optical element 
and to direct a second portion of said emergent light to a 
second optical element; said first optical element 
including a first mirror and said second optical element 
including a second mirror; said first and second optical 
elements being so located that focussed first and second 
images of the object being viewed are produced by the 
object lens on said first and second mirrors respectively; 
and a viewing lens located to receive light constituting 
said first and second images and reflected by said first 
and second mirrors to produce magnified images of said 
object for perception by the eyes of an observer.  
 An embodiment of the invention will now be described by 
way of example with reference to the drawing which is a 
perspective view of the optical elements of optical 
magnifying apparatus in accordance with the invention. Referring to the drawing, light from an object 10 is 
collected by an objective lens 11 and is directed to a 
beam splitting mirror 12. The beam splitting mirror 12 
preferably comprises a half silvered planar mirror. A 
proportion of the light from the objective lens 11 passes 
through the beam splitting mirror and falls on a first 
concave mirror 13. The mirror 13 is located at a distance 
from the objective lens 11, in
