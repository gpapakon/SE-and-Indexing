<ABSTRACT>
In a flexible connection for two pipe sections with a metal bellows (3) gastightly connected axially on both sides to connectors (1; 2), the sides of the connectors (1, 2) towards the bellows (3) have radially widened end sections (4, 5) with cylindrical end regions (10, 11). There are also a damping insert (12) coaxial with the bellows, extending over its length and integral therewith and an internally effective heat protector (16) for the bellows (3). The damping insert (12) surrounds the bellows (3) on the outside and the bellows' corrugations (3') lie against it. The lateral end regions of the damping insert (12) are held in the end sections (4, 5) without a clamp and are supported radially outward thereby. The connectors (1, 2) are secured together via a spring (13) radially surrounding the damping insert on the outside. The heat protector takes the form of a pipe section (16) running coaxially with the bellows (3) with a radial distance inside it and is secured to the forward connector (1) in the direction of flow.

Flexible connection arrangement for two pieces of 
pipe, in particular in exhaust gas systems of motor 

vehicles, having a metal bellows (3) connected axially 
on both sides in a gas-tight manner to connectors (1, 

2) in the form of substantially cylindrical sleeves or 
pipe sockets, the connectors (1, 2), at their sides 

facing the bellows (3), having radially enlarged end 
portions (4, 5) with substantially cylindrical end 

regions (10, 11), the arrangement further having a 
damping insert (12) lying coaxially with respect to the 

bellows (3), extending over the length thereof and in 
operative connection therewith, and a radially inwardly 

effective heat protector (16) for the bellows (3), 
characterized in that the damping insert (12) radially 

surrounds the bellows (3) externally, wherein the folds 
(3') of the bellows (3) lie against the damping insert 

(2) , the axial end regions of the damping insert (12) 
are held in the enlarged end portions (4, 5) of the 

connectors (1, 2), without being fixed thereto, and are 
supported in a radially outward direction by the 

cylindrical end regions (10, 11) thereof, in that 
further the connectors (1, 2) are connected to one 

another by means of a spring (13) radially surrounding 
the damping insert (12) externally, and in that the 

heat protector is formed by a portion of pipe (16) 
running coaxially with respect to the bellows (3) 

radially spaced apart therefrom and inside the same, 
which pipe portion is secured to the connector (1) 

lying upstream in the direction of flow..  
 
Flexible connection arrangement according to claim 
1, characterized in that the spring (13) is arranged 

with a radial spacing (x) apart from the outer 
circumference of the damping insert (12). 
Flexible connection arrangement according to claim 
1, characterized in that the spring (13) rests on the

transition piece (8; 9) which enlarges conically 

obliquely outwards to the bellows-side end of the 
connector (1; 2), which transition piece in turn 

continues to become the respective cylindrical end 
region (10; 11) of the connector (1; 2) in question.
