Process for the automatic recognition of objects, in 
particular of irregularly and/or discontinuously 

formed objects such as for example cell clusters, in 
which an initial image, having n.m image points, is 

taken of the object region to be investigated by means 
of a video camera,
 
characterised by
 
the following further process steps: 


(a) the image point signals provided by the video camera 
(3) are compared with an upper and a lower threshold 

value in a window comparator (17; 17a, 17b, 17c); 
(b) in correspondence with the output signal of the window 
comparator, the number of image point elements lying 

between the threshold values is determined for a 
region (a.b) of the initial image, and this number is 

stored in an element of a memory matrix (23) for a 
reduced image, the position of each individual matrix 

element in the memory matrix (23) corresponding to the 
position of the associated region (a.b) in the output 

image of the video camera (3); 
(c) the reduced image held in the memory matrix (23) is 
scanned with a mask, the central element of the mask 

being laid over an element of the reduced image the 
content of which exceeds a predetermined value SW, and 

then those matrix elements within the mask whose 
contents also exceed the predetermined value SW are 

detected and are considered as belonging together with 
the initial image element and are allocated the same 

index I, this procedure being repeated for each matrix 
element of the memory matrix (23) of the reduced image 

whose content exceeds the predetermined value and 
which has not yet been allocated an index in a 

preceding scanning. 
Process according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
in correspondence to the output signal of the window 

comparator (17) a value is stored in a memory element 
of a first memory matrix (22), having n·m memory 

elements, for each image point of the initial image, 
the position of the respective memory element 

corresponding to the position of the associated image 
point in the initial image. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that,
 
an RGB camera is employed,

comparator (17 a-c) and the output signals of the 

window comparators are supplied to a multiplier (19),
 
and in that,
 
the output signal of the multiplier is stored in a 

memory element of the first memory (22). 
Process according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that,

the AND gate are supplied to the first memory (22). 
Device for the automatic recognition of objects, in 
particular of irregularly and/or discontinuously 

formed objects such as for example cell clusters, in 
which an initial image, having n·m image points, is 

taken of the object region to be investigated by means 
of a video camera (3),
 
characterised by
 
one or more window comparators (17a, 17b, 17c) in 

which the image point signals provided by the video 
camera (3) are compared with an upper and a lower 

threshold value;

corresponds to the format of the video camera, and in 
which, in correspondence with the output signal of the 

window comparators, there is stored a value for each

point signals lying between the threshold values, for
