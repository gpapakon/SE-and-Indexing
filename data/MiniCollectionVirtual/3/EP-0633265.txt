<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a process for the 
preparation of hydrolyzable β-cyanoalkylsilanes. More 

particularly, this invention is a process for the catalytic 
addition of silicon hydrides to α,β-unsaturated olefinic 

nitriles to form β-cyanoalkylsilanes. The present process 
employs a novel catalyst comprising an aminoorganosilane and 

a copper source. The catalyst may be provided to the process 
on a solid support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for the
preparation of hydrolyzable beta-cyanoalkylsilanes. More
particularly, this invention is a process for the catalytic
addition of silicon hydrides to α,β-unsaturated olefinic
nitriles to form β-cyanoalkylsilanes. The present process
employs a novel catalyst comprising an aminoorganosilane and
a copper source. The catalyst may be provided to the
process on a solid support.Hydrolyzable β-cyanoalkylsilanes prepared by the
present process are useful for the production of polyorganosiloxanes
containing the β-cyanoalkyl substituent.
The silicon-bonded β-cyanoalkyl radical is extremely
resistant to hydrolysis and cleavage under hot, humid
conditions. Therefore, the β-cyanoalkylsilanes find
particular use in the preparation of polyorganosiloxanes
which must be subjected to hot, humid conditions. The
presence of the silicon-bonded β-cyanoalkyl radical
substituted on polyorganosiloxanes also tends to stabilize
the polyorganosiloxanes against swelling induced by liquid
hydrocarbons.Bluestein, U. S. Patent No. 2,971,970, issued
February 14, 1961, describes a process for preparing cyanoalkylsilanes
which comprises reacting a hydrolyzable silicon
hydride with an α,β-unsaturated olefinic nitrile in the
presence of a diamine, a tertiary amine and a cuprous
compound selected from the class consisting of cuprous oxide
and cuprous halides.Bluestein, U. S. Patent No. 2,971,972, issued
February 14, 1961, discloses a process for adding phenyldichlorosilane
to acrylonitrile in the presence of a
catalyst composition consisting essentially of a 
trialkylamine and a cuprous compound selected from the group
consisting of cuprous halides and cuprous oxide.Svoboda et al., Collection Czechoslov. Chem.
Commun. 38: 3834-3836, 1973, teach binary systems of a
copper compound (Cu2O, CuCl or Cu(acac)2) and an isocyanide
(tert-butyl or cyclohexyl isocyanide) as effective catalysts
for hydrosilation of acrylonitrile by trichlorosilane and
methyldichlorosilane.Rajkumar et al., Organometallics 8:550-552, 1989,
reveal a two-component catalyst, consisting of cuprous oxide
and tetramethylethylenediamine, that promotes β-hydrosilylation
of acrylonitrile.The present invention provides a process for
preparation of β-cyanoalkylsilanes described by formula:
