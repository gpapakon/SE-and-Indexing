<DESCRIPTION>
Since the energy density available from batteries based on oxidation/reduction reactions of
ions in the electrolyte solution is directly proportional to the concentration of redox ions
undergoing oxidation or reduction in the electrolyte solution, the energy density available
from batteries based on redox electrolyte solutions is limited generally by the maximum
solubility of redox salts of the various oxidation states in the electrolyte solution, and in
particular the redox component with the lowest solubility.In the vanadium redox battery employing V(II)/V(III) and V(IV)/V(V) redox couples in the
H2SO4 for the negative and positive half-cell electrolyte solutions respectively, the
vanadium concentration has been limited to less than 2M (about 1.8M) due to precipitation
of V(II) and V(III) at low temperatures and the thermal precipitation of V(V) at high
temperatures. The solubility of the V(II), V(III) and V(IV) ions increases with increasing
temperatures, however, V(V) undergoes thermal precipitation to V2O5 at temperatures
above 30°C.For example if a 2 M V(V) solution is exposed to temperatures of 30°C, a slight precipitate
will start to form after 2 days, with heavy precipitation evident after only 4 days. At 40°
C, a heavy precipitate will form after 2 days in a 2 M V(V) solution. Even a 1.8 M V(V)
solution will precipitate after 6 days at 40°C. This problem in use can be avoided by reducing the vanadium ion concentration to less
than 1.8 M for applications where the temperature is likely to exceed 40°C and where the
systems will be maintained in fully charged state for long periods. However in many
applications it is not desirable to reduce the vanadium ion concentration below 2.0 M since
such a reduction effectively reduces the capacity and energy density of the battery.In PCT/AU94/00711, a stabilised vanadium electrolyte solution was described which
employed stahilising agents to inhibit the precipitation of vanadium from supersaturated
solutions. Thus, 3M V(V) solution could be stabilised for several weeks by addition of 1-3wt%
glycerol, while 3M V(II) was stabilised by 1-3wt% ammonium oxalate. A mixture
of glycerol and ammonium oxalate inhibited precipitation of both V(II) and V(V) ions
allowing a 3M vanadium electrolyte solution to operate successfully in a vanadium redox
cell for close to six months. A large number of other organic and inorganic additives were
also shown to inhibit the precipitation of vanadium from supersaturated solutions.While these additives play a vital role in
