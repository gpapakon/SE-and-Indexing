<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for handling products in the context of the packaging process with the aid of two counter-running pivotable pushers which move to and fro and which alternately displace a product along a path in the desired direction. To this end, the pushers are mounted displaceably in the transport direction on at least one guide rod and their drive takes place by means of at least one rotating traction means which travels forwards and backwards alternately.

Apparatus for transporting products in the context of a packaging 
process with the aid of two pushers (3a, 3b) which work in opposite 

directions, move back and forth and are able to which pushers 
alternately move a product (1) in the desired direction along a track (2), 

the pusher that is inactive being returned in a passive position in which it 
is pivoted upwards away from the track (2) to the starting position 

which corresponds to the next product and being pivoted into the active 
position again, characterised in that the pushers (3a, 3b) are mounted to 

be movable in the transport direction along at least one guide rod 
(5a, 5b) and their drive means is provided by at least one circulating 

traction means, especially a belt (6a, 6b), which moves alternately 
backwards and forwards, the traction means (6a, 6b) being driven by a 

servo motor (9) having a programmable speed profile. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the traction 
means (6a, 6b) circulates around pulleys (7, 8), and one pusher (3b) is 

connected to the upper run of the traction means and the other pusher 
(3a) is connected to the lower run. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that a traction means 
(6a, 6b) is arranged on both sides above the product track (2) and each 

pusher (3a, 3b) is assigned its own traction means (6a, 6b) and the two 
traction means are connected to a common drive means (9). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the connection 
between pusher (3a, 3b) and traction means (6a, 6b) is made 
via
 an 
overload coupling (16a, 16b) which can be re-engaged in only one 

synchronous position. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the ends of the 
traction means are brought together adjustably in a common connection 

element. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the traction 
means is a toothed belt. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that it has for each 
pusher (3a, 3b) two guide tracks (10a, 10b; 11a, 11b) at different 

heights for producing the pivoting movement, which guide tracks are  
 

connected at their ends by a switchover (12) and in which guide tracks a 
sliding block (13a, 13b), connected to the pusher, slides.
