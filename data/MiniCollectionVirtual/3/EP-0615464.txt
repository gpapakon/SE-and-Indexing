<ABSTRACT>
A bat in the form of a sleeve can be slid over the hand of a player so that the latter can play as in tennis, on any type of ground , with or without a bounce on the ground. The bat (1) comprises an upper sleeve element (5) and a lower sleeve element (6) joined along an edge (7) wherein an opening (10) is provided for inserting the hand. Each sleeve element is more rigid in a flat central portion (11, 12) forming a striking surface than close to its periphery. The bat envelops and holds the hand due to its inherent elasticity. It may also comprise retaining means (13) on the surface and closure devices to each side of the wrist.

Bat for ball game, comprising two striking surfaces on opposite sides and provided 
in a sleeve to receive a player's open hand, the sleeve being made up of two elements 

(5, 6, 24, 25) in a general flat shape, which are joined to one another along their 
periphery with the exception of an opening (10) for inserting the hand, characterised 

in that each sleeve element or both elements together are made in one moulded piece 
in synthetic material, so that each sleeve element has a rigid central portion (11, 12, 

26, 29) forming a substantially flat striking surface and a flexible peripheral part 
designed to hold the hand by elasticity between said elements and in that each sleeve 

element has a free edge (8, 9) with a rounded, convex profile on the hand side, along 
said opening (10). 
Bat of claim 1, wherein at least one of the sleeve's elements comprises airholes (20, 
28) in the area of its striking surface. 
Bat of claim 2, wherein the airholes (20, 28) are defined by a grid of rigid ribs (21, 
27) extending over at least part of the striking surface. 
Bat of claim 3, wherein said grid has an irregular layout forming a decorative 
figure. 
Bat of claim 1, wherein the sleeve element located on the palm side of the hand 
presents, on its inner surface, at least one hollow (13) to hold said palm on said 

opening's side. 
Bat of claim 1, wherein at least one of said sleeve elements presents, on its inner 
surface, at least one protuberance (22) which fits between the fingers of the hand. 
Bat of claim 1, wherein at least one of the two sleeve elements has two folds (14) 
provided either side of the position of the hand and converging in the direction of said 

opening (10), and closing devices (16, 17) provided on the outside of the folds and 
designed to join the two elements together in such a way that they can be released on 

either side of a user's wrist.
