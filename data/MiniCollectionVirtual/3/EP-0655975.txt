<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic by (a) drawing an assembly of plastic layers (62) against a hot, contoured, e.g. of compound curvature, mold surface (28) to provide a shaped plastic preform at elevated temperature; (b) transferring the shaped preform without cooling to an adjacent unheated glass layer (60) of substantially matching surface contour to heat bond the shaped plastic preform to the glass layer; and then (c) removing heat from the shaped plastic preform via conductive heat transfer to the glass layer to form the shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic layers. A bilayer glazing panel is formed in a conventional unmodified autoclave bonding system by exposing the prelaminate to elevated temperature and pressure to firmly bond the plastic to the glass.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FORMING A SHAPED PRELAMINATE AND BI AYER GLAZING OF GLASS AND PLASTIC BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to bilayer safety glazings and more particularly to a method of forming a prelaminate for use in forming a bilayer safety panel.Laminated glazings for vehicle windshields, sidelights, rear lights, sun-roofs, architectural glass including sky lights, security glass and the like are known. A bilayer form is a laminate of transparent glass and layers of laminated plastic on one side only of the glass. Non-planar bilayer glazing panels are also known as are problems of objectionable streaks, lines, wrinkles and other optical deficiencies in one or more of the plastic layers. Such problems are addressed in the following prior art patents. While moderately successful, the systems of these patents are not without deficiencies. U.S. 4,944,822 - glass and plastic layers are joined by a room temperature bondable adhesive. The separately applied adhesive must be optically compatible with the other components of the bilayer. U.S. 5,069,734 - a shaped plastic pre- laminate preformed in the absence of glass is later mated with and bonded to glass of matching curvature. The surface curvature of the bent glass must exactly match the shaped prelaminate or optical properties of the finished bilayer are adversely affected. U.S. 5,082,515 - plastic layers are shaped against and then bonded to glass within an autoclave 

laminating assembly. Conventional autoclave bonding systems must be revised and cycles extended to accommodate plastic shaping.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Now, process improvements have been made further developing the art of forming bilayer glazings.Accordingly, a principal object of this invention is an improved process of reduced complexity for forming a semi-finished prelaminate of layered glass and plastic usable to form a wrinkle-free bilayer glazing panel of non-planar shape.Another object is to uncouple plastic shaping from autoclave bonding in forming a bilayer glazing panel of compound curvature.A further object is to provide an improved, industrially valuable process for forming such a prelaminate which can be used with conventional autoclave bonding systems. Other objects will in part be obvious and will in part appear from the following detailed description and claims.These and other objects are accomplished by a process for forming a shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic which comprises: a) drawing an assembly of plastic layers against a hot, contoured, e.g. of compound

WHAT WE CLAIM IS:
1. A process for forming a shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic which comprises: a) drawing an assembly of plastic layers against a hot contoured mold surface to provide a shaped plastic preform at elevated temperature; b) transferring the shaped preform without cooling to an adjacent unheated glass layer of substantially matching surface contour to heat bond the shaped plastic preform to the glass layer; and then c) removing heat from the shaped plastic preform via conductive heat transfer to the glass layer to form the shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic.
2. The process of claim 1 wherein the assembly of plastic layers comprises a layer of polyester sandwiched between one outer layer of cross linked polyurethane and another outer layer comprising plasticized partial polyvinyl butyral.
3. A process of forming a shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic layers which comprises: a) drawing an assembly of laminatable plastic layers against a hot mold surface having compound curvature to provide a shaped plastic preform at elevated temperature; b) positioning adjacent the shaped plastic preform, a supported unheated glass layer of surface shape substantially matching that of the shaped plastic preform; c) deairing a space between the shaped plastic preform and the adjacent glass layer; 


 d) transferring the shaped plastic preform without cooling to the deaired glass surface to heat bond the shaped preform to the deaired glass layer; and then e) removing heat from the shaped plastic preform via conductive heat transfer to the glass layer to form the shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic layers.
4. The process of claim 3 wherein the plastic layers are heat laminated to each other in the shaped preform and the shaped preform is heat bonded to the glass layer across substantially the entire confronting surfaces of the glass and plastic.
5. A process for forming a shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic layers which comprises; a) clamping margins of an unheated substantially planar assembly of laminatable plastic layers together to define a shapable zone within the clamped margins in which the plastic layers are restrained against movement with respect to each other; b) positioning the clamped assembly of unheated laminatable plastic layers between a molding surface of compound curvature at elevated temperature and a yieldably supported unheated layer of glass of surface contour substantially matching that of the molding surface; c) moving the clamped assembly of plastic layers toward the mold surface to force the shapable zone against the molding surface thereby imparting compound curvature to the shapable zone and 


 forming from such zone a shaped preform of plastic layers; d) holding the shaped preform against the molding surface until the temperature of the layers of the preform substantially reach the temperature of the molding surface; e) moving the yieldably supported layer of glass toward but not against the shaped preform on the molding surface to form a vented compartment between the shaped preform and adjacent glass layer; f) creating negative pressure within the vented compartment to remove air therefrom; g) forcing the shaped preform off the molding surface into surface contact with the glass layer; h) holding the shaped preform under pressure against the unheated glass layer, while maintaining the clamped margins of plastic layers to conductively transfer heat from the preform to the glass and bond the shaped preform to the glass layer; and i) trimming unwanted portions of the plastic layers outward of the periphery of the glass layer from the shaped preform to form said prelaminate.
6. The process of claim 5 wherein during step g) , negative pressure is maintained within such compartment to promote edge sealing of the shaped preform to the glass layer.

9. The process of any of claims 5, 6, 7 or 8 wherein clamping in step a) is accomplished by closing opposing members of a non-planar clamp on such margins to distort the substantially planar layers of the shapable zone into a configuration approaching that of the molding surface.

A process of forming a bilayer glazing panel which comprises: a) drawing a clamped lightly bonded composite of transparent plastic layers, which includes a layer of plasticized partial polyvinyl butyral, against a hot, non-planar, contoured mold surface to provide a shaped preform of plastic layers at elevated temperature having the plasticized partial polyvinyl butyral layer as an outer layer of such preform; b) transferring the shaped preform without cooling to an adjacent unheated transparent glass layer of substantially matching surface contour to bond the plasticized polyvinyl butyral layer of the shaped plastic preform to the glass layer; c) removing heat from the shaped plastic preform via conductive heat transfer to the glass layer to form a shaped prelaminate of glass and plastic layers; d) transferring the prelaminate to an autoclave laminating assembly; and 


 e) exposing the prelaminate in such assembly to elevated temperature and pressure to increase the bond strength between the plasticized polyvinyl butyral layer and the glass layer and from the bilayer glazing panel of the transparent glass layer and a plastic laminate on one side only of the glass layer.
