<ABSTRACT>
Differential protection unit which can be associated with a multi-pole circuit breaker in order together to constitute a differential circuit breaker. This unit comprising: a housing consisting of a lower half-housing (14A) and an upper half-housing (14B) capable together of enclosing various active elements of the differential protection unit, these various active elements constituting at least: a set of connections (22); a torus with a coil; and a circuit-breaking control mechanism (34). According to the invention, a chassis is provided on which the said active elements (22, 34) are fixed, together forming a rigid functional subassembly (16); it results therefrom that the said functional subassembly (16) can be connected to the differential circuit breaker so as to be able to carry out a functional test of the functional subassembly (16) while being able to have access to at least some of the said active elements (22, 34).

A differential protection unit able to be associated to a multipole circuit breaker to
constitute together a differential circuit breaker, this differential protection unit

comprising :

a case formed by a bottom half-case (14A) and a top half-case (14B) able to enclose
together different active elements of the differential protection unit, these different

active elements constituting at least :
a set of connections (22) constituting electrical conduction channels (26) for the
different poles of the multipole circuit breaker ;
a toroid with a coil (30) designed to be fitted around said electrical conduction
channels to detect a differential current ; and
a tripping control mechanism (34) designed to command a tripping action in the
multipole circuit breaker in response to an electrical signal produced by said toroid

with coil ;

characterized in that it comprises in addition a frame (20) on which said active
elements are fixed forming together a rigid functional sub-assembly (16), said frame

(20) being constituted by a first frame part (20A) made of moulded plastic material
and by a second frame part (208) made of moulded plastic material able to be

coupled to the first frame part,

which results in said functional sub-assembly (16) being able to be connected to the
differential circuit breaker in order to enable a functional test of the functional sub-assembly

(16) to be carried out while at the same time being able to access at least
some of said active elements (22, 30, 34), said functional sub-assembly (16) then

being enclosed in said case (14A, 14B) when said functional test has deemed it to be
functionally satisfactory.
The differential protection unit according to claim 1, characterized in that said first
(20A) and second (20B) frame parts form together, in the coupled position :


an enclosure (42, 44) appreciably completely surrounding a toroid with a coil (30) ;
a partitioned passage (50) situated in the centre of the toroid with coil and designed to
enable said electrical conduction channels (26) to pass through ;
an insulating support for said electrical conduction channels (26) ; and
a support to dispose at least said tripping control mechanism (34) externally.
The differential protection unit according to claim 2, characterized in that it
comprises in addition at least one printed circuit board (32) able to be fitted externally

on said frame in order to command operation of said tripping control mechanism (34)
in response to an electrical signal produced by the toroid with coil (30).
The differential protection unit according to claim 3, characterized in that said top
half-case (14B) comprises a window (84) situated above said printed circuit board

(32) included inside and that a connection cover (18) is provided which forms a cover

and which supports connection contacts (82) on its downwardly directed face (80A),
which results, when the connection cover is fixed onto the upper face of the top half-case

(14B), in the connection cover (18) masking the window (84) and, at the same
time, the connection contacts (82) of the connection cover automatically establishing

the electrical connections between the printed circuit board (32) and the other active
parts contained in the case and, in the opposite case, when the connection cover (18)

is removed, the printed circuit board (32) being fully disconnected thus enabling
dielectric testing of the differential protection unit to be performed without any risk of

damage to the printed circuit board.
