<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head device for a data cartridge includes 
a recording head (31) having a recording magnetic gap and a 

reproducing head having a reproducing magnetic gap united 
in one body. The magnetic head device includes a first 

magnetic head element having a first magnetic gap (g
1
), the 
first magnetic head element having center cores (33a,34a) on both 

lateral sides thereof, 
second and third magnetic gaps (g
2
,g
3
) 
formed by magnetic
 cores (33b,34b) forming closed magnetic circuits 
in the center cores, the magnetic cores being bonded to 

each other via a gap member. The first to third magnetic 
gaps (g
1
,g
2
,g
3
) are arrayed in a 
magnetic recording medium rubbing 

direction. The magnetic cores (33a,33b,34a,34b) 
forming the second and third 

magnetic gaps have inclined gap forming faces. The gap 
forming faces of the magnetic gaps extend in a depth 

direction in a manner non-parallel 
to one another. One (g
1
) of 
the first to third magnetic gaps (g
1
,g
2
,g
3
) 
is used as a recording 

magnetic gap. The recording magnetic gap has a magnetic 
metal film (31d,31c) formed on the gap forming face thereof. The 

magnetic metal film is formed directly on the magnetic core 
without providing an underlying film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic head devices for data 
cartridges. For a variety of computers, hard disks and flexible disks 
are generally used as information storage media. Also, disk 
cartridges are recently used for greater storage capacity. The data cartridge is adapted for short-time reading and 
writing of information signals from and onto a magnetic tape 
contained in a cassette and running at a high speed. A multichannel 
magnetic head device in which plural recording heads and 
reproducing heads are arrayed is usually employed for recording 
and reproducing information signals. Meanwhile, so-called metal tapes and evaporation tapes are 
used as magnetic recording media in response to the recent 
tendency of increasing capacity of data. The metal tapes and the 
evaporation tapes have been developed to reduce effects of 
diamagnetic field or self-demagnetization. Also, an increase in 
capacity of data by thinning the magnetic tape is considered for 
application. On the other hand, for increasing capacity of data, the 
magnetic head needs to be capable of high-density recording onto  
 
the magnetic tape of high coercive force. However, if the magnetic tape of high coercive force 
is used, the magnetic head employing the ferrite core is 
saturated before the tape is saturated. Therefore, 
satisfactory recording cannot be carried out. Stated differently, though a sufficient magnetic field 
is outputted from the gap of the magnetic head for 
recording in the direction of thickness of the magnetic 
tape of high coercive force, a greater recording current 
than in the case of a magnetic tape of low coercive force 
needs to be carried, thus causing head saturation. The 
head saturation occurs mainly in the vicinity of the front 
gap, causing a pseudo gap which weakens the magnetic field 
from the main gap. Thus, characteristics of the magnetic 
tape cannot be sufficiently exhibited. It is essential to narrow the gap for achieving the 
high-density recording. However, the above tendency is 
accelerated as the gap is narrowed. As a result, the 
recording efficiency is considerably deteriorated. According to the first aspect of the invention, there 
is provided a magnetic head device for a data cartridge 
including a recording head having a recording magnetic gap 
and a reproducing head having a reproducing magnetic gap 
united in one body, the recording head having a magnetic 
metal film formed on a magnetic gap forming face thereof. Preferably, the recording head is formed by a magnetic 
core of
