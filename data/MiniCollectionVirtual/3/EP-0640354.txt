<ABSTRACT>
Existing systems typically provide a single dose 
of an aerosol, whereafter a capsule is thrown away, which is 

harmful to the environment. Inhaler devices, for instance 
for 
CNSLD patients, wherein at each inhalation a capsule is 
placed therein, are frequently used in practice. 
Inhaler devices for several doses are still only 
commercially available on a limited scale. There are 

problems with these known inhaler devices in respect of 
their manageability and size, the required suction force on 

a mouth or nose piece and/or the accuracy of dosing. 
Known inhaler devices for several dosed are 
awkward to use and/or consist of a relatively large number 

of components, whereby manufacture becomes time-consuming 
and expensive. Such an inhaler device is known from EP-A-211595. 
The present invention provides a device for 
inhaling an aerosol, comprising: 


a reservoir (3) for storing a supply of medium for 
inhaling; 
an inhaling piece for sucking air (7) along a dose 
of medium for inhaling; and 
transporting means (11,55,56) for transporting a dose of 
medium for inhaling out of the reservoir, wherein a whirl 

chamber (16) is incorporated in the inhaling piece for taking the 
medium into the indrawn air with only a small suction force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inhaler
devices, in particular inhaler devices with which several
doses can be administered. With such inhaler devices an
aerosol is administered as medicine to the lungs,
particularly the alveolar zone, by inhalation through
nose or mouth.Existing systems typically provide a single
dose of an aerosol, whereafter a capsule is thrown away,
which is harmful to the environment. Inhaler devices, for
instance for CNSLD patients, wherein at each inhalation a
capsule is placed therein, are frequently used in
practice.Inhaler devices for several doses are still
only commercially available on a limited scale. There are
problems with these known inhaler devices in respect of
their manageability and size, the required suction force
on a mouth or nose piece and/or the accuracy of dosing.Known inhaler devices for several doses are
awkward to use and/or consist of a relatively large
number of components, whereby manufacture becomes time-consuming
and expensive. Such an inhaler device is known
from EP-A-0 211 595.GB-A-1,118,341 discloses an inhalation device
comprising:
a reservoir for storing a supply of medium
for inhaling;an inhaling piece for sucking air along a
dose of medium for inhaling; anda whirl chamber for taking the medium into
the indrawn air.In this known device an open cartrigde is
placed inside the device, whereafter a lid is closed and
a user places a mouth piece in the mouth.In this known device for every dose of medium
for inhaling, the device has to be opened and closed
again.The present invention provides a multi-dose
aerosol inhaler device, comprising:
a reservoir for storing a supply of medium or
inhaling;an inhaling piece for sucking air along a
dose of medium for inhaling; anda whirl chamber for taking the medium into
the indrawn air, characterized bytransporting means for actively transporting
a dose of medium for inhaling out of the reservoir, said
transporting means comprising a screw or worm, said
medium being maintained under a certain pressure.The present invention provides an inhaler
device that can be used in different positions. The
operation of the inhaling piece, the transporting means
and/or the whirl chamber are not adversely affected by
the position of the inhaler device relative to the
direction of the force of gravity.The whirling and high speed of the air are
advantageous in obtaining particles for inhaling of a
sufficiently small diameter (for instance smaller than 7,
5 or 1 Âµm). The medium in the reservoir usually also
comprises carrier

<CLAIMS>
An aerosol inhaler device (51), comprising:

a reservoir (53) for storing a supply of
medium (M) for inhaling;
an inhaling piece (61) for sucking air along
a dose of medium for inhaling; and
a whirl chamber (55) for taking the medium
into the indrawn air, 
characterized by
transporting means (54) for actively
transporting a dose of medium for inhaling out of the

reservoir, said transporting means comprising a screw or
worm (56), said medium being maintained under a certain

pressure.
An aerosol inhaler device according to claim
1, wherein the medium for inhaling is held under a

certain pressure by a piston under spring pressure.
An aerosol inhaler device according to claim
1 or 2, wherein the whirl chamber (55) is embodied such

that air drawn in through a first opening (62) moves
along the dose of medium for inhaling and subsequently

collides with an air flow drawn into a second opening
(63), wherein a whirling is excited such that the active

constituents of the medium are released to a sufficient
extent with sufficiently small diameter.
An aerosol inhaler device according to claim
1, 2 or 3, wherein a mouth or nose piece (61) is disposed

eccentrically of the central line of the aerosol inhaler
device.
An aerosol inhaler device according to any
of claims 1-4, wherein a guide means (71) for guiding the

airflow is arranged in the vicinity of the center of the
inhaling piece. 
An aerosol inhaler device according to claim
5, wherein the guide means (71) is provided with a

rounded portion and with a sharp-edged portion.
An aerosol inhaler device according to claim
5 or 6, wherein the guide means (71) is provided with a

guide portion for guiding the airflow upward to the mouth
or nose piece.
An aerosol inhaler device according to any
of the claims 1-7, provided with two or more mutually

interchangeable reservoirs with different medium.
