<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing an aqueous resin dispersion 
includes the steps of copolymerizing a polymeric monomer 

whose ratio of (meth) acrolein to a total amount of the 
(meth) acrolein and a vinyl monomer is in the range from 

10 weight% to 80 weight% in an organic solvent to obtain a 
copolymer solution, dispersing the obtained copolymer 

solution in an aqueous medium and removing an unreacted 
(meth) acrolein. Since the above process can extremely 

reduce contents of the unreacted (meth) acrolein and of an 
oligomer whose number-average molecular weight is less 

than 1000, an aqueous resin dispersion where problems of a 
pungent smell, toxicological properties, etc. due to the 

(meth) acrolein and the oligomer are eliminated can be 
provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing an aqueous resin dispersion in which a copolymer 
composed of (meth) acrolein and a vinyl monomer other than 
(meth) acrolein is dispersed in an aqueous medium, and an 
aqueous resin dispersion obtained by the process. It is known that a stable aqueous resin dispersion 
can be obtained by carrying out normal emulsion 
polymerization using a vinyl monomer containing (meth) 
acrolein, and processes which are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
Application No. 4988762, Kobunshi Kagaku 1971, Vol. 28,  
 
No. 313 PP. 430 through 436, etc. are known. In the 
emulsion polymerization, since polymer conversion of the 
(meth) acrolein is not 100%, after a polymerization 
reaction is completed, it is necessary to distill off 
unreacted (meth) acrolein from an aqueous resin 
dispersion. However, with the conventional emulsion 
polymerization method, it is hard to distill off the 
unreacted (meth) acrolein from the aqueous resin 
dispersion. Therefore, aqueous resin dispersion obtained 
by the conventional emulsion polymerization method has a 
problem of a pungent smell and toxicological properties 
which are peculiar to (meth) acrolein. Further, in the case where a copolymer containing a 
lot of (meth) acrolein is prepared by the conventional 
emulsion polymerization method, a lot of oligomers whose 
number-average molecular weight (Mn) is below 1000 
originated in a homopolymer of (meth) acrolein is 
produced. These oligomers have toxicological properties, 
so the aqueous resin dispersion has toxicological 
properties originated in the oligomer. For this reason, the aqueous resin dispersion 
obtained by the conventional emulsion polymerization 
method has a problem of a difficulty in practical use. On the other hand, a polyvinyl alcohol group is  
 
peculiar synthetic resin which dissolves in water, and has 
a strong adhesive force and emulsification force, and 
forms a strong film. For these reasons, the polyvinyl 
alcohol group is widely applied to various uses. The 
applications are, for example, vinylon fiber, film, 
adhesive, fabric size, fabric processing agent, paper 
agent, emulsification dispersant, etc. Moreover, 
emulsified material in which the polyvinyl alcohol group 
is used as protective colloid, especially, polyvinyl 
acetate resin emulsion is used as coating material, 
adhesive, mortar binder, etc. Further, since starch is a kind of a polysaccharide 
group and has a strong adhesive force and forms a strong 
film. For these reasons, starch is widely
