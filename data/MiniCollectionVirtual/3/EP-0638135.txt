 TITLE PHENOLIC STAIN-RESISTS FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel compositions, useful as stain-resists for polyamide textile substrates, comprising water-soluble or water- dispersible base-catalyzed condensation polymers of bis-hydroxyphenylsulfone (BHPS), formaldehyde and a mercapto carboxylic acid; to processes for their preparation, and to polyamide substrates treated with said condensation products. The stain-resist agents of the present invention are more easily prepared, have improved lightfastness and color, and are more easily blendable with other stain-resists.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polyamide substrates, such as nylon carpeting, upholstery fabric and the like, are subject to staining by a variety of agents, e.g., foods and beverages. An especially troublesome staining agent is FD&C Red Dye No. 40, commonly found in soft drink preparations. Different types of treatments have been proposed to deal with staining problems. One approach is to apply a highly fluorinated polymer to the substrate. Another is to use a composition containing a sulfonated phenol-formaldehyde condensation product. Examples of phenol-formaldehyde condensates are described inUS 4,501,591, 4,592,940, 4,680,212, 4,833,009. These materials are either condensation products of naphthalene monosulfonic acids with BHPS and formaldehyde or condensation products of phenolsulfonic acid with BHPS and formaldehyde. To impart stain resistance and solubility, the presence of sulfonic acid groups is necessary in these compounds, and the amount of sulfonation must be carefully controlled. These sulfonated condensates are themselves colored, often a deep brown, which can present a shade matching problem to the colorist.Sulfonated phenol-formaldehyde condensation products are also subject to other undesirable color effects. Commonly they turn yellow on ageing after application to the fiber. Yellowing problems are described by W. H. Hemmpel in a March 19,1982 article in America's Textiles, entitled "Reversible Yellowing Not Finisher's Fault". Hemmpel attributes yellowing to exposure of a phenol-based finish to nitrogen oxides and/or ultraviolet radiation. To deal with 

the yellowing problem, the condensation products were modified by Liss et al in U.S. Patent 4,963,409 and by Marshall in U.S. Patent 4,833,009 to remove less active, highly sulfonated species. However, even after purification, yellowing remained a problem. Moss III et al; in U.S. Patent 5,015,259, disclose a stain-resist for polyamide fibers
