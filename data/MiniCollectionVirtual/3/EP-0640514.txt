<ABSTRACT>
A break-away retaining flap (32) for containing a 
deflated, folded-up airbag (30) in a rigid housing (12) of 

an airbag module (10) while a pivotable cover (34) is 
attached with fasteners (50) to close an open end (16a) of 

the housing (12) comprises a sheet of thin flexible woven 
fabric material having a first portion designed for 

attachment to the housing (12) along a line of pop-rivets 
(24) spaced away from the open end (16a) and a second 

portion adapted to be secured onto a row of fasteners (50) 
adjacent the open end (16a) of the housing while the cover 

(34) is attached. The retaining flap (32) holds the 
folded-up airbag (30) in place in the housing (12) during 

the assembly process and prevents crimping, binding or 
damage of the airbag (30) when the cover (34) is installed 

during final assembly. The retaining flap (32) has a 

weakened portion intermediately between the first and 
second attached portions defining a tear-away line adapted 

to facilitate break-away of the retaining flap into at 
least two parts when the airbag (30) is inflated without 

impeding the rapid inflation of the airbag (30) during 
deployment. An inflator module (10) including the 

retaining flap (32) and a method of assembling the module 
(10) are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
inflatable airbags utilized in motor vehicles and the
like and more particularly relates to a modular airbag
inflator assembly adapted to be mounted on the passenger
side of vehicle for protection of a passenger by inflation
of the airbag when a crash or collision occurs or
is eminent.The present invention relates to a new and
improved break-away retaining flap for holding and protecting
an airbag while in a deflated folded-up condition
within a rigid housing during and after assembly
and attachment of a cover to the housing which is
designed to tear and pivot open to release the inflating
airbag. One of the problems encountered in the assembly
of components into an inflatable airbag module
assembly is in maintaining the deflated airbag in a
proper folded-up condition after placement in a rigid
housing of the module so that the airbag does not get
pinched or damaged when the cover is installed in place.In addition, it is desirable to protect the
airbag after assembly of the airbag module has been completed
against damage from unwanted contact with the
cover and inside wall surfaces of the housing of the
module.However, any system for protecting the airbag
during and after placement of the airbag into a rigid
housing and attachment of the cover to the module as a
final assembly step should not restrict or impede the
rapid inflation of the airbag when deployed.Various proposals have been made in the past to address
at least one of these problems. Patents US 5121941 and US
5211421 disclose airbag modules in which a thin frangible
cover is secured between opposite sides of a mouth of an
airbag housing. In both of these modules the cover does not
protect the cushion against contact with the housing. In
the module of US 5121941 an airbag module door is connected
directly to the housing and in that of US 5211421 the door
is part of a surrounding dashboard and not connected
directly to the housing.A further airbag module is described in patent US
4964654 in which an airbag and inflator have to be
interconnected at an early stage of module assembly as they
are enveloped together in a rupturable sleeve and mounted,
in this state, inside a housing. A further airbag module is described in patent EP-A-0510738
(on which the pre-characterising part of claim 1 is
based). In this module a rupturable sleeve preferably
completely envelops a housing containing an inflator and a
folded airbag. With such an arrangement the inflator needs
to be installed at an early stage of module
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An airbag inflator module combination (10)
including:


a rigid housing (12) with an open end (16a) for
permitting escape of an airbag (30) upon deployment;
a folded airbag (30) in said housing (12); and
break-away retaining means (32) comprising thin
flexible sheet material for containing the deflated folded

airbag (30) in said housing (12),

   characterised in that said housing has fasteners (50)
for attaching a pivotable cover (34) thereto and in that

said break-away retaining means comprises a break-away
retaining flap (32) which extends over said airbag (30), is

attached by means (39) on a first portion (32A) within said
housing (12) away from said open end (16a) and is secured to
