<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a) a first controller (5) sensitive to the vertical speed (Vc) and to the vertical acceleration ( GAMMA c) of the body of the vehicle in order to derive a first virtual control signal for means of adjusting the suspension assembly, suitable for optimising the comfort of the vehicle, b) a second controller (6) sensitive to the deflection (DR) of the wheel and to its vertical speed (VR) with respect to the ground in order to derive a second virtual control signal of the said adjusting means, suitable for optimising the wheel/ground contact, and c) supervision means (10) sensitive to the first and second virtual control signals for deriving a real control signal applied to the adjusting means, in order to adjust the response of the suspension assembly depending on a predetermined behaviour strategy.
