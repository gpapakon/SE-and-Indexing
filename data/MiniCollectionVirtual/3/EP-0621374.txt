<ABSTRACT>
Soundproofing walls made from (extruded) acrylic sheeting, comprising supports and acrylic glazing sheets attached thereto which are free from halogen- and phosphorus-containing flameproofing additives and, on the surfaces of the sheets, a layer, from 0.1 to 100 microns thick, of a material which does not decompose and does not melt at temperatures of up to 250@C, for example silicon dioxide, are flameproof as specified in ZTV-Lsw 88 (additional technical specification for soundproof walls from the German Federal Minister for Transport).

<CLAIMS>
A flame-resistant noise-protection wall made of 
acrylic glass, comprising carriers and acrylic glass 

panes secured to said carriers, the acrylic glass being 
free from halogen- and phosphorus-containing flame-retardant 

additives, characterised in that on the 
surface of the panes, there is a layer of a material 

which does not decompose and does not melt up to 
temperatures of 250Â°C. 
A noise-protection wall according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the layer has a thickness of 0.1 

to 100 micrometers. 
A noise-protection wall according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the layer comprises colloidal 

silicon dioxide particles. 
A noise-protection wall according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the layer comprises a cross-linked 

organic polymer material. 
A noise-protection wall according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the acrylic glass 

panes are produced by extrusion. 
A noise-protection wall according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that longitudinally 

extending, tension-proof inserts are embedded in the 
acrylic glass.
