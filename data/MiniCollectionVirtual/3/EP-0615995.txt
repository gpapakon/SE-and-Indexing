<ABSTRACT>
The object is to prepare a high-molecular-weight polyester in such a way that it is possible to make even relatively small amounts of very high molecular weight available in an advantageous manner. This is achieved by preparing a polyester containing an alkenediol by continuing the polycondensation step to a viscosity number of 50 - 140 cm

>
/g and treating the resultant polyester with from 0.001 to 8 % by weight of a free-radical former which decomposes at temperatures in the range from 130 to 350 @C with a half value period of from 5 s to 120 min, and subsequently continuing the polymerisation to the requisite viscosity number. The process according to the invention allows high-molecular-weight polyesters having the desired property profile to be obtained.

A process for the preparation of high molecular 
weight polyesters by reaction of an aromatic 

dicarboxylic acid with a mixture of alkane- and 
alkenediols and in the presence of a catalyst, 

oxygen largely being excluded, characterised in that 
the polycondensation stage is carried out up to a 

viscosity number in the range from 50 to 140 cm
3
/g, 
and the polyester thus obtained is charged in a 

second separate stage with 0.001 to 8% by weight of 
an agent which forms free radicals and dissociates 

with a half-life of 5 seconds to 120 minutes at 
temperatures in the range from 130 to 350°C, and is 

then further reacted in the melt until the necessary 
viscosity number is reached. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the first polycondensation stage is carried out 

to a viscosity number in the range from 80 to 
120 cm

/g. 
A process according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the agent which forms free 

radicals is used in an amount in the range from 0.01 
to 5% by weight. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the agent which forms free 

radicals dissociates at temperatures in the range 
from 180 to 280°C.  

 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the agent which forms free 

radicals dissociates with a half-life in the range

characterised in that a final viscosity number of ≤ 

400 cm
