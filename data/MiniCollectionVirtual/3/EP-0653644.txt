<ABSTRACT>
A distance sensing system (10) includes an ultrasonic 
transducer (XM1), a transceiver (12) and a microcontroller-based 

signal processing unit (14). The transducer (12) 
periodically generates and directs towards the terrain a dual 

frequency ultrasonic signal. Echo signals from the ground 
and/or any intervening crop or trash are reflected back to the 

transducer (12) and are processed. The system generates 
amplified and filtered echo envelope signals. Leading and 

trailing edge times are determined as the times the echo 
signals cross a threshold value which is a certain proportion 

of a maximum echo amplitude value. A near distance value is 
derived from the leading edge time of the first echo which 

exceeds a minimum amplitude. A far distance value is determined 
as the trailing edge time of the last echo signal which has an 

amplitude which exceeds a certain value. Multiple echo time and 
amplitude values are derived from the maximum amplitude echo. 

These values are used to prevent echoes which occur after the 
multiple echo time with less than a certain amplitude from 

being used in the determination of the far distance value. This 
far distance value represents the distance to ground and 

weaker, earlier echoes from trash or crop and later, multiple 
echoes may be ignored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a distance measuring system
comprising a transceiver for transmitting a transmit signal
towards a surface, the distance to which is to be measured, and
for receiving echo signals reflected from the surface.Various systems have been proposed for measuring the distance
between a vehicle or machine part and the ground over which it
moves. This is desired in order to adjust the position of
working tools or implements with respect to the terrain or soil
surface. One such system is described in Australian Petty
Patent Abridgement No. AU-A-78449/87, published 10 March 1988
wherein distance to the soil is measured by reflecting an
ultrasonic signal off the soil surface. Variations in soil
condition and type are compensated for by deriving the distance
to the soil surface by averaging the leading and trailing edge
times of an amplitude envelope of an echo signal reflected by
the soil surface. However, this and other similar systems have
not been able to function accurately in conditions where crops
or trash lie on top of the ground surface. Accordingly, a
distance or height sensing system which can distinguish between
crop or trash and soil surface is desired.GB-A-2 173 309 discloses an automatic height control system for a header on a
farm implement, wherein the height of the header is continuously controlled in
response to the height of the crop on which the header is operating. The top of the
crop is detected by sonar detection units, and appropriate electronic and
electromechanical means are provided for controlling the height of the header in
response to signals from the sonar detection units, whereas noise, which may be
picked up by transducer units, is suppressed by an automatic gain control circuitry
in order to produce good signals.An object of the present invention as disclosed in Claim 1 is to provide a distance
sensing system which can distinguish between ground level and
trash or crop which may be lying on top of the ground.These and other objects are achieved by the present invention
which include an ultrasonic transducer, a transceiver and a
microcontroller-based signal processing unit. The transducer
periodically generates and directs towards the terrain a dual
frequency ultrasonic signal. Echo signals from the ground
and/or any intervening crop or trash are reflected back to the
transducer and are analyzed by the signal processing unit.The system generates amplified and filtered echo envelope
signals. The digitally measured amplitudes of these signals 
are
