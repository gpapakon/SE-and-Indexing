A multi-coordinate feeler head (1; 1
2
) with at least on feeler rod (4; 4
2
) capable of deflection in a
plurality of coordinate directions for f
eeling an object, wherein the feeler rod (4; 4
2
) is fixed in its
housing (2; 2
2
) by means of an elastic suspension (6; 6
2
), characterized in that the elastic
suspension (6; 6
2
) consists of a spring element (7, 7
2
) in the form of a plurality of leaf spring
arms (7; 7
2
) arranged in a star, wherein the leaf spring arms (7; 7
2
) possess at least one spring
component (7a; 7
2
a) running parallel to the feeler rod axis and one running perpendicular to the
feeler rod axis.
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1, characterized in that the leaf spring arms (7;
7
2
) comprise an offset (7a; 7
2
a) running parallel to the feeler rod axis and the leaf spring arms (7;
7
2
) run perpendicular to the feeler rod axis before and after the offset.
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1, characterized in that a plurality of spaced
spring elements (7; 7
2
) are arranged perpendicular to the feeler rod axis.
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1, characterized in that sensors (13; 13
2
) are
provided for detecting the feeling operation.
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claims 3 and 4, characterized in that the sensors (13;
13
2
) are arranged between the spaced spring elements (7; 7
2
) perpendicular to the feeler rod axis.
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 4, characterized in that the sensors (13) are so
arranged that their measuring axes intersect in a feeler origin which is formed by the centre (15)

of a feeler ball (5) which is located on the end of the feeler rod (4).
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 4, characterized in that the sensors (13
2
) are
formed as photoelectric length measuring devices and are so arranged that the optical axis of the

feeler head (13
2
b) runs at right angles to the measuring axis of the measuring rod (13
2
a) and
intersects the feeler rod axis in an origin (P
2
).
A multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1, characterized in that the leaf spring arms (7;
7
2
) are arranged in a cross.
