<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is an electronically commutated electric motor having high power and a high efficiency, which consists of a design which enables a constant ratio between the number of poles and the rotor diameter, and the corresponding control electronics. In one design solution, the electric motor on its own can be constructed with an outer rotor or inner rotor. The basic design idea of the electric motor is based on the conclusion that an optimum constant ratio between the number of poles and the rotor diameter comprises:  Number of poles/rotor diameter D (cm) = 0.6 to 2.0 The exact selection of the values for the ratio between the number of poles and the rotor diameter depends on the type of permanent magnet and/or the magnetic flux density Br, the rotor installation (internal rotor or external rotor) and the maximum rotation speed of the rotor (3). The stator poles are identical to one another, and the rotor poles are also identical to one another. In the case of the stator (2) of the single-phase electric motor, the number of stator poles is equal to the number of rotor poles, and in the case of multi-phase electric motors having one stator, the number of stator poles is at least two less than the number of rotor poles.
