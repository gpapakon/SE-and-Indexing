<ABSTRACT>
A medical instrument for removing deposits from artery and/or vein walls has an at least partially hollow body (10-14) which can be introduced into the blood vessels and which is provided with traction and/or actuating means (20) retractable out of the vessels and deposit-removing cutting bodies (21, 22) with cutting edges (24) oriented in the traction direction. This instrument consists of a base body (26, 27) which at least partially projects into the body (10-14). Cutting bodies (21, 22) oriented in the traction direction are joined to the base body; their operating and rest positions may be defined by displacing the body (10-14) in the traction direction.

Medical instrument for removing deposits in artery and/or vein
walls, having a body (10-14) which is at least partially hollow and is

insertable into the vessels, a tensioning and/or actuating means (20) which
is extractable from the vessels, cutting members (21,22) pointing in the

direction of pull and removing the deposits, said cutting members being
provided with cutting edges (24), and a basic body member (26 27),

which protrudes at least partially into the body (10-14) and on which the
culting members (21, 22), extending in the direction of pull, are pivotally

mounted, characterised in that at least two cutting members (21, 22) are
provided, which are configured as two-armed levers and together form a

pair of cutting members, the cutting members being provided with a
common pivotal axis (36) and a respective force arm (43) and a respective

load arm (44).
Instrument according to claim 1, characterised in that the portion
(30) of the basic body member (26, 27) protruding into the body (10-14)

is
configured as a tubular portion, in which a means (32, 34) for the relative

displacement of the body (10-14) relative to the cutting members (21, 22)
is disposed.
Instrument according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the means
(32, 34) is configured as a piece of tube or piece of wire which is

actuatable from externally. 
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the pivotal axis (36) of the cutting members (21, 22) extends transversely

relative to the direction of pull of the body (10-14).
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that,
in their inoperative position, the cutting members (21, 22) are

accommodated completely or approximately completely in the body (10-14).
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
the basic body member (26, 27) has a s
top portion (38) which, in the
inoperative position of the cutting members (21, 22), is disposed with

substantially no spacing from an end face (40) of the body (10-14).
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that
the body (10-14) is substantially configured as a hollow cylinder, which

accommodates the cutting members (21, 22) in their inoperative position.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that
the end face (41) of the body (10-14) remote from the user has an opening

(42) extending in the direction of pull.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that
the end face (41) of the body (10-14) remote from the user is convex and

smooth.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that
the internal wall of the body (10, 11, 12) has pressing members (46) 

which, in their operative position, are in pressure connection with the
respective force arm (43) and, in their inoperative position, are in pressure

connection with the respective load arm (44) of the cutting members (21,
22).
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that
the pressing members (46) are configured as radial projection members

with sliding curves.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that
the external profile of the respective cutting member's longitudinal section

is arcuate.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that
the means (32, 34), configured as a cable, piece of tube or piece of wire,

supports clamping members (48, 49, 50) which, depending on the
operational position of the cutting members (21, 22), co-operate with the

force arm and load arm (43, 44) of the respective cutting member (21, 22).
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterised in that
the clamping members (48, 49, 50) have a wedge-shaped axial cross-section

and face one another with their tapering end faces.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 14, characterised in that
two clamping members (48, 49, 50) are provided, between which members

the pivotal axis of the cutting members (21, 22) is disposed. 
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 15, characterised in that
one of the clamping members (50) is supported by the basic body member

(26) and is formed from a resiliently deformable material.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 16, characterised in that
the body (10-14) and/or the basic body member (26, 27) have/has

transverse bores (60, 61) for guide means.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 17, characterised in that
the cutting members (21, 22) define a hollow space (52) configured as a

chamber, through which the means (35) extends.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 18, characterised in that
the sides (54, 55) of the cutting members (21, 22) communicating with the

cutting edges (24) are provided, at least partially, with cutting portions.
Instrument according to one of claims 1 to 19, characterised in that
at least two pairs of cutting members (21, 22) are arranged in series.
