<ABSTRACT>
A device for filtering ECG signals, comprises an A/D 
converter (12) and a filter unit (14) connected to the 

converter's output. The filter unit comprises a filter, or a 
combination of filters with such a non-linear phase response 

that signals with frequencies in the passband of the filter, 
or the combination of filters, are delayed more than signals 

with frequencies in the transition band between the passband 
and the suppressed frequency band of the filter, or the 

combination of filters. A method for producing a FIR filter, 
with a phase response opposite to the phase response of a 

filter for filtering out DC components or an IIR filter, 
suitable for use in the above-described device in which the 

impulse response from the said filter (10) for filtering out 
DC components and low-frequency components or said IIR 

filter is reversed in time and sampled. The sampled values 
are then used for determining coefficients for the FIR 

filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for filtering ECG 
signals, comprising an A/D converter for converting analog 
input signals to a series of digital values, corresponding 
to the input signals at different times, and a filter unit 
connected to the A/D converter's output, said filter unit 
comprising a filter, or a combination of filters, with such 
a non-linear phase response, that signals with frequencies 
in the passband of the filter, or the combination of 
filters, are delayed more than signals with frequencies in 
the transition band between the passband and the suppressed 
frequency band of the filter, or the combination of filters. A device of this kind is previously known from WO-93/05573. Filtration of the signals is required for the analysis of 
ECG signals. The ECG signal recorded between two electrodes on the 
patient's body, e.g. on the arms and legs, also contains a 
DC potential, in addition to the ECG signal, which may be 
much larger than the ECG signal. These DC potentials or low-frequency 
signals vary because of relative movements of the 
body and the electrode as a result of e.g. the patient's 
breathing movements. Two-pass filtering is one way to remove these DC signals and 
low-frequency signals from the ECG signal. A filter with a 
linear phase is then provided by both forward and backward 
filtration of the signal with a filter with a non-linear 
phase, see e.g. GB patent 1 556 512, which describes this 
filtration with analog filters. A linear phase is desirable 
at the filtration, since phase distortion is then eliminated 
and, with that a minor distortion of the ECG signal's 
morphology results. However, a method in which the signal 
must be fed to the filter both in the forward and the back 
direction cannot straight off be used continuously, which is  
 
a major disadvantage when on-line filtering is desired in 
ECG examination lasting a longer time. The presence of high-frequency signals with small amplitudes 
on the microvolt level at the end of the QRS complex in 
post-infarction patients has been shown to be a good 
indication of an increased risk of future life-menacing 
ventricular arrhythmias, see. European Heart Journal (1991), 
12, pp. 473 - 480. High-pass filtration is needed in order 
to identify and analyze these late potentials. One problem 
is then the ringing induced by the QRS signal itself and 
which readily drowns out any late potentials. Several 
proposals to solutions of this problem have been presented.
