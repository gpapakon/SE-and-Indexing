<ABSTRACT>
Copolymer of ethylene oxide and of at least one substituted oxirane carrying a crosslinkable functional group. The copolymer includes ethylene oxide units, -O-CH2-CHR- units in which R is a substituent containing a reactive functional group capable of being crosslinked by a radical route, it being possible for R to be different from one unit to another, and optionally -O-CH2-CHR'- units in which R' is a substituent not containing any reactive functional group capable of being crosslinked by a radical route, it being possible for R' to be different from one unit to another. It is characterised by an excellent polydispersity value V = Mw/Mn and a statistical distribution of the various monomer units. The copolymer is prepared by an anionic copolymerisation process. The copolymer is useful for the production of a solid electrolyte which has good mechanical properties, good cation conductivity and good chemical compatibility with the electrodes of a generator functioning with alkali metals such as lithium and sodium.
