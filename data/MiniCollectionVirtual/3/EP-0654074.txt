<ABSTRACT>
Fatty materials are hydrogenated in a plate heat exchanger at a pressure above about 150 psig. The use of high pressure and high shear as provided by the appropriate surface to volume ratio and pressure drop in the heat exchanger, enables the fatty material to be efficiently hydrogenated, and for touch hardening the temperature can be reduced to minimize the formation of transisomers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydrogenation of fatty materials in 
a plate heat exchanger. Specifically, it relates to processes for 
lightly hydrogenating unsaturated fatty materials like fatty 
acids, fatty esters, etc., while maintaining a favorable trans-/cis-isomer 
ratio and/or hydrogenating to a very low Iodine Value. Hydrogenation of fatty materials is well known, having been 
described in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,073,380, Palmason ; 3,634,471, 
Kehse; 3,809,708, Minor; 4,584,139, Gray et al.; and 4,871,485, 
Rivers; Japanese Pat. Appln. 02/261,897; and Soviet Union Appln. 
1,142,505. The use of a plate and frame heat exchanger for 
hydrogenation is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,809,708. This invention relates to a process for hydrogenating unsaturated 
fatty acids and/or their esters in a heat exchanger of the 
type generally referred to as a "plate" heat exchanger, preferably 
one that has a solid outer shell construction, e.g., welded, so as 
to provide a vessel which can withstand high pressures, e.g., more 
than about 1 034 250 Pa (150 psig), the vessel having an internal configuration 
to provide high shear mixing under normal flow rates, and the 
process being run under a pressure of more than about 1 034 250 Pa (150 psig), 
preferably from about 1 034 250 (150) to about 3 447 500 Pa (500 psig), more preferably from 
about 2 068 500 (300) to about 2 758 000 (400 psig), the combination of high shear mixing 
and high pressure being sufficient to effect essentially complete 
reaction of the hydrogen used in the process, so that the amount 
of hydrogen used determines the degree of hydrogenation and the  
 
temperature can be lowered during "touch hardening" to avoid 
formation of the trans- isomer. The present invention improves the existing art processes by 
increasing the pressure and/or shear used in the hydrogenation of 
fatty materials (also referred to herein as "fatty reactants" 
and/or "feedstock") while maintaining the advantage of superior 
temperature control that a plate heat exchanger provides. The 
common heat exchangers, of the type used in U.S. Pat. No. 
3,809,708, are not suitable for optimum use, since they rely upon 
compression and a series of seals to maintain pressure. Preferably 
the heat exchanger is one that has a solid outer shell, e.g., 
one like those sold by Packinox of Louveciennes, France under the 
trade name Packinox, and by Karbate Vicarb, Inc. under the trade 
name Compabloc, the said heat exchangers being modified to have 
ratios of surface area to volume (S/V) of at

frame heat exchanger having a ratio of surface to volume of at 

least about 75, preferably from about 75 to about 300, more

preferably from about 2 068 500 Pa (300 psig) to about 2 758 000 Pa (400 psig), the pressure 

drop per meter being at least about 4 524, 2782 Pa, preferably from about
