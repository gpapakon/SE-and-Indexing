<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of an aqueous solution of 
polyamide-epichlorohydrin resin having low levels of epichloro-hydrin and related 
hydrolysis products, and to paper treated with such solutions. Paper so treated has 
improved wet and dry strength over paper that has been treated with polyamide-epichlorohydrin 
resin solutions that have higher amounts of free epichlorohydrin 
and related hydrolysis products. Furthermore, the paper product treated with 
aqueous solutions having low levels of free epichlorohydrin and related hydrolysis 
products contains smaller amounts of these chemicals that are suspected of being 
carcinogens and are environmental pollutants. Paper strengthening resins are sold commercially as aqueous 
solutions. Commonly such resins are thermosetting, polymeric reaction products of 
epichlorohydrin and a polyamide derived from a polyalkylene polyamide and 
certain dicarboxylic acids. US-A-2,926,154, to Keim describes aqueous 
solutions of such resins. Typically aqueous solution of such resins contain an amine 
curing accelerator such as ethylenediamine or diethylenetriamine. Such 
compositions are disclosed in Espy US-A-3,442,754. The presence of the 
accelerator makes it possible to thermally set the resin in a shorter time. Commercially such aqueous solution usually contain about 10 to 35% 
by weight resin. Most of the remaining portion of the solution is water. Such commercial aqueous solutions typically contain epichlorohydrin, 
dichloropropanol and chloropropanediol; the latter two compounds are hydrolysis 
products of epichlorohydrin. These compounds are suspected carcinogens and 
contribute to environmental pollution during the paper making process. A variety of references describe the removal of organohalogen 
compounds from water by use of various adsorbents including ion exchange resins, 
polymeric adsorbents, silica, alumina, clays, activated carbons, zeolites, etc. See, 
for example,

Arbor Science Publishers Inc., 1972, Ann Arbor); Ion Exchangers, K. Dorfner, Ed. (Walter de Gruyter, NY, 1991);  Amberlite® Product and Technical Bulletin, for Amberlite® IRA-93 
ion exchange resin, Rohm and Haas Co., 1981. The present invention is a process for lowering the amount of 
epichlorohydrin and related hydrolysis compounds that are contained in an 
aqueous solution of polyamide-epichlorohydrin resin, which comprises adsorbing 
epichlorohydrin and related hydrolysis compounds contained in an aqueous
