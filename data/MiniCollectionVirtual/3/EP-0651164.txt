<ABSTRACT>
The mobile telephone has a fastening device for hanging it on a carrier. The fastening device is designed as a lug which is connected in the region of a lug base to a housing of the mobile telephone. The lug can move in a sprung manner relative to the housing in the region of a lug head which is arranged facing away from the lug base. The lug is locked by a fastening element in the region of the housing. Furthermore, the fastening element engages in a fastening opening in the housing. In the region of one end, which projects beyond the lug, the fastening element is provided with an element head which extends over the lug originating from an element bushing. In the region of its end facing away from the element head, the fastening element is provided with laterally projecting fastening projections. In the region of the fastening opening, the lug is provided with lug webs which project into the fastening opening. The lug webs have laterally projecting lug projections which engage behind one edge of the fastening opening. The lug webs are braced with respect to the housing by means of an element shaft which projects into the fastening opening, originating from the element head.
