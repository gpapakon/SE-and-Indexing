<ABSTRACT>
Neutron absorber material and method of manufacture. The material comprises a homogenous boron carbide matrix (1) in which are dispersed calibrated boron clusters (3), for example pseudospherical clusters of 150 to 500  mu m, for example HfB2, which prevent the spread of cracks (F) in the material and improve its thermal shock resistance.

<CLAIMS>
Composite, neutron-absorbing material comprising a homogeneous, boron
carbide matrix, in which are homogeneously dispersed calibrated clusters

of at least one boride chosen from among HfB
2
, TiB
2
 and ZrB
2
, having
dimensions of 100 to 500 µm, the material also containing at the most

40 vol.% in all of HfB
2
, TiB
2
 and/or ZrB
2
 borides.
Material according to claim 1, characterized in that the material
incorporates 20 to 30 vol.% in all of HfB
2
, TiB
2
 and/or ZrB
2
 borides.
Material according to either of the claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that the calibrated clusters are solely constituted by HfB
2
.
Process for the preparation of a composite material according to any
one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the homogeneous mixing

takes place of a boron carbide powder having an average grain size below
5 µm with calibrated clusters of the boride or borides and then the mixture

is densified by sintering under pressure and at a temperature and for
a time sufficient for obtaining a final density higher than 90% of the

theoretical density.
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that preparation takes
place of the calibrated boride clusters from a boride powder having a

grain size below 5 µm by baking under vacuum or a neutral atmosphere of
the powder, followed by grinding and screening in order to separate the

boride clusters of 100 to 500 µm.
Process according to either of the claims 4 and 5, characterized in
that sintering takes place by hot uniaxial compression.
Process according to either of the claims 4 and 5, characterized in
that sintering takes place by hot isostatic compression.
Process according to any one of the claims 4 to 7, characterized in
that the sintering pressure is 20 to 200 MPa. 
Process according to any one of the claims 5 to 8, characterized in
that the sintering temperature is 1800 to 2200°C and the fritting time

is 15 min to 1 h.
