<ABSTRACT>
In order to position a container or a container preform made of thermoplastic, which has a neck (1) having an axisymmetric cylindrical inner wall, with a predetermined angular orientation onto a support mandrel (10) internal to the neck (1), the mandrel (10) having a mandrel body (11) and retention means (13) interacting positively with the neck (1) in order to render it integral with the mandrel body, the retention means (13) are mounted so as to rotate loosely on the body (11) of the mandrel so that the neck (1) is rendered axially integral with the mandrel body but free to rotate on it; a fixed stop (14) projects radially from the body of the mandrel, at a place on the latter having a predetermined angular orientation at least partly opposite a given axial portion of the inner wall of a neck (1) retained on the mandrel; a radial projection (9) is arranged, at least in part, at an angularly predetermined place on the axial portion of the inner wall of the neck (1); and relative rotation is caused between the container integral with the retention means and the body (11) of the mandrel until the radial projection of the neck (1) comes up against the fixed radial stop of the body of the mandrel.

A method for positioning a thermoplastic container or 
container blank having a neck (1) with a substantially 

cylindrical axisymmetric inside wall (2), with a predetermined 
angular orientation on a carrier mandrel (10) introduced 

inside the said neck (1), the mandrel (10) including a 
mandrel body (11) provided with retaining means (13) capable 

of interacting positively with the neck to secure the latter 
to the mandrel body, according to which : 


the said retaining means (13) are mounted freely rotating 
on the body (11) of the mandrel such that the neck (1) is 

axially secured to the mandrel body but free to rotate 
thereon, 
a fixed stop (14) is provided, projecting radially from 
the body of the mandrel and which is located at a point 

thereof which has a predetermined angular orientation and 
which is situated, at least in part, opposite a given 

axial portion of the internal wall of a neck mounted on 
the mandrel and retained thereon by the said retaining 

means, 
a radial projection (9) is provided, located, at least in 
part, at an angularly predetermined point of the said 

axial portion of the internal wall (2) of the neck, and 
a relative rotational movement between the container or 
blanck secured to the retaining means and the body of the 

mandrel is brought until the radial projection of the neck 
comes to bear against the fixed radial stop of the mandrel 

body, whereby the container or blank is brought onto and 
retained on the mandrel with a predetermined angular 

orientation with respect to the body of the mandrel. 
Method according to claim 1, the mandrel being movable 
and displaced in translation parallel to itself at the same 

time as it is given a rotation on itself,
 
characterized in that, once the retaining means (13) have 

been engaged positively with the neck (1), the rotational  
 

movement of the neck on itself is braked (16), leaving the 
mandrel body (11) free in its rotational movement on itself 

in order to obtain the said relative rotational movement 
bringing the radial projection (6) of the neck to bear 

against the fixed radial stop of the mandrel body. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the retaining means consist of a radially elastically 

deformable split ring (13) which is engaged freely rotating 
in an annular groove (12) hollowed out from the body of the 

mandrel (11). 
An arrangement for positioning a thermoplastic container 
or container blank having a neck (1) with a substantially 

cylindrical axisymmetric inside wall (2), with a predetermined 
angular orientation on a carrier mandrel (10) introduced 

inside the said neck, the mandrel including a mandrel body 
(11) provided with retaining means (13) capable of interacting 

positively with the neck (1) to secure the latter to 
the mandrel body, according to which : 


the said retaining means (13) are mounted freely rotating 
on the body of the mandrel (11) such that the neck (1) is 

axially retained on the mandrel body (11) but free to turn 
thereon ; 
a fixed stop (14) projects radially from the mandrel body 
(11), at a point thereon which has a predetermined angular 

orientation and, at least in part, is opposite a given 
axial portion of the internal wall (2) of a neck (1) 

mounted on the mandrel (10) and retained thereon by the 
said retaining means (13) ; 
a radial projection (9) is located, at least in part, at 
an angularly predetermined point of the said axial portion 

of the internal wall (2) of the neck (1) ; and 
means (16) are capable of bringing about a relative 
rotational movement between the container or container 

blank retained by the retaining means (13) and the body  
 

(11) of the mandrel such as to bring the radial projection 
of the neck (1) to bear against the radial stop (14) of 

the mandrel body (11), whereby the container or container 
blank may be retained on the mandrel with a predetermined 

angular orientation with respect to the body of the 
mandrel. 
Arrangement according to claim 4, the mandrel being 
movable and displaced in translation parallel to itself at 

the same time as it is rotated on itself,
 
characterized in that the said means capable of bringing 

about a relative rotational movement between the container 
or container blank and the mandrel body are arranged in the 

from of friction means (16) capable of rubbing against the 
container or container blank in order to brake the rotational 

movement thereof while the mandrel body continues to be 
driven freely in rotation. 
Arrangement according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the retaining means comprise a radially elastically 

deformable split ring (13) retained freely rotating in an

Arrangement according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the internal wall (2) of the neck (1) is provided with
