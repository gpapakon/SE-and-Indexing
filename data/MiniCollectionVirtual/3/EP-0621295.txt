<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to triethylenediamine
adducts of certain benzoic acid derivatives
and
their use as catalysts in thermosettable compositions.Thermosettable compositions are useful in many
applications including for example their use as adhesive
and coating compositions. Thermosettable compositions are
largely based upon epoxy and/or anhydride and/or acid
functionality. To prepare the thermosettable composition,
the curable resin is blended with one or more catalysts.
Depending upon the application, the catalyst can be
designed to provide a fairly rapid cure after blending
with the resin, or, the curing agent may be designed to
provide some measure of latency. That is, the
thermosettable resin does not gel over a period of time,
e.g. during storage, and only upon heating converts the
resin from a liquid (or thermoplastic) state to a tough,
hard thermoset solid. Various compositions have been used as catalysts in
thermosettable compositions. One group of curing agents
includes certain complexes of Lewis acids and amines. For
instance, U.S. Patent No. 2,824,083 describes certain
amine-BF3 complexes used as curing agents for
polyepoxides.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,933,422 and 4,614,788 describe the
use of certain adducts of imidazoles with organic acids
having pKa values of 0.5 to 5.0. U.S. Patent No.
2,824,083 describes the use of BF3 addition products
with certain amines, amides, phenol or ether, dissolved in
a liquid polyol such as a liquid polyalkylene glycol.
U.S. Patent No. 2,839,495 describes the use of the
combination of an acid anhydride and a BF3 complex such
as a BF3-amine complex to resinify polyepoxides.U.S. Patent No. 3,519,604 describes the use of a
polycarboxylic acid anhydride and certain 3- or 4-amino
pyridines in combination with a polyepoxy compound to form
a curable composition.Japanese KOKAI No. 64-3171A (January 6, 1989)
describes certain amino pyridine acid addition salts with
dihydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, used as accelerators
for curing epoxy resins.Additional background information on catalysts and
resins employed in thermosettable compositions can be
found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,816,500 and 4,871,806 and
European Patent Application Nos. 90308471.3 (Published
February 6, 1991) and 88119031.8 (Published May 24, 1989). A first aspect of the invention provides novel
triethylenediamine adducts that are useful in preparing
thermosettable compositions. The compounds of this
aspect of the invention are triethylenediamine adducts of benzoic acid
derivatives having the formula:
