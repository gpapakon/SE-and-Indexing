<DESCRIPTION>
 EPOXIDE-PHOSPHOROUS-CONTAINING ACIDS-CYCLIC ANHYDRIDE REACTION PRODUCTS AND THEIR USE IN COATING COMPOSITIONS.Background of the Invention Field of the Invention: The present invention relates to acid functional reaction products and to the use of these reaction products in coating compositions to promote adhesion and prevent yellowing-Brief Description of the Prior Art: Curable film-forming compositions based on resinous binders are well known to form protective and decorative coating compositions. Many of these coating compositions, however, suffer from poor adhesion particularly when the coating is exposed to extreme conditions, particularly high humidity conditions. Also, certain of the resultant cured coatings, particularly those in which the curing reaction is catalyzed with an amine, yellow on cure. It is known in the art that phosphorus compounds such as triphenyl phosphite suppress yellowing in cured coatings. However, such compounds have a tendency to cause blushing or a surface haziness when the coating is exposed to humidity.Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, an acid functional compound which is the reaction product of a monoepoxide, a phosphorus-containing acid and an anhydride is provided.The reaction products can be incorporated into curable film-forming compositions comprising resinous film formers which contain functional groups which are reactive with carboxyl groups and which have a tendency to yellow on cure. The reaction products are incorporated into the coating compositions in amounts of about 0.1 to 10 percent by weight based on resin solids of the film-forming compositions. The curable film-forming compositions which may be in liquid or powder form are depositable on substrates to form films, 

particularly clear films, and may be applied to form a composite coating which comprises applying to a substrate a colored film-forming composition to form a basecoat followed by applying to said basecoat the clear film-forming composition to form a transparent topcoat over the basecoat.Detailed Description Suitable monoepoxides which are useful in the practice of the invention are those which contain greater than 5 carbon atoms. Examples of such epoxy compounds are 1,2-eρoxy compounds such as glycidyl esters and ethers, preferably those containing from 8 to 30 carbon atoms. Examples of glycidyl ethers are glycidyl ethers of alcohols and phenols such as butyl glycidyl ether, octyl glycidyl ether, phenyl glycidyl ether and para-(tertiary-butyl) phenyl
