<ABSTRACT>
A method for fabricating a semiconductor device including providing a
semiconductor device (8) having a substrate (10) and at least one

semiconductor layer (12) thereon, damaging a portion of the semiconductor
device thereby creating a plurality of trap sites (14) in the portion of the

semiconductor device, and avoiding removing the trap sites during any
further processing of the semiconductor device. The damaging step may be

by injecting ions into a doped semiconductor region, reactive ion etching, ion
bombardment or ion implantation at an energy of at least 120 KeV and atoms

at least as large as arsenic. The damaged region may be one or more of a
doped semiconductor region (12) or a conductive layer (16) insulatively

disposed over a doped semiconductor region. The step of avoiding removing
the trap sites includes avoiding annealing, flash-lamp annealing for less than

10 seconds, annealing at a temperature of less than 900°C for less than 30
minutes and forming a diffusion barrier of metal or silicon nitride over the

damaged portion of the semiconductor device and diffusing hydrogen into the
semiconductor device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, and 
more particularly, to semiconductor devices that intentionally employ traps 
and methods for fabricating such semiconductor devices. As semiconductor device sizes become increasingly small, some effects 
become more and more significant. One such effect is the hot hole and/or hot 
electron effect. Hot electrons are electrons which have sufficient energy to 
travel through oxides and the silicon substrate thereby damaging the 
material through which it travels. When these energetic electrons damage 
the materials in a transistor (or other semiconductor device) or become 
trapped in the gate oxide, the transistor (or semiconductor device) 
parameters are changed. Hot holes result from the interaction of the mobile electrons in the 
material, or from the generation of hot electrons (current in opposite 
directions), with imperfections in the substrate or imperfections at the 
oxide/substrate interface. Such imperfections require the least energy for hot 
hole/electrons to change the transistor or semiconductor device 
characteristics, i.e., Vt. The smaller the transistor or semiconductor device, 
the more pronounced the effect. To minimize the effect, transistor structures 
are built in such a way that the junction is not abrupt. That is, the doping 
level of the junction changes as it approaches the gate edge of a transistor. A 
transistor with a graded junction is said to have a lightly doped drain (LDD) 
configuration. To alter the doping profile of the junction, first the transistor is  
 
formed. That is, a polysilicon gate oxide stack is formed over the silicon 
substrate. Typically, an implant is done after this step to provide a light 
dopant level next to the gate edge which in subsequent heating steps will be 
driven in under the gate edge to make electrical contact with the electrically 
active area of the gate. Next a sidewall oxide is formed as a spacer to force the subsequent 
implants away from the gate edge. Typically a heavy dopant level is 
implanted in the substrate to form the conductive region called a moat. The 
heavily implanted region may have more than one dopant with different 
diffusion constants to further grade the junction. During the anneal step, the 
implanted dopants in the moat diffuse under the sidewall oxide to complete 
the electrical connection to the gate. Studies have shown that simply providing a graded junction is not 
enough to prevent the transistor from being degraded by hot carriers. The
