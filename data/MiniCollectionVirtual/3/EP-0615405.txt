<ABSTRACT>
The system has four longitudinal faces (2-5) of a profiled assembly rail (1) constituting directional planes for all tools and transfer devices of the system. Along three of their edges, T-section grooves (6-8) extend with their centre lines angled at 45 deg. to the planes. The fourth edge (9) is grooveless and serves as a guide for a block (10) secured by a screw (15) with two edges (13,14) against the longitudinal faces. A magazine (20) slides in a channel (19) along the top of the block, with crossbars (22) for precise positioning of components to be treated.

<CLAIMS>
Machining and assembling system for entail components, 
having a continuous, profiled assembly rail as 

carrying apparatus for tools and having a transport 
apparatus for conveying the small components along the 

carrying apparatus, characterized in that the said continuous, 
profiled assembly rail (1) has at least two 

longitudinal sides (2, 3, 4, 5) which extend at right 
angles to one another as directional planes and at least 

one longitudinal groove (6, 7, 8) machined diagonally in 
each case between the directional planes in the region of 

the common line of intersection, and in that the tools 
and the transport apparatus are in each case arranged 

by means of corresponding fastening devices (10, 26, 29, 44) 
along the assembly rail (1), are aligned with two mutually 

perpendicular directional planes and are clamped by 
means of fastening elements (15, 16) anchored in a 

longitudinal groove (6, 7, 8). 
Machining and assembling system according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the longitudinal grooves 

(6, 7, 8) have an undercut profile, preferably a T-profile, 
in which nuts are held such that they can be 

displaced in the longitudinal direction of the assembly 
rail (1). 
Machining and assembling system according to 
Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the assembly rail (1) 

has in principle a rectangular or square cross-section 
having four directional planes (2, 3, 4, 5) extending at 

right angles to one another, and in that longitudinal 
grooves (6, 7, 8) are in each case machined in at least 

three longitudinal edge regions.  
 
Machining and assembling system according to one 
of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that one longitudinal 

edge (9) of the assembly rail serves as a guide edge for 
the transport apparatus, in that a region adjoining this 

guide edge of a vertical directional plane (2), together 
with a longitudinal rail system (10) fastened on the 

assembly rail (1), forms a guide channel (19) in which 
the components (28) can be moved along the assembly rail 

by means of an advance apparatus. 
Machining and assembling system according to 
Claim 4, characterized in that the components (28) are 

seated on subdivided rod magazines (20) which are pushed 
further in the guide channel (19), in each case by a 

predetermined scale division, at a given production cycle 
rate. 
Machining and assembling system according to 
Claim 5, characterized in that underneath the guide 

channel (19) there is arranged an advance strip (23) 
which carries out a combined lifting and advancing 

movement at the cycle rate and, during the advance, is in 
each case brought into engagement with the magazine (20) 

via an actuating tooth (25). 
Machining and assembling system according to one 
of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that, for the transport 

and tool operating movements, linear drives (31, 32, 
40, 59, 60, 61), whose longitudinal motion can if necessary 

be converted via a joint into a rotary motion, are in 
each case fastened on the assembly rail (1). 
Machining and assembling system according to 
Claim 7, characterized in that the linear drives (31, 32, 

40, 59, 60, 61) in each case operate in one of the three 
principal axes of a cartesian coordinate system which are 

in each case parallel or at right angles to the directional 
planes of the assembly rail (1). 
Machining and assembling system according to one 
of Claims 6 to 8, characterized in that a rectangular 

motion for an advance strip (23) is produced via linear 
drives (59, 60, 61) which are at right angles to one  

 
another. 
Machining and assembling system according to one 
of Claims 7 to 9, characterized in that provision is made 

of a lifting and clamping device (46) which can be moved 
at right angles to the advance direction via a linear 

drive (40), two clamping jaws (48) being pretensioned by 
spring force at right angles to the direction of motion 

and being able to be changed with respect to their mutual 
position, as a function of the height position, by means 

of a curved guide.
