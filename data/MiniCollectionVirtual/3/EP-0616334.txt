<ABSTRACT>
A flash memory includes a semiconductor substrate having a first conductivity type; a first well having a second conductivity 
type opposite to the first conductivity type, and so formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate as to be contained in 

the semiconductor substrate; a second well having the first conductivity type and so formed on the surface of the first well as to 
be contained in the first well; a plurality of memory cells formed in the second well, each having a floating gate; and an erase 

portion for erasing charge stored in the memory cells by dissipating it into the channel region of the second well through a tunnel 
insulating film. The erase portion applies a first erase signal to the first well in response to a start signal instructing the start of 

erase, applies a second erase signal having the same polarity as that of the first erase signal to the second well, and the first erase 
signal is applied earlier than the second erase signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
electrically erasable non-volatile semiconductor memory
devices (EEPROMs), and more particularly to a so-called
flash memory that stores information in the form of
electric charges accumulated in a floating gate.Recently, intensive efforts are being made on
research and development of so-called flash memories.
Flash memories, having a compact and solid
construction, are expected to replace bulky and fragile
conventional hard disk devices in various computers
including laptops. As each memory cell in the flash
memory is formed of a single transistor similar to the
memory cell transistor of conventional dynamic random
access memories, flash memories can easily realize high
integration density and large storage capacity.
Further, flash memories lack movable parts such as
driving motors and consume little electric power.In flash memories, each memory cell has a
construction similar to a MOS transistor and includes a
source region and a drain region formed in a
semiconductor substrate. Further, there is provided a
floating gate between the substrate and a control
electrode such that the floating gate is insulated by a
thin tunneling insulation film, wherein the control
electrode corresponds to the gate electrode of
conventional MOS transistors. When storing
information, a predetermined control voltage is applied
to the gate electrode. Thus, carriers flowing from the
source region to the drain region are accelerated in
the vicinity of the drain region and are injected to 
the floating gate through the aforementioned tunneling
insulation film. The carriers and hence the electric
charges thus injected to the floating gate are held
therein stably and urge the potential level of the
floating gate at a predetermined level. As a result,
the flow of carries from the source to the drain is
controlled on and off by the carries stored in the
floating gate. In other words, it is possible to read
the electric charges and hence the information stored
in the floating gate by detecting the drain current of
the memory cell transistor. When erasing information
thus stored, a potential is applied to the control
electrode such that the electric charges in the
floating gate are expelled, simultaneously to a
potential that is applied to the semiconductor
substrate or to the source region in the substrate, for
extracting the electric charges from the floating gate.
As a result, the electric charges in the floating gate
are dissipated, through the aforementioned tunneling
insulation film,
