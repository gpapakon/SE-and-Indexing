<ABSTRACT>
A primer comprises a liquid epoxy resin, a hydrophobic 
polyamine compound, a thixotropic agent and a silane coupling 

agent. After coating the primer on a wet concrete surface of 
a structure, a reinforced fiber sheet or similar material can 

be attached to the surface with a high level of adhesive 
strength, uninfluenced by the water. The reinforced fiber 

sheet is impregnated with a matrix resin and cured to achieve 
a satisfactory reinforcement of the concrete structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a primer for lining of 
wet concrete surfaces and methods for lining and reinforcement 
of concrete. The present invention relates for example to a method 
of attaching fiber sheet, cloth and non-woven cloth (mat 
etc.), using carbon fiber, glass fiber or similar materials, 
to a surface of a concrete structure, then having said fiber 
impregnated with matrix resin and cured to form fiber 
reinforced plastics. It relates more particularly to a primer 
for lining a wet concrete surface, and a lining method and a 
reinforcing method, permitting attachment of the fiber sheet, 
cloth, etc., with a satisfactory adhesion strength to a wet 
concrete surface of water-containing concrete structures such 
as bridge girders for river bridges, road tunnels, or quay 
walls in harbors. Attempts have been made to reinforce concrete 
structures with a reinforced fiber sheet comprising 
reinforcing fibers attached unidirectionally to a supporting 
sheet with an adhesive layer, where the reinforced fiber sheet 
is attached to a surface of such concrete structures as bridge 
girders for automobile and railway bridges, and impregnating 
the reinforcing fibers with a matrix resin and curing the 
same, to form a fiber reinforced plastics. The present 
applicant has previously proposed a  
 
reinforced fiber sheet suitable for such purpose and its 
manufacturing method as well as a method of reinforcing a 
structure using a reinforced fiber sheet (Japanese Patent 
Application Laid Open Nos. 3-222734 and 3-224901, etc). The impregnation of a matrix resin and the attachment 
of a reinforced fiber sheet described above may be done 
either by impregnating the reinforcing fibers of the 
reinforced fiber sheet with the matrix resin beforehand at a 
reinforcement work site and then attaching the reinforced 
fiber sheet on a concrete surface of a structure, or by 
coating a concrete surface with the resin, fixing the 
reinforced fiber sheet thereon and then pressing the same 
from above to impregnate the resin into the fibers. Or, such 
process may be used to treat the supporting sheet for 
affording a resin penetrating nature, spreading a primer 
over a concrete surface, and then attaching the reinforced 
fiber sheet. Later that resin is applied over the 
supporting sheet for impregnating the resin into the 
fibers. These processes have the following advantages: (1) 
resin can be impregnated into reinforced fiber materials at 
a reinforcement work site for reinforcement of concrete 
structures with
