<ABSTRACT>
To provide an E-O probe which can measure a voltage 
distribution in a fine region while enlarging it. A 

grounded, transparent electrode 2 and an electrooptic 
member 3 such as LiTaO₃ are successively fixed to and 

below a support 1. There are a plurality of conical, 
conductive members 5a-5e arranged below a reflection film 

4 in such a manner that the bottom surfaces thereof are 
fixed to the lower surface of the reflection film 4 and 

that the lower ends thereof project downward. Spaces 
between the plural, linear, electric needles 5a-5e become 

narrower toward a measured object located below them, 
whereby voltages in a fine region in the measured object 

can be guided as enlarged to the electrooptic member 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an E-O (Electro-Optic) 
probe and electro-optic voltage detector which can 
measure a voltage or voltage waveforms on electrical 
conductors. With an increase in fineness of semiconductor 
integrated circuits, potential measuring apparatus 
(electro-optic voltage detector) using the E-O probe 
utilizing the electrooptic effect are in the limelight as 
apparatus for accurately measuring voltage signal 
waveforms of elements in such integrated circuits. The potential measuring apparatus using the E-O 
probe are apparatus in which an electrooptic crystal is 
opposed to a measured object, the electrooptic crystal is 
irradiated with a light beam of linear polarization or 
circular polarization from the side opposite to the 
measured object, and the light beam reflected by the 
opposed end face (to the measured object) of the 
electrooptic crystal is led through an analyzer to enter 
a photodetector, whereby the beam is detected. The technology related to such E-O probe is 
described, for example, in Japanese Laid-open patent  
 
Application No. 4-29344. E-O probes may be so arranged that conductive 
members fixed to a electrooptic crystal on the measured 
sample surface side are made in the needle shape. In this 
technology using this needle shape conductive member, 
electric fields induced by potentials of wires or 
electrodes formed on a semiconductor substrate are guided 
with high spatial resolution through the needle shape 
conductive member to the electrooptic crystal. When a 
multitude of conductive members are made over the entire 
surface of electrooptic crystal, in case of a plurality 
of portions being measured, the total measurement time is 
reduced. However, if the plurality of conductive members are 
brought close to the measured object to measure a 
potential distribution in a fine region in the measured 
object with scan of laser light beam on the plural 
conductive members, the spatial resolution is very poor, 
because reflected light from a certain conductive member 
is measured simultaneously with reflected light from 
neighboring conductive members, using the laser beam with 
large beam size. Thus, high resolution measurement is impossible if 
the spaces between the wires or needlelike conductive 
members are narrower than the beam size. Further, high  
 
resolution measurement is impossible if a high resolution 
is desired for the potential distribution in the fine 
region in the wiring. Of course, thinning of the beam size can reduce 
interference from
