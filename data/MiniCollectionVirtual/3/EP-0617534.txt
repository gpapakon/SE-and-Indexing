<ABSTRACT>
A telephone subset with selectable DTMF signalling means and decadic 
dialling means, the subset includes a tone detector (7) to detect dial tone 

generated by the exchange to which the subset is connected, and processor 
means (4) to control the transmission of dial signals entered into a memory in 

the subset, wherein, when the phone is first connected to an exchange line (L1, 
L2) and a number consisting of a plurality of digits is dialled by a user of the 

subset and entered into the memory, the processor causes the first digit to be 
transmitted to the exchange as a DTMF signal, wherein the processor means is 

responsive to the tone detector to cause the rest of the digits to be transmitted 
as DTMF signals if the tone detector indicates that the dial tone has ceased, 

and wherein the processor means causes the plurality of digits to be transmitted 
as decadic pulses if the tone detector indicates that the dial tone continued 

after the first digit had been received by the exchange.

<DESCRIPTION>
When a call is made from a telephone, the dialled number is passed to the 
exchange and the exchange sets up the connection. There are two common 
modes of signalling to pass the dialled number to the exchange. 
1. Decadic dialling is an old method of signaling where the loop current 
flowing from the exchange and through the telephone is broken a number of 
times by the telephone. The number of breaks corresponds to the digit dialled. 
The exchange counts the breaks to determine the dialled digit. In Australian a 
'1' produces a single break, a '9' produces 9 breaks and a '0' produces 10 
breaks. The characters * and # are not supported by decadic dialling. Decadic 
dialling is gradually being phased out. 2. The second form of signalling is dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF). 
DTMF or Tone dialling consists of a unique pair of tones transmitted to the 
exchange whenever a digit is dialled. A total of 12 tone frequencies are 
required to transmit the digits 0 to 9, *, #. DTMF signaling is superior to 
decadic and is gradually replacing decadic signalling. Although modern exchanges will accept either DTMF or decadic dialling, 
older exchanges support decadic only. To cater for this situation, most phones 
provide a switch for the user to select the dialling mode. Some phones also 
allow for the dialling mode to be changed during a call by pressing a 'mode' key 
on the keypad. Generally the mode can be changed from Decadic to DTMF 
using the keypad but not the reverse. A problem with this arrangement is that if the phone is incorrectly set to 
DTMF dialling and connected to a Decadic only exchange, it will not be possible 
to establish a call. Also, the switch adds to the cost of the phone. The invention relies on the fact that when an exchange accepts a dialled 
digit, the dial tone is muted by the exchange to indicate that the exchange has 
accepted the digit. When the telephone handset is lifted the exchange 
provides an audible dial tone to signal that it is ready to receive dialling  
 
information. If the exchange is a Decadic only exchange and a DTMF digit is 
sent then the exchange will ignore the DTMF digit and continue to provide dial 
tone. By detecting the muting of the dial tone after dialling the first DTMF digit, 
the phone is able to determine if the exchange will accept DTMF dialling. If 
after dialling the first digit as DTMF the exchange continues to provide dial tone, 
then the exchange must be a Decadic only exchange. Subsequent digits are 
then dialled with the appropriate signalling

<CLAIMS>
A telephone subset having selectable DTMF signalling means and decadic 
dialling means, the subset including a tone detector to detect dial tone 

generated by the exchange to which the subset is connected, and processor 
means to control the transmission of dial signals entered into a memory in the 

subset, wherein, when the phone is first connected to an exchange line and a 
number consisting of a plurality of digits is dialled by a user of the subset and 

entered into the memory, the processor causes the first digit to be transmitted 
to the exchange as a DTMF signal, wherein the processor means is responsive 

to the tone detector to cause the rest of the digits to be transmitted as DTMF 
signals if the tone detector indicates that the dial tone has ceased, and wherein 

the processor means causes the plurality of digits to be transmitted as decadic 
pulses if the tone detector indicates that the dial tone continued after the first 

digit had been received by the exchange. 
A subset as claimed in claim 1 wherein, when the processor means 
switches the subset to the decadic mode, the subset remains in the decadic 

mode unless the phone is disconnected from the line supply, in which case the 
subset reverts to the initial mode of testing the response of the exchange dial 

tone when the subset is reconnected and a number is dialled. 
A subset having selectable dialling modes substantially as herein 
described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
