<ABSTRACT>
Releasable corner connection between two light-alloy profiles (10) located in a corner, with at least one groove which has a longitudinal opening, is undercut on both sides and has an integrally formed flange (16), and with a profile web (18) which is located in the longitudinal direction of the groove (12) at a distance from the undercut portion, the connection being brought about by a corner joining piece (angle bracket) (20), at least part of which can be inserted into the groove-like recess of the light-alloy profiles (10). The corner joining piece (20) has two limbs (26) located in the corner, each having an integrally formed spring-like portion, and each limb (26) of the corner joining piece (20) being secured to the corresponding light-alloy profiles (10) by at least two clamping screw connections, each screw engaging in a thread of a clamping plate (25) which can be inserted into the groove (12) from the front and the clamping plate reaching into the undercut portions of the groove-like recesses. In this arrangement, the limbs (26) of the corner joining piece (20) have at least two holes (24) which are spaced apart and are intended for receiving the screws (23) engaging in the thread of the clamping plates (25), as well as at least one pin-shaped element (28) which lies between these holes, is fastened to the corner joining piece (20) and is provided at its free end with a point. The free length of this pin-shaped element (28) is dimensioned such that it is longer than the distance between the profile web and the spring of the corner joining piece (20), which spring is situated in the groove-shaped recess of the profile, and the point therefore at least partially engages in a deformed portion of the profile web. The combination of the clamping screw connection together with the form fit brought about by the partial penetration of the pin-shaped element (28) into the deformation zone of the profile web results, according to the invention, in a releasable corner connection of two profiles (10) which can withstand high mechanical stresses in the longitudinal and transverse direction.

Detachable corner joint between two light metal sections (10) at an angle, 
comprising at least one groove (12) undercut on both sides and having a 

longitudinal opening with at least one moulded-on flange (16), and a profiled web 
(18) situated at a distance from the undercuts (14) in the longitudinal direction of 

the groove (12), the joint being produced by means of a corner angle (20) which 
can be introduced at least partially into the grooves (12) in the light metal sections 

(10), the corner angle (20) having two arms (26) at an angle each with a tongue-like 
moulded-on portion (22), and each arm (26) of the corner angle (20) being 

secured to the corresponding light metal sections (10) by means of at least two 
clamping screw joints, each screw (23) engaging in a thread of a clamping plate 

(25) which can be introduced into the groove (12) from the front and the clamping 
plate (25) engaging in the undercuts (14) of the groove (12), characterised in that 

each arm (26) of the corner angle (20) has at least two bores (24) situated at a 
distance (m) from one another for receiving the screws (23) engaging in the 

threads of the clamping plates (25), as well as at least one pin-shaped element (28) 
situated between these bores (24), secured to the corner angle (20) and provided 

at its free end with a point (30), and the free length (f) of this pin-shaped element 
(28) is oversized compared to the distance (a) between the profiled web (18) and 

the tongue (22) of the corner angle (20) situated in the groove-shaped recess (12) 
in the section (10) so that the point (30) engages at least partially in a deformation 

(19) of the profiled web (18). 
Corner joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the deformation (19) of the 
profiled web (18) required for the joint is a material deformation in the profiled 

web (18) caused by the forces transmitted from the clamping screw joints via lever 
arms (h) to the pin-shaped element (28), the lever arms (h) each being defined by 

the distance between the pin-shaped element (28) and the respective bore hole (24) 
for the clamping joint.  

 
Corner joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the corner angle (20) 
required for the joint is provid
ed at each arm (26) with at least two bores (24) 
required for the clamping screw joints with a centre distance (m) at least 3 times, 

preferably 6 to 18 times and in particular 6 to 12 times the bore hole diameter(s). 
Corner joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the pin-shaped element 
(28) required for the joint is arranged centrally between the bores (24) of each 

corner angle arm (26). 
Corner joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the pin-shaped elements 
(28) required for the joint are provided at least partially on their circumferences 

with a thread (32) and the pin-shaped elements (28) are screwed into the corner 
angle (20), the corresponding diameter of the bore in the corner angle (20) 

provided with a thread (32) being smaller than the bore hole diameter (s) for the 
clamping screw joints. 
Corner joint according to claim 5, characterised in that the pin-shaped elements 
(28) required for the joint are screwed in according to the required oversizing of 

the free length (f) of the pin-shaped elements (28) and are fixed in this position by 
means of a screw locking compound. 
Corner joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the points (30) of the 
pointed elements (28) required for the joint are made of a harder material than that 

of the sections (10) to be joined or the profiled webs (18) to be deformed or at 
least the deformation zones (19) thereof. 
Corner joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the profiled webs (18) 
required for the joint are deformed in such a manner that the pin-shaped elements 

(28) engage in these deformations (19). 
Corner joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the profiled webs (18)
