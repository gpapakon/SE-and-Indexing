<ABSTRACT>
The breathing equipment includes a mask (10) and an extensible harness (16) which includes an element which can be inflated by the breathing gas in order to extend it to a size which is sufficient for the user to engage it over the head, and manually controlled means (12) allowing introduction of the pressurized breathing gas into the inflatable element in order to extend it and to reduce the pressure in this element in order to allow the harness to be applied against the head. The equipment also includes automatic means for introducing pressurized gas for the component of the harness and for discharge of gas from this component, which means are controlled by a sensor detecting the force with which the mask is applied onto the face, so as to maintain an application force which is substantially constant, at least as long as the ambient pressure remains greater than a defined threshold.

Head respiratory equipment comprising a respiratory 
mask (10) provided with 
a demand regulator with air dilution 
connectable to a respiratory gas source, an extensible 

harness whose ends are connected to the mask and which 
includes an element (16) inflatable by the respiratory gas 

for being stretched up to a size sufficient for enabling the 
user to done it over his head, and manually controlled means 

for delivering the pressurized respiratory gas into the 
inflatable element for stretching it and to reduce the 

pressure in the element for enabling the harness to contact 
the head and forcibly apply the mask onto the face, 

characterized in that it includes automatic means for 
admitting pressurized gas into a component of the harness 

from the gas source and exhausting pressurized gas to 
atmosphere from said component of the harness, controlled by 

a sensor of a force applying the mask onto the face, for 
maintaining an application force which is substantially 

constant, at least as long as the ambient pressure remains 
higher than a determined threshold. 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said automatic means are further arranged to adjust the 

pressure in said component at a value which increases the 
force applying the mask on the face responsive to altitude, 

when the ambient pressure is under a determined value. 
Equipment according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that said automatic means are arranged to automatically 

fully venting the component responsive to ambient 
depressurization. 
Equipment according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said component is an 

inflatable ring (50) along an edge of the mask or an 
inflatable occipital cushion located between the inflatable  

 
element and the head. 
Equipment according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that said component is said inflatable element (16) 

itself or an additional element. 
Equipment according to any one of claims 1-5, 
characterized in that said automatic means comprise a 

housing (20) fast with the harness and a distributing 
plunger (24) fast with the mask, biased by resilient means 

(42) toward a first position where the plunger connects the 
element with atmosphere and biased by the tractive force of 

the harness toward a second position where it connects the 
element and the respiratory gas source. 
Equipment according to claim 6, characterized in that 
said automatic means further comprise a barometric capsule 

(72) for applying to the plunger a force which it brings 
into the first position responsive to depressurization. 
Equipment according to claim 6, having a regulator 
for delivering pressurized respiratory gas to the mask 

responsive to ambient depressurization, characterized in 
that said automatic means further comprise means (74) 

responsive to the pressure differential between the mask and 
the ambient atmosphere for causing a force to be applied to 

the plunger for bringing it into the first position 
responsive to depressurization. 
Equipment according to any one of claims 1-5, 
characterized in that the sensor is a force transducer (84) 

having an electrical output and in that the automatic means 
for delivering pressurized gas comprise at least one 

electrically controlled valve. 
Equipment according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized by means for adjusting the force 

applying the mask.
