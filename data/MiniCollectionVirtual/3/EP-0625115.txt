<ABSTRACT>
An infusion package (1) comprises an infusion containing pocket (2) defined between heat sealed together layers of tissue paper (4, 5). An integral, looped, handling member (3) is formed by a cut in the tissue paper around the pocket (2). In use, the handling member may be placed over the handle of a cup for example.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Infusion PackagesThe present invention relates to infusion packages, for example tea or coffee bags, and in particular but not exclusively to infusion packages which may conveniently be used in making a single cup of beverage.Infusion packages of the so-called "one-cup" variety have a handling member (hereinafter called "a handling member of the kind described") which in normal use hangs over the edge of a cup, mug or tea pot for example and by which the infusion package can be removed from the cup, mug or pot for disposal after infusion is complete. Traditionally the member comprises a tag having a length of string or web attached at one end to the package and having a paper tab attached to the other end for gripping by a user.The tag may be attached to the package in several ways, for example by stapling or by being secured in a seam of the package. The fabrication of a tag and its attachment to the infusion package significantly complicates and slows down the manufacturing process and adds to the cost of the package.In accordance with the invention there is provided an infusion package having a handling member of the kind described formed integrally with the package.By forming the handling member integrally with the package, the need for manufacturing steps to fabricate and attach a separate handling tag to the package is obviated. Furthermore it allows packages to be produced at a high production rate.Preferably the package is of the type comprising opposed sheets of porous tissue material joined to each other to define an infusion containing pocket therebetween, and the handling portion is formed from part of one or both of the sheets. In a particularly preferred arrangement, the sheets are sealed, most 

preferably heat sealed, to one another around at least part of the periphery of the infusion containing pocket, and the handling member is formed as part of or as an extension of the sealed area. This provides a two-ply handling member which is substantially stronger than a single ply member.The handling member may be integral with the infusion containing pocket of the package at one of its ends only, but, more preferably, it is integral at both its ends so as to form a loop which can in use be looped over the handle of a tea cup, for example, to suspend the package in the cup.To provide a compact arrangement which makes optimum use of tissue material, the handling member preferably extends around at least part of the periphery of the infusion containing pocket of the package, and most preferably

Claims
1. An infusion package comprising an infusion containing pocket formed between opposed layers of tissue material which are sealed together at least around part of the periphery of the pocket, the layers of tissue material defining a handling member of the kind described which is integral with the pocket.
2. An infusion package as claimed in claim 1 wherein said handling member is attached to said pocket at one end only.
3. An infusion package as claimed in claim 2 wherein handling portion is looped and integral with the pocket at both of its ends.
4. An infusion package as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said handling member is defined by a cut in said layers.
5. An infusion package as claimed in claim 4 wherein the end(s) of the cut defining the handling member terminate in an unsealed region of the tissue material.
6. An infusion package as claimed in claim 5 wherein the unsealed region extends across the whole length of tissue connecting the handling member to the pocket.
7. An infusion package as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said handling member is at least partly formed by two plies of tissue material which are not sealed together.
8. An infusion package as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the handling member is integral with the 


pocket of the package over a substantial length of tissue.
9. An infusion package as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the handling member is also attached to the pocket by readily frangible means arranged at one or more discrete points along its length.
10. An infusion package as claimed in any of claims 3 to 10 wherein the region of the loop remote from the join to the pocket is stiffened, for example by folding over the edge of the handling member or by adhering a stiffening member thereto.
11. An infusion package comprising two opposed layers of tissue materials heat sealed together to form an infusion containing pocket, the tissue material around said pocket being cut to define a handling member, a portion of which, at least, is formed from two plies of tissue material not sealed together.
12. A method of manufacturing infusion packages, comprising forming infusion containing pockets in a travelling two layer web of tissue material, the pockets being at least partly defined by sealed together regions of the tissue material, cutting the pockets from the web to provide individual packages, and, substantially simultaneously, cutting the web in such a way as to provide each package with an integral handling member of the kind described of two ply tissue material.
13. A method as claimed in claim 12 wherein the cutting is performed by passing the web between co-rotating cutting rollers having recess means to accommodate the pockets of infusion and co-operating cutting means. 


14. A method as claimed in claim 13 wherein the cutting means is formed by a ridge or lip raised around a respective recess provided on one of the rollers, which co-operates with an anvil surface formed on the opposed roller.
15. A method as claimed in claim 14 wherein the cutting roller is provided with a first cutting edge which defines the outer periphery of the package and a second cutting edge, spaced inwardly of the first cutting edge for defining therewith the handle portion.
16. A cutting roller comprising cutting means formed on the surface thereof for forming the outer periphery of an infusion package and substantially simultaneously therewith a handling member.
17. A cutting roller as claimed in claim 16 wherein the cutting means comprises a first, outer cutting edge defining the outer periphery of the package and a second cutting edge, spaced inwardly therefrom, for defining said handling member with said first cutting edge.
