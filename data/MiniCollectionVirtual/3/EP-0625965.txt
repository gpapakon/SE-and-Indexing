<ABSTRACT>
Prepare dry, moisture-resistant aluminum nitride powder that is uniformly coated with an yttrium-containing compound by (a) thoroughly mixing a slurry containing aluminum nitride powder, an yttrium-containing compound, and a solvent for the yttrium-containing compound in the absence of any surfactant and (b) removing the solvent from the slurry. The dry moisture-resistant aluminum nitride powder may be used in aqueous formulations to make ceramic articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to treated aluminum nitride powder, a method of 
treating aluminum nitride powder, and methods of using such powder. Ceramic materials are used today in many applications which cail for durable, 
tough, and heat-resistant materials. In making ceramic articles, a ceramic composite powder is 
often made by first wet mixing ceramic powder, such as aluminum nitride (AIN), ceramic 
composite components, such as binders, lubricants, sintering aids, and other processing aids in 
a solvent. Traditionally, when AIN powder is used as the ceramic powder, wet mixing is 
performed using alcohol or some other non-aqueous liquid as a solvent to aid in mixing. Water 
is generally not a suitable solvent for wet mixing with AIN powder because AIN is highly 
sensitive to hydrolysis. Hydrolysis liberates ammonia as a byproduct. Due to environmental concerns, water would be an ideal solvent for wet mixing 
AlN powder. If water were to be used as the solvent, no precautions would need to be taken to 
avoid exposure to the solvent during wet mixing operations. Additionally, containing the 
solvent and taking precautions to avoid the dangers of flammable liquids during and after 
mixing would not be necessary with water. WO-A-9006906 discloses a method of preparing an 
inorganic nitride or carbide particle having deposited thereon a substantially uniform surface 
layer coating of a metal hydroxide or metal oxide. The method includes (i) placing nitride or 
carbide particles into a solution comprising water and a surfactant that reacts with the nitride 
or carbide particles at a faster rate than the water, (ii) adding thereto an aqueous solution 
containing ions of a metal that will form the metal hydroxide or oxide, and (iii) increasing the 
pH of the solution of the metal and the nitride or carbide particles to deposit the metal 
hydroxide on the surface of the nitride or carbide particles. The nitride may be AIN and the 
metal hydroxide or oxide may be generated from salts such as yttrium nitrate. The method disclosed in WO-A-9006906 is not ideal for several 
reasons. First, it uses an amount of metal compound greater than that found necessary by the 
present invention. Second, it uses water or predominantly water as the solvent during the 
treatment step. Water may not be preferred due to the possibility of hydrolysis of the AIN 
powder. Third, the method uses a surfactant to coat the AIN powders. This may leave an 
undesired impurity in the ceramic. Some of the surfactants mentioned consist

A process of preparing an aqueous slip containing 
moisture-resistant aluminum nitride powder, comprising: 


(a) thoroughly mixing a slurry containing aluminum 
nitride powder, an yttrium-containing compound, and a 

solvent for the yttrium-containing compound in the absence 
of any surfactant,

moisture-resistant aluminum nitride powder uniformly coated 

with the yttrium-containing compound, and 
(c) dispersing the dry, moisture-resistant aluminum 
nitride powder and ceramic composite components in an 

aqueous medium wherein the aqueous medium is employed in an 
amount of from 20 to 80 weight percent and the dry, 

moisture-resistant aluminum nitride powder and the ceramic 
composite components are employed in a combined amount of 

from 20 to 80 weight percent, both percentages being based 
upon combined weight of the aqueous medium, the aluminum 

nitride powder and the ceramic composite components and 
totalling 100 percent.
