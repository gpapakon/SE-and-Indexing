<ABSTRACT>
In a color cathode ray tube apparatus having an 
electron gun assembly for emitting three electron beams 

disposed in one line, the electron gun assembly has at 
least first, second, and third electrodes (G5, G7, G9) 

applied with a voltage which changes in synchronization 
with deflection of electron beams. The first electrode 

and an electrode (G4) adjacent thereto form first eccentric 
lenses for deflecting a pair of side beams in a 

direction in which the side beams extend to be close to 
the center beam. The second electrode (G7) and an electrode 

(G6) adjacent thereto form second eccentric lenses 
for deflecting the side beams in a direction in which 

the side beams extend to be apart from the center beam. 
The third electrode (G9) and an electrode (G8) adjacent 

thereto form third eccentric lenses for deflecting the 
side beams in a direction in which the side beams extend 

to be close to the center beam. An electron lens common 
to the three electron beams is formed between the second 

and third eccentric lenses. It is possible to realize a 
color cathode ray tube apparatus which displays a high 

quality image over the entire area of the screen by 
means of these electron lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color cathode 
ray tube apparatus having an electron gun assembly of 
in-line type which emits three electron beams disposed 
in one line on one plane, and particularly, to a color 
cathode ray tube apparatus having an electron gun 
assembly of dynamic focus method by which good 
convergence is obtained over the entire area of a 
screen. In general, a color cathode ray tube apparatus is 
constructed to have a structure in which a fluorescent 
screen consisting of three color fluorescent material 
layers which respectively radiate in blue, green, and 
red colors, and the three electron beams emitted from 
an electron gun assembly is deflected by a deflection 
magnetic field generated by a deflecting apparatus, so 
that the above fluorescent screen is scanned in the 
horizontal and vertical directions, thereby displaying 
a color image. In this kind of color cathode ray 
tube apparatus, the color cathode ray tube apparatus 
typically uses three electron beams emitted from the 
electron gun assembly which consist of a center beam 
passing through a horizontal plane and a pair of side 
beams, which are disposed in one line on one plane. Also, in general, the color cathode ray tube 
apparatus of this in-line type uses an electron gun 
assembly which has three cathodes disposed in one line  
 
in a horizontal direction, electron beam generating 
portions respectively disposed adjacent to the cathodes 
in the direction toward the fluorescent screen, and a 
plurality of electrodes having an integral structure 
and forming a main lens portion. The main lens portion 
has a function of static convergence, and due to this 
function of the main lens portion, each of three 
electron beams is focused so as to form a small beam 
spot on the fluorescent screen. Simultaneously, the 
pair of side beams are so shifted as to be close to the 
center beam, and are converged onto one point of the 
fluorescent screen. Therefore, in an electron gun assembly of the color 
cathode ray tube apparatus having this kind of main 
lens portion, there is a problem that static convergence 
undesirably changes as a focusing voltage is adjusted. As a technique for adjusting the focus voltage and 
solving the problem of changes in static convergence, 
Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 1-42109 discloses 
means for performing a first orbit correction for 
deflecting a pair of side beams in a direction in which 
the beams extend to be close to a center beam near 
electron beam passing holes formed in the
