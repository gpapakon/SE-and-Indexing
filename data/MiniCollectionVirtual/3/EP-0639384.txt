<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the
manufacture of blood products and a method for the
manufacture of blood products.In the transfusion of blood to a patient, the
practice of separating the blood obtained from a donor into
various blood components as by centrifugation and
transfusing only necessary blood components into the patient
is prevailing today for such reasons as efficient
utilization of blood and relief of the patient from the
otherwise possible burden.The manufacture of blood products to be used for the
componential transfusion is accomplished by preparing a
multiple bag (compound bag) comprising a plurality of
flexible bags and tubes interconnecting the flexible bags,
centrifuging at least once the compound bag containing blood
thereby separating the blood into the three components,
namely concentrated red blood cells, concentrated blood
platelets, and platelet deficient blood plasma, transferring
the concentrated blood platelets and the platelet deficient
blood plasma out of the three components via tubes
respectively into a blood platelet storage bag and a blood
plasma storage bag, and separating the component bags of the
compound bag asunder by fusing proper portions of the tubes
and making cuts in the fused portions of the tubes.The series of works just mentioned is substantially
wholly carried out manually. By this reason or owing to the
use of the multiple bag, the procedure entails various
drawbacks as described below.When a blood center adopts for blood preparation a
procedure which ranges from blood collection through
manufacture of blood products, for example, it is required 
to draw up a rough plan for blood collection and prepare a
necessary number of bags severally proper in kind and shape.
In this case, the bags are known in numerous kinds including
a single bag, a two-piece bag, a three-piece bag, a four-piece
bag, and so on. Likewise, the bags for blood
collection are known in numerous forms (in terms of
construction and capacity of bag and number of connecting
tubes to be used, for example). The blood center,
therefore, is forced to spend time and labor appreciably in
preparing itself for the blood collection. It is possibly
prevented from securing blood components in necessary
amounts or compelled to waste surplus blood as when the plan
for blood collection is changed or when the plan does not
conform to the actual state of the site of blood collection.
In an extreme case, it must wastefully discard such bags as
are left unused.Further, prior to the blood
