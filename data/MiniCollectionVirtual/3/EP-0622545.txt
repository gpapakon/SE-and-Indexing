<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a multi-shell structure (13a, 13b) for the support of a gear pump rotor shaft in a casing. In this arrangement, the shells (13a, 13b) can be opened like pincers about a hinge part (47).

A gear pump with two rotors which have each a 
gear placed in a common pump space and at least one of the 

rotors, at least on one side, has a shaft (1) supported by a 
slide mounting relative to a case, flowing paths (5) being 

provided on the shaft (1) for the conveyed medium from the 
pump space to supporting surface (17) and along the latter, 

characterised in that supporting surface (17) is formed on 
the side of the case (9) by at least two shells (13a, 13b) 

defining respective cylindrical surface segments as 
supporting surface segments. 
The gear pump according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the azimuthal spacing of at least one 

pair of edge surfaces (15a
2
/15b
2
) of the shells (13a, 13b) 
extending
 axially and radially and facing each other is 
adjustable by means of locking members (29) or automatically 

by supporting reaction forces, and preferably in that the 
shells are spring (31) prestressed against each other and in 

the case of an automatic adjustment preferably adjustable 
(35, 31) limiting members are provided for the maximum 

spacing stroke. 
The gear pump according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the shells are connected so that they 

can be swung open (Î±) relative to each other like nippers, in 
the region of shell edge surfaces (15a
1
/15b
1
) turned towards 
each other and extending substantially axially and radially. 
The gear pump according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the shells are stressed towards the 

pump space against a case surface directed substantially 
radially, preferably by a spring (24) and preferably by means 

of spring tension devices (23) arranged on one side on the 
shells and on the other side on the case, and preferably by 

means of adjustable (25) spring tension devices. 
The gear pump according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the shells and/or the shaft have a 

continuous grooving (17). 
The gear pump according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the shaft leads through the case or  

 
runs into a collecting space for the conveyed or supporting 

medium. 
The gear pump according to one of claims 1 to 6 
for oils, plastic molten mass, rubber. 
A method for glide supporting of a gear pump 
rotor shaft, characterised in that the gap between the shaft 

and the supporting surfaces provided on the side of the case 
is mechanically adjusted either by means of manually 

adjustable members or automatically with instantaneous 
supporting forces.
