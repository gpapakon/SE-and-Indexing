<ABSTRACT>
An extrudable polyvinyl alcohol composition useful for packaging 
and molding applications is prepared by melt blending polyvinyl 

alcohol and thermoplastic modified starch to provide a product which 
has reduced water sensitivity, improved modulus and reduced elongation 

at high relative humidity. 
A method for extruding the polyvinyl alcohol composition 
comprises: adding sufficient energy to the polyvinyl alcohol 

composition to both melt it and essentially eliminate the polyvinyl 
alcohol crystallinity in the melt, and

 
   simultaneously removing energy from the melt at a rate 

sufficient to avoid decomposition of the polyvinyl alcohol. 
The thermoplastic modified starch may be added to the polyvinyl 
alcohol before or during the melting of the polyvinyl alcohol and 

elimination of its crystallinity, or the starch may be blended with 
the thus treated polyvinyl alcohol and then melt extruding the 

polyvinyl alcohol/starch blend.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to melt extrudable polyvinyl 
alcohol compositions which have desirable physical properties. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) is a water soluble, repulpable and 
biodegradable resin with excellent aroma and oxygen barrier properties 
and resistance to most organic solvents. Other desirable attributes 
of PVOH include anti-static properties, grease and oil resistance and 
heat sealability. The polymer is used extensively in adhesive, 
textile sizing and paper coatings. However, the end uses of PVOH have 
been limited despite its excellent chemical, mechanical and physical 
properties to those uses in which it is supplied as a solution in 
water. This limitation is partly due to the fact that vinyl alcohol 
polymers in the unplasticized state have a high degree of 
crystallinity and show little or no thermoplasticity before the 
occurrence of decomposition which starts at about 170° C and becomes 
pronounced at 200° C, which is below its crystalline melting point. With the present public concern for preserving the environment, 
it has been found desirable to search for materials which, when 
disposed after use, will physically or biologically decompose and 
thereby avoid polluting the environment. One candidate for such a 
material is water-soluble PVOH. U.S. Patent 5,051,222 discloses a method for making 
thermoplastic (melt extrudable) PVOH compositions which comprises 
providing sufficient energy to a PVOH which is at least partially 
crystalline to both melt the PVOH and substantially eliminate the 
crystallinity in the PVOH melt while simultaneously removing energy 
from the PVOH melt at a rate sufficient to avoid decomposition of the 
PVOH. The melt is then extruded, preferably into a strand, rapidly 
cooled and cut into pellets for subsequent thermoprocessing into the 
desired product or article. As a result of the availability of such thermoplastic PVOH 
compositions, the desirable physical and mechanical properties of PVOH  
 
such as biodegradability, water solubility and repulpability have 
opened new market opportunities for PVOH, especially in packaging 
applications where the contents must be dissolved or dispersed in 
water. Examples of such packaging applications for PVOH film include 
pesticides which are applied as a water spray, caustic cleaners or 
detergents which are dissolved during use, and process chemicals such 
as pigments, dyes or carbon black which are dissolved or dispersed in 
water. The advantages of using a water soluble film for packaging the 
above
