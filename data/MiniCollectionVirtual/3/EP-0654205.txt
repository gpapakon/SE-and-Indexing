<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to agricultural machines of the type including a body equipped with working implements and bearing down on the ground by means of wheels, and a drawbar designed to be connected to a towing (hauling, tractor) vehicle. This drawbar comprises a primary drawbar (13) designed to be connected to two lower lengths of the hitching device of the said towing vehicle, a secondary drawbar (14) connected to the body of the machine and a transmission and linking device (15) linking the primary drawbar (13) to the secondary drawbar (14) so as to be able to pivot one with respect to the other about an upwardly pointing axis (23). The primary drawbar (13) is linked to the front of the primary part (21) of the said transmission and linking device (15) by means of a first connection (45) of axis (24) pointing at least substantially in the direction of advancement (11) and, according to the invention, also to the rear of the said primary part (21) by means of a second connection (46) of axis coincident with the axis (24) of the first connection (45).
