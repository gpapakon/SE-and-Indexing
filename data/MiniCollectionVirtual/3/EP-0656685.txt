<ABSTRACT>
Wideband device for amplifying an electrical signal, including input means (L1) receiving this signal, an amplifier (T) to the input of which these means (L1) are linked, means (L12, Lm) for achieving feedback between an output signal from the amplifier and its input signal, the input means (L1) exhibiting a self-inducting resonance impedance, characterised in that the feedback means include means (L12) linked to the output of the amplifier (T), which are coupled by partial mutual induction (Lm) to the input means (L1) and which, at least in part, attenuate the resonance peak of the gain response of the device close to the cutoff frequency.

Wideband device for amplifying an electrical
signal including input means (L1) receiving said signal,

an amplifier (T) to the input of which said means (L1)
are connected, and means (L12, Lm) for achieving feedback

between a signal at the output of the amplifier and the
signal at the input of the latter, the input means (L1)

having a resonant self-inductive impedance,

characterised in that the feedback means include means
(L12) connected to the output of the amplifier (T)

coupled by mutual partial induction (Lm) to the input
means (L1) and which at least partly attenuate the

resonant peak in the gain response of the device in the
vicinity of the cut-off frequency.
Device according to claim 1 characterised in
that the feedback means also include resistive means

(Rctr1).
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the mutual coupling coefficient is

in the range 0.01 to 0.5.
Device according to claim 3 characterised in
that the mutual coupling coefficient is in the vicinity

of 0.1.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that it is integrated into a

monolithic component.
Device according to claim 5 characterised in
that the input means (L1) include at least one ribbon

inductor carried by a substrate and in that the feedback
means include at least one ribbon inductor (L12) carried

by said substrate in the vicinity of the ribbon inductor
of the input means (L1), the relative disposition and the

geometry of said ribbons assuring their partial mutual
coupling.
Device according to claim 6 characterised in 
that the ribbon inductor (L12) of the feedback means is a

line extending in a geometry which substantially
espouses, at least in part, that of the ribbon inductor

(L1) of the input means.
Device according to claim 6 or claim 7
characterised in that the substrate is a quartz or InP or

GaAs substrate.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that it constitutes a pre-amplifier

stage of a light signal processing system, the
amplifier (T) including at least one field-effect

transistor biased with a negative gate voltage (Vg) and
receiving on its gate the signal at the output of at

least one photodiode (Pd).
Use of a device as claimed in claim 9 for
optical telecommunication.
