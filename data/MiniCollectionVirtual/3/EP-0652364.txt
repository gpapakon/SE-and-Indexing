<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining engine load of a spark 
ignition internal combustion engine. The method includes the 

steps of charging an ignition transformer to a maximum 
ignition charge and initiating an ignition discharge betwe
en 
electrodes of the spark plug. The ignition transformer is 

then charged to a predetermined diagnostic charge which is 
less than said maximum ignition charge. The diagnostic 

charge is discharged at a time of the combustion cycle where 
pressure in the combustion cylinder is dependent on engine 

load. The duration diagnostic discharge is then monitored 
and subsequently correlated to engine load. In this manner, 

the spark plug is used as a feedback element in determining 
engine load. Further also detection of misfire, autoignition 

and preignition. Use is made of special CPP ignition transformers which 
are able to refire at short intervals. Multispark ignition applied 

during hard engine operating conditions e.g. cold starting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
automotive ignition system for an internal combustion
engine. More particularly, this invention relates to a
coil-on-plug ignition transformer which is capable of
being fired according to an algorithm to perform
various engine diagnostic procedures. The spark plug
mounted ignition system of the present invention
therefore operates as a feedback element of the engine
control system.In order to initiate combustion of an
air/fuel mixture within an internal combustion engine,
a spark ignition system generates a high voltage arc
across the spark plug electrodes at the appropriate
time in the engine operating cycle. The onset of the
arc across the spark plug gap is timed to occur at a
predetermined number of degrees of crankshaft rotation,
usually before the piston has reached top dead center
(TDC).If the spark timing is properly set, the
combustion process initiated by the spark plug action
will cause a pressure increase to develop within the
combustion chamber that will peak just shortly after
TDC during the piston's power stroke. If the spark is
initiated too late in the operating cycle (retarded 
timing), the pressure developed within the combustion
chamber will not be efficiently converted by the engine
into work. On the other hand, if the spark is
initiated too early in the operating cycle (advanced
timing), extremely high and potentially damaging
pressures and temperatures may result. The pressure
and temperature increases associated with advance
timing are also not efficiently converted by the engine
into a useful work output.Excessive advanced timing can also lead to
the occurrence of several other types of combustion
chamber phenomena. One such phenomena is auto-ignition
of the end gases and another is pre-ignition.Auto-ignition is a condition where the end
gases (the unburnt portion of the fuel-air mixture
initially ignited by the movement of the flame front)
explode spontaneously as a result of the cylinder
temperature and pressure becoming too high for the type
of fuel being burned in the engine. In response to the
sudden release of energy, the cylinder temperature
dramatically increases and the cylinder pressure
fluctuates, alternately rising and falling, as a
pressure wave travels back and forth across the
combustion chamber. When caused by auto-ignition of
the end gases, the rapid pressure and temperature
fluctuations are seen to occur after TDC. If the rate
at which energy is released through auto-ignition is
high enough, the exploding gases will
