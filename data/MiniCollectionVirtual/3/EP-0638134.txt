<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent material suitable for use as a medical or hygienic absorbent and comprises a non-woven fibre sheet having dense surface layers (10) and between these layers a less dense region where most of the fibres extend in the plane of the sheet. Transversely extending fibres (16) help to bind the material, the fibres also being bonded to some extent by a hot melt bonding material, e.g. core/sheath-type bi-component fibres. The material is made by forming a blend of fibres, including a minor weight of hot melt fibres, by cross-lapping a plurality of layers (14) to form a web, subjecting the web to needling at low punch density with penetration through the web, thereafter subjecting surface regions (10) of the web to higher punch density needling to form the dense surface layer (10) at each face from the web. The web is then heated, e.g. by high temperature air, to soften the hot melt material and to cause it to bond adjacent fibres while retaining its fibrous form and without significant shrinkage of the web as a whole.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with an absorbent 
material and method for making same and is especially 
concerned with absorbent materials suitable for use in 
medical or hygienic absorbence for the absorption of body 
fluids, for example in surgical dressings, sanitary 
products and incontinence products. There are described in EP-A-0 388 062 various 
absorbent materials of the type comprising a non-woven 
fibre sheet having a dense surface layer of fibres at 
each face of the sheet and, between the surface layers, a 
relatively low density region which, apart from an 
initial "tacking" operation, has not been subjected to 
any substantial needling. More particularly the 
preferred materials there described each comprise at 
least a major proportion of hydrophilic fibres, although 
there is also a passing reference therein to the 
possibility of producing absorbent material entirely of 
hydrophobic fibres. The preferred materials described in 
said specification utilised in particular a mixture of 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic fibres, the hydrophilic 
fibres serving to absorb fluids while the hydrophobic 
fibres provided a "scaffolding" for retaining the 
structure of the low density region, even under 
compression. In the case of the wholly hydrophobic fibre 
material, the fluid is believed to have been effectively 
"stored" within the structure rather than being absorbed 
into the fibres themselves. Although the absorbent materials described in 
detail in said specification have in practice proved 
generally satisfactory, nevertheless when fluid has been  
 
absorbed by the hydrophilic fibres in the web there 
arises a tendency in these hydrophilic fibres to 
collapse, especially under compression, so that although 
the use of hydrophilic fibres is believed to enhance 
absorbency, absorbent webs including hydrophilic fibres 
may tend to collapse and thus have a less than optimum 
absorbency and may even "wet back" when a load is 
applied, that is the absorbed fluid may be forced out of 
the material by the pressure. It is one of the various objects of the present 
invention to provide an improved absorbent material in 
which the disadvantages of currently available materials 
are mitigated. It is a further one of the various objects to 
provide an improved method of producing such materials. The invention thus provides, in one of its 
several aspects, an absorbent material comprising a non-woven 
fibre sheet having a dense surface layer of fibres 
at each face of the sheet and, between the surface 
layer
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An absorbent material comprising a non-woven 
fibre sheet having a dense surface layer of fibres at 

each face of the sheet and, between the surface layers, a 
relatively lower density region in which a substantial 

majority of the fibres extend generally in plane of the 
sheet, the fibres being bonded together, at least to some 

extent, by a heat-activated bonding agent in fibrous form 
which remains in fibrous form in the sheet. 
An absorbent material according to Claim 1 
wherein the bonding agent comprises a hot melt bonding 

material originating as one component of a bi-component 
fibre of the type referred to, the other component 

remaining in fibrous form in the sheet. 
A material according to Claim 1 wherein the 
bonding agent is constituted by polypropylene fibres. 
A material according to Claim 1 comprising a 
blend of fibres including 5 to 40% by weight coarse 

deciTex fibres, i.e. of at least 5 deciTex, the balance 
being fine deciTex fibres, i.e. of less than 3 deciTex. 
A material according to any one of the 
preceding Claims where the fibre layers are constituted 

substantially wholly by hydrophobic fibres. 
A material according to Claim 1 wherein the 
surface layers are less than 0.5mm in thickness. 
A material according to Claim 1 wherein the low 
density region provides at least 70% of the thickness of 

the sheet material.  
 
A method of making an absorbent material 
comprising forming a non-woven fibre web comprising a 

blend of fibres including a minor weight of a heat-activated 
bonding agent in fibrous form, subjecting the 

web to needling at a low punch density with the needles 
penetrating through the web, then subjecting surface 

regions only of the web to needling at a much higher 
punch density whereby to form a dense surface layers of 

fibres at each face of the web, and thereafter subjecting 
the web to heat in such a manner as to activate the 

bonding agent and cause it to bond to adjacent fibres but 
without destroying its fibrous structure and without 

substantially affecting the other fibres of the web and 
without causing significant shrinkage. 
A method according to Claim 8 wherein the web 
is subjected to heat by passing hot air through the web 

in sufficient volume and for a suitable period of time. 
A method according to Claim 9 comprising 
passing the web, after subjecting the web to heat, 

between rolls set at a fixed gap. 
A method according to Claim 9 wherein the web 
is cooled after having been subjected to heat by passing 

cool air through the web. 
A method according to Claim 8 wherein the low 
punch density is from  1 / 2 to 20 per cm
2
 and the high punch 
density from 100 to 1,000 per cm
2
