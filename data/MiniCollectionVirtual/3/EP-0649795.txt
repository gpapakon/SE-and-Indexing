<ABSTRACT>
An assembly for dispensing a fluid product includes a container (2) and a dispensing head (4) containing a dispensing channel (12) for the product to be dispensed, a closure system being located at the end part, opening to the outside, of the dispensing channel (12), the said system being formed by a shutter and by a seat (15), which forms part of a component of the dispensing head (4), the shutter consisting of an elastic blade (22) at least partially in contact with the seat (15) when there is no dispensing, moving away at least partially from the said seat (15) by flexing under the pressure of the product to be dispensed and returning through elasticity into its initial position when dispensing ceases, the shutter being subjected to the action of a constraint member which tends to bring it back into its initial position; the elastic blade (22) constituting the shutter forms part of a closure member (20) made from flexible material and the constraint member consists of a heel (21) possessed by the closure member fixed on the dispensing head (4).
