<ABSTRACT>
In a vehicle air conditioning system an air heating device (11) is positioned upstream of an air cooling unit (13). Upstream heating is used to load the air temperature before the air reaches the air cooling unit (13) so as to consequently increase the heat flux across the air cooling unit (13). The external operational temperature window for the air conditioning cycle is consequently widened because the system is able to tolerate a lower ambient external air temperature range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicle air conditioning.Vehicle air conditioning systems are known which comprise
evaporators positioned to cool airflow upstream of heater
units, which heater units are operable to add heat to the
air downstream of the evaporator when required. The
evaporator also acts as a de-humidifier for the air. Air
is drawn in from the exterior of the vehicle, or recirculated
from the vehicle cabin and directed through one
or both of the evaporator and heater dependent upon the
ambient conditions (such as the humidity or temperature
of the air passing through the system) and the system
requirements set by the passenger.The temperature difference between the refrigerant fluid
in the evaporator and the air passing -through the
evaporator provides the driving mechanism which causes
heat transfer to occur. The greater the ambient
temperature, the greater is the heat flux between the
ambient air and the evaporating medium; consequently the
easier it is for the refrigerant to achieve the required
enthalpy rise in the evaporator to effect full evaporation
of the refrigerant. When ambient temperatures are low
(such as in cold climates) achieving an enthalpy change
sufficient for adequate evaporation of the refrigerant in
the evaporator becomes a problem. A level is reached at
which ambient air temperature is so low that complete
evaporation is not possible. When this occurs, the system 
becomes increasingly inoperable because, amongst other
things, incompressible (un-evaporated) refrigerant can
enter the compressor driving the system.Attempts have been made to alleviate the above mentioned
problems by directing heat from other sources to heat the
refrigerant downstream of the evaporator.Examples of prior art vehicle air conditioning systems are
described in, for example, DE-A-19651279, US-A-5478274 and
JP-A-02041917.In particular DE-A-19651279 shows the preamble of claim 1.An improved arrangement has now been devised.According to the present invention, there is provided a
vehicle air conditioning system comprising:
i) an air cooling unit;ii) air heating means positioned upstream of the air
cooling unit; andiii) second air heating means downstream of the air
cooling unit, the second air heating means
comprising a condenser,
first heater bypass means (9a) is provided enabling at least some
of the air flow to bypass the first air heating means and/or
second heater bypass means (9b) is provided enabling at least some
of the air flow to bypass the second air heating means.The invention
