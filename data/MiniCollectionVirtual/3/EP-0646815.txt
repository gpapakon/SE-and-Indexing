<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of electrical traces (113) and a light emitting 
device (126) having a light emitting surface (127) is disposed on an 

interconnect substrate (112). A first optical part (135) 
having a first surface (137), a second surface (136), and a 

tapered surface (138) is disposed onto the interconnect 
substrate (112). The second surface (136) of the optical part 

(135) covers the working portion (127) of the light 
emitting device (126), a second surface (136) of the first 

optical part (135) is positioned parallel to the light emitting surface 
(127) of the light emitting device (126), and the 

tapered surface (138) extends from the second surface (136) 
toward the light emitting surface (127) of the light emitting device 

(126) for guiding light emitted from the light emitting surface (127) 
to the second surface (136).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to fabrication of 
optical devices and, more particularly, to manufacturing and 
fabrication of optical interface devices. This application is related to U.S. Patent having U.S. 
Patent No. 5,265,184 issued on November 23, 1993, that bears 
serial number 07/889,335, entitled "MOLDED WAVEGUIDE AND 
METHOD OF MAKING SAME" filed on May 28, 1992, which is 
hereby incorporated by reference herein. At present, optical interface devices are made using a 
variety of methods, such as photolithography, diffusion, ion 
implantation, or a combination of any of the above. Generally, 
these methods used for manufacturing optical interface units 
or devices are complex, inefficient, and are generally not 
suitable for high volume manufacturing. However, as use of 
optical interface units or devices increase, a need for a 
fabrication method and a structure that allows for efficient 
and cost effective manufacturing will be required. Further, use of conventional methods for manufacturing 
optical interface devices cannot provide sufficient flexibility 
for manufacturing large quantities of optical interface units, 
thereby making optical interface units difficult to be 
assimilated into standard electronic circuits and electronic 
components. As a result, these inflexible conventional methods 
limit the use of optical interface devices for interconnection 
applications in standard electronic equipment, thus use of 
optical interface devices in high volume applications are 
severely curtailed. Additionally, conventional methods for manufacturing 
optical interface devices require individual processing that is 
typically achieved by hand. Manufacturing optical interface  
 
devices by hand injects many problems into manufacturing, 
such as being extremely labor intensive, costly, and accuracy 
of workmanship that results in the optical interface units not 
being allowed to be manufactured in high volumes. Moreover, 
individual fabrication of optical interface units do not 
generally lend themselves to automated manufacturing, thus 
causing limited use of optical interface devices in electronic 
products. It can be readily seen that conventional methods for 
manufacturing optical interface devices have severe 
limitations. Also, it is evident that conventional methods for 
manufacturing these optical interface devices are not only 
ineffective, expensive, and complex, but also do not lend 
themselves to high volume manufacturing environments. 
Therefore, a method for manufacturing
