<ABSTRACT>
Digital modulation is applied to modulation means 1 to produce a modulated output 
from a voltage controlled oscillator 2 in a phase locked loop during transmission of a 

random modulating input. A component of the input voltage on coupling capacitor 18 will 
be due to half the swing between logic voltage levels but, when transmission ceases and 

a continuous logic 1 or logic 0 state is applied, the state of charge of the capacitor 18 will 
change causing an unduly large frequency swing on re-transmission. This is prevented by 

a biassing circuit comprising resistors 19, 20 fed by tri-state buffer 12 which hold the input 
terminal of the capacitor at the average level between logic 0 and logic 1 when no 

modulation is applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to modulators, especially to modulators for applying digital
modulation to generate modulated data outputs, for example, for use in transceivers
(transmitters/receivers) for use with a local area network.Modulators employing a voltage controlled oscillator in a phase locked loop are used
for producing a frequency modulated output e.g. of analogue signals such as speech.
Such modulators are also employed for modulating digital data.For example, such a modulator is shown in Figure 1. In the absence of a modulating
input applied to modulation means 1 i.e. if a continuous input of digital state 0 or digital
state 1 is applied, the output of the voltage controlled oscillator 2 is held to N.Fref, where
N is the ratio of a divider 3 and Fref is a reference frequency produced by a crystal
oscillator. Any difference between the output and N.Fref results in an error signal from a
phase detector 4 which is fed as an input to the voltage controlled oscillator in a sense
to reduce that difference. A low pass filter 5 removes noise generated at the voltage
controlled oscillator, while allowing desired modulation frequencies (outside the
bandwidth of the low pass filter 5) to modulate the output. The pass band should be as
wide as possible to remove as much noise as possible, yet not so wide as to remove any
low frequency component of the digital modulating signal which, in the case of some
digital signals e.g. N.R.Z. (non-return to zero) can be considerable.A problem with such a modulator arises in the case of a transceiver. Referring to Figure 
2, when the data consists of random 0 and 1 states the loop constrains the average
frequency to be N.Fref (shown dotted). During a period of reception, assuming that
modulating input remains (say) at digital state 0, the modulating output drifts over a
period of time, from the frequency corresponding to digital state 0 to the frequency
N.Fref. The output of course is not transmitted by the transceiver. The drift is faster the
greater the loop bandwidth. The problem arises when transmission recommences
(Figure 4). When the data logic state 1 is applied, the instantaneous output frequency
will shift by the total modulation bandwidth and will thus exceed the frequency value
corresponding to digital state 1. It will then drift back to frequency values centred about
N.Fref. The same applies if logic state 1 was applied during receive periods, and
retransmission commences with data logic state 0.A modulator of this type is described in US 4,609,886.The

<CLAIMS>
A modulator comprising modulating means (1) for applying digital modulation
via a coupling capacitor (18) to a voltage controlled oscillator (2) in a phase locked loop

to generate a modulated output, the coupling capacitor (18) having an input terminal and
another terminal, the other terminal being connected to the voltage controlled oscillator,

characterised in that the modulating means includes a biasing circuit comprising a pair
of series resistors (19,20) for connection to voltage levels so that the junction of the

resistors (19,20) maintains the voltage on the input terminal of the coupling capacitor
(18), when no modulation is applied, at the average value which is obtained on the input

terminal of the capacitor (18) when random modulation is applied, thereby minimising
distortion of the output when modulation is applied.
A modulator as claimed in claim 1, including a tri-state buffer (12) for feeding
the digital modulation to the biasing circuit (19,20).
