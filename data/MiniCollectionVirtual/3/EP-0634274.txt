<ABSTRACT>
A printing device has a simple mechanism for ensuring that a 
cassette having tape of a proper width is inserted into it for 

printing and for advising a microprocessor of the width of the 
tape. This is achieved by providing a switch with an 

actuating part which can be accommodated by a cassette of one 
type but not by a cassette of a different type.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing apparatus and is
particularly concerned with thermal printing apparatus which
receive tape holding cases housing a tape to be printed.Printing apparatus of the general type with which the present
invention is concerned are known. They operate with a supply
of tape arranged to receive an image and a means for
transferring the image onto the tape. In one known device,
there is a tape holding case which holds a supply of image
receiving tape and a supply of an image transfer ribbon, the
image receiving tape and the transfer ribbon being passed in
overlap through a printing zone of the printing device. At
the print zone, a thermal print head cooperates which a platen
to transfer an image from the transfer ribbon to the tape. A
printing device operating with a tape holding case of this
type is described for example in EP-A-0267890 (Varitronics,
Inc.). Other printing devices have been made in which letters
are transferred to an image receiving tape by a dry lettering
or dry film impression process. In all of these printing
devices, the construction of the image receiving tape is
substantially the same. That is, it comprises an upper layer
for receiving an image which is secured to a releasable
backing layer by a layer of adhesive.The upper layer can either receive an image on its top
surface, its lower surface being secured to the releaseable
backing layer by a layer of adhesive or alternatively the
upper layer can be transparent and can receive an image on one
of its faces printed as a mirror image so that it is viewed
the correct way round through the other surface of the tape.
In this case, a double sided adhesive layer can be secured to
the upper layer, this double sided adhesive layer having a
releaseable backing layer. This latter arrangement is
described for example in EP-A-0322918 (Brother Kogyo Kabushiki
Kaisha). In another type of printing device (described for example in
our European Application EP-A-0 573 187),
there are two separate tape holding cases, one
holding image receiving tape and the other holding an image
transfer ribbon.With all such printing devices it is desirable that they are
able to operate with image receiving tapes of different
widths. For this, the apparatus should include a way of
identifying the width of tape within the tape holding case so
that printing can be correctly carried out or inhibited where
an incorrect tape is inserted. For example if tape of a
narrower width is used, printing should be confined to the
area of the narrow

<CLAIMS>
A printing device comprising a zone (2) for receiving a tape
holding case (10) which houses tape (14) for printing, and a

switch (32) in said zone movable between at least first and
second positions, characterized in that said zone (2) for

receiving the tape holding case (10) is configured such that
when the switch (32) is in the first position, a tape holding

case (10) of a first type may be received in said zone (2)
without interference from the switch (32) but a tape holding case

(10) of a second type can not be received in said zone (2) due
to interference from the switch (32) and when the switch (32) is

in a second position a tape holding case (10) of the second type
can be received into said zone without interference from the

switch but a tape holding case (10) of the first type may not be
received into said zone due to interference from the switch (32).
A printing device according to claim 1 wherein the zone
comprises a tape holding case receiving bay (2) having a surface

(3) for a receiving a tape holding case.
A printing device according to claim 2 wherein the surface
is provided with a slot (40) and the switch has an actuating part

(34) which extends through the slot and above the surface (3) of
the tape holding case receiving bay.
A printing device according to claim 2 or 3 in combination
with a tape holding case (10) of either the first or second type,

wherein said switch further comprises an actuating part
(34) which extends above the surface (3) of the tape holding case

receiving bay (2), wherein a tape holding case (10) of the first
type holds tape (14) of a first width and is provided with a

recess (36) in a location which will receive the actuating part
(34) of the switch (32) when the switch (32) is in the first

position and a tape holding case (10) of the second type holds
tape (14) of a second width and is provided with a recess (36)

in a location which will receive the actuating part (34) of the 
switch (32) when it is in the second position.
A printing device according to any preceding claims which
comprises a microprocessor to which the switch (32) is connected

to automatically advise the microprocessor of the position of
said switch.
In combination, a tape printing device as claimed in any
preceding claims with a holding case (10) of either the first or

the second type.
In combination, a printing device and a tape holding case
(10), wherein said printing device comprises a zone (2) for

receiving a tape holding case (10) which houses tape (14) for
printing and a switch (32) in said zone movable between at least

first and second positions, characterized in that said zone (2)
for receiving the tape holding case (10) is configured such that

when the switch (32) is in the first position, a tape holding
case (10) of a first type may be received in said zone (2)

without interference from the switch (32) but a tape holding case
(10) of a second type can not be received in said zone (2) due

to interference from the switch (32) and when the switch (32) is
in a second position a tape holding case (10) of the second type

can be received into said zone without interference from the
switch but a tape holding case (10) of the first type may not be

received into said zone due to interference from the switch (32)
and said tape holding case (10) is one of said first and second

types and is received in said tape holding case zone (2), without
interference from the switch (32), said switch (32) being in the

first position if said tape holding case (10) is of the first
type and being in the second position if said tape holding case

is of said second type.
In combination with a tape printing apparatus, a set of tape

printing apparatus includes a zone (2) for receiving one of the 

tape holding cases (10) characterized in that there is provided
a switch (32) in said zone (2) movable between at least first and

second positions, the switch (32) having an actuating part (34)
