<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for 
infusing dried fruits by coating the dried fruits with 

an edible humectant containing gel. This process 
provides novel infused products using a minimum of 

energy with a minimum of damage to the infused product 
while maintaining a maximum of flavor of the dried 

fruit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This relates to a novel process for humectant 
infusion of dried fruits and to the products produced 
thereof. More particular, the present invention is 
concerned with coating dried fruit with an edible 
humectant containing gel providing a highly efficient 
infusion technique with a minimum of energy 
requirements, with a minimum of damage of the dried 
fruit and maintaining a maximum of flavor of the dried 
fruit. The combination of dried fruits and ready-to-eat 
cereal products, being dry and having relatively low 
water activities, tends to further desiccate the dry 
fruit. After a short time untreated dry fruit for 
example, raisins, bananas, peaches and the like tend to 
become unacceptably hard or at least become tough when 
packaged in the presence of dry products such as ready-to-eat 
cereals. The fruit which has been dehydrated 
sufficiently to prevent spoilage, is of the magnitude as 
to make the dried fruit generally unappetizing and 
unacceptable. To overcome this problem, the use of  
 
edible humectants to maintain the dried fruit in a 
softer more desirable condition over extended periods of 
time is well known and widely reported. A number of 
processes have been disclosed for infusing fruit with 
humectants by coating dry fruit such as raisins by 
spraying or immersing the fruit with the desired 
humectant or humectants as described specifically in the 
Background of the Invention in U.S. Patent No. 
5,000,971. One of the processes described is an 
infusion technique utilizes the process of immersing the 
dried fruit with the humectant in a wasteful manner so 
that excess humectants are forming pools over the 
extended period of time needed for the infusion to occur 
and these pools of humectants are generally not desired 
for reuse. Another process described is a spraying 
technique wherein the humectant is sprayed on the dried 
fruit over extended periods of time with losses of 
humectant on dripping from the dried fruit during 
infusion. U.S. Patent No. 5,000,971 is specifically 
directed to a process for carefully spraying without 
forming pools of humectants followed by tumbling the 
sprayed dried fruit and waiting four weeks for the 
infusion to occur. A major drawback associated with the 
immersion of dry fruit with a humectant especially 
glycerol with raisins is that an equilibrium is 
established where the glycerol is diluted with the 
components which come out of the raisins. Sugars, 
water, flavors and other components are the principal 
diluents. Removal of some of the

A process for infusing an edible humectant into dried 
fruit comprising 


(a) preparing an edible gel comprising a uniformly 
dispersed edible humectant present in amounts ranging 

from about 70 to about 92 weight percent, water in 
amounts from about 8 to about 30 weight percent and an 

edible gel forming substance; 
(b) treating said gel to provide a gel paste soft 
enough to spread evenly on the surface of said dried 

fruit, said gel paste having a viscosity which will 
adhere to said dried fruit and stable enough to avoid 

synersis; 
(c) coating said gel paste in a substantially even 
manner on said dried fruit, which has a moisture 

content from about 5 to about 50 weight percent; and 
(d) maintaining said coated dried fruit at 
temperatures from about ambient temperature to about 

160째F (about 71.1째C) for a period of time to provide 
the infusion of said edible humectant into said dried 

fruit. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the edible 
humectant in the said edible gel is present in amounts 

ranging from about 75 to about 90 weight percent and the 
water content ranges from about 10 to about 25 weight 

percent. 
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
edible gel-forming substance is selected from alginate, 

pectin, starch, gelatin, carrageenan and mixtures thereof. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the moisture content of said dried fruit ranges from 

about 10 to about 25 weight percent. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein said coated dried fruit is maintained at 

 
21.1째C to about 54.4째C) for a period of time to provide the 

infusion of said edible humectants. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the humectants are selected from glycerol, propylene 

glycol, corn syrup, dextrose, honey, fructose, high fructose 
corn syrup, and mixtures thereof. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein said dried fruits are selected from apples, bananas, 

blackberries, blueberries, cherries, melons, peaches, pears, 
pineapples, plums and raisins. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the dried fruit is raisins. 
A process according to claim 7, wherein said humectant 
is glycerol and said edible gel-forming substance is calcium 

alginate. 
A process according to claim 7, wherein said humectant 
is glycerol and said edible gel-forming substance is a 

starch. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein said edible gel-forming substance is pectin. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein said edible gel-forming substance is gelatin. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein said edible gel-forming substance is carrageenan.
