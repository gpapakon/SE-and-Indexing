<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to steam generators with a bank of curved tubes connected to a horizontal tube plate, the tubes which are closest together delimiting a central transverse region (64) known as the tube lane, which it is appropriate to obstruct at least in part by solid elements which limit the circulation of the secondary fluid around the tubes on the exterior of these. According to the invention, these elements are constituted by at least one block (62), accommodated in the central region and mounted pivotably on a fixed structural element (40) in the enclosure of the generator, making it possible to clear the tube lane and gain unimpeded access to the tube plate (12) in this region.

Steam generator, in particular for a nuclear power station, including an outer 
casing (10) of vertical axis, a horizontal tube plate (12), fixed in a leaktight manner 

inside and at the lower end of the outer casing, a bundle (24) of inverted-U tubes, 
comprising vertical branches, respectively hot (24a) and cold (24b) joined by a bent 

part at their upper end and passed through by a primary fluid which yields its heat, 
inside the exchanger, to a secondary fluid flowing through the outer casing, the 

branches of the tubes having their ends connected to the tube plate and emerging 
thereunder, respect
ively in an inlet manifold (16) for the hot primary fluid and an 
outlet manifold (18) for this cooled fluid, an inner casing (26) covering the tube 

bundle, the lower edge of which is separated from the tube plate and delimits with 
the outer casing an annular space (32) passed through by the secondary fluid 

introduced into this casing in this space before vapourising in contact with the tubes 
passed through by the primary fluid, steam extraction means, arranged above the 

bundle of the tubes in the outer casing, and means (40) for deflecting and 
distributing the flow of the second fluid, provided at the lower part of the inner 

casing, these deflection means delimitating with the tube plate, on the one hand, and 
the hot and cold branches of the nearest tubes, on the other hand, an elongate 

central region (64) extending transversely through the outer casing, this region being 
occupied by means for blockage or partial occupation of the passage afforded to the 

secondary fluid in this region, the said means consisting of at least one block (62), 
preferably of parallelepipedal general shape, characterized in that the said block is 

articulated on a fixed horizontal pivoting spindle (61) mounted inside the outer 
casing and extending perpendicularly to the midplane of the said region between 

the hot and cold branches of the tubes of the bundle, so as to allow tilting of this 
block away from the tube plate (12), uncovering the said region (64) above this 

plate.  
 
Steam generator according to Claim 1, characterized in that the pivoting spindle 
(61) is supported by a clevis (60) integral with the deflection and distribution plate 

(40) carried by the inner casing, extending parallel to and above the tube plate (12). 
Steam generator according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
parallelepipedal block (62) includes at least one open housing (63) capable of 

receiving one temporary immobilization pin (68) holding the block bearing on the 
tube plate (12), preventing it from rising under the effect of the speed of the 

secondary fluid flowing between the bundle of the tubes (24), this pin being slidingly 
mounted with respect to its housing. 
Steam generator according to Claim 3, characterized in that the pin (68) is 
supported by a closure cover (70) closing an access and visit hole provided in the 

outer casing (10) in the vicinity of the tube plate (12), substantially in the midplane of 
the central region (64). 
Steam generator according to Claim 4, characterized in that the pin (68) engages 
in the housing (63) of the block (62) after passing through a sliding closure member 

(76) carried by the inner casing (26), covering the bundle of the tubes, the pin 
including a telescopic mounting comprising a support, finger (71) integral with the 

cover (70) penetrating into a blind bore made in the pin, a return spring (74) being 
mounted between the cover and a bearing shoulder (73) on the pin, so as to exert 

thereon a continuous force for engagement in the housing of the block. 
Steam generator according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the 
pin (68) has a conical profile, capable of interacting with a similar profile of the 

housing (63). 
Steam generator according to one of Claims 5 or 6, characterized in that the 
sliding closure member (76) is supported by the inner casing (26) so as to be able to 

retract in the direction of the upper part thereof, after withdrawal of the pin (68) and 
release of the block (62), in order to allow free tilting of the latter.  

 
Steam generator according to any one of Claim 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
parallelepipedal block (62) is guided laterally in its tilting movement by two parallel 

slides (90), delimiting the sides of the central region (64) between the tubes (24) on 
either side of the block. 
Steam generator according to Claim 8, characterized in that the slides (90) are 
integral with the tube plate (12) or with the sliding closure member (76). 
Steam generator according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that 
the block (62) is made in a single piece, in the case of a generator of the boiler type 

(Figure 1), or in two parallel parts, in the case of an economizer type generator 
(Figure 2), the immobilization pin (68) being single or double and in the latter case 

straddling a vertical deflector (44) integral with the tube plate (12) in the central 
region (64). 
Steam generator according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 
the block (62) is formed by a plurality of juxtaposed elements (82, 84, 86), arranged 

in extension of each other in the longitudinal direction of the central region (64), 
these elements each including passage openings for the secondary fluid.
