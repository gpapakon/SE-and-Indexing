<ABSTRACT>
The upper frame 3 and a pair of the side frames 5 in the 
frame body 2 are simultaneously formed by bending the first frame 

plate 20 which is obtained from a raw flat plate by pressing 
treatment. And the upper frame 3 is formed into a pipe form 

having a slit 6 with edge portions and the slit 6 is welded at 
four positions corresponding to the bending portions 3B and the 

concave portions 9 in the horizontal portion 3C, thereby the slit 
connecting portions 10 are formed. Accordingly, based on that 

main members for constructing the seat back frame 1 are formed 
from the first flat frame plate 20, number of the members for 

constructing the seat back frame 1 and process number for 
assembling thereof can be easily reduced. And in case that weight 

of a driver is locally loaded on the seat back frame 1, the upper 
frame 3 can resist twisting moment occurring due to weight of the 

driver based on high rigidity produced from the slit connecting 
portions 10, therefore it can prevent the seat back frame 1 from 

being seriously deformed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seat back
frame which forms the rear backbone of seats installed in
vehicles such as a car, the seat back frame having a frame
body in which at least one side frame to support a driver
is arranged between an upper frame and a lower frame. In
particular embodiments, the present invention relates to a
seat back frame in which at least an upper frame part and
a pair of side frames can be formed by pressing and
bending of a flat frame plate.Various seat back frames have been proposed.
For instance, a seat back frame in which a pair of side
frames are arranged between an upper frame and a lower
frame, both being formed in a frame body, is well-known.
Such a conventional seat back frame will be described
referring to Figure 20. In Figure 20, a seat back frame
100 is constructed from a frame body 101 in which both an
upper frame 102 (the frame positioned at upper side in
Figure 20) and a lower frame 103 (the frame positioned at
lower side in Figure 20) are formed into one body, and a
pair of side frames 104 each of which is fixed to the left
and the right upper frames, respectively.In the seat back frame 100, the frame body 101
is formed into a predetermined shape, which is
substantially square and symmetrical to the right and
left, by bending a hollow pipe at first bending portions
101A, second bending portions 101B and third bending
portions 101C. In the thus formed frame body 101, the
upper frame 102 is formed by the part of the frame body
101 above the third bending parts 101C and the lower frame
103 is formed by the pair of lower pipes 103A, 103B which
are bend inwardly from each of the third bending portions 
101C. The end portions of the lower pipes 103A, 103B are
fixed to each other by welding.The side frames 104 are formed by welding both
ends of a pair of support wires to the upper frame 102.
The side frames 104 are formed to support the driver from
both sides of the seat back frame 100.Further, at a lower position of the right side
frame 104 in Figure 20 (the right lower position of the
upper frame 102), a reclining bracket 105 for connecting a
reclining device (not shown) is fixed by welding. And
similarly, at the left lower position of the left side
frame 104 (the left lower position of the upper frame
102), a hinge plate 106 is fixed by welding, the hinge
plate 106 comprising a hinge which is utilised for
reclining the seat back frame 100 in cooperation with the
reclining device.On inner sides of the upper frame 102 on which
each of the side frames 104 is
