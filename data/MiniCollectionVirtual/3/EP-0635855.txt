<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic 
material for high frequencies and, more particularly, to a 
magnetic composition of a calcium vanadium garnet system 
suitable for use in a range of high frequencies such as 
microwaves and millimeter-waves. As a magnetic material for high frequencies, there 
have been used those such as manganese-magnesium ferrites, 
nickel-zinc ferrites, lithium ferrites and yttrium-iron-garnets 
(YIG), calcium-vanadium-garnets, etc. since they 
have a saturation magnetization (4πMs) ranging from 500 to 
4000 gauss. Among them, calcium-vanadium-garnets are known 
to be a magnetic material with a low magnetic loss which is 
given by a ferromagnetic resonance absorption half-line 
width (ΔH). Thus, the calcium-vanadium-garnets make it 
possible to produce low-loss circuit elements such as isolators 
and circulators since they meet requirements for 
magnetic materials such that they must have not only a 
suitable value of 4πMs but a small ΔH. Japanese patent publication No. 49-15754 (i.e., 
JP-B- 49-15754) discloses a magnetic material for microwaves 
of a calcium-vanadium-garnet system in which a part of Ca is  
 
replaced with Y and a part of Fe is replaced with Sn to 
provide a composition expressed by the general formula: 
(Ca3-yYy)(Fe2-xSnx)(Fe1.5+0.5x+0.5yV1.5-0.5x-0.5y)O12 
where 0 < y ≤ 2.5, 0 < x ≤ 0.35y + 0.3, and 0 < 1.5-0.5x-0.5y. 
This material has a small saturation magnetization 
(4πMs), a small temperature coefficient of 4πMs and small 
ΔH. In proceeding papers, p 424, of a lecture in a 
national meeting of the electronics-communications society 
for the 47 year of Showa, it has been reported by 
Takamizawa et al. that substitution of Y and Sn for parts of 
Ca and Fe causes a variation of 4πMs, that a partial 
replacement of Fe with Sn lowers the anisotropic field and 
ΔH. However, such calcium-vanadium-garnet materials 
have a serious problem that a slight deviation of the 
composition causes considerable increase in both ΔH and 
dielectric dissipation factor (tan 6) and interferes with 
the practical uses. On the other hand, when the magnetic material is 
used for self-biasing phase converting elements or latching 
type phase shifters, it is required to have a large ratio of 
remanent magnetic flux density (Br) to maximum magnetic flux 
density (Bm), i.e., a large squareness ratio (Br/Bm), as 
well as small tan δ. However, the above calcium-vanadium-garnet 
materials cannot be applied to the phase converting  
 
elements since the greater Br/Bm the greater is
