<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording medium 
suitable for use in recording using water-based inks, ink-jet 
recording method and a dispersion. In Particular, 
this invention relates to a recording medium which can 
provide images high in optical density, bright in color 
tone and high in resolution, and has excellent ink-absorbing 
capacity, an ink-jet recording method using such 
a recording medium, and a dispersion of an alumina 
hydrate, which is suitable for use in production of the 
recording medium. In recent years, an ink-jet recording system, in 
which minute droplets of an ink are flown by any of 
various working principles to apply them to a recording 
medium such as paper, thereby conducting recording of 
images, characters and/or the like, has been quickly 
spread as a recording apparatus for various images in 
various applications including information instruments 
because it has features that recording can be conducted at 
high speed and with a low noise, color images can be 
formed with ease, recording patterns are very flexible,  
 
and development and fixing process are unnecessary. 
Further, it begins to be applied to a field of recording 
of full-color images because images formed by an multi-color 
ink-jet recording system are comparable in quality 
with multi-color prints by a plate making system and 
photoprints by a color photographic system, and such 
records can be obtained at lower cost than the usual 
multi-color prints and photoprints when the number of 
copies is small. With the improvement in recordability, 
such as speeding up and high definition of recording, and 
multi-coloring of images, recording apparatus and 
recording methods have been improved, and recording media 
have also been required to have higher properties. In order to satisfy such requirements, a wide 
variety of recording media have been proposed. For 
example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 52-53012 
discloses paper for ink-jet, in which a base paper 
web low in sizing degree is impregnated with a surface 
coating. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 53-49113 
discloses paper for ink-jet, in which a sheet 
containing urea-formalin resin powder therein is 
impregnated with a water-soluble polymer. Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open No. 55-5830 discloses paper for ink-jet 
recording, in which a coating layer having good ink 
absorptiveness is provided on a surface of a base. 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 55-51583  
 
discloses that amorphous silica is used as a
