<ABSTRACT>
In the purification of maleic anhydride obtained with an oxidation process, by means 
of absorption with an organic solvent and fractionation of the resulting liquid phase 

and purification of the crude maleic anhydride thus separated, the above purification 
being accomplished through two serially placed fractionating columns, the 

accumulation of polymerisable acrylic acid overhead the first fractionating column of 
the purification section, and of water as well as of maleic acid overhead the second 

fractionating column of the purification section, is avoided by carrying the overhead 
vapours of said first fractionating column to an absorption tower, preferably 

operating with the same absorption organic solvent used to absorb the crude maleic 
anhydride from the reaction mixture, and by carrying the overhead vapours of said 

fractionating column of said purification section to two condensers placed in series 
so that the gaseous fraction, coming out of the first condenser, is fed to said second 

condenser.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a process for the purification of maleic anhydride
and, more particularly, to a process for the purification of the crude maleic
anhydride resulting from the recovery by means of absorption with an organic
solvent of the same anhydride from gaseous mixtures obtained from butane and/or
benzene oxidation.The maleic anhydride is produced by an oxidation reaction in gaseous phase and is
obtained as a diluted and raw, gaseous form.A first recovery method consists in the water absorption of the maleic anhydride.
which reacts with water to form maleic acid.After the water separation by distillation and the dehydration of the maleic acid,
maleic anhydride is recovered.This recovery type involves, however, a high energy consumption, product loss owing
to conversion of maleic acid to fumaric acid, high amounts of pollutants in the
effluents and frequent plant stops for washings.Alternatively, since some time the recovery of maleic anhydride by absorption in an
organic solvent has been proposed.To this process, proposed in the U.S. Patent 2,942,005 describing the absorption of
maleic anhydride and phtahlic anhydride from reaction mixtures, several operating
improvements have been brought.In the US Patent 3891680, the gaseous reaction mixture (from which maleic
anhydride is to be recovered) is contacted with an organic liquid phase.A similar process is disclosed in the U.S. Patent 4118403, in which the maleic
anhydride is recovered by absorption in an organic liquid to which phthalic
anhydride is added.Finally, the U.S. Patent 5969687 discloses the maleic anhydride recovery by means of
an organic solvent and, in particular, includes a stripping step of the enriched
solvent with a gas of low humidity contents to remove water and volatile substances.
In all the procedures based on the use of an organic absorption solvent, the enriched
solvent is passed through a separator under vacuum, in which the raw maleic
anhydride is condensed overhead and the depleted solvent leaves from the bottom for
being recycled to the absorption phase.As already mentioned, this fractionating step is common to all solvent recovery
processes and leads to produce raw maleic anhydride of a 97-99% purity.The main residual impurities consist of:
(i) a small amount of solvent (ii) a certain amount of organic by-products formed in the oxidation reactor and
absorbed together with the maleic anhydride in the absorber, and(iii) water, either free or combined with maleic anhydride.Typical examples of light organic

A process for the purification of raw maleic anhydride coming from a recovery unit, of the
type wherein the gaseous reaction mixture (12) is subjected to separation by absorption in an

absorber (10) of the raw maleic anhydride by means of an organic solvent (42,14) and the
enriched organic solvent (18) is sent to a vacuum separation column (20), from overhead of
