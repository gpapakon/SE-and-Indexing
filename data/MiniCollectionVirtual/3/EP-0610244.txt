<ABSTRACT>
The invention is to make a pultruded rod (45) of fibers and fully cured resin which is of sufficient diameter that it possesses inherent stiffness adequate to ensure that it will not kink during lay-up or cure. The diameter should be small enough that the rod can follow contour and be processed similar to a large diameter fiber. It should be large enough to allow individual handling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the area of 
technology known generally as "composite materials", 
and in particular to methods and apparatus for 
producing composite materials and structures of 
increased strength. Composite materials consisting of fibers 
and a matrix of resin are used to produce a wide 
range of useful products, from fiberglass sail boats 
to the recent radar transparent, stealth aircraft. 
Structures of composite materials have numerous 
advantages that include the promise of higher 
strength and lower weight than those of other 
materials such as metal. The promise has not been 
fulfilled, however, because some composites 
materials, principally those using graphite fibers, 
have compressive strengths that are only a fraction 
of the tensile strength. Theoretically, composite 
materials of graphite fiber should have a compressive 
strength that equals the tensile strength. In 
practice the compressive strength is much less for 
reasons that have not been fully understood. It has been demonstrated that composite 
materials that include curved graphite fibers have a 
reduced fatigue resistance. It has been suggested 
that waviness of graphite fibers in a composite 
material can reduce compressive strength.  
 Generally, the commercially available 
composite materials that include graphite continue to 
be made with fibers that by reason of waviness, or 
some other reason, have decreased compressive 
strength. As a result, the promise of reducing 
weight by the use of composite materials has not been 
realized, with a consequent increase in cost and a 
decrease in performance in structures such as 
aircraft. However, US-A-4348347 discloses a composite material of 
carbon fibres in a matrix material wherein the waviness of the 
fibres is reduced by stretching to achieve a higher compressive 
strength. According to the present invention there is provided a 
composite material (45) of carbon fibers (37) and matrix of 
increased compressive strength, characterized in that: 
   a plurality of carbon fibers aligned linearly to a degree 
of waviness having an amplitude to length (A/L) ratio of less 
than about 0.9 percent and increased compressive strength; 
a matrix material formed around the fibers and solidified to maintain 
the fiber alignment and to prevent an increase in the degree of 
waviness in a rigid composite material during subsequent processing 
steps, the matrix consisting of about 10 to 50% by volume of the 
composite material; 
   the resulting composite material of carbon and
