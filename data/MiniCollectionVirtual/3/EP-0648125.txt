<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENT This Invention relates to antl-Inflammatory agents. Inflammation Is associated with a wide range of disorders resulting from both external and internal factors. For example, skin inflammation occurs in many conditions as a result of disease or injury. Other disorders result in internal inflammation, for example in joints affected by arthritis and in intestinal Inflammatory conditions such as colitis. Inflammation is also postulated as participatory in atherosclerosis, diabetes and other endocrine disorders.One serious disorder which gives rise to secondary disabilities which are associated with secondary inflammation is haemophilia. Two types of haemophilia are recognised, both being X-linked, recessive bleeding disorders with indistinguishable clinical manifestations. The more common type, haemophilia A, is attributable to decreased blood levels of properly functioning clotting factor VIII, whilst in haemophilia B, the defect is a decreased level of functional blood clotting factor IX. Haemophilia patients commonly suffer from progressive arthritis and musculoskeletal disability as a consequence of bleeding into joints and muscles. Much effort is put into management routines for haemophilia by lifestyle adjustments to protect affected joints. In the acute phase of a joint bleeding episode, which is the primary manifestation of the disorder, management comprises intravenous administration of Factor VIII concentrate, together with rest and simple or sometimes opiate analgesia. Simple analgesics are used in the subacute arthropathy that may persist following an acute bleeding episode. Non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs are only seldom used, and then only for pain control in the chronic arthropathy - when advanced joint damage has occurred. They are not generally used in the acute and subacute stages. 

 It is against this background that it has surprisingly been found that factor VIII has an anti-inflammatory utility independent of its recognised blood clotting function.Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of factor VIII in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition intended for introduction to the non-haemophiliac human body for the alleviation of inflammation.While it is recognised that in some circumstances it may be necessary to introduce the factor VIII by intravenous injection, it has further been found that local administration of factorVIII, for example by a topical or intradermal route, is also effective in alleviating inflammation.Therefore,

 CLAIMS
1. The use of Factor VIII in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition intended for introduction to the non-haemophiliac human body for the alleviation of inflammation. 2. A pharmaceutical composition, for use in local administration for the alleviation of inflammation, comprising factor VIII and a suitable carrier therefor.
3. A composition according to claim 2 for use in intradermal administration. 4. A composition according to claim 2 for use in topical administration.
5. A composition according to any one of claims 2 to 4 wherein the carrier comprises saline and optionally one or more bulking agents and/or stabilizers. 6. A composition according to claim 4 wherein the carrier comprises a percutaneous penetration enhancer.
7. A composition according to any one of claims 2 to 6 in unit dosage form, each dosage comprising from 1 to 4000 international units of factor VIII.
