<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automotive vehicle seat 
systems and, more particularly, to lightweight, high strength, 
economical seat track assemblies usable in such systems. Automotive seating systems usually comprise a pair 
of seat track assemblies each including a lower track member 
mounted to the floor of the vehicle and an upper track member 
carrying a seat and slideably engaged with the lower track 
member for adjusting the position of the seat in the vehicle. 
The upper track members are coupled so as to move 
simultaneously one with the other. The system is also 
associated with seat or safety belt means designed to restrain 
a seat occupant in the event of a vehicle impact. Automotive seating systems are considered part of 
the vehicle occupant's protection or safety systems. 
Accordingly, various requirements are imposed on such seating 
systems. They must have high strength and structural 
integrity so that the seat remains anchored to the vehicle in 
the event of a crash, i.e., the seat tracks should not 
separate from the vehicle, from each other or from the seat. 
Test requirements embodied in U.S. Federal Vehicle Safety 
Standards 208 and 210 require that the seating systems 
withstand loads of 1500 to 3000 pounds 
(ie 680 to 1360 kg) 
without failure. The 
outboard (adjacent the door) lower part of the seating system 
and each seat belt should withstand a load of 1500 pounds (680 kg) and 
the inboard (adjacent the centerline) lower part should 
withstand 3000 pounds (1360 kg). In addition, increased emphasis on 
fuel economy necessitates vehicle weight reduction. This, of 
course, makes it highly desirable to reduce the weight of the 
seating system, but mere weight reduction can adversely impact 
the strength the seating system. Cost containment is still another requirement 
imposed on automotive vehicle seating systems and prior art 
attempts to meet all three requirements, high-strength 
- lightweight - low cost, have not been satisfactory. Some 
attempts have been made to substitute aluminum for steel in  
 
the design of the seat track assemblies. These designs 
required steel reinforcements to provide the required 
structural strength and these reinforcements add weight and 
cost to the systems. Another desirable advantage for automotive seating 
systems is the integration of the seat or safety belt means 
so that the track assemblies, seat and seat belts are a 
self-contained unit. If the seat belts were integrated with 
the seat and track assemblies, adjustment of the seat by the
