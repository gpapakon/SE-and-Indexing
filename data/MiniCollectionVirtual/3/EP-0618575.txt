<ABSTRACT>
A write once type information recording medium 
having a recording format that includes sectors 

(500). Each sector includes x pieces of p-bit frames 
(510). Each frame contains an f-bit synchronization 

signal region (512) and a d-bit data region (514). 
Each bit of at least one x-bit packet (a, b, c, ..., 

n) in which a v-bit error correction code has been 
added to u-bit data, is distributed to each one of 

the data regions (514) of the x pieces of frames 
(510). This makes it possible for the write once 

type information recording medium to have an 
increased data storage efficiency and an effective 

error correction capability for a burst error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
write once type information recording medium such as
an optical memory card. More specifically, the
present invention is directed to a method and
apparatus which is capable of formatting a write once
type information recording medium with increasing
storage efficiency, and which has the capability of
correcting burst errors, to a write once type
information recording medium formatted in accordance
with the above-mentioned format, and to a method and
apparatus for writing data to or reading data from
such a write once type information recording medium.The need has been arisen to increase a data
recording density in view of an economical point when
data are recorded on an information recording medium.
However, when the data recording density is
increased, errors occurring in the reproduced data
can be increased because of, for instance, defects in
the recording medium.In general, to reduce errors in the reproduced
data, an error correction code is added to the data
during a data recording operation so as to perform
the error correction. There are typically two
different types of errors occurring in the reproduced 
data, namely, random errors occurring at random, and
burst errors occurring in a continuous manner. Once
a burst error occurs, it can hardly be corrected
owing to a large continuous errors included therein.To make error correction feasible, interleaving
is carried out in a conventional information
recording system. That is, a series of data is
subdivided into a large number of data segments which
will then be distributed into the recording medium.
In this case, even if positionally continuous errors
occur on the recording medium due to defects thereof,
the errors are not continued on the reproduced data.
As a result, these errors can be corrected as random
errors.Fig. 1 schematically represents an example of
the conventional interleaving technique. In
accordance with the conventional interleaving method,
272 "synchronization signals for a frame and bit"
(simply, referred to "synchronization signals") are
first arranged, each of which is composed of 8 bits,
for instance, and indicated by symbol "F" as
illustrated in Fig. 1. Subsequently, a 272-bit
packet "a", a 272-bit packet "b", a 272-bit packet
"c", ---, a 272-bit packet "n" are arranged in
parallel to each other, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
The first 272-bit packet "a" contains 190-bit data
consisting of a1, a2, ---, and a190, and an 82-bit
error correction code consisting of a191, a192, ---,
and
