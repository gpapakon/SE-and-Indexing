<ABSTRACT>
A method of transferring designs and patterns using an 
electrostatic recording paper. A desired pattern is printed, 

hand drawn or copied on the electrostatic recording paper, thus 
producing a transfer paper. The transfer paper is pasted on a 

surface of an object via an adhesive, and then the recording 
paper is wet by water or some other liquid and peeled off, thus 

leaving the pattern on the surface of the object. A synthetic 
resin protective film is applied on the surface of the pattern on 

the object. The objects which receive the transfer of the 
desired designs and patterns are made can be any including 

floors, walls, glass windows, ceilings, walls, fences, etc. of 
completed buildings and the inside and outside surfaces of 

elevators, vehicles, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
transferring designs and patterns onto the surfaces of various 
objects. There are several different ways in transferring 
patterns and designs (collectively called "patterns" below) onto 
surfaces of various objects. Since these transfer methods 
require predetermined continuous steps to finish, the methods are 
only suited for mass production which is done by manufacturers 
who own large scale printing machines. As a result, the transfer of patterns onto the 
floors, walls, glass windows, ceilings, walls, fences, etc. of 
completed buildings and on the inside and outside surfaces of 
elevators, vehicles, etc. is considered to be virtually 
impossible. In addition, it is currently extremely difficult 
to transfer or apply clean and bright patterns on curved surfaces 
or on the surfaces of objects which have a poor surface 
smoothness due to fine indentations and projections of 
approximately 1 to 5 mm.  Accordingly, the general aim of the present 
invention is to solve these problems. The primary aim of the present invention is to 
provide a novel transfer method which allows the simple transfer 
of designs and patterns including letters, numbers, symbols, etc. 
(called "pattern" or "patterns") to any desired surfaces, such as 
floors, walls, vehicles, elevators, ceilings, glass windows, 
wood, cloth, leather, paper, rubber, plastic, stone, ceramics, 
metals, concrete, asphalt roadways, etc. even if the surfaces are 
curved, uneven or have a poor surface smoothness. The invention solves the problem by the use of an 
electrostatic recording paper, and patterns to be transferred 
onto surfaces are executed on such a paper. A pattern is 
executed on the recording paper by various different ways 
including printing, color copying, hand drawing and other 
methods. The electrostatic paper with the pattern thereon is 
pasted on the surface of an object that receives the patterns. 
Then, the electrostatic paper is peeled off while being wet with 
a liquid such as water, a solvent, etc., leaving the pattern 
alone on the surface of the object. More specifically, according to the present invention, 
(1) a transfer paper is prepared by executing a desired pattern 
on an electrostatic recording paper by way of printing, hand 
drawing, color copying, etc., and (2) the thus obtained transfer 
paper with a pattern layer thereon is affixed via a tackifier or 
adhesive agent on the surface of an object upon which the pattern  
 
is to be transferred, and then (3) the

<CLAIMS>
A method for transferring a pattern characterized in 
that (a) a transfer paper is obtained by executing a desired 

pattern on an electrostatic recording paper by means of printing, 
hand drawing or color copying, etc.; (b) a pattern surface of 

said transfer paper is pasted to a surface of an object, which 
acts as a transfer-receiving material, via a tackifier or 

adhesive agent, (c) said electrostatic recording paper is then 
wet by water or some other liquid and is peeled away so that only 

a pattern layer is transferred to said object, and (d) a surface 
of a thus transferred pattern layer is coated with a synthetic 

resin so that a protective film is formed. 
A method for transferring a pattern according to 
Claim 1, wherein a pattern is executed after said electrostatic 

recording paper has been coated with one selected from the group 
consisting of a transparent binder, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, 

and calcium carbonate. 
A method for transferring a pattern onto a surface 
of an object comprising the steps of: 

   executing a desired pattern on an electrostatic 
recording paper, thus obtaining a transfer paper; 

   affixing said transfer paper to a surface of an 
object via an adhesive; 

   wetting said transfer paper; 
   peeling off of said transfer paper from said 

surface of said object, thus leaving said desired pattern on said 
surface; and

 
   applying a synthetic resin on said pattern so as 

to form a protective film. 
A method for transferring a pattern according to 
Claim 3, wherein said execution of said desired pattern to said 

electrostatic recording paper is performed by one selected from 
the group consisting of printing, hand drawing, and copying. 
A method for transferring a pattern onto a surface 
of an object comprising the steps of: 

   affixing a transfer paper, which is obtained by 
executing a pattern on a surface of an electrostatic recording 

paper, to a surface of an object via an adhesive; 
   wetting said transfer paper; 

   peeling off of said transfer paper from said 
surface of said object, thus leaving said pattern on said 

surface; and 
   applying a synthetic resin on said pattern on said 

surface so as to form a protective film on said pattern. 
A method for transferring a pattern according to 
Claim 5, wherein said execution of said pattern to said 

electrostatic recording paper is performed by one method selected 
from the group consisting of printing, hand drawing and copying.
