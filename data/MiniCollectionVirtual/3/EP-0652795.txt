<ABSTRACT>
A tennis racquet has a standard overall length and strung surface width. The length of the strung surface is elongated to 14.5 inches or more, e.g., 14.9 inches, and formed as an egg shape to produce improved stability while retaining good power. In a preferred embodiment, the ends of the main and cross strings engage the frame in a staggered configuration such that the strings engage the outermost crossing string on the surface facing one side of the center stringing plane and engage the frame on opposite side of the central stringing plane.

 DESCRIPTIONLONG STRING TENNIS RACQUETFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to an improvement in oversized tennis racquets.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONHoward Head U.S. patent No. 3,999,756 discloses a tennis racquet having a strung surface with a length between 12 and 15 inches, a maximum width in the range of 9 to 11*. inches, and a strung surface area between 85 and 130 square inches. Racquets made in accordance with the principles of the Howard Head invention have a larger sweet spot, and exhibit better power and performance, than prior racquets, and accordingly most tennis racquets made today are made according to the Howard Head invention.While most tennis racquets have a conventional overall length of about 27 inches, racquets are made in varying head sizes. Two of the more common head sizes are, respectively, the so-called "mid-size" racquet, with a head strung surface size of about 90-95 square inches, and the "oversize" racquet, with a head size of about 110 square inches, although these can vary.While the Howard Head patent discloses head sizes larger than 110 square inches, as a practical matter racquets with a strung surface area much above 110 square inches are not popular. This is due to the fact that, aside from the weight penalty, the racquet becomes unwieldy if the frame is made too large, particularly if the width increases excessively.Another problem with increasing the head size is that, as the length of the strung surface increases, vibration tends to increase in the main strings. This 

vibration can be annoying to players and thus is undesirable.In recent years, the power of tennis racquets has increased, resulting in higher ball speeds and the need for quicker reactions. Shot making involves more short quick swings, or "whacking" the ball, rather than long smooth swings. For quicker reaction, it would thus be desirable to use a racquet which is relatively light weight, particularly in the head. However, if a head light, lightweight racquet were to be used, the racquet would tend to jump back upon impact with the ball. Not only would this impart undesirable shock to the arm tendons, but the racquet would not be stable.Recently, tennis racquets have been introduced which are lighter in weight. Such weight savings have been achieved, for example, by using lighter weight handles, such as molded-in handles. Such racquets are designed to be head heavy, however, to avoid the problems mentioned above. However, a head heavy racquet tends to be less maneuverable, and thus less

We claim:
1. In a tennis racquet comprising a frame and a handle; said racquet having a standard overall length; said frame including a head portion, a pair of converging frame portions extending from said head portion and forming a throat region, a shaft extending from said converging frame portions and supporting said handle, and a bridge piece arranged between said converging frame portions to define, with said head, a stringing area; wherein said stringing area has a conventional maximum width of less than about 10.75 inches; wherein said head portion and throat piece include holes for receiving strings; said racquet further comprising a plurality of interwoven main and cross strings forming a strung surface, said main strings and cross strings each including a pair of strings located outermost from the geometric center of the strung surface at opposed locations, each outer-most string having opposed surfaces facing opposite sides of the central stringing plane; the improvement wherein said stringing area is generally egg- shaped has a strung surface length of at least 14% inches, and wherein successive ends of at least some of said main and cross strings are staggered such that the associated strings cross their respective outer-most crossing string on one surface, facing one side of the central stringing plane, and engage the frame on the opposite side of the central string plane.
2. A tennis racquet according to claim 1, wherein said head includes opposed side portions, a tip portion, a pair of upper corners separating said side portions from said tip portion; and a pair of lower corners separating said side portions from said bridge piece; wherein said strings have a constant stagger at least in said side portions and tip portion. 


 3. A tennis racquet according to claim 2, wherein said strings, in said corners and bridge piece, have a stagger which is less than said constant stagger.
4. A tennis racquet according to claim 2, wherein said stringing area is at least about 15 inches in length.
5. A tennis racquet according to claim 4, wherein said stringing area length is less than about 15% inches.
6. A tennis racquet according to claim 2, wherein said strung surface area is greater than 110 square inches.
7. A tennis racquet according to claim 2, wherein said strung surface area is about 116 square inches.
8. In a tennis racquet comprising a frame and a handle; said racquet having a standard overall length; said frame including a head portion, a pair of converging frame portions extending from said head portion and forming a throat region, a shaft extending from said converging frame portions and supporting said handle, and a bridge piece arranged between said converging frame portions to define, with said head, a stringing area; wherein said stringing area has a conventional maximum width of less than about 10.75 inches; said racquet further comprising a plurality of interwoven main and cross strings forming a strung surface; the improvement wherein said stringing area is egg-shaped.
9. A racquet according to claim 8, wherein the racquet has a strung surface length of at least 14% inches and a stringing area greater than 110 square inches.
10. A tennis racquet comprising a frame and a handle; said racquet having a standard overall length of about 27 inches; said frame including a head portion defining a stringing area and a shaft supporting said handle, and a plurality of interwoven strings; wherein 


said stringing area has a conventional maximum width of about 9 to 10.75 inches; wherein said racquet has a polar moment of inertia less than 1.9 gram-m

; a balance point greater than 13.4 inches away from the butt end of the frame; a maximum weight of 300 grams; a strung surface length of at least 14% inches; and a minimum free space frequency of 100 Hz, wherein such racquet is lightweight, maneuverable, and stable.
11. A tennis racquet according to claim 10, wherein said frame is formed of a composite material and has a free space frequency of at least 140 Hz.
