<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polypeptides and their use in the diagnosis and therapy of disorders involving complement activity and various inflammatory and immune disorders.Constituting about 10% of the globulins in normal serum, the complement system is composed of many different proteins that are important in the immune system's response to foreign antigens. The complement system becomes activated when its primary components are cleaved and the products alone or with other proteins, activate additional complement proteins resulting in a proteolytic cascade. Activation of the complement system leads to a variety of responses including increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis of phagocytic cells, activation of inflammatory cells, opsonization of foreign particles, direct killing of cells and tissue damage. Activation of the complement system may be triggered by antigen-antibody complexes (the classical pathway) or, for example, by lipopolysaccharides present in cell walls of pathogenic bacteria (the alternative pathway).Complement activation (CA) is known to occur in a wide variety of acute inflammatory processes particularly those associated with ischaemia and reperfusion injury (Rossen et al., 1985 Circ. Res., 57, 119,; Morgan B.P., 1990 The biological effects of complement activation. In 'Complement, Clinical Aspects and Relevance to Disease'. Academic Press. London.)It is generally accepted that at least some of the components of the classical complement cascade can be detected by immunohistochemical methods in close association with senile plaques in AD brain (Eikelenboom et al.. 1994, Neuroscience, 59, 561-568). There is good evidence for the involvement of C1. C3 and C4, but evidence for the presence of the C5-C9 membrane-attack complex (MAC) is not yet evident (Veerhuis et al. 1995, Vichows Arch. 426, 603-610). Cells of the CNS have been shown to synthesise complement components (for review see Barnum, 1995 Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med 6, 132-146), and production of C3 is enhanced in response to incubation with bA4 peptide (Haga et al., 1993 Brain Res., 601, 88-94). Thus complement can be induced locally in the brain itself and is not necessarily derived solely from the plasma compartment.Of particular interest is the fact that the bA4 peptide has been found to bind directly to the initial component of the complement cascade (Clq) and to initiate the whole of the classical complement system in vitro (including MAC) by an antibody-independent mechanism (Rogers et al., 1992, Proc. Nat. Acad.
