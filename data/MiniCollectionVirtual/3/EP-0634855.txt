<ABSTRACT>
A direct conversion Binary FSK radio receiver has an AFC loop comprising an 
Exclusive-Or phase detector 104 responsive to the I₃ and Q₃ signals. I and Q filters 100, 

101 are not identical but have different frequency-phase characteristics such that their phase 
shifts are identical when the local oscillator 102 is correctly tuned and differ when the local 

oscillator is off-tune. Detector 104 detects the change of phase and applies a control signal 
to local oscillator 102 such as to return the local oscillator frequency to the correct value. 
Alternatively, identical filters may be used in the I and Q channels, circuits having 
different phase shifts being coupled between the I₃ and Q₃ signals and the inputs of the 

phase detector 104.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detectors. More particularly, but not exclusively, this
invention relates to direct conversion Quadrature Detectors for use in demodulating FSK
modulated radio signals, and to radio receivers incorporating such detectors.In a conventional zero IF FSK Receiver, shown in Figure 1, an incoming radio
signal on Node 1 is applied to two channels, an in-phase channel I, and a Quadrature-phase
channel Q. Both channels are substantially identical and comprise a respective mixer 2, 3,
a channel filter 4, 5, and a limiting amplifier 6, 7. A local oscillator 8 is applied directly to
the in-phase mixer 2 and via 90° phase shift circuit 9 to the Quadrature-Phase mixer 3. The
limiting amplifiers 6, 7 remove the amplitude information from the signals and produce
digital output signals containing only phase information. These signals are applied to a
detector 10. The output of detector 10 is passed through limiting amplifier 11 to produce a
detected base-band signal at its output 12. If necessary, amplifier 11 may incorporate a
post-detection filter, not shown. Channel filters 4 and 5 serve to reject unwanted spurious
signals from the output 5 of the mixers, and both I and Q channels are ideally identical so
as to avoid any additional phase shift. The two signals applied to the inputs of detector 10
therefore always lead or lag each other by 90°.Such prior art circuits have proved satisfactory, but require the use of a highly
stable local oscillator LO locked to the carrier frequency of the signal to be received. In
practice this means the use of a high quality and relatively expensive crystal oscillator.
Such a crystal oscillator can represent a significant part of the expense of a receiver,
especially in applications such as paging systems.One way of avoiding the requirement to use a highly stable crystal is to use an AFC
(Automatic Frequency Control) loop which locks itself to the carrier of the received signal.
The absence of an intermediate frequency signal in direct conversion receivers poses
difficulties in the use of an AFC loop for frequency control. The present invention arose
from an attempt to provide an improved receiver. Receivers having filters giving different responses in I and Q channels are disclosed
in US 4,336,616 and in corresponding 2301 NTIS Tech Notes (1985) Nov., No. 11, Part B,
Springfield, Virginia, USA. The effects of non-symmetry in a Costas loop is discussed in
"Tracking Loop Bias due to Costas Loop Arm Filter Imbalance", IEEE Transactions on
Communications, Vol.
