<DESCRIPTION>
 PEROXY BLEACHING COMPOSITION STABILIZED WITH ETHYLENEDIAMINE-N, N-DISUCCINIC ACIDThis invention relates to a bleaching composition comprising an active oxygen- releasing (peroxy) compound and a zero-phosphorus containing stabilizing agent, wherein the stabilizing agents permits a controlled bleaching action when the composition is used as an aqueous solution in a bleaching process. The stabilizing agent also provides for good storage stability of the product. The bleaching composition is also useful as a component of a detergent composition.The use of peroxy compounds for bleaching purposes is well known in the art. By peroxy compound it is meant hydrogen peroxide or any of its addition compounds including inorganic perhydrate salts, such as perborates and percarbonates, or organic peroxyacids. Perborate salts are well known as components of detergent compositions for use in, for example, laundry and automatic dishwashing. Hydrogen peroxide is commonly used as a bleaching agent in, for example, textile and paper pulp bleaching processes.In a process involving bleaching it is desirable that the bleach is released in a controlled manner throughout the process. The use of a stabilizing agent to minimize the rapid decomposition of the peroxy compound is well established in the peroxy bleaching art, because, among other things, the oxygen released by such rapid decomposition of the peroxy compound in general has no bleaching action as contrasted with the normal autodecomposition of the peroxy compound which does result in a bleaching action. In fact, the rapid 

decomposition of the peroxy compound may be harmful. For example, cellulosic materials in strongly alkaline peroxy solutions are attacked by the oxygen from the rapid decomposition with the result of loss of strength by the materials. For today's laundering and dishwashing conditions the stabilizing agent should preferably be effective in alkaline solutions and under the relatively high temperature conditions which may be encountered in practice. The stabilizing agent should also be compatible with other components, which may be present in the detergent or peroxy bleaching solutions.It is well known that the presence of certain heavy metal ions may catalyse peroxy bleach decomposition. Such heavy metal ions are inevitably present in the wash liquors of laundry and dishwashing processes, being components of many food and/or body soils. Heavy metal ions are also commonly present components of the liquors of wood pulp bleaching processes, the wood pulp
