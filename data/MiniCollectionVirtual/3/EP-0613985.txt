<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the production of construction elements consisting of wooden beams or members constituting a framework over which a sheet of concrete is cast. These elements are used for the construction of wood-concrete composite floors or panels. The invention relates more particularly to the bonding between the wooden beams or members and the slab or sheet of concrete. This bonding is formed by at least one sheet-metal strip (4) comprising, on one edge, crampons in the form of crenellations (5) equipped with teeth (6), on the other edge, folded-over parts (9) forming a flanged edge, on the side wall of the metal sheet, embossing (7) forming projections and cut-outs (8) forming flaring which emerges on the edge on which the flanged edge (9) is produced. The crenellations (5) equipped with teeth (6) are enclosed in the beam (1), the flaring (8) allows the metal reinforcements (3) to pass and be held in place, the flanged edges (9), the embossing (7) and the flaring (8) participate in the anchoring of the metal sheet (4) in the concrete slab (2).

Composite wood-concrete construction member having in 
combination beams or girders (1) made from wood, in solid, 

glued laminated, agglomerated fibre or particle form constituting 
the framework on which is moulded a concrete plate (2), 

metal fittings (3) embedded in said concrete plate, connecting 
means between the beams (1), the concrete plate (2) and the 

metal fittings (3), characterized in that the connecting means 
are constituted by at least one sheet metal strip (4) having 

on one edge clips (5-6) permitting the fixing of said sheet 
metal strip (4) in each of the beams (1) and on the flank and/or 

the other edge means ensuring the joining of the sheet metal 
strip (4) to the concrete plate (2) and the metal fittings 

(3). 
Building member according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the clips (5-6) permitting the fixing of the sheet metal 

strip (4) in each of the beams (1) are produced on the edges 
of the sheet in the form of indentations (5), whose ends are 

provided with teeth (6). 
Building member according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the means ensuring the joining of the sheet metal strip 

(4) to the concrete slab (2) and the metal fittings (3) are 
constituted by stamped portions (7) and/or cut portions (8) 

produced on the flank of the sheet and/or issuing onto the 
edge opposite to that having the clips (5-6). 
Building member according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the stamped portions (7) produced on the flank of the 

sheet are impressions forming projections stamped on one of 
the sides of the flank of the metal sheet.  

 
Construction member according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the stamped portions (7) and cut portions (S) produced 

on the flank of the sheet and issuing onto the edge opposite 
to that having the clips (5-6) are enlargements permitting 

the passage and holding of the metal fittings (3). 
Building member according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the means ensuring the joining of the sheet metal strip 

(4) to the concrete plate (2) are constituted by bent portions 
(9) forming a flanged edge on the edge opposite to that having 

the clips (5-6). 
Building member according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the joining means constituted by at least one sheet metal 

strip (4) fixed in each of the beams (1) and ensuring its joining 
to the concrete plate (2) and/or the metal fittings (3) 

is a wavy sheet metal strip (4). 
Building member according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the joining means constituted by at least one sheet metal 

strip (4) are parallel sheet metal strips fixed in each of 
the beams (1) and ensuring the joining thereof to the concrete 

slab (2) and/or the metal fittings (3). 
Use of the building member according to one of the preceding 

claims for producing composite wood-concrete floors. 
Use of the building member according to one of the claims 
1 to 8 for producing composite wood-concrete panels.
