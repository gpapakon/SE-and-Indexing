<ABSTRACT>
A transparency organizer and storage tray (10) adapted to act as a sheet (T) holding, transferring, and repository means for managing the flow control of a plurality of transparency film sheets (T), each generally impressed with indicia creating a discernible image when viewed, characterized by a transparency film sheet carrying region (13) including a first transparency film sheet source holding region (14) adapted to house a plurality of sheets (T) which are to be projected, a second sub-adjacent transparency film sheet storage region (15) adapted to house a plurality of said sheets (T) after projection and, means (M, 24, 31) for holding the transparency film sheet carrying region (13), at an elevation so that the bottom (19) of the second transparency film sheet storage region (15) is at an elevation co-incident with a platen element, actual or imaginary (11, PP) of a transparency projector (P) so that light passes through that transparency sheet (T) for viewing.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TRANSPARENCY ORGANIZER AND STORAGE TRAYThis invention relates to transparency organzier and storage tray which is particularly suitable to store transparencies in a convenient and sequential order and, to be used as a retrofit over an overhead transparency film sheet projector allowing the user to simply slide the transparency from the tray onto the projecting surface from which the transparency is viewed, and thereafter, to slide the transparency back into the same storage tray for storage.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONFor overhead transparency film sheet projection, one uses an overhead projector which generally has an upper flat glass plate, acting as a translucent platen sized a little larger than 8 by 11 inches, onto which is placed a transparency film sheet which is to be projected by the projector onto a screen overhead. From the underside of the glass platen, is a source of light which passes through the platen, and the transparency film sheet, to reflect off an inclined mirror projecting the light with its latent transparency image onto a screen for view by an assembly of people in a room such as a conference room, meeting room, classroom, and the like.The organization of transparency film sheets for such presentation has been haphazard at best and normally requires a second table adjacent to that of the projector onto which the transparency film sheets are stacked prior to display, requiring individual, sequential transport onto the glass platen, anad then removal onto a collection stack, normally also located on the second table. In that respect, the transparency film sheet to be projected is first removed from the source pile and placed on the glass platen, and then after viewing, is removed from the glass platen to be put onto a collection completionSUBSTITUTESHEET 

pile adjacent to the source transparency pile.THE INVENTIONWe have conceived of a simple device which has two juxtaposed internal transparency,, film sheet holding regions, and a movable translucent sub-platen which may be moved into a closing position, to close and overcover each region and thereby constrain any transparencies that are within either region therein; while adapted to be moved into an open operative position exposing one margin of each holding region adjacent to the sub-platen. When in the open operative position, the translucent sub-platen is adapted to overcover the platen of the overhead projector and to permit the simple movement of a transparency film sheet from the uppermost holding tray or transparency film

WE CLAIM :
1. A transparency organizer and storage tray (10) adapted to act as a sheet (T) holding, transferring, and repository means for managing the flow control of a plurality of transparency film sheets (T) , each generally impressed with indicia creating a discernible image when viewed, characterized by:
(a) a transparency film sheet carrying region (13) including,
(i) a first transparency film sheet source holding region (14) adapted to house a plurality of sheets (T) which are to be projected,
(ii) a second transparency film sheet storage region (15) adapted to house a plurality of said sheets (T) after projection; and,
(b) means (M, 24, 31) for holding the transparency film sheet carrying region (13), at an elevation so that the bottom (19) of the second transparency film sheet storage region (15) is at an elevation co-incident with a platen element, actual or imaginary, (11,PP) of a transparency projector (P) so that light passes through that transparency sheet (T) for viewing.
2. The tray (10) as claimed in claim 1, additionally characterized by the first transparency film sheet holding region (14) being super-adjacent to that of the second transparency film sheet storage region (15) .
3. The tray (10) as claimed in claim 2, additionally characterized in that the second transparency film sheet storage region (15) has a biasing means (19S, 19F, 37) subdividing said region (15) into a super-adjacent second region (15U) and a sub-adjacent second region (15L).
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


4. The tray (10) as claimed in claim 3, additionally characterized by the biasing means (19S), (19F) and (37), includes a flexible sheet (19).
5. The tray (10) as claimed in c aim 3, wherein said flexible sheet is a single cardboard sheet (19), with a forward bend (19F), and a forward seam (19S).
6. The tray (10) as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, including a cover (C), an anchoring means (47) carried by the tray (10) characterized in that one end of the cover (C) is articulatingly attached through a flexible hinge (12) to the margin of the second transparency film storage region (15L), the cover (C) including a plurality of articulating elements and surfaces (12, 30 through 45), at least one of which (30, 39) is adapted to carry means (50,55) for removable attachment of the tray (10) to a transparency projector (P) , one panel (45) of the cover (C) carrying means (46) for removable attachment to the anchoring means (47) whereby the cover (C) , in its closed position, overcovers and secures closed, the regions (14, 15); and, in an operative position exposes proximate margins of said regions (14, 15) at an operative elevation intersecting the prolongation of the axial plane of the platen (11, PP) whereby to permit slide transport of the transparency (T) into and out of the tray (10) out from the upper region (14), onto the platen (11, PP) , thence, into the lower storage region (15, 15U) in the identical sequential order as when located in the upper region (14).
7. The tray (10) as claimed in the aforesaid claims and as disclosed in the description and shown in the drawings herein.
