<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shaped ceramic-ceramic 
composite article comprising a ceramic 
monolith, ceramic fibers, a first coating of a 
carbonaceous matrix, and a second coating of silicon 
carbide. Ceramic-ceramic composites are particularly 
useful in high temperature, chemically corrosive 
environments. This is because such composites are able 
to withstand chemical corrosion better than comparable 
metal parts, and because they are better able to 
withstand thermal and mechanical shock than monolithic 
ceramic parts. Ceramic-ceramic composites are described in 
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,275,095 and 4,397,901, which describe 
the method of making a composite article with a carbon 
fibrous substrate, a pyrolytic carbon sheath, and a 
compliant coating of metallic carbide, oxide, or 
nitride over the coated fibers. The fibers are taught 
to be cellulose, pitch, rayon, polyacrylonitrile, or 
wool. U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,013 describes a fibrous 
substrate with a pyrolytic carbon coating deposited 
around each fiber, and a metal carbide, boride, oxide, 
or nitride coating over each fiber. The fibers are 
taught to be carbonaceous or ceramic. U.S. Pat. No. 4,863,798 discloses multiple 
layers of coatings on a carbon or ceramic base. A 
substrate of chopped fibers, felt, cloth or granular 
material (graphite or silicon carbide) is mixed with a 
carbonaceous binder and coated with a pyrolytic carbon 
layer. A barrier layer of boron nitride or boron 
carbide is then applied and silicon carbide is coated  
 
over that. A commercially available ceramic composite is 
marketed under the trade designation "SICONEX" by the 
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. (3M) of St. 
Paul, MN. Such composites are ceramic-ceramic 
composites comprised of aluminoborosilicate ceramic 
fibers, a carbonaceous layer, and a silicon carbide 
overlayer. Such composites are prepared by braiding, 
weaving, or filament winding aluminoborosilicate 
ceramic fibers in a desired shape, or alternatively, 
fashioning aluminoborosilicate ceramic cloth into such 
a shape. The ceramic fiber shape is then treated with 
a phenolic resin which is cured, producing a rigidified 
article. The thus rigidified article is heated in an 
evacuated chamber such that the cured phenolic resin is 
carbonized. The article is then coated with silicon 
carbide via chemical vapor deposition at temperatures 
ranging from about 900 to about 1200Â°C to provide a 
semi-permeable, chemically resistant coating of silicon 
carbide. The resultant rigid ceramic composite is 
useful
