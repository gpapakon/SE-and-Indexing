<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a seal (2) for the end of a shaft (7) extending out of the end wall (62) of a housing (6) and for the end wall (62) is distinguished in that a seal holder (20) is produced as a light metal diecasting (20), that a sheet-metal ring (4) with a shaft sealing ring (1) moulded onto it is pressed radially and axially from a side of the seal holder (20) towards which a clearance (201) in the diecasting is open, under plastic deformation of the seal holder, in such a way that the seal holder is plastically deformed and the radial inner dimension of the sealing edge (103) of the shaft sealing ring (1) is set within the required close tolerance limits, and that the at least partially radially running outer section (42) of the sheet-metal ring (4) is encapsulated on both sides in a second elastomer material via a connecting channel (23) in the diecasting (20) to form an end-wall receiving groove (21) for the static seal (3) during moulding of the latter onto the seal holder.

Method for the manufacture of a seal (2) for the end of a shaft 
(7) passing out of the end wall (62) of a casing (6), as well 

as for the end wall (62), with a gasket receptacle (20), constructed 
as a casting and having a casing side (26), a passage 

opening (21) for the shaft (7), a shaft seal ring (1) located 
in the passage opening and made from a first elastomer material 

and a static gasket (3) located on the casing side (26) made 
from a second elastomer material for sealing with respect to 

the end wall (62) of the casing (6), the shaft seal ring (1) 
being vulcanized onto an inner radial portion (41) of a sheet 

metal ring (4) for the formation of a shaft seal ring unit 
and an outer portion (42) of the sheet metal ring engages on 

a collar (28) in a recess (201) of the gasket receptacle (20) 
and is fastened by second elastomer material to both sides 

of the gasket receptacle, said material being linked to the 
static gasket (3), characterized in that the gasket receptacle 

(20) is produced as a light metal pressure die casting, that 
the sheet metal ring (4) is so radially and axially pressed 

in from one side of the gasket receptacle (20) towards which 
the recess (201) is open and accompanied by plastic deformation 

of the gasket receptacle, that the at least partially radially 
directed, outer portion (42,43) of the sheet metal ring is 

injected round on either side with the second elastomer material 
by means of a connecting channel (23) in the gasket receptacle 

(20) to an end wall-side reception groove (21) for the static 
gasket (3) during its moulding to the gasket receptacle. 
Seal for the end of a shaft (7) passing out of the end wall 
(62) of a casing (6), as well as for the end wall (62), with 

a gasket receptacle (20), constructed as a casting and having 
a casing side (26), a passage opening (21) for the shaft (7), 

a shaft seal ring (1) located in the passage opening and made  
 

from a first elastomer material and a static gasket (3) located 
on the casing side (26) made from a second elastomer material 

for sealing with respect to the end wall (62) of the casing 
(6), the shaft seal ring (1) being vulcanized onto an inner 

radial portion (41) of a sheet metal ring (4) for the formation 
of a shaft seal ring unit and an outer portion (42) of the 

sheet metal ring engages on a collar (28) in a recess (201) 
of the gasket receptacle (20) and is fastened by second elastomer 

material to both sides of the gasket receptacle, said material 
being linked to the static gasket (3), characterized in 

that the gasket receptacle is constructed as a light metal 
pressure die casting (20), that the recess (201) is open towards 

the casing side (26) of the gasket receptacle and the shaft 
seal ring unit (1,4) is pressed from the casing side (26) against 

the collar (28) under radial and axial deformation of the 
pressure die casting (20) in the recess (201) and that the 

outer portion (42,43) of the sheet metal ring (4) is at least 
partly radially directed and on either side is bordered by 

rings (30,31,32) having the same external diameter and made 
from a second elastomer material and connected by means of 

at least one common connecting channel (23) to a groove (21) 
on the casing side (26) for receiving the static gasket (3). 
Seal according to claim 2, characterized in that the outer 
portion (42) of the sheet metal ring (4) is directed radially 

and that the ring (31) of elastomer material on the side of 
the sheet metal ring (4) remote from the casing (6) is received 

in a circular groove (29) undercutting the collar (28). 
Seal according to claim 2, characterized in that the outer 
portion (43) of the sheet metal ring is bent away from the 

collar (28), so that a circular groove is formed between the 
collar (28) and the back of the outer portion (43) for shaping 

a ring (32) from second elastomer material.
