<ABSTRACT>
The burner control unit (A) besides two current supply inputs (E1,E0), has at least one additional intrinsically safe activating input (Ea), and can only be switched-on with the presence of an activating signal (Us). The relay (RY) is a bistable relay connected at the output of a control transistor (Q1), the contact (ry) of which breaks the current supply to the burner control unit, with a responding relay. A DC rectifier circuit (D1,C2) is connected to the relay (RY), for producing the activating signal (Us). The control electrode (BQ) of the control transistor is connected to the output of an oscillator (Os). The overtemp. switch (HL) is connected in the oscillator circuit in such a way, that with the response of the over temp. switch, the oscillator oscillations break off. The control transistor is brought to a continuous current conducting condition and the relay to a response condition.
