<ABSTRACT>
A lubricant comprising an ester compound prepared from a hydroxyl-terminated perfluorinated polyether and a 
long-chain carboxylic acid or a fluoroalkylated carboxylic acid, or from a carboxyl-terminated perfluorinated polyether 

and a long-chain alcohol or a fluoroalkylated alcohol; and a magnetic recording medium containing the same. The 
lubricant has a good lubricity not only even under severe conditions including both a low temperature and humidity and 

high temperature and humidity but also for a long period of time. Accordingly, when used as a lubricant for a magnetic 
recording medium, it can lower the coefficient of friction and remarkably improve the travelling characteristics, wear 

resistance and durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lubricant in a magnetic 
recording medium such as a magnetic tape or a magnetic disk, 
etc., and a magnetic recording medium using the same. In so called metal magnetic thin film type magnetic 
recording media such that, e.g., a ferromagnetic metal material 
is deposited on the surface of a non-magnetic support by the 
technique such as vapor deposition, etc. so that a magnetic layer 
is formed, since the smoothness of the magnetic layer surface is 
extremely satisfactory, the substantial contact area with respect 
to a slide member such as a magnetic head or a guide roller, etc. 
is large. Accordingly, the friction factor becomes large, so 
there are many problems that adhesion (so called sticking) is apt 
to occur, resulting in lackness in running characteristic or 
durability. In order to improve these problems, it have been studied to 
use various lubricants. Hitherto, an attempt has been made to 
top-coat higher fatty acid and its ester, etc. on the magnetic 
layer of the magnetic recording medium to thereby hold down the  
 
friction factor to a lower value. Meanwhile, for lubricants used in the magnetic recording 
medium, very severe characteristics are required from a viewpoint 
of the property. It is the present circumstances that lubricants 
conventionally used are difficult to cope with such requirement. Namely, for lubricants used in the magnetic recording 
medium, it is required that 
(1) the low temperature characteristic is excellent so that 
a predetermined lubricating effect is ensured in use at cold 
districts, (2) since the spacing between the lubricant and the 
magnetic head becomes problem, the lubricant can be coated in an 
extremely thin manner, and a sufficient lubricating 
characteristic is exhibited even in that case, (3) the lubricant tolerate long time, or use for a long 
time so that the lubricating effect is maintained, and the like. However, higher fatty acid or its ester, etc. conventionally 
used has a tendency such that it might be frozen and solidified 
under low temperature condition like less than 0°C so that the 
function as the lubricant is damaged or there results 
insufficient durability of long time. Further, there has been 
proposed a method in which perfluoropolyether is used as a 
lubricant. However, since perfluoropolyether cannot be dissolved 
only in freon solvent, it cannot be said that such material is 
necessarily preferable material from a viewpoint of the  
 
environmental problem. As stated above, in the field of the
