<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a speech decoding method and a speech decoder. The speech decoder receives information frames containing speech encoding parameters. The first bits in each frame form a synchronization word, and a synchronization check bit is thereafter repeated at regular intervals within the frame. A synchronization unit (41) synchronizes the speech decoder with the information frames received and extracts the speech encoding parameters, which are stored in buffer memories (43-47) until the reception of the following information frame. The synchronization unit (41) monitors the synchronization check bits in order to detect errors within the information frame, and upon detecting an error, it prevents the updating of the stored speech encoding parameters until the following information frame, starting from the speech encoding parameters during the reception of which the error was detected. Thereby the utilization of the erroneous parameters in the decoding is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a speech decoding
method, comprising the steps of receiving information
frames containing speech encoding parameters, the first
bits in each frame forming a synchronization word, and
a synchronization check bit being thereafter repeated
at regular intervals within the frame, synchronizing a
speech decoder with the information frames received and
extracting said speech encoding parameters from said
information frames, storing the speech encoding parameters
until the following information frame is
received, decoding an encoded speech signal by means of
said stored speech encoding parameters, monitoring said
synchronization check bits to detect errors occurring
within an information frame.The GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)
is a pan-European mobile phone system, which is
becoming a world-wide standard. Figure 1 shows the basic
structural elements of the GSM system in a simplified
manner without detailed description of their properties
or the remaining parts of the system. A mobile exchange
MSC switches incoming and outgoing calls. Most of its
functions are similar to those of the exchange of a
public switched telephone network. In addition to these
normal functions, the mobile exchange also has functions
typical of mobile communications, such as subscriber
location management. Mobile stations MS are connected
to the exchange MSC by means of base station systems.
A base station system comprises a base station controller
BSC and base stations BTS. Each of the base station
controllers is used for controlling a plurality of base 
stations. A BSC performs, for example, handovers in
cases where the handover takes place between two base
stations controlled by the same BSC.The GSM system is entirely digital; even speech
transmission is carried out entirely digitally. On
account of the capacity restrictions of the radio path
used, it is necessary to have an encoding method which
is different from normal digital encoding methods and
which takes into account the special features of speech;
such a method is the RPE-LTP method (Regular Pulse
Excitation - Long Term Prediction), which utilizes both
long and short term prediction. The encoding produces
LAR, RPE and LTP parameters for transmission.In the network, various speech encoding and
rate adaption functions have been concentrated in one
transcoder unit TRCU (Transcoder/Rate Adaptor Unit). The
TRCU may have several alternative locations in the system,
depending on the choices made by the manufacturer.
When the transcoder TRCU is
