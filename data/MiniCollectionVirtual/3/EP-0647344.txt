<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes a method for recognizing alphanumeric strings spoken over a telephone network (10) wherein individual character recognition need not to be uniformly high in order to achieve high string recognition accuracy. Preferably, the method uses a processing system (14) having a digital processor, an interface (42) to the telephone network (10), and a database (32) for storing a predetermined set of reference alphanumeric strings. In operation, the system (10) prompts the caller to speak the characters of a string, and characters are recognized using a speaker-independent voice recognition algorithm (48). The method calculates recognition distances between each spoken input character and the corresponding letter or digit in the same position within each reference alphanumeric string. After each character is spoken (206), captured and analyzed (208), each reference string distance is incremented (204) and the process is continued, accumulating distances for each reference string, until the last character is spoken. The reference string with the lowest cumulative distance is then declared to be the recognized string (210).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. Patent No. 5,125,022,
and U.S. Patent No. 5,127,043.The present invention relates generally to
voice recognition techniques and more specifically
to a voice recognition/verification method and
system for enabling a caller to obtain access to one
or more services via a telephone network.Voice verification is the process of verifying
a person's claimed identity by analyzing a sample of
that person's voice. This form of security is based
on the premise that each person can be uniquely
identified by his or her voice. The degree of
security afforded by a verification technique
depends on how well the verification algorithm
discriminates the voice of an authorized user from
all unauthorized users.In US-A-4910782 a speaker verification system is disclosed where a caller verification is based on a
password as input pattern which comprises a word.It would be desirable to use voice verification
schemes to verify the identity of a telephone
caller. Such schemes, however, have not been
successfully implemented. In particular, it has
proven difficult to provide cost-effective and
accurate voice verification over a telephone
network. Generally, this is because the telephone
network is a challenging environment that degrades
the quality of speech through the introduction of
various types of noise and band-limitations. The
difficulty in providing telephone-based voice
verification is further complicated by the fact that
many types of microphones are used in conventional
telephone calling stations. These microphones
include carbon button handsets, electret handsets 
and electret speaker phones. Each of these devices
possesses unique acoustic properties that affect the
way a person's voice may sound over the telephone
network.Given the inherent limitations of the prior art
as well as the poor frequency response of the
telephone network, it has not been possible to
successively integrate a voice recognition and
verification system into a telephone network.It is an object of the present invention to
recognize alphanumeric strings spoken over a
telephone network.It is another object of the invention to
describe a method for recognizing alphanumeric
strings wherein recognition occurs on the basis of
an ensemble of alphanumeric characters as opposed to
individual character recognition.It is a thus a further object of the invention
to describe a method for recognizing alphanumeric
strings that does not require high individual
character recognition accuracy to achieve
recognition of a spoken

<CLAIMS>
A method, using a processing system, for
recognizing character strings spoken by a caller

over a telephone network, the processing system
including a digital processor, means for interfacing

to the telephone network and storage means for
storing a predetermined set of reference character

strings each having at least two characters,

comprising the steps of:

(a) initializing a cumulative recognition
distance for each of the reference character strings

to zero;
(b) prompting the caller to speak characters
in a contiguously spoken character string to be recognized, the

character string to be recognized having at least
first and second characters;
(c) analyzing the character string spoken by
the caller to locate a boundary between the first

and second characters of the spoken character string;
(d) calculating a measure of acoustical
dissimilarity between the spoken first character and

the first character of each of the reference
character strings to generate a recognition distance

for each of the reference character strings;
(e) incrementing the cumulative recognition
distance for each of the reference character strings

by the recognition distance generated in step (d);
(f) calculating a measure of acoustical
dissimilarity between the spoken second character

and the second character of each of the reference
character strings to generate a recognition distance

for each of the reference character strings;
(g) incrementing the cumulative recognition
distance for each of the reference character strings

by the recognition distance generated in step (f); 
(h) determining which of the reference
character strings has a lowest cumulative

recognition distance; and
(i) declaring the reference character string
with the lowest cumulative recognition distance to

be the character string spoken by the caller.
