<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates mainly to a seal (1) especially for a motor vehicle door, to a sealing device (3) including such a seal (1) and to a method of fitting such a seal. A seal (1) according to the invention includes an elastic base (2) which has recesses (10) for accommodating uprights (11) of a housing (12) for accommodating the base of the seal (2), against which uprights this seal tilts, and means (13) for bearing against the bottom of the said casing. The appropriate accommodating casing (12) includes an elongate opening, whose width between the uprights is less than the width of the base of the seal (2) according to the invention, measured at the location of the recesses for accommodating the said upright. Thus, the tilting of the elements of the base of the seal at the location of the recesses allows the seal to be clipped into the casing. The invention applies mainly to the motor trade.

A seal, particularly for a door of a motor vehicle, 
comprising of fixing base (2) and a sealing-tight element 

(3), characterised in that the fixing base (2) comprises arms 
(7) adapted to rock about a rocking point O between the 

bearing points A, B of the arms (7) when these latter are 
mounted on uprights (11) positioned opposite a receiving box 

section (12) defining an elongated opening, in order to 
ensure a snap-in fitment of the seal (1) into the profiled 

member or receiving box section (12) and in that the distance 
AB between the rocking bearing points corresponding to the 

width CD of the opening in the box section (12) is less than 
the sum AO + OB of the distances between each bearing point 

A, B and the rocking point O. 
A seal according to Claim 1, characterised in that it is 
symmetrical in respect of a plane (6) and in that a fixing 

base (2) comprises two arms (7) disposed symmetrically in 
relation on the said plane (6), each arm comprising a recess 

(10) for receiving an upright (11) for supporting and 
allowing rocking of the arm. 
A seal according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
arms (7) are joined by a thin layer (8) rigid with the 

sealing-tight element (3). 
A seal according to any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that it comprises bearing feet (13) capable 

of bearing on the bottom (14) of a receiving box section 
(12). 
A seal according to any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that it comprises bearing feet (15) capable 

of bearing on lateral faces (16) of a receiving box section 
(12).  

 
A seal according to any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the snap-action fitting is achieved by 

moving the arms (7) apart from each other. 
A sealing-tight device comprising a seal according to any one 
of the preceding claims and a profiled or box section for 

receiving the fixing base (2) of the said seal (1), 
characterised in that the box section comprises two uprights 

(11) placed opposite each other, the ends C,D of which define 
an elongated opening, the width CD of the said opening being 

less than the width EF of the fixing base (2) of the seal 
when this is not fitted and to the sum AO + OB of the 

distances between each bearing point A,B and the rocking 
point O. 
A device according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
sealing-tight element (3) of the seal (1) ensures sealing-tightness 

by being compressed in the direction of the 
receiving box section (12) according to the plane of symmetry 

(6) of the seal (1). 
A method of fitting a seal according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that it comprises a stage of 

penetration of the uprights (11) of the receiving box section 
(12) in the recesses (10) for receiving the arms (7) of the 

fixing base (2) of the seal (1) and a compression stage (17) 
in the direction of the opening CD in the receiving box 

section (12) until the snap-action fitment of the fixing base 
(2) in the receiving box section (12). 
A method according to Claim 9, characterised in that the 
change from the non-fitted condition to the fitted condition 

of the seal (1) is carried out by moving apart from each 
other the arms (7) of the fixing base (2).
