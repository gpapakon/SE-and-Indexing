<DESCRIPTION>
Cat scratch disease (CSD) has been the subject
of considerable clinical and microbiologic interest for
many years. An estimated 7,000 cases of cat scratch
disease occur each year in the United States. Due to
difficulty in diagnosing CSD and its potentially confusing
clinical similarity with other disease syndromes, the
number of actual cases of CSD in the United States may be
closer to 70,000 per year. CSD is described as a subacute
regional lymphadenitis temporally associated with the
scratch or bite of a cat, and it occasionally results in
meningoencephalitis.Diagnosis of CSD has been a problem because the
etiologic agent of the disease has not been previously
identified. An unidentified bacillus has been visualized
in biopsies from patients with CSD using Warthin-Starry
stain but has resisted identification because of
difficulties in obtaining an isolated culture. The
etiologic agent of CSD has recently been proposed to be
"Afipia felis" (Brenner et al., J. Clin. Microbiol.
29:2450-60, 1991). Despite these efforts, it has not been
possible thus far to isolate or otherwise associate this
agent with most persons suffering from cat scratch
disease.A clinically related disease, bacillary
angiomatosis (BA), is a condition characterized by
multiple tumors or swelling due to proliferation of the
blood vessels. BA is often found in association with an
immunocompromised condition, particularly HIV infection.
An unidentified bacillus has been visualized in the
angiomatous tissues using Warthin-Starry stain (Relman et
al., N. Eng. J. Med. 323:1573-80, 1990). DNA extracted 
from the angiomatous tissues was shown to contain a
fragment of 16S rRNA gene related to, but not identical
to, the 16S rRNA gene of Rochalimaea quintana. This DNA
was not obtained from a pure culture of the organism
(Relman et al. 1990). These investigators were unable to
isolate an infectious organism from patient tissues and,
therefore, were unable to clearly associate the DNA
sequences observed in tissues with an identifiable
disease-causing organism. Neither the organism seen in
these tissues nor the actual causative agent of the
disease was identifiable.Perkocha et al. (The New England Journal of Medicine 323:1501, 1990) studied
liver tissue from eight HIV-infected patients with peliosis hepatis, two of whom also
had cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. The histologic features seen in peliosis hepatis
associated with HIV infection were myxoid stroma and clumps of a granular purple
material that on Warthin-Starry staining and electron
