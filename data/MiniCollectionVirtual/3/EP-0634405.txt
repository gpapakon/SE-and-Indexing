<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel α-pyrimidinyl acrylic acid derivatives, the synthesis
thereof and the use of said compounds for the control of phytopathogens.α-(Pyrid-3-yl)-β-methoxy acrylates are known from EP-A-0 243 012. Said compounds
have been proposed as agricultural/horticultural fungicides. These compounds
do however not provide satisfactory control of phytopathogenic fungi under
all aspects.It has now been found that compounds of formula (Ia)

wherein
R2is hydrogen, methyl or methylthio,R4is hydrogen or methyl, andR5is hydrogen, phenyl, C1-4-alkyl, phenoxymethyl, -(C(CH3)=N-OCH3,
phenoxy, benzyloxy, -C(CH3)=N-allyloxy, -C(CH3)=N-benzyloxy, wherein
the phenyl groups are optionally substituted by one or two substituents
independently selected from cyano, methyl, methoxy, nitro or halogen,For example alkyl is methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tertiary
butyl or secondary butyl, and the various isomers of pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl,
nonyl and decyl.Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, with fluorine and chlorine being
preferred.Preferred individual compound of formula I are:
methyl α-[6-methyl-4-(3-(2-cyanophenoxy)-phenoxy)-5-pyrimidinyl]-β-methoxyacrylate;methyl α-[6-methyl-4-(3-(1-methoximinoethyl)-phenoxy)-5-pyrimidinyl]-β-methoxyacrylate;methyl α-[6-methyl-4-(3-isopropylphenoxy)-5-pyrimidinyl]-β-methoxyacrylate;methyl α-[6-methyl-4-(3-phenylphenoxy)-5-pyrimidinyl]-β-methoxyacrylate;methyl α-[2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-phenylphenoxy)-5-pyrimidinyl]-β-methoxyacrylate;methyl α-[2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-methyl-5-isopropylphenoxy)-5-pyrimidinyl]-β-methoxyacrylate;
andmethyl α-[6-methyl-4-(3-(2-methylbenzyloxy)-phenoxy)-5-pyrimidinyl]-β-methoxyacrylate.The double bond of the acrylic acid structure in the compounds of formula I may be
in E- or Z-form. In this document the E- and Z-forms are identified where meant
specifically. In all other cases mixtures of the two isomers are intended. Where E-and
Z-isomers are obtained during synthesis they may be separated by known
techniques, such as crystallisation, chromatography or destillation. In the described
methods of preparation preferably the E-forms are obtained.Compounds of formula (Ia) may be obtained by O-methylation of a compound of
formula (IIa) 

wherein R2, R4 and R5 are as defined above.The O-methylation can be carried out in a manner known per se for the preparation
of 3-methoxyacrylates employing conventional methylation agents. Examples of
suitable methylation agents include methyl iodine and dimethyl sulphate. The
