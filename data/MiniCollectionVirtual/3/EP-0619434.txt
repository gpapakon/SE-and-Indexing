<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic pressure 
equaliser device particularly suitable for 
application in load balancing systems, by means of 
which it is possible to use a pressurised fluid 
source to balance static or dynamic loads, in place 
of traditional load balancing devices, according to 
which it is possible to balance constantly a mass or 
a moving load by a pneumatic or hydraulic system, 
using small applied forces to control the 
displacement of the load. To balance the inertia or weight of moving loads or 
masses, use is generally made of mechanical 
counterweights and/or elastic systems which allow for 
a partial compensation of the weight of a body and 
the moving of even very heavy loads, with 
comparatively small applied forces in relation to the 
load to be balanced. The use of mechanical counterweighting and/or elastic 
balancing systems is considerably limited in that  
 
these systems are normally bulky or do not allow an 
adequate balancing action of the load, or behaviour, 
which is independent or unrestricted by the load to 
be controlled and its displacement direction. In particular, the need to move masses with 
acceptable speeds and accelerations, at times 
requires the use of high power levels, with 
consequently expensive and bulky drives and complex 
control systems. Pneumatic or hydraulic systems which use standard 
pressure-regulating valves are not able to achieve an 
effective balancing due to the impossibility of 
modifying the hydraulic or pneumatic action to 
balance the load while maintaining it under constant 
and strictly controlled conditions. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
pressure equaliser device in a hydraulic or pneumatic 
load balancing system, whose action is totally 
constant and independent of the mass or of the load 
to be controlled, and cannot be influenced by the 
moving direction of the load itself.  A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a pressure equaliser device for load 
balancing which is highly reliable, simple in 
construction, economical and with minimal overall 
dimensions. A further object again of the present invention is to 
provide a pressure equaliser device for a load 
balancing system, which is able to maintain an 
exactly constant balancing pressure, ensuring fast 
feed and venting or pressure releasing of the 
pressurised fluid without causing hazardous back 
pressures which otherwise could unbalance the load or 
slow down its movement. The above can be achieved by means of a
