<ABSTRACT>
A cable manufacturing method according to the 
invention comprises the steps of arranging a closing die 

(11) and a plurality of panel plates (15) in this order, 
on a pass-line having a curved zone (P3) and a linear 

zone (P1, P2), from the side of a front end of the pass-line, 
inserting all wires (2), to be stranded, through 

an opening (12) of the closing die (11), and inserting 
each wire (2) through a hole (17a, 17b) formed in a 

corresponding one of the panel plates (15), guiding the 
wires (2) such that the wires (2) are substantially 

parallel with one another and each wire (2) is loose of 
the panel plates (15), rotatably supporting the panel 

plates (15), respectively, and passing each wire (2) 
through the curved zone (P3) and the linear zone (P1, 

P2) while rotating the panel plates (15) in the same 
direction, thereby stranding the wires (2) with a large 

pitch so as not to plastically deform the wires (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for manufacturing
a cable used as a stay in a cable-stayed bridge.In general, a Parallel Wire Strand cable (PWS) is
used as a stay in a cable-stayed bridge. The PWS consists
of a bundle of plural wires arranged parallel with
one another, and has a high breaking-load strength and a
high elastic coefficient. Thus, the PWS has superior
properties for use as a stay in a cable-stayed bridge.Such a PWS is carried from a manufacturing plant
to a bridge-construction site, wound on a reel. It is
difficult to wind the PWS onto a reel neatly and a substantial
amount of time and labor are required to do so,
since the bundled parallel wires of the PWS can easily
deform.To overcome the disadvantages, the development of a
cable which has a rope structure in which the wires are
stranded has been considered. In this case, however,
each of the wires may be deformed plastically, since it
is stranded about its axis, causing the so-called
"reduction in breaking strength due to stranding" (i.e.
reduction in strength resulting from multiplying a
linear wire strength by a spining factor). This breaking
strength reduction decreases the breaking-load
strength and elastic coefficient of the cable, making it
difficult to maintain the best properties of a cable to
be used as a stay in a cable-stayed bridge. In view of the above-described circumstances, a
method for manufacturing a cable suitable for a cable-stayed
bridge has been developed (see Jpn. Pat. Appln.
KOKAI Publication No. 3-60954). The cable obtained by
the use of this method has substantially the same
breaking-load strength and elastic coefficient as a PWS,
and can be wound on a reel without causing great deformation
of the cross section due to stranding.Recently, large cable-stayed bridges, such as channel
bridges, have been constructed; and accordingly a
cable of as long as 300 - 500 m has been required. In
producing such a long cable, closing dies and panel
plates must be located in a linear pass-line with the
approximate same length as that of the cable. This
means that a facility as long as the cable must be built
on the manufacturing plant site. In reality, however,
it is difficult to construct such a long facility on the
site. A method and an apparatus for laying up elongated
members, particularly hoses and electrical cable cores
is disclosed in US-A-4 151 704. The hoses and cores
are initially laid out horizontally and threaded through
tubes extending between a plurality of lay plates. The
hoses and cores are pulled from the
