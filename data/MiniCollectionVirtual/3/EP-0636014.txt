<ABSTRACT>
Novel principles for treating urological and gastric fluid reflux disorders are disclosed involving the injection of textured micro particles (30) wherein the textured micro particles having a combination of average unidimensional particle size range and average particle texture cooperate substantially to prevent loss of the micro particles from any injection site (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed
to the
treatment of urological disorders, e.g., incontinence,
vesicoureteral reflux etc., by
endoscopic injection of compatible micro particle implants
into the submucosal tissue. Since the invention is closely
related to the treatment of incontinence, it will be
described in detail by reference thereto.With the exception of urinary incontinence secondary
to neurogenic disorders, incontinence occurs when the
resistance to urine flow has decreased excessively, i.e.,
urethral resistance to urine outflow, from whatever cause,
has been lowered to the point when it can no longer resist
increased intra-abdominal pressure. While this may seem to
be an oversimplification of the problem, in general nearly
all procedures developed to restore continence are designed
on this basis to restore the lost resistance to urine
outflow. Similarly, the present invention allows for the
control of gastric fluid reflux when submucosal injections
of the micro implants are made to the esophageal-gastric
junction and to the gastric-pyloric junction.To these ends, several surgical procedures and devices
have heretofore been developed and tried with varying
degrees of success, e.g., suspension procedures,
plications, constrictive procedures and various
combinations of these. Devices which have been developed
primarily operate as plugs and cannot be used on a
permanent basis. Electrical stimulation and biofeedback 
techniques have so far been demonstrated to have limited
success in treatment of incontinence and gastric reflux.As examples of such treatments and procedures
heretofore known in the art, mention may be made of a
variety of prosthetic devices based on the compression of
the urethra at a given point. (See, for example,
"Treatment of urinary incontinence by implantable
prosthetic sphincter," by Bradley and Timm, Urology, 1:252
(1973); "Treatment of post-prostatectomy urinary
incontinence using a gel prostheses", by Kaufman, Brit. J.
Urol., 45:646 (1973) and "Treatment of post-prostatectomy
urinary incontinence using a silicon gel prostheses", Brit.
J. Urol., 48:646 (1973).In the practice of plastic and reconstructive surgery,
inert materials have frequently been implanted to fill in
defects or augment weakened tissue. These have been
fabricated of a variety of materials and have been
implanted using several techniques.Certain very small particle species compounded in a
lubricious material have been implanted by subcutaneous
injection for both soft and hard tissue augmentation.
Heretofore success
