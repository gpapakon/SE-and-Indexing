<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electroluminescent device or display device comprising an organic 
electroluminescent material for use in data display, 
optical data processing and other fields. In data display, optical data processing and other 
fields, recent attention has been drawn to organic 
electroluminescent materials. 
Electroluminescent materials emit light having a 
wavelength and an intensity characteristic of the material 
when it is sandwiched between electrodes and a voltage is 
applied thereto. It is believed that electrons and holes 
are injected from the electrodes into the 
organic electroluminescent material and moved in the 
organic electroluminescent material by the applied voltage, 
followed by recombination of the holes and electrons. The 
emitted light has a spectrum nearly identical with a 
fluorescence spectrum intrinsic for the electroluminescent 
material. Organic and inorganic electroluminescent materials are 
known. The organic electroluminescent materials include  
 
blue electroluminescence-inducing anthracene known from 
old. The inorganic electroluminescent materials include 
well known semiconductors. LED (light emitting diode) 
inducing red or yellow electroluminescence is now drawing 
attention as a highly bright and stable electroluminescent 
material. 
LEDs inducing red, orange and green electroluminescences 
are combined in practical use for a three-color 
display for streets. Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 51, No. 12 (1987), pp 913-915 
describes a two-layer electroluminescent device (EL device) 
prepared with the use of organic electroluminescent 
materials. This two-layer electroluminescent device is 
prepared by successively forming on an electrode of ITO 
(indium tin oxide) a hole injecting layer, an 
electroluminescent layer capable of transporting electrons 
and an electron injecting electrode of an MgAg alloy by 
vapor deposition. When a voltage of several tens of 
volts is applied to this electroluminescent device, 
electrons and holes are injected into the 
electroluminescent layer to emit light. With this 
two-layer electroluminescent device, the color of the emitted 
light can be changed by choosing the type of the 
electroluminescent material. For example, a low molecular 
compound of an aluminum quinolinol complex (Alq3) used 
as the electroluminescent material provides a green electroluminescence.  
 However, this two-layer electroluminescent device has 
a drawback in that the above 
low molecular compound deposited as an electroluminescent layer
