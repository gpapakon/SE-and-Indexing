<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is an active matrix electroluminescent display (AMELD) having
an improved light emitting efficiency and methods of operating the AMELD to
produce gray scale operation.Thin film electroluminescent (EL) displays are well known in the art and are
used as flat screen displays in a variety of applications. A typical display includes
a plurality of picture elements (pixels) arranged in rows and columns. Each pixel
comprises an EL phosphor active layer between a pair of insulators and a pair of
electrodes.Electroluminescent (EL) displays are known from US-A-4 087 792 and US-A-4
602 192.US-A-4 087 792 discloses an electroluminescent display comprising an array
of pixels, each pixel including:
a first transistor having its gate connected to a select line, its source connected
to a second transistor;the second transistor having its drain connected to a first electrode of an
electroluminescent cell; andsaid electroluminescent cell having a second electrode.US-A-4 087 792 discloses a similar display where the source of the second
transistor is connected to the electroluminescent cell.Early EL displays were only operated in a multiplexed mode. Recently active
matrix technology known in the liquid crystal display art has been applied to EL
displays. A known AMELD includes a circuit at each pixel comprising a first
transistor having its gate connected to a select line, its source connected to a data line
and its drain connected to the gate of a second transistor and through a first capacitor
22 to ground. The drain of the second transistor is connected to ground potential, its
source is connected through a second capacitor to ground and to one electrode of an
EL cell. The second electrode of the EL cell is connected to a high voltage 
alternating current source for excitation of the phosphor.This AMELD operates as follows. During a first portion of a frame load
(LOAD) all the data lines are sequentially turned ON. During a particular data line
ON, the select lines are strobed. On those select lines having a select line voltage,
transistor 14 turns on allowing charge from data line 18 to accumulate on the gate of
transistor 20 and on capacitor 22, thereby turning transistor 20 on. At the completion
of the LOAD cycle the second transistors of all activated pixels are on. During the
second portion of the frame time (ILLUMINATE), the AC high voltage source 28 is
turned on. Current flows from the source 28 through the EL cells 26 and the
transistor 20 to ground in each activated pixels, producing an
