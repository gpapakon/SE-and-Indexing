The invention relates to an appliance (1) for cutting hair with a toothed cutting device (7) which exhibits a stationary cutter (10) with a series of cutting teeth (11) and a cutter (12) which can be driven back and forth and has a series of cutting teeth (13), the two cutters (10, 12) bearing against one another under a spring loading (19) at least by means of part of the running surfaces (15, 16) of their cutting teeth (11, 12), and the running surfaces (15) of the cutting teeth (11) of one cutter (10) being designed to run in a slightly concave manner away from the free tooth ends (32), parallel to the tooth direction (31). In the case of said appliance, the other cutter (12) is designed to run in a slightly concave manner between the two outermost cutting teeth (13' and 13'') parallel to the direction of the series of cutting teeth (13).
