<ABSTRACT>
Device for transmitting electric power signals at variable frequencies and with variable phases from a fixed system (1) to a rotating system (2). The primary winding (4) of a rotating transformer is fed by an electrical source at the fixed frequency and the secondary winding (6) feeds a switched-mode power supply (8), while a digital memory (9) delivers a digital signal containing the desired characteristics which, after conversion in a digital/analog converter (10) is amplified in an amplifier (11).
