<ABSTRACT>
A color selecting electrode mounting frame of a CRT which eliminates the 
waste of materials, is easy to process and assemble, and is low cost of production 

and a process for production of the same. The color selecting electrode mounting 
frame (30) for a CRT comprises a pair of long members (34) of an L-sectional 

shape having curved surfaces (38) formed at their top edge portions to which two 
opposing sides of a color selecting electrode (10) are attached and a pair of short 

members (36) having end portions joined to the two ends of these long members 
(34). The long members are obtained by blanking a plate (60) of a fixed width into 

an arc shape (62) of a predetermined curvature, then forming this into an 
L--sectional shape and a curvature matching the panel glass surface of the CRT. 

The two end portions (37) of the short members (36) are processed to match the 
curvature of the two end portions of the long members (34). The end portions (37) 

of the short members (36) are processed by a twisting, crushing, or shaving 
process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of a colour selection electrode mounting frame for a CRT and to a CRT comprising a colour selection electrode comprising a mounting frame made by this process.Inside of a CRT, an aperture grille, shadow mask, or other color selection
electrode is placed in front of the fluorescent screen of the panel. The color
selection electrode is attached to a color selecting electrode mounting frame and is
positioned with high precision with respect to the electron guns and fluorescent
screen.A color selection electrode mounting frame according to the prior art is
shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the color selection electrode mounting frame
2 is comprising a pair of long members 4, 4 and a pair of short members 6, 6 joined
to the two end portions of these long members 4, 4.At the top edge portions of the long members 4, 4 are formed curved surfaces
8, 8 to which two opposing sides of the color selecting electrode 10 are attached.
The curved surfaces 8, 8 have curvatures matching with the curvature of the panel
glass of the CRT. The color selection electrode 10 has formed in it apertures 12 for
passing the electron beams.The short members 6, 6 are bent in a substantially U-shape. The short
members 6, 6 are bent in a substantially U-shape so as to secure the height from
the bottom surface of the frame 2 to the color selecting electrode 10.When producing the color selection electrode mounting frame 2 of the prior
art, the long members 4 and the short members 6 are separately fabricated. When
fabricating a long member 4, as shown in Fig. 2A, first an L-sectional shape rod
material 14 is produced. This rod material 14 is formed by cold drawing or rolling
a circular cross-section rod material.Next, the rod material 14 is cut into a predetermined length to obtain a long
member preform 14a of an L-sectional shape. Next, as shown in Fig. 2B, the long
member preform 14a is set between a punch 16 and a die 18 and formed so as to
give it a predetermined curvature. Next, as shown in Fig. 2C, the two end portions
of the preform 14a are cut off to remove the unnecessary portions 14b of excess
lengths of 10 to 15 mm and fabricate the long members 4. At the top edge portion 
of the long member 4, a curved surface 8 for attachment of one side of the color
selection electrode 10 shown in Fig. 1 is formed.When producing a short member 6 shown in Fig. 1, first, as shown in Fig.
3A, a square sectional shaped rod material 16 is cut into a predetermined length to
obtain a

A process for the production of a colour selection electrode mounting
frame for a CRT comprising the steps of:


blanking a plate (60) of a fixed width into an arc of a predetermined
curvature to form an arc-shaped member (62),
forming the arc-shaped member (62) into an L-sectional shape and a
curvature which matches a panel glass surface of the CRT and forming on the top

edge portion a curved surface (38) on which one of two opposing sides of a colour
selection electrode (10) is attached, and
arranging a pair of said long members (34) in parallel and joining short
members (36) to the bottoms of the two ends so as to bridge the ends.
The process for production of a colour selection electrode mounting
frame for a CRT as set forth in claim 1, further comprising a step of coining the

bottom edge portions of said long members (34) to form single-sided tapers (40)
of not more than 40 percent of the thickness of said long members.
The process for production of a colour selection electrode mounting
frame for a CRT as set forth in claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising a step of

forming step-like projections (42) at the substantial centre portions of said short
members (36) so as to adjust the heights (h) from said curved surfaces (38) of said

long members (34) to the bottom surfaces of said short members (36).
The process for production of a colour selection electrode mounting
frame for a CRT as set forth in claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising a step of

processing the two end portions (37) of said short members (36) so as to match the
curvature of the two end portions of said long members (34).
The process for production of a colour selection electrode mounting
frame for a CRT as set forth in claim 4, further comprising a step of processing the

end portions (37) of said short members (36) to match the curvature of the two end
portions of said long members (34) by any one of a twisting, crushing, and

shaving process.
