<ABSTRACT>
The first object is to provide a package in which a 
fluctuation of winding tension can be avoided and the winding 

characteristics are uniform from the most inner to the most 
outer layer. The second object is to correctly conduct speed 

control immediately after the rotational speed control of the 
spindle has been switched. 
When a yarn is wound by a winder in which a spindle (2) 
having a positively driven pressure roller (5) is positively 

driven, the pressure roller (5) is positioned so that it is not 
contacted with a tube (100) immediately after the yarn setting 

operation. After a predetermined amount of yarn layer has 
been formed on the tube (100), the pressure roller (5) is moved 

so that it is contacted with the yarn layer on the tube (100). 
The surface speed of the pressure roller (5) is controlled to 

be higher than that of an empty tube until the yarn is 
switched to the empty tube side, wherein the controlled speed 

is approximately the same as or lower than the surface speed 
of a fully loaded tube, and the surface speed of the pressure 

roller is controlled to be approximately the same as the 
surface speed of the empty tube after the yarn has been 

switched to the empty tube. 
Both end portions of the frame body (13) supporting the pressure 
roller (5) are supported by at least two hydraulic cylinders (22,23). An 

electric motor (6) is provided at one or both end portions of the 
pressure roller (5). A heat conductive member (67) is inserted in a 

housing portion of the electric motor (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a yarn winder
which winds a yarn at a speed not less than 4000 m/min.In general, when a yarn is wound after it has been
spun out from a spinning machine, a winder is used which
includes; a spindle to which a tube is attached, wherein the
spindle is rotatably mounted on a machine frame; a traverse
unit disposed at an upper position of the spindle, wherein
the traverse unit can be elevated in a vertical direction
with respect to the machine frame; and a pressure roller
coming into contact with a tube attached to the spindle so
that a predetermined surface pressure can be given to the
tube.In the case where the winding speed is not less
than 6000 m/min, the spindle and pressure roller are
positively rotated by a drive unit for preventing the tube
surface from being damaged when it is rubbed by the pressure
roller, and also even in the case where the winding speed is
4000 m/min to 6000 m/min, the spindle and pressure roller are
positively rotated for improving a package configuration.When the spindle rotating at the high speed
described above is switched from a fully loaded tube to an
empty tube, the speed of the fully loaded tube is slightly
increased and the winding tension is increased so that the
yarn can be more strongly wound in yarn catching grooves
formed on the tube, and so that the yarn tension can be
stabilized for preventing the yarn from being wound around a
godet roller disposed on the upstream side of the winder. However, in the case where the pressure roller is
driven at a predetermined speed, a yarn on the upstream side
of the winder is wound by the fully loaded tube after it has
come into contact with the pressure roller. Therefore, when
an increase of the speed of the fully loaded tube is small,
tension of the yarn on the upstream side of the winder is not
increased, so chat the yarn is wound around the godet roller
due to a decrease of tension when the yarn is switched. In
this way, the yarn switching operation fails. When the
increase of the speed of the fully loaded tube is large,
tension applied between the pressure roller and the fully
loaded tube is greatly increased, so that the yarn is torn
off when it comes into contact with the tube. In this way,
the yarn switching operation also fails. Further, a problem
is caused in which the yarn tension fluctuates in the case
where the yarn is switched so that the characteristics of the
yarn wound in the most outside layer are changed.In an ordinary yarn taking up operation, and yarn
switching operation,
