<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of teaching points which are on a straight 
line in a space and are to be taught are written in a program. 

When the position of an arbitrary one out of the points is modified 

by shifting the teaching point by a certain distance along 
the straight line, the position after modification can be easily 

found without consciousness of the coordinate system. The position 
after the modification is determined as a position vector 

from the position vector of the point before the modification, 
the distance of the shift along the straight line, and the position 

vectors of two other arbitrary points on the straight line. While 
observing the display attached to a manual input device for the 

robot controller, the operator inputs manually the position of 
the teaching points to be modified, the two arbitrary teaching 

points on the straight line, and the amount of shift required for 
the modification.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a position 
teaching method applicable to robots for industrial and 
other uses, which operate according to a taught program, 
and, more particularly to a position teaching method for 
robots applicable when modifying the position which has 
already been taught (taught position). When a robot for industrial or other use 
(hereinafter simply called a robot), which operates 
according to a taught program, is used to perform 
various operations, the need for changing the position 
taught by a program arises frequently. In changing the taught position, one of the 
generally practiced methods is to move the robot 
actually to the modified position (that is, the taught 
position to be realized after the modification has been 
made) by manual feeding or with other means to store the 
position, or to input the data of modified position 
directly. However, when the amount of the modification 
is known in advance, it is popular for the operator to 
input the amount of position modification for changing 
the taught position. As a typical example of modifying the taught 
position, there is a case where only the taught position 
is changing without changing the direction between 
taught positions in the program already taught before  
 
performing the actual operation. For example, in the case where position teaching 
has been performed for a robot in a form of program 
teaching to perform operations such as grasping, 
carrying, or arc welding on a plurality of workpieces of 
a predetermined size L arranged linearly at 
predetermined intervals D, when the predetermined 
interval D or the predetermined size L is changed, it is 
apparently inefficient to perform teaching by manual 
feeding or re-preparation of the entire program. Thus, 
it is preferable for the operator to input the taught 
position modification data. Conventionally, in such a case as is described 
above, the operator had to perform preparatory work to 
specify the position modification data represented on 
the same coordinate system as that on which the already 
taught position data are based or the data which can be 
converted into the position change data in the robot 
controller (the position modification data represented 
on the coordinate system which has been set in advance 
for the robot or on the reference coordinate system). As described above, to input the taught position 
modification data by the conventional method, 
preparatory work is required to specify the position 
modification data represented on the

A position teaching method for a robot in which 
the position of any taught point, out of a plurality of 

taught points taught in a program so as to be arranged 
on one straight line in space, is modified by moving 

said taught point a distance along said straight line, 
   wherein, the modified position of the taught point 

to be modified is determined based on the position 
information before modification, the distance of 

movement along said straight line, and the position 
information of two arbitrary taught points located on 

said straight line. 
A position teaching method for a robot in which 

the position of any taught point, out of a plurality of 
taught points taught in a program so as to be arranged 

on one straight line in space, is modified by moving 
said taught point a distance along said straight line, 

   wherein the modified position of the taught point 
to be modified is determined as a position vector based 

on the position vector before modification, the distance 
of movement along said straight line, and the respective 

position vectors of two arbitrary taught points located 
on said straight line. 
A position teaching method for a robot according 
to claim 2, wherein when the position vector before 

modification of the taught point to be modified is taken 
as 〈OPs〉, the distance of movement along said straight 

line as δs, and the position vectors for two arbitrary 
taught points located on said straight line as 〈Dj〉 and 

〈Di〉, respectively, the modified position vector 〈OQs〉 
of said taught point to be modified is determined from 

the following equation:〈OQs〉 = 〈OPS〉 + (δs/dij) 〈Dij〉 
 

where,〈Dij〉 = 〈Dj〉 - 〈Di〉 dij = |〈Dij〉|
