<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for treating hot process gases 
produced in high temperature processes in a circulating 

fluidized bed reactor. The reactor (10) comprises a mixing 
chamber (12), a particle separator (16) and a return 

duct (18) for returning the circulating mass from the 
particle separator to the mixing chamber. The return 

opening (24) of the return duct is so arranged that the 
flow of solids entering the mixing chamber via the opening 

is directed substantially downwardly. The inlet (22) 
for hot process gas is so arranged as to allow the hot 

process gas to flow into the mixing chamber as a substantially 
upwardly directed solids flow so that the solids 

flow comes into contact with the gas flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for treating hot process gases produced in high temperature 
processes in a circulating fluidized bed reactor, 
whereby the reactor comprises 
a mixing chamber, in which the hot process gases are 
mixed with the solids forming the circulating mass to 
form a gas suspension; a particle separator for separating the solids from the 
treated process gases; means for feeding the hot process gases into the mixing 
chamber; a riser or a duct arranged on top of the mixing chamber 
in connection therewith for conducting the gas suspension 
from the mixing chamber to the particle separator; a gas outlet for removing the treated process gases 
from the particle separator and a solids return duct for returning the solids separated 
in the particle separator to the mixing chamber. Circulating fluidized bed reactors are especially suitable 
for cooling hot gases containing molten and/or vaporized 
components and/or tar-like particles. Circulating bed gas coolers are thus suitable for dry 
purifying of gases containing dust and tar and other 
condensable components resulting from partial oxidation 
of biomasses, peat or coal. The gas fed into the mixing 
chamber can be quickly cooled by means of the high-volume 
return flow of solids from the particle separator in the 
return duct to a temperature level, at which harmful 
gaseous or liquid components are condensed and tarry 
substances turn to dry, solid substances. The solids can 
then be easily separated from the cooled gas.  
 Circulating bed gas coolers can also be used in chemical 
processing, for example preheating and pre-reduction of 
iron concentrate, whereby the concentrate is firstly 
preheated and pre-reduced in the fluidized bed by means 
of the hot process gas from iron smelting. As the preferable 
temperature for reducing is 800-950Â°C, cooling surfaces 
for adjusting the temperature of the circulating 
mass will have to be built into the circulating mass 
reactor to maintain this temperature. The preheating and 
reducing of iron concentrate is usually not sufficient 
for cooling. The necessary cooling surfaces are usually 
located as convection heat surfaces in the riser or duct 
located above the mixing chamber. In the above-mentioned circulating bed gas coolers the 
mixing chamber is a fluidization chamber of the so-called 
spouting bed type, i.e. a fluidization chamber provided 
with a jet flow, in which the hot process gas also acts 
as the fluidizing gas. The fluidization chamber, i.e. the
