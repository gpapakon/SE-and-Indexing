<ABSTRACT>
An optical system mounted on a helmet (29) for superimposing a collimated image of a display object on the external view of the helmet's wearer comprising: display object means (1a, 1b) mounted on the helmet for generating a display; a concave collimator (6a, 6b) for collimating light from said display; an optical relay unit (3a, 3b) located in the forehead region for generating an intermediate image of said display in the focal plane of the collimator; a reflecting surface (4a, 4b) for reflecting display light from the relay unit towards the collimator; and an inclined combiner (5) essentially transparent to incoming display light and to the wearer's external view, for reflecting display light reflected from the collimator towards the viewer's eye.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compact optical systems, especially to portable
optical systems adapted to project images across the wearer's field of
view. The invention has particular, but not exclusive, application to the
provision of head-up display images for aircrew. and provides a means by
which an optical system may be employed to convert an image provided by a
small cathode ray tube (CRT), matrix array or other light source
(typically mounted on the flying helmet) into a collimated, head-up form
suitable for the display of information. Other possible applications of
the invention are in connection with military and high-performance
vehicles.There is an increasing need for this provision in both fixed and
rotary-wing aircraft, the information to be displayed being required to
complement the electronic display facilities installed in the aircraft
cockpit. Whilst any presentation of information in a head-up format (in
accordance with established criteria) will enhance operator performance, a
particularly useful facility provided by head-mounted displays would be
the display of information superimposed over the viewer's outside view in
whatever direction the viewer's head was pointing.Unfortunately, severe inertia and volume constraints are placed on the
provision of equipment supported on the human neck, and in this respect
particularly strict limits are imposed for fast-jet applications where a
need for greater head freedom compounds difficulties already aggravated by
the effects of high-g manoeuvres. Other requirements, essential for
fast-jet operation, such as the provision of safe ejection and birdstrike
protection, are not needed in rotary wing operations which are restricted
to a much smaller flight envelope with no requirement for emergency
ejection (in the same sense). For the latter applications it is therefore
relatively straightforward to supply more facilities and to achieve a
higher technical performance. The system may operate in a monocular configuration but it may be adapted for binocular operation by
the additional provision of a second unit which is essentially a mirror image of the first.Good optical accuracy is required for this and a quite severe specification must be applied for
binocular disparity, in order to avoid double imaging in the overlap portions of the display. It is an
object of the invention to eliminate the problems of double imaging, to reduce outside-world
distortion and enhance the rigidity of the optical system.This invention accordingly consists of an optical

<CLAIMS>
An optical system mounted on a helmet (29) for superimposing a collimated image
of a display object on the external view of the helmet's wearer comprising;


display object means (1a, 1b) mounted on the helmet for generating a display;
a reflective collimator (
6a, 6b) for collimating light from
said display;
an inclined combiner (31) essentially transparent to incoming display light and to the wearer's
external view, for reflecting display light reflected from the collimator (6a, 6b) towards the

viewer's eye; the collimator being located away from the wearer's external view through the
combiner (31)
and including two such substantially symmetrical systems, one for each eye, characterised in that said combiner is
a planar, diffractive combiner (31), common to both eyes.
An optical system as claimed in claim 1 further including an optical relay
unit (3a, 3b) located in the forehead region for generating an intermediate image of said

display in the focal plane of the collimator; and

a reflecting surface (4a, 4b) for reflecting display light from the relay unit towards the
collimator, wherein the collimator is located on the opposite side of the said external view

with respect to the optical relay unit (3a, 3b).
An optical system according to any preceding claim further including at
least one additional reflecting surface (2a, 2b) to re-orientate the head-up image.
An optical system according to any preceding claim further including
means for enabling the images on two different display object means (1, 8) to be

superimposed on one another.
An optical system according to claim 4 in which said means comprises
at least one partially reflecting surface (12) so that the light from one object means is

reflected at said surface and light from the other object means is transmitted through said
surface. 
An optical system according to claim 5 in which said
partially reflecting surface is a reflector in which the selective waveband of reflection changes

with angle of incidence.
An optical system according to any preceding claim and further incorporating an eye
sensor (20) for detecting the direction in which the viewer's eyes are pointing.
An optical system according to claim 7 in which the eye sensor comprises an
infra-red light source (20) for illuminating one of the viewer's eyes, and a concave reflecting

surface (24) located essentially coincident with the collimator (6) for focusing the infra red light
reflected off the eye on to a detector located generally above the combiner.
An optical system according to claim 7 in which the eye sensor
comprises an infra-red light source (20) for illuminating one of the viewer's eyes, and a

narrow-band infra-red reflecting coating on the collimator (6) for focusing the infra red
light reflected off the eye on to a detector located generally above the combiner.
