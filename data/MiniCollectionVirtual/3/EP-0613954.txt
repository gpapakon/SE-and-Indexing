<ABSTRACT>
During fructose crystallization by cooling a fructose 
solution, the rate of cooling is first reduced and then increased 

again. The reduced cooling rate is preferably in the temperature 
band 46 ± 3°C and this controlled cooling results in an improved 

product. The process preferably uses the mother liquor remaining 
after crystallization for the preparation of a liquid phase 

sweetener.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of
crystalline fructose. More particularly, the process involves
crystallizing fructose by cooling a solution of fructose such that
differing levels of supersaturation are produced during different
periods of crystal growth.Fructose is a monosaccharide highly valued as a nutritive
sweetener. The vast majority of fructose sold in the USA is
derived from corn starch with the principal form of the product
being High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS). The commercially available
and used syrups contain from 42% to 90% by weight fructose on a dry
solids basis (dsb) with the remainder predominately being dextrose.
The HFCS commonly used as a sucrose replacement in soft drinks
typically comprises 55% fructose, 41% dextrose, and 4% higher
saccharides (all percentages dsb). The solids content of such a
syrup is usually about 77% by weight.On an industrial scale, the production of HFCS commences with
the enzymatic liquefaction of a purified starch slurry. The
principal source of raw material in the United States is corn
starch obtained by the wet milling process. However, starches of
comparable purity from other sources can be employed.In the first step of a typical process a starch slurry is
gelatinized by cooking at high temperature. The gelatinized starch
is then liquefied and dextrinized by thermostable alpha-amylase in
a continuous two-stage reaction. The product of this reaction is
a soluble dextrin hydrolysate with a dextrose equivalent (DE) of
6-15, suitable for the subsequent saccharification step.Following liquefaction-dextrinization, the pH and temperature
of the 10-15 DE hydrolysate is adjusted for the saccharification
step. During saccharification the hydrolysate is further
hydrolyzed to dextrose by the enzymatic action of glucoamylase.
Although saccharification can be carried out as a batch reaction,
a continuous saccharification is practised in most modern plants.
In the continuous saccharification reaction, glucoamylase is added
to a 10-15 DE hydrolysate following pH and temperature adjustment.
The carbohydrate composition of typical high-dextrose
saccharification liquor is: 94-96% dextrose, 2-3% maltose; 0.3-0.5% 
maltotriose; and 1-2% higher saccharides (all percentages dsb).
The product will typically be 25 to 37% dry substance. This high-dextrose
hydrolysate is then refined to produce dextrose feedstock
for the isomerization reaction.Preparation of very high-quality dextrose feedstock for
isomerization is necessary because of the very low color
