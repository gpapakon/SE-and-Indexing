<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve the installation of the linear connector into the spacer profiles, it is proposed to design the linear connector such that protrusions (2a,2b) on the parallel narrow sides of the body (1), which protrusions are arranged at a distance from one another in the longitudinal direction of the body and at an angle  alpha  of approximately 30 DEG -50 DEG  with respect to the longitudinal axis B of the body, comprise lamellae which taper from the inside towards the outside to the border of the body, whose alignment angle on one length piece (6) differs from the alignment angle on the other length piece (7) by approximately 90 DEG , and whose tips (8) can be bent elastically by the profile wall when they are pushed into the profile hollow, the tips (23,24) of the mutually facing lamellae (2c,2d) at the ends of the two length pieces serving as stop elements in the centre of the body (1) and forming a gap (11) between them, and that cutting bur restraints (5) in the form of mutually facing run-on floats (14) are located on the surface of the body, in the region of the stop elements, which restraints rise up out of the surface of the body and form a gap (22) between them.

Linear connector of plastic material for joining hollow spacing profiles of multiple 
insulating glass units to be bent on a bending machine, which connector having a flat, 

longitudinal body, of which one piece of length may be inserted into the one spacing 
profile and the other piece of length into the other spacing profile of the two profiles 

which are be joined, which connector having a surface provided with abutment elements 
striking during the insertion of the linear connector into the hollow space of the spacing 

profiles the front faces of the profile opposing one another, and which connector is 
provided moreover with projections for increasing the friction force between the surfaces 

of the linear connector and the inner wall of the profile, characterized in that the 
projections consisting of ribs (2a, 2b) tapering from inside to outside in the direction of 

the edge of the body and distantly located from one another in longitudinal direction of 
the body at the parallel narrow sides (3, 4) of the body (1) under an angle α of about 30° 

- 50° to the longitudinal axis B of the body, the angle of adjustment of said ribs located 
on the one longitudinal piece (6) is different from the angle of adjustment of said ribs on 

the other longitudinal piece (7) by about 90° and the peaks (8) of the ribs can be bend 
elastically during insertion into the hollow space of the profiles by the wall of the profile, 

the construction being such that the peaks (23, 24) of the ribs (2c, 2d) opposite to one 
another at the ends of the two longitudinal pieces (6, 7) in the center of the body (1) are 

functioning as abutment elements and forming a gap (11) therebetween and that on the 
surface of the body ends within the range of the abutment elements cutting burr brakes 

are provided configured as running up slopes (14) opposite to one another, arising from 
the surface ofthe body (1) and forming between themselves a gap (22). 
Linear connector according to claim 1, characterized in that the distance D of the 
opposite peaks (23, 24) of the ribs (2c, 2d) forming the abutment elements corresponds 

to about the width E of the gap of the cutting burr brake. 
Linear connector according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the ribs (2a, 2b, 2c, 
2d) being inclined to the respective direction of insertion are provided at their backside 

ends (9) with the circular portion as part ofthe body (1).  
 
Linear connector according to clailm 1 or 3, characterized in that the peaks (23, 24) of 
the opposing ribs (2c, 2d) forming the abutment elements are configured in the center of 

the body (1) such that the ribs (2c, 2d) in the range of their frontside ends are provided 
with parts (10a, 10b) opposing one another and extending in general parallel to the 

longitudinal axis B of the body. 
Linear connector according to claim 1, characterized in that the space C enclosed by 
two ribs (2a

) following to one another is broadened in the direction of 
the peaks (8, 10) ofthe ribs. 
Linear connector according to one of the claims 1 - 5, characterized in that the 
running up slopes (14) arising from the surface of the body (1) extend under an angle of 

about 6° to said surface. 
Linear connector according to one of the claims 1 - 6, characterized in that the upper 
side (13) and the lower side (15) of the body (1) are provided with parallel longitudinal 

grooves (16, 17; 18, 19). 
Linear connector according to claim 7, characterized in that between the parallel 
longitudinal grooves (18, 19) on the upper side (13) of the body (1) are provided several 

hole-like recesses (20) into which the material of the profile may be pressed. 
Linear connector according to one of the claims 1 - 8, characterized in that the cutting 
burr brakes (5) are provided only on the upper side (13) ofthe body (1). 
Linear connector according to one ofthe claims 1 - 9, characterized in that the cross 
section (21) of the ribs (2a, 2b) corresponds generally to the cross section of the edge 

area of the hollow profiles which are to be joined.
