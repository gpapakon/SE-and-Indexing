<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a multi-coordinate feeler head (probe) in accordance with the invention, the feeler (3) is mounted on a flexural pivot (crosspring joint) (7) in order to increase stiffness. The flexural pivot (7) permits the feeler (3) to be swung on one coordinate axis (X). Guides in the form of leaf spring parallelograms (5, 6) are provided for the two other coordinate axes (Y, Z).

<CLAIMS>
Multi-coordinate feeler head with a feeler pin (3)
deflectable in a plurality of co-ordinate axes (X,Y,Z)

relative to a holder (4), a rectilinear guide means
(5,6;20) being provided in a first co-ordinate axis

(Y,Z;Z) at least for the deflection, characterised in
that, for deflection in a second co-ordinate axis (X;X,Y)

extending vertically to the first, a flexural pivot
(7;21,22) is provided and the feeler pin (3), upon a

deflection in this co-ordinate axis (X;X,Y) is pivoted
about the axis of rotation (D1,D2) of the flexural pivot

(7;21,22) while a linear scanning movement in the second
co-ordinate axis (X;X,Y) is converted into a pivoting

movement of the feeler pin (3), and in that the
rectilinear guide means is a leaf spring parallelogram

(5,6) or a roller or sliding guide (20).
Multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1,
characterised in that the feeler pin (3) is secured to the

leaf springs (71,72,73) of the flexural pivot (7), and in
that the connection between the flexural pivot (7) and the

holder (4) has at least one leaf spring parallelogram (5)
which is secured to the holder (4).
Multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 2,
characterised in that the feeler pin (3) is attached to

one set of ends of the leaf springs (71,72,73) of the
flexural pivot (7), so that a deflection of the feeler pin

(3) is possible in the second co-ordinate axis (X),
further in that there are attached to the other ends of

the leaf springs (71,72,73) of the flexural pivot (7)
bridges (8,9) extending vertically to the second co-ordinate 

axis (X) and parallel to the axis (A) of the
feeler pin (3), on which the one set of ends of the first

leaf spring parallelogram (6) are mounted for deflection
of the feeler pin (3) in the first co-ordinate axis (Y),

the leaf springs (6) of this parallelogram extending
parallel to the axis (A) of the feeler pin (3), further in

that the other ends of the first leaf spring parallelogram
(6) are attached to an intermediate part (10), on which in

turn the first ends of a further leaf spring parallelogram
(5) are attached, and in that the leaf springs (5) of this

parallelogram extend vertically to the axis (A) of the
feeler pin and vertically to the longitudinal axis of the

first leaf spring parallelogram (6), and further in that
the other ends of the further leaf spring parallelogram

(5) are attached to the holder (4).
Multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 3,
characterised in that the leaf springs (6) of the first

parallelogram are disposed symmetrically with the axis of
the feeler pin (3) and enclose two sides of a space in

which the flexural pivot (7) is disposed, further in that
the leaf springs (5) of the further parallelogram define

two sides of a space in which the flexural pivot (7) and
the first leaf spring parallelogram (6) are located.
Multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1,
characterised in that, in order to deflect the feeler pin

(3) in a third coordinate axis (Y) which extends
vertically to the first and second coordinate axis (Z,X),

a further flexural pivot (22) is provided, and the feeler
pin (3), upon a deflection in this third coordinate axis

(Y) is pivoted about the axis of rotation (D2) of the
flexural pivot (22), a linear scanning movement in the 

third coordinate axis (Y) being converted into a pivoting
movement of the feeler pin (3).
Multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 1,
characterised in that the feeler pin (3) is linearly

displaceably mounted in a carrier (23) via a roller guide
means (20) in the first coordinate axis (Z), in that the

carrier (23) is deflectable via a flexural pivot (21)
about a first axis of rotation (D1) in the second

coordinate axis (X), in that the carrier (23) is attached
on a bridge (25) via the flexural pivot (21), and this

bridge (25) is attached to the holder (4) via a further
flexural pivot (22), the bridge (25) being deflectable via

this further flexural pivot (22) about a further axis of
rotation (D2) in a third coordinate axis (Y).
Multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 6,
characterised in that the two axes of rotation (D1,D2)

intersect at a common point.
Multi-coordinate feeler head according to claim 7,
characterised in that the point of intersection of the two

axes of rotation (D1,D2) lies on the axis (A) of the
