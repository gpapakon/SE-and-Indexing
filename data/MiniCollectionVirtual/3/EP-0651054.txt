<ABSTRACT>
A virus-inactivated Factor-Xa preparation with at least 100 
units coagulation factor activity per mg protein is described, 

wherein this preparation is produced by activation of a 
corresponding starting material and subsequent treatment for 

the inactivation of infectious agents, particularly viruses. 
By incubation, the preparation obtained in this manner is 

transformed into a stabile beta-Factor Xa preparation. 
In addition, the use of the present preparation for the 

treatment of hemophilia A inhibitor patients is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a virus-inactivated Factor Xa 
preparation, especially to a Factor Xa preparation of high 
purity. A method for the production of this virus-inactivated, 
highly pure Factor Xa preparation is described, wherein this 
method also allows especially a virus-inactivated, highly pure 
beta-Factor Xa preparation to be obtained which is 
distinguished by particular stability. The blood coagulation Factor X represents a plasma glycoprotein 
which is involved in the intrinsic as well as the extrinsic 
blood coagulation cascade. During blood coagulation, Factor X 
is activated to Factor Xa. The latter represents a serine 
protease which catalyses the transformation of prothrombin to 
thrombin. Factor X comprises two subunits, namely a heavy chain with a 
relative molar mass of 49 kD and a light chain with a relative 
molar mass of 17 kD which are connected by a disulfide bridge. 
Through the enzyme-catalysed activation of the zymogen to 
Factor Xa, an amino-terminal peptide with a relative molar mass 
of 11 kD is cleaved from the heavy chain. Through this, alpha-Factor 
Xa with a relative molar mass of approximately 55 kD 
results which represents the proteolytically active Factor Xa 
(J.C. Giddings, Molecular Genetics and Immunoanalysis in Blood 
Coagulation, Weinheim, Cambridge, New York, Basel, Verlag 
Chemie 1988, p. 47ff). Beta-Factor Xa results through further cleavage of a 4.5 kD 
peptide from the carboxy-terminal end of the heavy chain of the 
alpha-Factor Xa. From the literature (J. Biol. Chem., 250: 
4497-4504 (1975) and 249: 5614-5622 (1972)), it follows that 
this concerns an autocatalytic transformation of the alpha-Factor 
Xa into beta-Factor Xa (see also Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 
USA, 72: 3359-3363 (1975)). For this reason, commercially  
 
available Factor Xa preparations contain mixtures of alpha-Factor 
Xa and beta-Factor Xa. The commercially available 
Factor Xa preparations are largely produced through activation 
of Factor X with the aid of Russell's Viper Venom. It is 
known from J. Biol. Chem., 250: 4497-4504 (1975) that this 
enzymatic activation only leads to alpha-Factor Xa. A 
subsequent uncontrolled autocatalytic further transformation to 
beta-Factor Xa follows wherein mixtures of the both forms of 
Factor Xa result. From the literature, it is known that alpha-Factor Xa and beta-Factor 
Xa possess the same enzymatic activities. However, for 
a pharmaceutical preparation, it is of essential importance 
that a Factor Xa product with molecular integrity of the
