<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sanitary 
napkin having side panels. Sanitary napkins comprising a liquid-permeable 
top sheet and a typically liquid-impermeable back sheet 
surrounding an absorbing member are well-known. In 
some instances, such napkins have first and second side 
panels (sometimes referred to as wings) on opposing 
sides. The side panels prevent fluids from flowing out 
of the sanitary napkin when the fluids flow from the 
absorbing member sideways and play a role in preventing 
the undergarment from being stained. In use the side 
panels are folded around the crotch portion of the 
undergarment to help secure the napkin thereto. 
Typically, adhesive segments are provided on the bottom 
sides of the side panels and on the back sheet to 
secure the napkin to the undergarment. 
WO-A-91/16873 discloses sanitary napkins with flap 
bonding means. US-A-4,759,754 discloses a permanent 
bonding of one side panel.  
 Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 60-199446 discloses a sanitary napkin as shown in 
Figures 4 and 5 herein. In this sanitary napkin, both 
side panels 4, 5 have an adhesive segment 6, 7 thereon 
and the back sheet has adhesive segment 11 thereon. 
Each adhesive segment is covered by a release liner 14, 
15, 13. After peeling off release liner 13 from the 
back sheet and securing the napkin to the crotch 
portion of the undergarment, the user peels off release 
liners 14, 15 and secures the side panels to the 
undergarment. During shipping, in some instances, separate 
release liners are applied to each adhesive segment as 
shown in Figures 4 and 5. In some other instances, a 
single release member is used and the side panels are 
folded over the back sheet such that the single release 
member covers the adhesive segments on both side panels 
and on the back sheet.  
 Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 63-186645 discloses a sanitary napkin wherein a 
single release liner covers the various adhesive 
segments. As shown in Figures 6 and 7 herein, release 
liner 13 is used to cover adhesive segments 6 and 7 on 
side panels 4 and 5 as well as adhesive segment 11 on 
the back sheet. Although this format reduces the 
number of release liner segments which are to be 
removed and disposed, the adhesive segments on the side 
panels are left exposed as the napkin is first applied 
to the undergarment and are subject to adherence to 
undesired locations, making application somewhat 
awkward. The present invention provides a sanitary 
napkin that is
