<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an integrated method for the desulfurization and desalting of a fossil fuel, comprising the steps of: (a) contacting a fossil fuel with: (i) a sufficient amount of an aqueous solution capable of depleting the fossil fuel of forms of water soluble salt contaminants; and (ii) an effective amount of a catalyst capable of depleting the fossil fuel of forms of sulfur-bearing organic molecules; (b) incubating the above mixture whereby (i) the fossil fuel is significantly depleted of forms of water soluble salt contaminants; and (ii) the catalytic agent selectively catalyzes carbon-sulfur bonds in sulfur-bearing organic molecules generating a significant amount of water-soluble inorganic sulfur molecules; both reactions occurring without depleting the fossil fuel of combustible organic molecules; and (c) separating the aqueous component from the fossil fuel component, the fossil fuel now being significantly reduced in sulfur and salt contamination and the aqueous component now being significantly enriched with inorganic salts and inorganic sulfur molecules.

<DESCRIPTION>
Salt contaminants in fossil fuels can create 
problems in refinery processes which can be costly to 
rectify. For example, these contaminants can plug 
downstream equipment, can form products that are 
corrosive to refinery equipment, and can interfere with 
chemical processing. Various inorganic salts suspended in fossil fuels, 
such as petroleum, are usually removed by vigorous 
washing with water at the production site and prior to 
refining. There presently are three general approaches 
for the desalting of fossil fuels. All three require 
the contact of the fossil fuel with water. The 
selection of a particular process depends on the type 
of salt dispersion and the properties of the particular 
fossil fuel. For example, simple brine suspensions can 
be removed from fossil fuel by heating under pressure 
sufficient to prevent vapor loss [90-150°C (200-300°F)/3.44-17.2 
bar (50-250 psi)], then allowing the material to 
settle and separate in a large vessel. Alternatively, fresh water can be combined with 
the fossil fuel to form emulsions which solubilize the 
salts from the oil into the water. The aqueous fossil 
fuel emulsion can separate aided by its passage through 
a tower packed with sand, gravel or similar material. 
Emulsions can also be broken by addition of treating 
agents such as soaps, fatty acids, sulfonates, and 
long-chain alcohols. Electrostatic precipitators can 
employ a high potential electric field across a 
settling vessel to coalescence and break emulsions, in  
 
which case dissolved salts and impurities are removed 
with the water. As a result of the physical washing of 
crude oil, the salt concentration in the wash water can 
become quite high and unamendable to biological 
activity. Sulfur contaminants of oil, as well, can be 
problematic. The presence of sulfur has been 
correlated with corrosion of pipeline, pumping, and 
refining equipment, and with premature breakdown of 
combustion engines. Sulfur also poisons many catalysts 
which are used in the refining and combustion of fossil 
fuels. Moreover, the atmospheric emission of sulfur 
combustion products such as sulfur dioxide leads to the 
form of acid deposition known as acid rain. Acid rain 
has lasting deleterious effects on aquatic and forest 
ecosystems, as well as on agricultural areas located 
downwind of combustion facilities. Monticello, D.J. 
and W.R. Finnerty, (1985) Ann. Rev. Microbiol.39:371-389. 
Regulations such as the Clean Air Act of 1964 
require the removal of sulfur, either pre- or post-combustion,
