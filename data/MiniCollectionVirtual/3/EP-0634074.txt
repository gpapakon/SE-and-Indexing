<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for compressing a sequence of digital video images using sync frames is disclosed. The decoder determines a first number representing the actual number of frames already present in the bitstream. A second number representing the desired number of frames in the bitstream is compared to the first number. If the second number exceeds the first number, at least one sync frame is inserted into the bitstream.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COMPRESSING AND DECOMPRESSING A SEQUENCE OF DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGES USING SYNC FRAMESField Of The Invention This invention relates to video signal processing generally and particularly to systems for providing a compressed digital video signal representative of a full color video signal.Background Of The InventionIn real time video systems, compression and decompression are typically done using the same or similar hardware at roughly the same speed. Real time video systems have often required hardware that is too expensive for a single user, or such systems have sacrificed picture quality in favor of lower cost hardware. This problem has been bypassed by the use of presentation level video systems where the compression is performed on expensive hardware, but the decompression is done by low cost hardware. This solution works only in situations where the single-user system needs only to playback compressed video which has been prepared ahead of time.It is an object of the present invention to provide a system for compressing and decompressing real time motion video which may operate on lower cost hardware while maintaining acceptable picture quality.Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description of the invention which follows. 

 Summary Of The Invention A method and apparatus for compressing and decompressing a sequence of digital video images using sync frames is disclosed. The encoder determines a first number representing the actual number of frames already present in the bitstream. A second number representing the desired number of frames in the bitstream is compared to the first number. If the second number exceeds the first number, at least one sync frame is inserted into the bitstream.Brief Description Of The DrawingsFigure 1 is a flow diagram illustrating the operation of a decoder according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.Figure 2A shows the use of a corresponding previous pixel to perform intra-frame decoding in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.Figure 2B shows the use of a corresponding previous pixel to perform inter-frame decoding in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the operation of an encoder according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.Figure 3A is a flow diagram illustrating the vector quantization and run-length encoding procedures of the encoder of Figure 3.

<CLAIMS>
 What is claimed is:
1. A method for compressing a sequence of digital video images comprising the steps of:
(A) determining a first number representing the actual number of frames already in a bitstream;
(B) comparing said first number to a second number, wherein said second number represents a desired number of frames in said bitstream;
(C) if said second number exceeds said first number, inserting at least one sync frame into said bitstream.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein step (C) further comprises the steps of:
(i) subtracting said second number from said first number to determine a third number; and
(ii) inserting said third number of sync frames into said bitstream.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said bitstream represents a portion of said sequence of digital video images.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein said first number is determined by monitoring said bitstream over a predetermined interval of time.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein said second number represents the desired number of frames in said bitstream over said predetermined interval of time. 


 6. The method of claim 1, wherein said at least one sync frame represents the same amount of time in said bitstream as a normal compressed frame.
7. An apparatus for compressing a sequence of digital video images comprising:
(A) means for determining a first number representing the actual number of frames already in a bitstream;
(B) means for comparing said first number to a second number, wherein said second number represents a desired number of frames in said bitstream;
(C) means for inserting at least one sync frame into said bitstream if said second number exceeds said first number.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein said means for inserting at least one sync frame further comprises:
(i) means for subtracting said second number from said first number to determine a third number; and
(ii) means for inserting said third number of sync frames into said bitstream.
9. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein said bitstream represents a portion of said sequence of digital video images.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein said means for determining said first number comprises means for monitoring said bitstream over a predetermined interval of time. 


 11. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein said second number represents the desired number of frames in said bitstream over said predetermined interval of time.
12. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein said at least one sync frame represents the same amount of time in said bitstream as a normal compressed frame.
13. A method for decompressing a bitstream representative of a sequence of digital video images, comprising the steps of:
(A) selecting a frame from said bitstream for decoding;
(B) determining whether said selected frame is a sync frame; and
(C) if said selected frame is a sync frame, copying a previously decoded frame into a current image bitmap.
14. An apparatus for decompressing a bitstream representative of a sequence of digital video images, comprising;
(A) means for selecting a frame from said bitstream for decoding;
(B) means for determining whether said selected frame is a sync frame; and
(C) means for copying a previously decoded frame into a current image bitmap if said selected frame is a sync frame.
