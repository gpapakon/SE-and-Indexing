<ABSTRACT>
In a low-energy neutral particle beam generating 
apparatus having a main discharge chamber (13), a high-density 

electron beam generated in an electron beam generating 
unit (10) is introduced into a main discharge chamber where 

it is diverged by a positive voltage applied to an anode 
electrode (16) and a multipolar magnetic field formed by a 

permanent magnet (17), a main discharge gas introduced into 
the main discharge chamber is ionized by collision with 

the diverged electron beam, thereby generating a uniform 
plasma in the main discharge chamber, low-energy ions are 

drawn out from the plasma and electrically neutralized 
by a perforated electrode (18) having a multiplicity of holes, 

thereby obtaining a low-energy neutral particle beam of 
large diameter without the need of using a complicated, 

large-sized apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and 
apparatus for generating a low-energy neutral particle beam. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a method 
and apparatus capable of generating a low-energy neutral 
particle beam which has a large diameter, low energy and a 
velocity higher than thermal velocity and in which neutral 
particles are uniform in direction. There has heretofore been proposed a neutral particle 
beam generating technique wherein a saddle electric field is 
formed by using DC electric discharge, and a gas is ionized 
to produce ions by using the oscillation of electrons in the 
electric field, thereby generating a neutral particle beam 
through charge exchange and recombination with electrons. 
Such a neutral particle beam generating technique is, for 
example, shown in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 
183900/86. There has also been developed a neutral particle 
beam generating apparatus capable of raising the discharge 
efficiency and sustaining the electric discharge at low gas 
pressure by using PIG (Penning Ionization Gauge) electric 
discharge. However, the above-described conventional neutral 
particle beam generating technique and apparatus suffer 
from various problems. For example, the discharge 
sustaining voltage is relatively high, so that the interior 
of a neutral particle beam source and a container may be 
contaminated by sputtering of an electrode constituting 
material. As the discharge voltage is lowered, the neutral 
particle beam density decreases and therefore, when it is 
intended to generate a neutral particle beam having a large 
diameter, the electric discharge becomes unstable. There is also a method of forming a neutral 
particle beam by jetting out heated gas molecules from 
a nozzle unlike the above-described neutral particle beam  
 
generating technique and apparatus. However, this method 
has disadvantages in that since gas molecules are heated, 
reaction of the furnace material with the gas molecules 
gives rise to a serious problem, and that it is difficult 
to obtain a neutral particle beam having a large diameter. Further, a neutral particle beam generating apparatus 
using ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) electric discharge 
that utilizes resonance of a microwave and a magnetic 
field has recently been proposed. This apparatus suffers, 
however, from some problems. Namely since ECR electric 
discharge requires a high magnetic field intensity, the 
apparatus becomes large in size. Further, it is necessary 
in order
