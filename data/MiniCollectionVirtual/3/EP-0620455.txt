<ABSTRACT>
An ophthalmic lens, particularly a soft hydrogel 
contact lens, is disclosed. The lens can be derived from 

a crosslinked polymer made by reacting a hydrophilic 
monomer with a crosslinking amount of a polyfunctional 

compound containing a saccharide residue. The preferred 
hydrophilic monomer is actually a mixture of the following 

individual hydrophilic monomers: a) the reaction product 
of a free radical reactive monoisocyanate and a monoalkoxy 

polyalkylether, b) N,N-dimethylacrylamide, and optionally 
c)hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The preferred polyfunctional 

compound is a prepolymer derived from an alkoxylated 
glucose or sucrose. This prepolymer can be made by 

reacting glucose or sucrose, which has been ethoxylated or 
propoxylated, with a free radical reactive isocyanate 

which has been capped. The free radical reactive 
isocyanate can be capped by reacting it with a 

polyalkylether, such as polyethylene glycol, and then 
reacting this intermediate with a diisocyanate. 
Advantageously, a fluorinated monomer is added to the 
reactive components from which the crosslinked polymer of 

the lens is derived. The preferred fluoromonomer is 
composed of the reaction product of a free radical 

reactive monoisocyanate and perfluorooctanol. 
The polymerization is ideally carried out in the 
presence of an inert diluent, preferably the boric acid 

ester of polyethylene glycol 400.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a crosslinked polymer
derived from the polymerization of a hydrophilic monomer
and a crosslinking agent. More specifically, it relates
to such a polymer which has the properties desired for
ophthalmic lenses, particularly soft hydrogel contact
lenses.Soft hydrogel contact lenses are currently the lens
design of choice for extended wear applications. These
lenses are derived from the polymerization of a
hydrophilic monomer such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate
(HEMA). Other hydrophilic monomers can be used, such as
N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and N-vinyl pyrrolidone
(NVP), although these alternative monomers have not yet
found as wide-spread an acceptance as HEMA for the
fabrication of commercially viable contact lenses for
daily or extended wear applications.A contact lens composed of the polymerization
reaction product of HEMA (polyHEMA) is swollen in water to
prepare a hydrogel. For higher water-containing
hydrogels, the water content of the hydrogel lens is an
important factor in patient comfort because the
permeability of oxygen through the lens is dependent on
its water content. Since the corneal tissue of the eye of 
a contact lens wearer needs oxygen to "breathe", the water
content of the lens, and hence its oxygen permeability,
are important factors in achieving an acceptable degree of
wearer comfort and corneal health.Although polyHEMA lenses can be swollen with water to
prepare hydrogels with minimally acceptable water contents
and oxygen permeability, such lenses composed of polyHEMA
alone do not exhibit sufficient mechanical properties for
routine handling and care. Accordingly, commercially
available contact lenses are derived from polymerizing not
only HEMA, but also a crosslinking monomer to enhance the
mechanical properties of the finished lens. The
crosslinking monomer conventionally used is ethylene
glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). While the crosslinking
monomer improves the mechanical properties of the finished
lens, and therefore enhances the handleability of the
lens, it also has adverse consequences. High levels of
conventional crosslinking agents serve to reduce the water
content of the finished lens and increase its brittleness.
The reduced water content lowers the permeability of
oxygen through the lens, which in turn decreases patient
comfort and corneal health over an extended period of
wear. The increase in brittleness of the lens makes the
lens more fragile, and therefore more susceptible to
tearing.Since neither polyHEMA alone nor the reaction product
