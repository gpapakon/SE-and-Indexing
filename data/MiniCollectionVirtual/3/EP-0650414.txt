<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED TIRE SIDEWALL COMPOSITIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to tire sidewall compositions which exhibit improved ozone resistance and fatigue crack propagation resistance, as well as good sidewall adhesion to the tire carcass and good heat build-up.2. Description of Information DisclosuresRubber tires, such as pneumatic tires, include many components, such as, for example, sidewalls, which may be decorative and may have incorporated therein a titanium dioxide pigment. Sidewalls are continuously subjected to distortion under the normal road operating conditions, and the sidewalls are subjected to extensive continuous flexing and can crack under such flexing conditions. In addition to such flex cracking, such sidewalls are also subjected to atmospheric chemical action such as by ozone attack. The overall effect is that the sidewalls may erode and degrade and can even separate from the tire carcass during use and can cause the tire to fail.Generally, the current practice in the manufacture of black sidewalls is to add chemical protectants to general purpose rubbers in an attempt to minimize ozone and flex cracking but they tend to be fugative and staining in the case of contact with white sidewalls 

combination. In some cases, and in particular white sidewalls, polymer blends have been used to effect improvement in ozone and flex resistance.A composition which attempts to overcome these problems is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,508,595 to Wilson, and assigned to the General Tire & Rubber Company. This patent discloses a blend of chlorobutyl rubber, natural rubber, and ethylene propylene terpolymer as the protective cover for the white sidewalls used in such pneumatic tire construction.U.S. Patent No. 3,630,974 to Ladocsi, et al., assigned to Exxon Research and Engineering Company, further discloses the use of terpolymers for blending into high unsaturation rubbers in order to enhance their static .ozone resistance. This patent also discloses a triblend of halobutyl rubber along with a terpolymer and a high-unsaturation rubber to improve dynamic ozone resistance and heat flex resistance. The terpolymers employed by this patentee comprise ethylene, propylene and a diene, and the high unsaturation rubber can include natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, and polybutadiene rubber, etc. It is again noted that various fillers can be used in these compositions, and among the variety of materials listed are various "oils" along with resins, waxes, etc.
