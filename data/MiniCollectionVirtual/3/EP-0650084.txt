<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns silver halide
photographic emulsions and particularly silver halide
grains of the core/shell type, and a process for obtaining
these grains and the corresponding photographic emulsions.The process for forming the photographic image in
silver halides comprises a stage of forming a latent
image. At the time of exposure, electrons are produced
and these electrons migrate in the grain and are trapped
at specific sites where the latent image is formed. In
ordinary, non-sensitised, silver halide grains, dispersion
of the sites promotes a faster subsequent development but
enables only low sensitivity levels to be achieved. The
purpose of the sensitisation is to concentrate these sites
in order to increase sensitivity. However, in doing this,
the development speed is reduced.Means have therefore been sought for improving the
concentration and localisation of the latent image sites
in silver halide grains. These means in the prior art
consist of using compounds which are absorbed selectively
on certain sites in the grains, introducing distortions in
the grain or in the crystalline morphology of the grains,
as is described in European patent 96 726 or US patent 5
045 443, modifying the grains by epitaxy, as is described
in European patent 462 581, or again producing grains with
a complex crystalline form, as is described in US patent 4
710 455. None of these different means is entirely
satisfactory. European patent 523,464 discloses a silver
halide photographic emulsion comprising silver halide
grains having a cubic crystal lattice structure, and
comprising at least {1,1,1} and/or at least {1,0,0} crystal
face having at least one cracked or hollow zone, around
which silver halide protrusions from at least one crater
and/or at least one hopper structure on at least one
crystal face of said silver halide grains The present invention relates to silver halide grains
with a sensitivity which is improved because of the better
concentration of the latent image sites, resulting from
the particular morphology of these grains, and a process
for obtaining these grains.The process according to the invention comprises the
following stages:
(a) silver bromide or silver bromoiodide grains are formed
in a colloidal dispersion medium (such as a aqueous
solution of gelatin); it is possible to proceed by
nucleation from silver bromide nuclei or silver
bromoiodide nuclei, at a pAg of between approximately 8.5
and 9.5 , a temperature of between 40 and 70°C and a pH of
between 5.0 and 7.0,(b) growth of

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing cubic or cubo-octahedral
core/shell silver halide grains, sensitive to radiation,

characterised in that it comprises the following stages:

(a) forming silver bromide grains or silver bromoiodide
grains with a bulk iodide content of between 2 and 15 mole

percent based on silver, in a colloidal dispersion medium,
by nucleation from silver bromide nuclei or silver

bromoiodide nuclei, at a pAg of between 8.5 and 9.5, a
temperature of between 40 and 70°C and a pH of between 5.0

and 7.0;
(b) during a growth stage, maintaining the conditions of
stage (a) until core grains with a mean diameter of

between 0.1 and 2.0 µm are obtained;
(c) modifying the growth environment of the core grains,
by successively adjusting the pAg to a value between 7.5

and 8.0 and then to a value between 7.5 and 6.0,
maintaining the temperature at approximately 60°C;
(d) effecting the growth of a silver chlorobromide shell
on the core grains by precipitating the silver

chlorobromide in two successive stages, the first at an
accelerated rate, the second at a constant rate,

maintaining the pAg at a value between 7.0 and 7.5, at a
temperature of between 50 and 80°C, and a pH of between

5.0 and 7.0, so as to achieve a preferential growth of
silver chlorobromide on the ridges adjacent to the faces

(100) of the silver halide grains and continuing this
growth to the point where a cavity has been formed in the

central region of the said faces (100).
