<ABSTRACT>
A refrigeration system (10) which controls the 
temperature of a conditioned space (12) to a predetermined 

temperature range adjacent to a selected set point temperature 
(SP) via a cooling cycle which includes evaporation a 

cryogen, such as CO₂ or N₂, in a heat exchanger (44). In an 
apparatus embodiment, a controller (66) determines a 

desired evaporation vapor pressure value (EPX) of the 
cryogen as a function of the selected set point temperature 

(SP), and then controls (EPV) the evaporation pressure (EP) 
in the heat exchanger means as a function of the determined 

desired evaporating vapor pressure value. The controller 
further determines a desired superheat value (SHX) of the 

cryogen exiting the heat exchanger means as a function of 
the selected set point temperature (SP), and controls (FCV) 

the mass flow rate of liquid cryogen evaporating in the 
heat exchanger as a function of the determined desired 

superheat value. A method embodiment includes the steps of 
providing (178,179) a desired evaporation vapor pressure 

value (EPX) of the cryogen as a function of the selected 
set point temperature (SP), controlling (180-196) the 

evaporation pressure in the heat exchanger means as a 
function of the desired evaporation vapor pressure value, 

providing (208,179) a desired superheat value (SHX) of the 
cryogen exiting the heat exchanger means as a function of 

the selected set point temperature (SP), and controlling 
(202-216) the mass flow rate of liquid cryogen from the

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to air conditioning
and refrigeration systems, and more specifically to
stationary and transport air conditioning and refrigeration
systems which utilize a cryogen.Transport refrigeration systems condition the air
of a refrigerated space of a vehicle, hereinafter called
the "conditioned space", such as a straight truck, the
trailer of a tractor-trailer combination, a refrigerated
container, and the like, with the air of the conditioned
space being controlled to a narrow temperature range around
or adjacent to a predetermined set point temperature. Such
systems conventionally utilize a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)
refrigerant in a mechanical refrigeration cycle. The
mechanical refrigeration cycle requires a refrigerant
compressor driven by a prime mover, which often includes a
dedicated internal combustion engine, such as a diesel
engine. Because of the suspected depleting effect of CFC's
on stratospheric ozone (O3), and the detrimental effects of
diesel emissions, practical alternatives to the use of
CFC's are being sought.The use of a cryogen, ie., a gas which has been
compressed to a very cold liquid state, such as carbon
dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2), in a transport refrigeration
system is particularly attractive because, in addition 
to eliminating the need for a CFC, it also eliminates the
need to transport a compressor and associated prime mover.US-A-4 186 562 discloses a refrigeration system and a method of operating the same in accordance with the preamble of claims 7 and 1, respectively.It would be desirable, and it is an object of the
present invention, to provide new and improved cryogenic
based air conditioning and refrigeration systems, suitable
for both transport and stationary applications, which more
effectively and efficiently utilize the cryogen, for
improved temperature control of a conditioned space, as
well as for lower cost operation. The term "refrigeration
system" will be hereinafter used to generically cover both
air conditioning and refrigeration applications, transport
and stationary.Cryogens in a liquid state may be delivered to the
refrigeration system at much colder temperatures than
temperatures associated with fresh loads, such as lettuce,
for example. Thus, it would be desirable, and it is
another object of the invention, to provide a refrigeration
system utilizing a cryogen which effectively conditions a
space containing a fresh load, while minimizing the chance
for spot freezing, without compromising the ability of the
system to
