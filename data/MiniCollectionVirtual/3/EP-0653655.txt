<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a focus detection 
apparatus for a camera, having a plurality of distance 

measurement points, for detecting focus states at the 
respective distance measurement points. 
In the apparatus of this type, this invention 
provides a focus detection apparatus wherein as a 

condition for projecting auxiliary light in a 
low-contract state, projection/non-projection of the 

auxiliary light is determined only on the basis of an 
optical state of a central one of the distance 

measurement points of the frame, and optimal focusing 
can be performed for a principal object such as a 

person.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a focus adjusting
apparatus for a camera or the like, having an auxiliary
light source for illuminating an object to be
photographed, for performing focus detection of plural
object areas within a frame of a photographic lens.In a conventional focus detection apparatus for a
camera, the following method of detecting a defocus
amount of an object is known well. Light beams emitted
from an object and passing through different exit pupil
areas of a photographic lens are focused on a pair of
line sensors, and a relative positional displacement
between a pair of image signals obtained by
photoelectrically converting an object image is
obtained, thereby detecting the defocus amount of the
object.In the above method, since a pair of focus
detection systems (optical systems and sensors) are
used, only a defocus amount in one object area within
the frame is detected. However, various methods are
proposed wherein a plurality of detection systems are
prepared to detect defocus amounts of plural object
areas within the frame. Even if plural object areas are subjected to focus
detection, the number of object areas to be finally
focused in a camera is one or two (in the later case,
the photographic lens is operated to an intermediate
focus position which covers, e.g., two areas in terms
of the depth of field), an object area is selected in
accordance with a given technique, and focusing of the
photographic lens is performed by the defocus amount of
the selected area.Area selection is generally performed by a method
in which an object area nearest to the camera is
selected.In this conventional focus detection apparatus, a
defocus amount cannot be detected when the object has a
low brightness level or when there is no change in
brightness (reflectance) on a surface of an object even
if the object brightness level is not low. For this
reason, an auxiliary illumination unit is often used to
illuminate the object in a focus undetectable state.When plural focus detection object areas are
present, it is convenient to arrange the illumination
unit to illuminate these plural object areas.In the conventional arrangement, however, the
following problems are posed when focus detection of
the plural object areas is performed using an
illumination unit. If a condition for operating the illumination unit
is given such that all object areas must be focus
undetectable, the illumination unit is not operated
even if one object area is focus detectable. For
example, in a bright background with a person

<CLAIMS>
A focus adjusting apparatus comprising:

a) a sensor circuit (SNS-1 to SNS-4) having a plurality of
sensor parts each of which independently receives a light from

a different area (RGN1 to RGN4) of the scene and detects a
focus state of the respective area;
b) a focus adjusting circuit (PRS) for selecting a sensor
part from said plurality of the sensor parts and for performing

a focus adjustment based on the selected sensor part;

predetermined sensor part (SNS4a, 4b; RGN4) when auxiliary

light is projected in a predetermined illumination pattern,
said predetermined sensor part being not in a suited light
receiving position with respect to the illumination pattern of 

the auxiliary light to perform proper the focus detection with
auxiliary light.

characterized in
that
said plurality of sensor parts include a sensor part
(SNS-1) which is arranged so as to be substantially

perpendicular to the illumination pattern of the auxiliary
light and includes a sensor part (SNS-4) which is arranged so

as to be substantially in the same direction as the
illumination pattern, and said inhibition circuit inhibits the

selection of the sensor part (SNS-4) which is arranged in the
same direction as the illumination pattern.
