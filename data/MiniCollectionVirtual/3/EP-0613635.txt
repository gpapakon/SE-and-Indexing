<ABSTRACT>
In a brush, in particular a mascara brush, dental brush or medical cleaning and application brush, a plurality of bristles (2) being fixed between two twisted wires (1) and extending away towards all sides from these twisted wires (1), and the wires (1) being enclosed by a plastic covering, to achieve a higher absorption capacity for liquid, provision is made for the plastic casing to consist of an absorbent, in particular open-pore, foamed material (4). Furthermore, provision may be made for the foamed material casing (4) to be greatly roughened or frayed in such a way that the bristles (2) are formed by the roughening or fraying.

segments (1) and extending to all sides away from these twisted wire segments 
(1), and the wire segments (1) being surrounded by a plastic coating, 


characterized in that
 the plastic coating consists of a liquid absorbent, in 
particular open-cell, foamed material (4). 
Brush according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the foamed coating (4) 
has a wall thickness of between 0.1 and 1.5 mm. 
Brush according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the foamed coating (4) 
has an extensibility of between 400 and 500 %. 
Brush according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the foamed coating (4) 
has a ppi count of between 5 and 150. 
Brush according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the wire segments (1) 
are coated by a foamed material of a very high ppi count, count of 

pores/cm, e.g. 100 pores/2.5 cm. 
Brush according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
, during the coating of 
the wire segments (1) or after the twisting of the coated wire segments (1), 

the foamed material (4) is mechanically or chemically roughened to form 
fibrous fringes (5).
