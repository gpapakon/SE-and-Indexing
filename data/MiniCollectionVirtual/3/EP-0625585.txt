<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an Fe-Cr-Al alloy 
foil having high oxidation resistance at elevated 
temperatures, which is suitable for a substrate of 
catalytic converter. Catalytic converters are used to remove harmful 
elements, such as NOx, CO or HC, generated by burning 
fossil fuel. Various types of catalytic converters are 
used in automobiles. Of such converters, converters 
composed of a honeycomb-structure made from an Fe-Cr-Al 
alloy foil have come to be widely used, because they have 
many advantages, such as reducing pressure loss. A catalytic converter made from an Fe-Cr-Al alloy 
foil is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 
4,318,828. This publication proposes that Cr is 15 to 25 
wt.%, Al 3 to 6 wt.%, and Y 0.3 to 1.0 wt.%. However, 
since Y is a rare metal and expensive, alloy foils 
containing it becomes very expensive, so that it is 
difficult to use these foils in a common automobile from 
an economical point of view. On the other hand, it has been proposed in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,414,023 that Cr: 8 to 25 wt.%, Al: 3 to 8  
 
wt.%, and rare-earth elements: 0.002 to 0.06 wt.% be used. 
In this publication, rare earth elements (in particular, 
Ce and La), which are cheaper than Y, are used in place of 
Y. Rare-earth elements are added to improve the adhesion 
of surface oxide to metal. It is described that these 
rare-earth elements should not be added in an amount in 
excess of 0.06 wt.% because they degrade the hot 
workability of alloys. This alloy is less expensive than 
the alloy foil of the above-described U.S. Patent No. 
4,318,828. However, it encounters a problem in that it 
has inferior oxidation resistance. It is a matter of 
course that the oxidation resistance is more important 
property for a foil used in a catalytic converter. In connection with this, when the inventors of the 
present invention examined in detail the influence of 
rare-earth elements, in particular La, Nd and Ce on the 
oxidation resistance and the hot workability of the alloy, 
they found that when about 0.05 or more wt.% of La and Nd 
are added, the oxidation resistance is improved to such an 
extent that it is comparable to alloy foils containing Y, 
and found that Ce should be removed as much as possible 
because Ce is the main factor resulting in degradation of 
hot workability of alloy. Using these results, the inventors of the present 
invention proposed in U.S. Patent No. 4,904,540 an alloy 
to which La is added, and in U.S. Patent No. 5,228,932, an 
alloy to which Nd is added. Further,
