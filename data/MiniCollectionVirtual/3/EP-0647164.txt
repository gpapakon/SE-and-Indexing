<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optimization of the control actions "c" via control members for the work rolls during flatness control of strip and comprises a method for evaluation of the control actions and an evaluation device which constitutes an integral part of the control equipment. The control actions are obtained by solution of the relationship c = (ATA)-1.AT . f = B . f, wherein A is a matrix which describes the stress distribution which arises across the strip when the different control members are activated and wherein "f" is a vector which contains the flatness errors obtained after measurement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The flatness of a rolled product is determined, inter alia, 
by the work rolls of the rolling mill, and the flatness can 
thereby be influenced by the setting of the different control 
members of the rolls which may comprise screws, bending 
cylinders, shifting devices, etc. The present invention 
relates to a method and a device for evaluation of the input 
signals to the control devices of the control members which 
are needed to influence the flatness such that the desired 
accuracy with regard to flatness is attained. The control members which are included in a rolling mill 
influence the flatness of the strip in different ways. The 
screws of the rolling mill are used for setting the roll gap 
across the strip or for adjustment or intentional angular 
adjustment of the roll gap. Normally bending cylinders are 
provided, both for bending of the work rolls and for bending 
of intermediate rolls in a 6-high rolling mill. Normally, 
also so-called shifting devices are included for axial 
shifting of the rolls. A condition for achieving the desired flatness of the rolled 
product is to have a more or less continuous access to a 
measure of actual flatness across the strip, that is, a 
flatness curve. With a known flatness curve, the rolling 
mill can be provided with a closed-loop flatness control. In 
a classical manner, the flatness curve obtained is compared 
with the desired flatness. The flatness errors which thereby 
arise are then used, in accordance with different models, 
for influencing the control members to minimize the flatness 
errors. Thus, the flatness control comprises several executing 
devices, which means a relatively extensive evaluation  
 
process to decide on the magnitude of the various actions by 
the control members which provide the best result. A very suitable measurement device - which is often used in 
these applications - for determining the flatness curve of 
the rolled strip is the "STRESSOMETER", developed by Asea 
Brown Boveri AB, which has been available on the market 
since the middle of the 60's and which has been described in 
a large number of pamphlets and other publications. The 
measurement device is designed as a measuring roll, with 
approximately 50 measuring points across the strip, which in 
most cases can be placed between the mill stand and the 
wind-up reel without the use of deflector rolls. The 
measurement takes place with the aid of force transducers, 
based on the magnetoelastic principle, and primarily 
provides the stress distribution of the
