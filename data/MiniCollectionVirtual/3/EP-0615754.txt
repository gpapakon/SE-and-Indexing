<ABSTRACT>
Flupirtine-containing pharmaceutical compositions with controlled release of active substance using a release-slowing component, where 0.001 to 20 parts of release-slowing component are present for one part by weight of flupirtine (as base) and the flupirtine can also be in the form of its physiologically tolerated salts, and the flupirtine release rate is between 5 and 300 mg per hour, where appropriate with the addition of a rapid-release proportion of flupirtine or one of its salts.
