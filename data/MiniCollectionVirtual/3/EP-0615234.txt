<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are liquid-crystalline and infrared-sensitive liquid-crystalline 
polyesters for optical data storage, processes for the 

preparation of the same, and an apparatus comprising an infrared-sensitive 
liquid-crystalline polyester. Owing to covalently bonded dye 

the liquid crystalline polyester is infrared sensitive and high 
concentrations of dye are obtainable, without having detrimental 

effects on the properties of the liquid-crystalline polyester. This 
results in a highly sensitive liquid-crystalline polyester for optical 

data storage. Infrared dyes which are preferably bonded in liquid-crystalline 
polyester are croconium, squarilium, azo, and azamethine 

dyes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of liquid-crystalline polyesters 
suitable for use in optical data processing, more particularly liquid-crystalline 
polyesters which are infrared-sensitive due to the 
presence of an infrared-absorbing dye. Liquid-crystalline polymeric compositions containing infrared-absorbing 
dye are known from the literature. Such polymeric 
compositions, including polyesters, are described in EP-A-0 302 497. 
Information can be written in such polymeric compositions with the use 
of a solid-state laser (λ = 750 to 870 nanometers). The infrared-absorbing 
dye serves to convert the laser light energy into thermal 
energy. According to the above-mentioned publication, information is 
written in films of liquid-crystalline polymers in the following 
manner. Using a laser the film, which has been aligned in advance, 
with for instance an electric field, and so consists of one domain 
and is hence transparent, is heated locally to above a phase 
transition temperature and then rapidly cooled. As a result of the 
rapid cooling the heated section of the liquid-crystalline layer is 
not restored to its original transparent state but remains light-scattering, 
i.e., opaque. In this way opaque lines can be written in a 
transparent film. Writing transparent lines in an opaque film is also known from other 
publications. In those cases an unaligned film is employed, which is 
heated locally with a laser. During the irradiation with the laser an 
electric or magnetic field is applied, the heated section of the film 
thus being aligned and hence rendered transparent. (Cf., e.g., 
GB-A-2 146 787).  When writing data the thing is to have the highest possible 
concentration of dye in the polymeric composition without, of course, 
said composition's properties being adversely affected. The drawback 
to the above-mentioned polymeric composition is that the infrared-absorbing 
dye is mixed in with the polymer, to form so-called solid 
solutions. As a rule only low concentrations of dye can be dissolved 
in these polymers, since otherwise there will be crystallisation or 
segregation of the dyes, especially on the long term. Moreover, in the 
case of solid solution polymers it is often hard to make optically 
transparent films with homogeneous dye distribution. Also, liquid-crystal polymers are known in which the dye is 
incorporated into the polymer chain. For instance, in DE-OS 3 603 267 
dye is incorporated into the polymer chain to adapt the absorption 
behaviour of liquid-crystalline polymers to the
