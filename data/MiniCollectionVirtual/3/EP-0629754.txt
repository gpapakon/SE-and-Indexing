<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a building-wall cladding having a multiplicity of plate-like panels (10) which can be lined up in rows one against the other and consists of a sheet-metal-like material whose region which runs essentially parallel to the building wall is arranged at a distance therefrom and is designed as a retaining region (21) for facing blocks (23) or tiles and is provided with perforation arrangements (22). The facing blocks (23) or tiles (31) are provided, on their side which, in the mounted state, faces the retaining region (21), with protrusions which can be plugged into the perforations of the perforation arrangements (22) and are of a corresponding shape. As a result, the retaining region (21) may be provided with the perforation arrangements (22) during production, and the facing blocks (23) can then be plugged in. The panels (10) produced in this manner can then be mounted on a building wall in a simple manner, complex fitting of the facing blocks on the building site being dispensed with. Nevertheless, such panels (1) have the natural appearance of a natural-stone exterior wall.
