<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water heater and is used to further improve insulation, corrosion protection, efficiency and reduction of weight, environmental pollution and manufacturing cost. The insulation is arranged as a self-supporting shell (3) around the base body (1) and at a distance therefrom. Fresh air is forced through the interspace. The seal (15) of the door (19) is tightened by a clamping sleeve (16) with separate clamping elements and is thus uncoupled from the door to a very large extent. A baffle plate (24) in the water space has the return water flowing over it in an injector-like manner. The cross-section of the pipes (30) is flattened in certain portions, as a result of which and in conjunction with fittings a thorough mixing takes place. A plurality of pipes (30) are assigned their own fuel-supplying devices (38). In certain portions, the pipes (30) are equipped with devices for promoting the combustion, heat transmission and protection against destruction. The controlling of the number of fuel-supplying devices in operation and the associated fan output for the air supply is effected by a computer (40), which is connected to at least one device (39) for measuring the pollutants in the flue gas and initiates a minimization of the pollutant emission.
