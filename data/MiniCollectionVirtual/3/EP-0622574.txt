<ABSTRACT>
A rotary actuator (11) for valves with a rotatable valve element comprises a pneumatic piston (19) which is pushed into its end postion, the position corresponding to the closed position of the valve, by springs (39). Two groups of roller tappets (26, 27) which run in guides (28, 30) arranged immediately parallel to one another are mounted on a piston stem (23). One guide (28) is fixed to the housing and parallel to the axis while the other guide (30) is provided with the output shaft (34). The cam guide (30) is linear in the range of opening and designed with a large adjustment angle while, in the direction of the closed position, it has a decreasing adjustment angle and transmission ratio and hence generates a higher torque. A torsional elasticity in the region of the rotary actuator creates an elasticity reserve which can compensate for differences in the exact closed position of the valve.

Actuating device for a rotary closure body (36) of a valve (12), particularly
a butterfly valve, with a piston (19) pneumatically actuatable on at

least one side and which is axially movable and by means of a curved guide
(30) and dogs (26) said axial movement can be transformed into a rotary

movement of a driven shaft (34) couplable to a shaft of the closure body
(36), in which in its development the curved guide (30) in its portion (46)

associated with the valve closed position is continuously curved in the direction
of a reduction of an angle (a, b) between at least one of its guide

faces (40) and a parallel (20a) to the piston axis (20), characterized in
that the development of the guide face (40) passes from a linearly directed

linear portion (43) emanating from the vicinity of the open position of the
valve (12), via a more curved intermediate portion (44) into a less curved

curved portion (46) of the curved face (40) and that a spring tension (39)
pressing the piston (19) into its end position is provided.
Actuating device according to claim 1, characterized in that the curves
are arcuate curves.
Actuating device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
curved guide (30) has a curved face (40, 41) each associated with the open

or closed position and which have a differing curve configuration.
Actuating device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the curved guide (30) is provided in the wall (32) of a rotary

element (31), which has on one side the driven shaft (34) and is replaceably
located in the actuating device (11).
Actuating device according to claim 4, characterized in that the rotary
element (31) is mounted in rotary manner in a front end (17) of the actuating

device (11) and is removable after releasing a fastening ring (38).
Actuating device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the curved guide (30) is located within an in particular sleeve-like

guide part (29) fixed to the actuating device (11) and preferably provided 
on a cover (17) of the pneumatic cylinder and which has a guideway (28)

substantially parallel to the cylinder axis (20), and that dogs (26, 27),
particularly rolls, fitted to the piston (19), cooperate with the curved

guide (30) and guideway (28).
Actuating device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
by torsionally elastic means in the rotary drive of the closure body (36).
Actuating device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that at least one curved face (40, 41) of the curved guide (30) and/or a

guideway (28) are circumferentially elastically resiliently constructed.
Actuating device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the curved guide (30) and/or a guideway are constructed with at

least two slots penetrating the wall (32, 29) of a sleeve, the wall portions
between the slots being elastically resilient and preferably the slots are

open to an end face (33) of the sleeve.
Actuating device according to one of the claims 7 to 9, characterized
in that the torsional elasticity is provided at least in the area associated

with the valve closed position and/or increases in the direction of said
area.
