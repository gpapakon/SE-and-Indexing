<ABSTRACT>
A multistage ejector pump has a ring-shaped flow channel (22) designed for an outwardly directed throughflow in the radial direction. In at least one of the two opposite approximately disk-shaped or annular disk-shaped wall parts mutually spaced apart by an axial gap are provided mutually concentric passageways (22D) for the fluid substance which communicate with a suction chamber (15 to 18). The concentric parts of the wall located between the passageways form an ejector disk (1), as well as ejector rings (2 to 5), whose cross-sectional shapes and surface profiles are adaptable to obtain favorable flow conditions in the flow channel for each pumping operation. Additional flow guiding profiles (37 to 40) inserted into the flow channel (22) and consisting of one or several adjacent and/or successive profiles reduce on the one hand the turbulence resulting from the mixture of the substance to be conveyed with the pump fluid and consequent damages to subsequent pump stages, and on the other hand reduce the residual energy of the pump fluid.
