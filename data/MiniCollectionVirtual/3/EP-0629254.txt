<DESCRIPTION>
 STRUCTURAL SIDING COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF PREPAIRING THIS COMPOSITIONThe present invention relates to the field of building construction products. More particularly, the present invention relates to a structural siding composition useful in the building industry for constructing side walls for dwellings and certain commercial buildings.The building industry currently employs a time-consuming and inefficient method of constructing exterior walls for residential and certain commercial buildings. Usually side walls are constructed by building a frame using lumber, nominally 2"x 4" in dimension, and o then attaching one or more let-in braces across the upright frame components ("studs"), which have been spaced usually at between 16 or 24 inch intervals, to improve racking strength and therefore dimensional stability, particularly at corners. Alternatively, a sheet of plywood, . oriented strandboard, or other material is attached to the 2"x 4" frame studs at the corners to provide the necessary racking strength. Insulation, e g., glass fiber batts or foamed polymeric 5 panels, may be applied between the 2"x 4" frame components and then a vapor barrier consisting of a sheet of polyethylene or the like may be applied surrounding the exposed insulation surfaces. Next a "sheathing", such as a foamed polymeric material, cellulosic board, or oriented strandboard, is applied exterior to the outer vapor barrier (which is commonly called the "weather barrier") and then siding of some type (e.g., wooden clapboard, iapboard, 0 or shingles, or profiled vinyl or aluminum siding, etc.) is applied on the outermost surface. Sheetrock may then be applied on the inner surface of the construction to finish the interior walls. Thus, a typically constructed wall for a wood frame (so-called "stick-built") dwelling or commercial building has about 6 layers (from inside to outside): sheetrock, vapor barrier, 2"x 4" frame components including let-in braces or plywood sheets added for racking strength 5 interspersed with insulation, weather barrier, sheathing, and external siding.Thus, there are an average of eight or more steps needed to construct a wall including both interior and exterior portions. This multitude of steps is costly and requires significant challenges to the builder to keep inventory on hand, to protect the inventory from 0 theft, and to protect partially completed side walls from vandalism and degradation by weather. It is therefore be desirable in the art to enable builders to construct walls more efficiently

CLAIMS :
1. Astructural siding composition for use in the building industry comprising
(a) a siding layer prepared from an impregnated cellulosic material with an amount of essentially uncatalyzed polyisocyanate from about 8 to 20 percent by weight of polyisocyanate to cellulosic material, which has been heated at a temperature from about 105 to about 245째C (221 to 473째F) for a time not exceeding about 5 minutes and at a pressure from about 2700 to about 8300 kPa (390 to 1200 psi) sufficiently to cure the polyisocyanate, and

9. The composition of Claim 1 in which the cellulosic material has a moisture 5 content not exceeding about 7 percent.
10. The composition of Claim 1 wherein the insulating layer is a polyurethane, polyurea, polyisocyanurate or polystyrene foam. 


 1 1. The composition of Claim 1 further comprising an inner sheathing layer proximate to the insulating layer and distal to the siding layer.
12. The composition of Claim 1 wherein the inner sheathing layer is steel, wood, aluminum, a fiber-reinforced polymer, or the impregnated cellulosic material of Claim 1.
13. The composition of Claim 1 further comprising an adhesive between the siding layer and the insulating layer.
14. The composition of Claim 1 1 further comprising an adhesive between the insulating layer and the inner sheathing layer.
15. The composition of Claim 1 wherein the siding layer is a laminate of two or more impregnated sheets of cellulosic material.
16. The composition of Claim 1 wherein the siding layer is profiled.
17. A method of preparing a structural siding composition for use in the building industry comprising
(a) preparing a siding layer from an impregnated cellulosic material prepared using an amount of essentially uncatalyzed polyisocyanate of from about 8 to 20 percent by weight of polyisocyanate to cellulosic material, which has beenjieated at a temperature from about 105 to about 245째C (221 to 473째F) for a time not exceeding about 5 minutes and at a pressure from about 2700 to about 8300 kPa (390 to 1200 psi) sufficiently to cure the polyisocyanate, and
(b) positioning an insulating layer proximate thereto.
18. The method of Claim 17 further comprising profiling the siding layer.
19. The method of Claim 17 wherein the insulating layer is prepared in situ from a reaction mixture.
20. The method of Claim 17 further comprising (c) positioning an inner sheathing layer proximate to the insulating layer and distal to the siding layer.
21. The method of Claim 17 further comprising positioning an adhesive between the siding layer and the insulating layer. 


 22. The method of Claim 20 further comprising positioning an adhesive between the insulating layer and the inner sheathing layer.
