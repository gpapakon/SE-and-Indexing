<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatographic single-pass multiple station (e.g. 
multi-colour) duplex printer is described for forming an 

image onto a web (12). The printer comprises at least 
three toner image-producing electrostatographic stations 

(A, B, C, D, A', B', C', D'). Each station has rotatable 
endless surface means in the form of a photoconductive 

drum (26) onto which a toner image can be formed. The 
printer also includes drive rollers (22a, 22b) for 

conveying the web (12) in succession past said stations 
(A, B, C, D, A', B', C', D'). Corona discharge devices 

transfer the toner image on each rotatable surface means 
(26) onto the web (12). The image-producing stations (A, 

B, C, D, A', B', C', D') are arranged in two sub-groups, 
the drum (26) of one sub-group forming a backing roller 

for the other sub-group, and vice-versa, thereby to 
enable simultaneous duplex printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrostatographic
single-pass multiple station duplex printer for forming
images onto a web, in particular but not exclusively to a
multi-colour printer for printing onto a paper web, and
especially such a printer as is capable of printing
colour images for professional purposes as a cost
effective alternative to conventional printing of short
to medium sized runs.The need for duplex printing from both practical and
economic points of view has long been recognised and in
classical printing with liquid printing ink, as eg in
offset printing of books and journals, duplex printing is
common practice.Electrostatographic printing is based on the image-wise
formation of an electrostatic latent image that is
developed with electrostatically attractable colorant
particles, called toner particles, whereupon the toner
image is transferred to the printing stock material,
usually paper.Electrostatographic printing operates according to the
principles and embodiments of non-impact printing as
described, eg in Principles of Non-Impact Printing by
Jerome L Johnson - Palatino Press - Irvine CA, 92715 
USA). Electrostatographic printing includes
electrographic printing in which an electrostatic charge
is deposited image-wise on a dielectric recording member
as well as electrophotographic printing in which an
overall electrostatically charged photoconductive
dielectric recording member is image-wise exposed to
conductivity-increasing radiation producing thereby a
"direct or reversal mode" toner-developable charge
pattern.By "direct development mode" in electrophotography is
meant that toner is electrostatically deposited on the
non-photo-exposed areas, whereas in "reversal development
mode" toner is electrostatically deposited on the photo-exposed
areas. In the last-mentioned development mode a
development electrode biased with a charge polarity the
same as the polarity of the toner particles ensures that
the toner particles are deposited in the photo-exposed
areas.Reversal development mode is not only of interest when
negative originals have to be reproduced as positive
prints, but likewise when the exposure source is
modulated to expose the photoconductor in correspondence
with the "black" information to be printed and not in
correspondence with the large blank areas of graphic art
originals such as printed pages. In that way the
exposure source such as a modulated laser source or
light-emitting diode array (LED) exposure source
controlled normally by a digital electrical signal
