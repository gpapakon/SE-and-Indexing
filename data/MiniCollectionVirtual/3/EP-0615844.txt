<ABSTRACT>
A modular ink jet print head has modules (1) with three spacers (20) on their periphery in order to maintain a constant spacing b between the modules (1). The latter are attached to the module part by their base surface (34) standing upright on a reference plane. The spacers of the one module are brought into contact with at least those of one further module. A base plate (36) and two limbs (38) arranged on two first sides of the base plate (36) form a U-shaped module carrier (10). For the modules, fastening elements (23, 24, 25, 26) are arranged on the two second sides of the base plate (36) and adjusting means (27, 28) are arranged on the limbs (38). On one side - located parallel to one of the second sides of the base plate, offset stop edges (29) for all the modules (1) are worked into the common opening (37) of the base plate (36) for the leading edges of all the modules (1). The reference edge (21) of each module (1) is brought into contact with an assigned stop edge (29) on the base plate (36), thus resulting in a defined lateral offset c between the modules (1).
