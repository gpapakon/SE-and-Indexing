<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of 2-fluoroisobutyric acid or an ester thereof. 
The 2-fluoroisobutyric acid or the ester thereof, obtained by 
the present invention, is useful as an intermediate for a 
triazine-based herbicide. As a triazine-based herbicide, International PCT 
Publication WO90/09378 discloses a triazine-based herbicide in 
which a phenoxyalkylamino group is substituted on a triazine 
ring, for example, as shown by the formula, 
 
and this Publication describes that the above triazine-based 
herbicide has remarkable advantages in that it is not only 
excellent in herbicidal activity but also free from 
phytotoxicity to rice on a paddy field. The phenoxyalkylamino-substituted triazine-based herbicide 
of this type is obtained by reacting 2-fluoroisobutyrate with 
2-phenoxy-1-methyl-ethylbiguanide. As a method for producing  
 
2-fluoroisobutyrate used in the above reaction, U. S. Patent 
5,175,345 discloses a method in which 2-hydroxyisobutyrate is 
reacted (a) with fluorosulfuric acid in the presence or absence 
of a hydrogen fluoride source or (b) with chlorosulfuric acid 
in the presence of hydrogen fluoride. This conventional 
method is shown by a reaction scheme below. 
In the method using 2-hydroxyisobutyrate as a raw 
material, described in the above U. S. Patent, 
2-fluoroisobutyrate can be obtained at relatively high yields, 
while a large amount of methacrylate having a boiling point 
close to that of the 2- fluoroisobutyrate is formed as a 
byproduct. Industrially disadvantageously, therefore, the 
post treatment for removing the methacrylate formed as a 
byproduct is complicated. For achieving high yields, further, 
a large amount (at least 6 mol per mole of the raw material) 
of fluorosulfuric acid is required, and it is required to 
neutralize unreacted fluorosulfuric acid with an alkali such  
 
as Ca(OH)2 before disposal. There is hence another defect in 
that a large amount of waste is formed. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a process which enables the production of 
2-fluoroisobutyric acid or its ester in a simple apparatus at 
high yields while preventing the formation of a byproduct 
which is difficult to separate. The present inventors have found that, by reacting 2-hydroxyisobutyric 
acid or its ester with thionyl chloride and 
a hydrogen fluoride source, 2-fluoroisobutyric acid or its 
ester can be produced in a simple apparatus at high yields 
while preventing the formation of a byproduct, and on basis
