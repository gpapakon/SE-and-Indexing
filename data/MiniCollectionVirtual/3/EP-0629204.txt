<DESCRIPTION>
 1 CEPHAL0SP0RIN DERIVATIVESThis invention relates to novel β-lactam compounds, their preparation and their use, and in particular to a novel class of cephalosporins. These 5 compounds have antibacterial properties, and are therefore of use in the( treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals caused by a wide range of organisms.We have now found a particularly advantageous class of polycyclic 10 compounds based upon a cephalosporin nucleus.The present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof:15 (I)whereinRl is hydrogen, methoxy or formamido;R2 is an acyl group, in particular that of an antibacterially active 20 cephalosporin;CO2R is a carboxy group or a carboxylate anion, or R3 is a readily removable carboxy protecting group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt- forming group or in vivo hydrolysable ester group;R , R5, R6 nd R7 independently represent hydrogen or a substituent 25 group; wherein R^ and R? may be absent and be replaced by a chemical bond between the two carbon atoms shown; and wherein R and R^ may be linked together into a cyclic system of formula: 30
wherein X represents - O - or - N 8 _> wherein each R^ may be the same or different and independently represents hydrogen or a substituent group, or two groups R^ may be linked into a ring system, or any two adjacent - CR^2 - units may be replaced by a - CRβ = CRβ - unit, and wherein n is an integer 1 to 7, m is 0, 1, 2 or 3.In compounds of formula (I) wherein R^- is formamido, the formamido group can exist in conformations wherein the hydrogen atoms of the -NH-CHO moiety are cjt£- or trans-; of these the _as conformation normally predominates.Since the compounds of the present invention are intended for use as therapeutic agents for antibacterial use in pharmaceutical compositions, it will be readily appreciated that preferred compounds within formula (I) are pharmaceutically acceptable, L£_ are compounds of formula (Ia) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or pharmaceutically acceptable in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof:
 da)wherein B. R2, R4, R5, R6} nd R? are as defined with respect to formula (I) and the group C02R-----* is CO2R^ where CO2R^ is a carboxy group or a carboxylate anion.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, for use as a therapeutic agent, and in particular an in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof for use as an orally administrable therapeutic agent.The present invention further
