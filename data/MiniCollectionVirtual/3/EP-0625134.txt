Method of producing light C₂+ hydrocarbons, in 
particular ethylene and ethane, from a gas mixture 

produced in the cracking of hydrocarbons and having been 
freed of high molecular weight hydrocarbons, characterized 

in that the low molecular weight C₂+ hydrocarbons are 
scrubbed from the gas mixture by absorption by means of 

an organic, preferably paraffinic, physically acting 
scrubbing medium in an absorption column, the scrubbing 

medium having a molecular weight between 50 and 75 g/mol, 
preferably between 60 and 75 g/mol, the circulated 

scrubbing medium being first loaded with low molecular 
weight hydrocarbons, regenerated in a regeneration column 

and subsequently returned to the absorption column for 
renewed loading. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a C₄+ hydrocarbon fraction, preferably pentane, 

isopentane or mixtures thereof is employed as the scrubbing 
medium. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the loaded scrubbing medium prior 

to being fed into the regeneration column is stripped by 
means of a stripping gas, in particular co-absorbed 

methane being stripped off. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 

that the stripping of the loaded scrubbing medium is 
carried out in a lower section of the absorption column. 
Method according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that vaporized scrubbing medium is employed as stripping 

gas. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,  
 

characterized in that the cracked gas is fed into the 
absorption column at a pressure of 4 to 50 bar, preferably 

10 to 30 bar. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the absorption is carried out at 

temperatures between 0 and -50°C, preferably between -30 
and -50°C, particularly preferably between -35 and -45°C. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the temperature in the bottom of 

the regeneration column does not exceed 120°C, preferably 
105°C. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the pressure in the regeneration 

column is below that of the absorption column. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the gas containing C₂ hydrocarbons 

and C₃ hydrocarbons after having been withdrawn from the 
head of the regeneration column and separated from 

condensate after its partial condensation is subjected to 
a C₂/C₃ separation and in that C₂ hydrocarbons withdrawn 

from the C₂/C₃ separation are separated further into 
ethylene- and ethane-containing product gas streams.
