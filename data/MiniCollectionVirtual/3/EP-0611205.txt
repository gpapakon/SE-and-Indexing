<ABSTRACT>
Process for recovery of papermaking fibres from paper waste or scrap comprising cellulose fibres embedded in a reprecipitated cellulose matrix resulting from a treatment (during the manufacture of the said paper) with a view to making the latter suitable for a specific use, characterised by the following stages:   a)- the paper scrap (2) is placed in contact with an aqueous medium containing enzymes (4) capable of attacking reprecipitated cellulose with a view to its hydrolysis, this being for a sufficient time allowing the impregnation of the said paper scrap; b)- this contact between the paper scrap and the said aqueous medium is maintained (7) at a temperature of between 30 and 65@C for a sufficient period to allow a hydrolysis of the reprecipitated cellulose; and c)- the paper scrap feedstock is subjected to a physical defibring action by wet mechanical grinding (5) until a suspension of the liberated fibres in the liquid medium is obtained.

Process for recovering paper fibers in the form of an aqueous suspension 
from paper scraps or waste (2) comprising cellulosic fibers embedded in a 

reprecipitated cellulose matrix resulting from a treatment (during manufacture of 
said paper) with a view to rendering the latter suitable for a specific use, 

characterized by the following steps: 

a) preparing said paper waste (2) in the form of unitary or individual charge 
(6), 
b) placing said paper charge or charges (6) in contact with an aqueous 
medium (4) containing enzymes adapted to attack the reprecipitated cellulose 

with a view to hydrolysis thereof, for a sufficient time allowing impregnation of 
said paper waste, 
c) evacuating said charge or charges (6) from said aqueous medium, 
d) disposing said charge or charges (6) in an atmosphere at controlled 
temperature and hygrometry for a time sufficient to allow enzymatic hydrolysis of 

the reprecipitated cell; and 
e) subjecting the charge of paper waste to a physical action of fiber 
separation by mechanical trituration until a suspension of the fibers released in the 

liquid medium is obtained. 
Process for recovering paper fibers in the form of an aqueous suspension 
from paper scraps or waste (2) comprising cellulosic fibers embedded in a matrix 

of reprecipitated cellulose resulting from a treatment (during manufacture of said 
paper) with a view to rendering the latter suitable for a specific use, in which the 

paper waste (2) is placed in contact with an aqueous medium (4) containing  
 

micro-organisms adapted to attack the cellulose, characterized by the following 
steps: 


a) the paper waste is placed in contact with enzymes adapted to attack the 
reprecipitated cellulose with a view to hydrolysis thereof, for a time sufficient to 

allow intimate contact of the paper support and the liquid medium containing the 
enzymatic complex, the liquid medium/paper waste mixture being subjected to 

stirring in a closed enclosure; 
b) on leaving the first enclosure, the liquid medium and the paper waste are 
subjected to stirring in a second enclosure for a time sufficient to obtain a 

maceration of the paper medium in the enzymatic liquid phase with a view to 
hydrolysis; 
c) the liquid/paper waste assembly is subjected, after maceration, to a step 
of separation of the pellets with a view to separating, within the treated medium, 

fibrous agglomerates or pellets. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that it further comprises the 
steps of recycling after the separation step, with a view to recycling the pellets or 

fibrous agglomerates and subjecting the latter to the maceration step, in that it 
further comprises a step, after the separation step, of fiber-separation with 

stirring. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that the phase of stirring (a) 
is conducted simultaneously with the phase of maceration (b). 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that the 
hydrolytic attack of the cellulose is produced in an aqueous medium (4) containing 

an enzymatic complex based on cellulases.  
 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in that the enzymatic complex 
introduced in the aqueous medium (4) is based on enzymes produced by a microorganism 

of humicola, trichoderma or aspergillus strain. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that the 
liquid medium is maintained at a temperature included between 45 and 60°C with 

a pH close to neutrality, and included between 4 and 8. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that the
