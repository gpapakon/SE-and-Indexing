<ABSTRACT>
In a method for washing mattresses, the mattresses (6), lying flat, are introduced into a container (1) filled with liquid (2) and are dipped so deep into the liquid that the mattress rests on a base (3) and does not float, for the top side of the mattress is fulled and simultaneously subjected to liquid. A device for carrying out the method consists of a trough-shaped container (1) for receiving the liquid, a rotary conveyor (3) arranged in the container underneath the liquid level, a liquid outflow (8) arranged at a distance above the liquid level (2a), a pump arrangement (9) for conveying liquid out of the container to the liquid outflow, and a fulling roller (7) movable over the liquid level (2a). A plurality of devices of this type can be assembled in a modular manner to form an entire installation. The device can also be operated as an individual installation.
