<ABSTRACT>
Method for determining the purity of prepared used glass, in which the sample quantity is removed from the stream of prepared used glass and the foreign bodies still contained therein are sorted, and non- ferrous metals and opaque foreign materials, such as ceramic and porcelain particles and stones, are sorted out, weighed and are set in relation to the weight of the total sample. In order to be able to analyse a sample simply, it is provided that the sample is poured out in a single layer and is allowed to trickle over a free-fall path and foreign bodies consisting of non-ferrous metals are blown out and subsequently opaque foreign bodies are blown out and are collected in containers separately from the non-ferrous metals.

<CLAIMS>
A method for determining the purity of processed waste
glass, in which the sample quantity is taken from the

processed waste glass stream and the foreign matter
which is still contained therein and is separated

according to non-ferrous metals and opaque foreign
particles such as ceramic and porcelain particles and

stones is sorted out, weighed and put in relation to
the weight of the entire sample, characterized in that

the sample is deposited in one stratified layer and is
allowed to flow over a free-falling track (13) and

foreign particles made of non-ferrous metals and
opaque foreign particles are blown out separately and

are collected in separate containers (20, 21) for non-ferrous
metals and opaque foreign matter.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
the sample is dried before falling over the free-falling

track (13).
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the foreign particles collected from at least one

sample in the containers (20, 21) for receiving
foreign particles from non-ferrous metals or opaque

foreign particles are hand-picked with respect to
glass parts which were also blown out and a correction

factor is calculated from the ratio of glass parts to
foreign particles which is considered in the

determination of the share of the respective foreign
particles in the processed waste glass.
A method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that before the free-falling track

(13) particles are screened out which fall below a
certain size and the share of the extracted foreign 

particles is put in relationship with with the
remaining sample quantity.
A device to perform the method as claimed in one of
the claims 1 to 4, with a feed device (8) which is

provided downstream with an oscillating conveyor (9)
and a free-falling track (13) which is arranged

downstream of a chute (12), with sensors (14, 15)
being arranged which control two blower nozzles (16,

17) which are assigned to different collecting
containers (20, 21) and are arranged in two rows which

are mutually distanced in the falling direction and
extend transversally to the falling track (13), and

with a pure-glass container (23) being provided,
characterized in that a sampling device (3) is

provided which is introduceable into a stream of
processed waste glass and is movable towards the feed

device (8), and the sensors (14, 15) are arranged in
the zone of the chute (12) of the free-falling track

(13), which is downstream of the same, in separate
rows which extend transversally to the same and are

provided for the detection of non-ferrous parts and
opaque parts.
A device as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that
the pure-glass container (23) and the containers (20,

21) are connected with weighing devices (24).
A device as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized in
that the oscillating conveyor (9) can be charged with

hot air.
A device as claimed in one of the claims 5 to 6,
characterized in that the chute (12) is provided

upstream with a screen for separating particles which
fall below a certain size.
