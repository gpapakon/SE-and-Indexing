<ABSTRACT>
Filling units (11) for supplying small tanks or the like with gasoline, kerosene, or other flowable materials which attach to an inlet to such a tank (13). When the filling unit is in a fill position, a displacer section (21) occupies a substantial volume within the tank. It allows the person filling the tank to supply the liquid until the tank will accept no more and the liquid reaches a predetermined level (62) in a funnel portion (19) of the filler. Thereafter, manipulation of the displacer section (21) vertically within the tank, as for example by sliding a section of the overall unit upward, accommodates all the liquid remaining in the funnel up to such predetermined level within the tank by occupying the volume previously occupied by the displacer section and thereby completing the filling of the tank to a full condition without any spillage. The overall unit may be such that it is intended to be removed from the tank after each filling operation, or it may be designed to fit permanently within a wide-mouth tank inlet (89) and to be movable downward to a storage orientation which allows the unit (87) to remain mounted in the tank inlet and covered by the protective cap (117) that normally screws onto the inlet opening to close it.

<DESCRIPTION>
FILLING UNIT PREVENTING THE OVERFILLING OF SMALL TANKS OR THE LIKE.This patent is available for licensing or purchase. The invention relates generally to funnel- like fillers and more particularly to such units designed to mount on small tanks.Background of the Invention The filling of small tanks with liquids has long been a source of inventive ideas, particularly as small gasoline motors and kerosene heaters have proliferated. Inventions of many types have resulted. Funnels have been designed with almost every type of signal to indicate when the tank is full. Some devices require the small vessel containing the source liquid to be equipped with special spouts. Some spouts have a mechanical trip valve at the end which rests on the mouth of the tank to be filled, with the operator moving the source liquid tank to open or close the trip valve, making such decision by observing the liquid level through the tank opening. A common problem with the valved spouts is visually seeing the liquid level inside the tank so as to know when to stop pouring. Frequently, the first indication of being "filled" is also an overflow. Some have spouts which contain two passages, one for liquid being poured, the other for the return air, and the dual passage spout is inserted into the to-be-filled tank's opening. When the liquid level therein rises with filling, the return air vent is covered so that flow characteristics change, and the operator then lowers the source tank to where flow isn't possible.In a variation of the return air control, a dual passage, transparent connection line is connected 

 to the openings of both the tank to be filled and the source tank. The operator observes the return flow through the transparent connection line and controls the flow by raising or lowering the source tank. Each of these inventions has had some shortcoming, as none has become a universally accepted solution. A general problem with prior funnel devices has been either their complexity (valves, air passages, etc.) or the funnel's resting in the tank opening which obscures the view of the liquid level in the tank. It can be observed that, when pouring at normal rates into a funnel, a certain liquid level tends to accumulate in the lower portion of a conical funnel, just above where the liquid enters the throat. This occurs whether the funnel is conical with a round (straight or tapered) throat or is of square, rectangular, ellipsoidal or compound cross section. When the tank below the funnel becomes full, the level in the funnel

 STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 19
The following amendments have been effected by the substitute pages.
Claims 1, 4 and 10 have now been canceled, and the subject matter rewritten in new Claims 1, 4 and 10 on pages 31, 32 and 33.
The amendments to Claims 1 and 4 simply transfer the recitation of the formula defining the preferable extent of displacer volume (see page 4, lines 27-29) to a dependent claim and effect some minor deletions and a positive recitation that the funnel, when installed in the filling position, extends above the tubular inlet to the container, which of course is quite clear from all of the drawings. The minor amendment to Claim 10 adds no new matter but simply shifts the wording to provide antecedent basis while retaining the terminology of the original claim.
It is believed that the claims as amended do not go beyond the disclosure of the International application as filed and thus may be appropriately made.
It is respectfully requested that this amendment be entered in accordance with PCT Article 19(1).
