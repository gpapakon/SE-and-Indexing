<ABSTRACT>
A jacketed signal conduit (34) has a blocking 
material (42) between the signal conduit member (38) and the 

jacket (36), to inhibit fluid intrusion and migration 
between the signal conduit jacket (36) and the signal 

conduit member (38). A jacketed signal conduit cable (30) 
comprises one or more of these jacketed signal conduits (34) 

in a cable jacket (32) with a blocking material (40) between 
the cable jacket (32) and the conduit jacket (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a jacketed signal 
and conduits and, more particularly, to such conduits 
wherein water migration is prevented. Generally, in the process of acquiring seismic 
data, recording instruments responsive to particle motion 
are selectively positioned above the subterranean formation 
of interest. Energy, generated by artificial means, such as 
for example by explosives, air guns or vibrators, is 
transmitted into the earth to impart motion to the area of 
the earth proximal to the origin of the seismic energy. The 
transmitted energy is then reflected and refracted by 
subsurface geological strata. Reflected and refracted 
energies are recorded by the receivers, such as geophones or 
hydrophones, responsive thereto. For seismic exploration conducted on land or below 
the surface of the earth such as in a well bore, geophones 
are generally used to record reflected and refracted 
energies. For seismic exploration conducted at sea, 
hydrophones are generally used to record reflected and 
refracted energies. Whether seismic exploration occurs on 
land, in a well bore or at sea, both types of receivers, 
hydrophones and geophones, generally require signal 
conduits, such as electrical  
 
conduits, for interconnecting such receivers and for 
connecting such receivers to other recording and processing 
equipment. Preferably, due to greater flexibility, resiliency, and 
signal portability, multi-stranded signal conduits are use for 
seismic exploration. An assembly of signal conduits connected 
to receivers (hydrophones and/or geophones) is commonly 
referred to as a "cable array". In many instances, the cable 
array may consist of a plurality of sub-cable arrays connected 
together, such as the Ocean Bottom Cable Assembly, a product 
of Halliburton Geophysical Services. In many instances, cable arrays are deployed in austere 
environments. Under these conditions, cable arrays must be 
designed such that the components, i.e., receivers, signal 
conduits, and connections between the receivers and signal 
conduits, remain insulated from such conditions. When 
designing cable arrays for operation in such austere 
conditions, preventing the intrusion and migration of a fluid, 
such as water, within the cable array is a concern. Generally, the cable array designer may select an 
elastomer, such as polyurethane or neoprene as a primary 
insulator which is placed between the receiver or signal 
conduit and the environment. This is done by jacketing the 
hydrophones and geophones and
