<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides cellulose ester fibers having an intermediate degree of substitution per anhydroglucose unit (DS/AGU) along with pigments which act as photooxidation catalysts. The fibers are useful as filter materials for tobacco products. The filter materials thus provided are easily dispersible and biodegradable and do not persist in the environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ENVIRONMENTALLY NON-PERSISTANT CELLULOSE ESTER FIBERSThis invention relates to cellulose ester fibers. In particular, this invention relates to cellulose ester fibers that are useful as tobacco smoke filters.Due to a growing environmental awareness worldwide, the concept of product stewardship is rapidly becoming a reality for many manufacturing companies. It is no longer considered acceptable to be concerned only with the environmental consequences of a particular manu¬ facturing process or the hazards associated with a particular chemical. Increasingly, industry is recognizing that public opinion dictates that they be held accountable for the environmental fate of their products after their intended function is complete. At the moment the need to be responsible product stewards is primarily driven by a response to public perception, but it is not at all unreasonable to envision that public opinion will soon be replaced by legal mandates. The technical difficulties associated with being a responsible product steward are extremely complex. The chemical industry is being asked to both provide products with the performance characteristics that the public has grown to expect, and also products which will not persist in the environment. Viewed from current polymer technology, these product requirements are often mutually exclusive. Thus far, the response of individual chemical companies has been largely configured around their existing product streams. For producers of commodity goods, such as plastics used in packaging, the focus has been mainly on recycling. How¬ ever, it is becoming increasing apparent that for many disposable items, recycling or incineration do not represent feasible options. Cigarette filters are a classic example of a product type for which it would be 

extremely difficult to design and implement an effective collection and recycling or disposal program. Discarded cigarette filters represent a significant surface litter problem, even in areas where proper disposal receptacles are conveniently available. Thus, there is a critical market need for biodegradable materials which will not persist in the environment.The term "biodegradable" is becoming an increasingly popular label for manufacturers to place on their products. Unfortunately its application in many cases is inaccurate and misleading. As a direct result of the unregulated use of this term, environmental groups and the public have generally come to distrust a manufacturer's claims regarding biodegradable commodities. This
