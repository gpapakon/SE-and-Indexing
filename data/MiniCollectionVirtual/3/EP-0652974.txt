Probes and primers which differentiate between the two are also provided. Ligase chain reaction (LCR) may also be applied. The specific oligonucleotide probes and primers of the invention can be applied to oocysts in samples such as surface water, faeces etc. when a preferred embodiment which breaks these open is applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the detection and/or 
identification of organisms and/or nucleic acid sequences of 
Cryptosporidium parvum (C.parvum) or baileyi (C.baileyi) and to 
oligonucleotides and test kits containing them for use in said method. Cryptosporidosis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoans of the 
coccidial genus Cryptosporidium. In the UK, the first human 
infections were reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance 
Service in June 1983 and between then and 1989 reported cases had 
risen to 8,019 per annum. The disease has an incubation period of 1-14 days with symptoms 
lasting for 7-60 days and pathogenicity demonstrated mainly in a 
syndrome of diarrhoea of newborns and in cases of severe and prolonged 
gastroenteritis in immunodeficient patients. However, in people with 
a normal immune response the vast majority of cases involve acute 
self-limiting diarrhoeal symptoms. There is no chemotherapy, only 
supportive treatment can be offered. The following species and respective hosts have been determined by 
cross-transmission studies: 
C.parvummammals C.murisrodents (mice) C.baileyiavians C.meleagridisavians C.crotalireptiles C.nasorumfish Large numbers of oocysts have been recovered from waste, surface and  
 
recreational waters, but their origin is unknown. These oocysts have 
been known to survive for considerable periods in water and are 
unaffected by conventional water treatments (Smith et al (1989) 
Parasitology 99:323-7). It is known that cryptosporidiosis is a zoonosis and several human 
outbreaks have implicated bovine slurry runoff into water sources as a 
focus of infection, but the importance of this route is not fully 
understood as currently there is no adequate test to distinguish 
between different oocysts (Chermetie et al (1988) Cryptosporidiosis: 
2nd edition. Technical series number 5. Office International des 
epizooties. Paris). The present invention provides an improved method for diagnosis of 
cryptosporidiosis, an important zoonosis involving farm animals, and 
further provides oligonucleotide probes and polymerase chain reaction 
primers specific to C.parvum and C.baileyi and still further provides 
probes and primers which differentiate between the two. The invention provides a method of detecting and identifying C.parvum 
and baileyi specifically by identifying DNA of SEQ ID No 7 or 8, or 
subsequences having SEQ ID No 1, 2, 5 or 6 described herein, by use of 
hybridization probing and/or nucleotide sequence amplification, eg by 
p
