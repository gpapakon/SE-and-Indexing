<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel water-based 
coating composition utilizable in the whole field of 
precoated metals and in the post-coating field. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a water-based coating 
composition which forms a coated film having a high degree of 
processability, anticorrosive properties, and suitability for 
re-coating in the field of water-based coatings (primers) for 
use in producing rust-proof automotive steel sheets or primed 
steel sheets for electrical appliances, building materials, 
etc. Electrogalvanized steel sheet, welding-plated steel 
sheet, and steel sheets plated with various alloys are 
produced and extensively used in applications such as 
electrical appliances, automobiles, and building materials. 
Under these circumstances, there is a growing desire in 
recent years especially for surface-treated steel sheets 
having excellent corrosion resistance, and the demand for 
such steel sheets tends to increase. In the automobile industry, the demand for surface-treated 
steel sheets with excellent corrosion resistance is 
strong from the standpoints of safety and economy because 
automotive bodies are exposed to severe corrosive  
 
environments, as seen in the corrosion caused by rock salt 
scattered on roads for the purpose of antifreezing in the 
North America and other regions and the corrosion caused by 
acid rain attributable to smokes emitted from industrial 
areas. Well known as a surface-treated steel sheet having 
the desired corrosion resistance is a steel sheet covered 
with an organic film (precoated steel sheet). For forming 
organic coated films in the production of such coated steel 
sheets, use is made of water-based coating compositions 
containing polyester, polyurethane, or polyolefin resins or 
the like which are water-soluble, water-dilutable, or water-dispersible. 
Because these coating compositions are water-based, 
they have advantages that there is no danger of 
causing a fire or polluting the working atmosphere and that 
the coated films formed therefrom are excellent in mechanical 
strength, flexibility, and solvent resistance. However, 
there has been a problem that since a hydrophilic group 
should be incorporated in a large amount in order to make the 
resins water-soluble, water-dilutable, or water-dispersible, 
the coated films are insufficient especially in water 
resistance, durability, and the like. As an expedient for overcoming the above problem, a 
technique has recently been disclosed which comprises 
incorporat
