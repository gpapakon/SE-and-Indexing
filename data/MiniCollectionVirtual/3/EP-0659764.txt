<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of molecules
containing phosphine groups for labelling with 99mTc ,
186-188Re or paramagnetic agents.The labelling of protein or peptide molecules with 99mTc and
186-188Re is the future challenge in the field of
radiopharmaceuticals both for diagnosis and for
radiotherapy.Quite a number of results relating to the coupling to
protein molecules of so-called "chelating agents" which
enable the radionuclide to remain firmly bonded thereto
are already reported in the literature.Moreover, in recent years, chelating agents which contain
small peptides (for example MAG3) have been studied, that
is, it has been established that, in the co-ordinating
(chelating) set around the technetium or rhenium, amide
groups or other groups belonging to amino-acids such as,
for example, -SH, -COOH, -NH2, OH, etc., can contribute
to the stabilization of the metal-chelating agent
complex.The study of new tracers for magnetic resonance is also
of very great interest. The principle for the design of
these new molecules is again that of possessing a useful
biological tropism. The difference lies in the tracer
which, for magnetic resonance, has to have a highly
paramagnetic element. The discovery of these molecules
would allow this technique to make a qualitative jump
from topology to functional diagnostics. Conference Technetium and Rhenium in Chemistry and Nuclear
Medicine 3, Cortina International, 1989, Verona, Italy,
pages 433-444, Edwards D.S. et al., discloses N2S2 diaminedithiol
ligands for technetium and rhenium and particularly
a 99mTc radiopharmaceutical, Neuroliteâ„¢, based on the ligand
N,N'-1,2-ethylenediylbis-L-cysteine, diethylester, which is
reported to show promise as a marker of regional cerebral
blood flow.J.Chem.Soc.Dalton Trans., vol.19, 1993, pages 2901-2908,
Refosco Fiorenzo et al., discloses bidentate ligands with
a phosphine-carboxylic acid donor set which form technetium
complexes of the type TcL3, where L is the ligand.Nucl.Med.Biol., vol.14, n.5, 1987, pages 503-510, Neves Maria
et al., discloses neutral technetium (II)-99m complexes
of the general formula tr-[99mTcIID2X2]0, where D represents a
chelating ditertiary phosphine or arsine ligand and X represents
a halide or pseudohalide ligand.WO93/08839 relates to multifunctional ligands for potential
use in the design of therapeutic or diagnostic radiopharmaceutical
imaging agents.EP-A-0 527 056 relates to oligopeptides which are disclosed
for in vivo tumour imaging and therapy.As a result of the present invention,
