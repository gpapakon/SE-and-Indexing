<ABSTRACT>
A video type color film analyzer for displaying color images 
of a plurality of picture frames of a color film in a matrix 

on a video image display device, wherein color image signals 
of each said picture frame being provided by a color TV 

camera and being gradation transformed according to its 
exposed condition to simulate printed color images of said 

displayed color images, comprising means for specifiying one 
of said color images displayed device and means for 

magnifying an entire one of said specified color image on 
said video image display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
used for analysing or inspecting color films.Video type color film analyzers are well known in the art.
One example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No. JP-A-62 - 141,530 has a color TV camera for providing color image
data of picture frames of a number of rolls of color films
spliced one another. The color image data of the respective
picture frames are stored in a memory. The color image data of
each picture frame read out from the memory is, after having
been transformed in gradation based on its large area
transmittance density (LATD) and transformed from negative form
to positive form, sent to one of a plurality of CRT displays
arranged in a line to display a simulated color image thereon.
Color film analyzer of this type can display a plurality of
color images, simulated and to be simulated, on the CRT
displays in a line. The center CRT display displays a color
image under inspection and/or correction and the remaining CRT
displays, in particular on one side of the center CRT display,
color images inspected and corrected if needed and, on the 
opposite side of the center display, color images to be
inspected. Therefore, the simulated color image on the center
CRT display can be estimated comparing with adjacent corrected
and uncorrected color images.In another color film analyzer of this type disclosed in,
for example, U.S. Patent Nos. US-A-4,364,084 and US-A-4,531,150, the
color images simulated or to be simulated are displayed in a
matrix pattern. Any one of the displayed color images, if
undesirable in color and/or density as a printed image, is
specified with such as a light pen to correct exposure. Image
data of the specified image is transformed in gradation
according to the corrected exposure so that the color image is
correctly changed in color and/or density.The image data of picture frames to be displayed are
written in and read out from an image memory as is disclosed
in, for example, European Unexamined Patent Publication No.
EP-A-0 108,158.Such video type color film analyzers are associated with
various drawbacks. Because a roll of color film often includes
frames bearing unintended principal subject images, blurred
images or the like which usually need not be printed. The color
film analyzers heretofore used are hard to specify an image or
images which are unnecessary to print from visual inspection.
It is therefore often to repeatedly specify picture frames
having no necessity of print.It is also difficult to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A video-type color film analyser (10,32) for
displaying color images of a plurality of picture

frames of a color film (13) in a matrix on a video
image display device (33), color image signals of

each said picture frame being provided by a color TV
camera (83) and being gradation transformed

according to its exposed condition to simulate
printed color images of said displayed color images,

said analyzer comprising:

means for specifying (40) one of said color images
displayed on said video image display device (33);

and
means for magnifying (142) the entire
specified color image on said video image display

device.
A video-type color film analyzer (10,32) for
displaying color images as defined in claim 1,

wherein said means for magnifying (142) also
terminates the display of the remaining images.
A video-type color film analyzer (10,32) as defined
in claim 1 or 2, wherein said remaining images are

stored while said specified
color image is magnified.
