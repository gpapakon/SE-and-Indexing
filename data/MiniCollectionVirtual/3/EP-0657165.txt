<ABSTRACT>
A liver protectant comprising a phosphoric diester 
compound of the following formula (wherein R₁ and R₂ 

are the same or different and each represents hydrogen 
or methyl) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt 

thereof. 

   The liver protectant composition of this invention 
effectively inhibits the elevation of GOT and GPT, 

among other parameters, so that it is useful for the 
prevention and therapy of acute liver disorder, chronic 

liver disorder and fulminant liver disorder. It can 
also be used in cirrhosis of the liver with success. 

The liver protectant composition of this invention can 
be used with advantage in liver damage associated with 

alcohol intake and hepatic impairment due to 
acetaminophen and other drugs. Furthermore, the liver 

protectant composition of this invention is of value in 
acute intrahepatic cholestasis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a useful liver 
protectant composition. More particularly, this 
invention relates to a useful liver protectant 
composition comprising an ascorbyl tocopheryl phosphate 
compound or a pharmacologically acceptable salt 
thereof. Many of the liver protectants heretofore in use 
are compounds having an SH radical, typically cysteine 
and glutathione. However, while these substances have 
detoxicating activity on the strength of their active 
SH radicals, they have the disadvantage that the very 
SH radicals they have detract from the pharmacological 
efficacy of concomitant medication. Therefore, in the field of medicine, a better 
liver protectant free of the above-mentioned drawback 
is in demand. The inventors of this invention who explored the 
pharmacological action profile of ascorbyl tocopheryl 
phosphate compounds discovered that these compounds and 
their pharmacologically acceptable salts have a  
 
meritorious liver-protective action and, based on this 
finding, perfected this invention. This invention is, therefore, directed to a useful 
liver protectant composition comprising a phosphoric 
diester compound of the following formula (wherein R₁ 
and R₂ are the same or different and each represents 
hydrogen or methyl) (hereinafter referred to as the 
present compound) or a pharmacologically acceptable 
salt thereof. 
The present compound for use in the liver 
protectant composition of this invention can be 
synthesized by, for example, the processes described in 
Japanese Patent Publication H-2-44478 or Japanese 
Patent Publication H-5-23274, or any improvement 
thereof. The compound for use in the liver protectant 
composition of this invention is already known to be  
 
useful as an anticataract agent, a prophylactic and 
therapeutic agent for climacteric disturbance, a skin 
care cosmetic ingredient (Japanese Patent Publication 
H-2-44478), an antiinflammatory agent (Japanese Patent 
Publication H-1-27004), an antiulcer agent (Japanese 
Patent Application Kokai S-63-270626) and a 
prophylactic and therapeutic agent for ischemic organic 
impairment (Japanese Patent Application Kokai H-2-111722), 
among others. However, it is not yet reported that these 
compounds are of value as active liver protectants. The compound for use in the liver protectant 
composition of this invention may be a free compound or 
a pharmacologically acceptable salt. Thus, whichever 
of them can be used for the prevention and the 
treatment of various liver disorders. The
