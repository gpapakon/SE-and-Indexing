<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to adenosine derivatives
having A2 agonist activity and the use thereof in
therapy.Adenosine is known to modulate a number of physiological
functions. At the cardiovascular system level,
adenosine is a strong vasodilator and a cardiac depressor.
On central nervous system, adenosine induces sedative,
anxiolytic and antiepileptic effects. At the
kidney level, it exerts a diphasic action, inducing vasoconstriction
at low concentrations and vasodilatation
at high doses. Adenosine acts as a lipolysis inhibitor
on fat cells and as an antiaggregant on platelets
(Stone T.W., Purine receptors and their pharmacological
roles. In: Advances in drug research. Academic Press
Limited, 1989, 18, 291-429; Progress Cardiovasc. Dis.
1989, 32, 73-97).A number of studies showed adenosine actions are
mediated by two subtypes of receptors which are located
on the cell membrane: an high-affinity one, inhibiting
the activity of the enzyme adenylate cyclase (A1
receptor), and a low-affinity one, stimulating the
activity of the same enzyme (A2 receptor). (J. Med.
Chem. 1982, 25, 197-207. Physiol. Rev. 1990, 70(3),
761-845. J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 407-422). Both receptors
are widely spread in the different systems of the
organism. In some tissues, however, only one of said
receptors is mainly present. For example, A1 receptor
is prevailing at the cardiac level, whereas the A2
receptor is present mainly at the vascular level and 
on platelets.Therefore, it is clear that compounds capable of
interacting selectively with the A2 receptor could have
an interesting pharmacological pattern. In fact, the
vasodilating activity, together with the antiaggregating
action, can lead to useful therapeutical applications
in the treatment of severe cardiovascular pathologies
, such as ischemic cardiopathy, hypertension and
atherosclerosis.Moreover, due to the actions on central nervous
system, the use of A2 selective medicaments can be envisaged
in the treatment of cerebrovascular ischemia,
epilepsy and various emotional disorders, such as
anxiety and psychosis.The prototypical compound having activity on the
A2 receptor is adenosine-5'-N-ethyluronamide or NECA
(Mol. Pharmacol., 1986, 25, 331-336). On the other
hand, NECA is also active on the A1 receptor and therefore
it lacks selectivity for the adenosine receptors.
Being the only available compound having A2 affinity,
NECA was used for pharmacological tests for the
receptor binding. Only recently, the use of NECA as a
prototypical A2 agonist has been gradually quit
