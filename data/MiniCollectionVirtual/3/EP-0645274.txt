<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a filler head (cap) for a motor vehicle fuel tank filler pipe, of the sort including a bowl-shaped body (12), the upper face (16, 20) of which has a filler opening (24) and a shut-off flap (30) mounted so that it can pivot with respect to the bowl (12) between a position of rest towards which it is returned elastically and in which it closes off the filler opening (24) and a position in which it is retracted inside the bowl (12), in which position the filler opening (24) is free and towards which it is driven when a filler nozzle is inserted into the filler opening (24), characterised in that it includes means (76, 96) for automatically locking the shut-off flap (30) in the position of rest, these means including a rotor (110) for unlocking it, mounted so that it can rotate between a locking position and an unlocking position.

Filling head for a motor vehicle fuel tank filler pipe, of the 
type having a body in the shape of a bowl (12), the top face (16, 20) 

of which has a filling orifice (24), and a closure flap (30) mounted 
so as to pivot with respect to the bowl (12) between an idle position 

to which it is returned elastically and in which it closes off the 
filling orifice (24), and a retracted position inside the bowl (12) 

in which the filling orifice (24) is left clear and towards which it 
is driven when a filling nozzle (150) is inserted in the filling 

orifice (24), having means (76, 96) for automatically locking the 
closure flap (30) in the idle position, including a rotor (110) for 

controlling unlocking and mounted so as to rotate between a locking 
position and an unlocking position, the closure flap (30) being 

returned elastically in abutment against a seat (28) formed around 
the filling orifice (24), the locking means including at least one 

locking finger (96) mounted so as to be able to move between a 
locking position towards which it is forced elastically and in which 

it extends opposite a portion of the bottom face (36) of the flap, 
and an unlocking position in which it is retracted laterally whilst 

being recessed with respect to the said portion of the bottom face 
(32) of the closure flap, and the rotor (110) for controlling 

unlocking controlling the movements of the locking finger (96) 
counter to elastic means (100) which act on it, characterised in that 

the locking finger (96) is arranged in the central part (94) of a 
locking arm (76), a first end (78) of which is mounted so as to be 

articulated, with respect to the bowl (12), about a spindle (80) 
perpendicular to the top face of the bowl (12), which surrounds the 

lateral edge of the closure flap (30), and the second end (90) of 
which has a control surface (92) able to cooperate with a control cam 

(124) rotatably connected with the control rotor (110). 
Filling head according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
control rotor (110) is mounted so as to rotate about an axis 

perpendicular to the pivot axis of the closure flap.  
 
Filling head according to Claim 2, characterised in that the axis 
of rotation of the rotor (110) is perpendicular to the top face of 

the bowl (12). 
Filling head according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the control cam (124) is formed on the lateral wall of a 

control drum (120) rotatably connected with the control rotor (110). 
Filling head according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
control drum (12) is mounted so as to rotate with respect to the 

control rotor (110), and in that provision is made for rotational 
coupling means (116, 118, 119) between the drum (120) and the control 

rotor (110) which allow a relative angular movement between these two 
components. 
Filling head according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
rotor (110) has a radial coupling lug (118) which extends in an 

aperture (119) in the shape of a cylindrical sector which is formed 
in the control drum (120) and the angle of which determines the value 

of the said angular movement. 
Filling head according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the flap (30) has a stop element (132), a 

lateral face (140) of which cooperates with the said control surface 
(92) of the locking arm (76) carrying the locking finger (96) so as 

to hold the latter in the unlocked position when the closure flap 
(30) is in its retracted position and the drum (120) in the locking 

position. 
Filling head according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
control drum (120) is adjacent to the pivot pin (62, 64) of the 

closure flap (30), and in that the stop element is formed on a stop 
arm (132) which extends below the bottom face (32) of the closure 

flap (30) and which has a stop surface (140) which cooperates with 
the said control surface (92). 
Filling head according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
control surface (92) is formed on an
 extension (91) of the locking  
 

arm (76) which extends parallel to the articulation spindle (80) of 
the locking arm (76). 
Filling head according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the control cam (124) is elastically returned 

towards its locking position and in that means are provided for 
temporarily immobilising the cam (124) in the unlocking position, 

which are carried by the locking arms (76, 92). 
Filling head according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the control rotor is fixed with respect to 

rotation to the barrel of a lock controlling the unlocking. 
Filling head according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the control rotor is fixed with respect to 

rotation to a knob controlling the unlocking. 
Filling head according to one of Claims 11 or 12, characterised 
in that it has means (122) of elastically returning the drum into the 

locking position. 
Filling head according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the top face of the bowl consists of a cover 

(16) in which the filling orifice (24) is formed, and in that the 
closure flap (30) is articulated on the bottom face (18) of the cover 

(16). 
Filling head according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it has symmetry of design on each side of a 

mid-plane perpendicular to the pivot axis (X-X) of the closure flap 
(30).
