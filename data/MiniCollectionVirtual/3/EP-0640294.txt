<ABSTRACT>
A process of treating a fermented protein koji prepared 
from a protein containing material and a carbohydrate, for 

the production of a seasoning, which comprises hydrolysing 
the fermented protein koji at a temperature of from 2° to 

25°C and a pH of from 4.5 to 10 for a period of from 6 
hours to 28 days, adding salt and yeast to the hydrolysed 

fermented koji to form a moromi and fermenting the moromi.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a seasoning, more particularly to the
production of seasoning by the biological hydrolysis of
protein containing material.Hydrolysed proteins have been known for use as seasonings
in food systems for centuries in the Far East in the form
of soya sauce which traditionally has been prepared by
enzymatic hydrolysis requiring a long period of time,
usually several months, for preparation. In producing soya
sauce, plant protein containing materials such as cooked
soya beans or defatted soya flour together with
carbohydrates are inoculated with Aspergilli and the solid
culture is fermented for 2 days to make fermented koji
during which time enzymes are produced which are able to
hydrolyse protein and carbohydrates in the moromi stage.
The fermented koji is mixed with a solution of common salt
to give moromi which is fermented for 4 to 8 months by the
activity of micro-organisms such as soya lactic acid
bacteria and soya yeasts from which the soya sauce is
obtained by removing the solids portion from the fermented
moromi.About 100 years ago, a more rapid method of hydrolysing
proteins for producing seasonings was developed using
hydrochloric acid in which the time required is only a few
hours. However, in recent years, the use of acid hydrolysed
plant protein (HPP) in culinary applications has been under
criticism due to the presence of some chloro-compounds
which arises from the acid process. Therefore, attempts
have been made to develop HPP replacements which can be
used as body-givers in culinary applications. Soya sauce is
one such suitable replacement. However, owing to the
differences in the raw materials and the processing methods 
involved, the two products, HPP and soya sauce, have some
differences in terms of chemical composition and flavour
profile. Dosage of soya sauce which can be used as an HPP
replacement is limited due to its "fermented" note. The
different processing procedures also result in a
significant variation in the degree of hydrolysis of the
protein containing material to the amino acids. Soya sauce
has a lower amino acid content than HPP and this leads to a
significantly weaker body in soya sauce than in HPP.We have developed a process for the production of a
seasoning based on modified standard soya sauce technology
in which the fermented koji is treated, before forming the
moromi, by a low temperature hydrolysis whereby the
resultant seasoning has a stronger body than a standard
soya sauce. A similar hydrolysis during

<CLAIMS>
A process for treating a fermented protein koji prepared
from a protein containing material and a carbohydrate, for

the production of a seasoning, which comprises hydrolysing
the fermented protein koji in the substantial or complete

absence of salt at a temperature of from 2° to 20°C and a
pH of from 4.5 to 10 for a period of from 12 hours to 28

days.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the protein
containing material is a plant protein material.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the protein
containing material is cooked.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the protein
containing material is used in particulate form for

enabling the mould of Aspergillus oryzae and/or
Aspergillus sojae to grow on the surface of the particles

and eventually penetrate the particles.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the hydrolysis of
the koji is carried out with constant agitation.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the fermented
protein koji is hydrolysed by mixing with from 1 to 5

parts of water per part by weight of fermented koji.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the fermented koji
is hydrolysed at a temperature from 2 to 20°C for a period

of from 12 hours to 25 days. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein, after the
hydrolysis of the fermented koji, salt is added to the

hydrolysed fermented koji to form a moromi and the moromi
is fermented to give a seasoning.
