<ABSTRACT>
A process and device for incubating samples (7) in fluids (5) for subsequent polymerisation embedding in capsules, the samples (7) being introduced into perforated capsules (2') open at the top and having in the lower third of their cylindrical wall at least one ring of apertures (6) which are smaller than the diameter of the samples (7). The samples (7) are incubated in a fluid (5) extending above these apertures (6). The perforated capsules (2') are then fitted into shell capsules (3) of larger diameter and also preferably with a cylindrical wall, and a fluid (5) (a polymerising monomer additive) in the shell capsules (3) at least fills the gap (S) between the perforated capsule (2') and the shell capsule (3) and this fluid (5) is finally polymerised under the effect of u/v radiation or heat. The perforated (2') and shell (3) capsules can be successively placed on plugs (4') on a support (1).
