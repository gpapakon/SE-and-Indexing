<ABSTRACT>
In order to develop an upholstery element for only a few elastic, mattress-like rests, said upholstery element having a plurality of spring elements arranged in regular patterns on a base or a slatted frame (5), each having a spring body (10; 20; 25; 30), a foot part (11.1; 21.1; 26.1; 31.1) fixed by attachment means, and a top part (11.2; 21.2; 26.2; 31.2) with a support plate (11; 24; 35) for placing a support (8) on, said support plates (11; 24; 35) almost completely covering the surface in its entirety in rows and gaps, in such a way that it can be joined together from simple and reproducibly manufacturable spring elements of different spring characteristics, so that adaptability to different conditions is possible with a simple construction, it is proposed that each spring element has a spring body (10; 20; 25; 30) between the foot part (11.1; 21.1; 26.1; 31.1;) and the top part (11.2; 21.2; 26.2; 31.2), which spring body is constructed as a plastic hollow profile section with at least one chamber and is provided with a support plate (11; 24; 35), said spring body being loaded with the force at right angles in a plane parallel to the support plates (11; 24; 35).

<CLAIMS>
Cushioning element (1), especially for sitting or
lying surfaces, with 
a frame (2.1, 2.2) having a number of
equidistant laths (5), each lath having
 a number of
regularly arranged spring elements, of which each has a

spring body (3
0
) located between the foot part (31.1) and
the head part (31.2) and taking the form of a hollow

profile section with at least one cavity, the foot part
(31.1) being fixed by means of fasteners to one of 
the

laths (5) and the head part (31.2) having support plates
(35) for the laying on of a cushioning means in the form

of a support (8), which support plates, in their totality
and apart from edge and corner spring elements, cover

almost the entire area of the cushioning element (1) in
rows and columns, the axes of the spring bodies 
(30)

being aligned in a plane parallel to the support plates
(35) and at right angles to the direction of 
the
 force
being applied and the spring elements - at least the

spring elements (3) - having the configuration of plastic
parts, characterised in that, as a means of fastening the

spring element to the lath (5), the foot part (31.1) has a
lath cavity (34) having an essentially rectangular cross-section,

each of the spring elements being adapted to be
pushed onto one of 
the
 lath
s
 (5), and that the support
plate (35) can be secured to the head of the spring body

(30) by means of clamp supports (40).
Cushioning element as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that inside the lath cavity (34) on the

wall facing the spring body (34), a fixing knot (34.1)
acting in conjunction with one of the laths (5) is

provided.
Cushioning element as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the cross-sectional shape of the

spring body (30) is semi-elliptical, with the foot part 
(31.1) being provided in the region of the short axis and

its tip, which is formed by the long axis, being flattened
to form the head part (31.2) which supports the support

plate (35).
Cushioning element as claimed in Claim 3,
characterised in that the side-walls (32) of the spring

bodies (30) have an indent (32.1) between the foot part
(31.1) and the head part (31.2), so that the cross-section

thereof adopts the shape of a figure "eight" which is open
in the centre, with lateral connectors (33.2) preferably

being provided, which inter-connect the two side-walls
(32) forming the two bulging arcs of the "eight" of the

spring body (30) on each of the two sides, the same being
centrally located and extending at least beyond part of

the length of the "eight" of the spring body (30).
Cushioning element as claimed in any one of Claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the spring body (30) has at

least one inner reinforcing web (33.1), such reinforcing
web(s) 
(33.1)
 running symmetrically to the plane of the
loading force.
Cushioning element as claimed in any one of Claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the axes of adjacent spring

bodies (30) run crosswise relative to each other.
Cushioning element as claimed in any one of Claims 3
to 6, characterised by a head clamp (40) with a bearing

plate (41) provided to fasten the support plates (35) on
the head part (31.2), which bearing plate is hinged to a

locking plate (43), both being provided with catch means
(42, 44) for locking in the closed condition.
Cushioning element as claimed in Claim 7,
characterised in that a foil hinge (45) is provided for

forming the hinged connection of the locking plate (43)
with the bearing plate (41). 
Cushioning element as claimed in Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the support plate (35) has a number

of openings in the region of the supporting surface of the
support (8).
