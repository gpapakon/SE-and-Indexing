<ABSTRACT>
Light from a bulb (34)is focused by an optical plate 
(24), having an array of convex lens surfaces (33), onto 

a corresponding array of triangular co-planar 
light-transmitting regions (31) on one side of a tail 

lamp transmitter/reflector outer lens (22). The same 
side has a complementary array of cube corner reflecting 

cells (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle tail lamps. A vehicle is required by law to have a tail lamp 
which provides a red light to the rear at night. 
Another legal requirement is a rear reflector which 
shines red when illuminated by the headlights of a 
following vehicle. A brake light is also required, and 
it is common for the rear lamp assembly on each side of 
the vehicle to have transparent areas corresponding to a 
tail lamp, a reflector, and a brake light, and possibly 
a reversing light, an indicator, and a fog lamp. In order to save space, it is known to incorporate 
the reflector into the tail lamp. That is, the light 
transmitting cover or lens of the tail lamp includes a 
reflector, in which case the cover can conveniently be 
termed a transmitter/reflector. Conventionally the 
light transmitting area is arranged directly behind a 
light bulb, and a reflecting area is provided in a 
region remote from the light beam from the bulb. 
However, it is also known(e.g from GB-A-1552 577) to 
provide the reflector in the form of strips extending 
across the light-transmitting area. In this case, an 
optical plate serving as a plurality of cylindrical 
convex lenses is required to ensure that the light from  
 
the bulb is concentrated onto the light-transmitting 
strips between the reflector strips. This type of tail 
lamp is shown in Figures 1 to 7 of the accompanying 
drawings. The known tail lamp comprises a light bulb 1 mounted 
in a housing 2 which carries a light transmitting (red) 
outer lens or cover 3 and an inner lens or optical plate 
4. The outer surface 6 of the cover 3 is substantially 
planar and the inner surface 7 has relatively wide 
light-transmitting strips 8 alternating with narrow 
reflecting strips 9 extending transversely. Each 
reflecting strip 9 consists of a row of cube corners 
11. Each intermediate light-transmitting strip 8 has 
concave grooves 12 for spreading the light coming from 
the bulb 1 via the optical plate 4. The optical plate 4 has a convex fresnel lens 
surface 13 facing the cover 3 and a series of 
cylindrico-convex lens surfaces facing the bulb 1. As 
can be seen from the optical diagram of Figure 7, the 
light from the bulb 1 is focussed onto the 
light-transmitting strips 8 of the cover 3 by way of the 
optical plate 4. The light-transmitting strips 8 result 
in undesirably localised bands of light. Also, the 
overall thickness of the cover 3 has to be sufficiently 
great to accommodate the grooves 12 whilst providing 
sufficient mechanical strength for the

A light transmitter/reflector for a vehicle tail 
lamp, comprising an outer lens (21) and an inner lens 

(24), characterised in that: 

(a) the outer lens (21) comprises a first sheet 
(22) of transparent material having a first, outer side 

(26) and a second, inner side (27) opposite and 
generally parallel to the outer side (26), the second, 

inner side (27) having a two-dimensional lattice of 
faceted cells (28; 36) which reflect light rays entering 

the first sheet (22) through the first, outer side (26) 
and having a complementary two-dimensional lattice of 

regions (31;38) which transmit light rays entering the 
first sheet (22) from either side; and 
(b) the inner lens (24) comprises a second sheet 
(24) of transparent material having a rear side which 

faces the first sheet (22) and a front side which is 
opposite to the rear side, one of the said sides of the 

second sheet (24) having a two-dimensional lattice of 
convex lens surfaces (33) which corresponds to the said 

lattice of light transmitting regions (31;38). 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in claim 1, 
in which the faceted cells (28;36) are arranged along 

mutually transverse axes, the spacing of the cells 
(28;36) along each axis being proportional to the 

dimension of each cell (28;36) along that axis. 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in claim 1 or 
 

2, in which each faceted cell (28; 36) comprises at least 
one cube corner (28;37). 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in claim 3, 
in which each faceted cell (28) is a single cube corner. 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4, in which the faceted cells (28) are 

arranged along three axes at 120Â°. 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 5, in which the faceted cells (28; 36) are in 

mutual contact. 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 6, in which the faceted cells (28) occupy a 

greater area of the second, inner side (27) of the first 
sheet than do the light transmitting regions (31). 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in any 
preceding claim, in which each light transmitting region 

(31;38) is planar. 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in claim 8, 
in which the light transmitting regions (31;38) are 

co-planar. 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in any 
preceding claim, in which the other of the said sides of 

the second sheet (24) has a convex fresnel lens surface 
(33). 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in any 
preceding claim, in which the said one of the sides of 

the second sheet (24) is the rear side. 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in any 
preceding claim, in which the first sheet (22) is 

delimited by a peripheral flange (23) which locates a 
peripheral portion of the inner lens (24). 
A transmitter/reflector as claimed in claim 12, 
in which the flange (23) serves as a spacer between the 

first and second sheets (22,24). 
A vehicle tail lamp comprising a 
transmitter/reflector according to any preceding claim.
