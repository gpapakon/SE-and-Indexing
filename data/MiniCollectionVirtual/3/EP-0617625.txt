<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF UDPG AS CANCER THERAPY RESCUE AGENTI. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to the oral an intravenous administration of Uridine Diphosphoglucos (UDPG) as a rescue agent in cancer therapy after th administration of pyrimidine inhibitors or antipyrimidin compounds known as anti-tumor compounds and relate compounds exhibiting similar activity with or without th administration of 5-benzylacyclouridine. II. Background of the InventionIn the field of anti-cancer chemotherapy it has bee known for more than 25 years that solid tumors ar amenable to treatment with antipyrimidine drugs i.e. pyrimidine inhibitors, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU o FU) . (Darnowski et al, "Tissue-specific Enhancement o Uridine Utilization and 5-fluorouracil Therapy in Mice b Benzylacyclouridine", Cancer Research Vol. 45, Novembe 1985, pg. 5364) . As discussed in The Pharmacologica Basis of Therapeutics (Goodman & Gilman 5th Ed. 1975) pgs. 1272-1277 the therapeutic effect of 5-FU does not exis with the drug per se but in its enzymatically produce metabolite 5-fluoro-2 '-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (F-dUMP) a nucleotide. This nucleotide has an unusually grea affinity for the enzyme thymidylate synthetase resultin in a decreased DNA synthesis. A second mechanism o action of 5-FU may involve the incorporation of 5-fluoro- uridine-5'-triphosphate into RNA leading to impaire processing of nuclear RNA. (Groeningen et al, "Reversal of 5-fluorouracil Induced Myelosuppression by Prolonged Administration of High-Dose Uridine", Reports. Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 81, No. 2, January 18, 1989, pg. 157). It has also been shown that 5-fluoro-2'- deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate (FdUTP) is incorporated in DNA. 5-FU and other related antipyrimidine chemicals used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents are toxic to cancer cells and normal healthy cells. Accordingly, the dose of antipyrimidine compounds 

 administered to patients undergoing cancer therapy is limited by the toxic effects exhibited by such compounds. It is also noted that the therapeutic index of such compounds, in general, is low. The low therapeutic index and-the toxicity associated with such drugs has provided motivation for increasing the anti-tumor activity of the antipyrimidine drugs and decreasing toxic effects to host tissue. Positive results with 5-FU have been achieved by combining this antipyrimidine with other anti-cancer agents, such as methotrexate and N-(phosphonacetyl)-L- aspartate, PALA. It has also been demonstrated that
