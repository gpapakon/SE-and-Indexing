<ABSTRACT>
A guide portion (G) is provided in a front edge of a 
disc cartridge in an insertion direction to a recording and 

reproducing apparatus. A slider (14) is slidingly engaged 
with the guide portion. A shutter (6)is fixed to the 

slider. Head insertion holes (5) and spindle holes (4) 
formed in the cartridge case are opened or closed by the 

shutter (6). A generation of friction or wear chips due to 
the sliding contact between the shutter (6) and cartridge 

(1) may be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc cartridge
according to the preamble of claim 1.In general, a magnetic disc or an optical disc is
encased in a cassette case made of two shell halves. A hole
into which a spindle for rotating the disc is to be inserted
is formed in a central portion of the cassette case. Head
insertion holes into which a write and read head is to be
inserted is formed in the cassette case so as to extend in
the radial direction to traverse the recording surface of
the disc.Such a disc cartridge is shown in, for example,
Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. 62-168176.
This cartridge has a shell for encasing the disc. A spindle
hole is formed in the central portion of the shell half. A
hub formed in the central portion of the disc is located in
the spindle hole of each shell half. The spindle of the
recording and reproducing apparatus is to be located at the
hub which is sucked by a turntable.The head insertion holes are formed on an insertion
side of the cartridge relative to the recording and
reproducing apparatus. A write and read head (pickup head)
is inserted into one of the head insertion holes. The head 
insertion holes are closed and opened by sliding movement of
the shutter.The shutter is bent at its intermediate portion so as
to extend to the top and bottom of the cartridge to cover
the head insertion holes and two spindle holes. On the
insertion side of the cartridge into the recording and
reproducing apparatus, the shutter is slidingly moved along
a guide portion of the cartridge front edge to open and
close the insertion holes and the spindle holes.However, it is general that the shutter is made of
metal, whereas the cartridge is made of plastic. Therefore,
when the shutter is frequently moved on and along the
cartridge, frictional or abraded chips are generated due to
the sliding movement between the metal and plastic. The
chips would enter through the openings of the cartridge into
the interior thereof to stick or adhere to the disc.Also, the sliding movement of the shutter of the
conventional cartridge is not smooth, which would lead non-smooth
sliding contact between the shell and the shutter.EP 0 250 111 discloses a cartridge for an optical disc for recording data on the two faces
thereof and an associated reading device. In particular a simple construction of the
cartridge is provided which enables the associated reading device to open the shutter of
said cartridge in opposite directions with only one single member.It is the object of the invention to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A disc cartridge comprising:

a cartridge case (1) for encasing therein a recording medium disc; and
a shutter (6) slidably mounted on said cartridge case for opening and closing a
head insertion hole (5) for reading the recording medium disc and a spindle hole

(4) into which a spindle for rotating the disc is inserted, said shutter (6) including a
head portion slidably movable along a front edge of the cartridge, said head

portion having opening and closing plate portions (11) extending from both sides
thereof, wherein
said cartridge case comprising upper and lower shell halves (2, 3), and
said head insertion hole (5) being formed continuously with said spindle hole
substantially in a radial direction, parts of a connection portion between said head

insertion hole (5) and said circular spindle hole (4) projecting toward an inner side
of the head insertion and spindle holes in the lateral direction in confronting

relation with each other to form two projections (80, 80) defined by an arcuate
side extending along a hub provided at centre of the disc and another side

extended from a side edge of said head insertion hole,
characterized in that
said head insertion hole (4) and said spindle hole (5) have chamfered peripheral
walls, each projection (80) being bevelled on its both surfaces at its distal end,

each of said projections having substantially a triangular shape defined by said 
arcuate side extending along the hub and a right angular side extending

perpendicular to a side edge of said head insertion hole.
The disc cartridge according to claim 1, wherein each shell half has a shallow
stepped portion for receiving a retainer plate (8) which guides a slide portion at a

lower end of each of the opening and closing plate portions (11), said retainer
plate being lowered in level from a surface of each shell half.
The disc cartridge according to claim 2, wherein a deep recess (84) is formed
along the shallow stepped portion, an extension portion of the retainer plate (8a)

being extended over the deep recess, said slide portion of the shutter being
located under the extension portion of the retainer plate.
The disc cartridge according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the opening and closing
portions (7b) of the shutter (6) are in the form of a barrel shape whose centre

portions (7b) are expanded outwardly.
The disc cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a distinction
indicating portion having a sand mesh surface (308) is provided on a side of the

cartridge case, and another distinction indicating portion having a number of
stripes (309) is provided on the opposite side of the cartridge case corresponding

to a portion of the one distinction indicating portion.
The disc cartridge according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein a write preventing
means (211) is provided in said cartridge.
The disc cartridge according to claim 6, wherein said write preventing means (9a,
9b) comprises at least one movable plug (211) for operating said write preventing

means, and a receiving portion (212, 213) provided in the cartridge case for
receiving movably said moveable plug (211) therein, said receiving portion having

a pair of openings on the upper and lower shell halves, at their positions opposite
to each other, respectively, said movable plug (211) being moved to open and

close the opposed openings. 
The disc cartridge according to claim 7, wherein said movable plug (211)
comprises a body (222), at least one retainer leg (225) projected flush with an

upper or lower surface of the body for engaging with a limiting projection for
limiting movement of the movable body.
The disc cartridge according to claim 8, wherein the body of the movable plug
(211) has further a pair of projections (220, 221) projected from upper and lower

surfaces for engaging with the openings formed on a cartridge case.
The disc cartridge according to claim 9, wherein one (221) of the projections is
provided with an insertion hole (223) for receiving a movable member for moving
