<ABSTRACT>
An improved grounding stud/nut sub-assembly for use in 
automobiles and the like is provided wherein the nut (32) 

has a thickened washer portion to facilitate assembly of the 
nut and washer together onto an automotive substrate (10). 

The nut (32) also has a swaged, flattened or distorted 
thread to make it a prevailing torque nut to hold the final 

assembly (28) securely in place, as well as to strip paint 
from the threads (36) of the stud (30) in an interim step 

during assembly. The stud (30) also has a washer portion 
(34) to achieve an appropriate stand off of the ground wire 

from the substrate (10) and to protect the weld gun collet 
from the heat of the welding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method and 
apparatus for providing an electrical ground (or earth) 
stud/nut combination for use in automobiles and other 
automotive vehicles. The need to ground (or earth) the 
electrical systems of automobiles and the like is well 
known. The invention provides a new and improved method and 
apparatus for accomplishing this goal during the manufacture 
of the vehicle. The invention also solves numerous problems 
in the Prior art in this field. The prior art provides numerous systems for providing 
such an electrical ground in automotive vehicles. The 
simplest system comprises the use of a self-tapping screw 
which is secured to a suitable location on the vehicle and 
which holds the ground wire to the vehicle. This method is 
highly susceptible to having the ground connection 
deteriorate with a resulting increase in electrical 
resistance, as well as shaking loose entirely during normal 
operation of the vehicle. An improved prior art system involves the use of a 
welded ground stud. Where welded ground studs are used, the 
welding is necessarily done before painting. Therefore, the 
washer portion and the threads of the stud become painted 
during the painting operation. It is necessary to protect 
the stud's washer and threads from the paint, or else to 
stip the paint off before using the ground stud as an 
electrical ground. If the paint were not stripped off, the 
paint would insulate the stud, thus totally destroying the 
electrical grounding function of the stud. Another prior art system includes parts which are 
thrown away, which is undesirable for many reasons including  
 
increased cost and environmental pollution. The present 
invention also solves these problems. Also, if a ground wire and nut were forced down the 
threads of a conventional fully painted stud, the wire would 
be insulated from the painted washer portion. While some 
paint would be stripped out of the threads by the nut, this 
stripped off paint could be pushed onto the washer, thus 
further obstructing the electrical grounding function of the 
stud. In addition, the stripped paint will likely produce a 
"soft" joint which may loosen as the paint erodes away. All 
of these prior art problems are solved by the present 
invention. Other prior art systems involve other means for 
stripping the paint from the welded stud's threads. This 
involves additional steps, additional labour, additional 
cost, delays, opportunities to damage the stud, 
opportunities to get stripped off paint on

1 A grounding stud/nut sub-assembly (28) adapted to be 
attached by welding to a substrate (10), characterised in 

that it comprises a stud (30) and a nut (32), said stud (30) 
comprising a head portion (42), a washer portion (34) and a 

threaded stud portion (36), said nut (32) comprising a 
washer portion (38) and means (44) to cause said nut to be 

of the prevailing torque type, said stud (30) and said nut 

(32) being formed of an electrically conductive material, 
and said stud washer portion (34) being relatively thin in 

relation to said nut washer portion (38). 
2 A grounding stud/nut sub-assembly according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that said means (44) to cause said nut to 

be of the prevailing torque type comprises a distorted 
thread in said nut (32). 
3 A grounding stud/nut sub-assembly according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that said distorted thread is a flattened 

outermost thread of said nut (32). 
4 A method of attaching a grounding stud/nut sub-assembly 
to a substrate characterised in that it comprises the steps 

of preassembling a prevailing torque nut (32) onto a stud 
(30) to form said grounding stud/nut assembly, welding said 

stud (30) of said sub-assembly to said substrate (10), 
painting said substrate (10) including said grounding 

stud/nut sub-assembly welded thereto, unthreading and 
removing said nut (32) from said stud 930) to thereby strip 

any paint which may be on the threads of said stud (30), 
mounting a ground wire terminal onto said stud (30) and 

 
replacing said nut (32) on said stud (30) to secure said 

ground wire terminal thereon. 
5 A method according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
said grounding stud/nut sub-assembly is welded to said 

substrate (10) using a drawn arc technique. 
6 A method according to Claim 4, characterised in that it 
further comprises the steps of providing a head portion (42) 

on said stud (30), using said head portion (42) in said 
welding step, providing a washer portion (34) on said stud 

(30) closely positioned to said head portion (42), providing 
a washer portion (38) on said nut (32) and proportioning the 

sizes of said stud washer portion (34) and said nut washer 
portion (38) so that said nut washer portion (38) is 

relatively thick as compared to said stud washer portion 
(34).
