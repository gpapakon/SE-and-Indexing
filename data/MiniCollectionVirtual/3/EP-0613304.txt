<ABSTRACT>
A scheme is provided for processing previous 
frame data in a motion compensated digital video 

system to interpolate pixels used in reconstructing 
a current video frame. Pixel data from a previous 

video frame is arranged into sub-blocks containing a 
plurality N of pixels. The sub-blocks are stored in 

a memory to enable the retrieval of at least one 
sub-block per memory access cycle. A plurality M of 

sub-blocks are retrieved from the memory in response 
to a displacement vector associated with a portion 

of a current video frame. M is less than or equal 
to N and the M sub-blocks are retrieved in no more 

than M memory access cycles. A subset of pixels is 
chosen from the selected plurality of sub-blocks for 

use in interpolating pixels for the current video 
frame portion. The subset of pixels is processed 

over no more than N memory access cycles to provide 
N interpolated pixels for the current video frame 

portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
compression of digital data, and more particularly
to a method and apparatus for interpolating pixels
in a motion compensated digital video system.Television signals are conventionally
transmitted in analog form according to various
standards adopted by particular countries. For
example, the United States has adopted the standards
of the National Television System Committee
("NTSC"). Most European countries have adopted
either PAL (Phase Alternating Line) or SECAM
standards.Digital transmission of television signals can
deliver video and audio services of much higher
quality than analog techniques. Digital
transmission schemes are particularly advantageous
for signals that are broadcast via a cable
television network or by satellite to cable
television affiliates and/or directly to home
satellite television receivers. It is expected that
digital television transmitter and receiver systems
will replace existing analog systems just as digital
compact discs have largely replaced analog
phonograph records in the audio industry.A substantial amount of digital data must be
transmitted in any digital television system. This 
is particularly true where high definition
television ("HDTV") is provided. In a digital
television system, a subscriber receives the digital
data stream via a receiver/descrambler that provides
video, audio, and data to the subscriber. In order
to most efficiently use the available radio
frequency spectrum, it is advantageous to compress
the digital television signals to minimize the
amount of data that must be transmitted.The video portion of a television signal
comprises a sequence of video "frames" that together
provide a moving picture. In digital television
systems, each line of a video frame is defined by a
sequence of digital data bits referred to as
"pixels". A large amount of data is required to
define each video frame of a television signal. For
example, 7.4 megabits of data is required to provide
one video frame at NTSC resolution. This assumes a
640 pixel by 480 line display is used with 8 bits of
intensity value for each of the primary colors red,
green, and blue. High definition television
requires substantially more data to provide each
video frame. In order to manage this amount of
data, particularly for HDTV applications, the data
must be compressed.Video compression techniques enable the
efficient transmission of digital video signals over 
conventional communication channels. Such
techniques use compression algorithms that take
