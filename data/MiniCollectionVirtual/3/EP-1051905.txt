<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fishing reels having a rotor with an associated bail
assembly for wrapping line onto a spool, and, more particularly, to a super-elastic,
lightweight bail wire in combination with the bail assembly.One well known style of fishing reel is the spinning-type fishing reel. A spinning
reel typically has a housing with an oscillating spool at its forward end. A rotor rotates
about the spool axis by cooperative movement of a crank handle and has an associated
bail assembly that wraps line onto the oscillating spool. In one construction, the rotor has
integrally formed ears at diametrically opposite locations that define a support for a pair
of bail arms between which a U-shaped bail wire is connected.The bail wire has three basic functions. One function involves converting the reel
from a cast mode to a retrieve mode as the bail assembly shifts from an open, line casting
position to a closed, line winding position. As the reel handle is turned the bail assembly
assumes the closed position and thereafter provides a smooth transition of line from the
edge of the bail wire over a line roller and onto the spool. Not much stiffness is required
of the bail wire to achieve this function.The second function also relates to the conversion from cast to retrieve mode and
is required when the bail assembly opening and closing systems are on opposite ears of 
the rotor. Usually in this case an over-center spring acts against one of the bail arms to
hold the bail assembly in the open position while a kick lever acts against the other bail
arm upon the initial rotation of the reel handle to trip the bail assembly to the closed
position. The bail wire serves to locate the two bail arms relative to each other, holding
the two bail arms in the same angular position and causing the entire bail assembly to
rotate as a single piece. Consequently, the bail wire must possess sufficient stiffness to
overcome the biasing force of the over-center spring.The third function of the bail wire involves the conversion from retrieve mode to
cast mode. Here, the bail wire acts as a handle or lever which the user grasps and pulls
in order to move the bail assembly into the open position. Sufficient stiffness must be
present m the bail wire not only to cause both bail arms to rotate to the open position but
also to resist overly rugged handling by the user.The bail wire is typically one of the most complicated, and most susceptible to
damage, components in a spinning reel. Damage generally occurs due to an accidental
loa
