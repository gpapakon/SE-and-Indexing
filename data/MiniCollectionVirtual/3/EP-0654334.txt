<ABSTRACT>
For continuously disaggregating thermoplastic waste containing fibrous and solid material, it is proposed to reduce the shredded waste during melting in a heatable vessel with dissolvers (high-speed stirrers), to divide the composition into a clear run with fine solids, which is discharged, and a residual fraction with coarse solids, which is returned into the melting vessel and is reduced again there.

A process for breaking down thermoplastic residue materials by
melting residue material scraps and crushing the solids joined thereto,

characterised in that the residue material scraps (12) are continuously
introduced into a melting boiler (1) and melted with agitation, the

solids are crushed by dissolver discs (2, 4) at different speeds of
rotation and the molten material is drawn off and separated in a

separation apparatus (8) into a residual fraction (7) with coarse
solids and a clear flow fraction (11) with fine solids, wherein the

residual fraction (7) is recycled to the melting boiler (1) and the
clear flow fraction (11) is continuously discharged and replaced by a

feed of residue material scraps (12) into the melting boiler (1).
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that when
starting up the pumpable mass is pumped around by way of a heat

exchanger (6) during the operation of introducing the residue material
scraps (12) into the melting boiler (1).
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in
that the molten mass is divided into two fractions (7, 11) by

filtration.
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to one of
claims 1 to 3 which has a heatable melting boiler (1) provided with

dissolver discs (2, 4) arranged on shafts, a filling level measuring
device (10) and filling and outlet connections, wherein the dissolver

discs (2) of the one shaft engage into the intermediate spaces between
the dissolver discs (4) of the other shaft, its outlet connection is

connected by way of a pump (5) to a separation apparatus (8) which is
provided with an outlet for the clear flow fraction (11) and another

for the residual fraction (7), wherein the outlet for the residual
fraction (7) is connected to the melting boiler (1) by way of a pump

(9). 
Apparatus according to claim 4 characterised in that a heat
exchanger (6) is disposed between the pump (5) and the separation

apparatus (8) and a by-pass to the melting boiler (1) is included for
by-passing the separation apparatus (8).
Apparatus according to claim 4 or claim 5 characterised in
that the spacing of the teeth of the dissolver discs (2) of the one

shaft is from 5 to 100 mm in relation to those of the dissolver discs
(4) of the other shaft.
