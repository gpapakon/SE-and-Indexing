<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a press for diecasting ceramic articles, especially tableware and the like, having press plates which can be moved with respect to one another along a shaft into the closed position, are arranged opposite one another, are respectively arranged on a carriage and can be moved along a guide which is parallel to the shaft there is provided, to perform the closing movement of the press, a crank drive which is driven by an electric motor and the connecting rod of which engages on a press plate, it being possible to move the other press plate by means of an adjusting spindle, and a short-stroke cylinder being provided between the adjustng spindle and the associated press plate in order to generate the closing force of the press.

<CLAIMS>
Press for injection moulding ceramic articles, particularly items of 
crockery and the like, including press plates (6, 7), which are arranged 

opposed to one another and are movable relative to one another into the 
closed position along an axis (19) and which are arranged on respective 

carriages (4, 5), which (4, 5) are movable along a guide (3) parallel to the 

axis (19), characterised in that provided for the closure movement of the 
press there is a crank assembly (8), which is driven by an electric motor 

and whose connecting rod (13) engages one press plate (6) and that the 
other press plate (7) is movable by a positioning spindle (15), a short 

stroke cylinder (17) for producing the closing force of the press being 
arranged between the positioning spindle (15) and the associated press 

plate (7). 
Press as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the press plate (6) 
connected to the crank assembly (8) is positioned in the closed position 

of the press by the extended position of the crank assembly, by means of 
which the press plate (6) is supported in the closed position with respect 

to the press frame or press stand. 
Press as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the short stroke 
cylinder (17) is fed from a pneumatic-hydraulic pressure convertor. 
Press as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that in  
 

each cycle the short stroke cylinder (17) is moved against an end stop. 
Press as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
positioning spindle (15) has a digital position indicator. 
Press as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
positioning spindle (15) is manually operable. 
Press as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
press has two opposed vertical stands (1, 2) which are connected together 

in the manner of a gantry by the carriage guide (3), that the two press 
plates (6, 7) are suspended on the two carriages (4, 5) and that the crank 

arrangement (8), the positioning spindle (15) and the short stroke 
cylinder (17) are aligned along an axis parallel to the guide (3).
