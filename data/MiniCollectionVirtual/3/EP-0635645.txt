<CLAIMS>
Dowel with an expanding member (5), which has a conical surface (6) and,
in the vicinity of its wider end, a shoulder (25) formed on the back surface

(7) of the expanding member (5), as well as with a dowel sleeve (1), which
in the vicinity of its end facing the expanding member (5) has an expanding

area (3) cooperating with its conical surface (6) and a construction which
can be engaged with the shoulder (25) in the expanded state for locking the

dowel.
Dowel according to claim 1, wherein the locking construction is formed
by a preferably circumferential projection (24), which on reaching the

shoulder (25) engages behind the latter.
Dowel according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the engagement
of the projection (24) behind the shoulder (25) can be brought about by

deforming the locking construction towards the end of the putting into
place of the dowel sleeve.
Dowel according to claim 3, wherein deformation takes place in a single
operation with the putting into place.
Dowel according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the expanding
member (5) is produced as a separate element and the dowel is supplied with

the expanding member (5) secured in the expanding area (3) of the dowel
sleeve (1).
Dowel according to one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein the dowel is constructed
in one piece and the expanding member (5) is connected to the dowel

sleeve (1) by means of a preset breaking point (14).
