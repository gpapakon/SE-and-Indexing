<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of aqueous coating compositions and the resultant coating compositions obtained by mixing an aqueous dispersion of one or more water-dispersible or water-soluble binders containing groups which are reactive towards isocyanate with one or more polyisocyanates which are liquid or have been liquefied by addition of organic solvents, and optionally pigments, fillers and/or additives which are conventional in paints (surface coatings), where an aqueous dispersion of one or more binders having a number average molecular weight (Mn) of from 1000 to 100,000, containing groups which are reactive towards isocyanates corresponding to an OH number of from 20 to 250 and having an acid number of from 10 to 100, at least some of whose acid functions have been neutralised by means of one or more polyamines containing primary and/or secondary amino groups mixed with one or more tertiary monoamines, is used and the polyisocyanate which is liquid or has been liquefied is dispersed in this dispersion just before the coating composition is processed.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing aqueous coating media by mixing an aqueous dispersion 
of one or more water-dispersible or water-soluble binder vehicles, which contain 

groups which are reactive towards isocyanate, with one or more liquid 
polyisocyanates or polyisocyanates which are present in liquid form due to the 

addition of organic solvents, and optionally with pigments, extenders and/or 
customary lacquer additives, 
characterised in that
 an aqueous dispersion is used 
of one or more binder vehicles which have a number average molecular weight 

(Mn) of 1000 to 100,000, which contain groups which are reactive towards 
isocyanate corresponding to an OH number of 20 to 250, and which have an acid 

number of 10 to 100, the acid functions of which are at least partially neutralised 
by one or more polyamines containing primary and/or secondary amino groups 

in admixture with one or more tertiary monoamines, and the liquid 
polyisocyanate or the polyisocyanate which is present in liquid form is dispersed 

in this dispersion shortly before processing the coating media. 
An aqueous coating medium, obtained by mixing an aqueous dispersion of one 
or more water-dispersible or water-soluble binder vehicles, which contain groups 

which are reactive towards isocyanate, with one or more liquid polyisocyanates 
or polyisocyanates which are present in liquid form due to the addition of organic 

solvents, and optionally with pigments, extenders and/or customary lacquer 
additives, wherein an aqueous dispersion is used of one or more binder vehicles 

which have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 1000 to 100,000 and 
which contain groups which are reactive towards isocyanate corresponding to an 

OH number of 20 to 250, and which have an acid number of 10 to 100, the acid 
functions of which are at least partially neutralised by one or more polyamines 

containing primary and/or secondary amino groups in admixture with one or 
more tertiary moncamines, and the liquid polyisocyanate or the polyisocyanate 

which is present in liquid form is dispersed in this dispersion shortly before 
processing the coating medium.  

 
A process or coating medium according to either one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that binder vehicles are used which have an acid number of 20 

to 60. 
A process or coating medium according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that binder vehicles are used which in addition to acid functions 

contain hydrophilic groups comprising 1 to 150 milliequivalents of ethylene oxide 
units per 100 g resin solids. 
A process or coating medium according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the polyamines used for neutralisation are employed in an 

amount of 5 to 25 milliequivalents and the tertiary monoamines are employed in 
an amount of 10 to 45 milliequivalents, with respect to 100 g solid resin in each 

case, wherein the absolute amount of milliequivalents of tertiary amine is greater 
than that of the polyamine in each case. 
The use of the aqueous coating media according to either one of claims 2 or 5 
for the production of multi-layer coatings. 
The use of the aqueous coating media according to either one of claims 2 or 5 
for the coating of temperature-sensitive substrates, with drying temperatures of 

25 to 80Â°C.
