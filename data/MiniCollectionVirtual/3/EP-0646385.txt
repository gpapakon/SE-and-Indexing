The powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting 
apparatus includes a gas feed pump (20); and a passage unit 

(50) having passages introducing gas fed from the gas feed 
pump (20) to a powdered medicament container (70) so as to mix 

the powdered medicament accommodated in the powdered 
medicament container (70) with the gas, introducing a powdered 

medicament-mixed gas from the powdered medicament container 
(70) to a nozzle (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powdered
medicament-mixed gas injecting apparatus and a powdered
medicament-mixed gas injecting nozzle for injecting
powdered, for example, hemostatic powdered medicament to an
affected part, for example, in the body.When tissue of a specified portion in the body
are picked up, for example, for tissue examination, there
may occur bleeding at the pick-up portion. In such a case,
it has been conventional practice to leave the bleeding as
it is, without stopping blood, so that the bleeding will be
naturally cured. While, there have been reported examples
in which hemostatic powdered medicament are injected to the
affected part by using a powder-feeding apparatus which is
described below.The powder-feeding apparatus is described with
reference to Fig. 13. As shown in Fig. 13, this powder-feeding
apparatus 5 is formed into a pistol shape provided 
with a compressed air supply source 3 and a lever 1a. The
powder-feeding apparatus 5 comprises a regulator 1 which is
connected to the compressed air supply source 3, for
example, via a rubber tube and which regulates the
transmission of compressed air fed from the compressed air
supply source 3 by the way how to pull the lever 1a, and a
medicament feed tube 2 which is connected to the regulator
1 and which serves to feed medicament to an affected part
in the body. In such the powder-feeding apparatus,
powdered medicament or the like is first charged within the
medicament feed tube 2. Then the medicament feed tube 2 is
connected to the regulator 1. By operating the lever 1a to
transmit the compressed air from the regulator 1, the
powdered medicament or the like within the chemicals feed
tube 2 is injected to the affected part together with the
compressed air.There are also available such types of apparatus
that a small-size gas cylinder is used as the compressed
air supply source so that the overall size of the apparatus
is reduced smaller than the above powder-feeding apparatus
5.Some of the above-described conventional powder-feeding
apparatus are those simply designed to push out
medicament contained in the tube with air fed to the tube,
while others are those having the structure, formation, and 
operation similar to those of, for example, painting-use
sprayers to be used for applying paints. Accordingly, in
a powder-feeding apparatus of such a type that the
medicament within the tube are pushed out with air, too
small amount of medicament charged in the tube would make
it less expected for patients to have effective medical

<CLAIMS>
A powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting apparatus (100)
characterized by a passage unit (50) removably fitted in a recess

(16) in which recess an insertion hole (17) and a supplying gas inlet hole
(17a) are accomodated, the passage unit (50) comprises:


a first passage (57) having at one end thereof a
gas supply opening for supplying gas;
a second passage (55) having at one end thereof
a container-fitting end portion (53) for fitting thereto a

container opening of a powdered medicament container (70)
in which powdered medicament is accommodated and which has

one end closed and the other end provided with the
container opening, the other end of the second passage (55)

being coupled with the other end of the first passage (57), the
second passage (55) serving for introducing supply gas fed from

the gas supply opening of the first passage (57) to the powdered
medicament container (70) and besides for introducing powdered

medicament-mixed gas which has been formed by mixing the
supply gas with the powdered medicament, in a direction

opposite to a direction in which the supply gas is fed, and
the second passage (55) allowing gas to pass bidirectionally

therethrough; and
a third passage (59) having one end thereof
coupled with a coupling portion at which the respective

other ends of the first and second passages (57,55) are coupled
with each other, where the third passage (59) is branched from

the coupling portion, the third passage (59) having at the other 
end thereof a third passage opening (60) for jetting out

the powdered medicament-mixed gas to introducing the
powdered medicament-mixed gas.
The powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting apparatus
according to Claim 1, wherein among a first passage

sectional area, which is a sectional area of a cross
section of the first passage (57), a second passage sectional

area, which is a sectional area of a cross section of the
second passage (55), and a third passage inlet sectional area,

which is a sectional area of a cross section of the
coupling portion of the third passage (59), the third passage

inlet sectional area is the smallest.
The powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting apparatus
according to Claim 2, wherein among the first passage

sectional area, the second passage sectional area, and the
third passage inlet sectional area, the second passage

sectional area is the largest.
The powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting apparatus
according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, further comprising

a gas feed pump (20) connected to the gas supply opening of
the first passage (57) and serving for supplying gas.
The powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting apparatus
according to Claim 4, further comprising:


power supply (40) for supplying electric power to
the gas feed pump (20); and 
an illumination unit (30) for illuminating an

affected part to which the powdered medicament-mixed air
fed from the third passage opening (60) is to be injected,

wherein the illumination unit (30) will emit light with
electric power supplied from the power supply (40).
The powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting apparatus
according to Claim 5, wherein the first through third

passages (57,55,59) are formed in the passage unit (50) and the passage
unit is removable from a body (100) of the powdered

medicament-mixed gas injecting apparatus with which the gas
feed pump, the power supply, and the illumination unit are

provided.
A cylindrical powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting
nozzle (80) used to the powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting

apparatus (100) according to any one of Claim 1 to 6, one end of

other end thereof a flat plate (85b) extending in a
direction crossing a direction in which the cylindrical

powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting nozzle (80) extends,

wherein one end of a passage extending in the
cylindrical powdered medicament-mixed gas injecting nozzle

is connected to the third passage opening (60) and the other end
thereof is opened at the flat plate (85b) in order to inject the
