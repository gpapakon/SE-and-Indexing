<ABSTRACT>
Lateral guide device for heald frames in weaving looms, comprising 
a first section (3, 4, 5) permanently fixed to the loom structure (T) and 

a second section (11, 12) carrying the guide cheeks (2) for the heald 
frames (1), said second section being apt to slide in respect of the 

first section in a direction towards and away from the heald frame (1) 
and to be fixed to said first section by means of a fast locking jaw 

clamp (5), apt to be locked by way of a tie rod (8) operated by a cam 
lever (7). 
The device also comprises means (6, 14) to keep unvaried the angular 
positioning of the second section during its sliding movements, as 

well as adjustable stop means (15) to limit the movement of said second 
section in the direction towards the heald frames (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a lateral guide device for heald
frames of weaving looms, provided with a prompt locking and unlocking
system allowing a fast replacement or maintenance of the heald frames.As known, the heald frames of looms are supported and guided laterally
by guide devices in the form of sliding cheeks, fixed to the loom
structure, which keep unaltered the positioning of the frame in the required
vertical plane, while allowing its quick reciprocating movement in
said plane.Each time that - for weaving purposes - the heald frames have to be
replaced, or their number or positioning has to be varied, it is obviously
necessary to remove the aforementioned guide devices, so as to release
the frames from the sliding cheeks clamping their sides. In the presently
known guide devices for heald frames said operation is quite long, as it
requires the use of special tools to loosen the screw fixing means which
lock said devices in the wanted position. It takes just as long to reset
said devices to their prior position; resetting must in fact be carried
out at the end of the operations on the frames since, before tightening
the respective fixing means, it is necessary to make sure that the slack
between the cheeks of the guide device and the sides of the heald frames
is carefully maintained. A lateral guide device of the heald frames of the
known above cited type is for example the one disclosed in EP-524456.There is hence a highly felt requirement to dispose of guide devices
for heald frames, apt to be removed and reset in a prompt and precise
manner, while duly maintaining the prearranged slack between the cheeks
of the guide device and the sides of the heald frames, with no need for
any particular adjustment, so as to allow speeding up the operation of
maintenance of the heald frames at the start of each weaving operation.The present invention is apt to fully satisfy said requirement, by
providing a lateral guide device for heald frames - of the type comprising
at least one pair of guide cheeks, fixedly connected to a support 
which can in turn be fixed to the loom structure, said support
consisting of a first section permanently fixed to the loom and of a second
section, carrying said guide cheeks, apt to slide in respect of the first
section in a direction towards and away from the heald frame wherein said second section can be
fixed to said first section by means of a fast locking clamp, and said fast locking clamp is fixedly connected to one of said section of the device and is apt to grip

Lateral guide device for heald frames in weaving looms, of the type comprising at
least one pair of guide cheeks (2) fixedly connected to a support which can in turn

be fixed to the loom structure (T), said support consisting of a first section (3, 4, 5)
permanently fixed to the loom and of a second section (11, 12), carrying said guide

cheeks (2), apt to slide in respect of the first section in a direction towards and away
form the heald frame (1), characterized in that said second section can be fixed to

said first section by means of a fast locking clamp, and in that said fast locking
clamps is fixedly connected to one of said section of the device and is apt to grip

onto an anchor element (12) fixedly connected to the other section of the device.  
Lateral guide device as in claim 1), comprising also control
means (6, 14) to keep unvaried the reciprocal angular positioning of said

first and second sections during sliding of the second section in respect
of the first section.
Lateral guide device as in claim 1, wherein said fast locking clamp is a jaw
clamp (5) gripping onto said anchor element (12) by way of a tie rod (8) operated by

a cam lever (7).
Lateral guide device as in claim 3), wherein said jaw clamp (5)
has a cylindrical seat apt to house with slack, in an open position, said

anchor element (12) which is in the form of a cylindrical pin.
Lateral guide device as in claim 4), wherein said jaw clamp (5)
and said anchor element (12) form a sliding fit between said first and

second sections of the device when the clamp (5) is in an open position.
Lateral guide device as in claim 1), wherein adjustable stop
means are moreover provided to limit the movement of said second section

in the direction towards the heald frames (1).
Lateral guide device as in claims 5) and 6), wherein said adjustable
stop means consist of a self-locking ring nut (15), screwed onto

the free end of said cylindrical pin (12) and having a wider diameter
than that of the seat of said jaw clamp (5). 
Lateral guide device as in claims 2) and 5), wherein said
control means (6, 14) form a second sliding fit between said first and

second sections, to prevent any possible reciprocal rotation between the
same when the jaw clamp (5) is in an open position.
