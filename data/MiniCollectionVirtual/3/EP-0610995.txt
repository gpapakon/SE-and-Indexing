<ABSTRACT>
PLL frequency synthesizer suitable to carry out fast 
frequency hopping and to modulate directly the generated 

frequency. It includes broadband filtering means (LB) for 
the quick transition during the hop from one frequency to 

another, and narrow band filtering means (BS) for the 
operation conditions. 
The narrowband filtering means (BS) include: 

a sample and hold circuit (SH); 
a narrow band filter (RS); 
a buffer connected between said sample and hold 
circuit (SH) and said narrow band filter (RS).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a frequency 
sythesizer, and in particular to a device suitable to 
synthesize rapidly one or more assigned frequencies for 
applications in digital transmission systems of the 
commercial type, in particular for the use in cordless 
telephony systems (for example the DECT system) providing 
for the frequency hopping in the transmission of subsequent 
time slots of a same signal frame. For the rapid frequency synthesis the so-called 
"direct digital synthesizer" systems are known, but these 
are expensive and sophisticated so to be used only in 
special applications. Another solution generally proposed to obtain the 
rapid hopping from one frequency to another is that to use 
two separate alternatively switched PLL synthesizers and 
programming the next frequency on the one which is 
temporarily not in use. This system turns out to be less 
complicate from a constructive point of view, but it is 
more expensive, requiring a high energy drain in addition 
to the fact that it involves shielding problems in order to 
avoid leakage, which will consequently increase the cost 
and the weight. Therefore the synthesizer devices for the use in 
"consumer" type equipment are preferably of the type 
including a single circuit with phase locked feedback loop 
(PLL). The characteristics generally requested to this type 
of synthesizer are a high locking speed to carry out 
rapidly the hopping from one frequency to the following  
 
one, a reasonable cost and a limited power drain, in 
particular in the case of application in portable sets. As 
an indication in a DECT system scheduling a time slot 
duration assigned to a subscriber of about 500 µsec the 
response time of the device on a new frequency must be less 
than 50 µsec. In addition to this from the moment that the 
synthesized signal must be afterwards modulated, the cutoff 
frequency of the feedback loop must be lower than the 
minimum modulating frequency if it is intended to modulate 
directly within the loop. In US-A 4 937 536 is disclosed a synthesizer circuit 
with phase locked loop where - during the transitory phase 
of hopping from one frequency to another - a loop filter 
with a high cutoff frequency and therefore with low time 
constant is used to obtain the rapid transition. Instead in 
the operation conditions a loop filter with low cutoff 
frequency is used and therefore with high time constant. In order to make the switching from the operation with 
the first loop to that with the second loop without
