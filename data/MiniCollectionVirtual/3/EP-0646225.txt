<DESCRIPTION>
 - 1 -VALVE WITH HA DLE LATCH/LOCKBackground of the InventionThe subject invention is directed toward the valve art and,, more particularly, to a valve having an operating handle assembly which can be latched and/or locked in selected positions of adjustment.The invention is particularly suited for use in ball valves and will be described with reference thereto; however, the invention is capable of broader application and could be embodied in a variety of different types of rotary valves.It is often desirable to provide valves with operating handles that can be latched and/or locked in selection positions of adjustment. Such locking handles are needed especially in critical processing systems where improper or unauthorized changing of valve settings could result in major problems.Many different locking valve handle arrangements have been proposed in the prior art. Typically, these prior art arrangements have comprised pivoted levers or mechanical arrangements which are somewhat awkward to use or require significant modification of the valve structure. Consequently, a need exists for an improved latching/locking valve and operating handle system.Brief Statement of the InventionIn accordance with the subject invention, there is provided a valve assembly which includes a valve body having a valve chamber with inlet and outlet ports connected therewith. A rotary valve element is mounted in the chamber for controlling flow between the inlet an outlet ports. An operating stem extends from the valv 

element to a position externally of the body, and a handle assembly is joined to the operating stem for rotating the stem between selected positions. The handle assembly includes a main handle body which defines a first guide slot extending transversely of the stem and a second guide slot extending generally in the direction of the stem. A first operating member is mounted for sliding movement in the first guide slot and a spring means acts to bias the first member in a first direction toward a first position. A second operating member carrying a downwardly extending latch pin adapted for selective engagement with the body is operatively mounted in the second guide slot for reciprocation therein. Cam means interconnect the first and second operating members such that movement of the first operating member in a direction opposite to the first direction towards a second position produces upward movement of the second operating member to disengage the latch pin from the valve body.Preferably, the first operating

<CLAIMS>
Having thus described the invention, it is claimed:
1. A valve assembly comprising: a valve body defining a valve chamber having inlet and outlet ports connected therewith; a rotary valve element mounted in said chamber for controlling flow between the inlet and outlet ports; a bonnet member; an operating stem extending from the valve element to a position externally of the body; a handle assembly joined to the operating stem for rotating the stem between selected positions, the assembly including a handle body defining a first guide slot extending transversely of the stem and a second guide slot extending generally in the direction of the stem, a first operating member mounted for sliding movement in the first guide slot, spring means biasing the first member in a first direction toward a first position, a second operating member carrying a downwardly extending latch pin adapted for selective engagement with the body, said second operating member being guided for sliding movement in the second slot and cam means interconnecting said first and second operating members such that movement of the first operating member in a direction opposite to the first directions toward a second position produces upward movement of the second operating member and the latch pin to disengage the latch pin from the valve body.
2. A valve assembly as defined in claim 1 wherein said valve body includes a bonnet member through which the stem extends, the bonnet member including openings for receiving the latch pin at selected positions of adjustment of the handle assembly. 


 3. A valve assembly as defined in claim l wherein the first operating member includes an end portion which is manually accessible from exteriorly of the handle body for moving the first operating member in a direction opposite the first direction.
4. A valve assembly as defined in claim 1 wherein the handle body includes a cover portion which overlies the first guide slot.
5. A valve assembly as defined in claim 1 wherein the handle body is releasably connected to the stem and wherein the first operating member includes means permitting it to be locked in the first position.
6. A valve assembly as defined in claim 5 wherein the first operating member includes a portion that extends out of the handle body when the first operating member is in the first position.
7. A valve assembly as defined in claim 6 wherein the second operating member includes a cam follower pin which extends into engagement with a cam surface on the first operating member.
