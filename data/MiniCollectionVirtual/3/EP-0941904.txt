<ABSTRACT>
Radio-based control of railroad train brakes is effected in
which brake systems are computer controlled. An End of Train

(EOT) system is used in which microprocessor circuits of a
Locomotive Control Unit (LCU)(12) and an EOT unit (14) are programmed to

perform these and other functions. The computer system has
several states. On power on, the system enters the Setup state

during which the system stores about one minutes worth of both
brake pipe (46) and equalizing reservoir (49) pressure data. This data is

later used to determine the rate of change of these pressures to
determine stability. Once setup is complete, the system enters

the Stability state during which operating pressures are
determined. When the equalizing reservoir pressure, the brake

pipe pressure and the brake pipe pressure at the end of the
train are stable, the EOT unit is commanded to update operating

pressures stored in its microprocessor control circuit. Once
the several pressures have been found to be stable, the system

goes to the Release state. The system makes transitions between
the Release state and the Stability state until a predetermined

decrease in brake pipe pressure is detected. At this point, the
system makes a transition to the Application state. In this

state, determinations are made as to whether to transmit brake
commands to the EOT unit from the LCU or to return to one of the

Stability or Release states. In any of these states, the system
can immediately enter the Emergency state to the Setup state,

if setup has not been completed, or to the Release state if
setup has been completed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to implementing
radio-based Electro-Pneumatic (EP) control of railroad train
brakes and, more particularly, to computer control of railroad
train brake systems including establishing operating pressures,
generating and responding to brake commands, and monitoring and
analyzing pressure gradients.Radio controlled remote brake systems for a railway train
having a caboose equipped with a motor driven pressure
regulating valve are known in the art. An example of one such
system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,056,286 to Burkett
which is assigned to the assignee of the present application.
In that system, when a brake application is made at the
locomotive by operating the engineer's brake valve device, a
radio signal corresponding to the brake valve position is
transmitted to the caboose where it is compared with a feedback
signal corresponding to the instantaneous position in which the
caboose regulating valve is set by its drive motor. The
comparison is done digitally in a digital servo mechanism to
control a stepping motor that operates the valve. End of Train (EOT) signaling and monitoring equipment is
now widely used, in place of cabooses, to meet operating and
safety requirements of railroads. The information monitored by
the EOT unit typically includes the air pressure of the brake
line, battery condition, warning light operation, and train
movement. This information is transmitted to the crew in the
locomotive by a battery powered telemetry transmitter.The original EOT telemetry systems were one-way systems;
that is, data was periodically transmitted from the EOT unit to
the Locomotive Control Unit or LCU (sometimes called the Head of
Train [HOT] unit) in the locomotive where the information was
displayed. More recently, two-way systems have been introduced
wherein transmissions are made by the LCU to the EOT unit. In
one specific application, the EOT unit controls an emergency air
valve in the brake line which can be controlled by a
transmission from the LCU. In a one-way system, emergency
application of the brakes starts at the locomotive and
progresses along the brake pipe to the end of the train. This
process can take significant time in a long train, and if there
is a restriction in the brake pipe, the brakes beyond the
restriction may not be actuated. With a two-way system,
emergency braking can be initiated at the end of the train
independently of the initiation of emergency braking at the head 
of the train, and the process or brake application can
