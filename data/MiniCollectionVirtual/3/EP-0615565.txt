<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanism for delivering stock in papermaking 
machines and more specifically to a headbox and forming zone 
arrangement for delivering a controlled flow of stock toa forming zone. Developments in the papermaking field relative to delivering a jet of 
stock from a pressure headbox to a forming zone have included 
improvements, such as turning bars over which the wires are trained, 
vanes in the headbox and bladed forming zone arrangements which tend 
to eliminate the need for a free jet of stock. The headbox and former 
become a single unit with the ability to totally control the activity of the 
approached flow of stock without free surface instability. Limitations to 
the development of sheet quality, particularly where multiple layers are 
required, exist in the free jet which has heretofore been controlled by a 
profiling bar or slice lip. In multiple layered paper, good layer purity has been limited by the 
control restrictions to permit a headbox jet to pass through free air until it 
has been placed under control by the forming zone. Excess activity of the 
free jet causes the jet to break up. The need for a protruding slice bar 
causes discharge vortexes which generate layer mixing.  
 The prior art includes so-called roll formers, such as described and 
shown in FR-A-2 014 192. In roll formers, only one forming wire is 
utilized, and it is guided onto the foraminous surface of the forming roll by 
a curved shoe which may be in the form of a suction box. There is no 
second forming wire, and there are no structural elements, such as the 
elongated bridging elements of this invention, which, in combination with 
the turning bars, permit both forming wires to be turned into a converging 
throat while preventing the stock jet stream surface from being exposed to 
air. An object of the invention is to provide an improved stock delivery 
apparatus and method for delivery of a stock jet from a pressure headbox 
to a forming zone which is particularly well adapted to the formation of 
multi-layered paper and achieves improved layer purity. A further object of the invention is to provide an improved 
arrangement in a papermaking machine which eliminates the need for a free 
jet between the headbox and the traveling wires. To achieve this, the mechanism for delivering 
stock of the invention is characterized by the 
features claimed in the characterizing part of claim 1. The arrangement of the invention eliminates the need for free jet 
surfaces and the disturbance of

<CLAIMS>
A mechanism for delivering stock to a dewatering web forming 
zone, including a pressure headbox (10) for containing stock, a narrowing 

slice opening (21), opposed traveling foraminous forming surfaces 
comprising twin looped forming wires (11,12) providing a throat (13) in 

substantial alignment with the slice opening (21), characterized in that: 

means (22,23) are disposed outside the looped forming wires in 
opposed array for bridging the spaces between the slice 

opening and the forming surfaces on the forming wires 
(11,12) so that a stock jet is contained in movement from the 

slice opening to the forming surfaces absent a free surface of 
the stock; 
a control means (26,27,27a) for controlling the space between said 
forming surfaces in the throat (13), the control means 

including a flexible trailing slice lip (26) structured and 
arranged to control cross-machine weight profile and in 

engagement with the underside of one of the opposed 
traveling forming surfaces (12). 
A mechanism as set forth in claim 1, further 
characterized in that: 


a turning bar (14,15) is mounted within each of the looped traveling 
forming wires (11,12); 
the trailing flexible slice iip (26) is mounted on one of said turning 
bars (15) and is in engagement with the inside surface of one 

of the looped forming wires (12) with means (27a) for 
adjusting the force of said slice lip against the wire to control 

the throat opening (21) and cross-machine weight profile. 
A mechanism for delivering stock as set 
forth in claim 1, characterized in that 


the flexible trailing slice lip (26) is in 
engagement with the inside surface of one of said looped 

forming wires (12) and extends in a cross-machine 
direction, 
a plurality of elongate rods (27) extending 
parallel to each other and in engagement with the 

flexible trailing slice lip (26), and individually 
adjustabe (27a) to control the local deflection of the 

trailing slice lip (26).
