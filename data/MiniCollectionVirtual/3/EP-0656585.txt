<ABSTRACT>
An imaging apparatus using a reusable software architecture 
implemented in to significantly cut development time and costs while 

providing flexibility for implementation of a wide variety of imaging 
apparatus. An imaging apparatus in which software control is separated 

into discrete modules and in which many of the modules may be reused 
in subsequent apparatus to create new imaging apparatus. An 

apparatus where software reuse is facilitated by the ability to remove a 
single module or a subtree consisting of many modules by breaking a 

single communication link. Software control is provided for a plurality 
of imaging products utilizing reusable software control modules. A 

method of providing software control for a plurality of imaging products 
is disclosed. Separate and independent software modules control input 

media, image retrieval, image placement, output media and the user 
interface. A separate product executive software module governs and 

synchronizes each of the separate and independent software control 
modules. Only the product executive software module needs to be 

unique for each separate new imaging apparatus. The product executive 
means has only one-way downward communication with each of the 

separate and independent software control modules. Preferably, all 
communication is transparent as provided by a remote procedure call. 

There is no direct communication between each of the separate and 
independent software control modules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to imaging apparatus 
and, more particularly, to imaging apparatus having process driven 
software control architecture and methods for providing software 
control for imaging apparatus. One area in which imaging apparatus are utilized is in the area 
of handling engineering drawings. Such imaging apparatus utilize 
network printers, blackline copiers, card film plotters, quantimatic 
printers, duplicators and camera stations. The core technology 
involved with engineering drawing imaging apparatus is the precise, 
high speed reproduction of large format drawings ranging from 8.5 
inches (21.6 centimeters) by 11 inches (27.9 centimeters) to 34 
inches (85.4 centimeters) by 44 inches (111.8 centimeters). 
Typically, the large format drawings are manipulated as digital images 
or micrographic reductions. Examples of apparatus are large format 
digital network printers, blackline copiers, card film plotters, 
quantimatic printers, duplicators and camera stations. Modern imaging equipment typically contains different 
hardware control components which are controlled by software. As 
an example, a microfilm card reader performs the function of handling 
microfilm cards that are used as input media for the imaging 
apparatus. The process steps that the microfilm card reader performs 
are controlled by software. Software commands control the individual 
operations of the reader. A software command typically tells the  
 
reader to move and stop the microfilm card, set the exposure of lamp 
brightness, sets power mode, performs diagnostics, eject the 
microfilm card, etc. Imaging apparatus conventionally provides input media control, 
image retrieval, output media control, image placement and a user 
interface. Often the software control of one function is dependent 
upon the results or status of another function. For example, the 
image retrieval function is dependent upon the input media control to 
properly input and position a microfilm card before the image can be 
extracted from the microfilm card. Similarly, the output media cannot 
properly generate and output the output media, such as a print, 
before the image placement function has completed the task of 
properly placing the image onto the output media. Often a new imaging apparatus must be designed to perform a 
particular imaging function involved in the handling of engineering size 
drawings. A new imaging apparatus may use a different form of input 
media control, image retrieval, image placement or output
