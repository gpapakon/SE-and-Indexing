<ABSTRACT>
A wrapping for containing liquid products of differing 
viscosity is described, comprising: a sachet (2) of thermoÂ­

plastic material bordered by walls, one of which is heat 
sealed after a suitably shaped pad (1) of porous material 

has been inserted in the sachet (2) and soaked in liquid, in 
order to close the sachet (2) hermetically; one wall (3) of 

notable thickness, containing in one corner a cavity (4) 
which concerns a part very close to the external surface of 

the wall (3); a tearing indicator notch (5) which is developed 
on a plane transversally intersecting the wall (3) thereby 

dividing it into two parts: the first part of which is manually 
removable; the second containing that part of the cavity (4) 

which assumes the form of a pouring spout (4a).

<DESCRIPTION>

WRAPPING FOR CONTAINING LIQUID PRODUCTS OF DIFFERING
VISCOSITY
The invention refers to a wrapping for containing liquid products of differing viscosity, that is to a wrapping of the type comprising a sachet of thermo-plastic material, hermetically closed by means of heat sealing, enclosed in which is a pad which can be soaked with various types of products, such as medicinal products, foodstuffs, cosmetics, lubricants, detergents, etc.


All the known wrappings of the above-mentioned type generally contain a single dose of the pre-selected liquid products since, once open, they do not guarantee a hermetic seal and it is thus necessary for the contents to be used completely or transferred to another suitable container after the opening of the said wrapping, which serves to contain the liquid during transportation or warehouse storage.


Among the various uses of the known types of these wrappings, is one for which the pouring operation of the liquid into the container does not require particular care; if, in fact, a container is used which has a notably sized opening, such as a bucket, a basin or similar then there is no risk of wasting the liquid by spilling it outside the container; there are, however, certain uses of the known type of these wrappings for which the pouring operation of the liquid into the container requires particular care; this is the case when containers with a small opening are used, such as small  bottles or ampoules, and when the quantity of the liquid must be carefully measured to a pre-determined value, as in the case of medicinal products or cosmetics;
 in this case it is easy to waste the liquid either by spilling it outside the container or, if the container remains open, from inside the said container, the liquid losing its effectiveness.


There are also wrappings with measuring spouts which make it easier to pour the product thereby preventing waste through spillage outside the container or due to incorrect dosage. The spouts of this type consist of extensions of the wrappings turned outwards, these being exposed to the danger of breakage or unwanted opening should the wrapping receive a blow or be dropped. They are also exposed to receive particles of dust or other substances in the air which can pollute the liquid when poured out.


This invention is aimed at overcoming these difficulties.


As characterised in the claim, the invention solves the problem of creating a wrapping for containing liquid products of differing viscosity and which makes it possible to transfer

CLAIMS



1. Wrapping for containing liquid products of differing
 viscosity, preferably comprising a dose of a liquid pro

 duct, for example a medicinal product, foodstuff, cos
 metic, detergent or similar, comprising at least a

 sachet (2) of thermo-plastic material bordered by a pre
 determined number of walls,in which sachet (2) a suit

 ably shaped pad (1) is hermetically enclosed by means of
 heat sealing along any one of the said walls, the said

 pad (1) preferably consisting of'synthetic porous ma
 terial to absorb the product which is introduced into

 the wrapping, characterised by the fact that the said
 sachet (2) comprises one wall (3) which has a greater

 thickness with respect to the thickness of the other
 walls and in which a cusp-shaped cavity (4) is cut, con

 cerning one corner of the said wall (3) but not the
 other walls of the said sachet (2); 


 the said cavity (4)
 being extended to a part of the wall (3) very near to

 the external surface of the said wall (3) and housing a
 part of the said pad (1); a tearing indicator notch (5)

 being cut into the said wall (3) and being developed
 along a plane transversally intersecting the wall (3)

 dividing it into two parts; the first part being manually
 removable; the second containing that part of the said

 cavity (4) which, having removed the first part, remains
 in the wrapping assuming the form of a spout (4a) thereby

 making it easier to pour the liquid from the wrapping
 into a suitable container.
