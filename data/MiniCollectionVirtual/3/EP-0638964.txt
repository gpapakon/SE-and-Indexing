<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical connectors and, 
more particularly, to a system for connecting electrical 
connectors to each other on a mounting track. U.S. Patents 3,576,520 and 4,090,764 disclose mounting of 
electrical connectors to mounting tracks or channels. U.S. 
Patent 4,157,858 discloses a support section bar for 
supporting a terminal block. The following U.S. Patents 
disclose various different systems for connecting 
electrical connectors to each other: 4,993,967; 5,015,199; 
4,370,013; 4,787,860; and 4,946,404. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention 
an electrical connection system is provided comprising a 
mounting track, a first electrical connector, and a second 
electrical connector. The mounting track has means for 
connecting the track to a frame. The first electrical 
connector has means for directly mechanically connecting to 
the mounting track. The second electrical connector has 
means for directly mechanically connecting to the mounting 
track and, directly electrically connecting to the first 
electrical connector. The system allows the first and 
second electrical connectors to be physically connected to 
the frame through the mounting track such that movement of 
the connectors relative to the frame can be restrained.  In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention an electrical connection system is provided 
comprising a mounting track and a first electrical 
connector. The mounting track is connected to a frame. 
The first electrical connector is mechanically connected on 
the mounting track. The mounting track also includes means 
for mechanically connecting a second electrical connector 
thereon such that the second electrical connector 
mechanically and electrically connects with the first 
electrical connector. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention in an electrical connection system for connecting 
a first electrical connector to a second electrical 
connector an improvement is provided comprising a mounting 
track. The mounting track has means for mechanically 
independently connecting the connectors on the track and 
means for mechanically connecting the track to a frame. 
The connectors are mechanically connected to the frame by 
the mounting track thereby preventing unintentional 
movement of the connectors relative to the frame, and 
connection of the first and second connectors onto the 
track electrically connects the connectors to each other. The foregoing aspects and other features of
