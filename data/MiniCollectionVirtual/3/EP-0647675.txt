rubber and (B) 45 to 80% by weight of a natural

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber
composition for a base or sub-tread and a tyre using
the rubber composition. More specifically it
relates to a tyre tread of a two-layer structure,
which not only achieves saving of fuel consumption
but also makes for reduced deformation of an
extruded tread during manufacture of tyres and
assures uniformity after vulcanisation, and a rubber
composition for a base tread used for a base portion
of a tread of the tyre.In recent years, demands for saving of resources and
energy have been increasing throughout the world.
In the course of developments of tyres for cars and
electric cars with smaller energy loss and decreased
fuel consumption, various studies have been made
specifically in relation to tyre tread structures
and rubber materials used for the tread.For instance, there are proposed ideas to save fuel
consumption, such as using a tread of a two-layered
structure comprising a cap portion and a base
portion instead of a tread of a conventional one-layer 
structure provided with a fuel saving rubber
as the base portion of the tread (JP-B-12244/1985,
JP-B-45961/1988 and JP-B-33361/1989), and a styrenebutadiene
co-polymer rubber (JP-A-100112/1982 and
JP-A-179212/1982) which is obtained by solution
polymerisation in an organic solvent with the use of
organolithium compound as a catalyst being used for
the cap portion of the above-mentioned tread.Furthermore, in another idea for saving fuel
consumption which has also been proposed, a rubber
composition prepared by blending a small amount of a
carbon black as a reinforcing material in a rubber
such as a natural rubber, synthesised isoprene
rubber and butadiene rubber is used for the base
position of the tread having the above-mentioned
two-layer structure.Certainly the problems in the tyres having a
conventional one-layer structure, such as high
rolling resistance and a low grip characteristic,
are solved and fuel saving can be achieved to a
considerable extent in the cases of the above-mentioned
fuel saving tyres employing fuel saving
rubbers for the base portion, styrene-butadiene
copolymer rubber for the cap portion of the tread, 
and a rubber composition prepared by blending a
small amount of a carbon black in a rubber such as a
natural rubber, synthesised isoprene rubber and
butadiene rubber used for the base portion of the
tread. However, contrarily there is a problem in
that uniformity of the overall shape of the tyres
becomes remarkably worse mainly due to non-uniformity
of the base tread

structure of a cap portion and a base portion

wherein the rubber composition for the base tread
portion is characterised by blending, per 100 parts

natural rubber containing a diene rubber other than

a star shaped solution-polymerised rubber in an
amount of not more than 50% by weight, and the tan 6

value of the rubber of the base tread portion is
smaller than the tan Î´ value of the rubber of the

cap tread portion.
