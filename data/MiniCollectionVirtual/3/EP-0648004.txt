<ABSTRACT>
An AC power supply system, in which an AC power supply 
is constituted by an uninterruptible power supply (51) 

for converting AC power supplied from an input AC power 
source into stable AC power, another AC power supply (1) 

is obtained from the input AC power supply, and power 
can be supplied from either of said AC power supplies to 

a load through a switcher. The AC power supply system 
also comprises means (54,56) which, when a fault occurs 

while power is supplied from said one AC power supply 
(51) to the load (8), stops power supply to the load, 

and causes said other AC power supply (1) to temporarily 
supply power to the load, means (29,57) which determine 

whether the fault is caused by an internal factor of 
said one power supply or by an external factor thereof; 

and means (27,28) which, when it is determined that the 
fault is caused by the external factor, restart said one 

AC power supply so as to switch a current power supply 
operation to a power supply operation from said one AC 

power supply.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power supply 
system for supplying a constant-voltage, 
constant-frequency output and, more particularly, to an 
uninterruptible power supply system having a protective 
function against output overcurrents. The inventors have proposed an uninterruptible power 
supply system of an overcurrent protective scheme 
including two overcurrent detecting elements, i.e., a 
detecting element for detecting an overcurrent output 
from an inverter so as to protect internal components of 
the system, and a detecting element for detecting a 
load-side overcurrent due to an external factor such as 
an abnormal state of the load. Since both the elements 
are required to have high-speed detection functions, it 
is difficult to control their protective functions. The inventors have proposed that the overcurrent 
detection level of an inverter output should generally 
be set to be higher than that of a load current. 
However, the waveform of a load current is changed due 
to an AC filter arranged in the circuit. Owing to 
recent high-speed switching elements, the inverter 
control technique has been rapidly improved. However, 
if waveform improvement control is performed to cause  
 
the waveform of an output voltage from the inverter to 
approximate to a sine wave, a peak value of an inverter 
output current becomes much higher than that of a load 
current depending on a type of load. As a result, the 
inverter output overcurrent detecting function for 
protecting the internal components of the system is 
operated in response to an overcurrent caused by a 
load-side factor, thus stopping the uninterruptible 
power supply system. If the difference between the overcurrent detection 
level of an inverter output and that of a load current 
is increased to solve the above-described problem, the 
operating efficiency of a semiconductor element of the 
inverter is degraded, and the system is increased in 
cost. It is accordingly an object of the present invention 
to provide a power supply system having a protective 
function which can satisfactorily protect the system 
against overcurrents without degrading the reliability 
of the system. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided an AC power supply system, 
characterized in that at least one AC power supply is 
constituted by an uninterruptible power supply for 
converting AC power supplied from an input AC power  
 
source into stable AC power, another AC power supply is 
obtained from the input AC power supply,
