<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal
composite (hereinafter referred to as a PDLC composite) and, more
particularly, to a PDLC composite based on an electron-rich alkene-thiol
polymer which is radiation curable and can be cast into a thin
film.PDLC composite systems are typically thin films composed of
droplets of liquid crystals dispersed in a polymeric matrix. PDLC
composite systems are of interest because they can be switched
between an opaque state (light scattering) and a transparent state
(light transmitting) by the application of a suitable electric or
magnetic field, or by a significant change in temperature. A
composite with these properties is possible because the liquid
crystal is birefringent. It possesses two refractive index values:
one value when the molecules comprising each droplet are randomly
oriented, and a different value when the molecular axes of the
molecules are aligned with respect to each other. Alignment of the
axes occurs when a voltage, magnetic field, or significant change in
temperature is applied to the PDLC composite. The liquid crystal and
polymeric matrix are chosen so that the refractive indices of these
two components match when the magnetic field, electric field or
temperature is significantly varied, thus resulting in a transparent 
material. When the refractive indices of the polymer matrix and the
LC are not identical or nearly identical, the dispersed LC droplets
act to scatter light and an opaque material results.PDLC composites are being used for, among other things, light
valves, filters, shutters, electro-optic switches, information
display arrangements (like the LCD watch), switchable windows and
projection television.Various polymer matrices for PDLC systems have been proposed.
For example, U.S. Patent 4,728,547 issued to Vaz et al. discloses an
optically responsive film comprising liquid crystals dispersed in a
UV-curable ene-thiol, particularly thiol-allyl, polymer matrix.
Suitable polymers are based on the reaction product of triallylisocyanurate
and/or other suitable di- and tri-allyl ethers or esters
and one or more polythiols and a photoinitiator such as benzophenone.U.S. Patent 4,869,847 issued to Leslie et al. discloses a
polymer matrix for liquid crystal technology based on monomers
derived from acrylic acid and methacrylic acid such as acrylates and
methacrylates. Similarly, U.S. Patent 5,011,624 issued to Yamagishi
et al. discloses the use of three classes of acrylate monomers:
esters derived from acrylic acid, esters
