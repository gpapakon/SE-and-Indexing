<ABSTRACT>
A spatial positioning system includes fixed referent stations (101, 102 or 103) which emit rotating, divergent laser beams (130) and a portable reflector (200). Each fixed station also includes a detector (330) and a processor (120). The portable reflector may include retroreflectors or transponders (340). When the rotation of the laser beam is such that it is in line with a portable reflector, the transmitted laser beam is reflected off the portable reflector and received at the fixed receiver. For any point which is crossed by the fanned laser beams of a fixed station, a horizontal angle can be determined. Once these horizontal angles are known for three fixed stations, the point of intersection of three planes, and thus the three-dimensional position of the point, is determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spatial positioning and
measurement system and, more particularly, to a spatial positioning and
measurement system which provides three-dimensional position and/or
measurement information of an object using one or more fixed referent
station systems, and one or more portable position sensor systems.US Patent Specification No. 4,709,580 describes a system for
determining the attitude and rate of rotation of a moving object, such
as a satellite. According to this specification, an object such as a
satellite is provided with at least one retroreflective attitude
marker having a predetermined plane of retroreflection, one or more
laser illuminator/receivers are directed towards the satellite, and the
timing of retroreflective pulses is determined in order to establish
the attitude and spin rate of the satellite. The purpose of the
system is to assist in the recovery or stabilisation of a satellite
which has become disabled and is rotating or spinning in space as it is
orbiting the earth. By determining the attitude and spin rate of the
disabled satellite, there is provided the possibility of stabilising
the satellite by possible actuation of control jets, for example, to
facilitate its continued use or recovery. The disclosure of this
patent specification relates solely to the determination of spin and
rate of rotation, and optionally other information relative to the
attitude and movement of the object rotating in space, and is not
directly pertinent to the field of the the present invention, which
addresses the determination of the position of an object. US Patent Specification No. 4,700,301 provides a method for
automatically steering a vehicle along a pre-programmed course by use
of a microprocessor. Lasers emitting a narrow beam of light are
positioned at two reference points around the area to be traversed by
the vehicle, such as a field. An all-directional light detector is
mounted on top of the vehicle. A bi-directional light detector with a
radio transmitter to transmit a detected signal to the vehicle is
located at a third fixed location. Laser light reflected from the
vehicle detector and sensed by the bi-directional detector at the third
reference location initiates counts by a microprocessor corresponding
to the times of the events. From these counts, the vehicle's position
in the field is computed. By comparing the vehicle's present position
with its past position, the direction of motion is computed. Further
processing enables a desired direction of motion
