<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for automatically mounting and/or demounting flexible printing plates on printing machines. Setting out from the object of compensating the phase offset of the impression lines relative to the leading edge of the sheet and the leading edge of the printing plate during automatic mounting and/or demounting of printing plates over the sheet path, at least one gripper system is designed to be movable in relation to the sheet-conveying and/or printing plate-conveying apparatus for compensating the phase offset of the impression lines relative to the leading edge of the printing plate and the leading edge of the sheet in a device for automatically mounting and/or demounting flexible printing plates on/from at least one printing forme cylinder of a printing machine provided with a plate gripper system by sheet conveying means, present on the printing machine and containing sheet-conveying cylinders fitted with gripper systems, and an intermediate cylinder provided with an auxiliary gripper system.

Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates (4) 
onto or from at least one print cylinder (8) equipped with a plate gripper system (9) and 

forming part of a printing press by means of the sheet feeding mechanism already 
present on the printing press and comprising a sheet guide roller (13;14) equipped with a 

gripper system (5) and by means of an intermediate roller (6) equipped with an auxiliary 
gripper system (7) thereby characterised that at least one cylinder (14;6;8) is designed to 

be movable to compensate for phase displacement (p) of the print application lines (19) 
in relation to the leading edge of the printing plate (4.1) and the leading edge of the 

sheet (18.1) relative to the direction of advance of the sheet and/or printing plate. 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 thereby characterised that the auxiliary gripper system (7) 

incorporated in the intermediate roller (6) is capable of being displaced to an extent 
equivalent to the phase displacement (p) of the print insertion lines (19) in relation to the 

printing plate leading edge (4.1) and the sheet leading edge (18.1) along the direction of 
printing plate advance and that the print cylinder (14) is designed to be capable of 

displacement to an extent equivalent to the phase displacement (p). 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 thereby characterised that the plate gripper system (9) on the print 

cylinder is designed to travel radially as far as and below the print cylinder periphery 
(27) of the print cylinder (8) and the intermediate cylinder (6) is capable of movement to 

an extent equivalent to the phase displacement (p) along the direction of printing plate 
advance.  

 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 thereby characterised that the auxiliary gripper system (7) on the 

intermediate roller (6) is fitted with a pivoted drive link (33) capable of radial motion 
along the direction of plate advance and enabling the phase displacement (p) to be 

compensated along the direction of plate advance and motion to be transmitted to or 
from the plate gripper system (9) fitted below the print cylinder periphery (27) within 

the print cylinder (8). 
Device for the automatic introduction or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 thereby characterised that the plate gripper system (9) on the print 

cylinder (8) can be moved in the print cylinder channel (17) in the direction of printing 
plate advance along a track radial to the print cylinder. 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in Claim 1 above thereby characterised that the plate gripper system (9) of the 

print cylinder (8) is capable of being moved within the print cylinder channel (17) to a 
point below the print cylinder periphery (27). 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in one of the above Claims thereby characterised that the gripper system 

(5;7;9) can be moved away in the normal direction of rotation when introducing flexible 
printing plates (4). 
Device for the automatic introduction and/or extraction of flexible printing plates as 
described in one of the above Claims thereby characterised that the gripper system 

(5;7;9) can be moved away in a direction counter to the normal direction of rotation 
when removing flexible printing plates (4).
