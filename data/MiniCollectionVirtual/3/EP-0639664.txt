<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to nylon fibers with improved dye washfastness 
and heat stability in particular it is directed to nylon fibers containing an 
additive such as water, an alcohol, or an amine and a heat stabilizer such as a 
phenolic compound or a phoshite containing aryl groups or mixtures thereof and 
a process for the manufacture thereof. Anionic acid dyeing of polyamide yarns involves the reaction of the amino end 
group of the nylon yarn with the sulfonic acid end group of the dye molecules. Depending on their chemical structure, the anionic dyes could possess a mono-, 
or a di-, or a tri-sulfonic acid end group. The reactivity of the dye with the 
fiber is directly proportional to the number of functional groups present in the 
dye and/or the fiber. Therefore, it follows that the greater the number of dye 
molecules that bond with the amine endgroups of the fiber, the better the 
washfastness of the fiber. Several applications involve treatment of heat to the fabric prior to dyeing. 
A typical example is the case of elastic fabrics which are knitted with 
elastomeric yarns, e.g. Lycra™ (DuPont, Wilmington) which imparts the stretch to 
the fabric. Heatsetting of the fabric prior to dyeing is essential to avoid 
curling of the fabric. Typical heat setting temperatures range between as low 
as 90°C to very severe temperatures of 200°C. When heat setting is conducted at 
elevated temperatures such as above 140°C, in air, oxidative degradation of the 
amino- endgroups occurs destroying the functional groups present in the fiber. 
This depletion of amino end groups reduces the affinity of the dye molecules to 
the fiber. Such a fabric picks up less dye than a non-heatset fabric, has a worse 
wash fastness and has a dull appearance. In more severe cases the preheatset-and-dyed  
 
fabrics also exhibit streaky appearance. Therefore, there exists a need to 
improve the resistance to thermal degradation of polyamide yarns so as to retain 
the brightness of the fabric, improve the washfastness of the fabric and improve 
the uniformity of the dyed fabric. To increase dye pick up of a heat set fabric, dyeing methods are modified. This 
involves increasing the temperature of the dye bath in some cases and/or reducing 
the pH of the dye bath, in many cases. Although, the modified dyeing procedure 
increases the affinity of the dye into the fiber, it is a temporary phenomenon, 
since after dyeing, the fabric is washed thoroughly to remove the acidity in the 
fabric. The dye molecules that are
