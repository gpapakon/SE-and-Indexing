<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a food grade gene 
integration and expression system in Streptococcus salivarius 
ssp. thermophilus. Maintenance and expression of any 
homologous and/or heterologous gene is selected for 
indirectly by simply growing the cells in their natural 
habitat, milk. Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (S. thermophilus) 
is a very important microorganism for the fermentation of 
food. It is predominantly used in the fermentation of milk 
products where it is particularly used as starter culture, 
often in combination with other homo- or heterofermentative 
bacteria, for yogurt and cheese production. Only recently, 
progress has been made in the genetics of this organism. 
Several gene transfer techniques as conjugation [1,2], 
transfection [3] and transformation [4,5] have been reported 
for this species. So far, this enabled the examination and 
use of already existing bacterial plasmids as cloning vectors 
[3,5] as well as a beginning in designing new vector systems 
[6]. Although very little is known about transcriptional and 
translational control regions in S. thermophilus [7], 
expression of some heterologous genes, delivered and 
maintained on plasmids, was reported [8]. However, expression 
levels are not predictable and often low or not detectable 
[7]. Plasmids are not a priori segregated in a stable way and may 
be lost under nonselective growth conditions. This may in 
particular be true for plasmid systems which are genetically 
engineered and carry heterologous DNA. Selection applied for 
ensuring plasmid maintenance make in most cases use of marker  
 
genes referring resistance to antibiotics. Although very 
convenient for laboratory scale experiments, such a selection 
system can not be applied in food production. Up to date, a 
food grade gene transfer system for S. thermophilus has not 
been reported. It was the object of the present invention to integrate a 
heterologous gene into a vital operon of the S. thermophilus 
genome in such a way to preserve the correct functioning, 
i.e. transcription and translation, of the operon and to have 
the heterologous gene as an integrative, functional part of 
the operon. In order to ensure correct expression of the 
integrated gene, it should be placed in front of an essential 
gene (cistron) of the same operon. Thus, selective pressure 
on the essential gene during cell growth under normal 
conditions in milk, ensures genetic maintenance and 
expression of the integrated gene. According to what operon 
is

<CLAIMS>
The Streptococcus thermophilus strain CNCM I-1190. 
A method for integrating a gene of homo-, heterogenic 
or artificial origin into the genome of S. 

thermophilus. 
The method of claim 2 where S. thermophilus is ST11. 
The method of claim 2 where genomic integration is 
into an operon in order to achieve expression of the 

gene to be integrated. 
The method of claim 4 where the mode of the 
integration maintains correct expression of a cistron 

(gene) of the same operon down-stream of the 
integration site. 
The method of claim 5 where the cistron down-stream 
the integration site codes for an essential gene-product, 

and, thus, ensures indirect selection for 
maintenance and expression of the integrated gene. 
The method of claim 4 where the operon is the lac 
operon. 
The method of claim 6 where the essential gene is the 
lacZ gene coding for Î²-galactosidase. 
The method of claim 2 where the gene to be integrated 
is a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene. 
A use of a Streptococcus thermophilus strain having a 
gene integrated in its genome according to any of the 

claims 1 to 9 in a process for manufacturing an 
acidified milk product, especially a yoghurt.
