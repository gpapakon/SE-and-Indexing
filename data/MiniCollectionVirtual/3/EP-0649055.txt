<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for replenishing a
developer in a rapid process and, particularly to a method for
replenishing a developer in a substantially smaller amount.A photographic plate-making process applicable with a
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material include,
for example, a step for converting a continuous tone original
into a halftone-dot image, that is a step for converting the
density variation of a continuous tone into an aggregate of
the halftone dots having an area proportionate to the above-mentioned
density; a step for converting the halftone dot
image obtained in the above-mentioned step into an halftone
dot image having an image sharpness more excellent than the
above-mentioned halftone dot image, that is, a contact step;
and so forth. A light-sensitive material applicable to the above-mentioned
steps has been regarded so far to be inevitable to
have a high contrast, because an excellent halftone dot image
is required to come out.As for the methods for obtaining the above-mentioned
characteristics, there has so far been such a known method as
the so-called lith development method, in which a light-sensitive
material comprising a silver chlorobromide emulsion
comprised of comparatively fine-grains (having a grain size of
the order of 0.2µ) having a narrow grain size distribution and
a high silver chloride content (at least not less than 50
mol%), such light-sensitive material is processed with an
alkali hydroquinone developer having a very low sulfurous acid
ion concentration.However, when making use of the above-mentioned method,
there is such a problem that preservability is seriously
deteriorated because the sulfurous acid ion concentration is
low in a developer, and that a development speed is too slow
to perform any rapid processing.It has accordingly been demanded for developing a novel
light-sensitive material from which a high contrast can be
obtained by processing it with a developer containing a super-additivity
type developing agent having an excellent
preservability and a rapid processing performance and also
containing a sulfite having a comparatively higher
concentration, that is so-called a PQ type developer 
(containing a developing agent comprising a 3-pyrazolidone
compound and dihydroxybenzene) or an MQ type developer
(containing a developing agent comprising an aminophenol
compound and dihydroxybenzene).As for the above-mentioned light-sensitive materials,
