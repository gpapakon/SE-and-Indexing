<ABSTRACT>
This liquid distributor makes it possible selectively to direct a flow of fluid to several outlet pipes. It includes at least one fluid inlet (2a, 2b, 2c) and at least two fluid outlets (3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e) which can be placed selectively in communication with the fluid inlet or inlets. Associated with the various fluid outlets (3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e) are solenoid valves (4) which are normally open and/or solenoid valves (5a, 5b, 5c) which are normally closed, all being direct-acting. Associated with the or each fluid inlet (2a, 2b, 2c) is a controlled valve (15, 18) designed to cut off the arrival (14, 17) of pressurised fluid upstream of this inlet, before selectively actuating the solenoid valves (4, 5a, 5b, 5c) associated with the fluid outlets. Application: water distributor or mixer for an electrical household appliance.

Liquid distributor operating with solenoid valves, constituting notably a water distributor
for a domestic electrical appliance such as a washing machine or dishwasher, having at least one

liquid inlet, and preferably at least two liquid inlets (2a, 2b, 2c), with which controlled valves (15,
18) are respectively associated, and at least two liquid outlets (3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e), characterised

in that: respectively normally open solenoid valves (4) and/or normally closed solenoid valves (5a,
5b, 5c) are associated with the liquid outlets, the liquid outlets thus being able to be put in

communication selectively with the liquid inlet or inlets, the controlled valve (15, 18), such as a
solenoid valve, associated with the or each liquid inlet (2a, 2b, 2c) being provided for cutting off

the liquid feed (14, 17) upstream of this inlet (2a, 2b, 2c) before selective actuation of the solenoid
valves (5, 5a, 5b, 5c) associated wi
th the liquid outlets (3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e); the solenoid valves
(4, 5a, 5b, 5c) associated with the liquid outlets (3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e) are all direct-action

solenoid valves; and a safety valve (9), preferably adjustable, is mounted on the body (1) of the
distributor in order to limit the liquid pressure inside the latter.
Liquid distributor according to Claim 1, characterised in that at least some of the liquid
outlets (3a, 3b, 3c) are equipped with flow regulators (6, 7, 8).
Liquid distributor according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that it comprises at least one
direct-action solenoid valve, notably a normally open solenoid valve (4), associated with a liquid

outlet (3), whose closure seal (20) has in it a small central hole (22), able to be closed off or left
free by a head (24) of the movable core (23) ofthe solenoid valve, so as to enable this solenoid

valve (4) to return to the idle position, notably under the effect of its return spring (21), even in
the case of high residual pressure inside the body (1) of the distributor.
Liquid distributor according to Claim 3, characterised in that the head (24) of the movable
core (23) ofthe direct-action solenoid valve (4) is held in a recess formed on the closure seal (20),

in the region of the aforementioned hole (22), at least one channel (25) being formed in the wall 
of the said recess in order to put this recess in communication with the inside of the body (1) of

the distributor.
