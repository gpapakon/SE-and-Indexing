<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to devices and to a method for damping out shocks as well as to a framework and to a vehicle including such shock-absorbing devices. The shock-absorbing device comprising at least one longitudinal element (110, 111) which, through deformation, absorbs energy generated by a shock occurring in a given direction, is characterised in that the said element consists of a thin plate, its section in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the shock having a triangular overall shape. Application especially to rail vehicles.

An impact-absorber device comprising a member (105, 106) which extends
in a longitudinal direction and which is capable of absorbing the energy

generated by an impact in said direction, the member being made from thin
plate, the device being characterized in that it comprises a first thin plate (16)

that is parallel to a second thin plate (17) extending in said longitudinal
direction, and in that it has a cross-section, in a plane perpendicular to said

longitudinal direction, in the shape of two triangles having parallel bases and
a common vertex, the base of the triangles being connected together via the

first and second thin plates.
The device according to claim 1, wherein said member has reinforcements
(11) in planes perpendicular to said direction.
The device according to claim 1 wherein said member has stamped areas
(14).

made of steel.
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein said cross-section
has parts with different yield stresses.
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein said member
comprises thin plates (5) bent and welded together to form said cross-section.
A vehicle comprising a chassis (25) and a safety cage (91) disposed at the
front of the chassis, the security cell including a framework having a front part

that includes a first deformable area (96) in the event of a frontal impact, said
first deformable area comprising a first impact-absorber device (97) according

to any one of claims 1 to 6 on either side of the central axis of the chassis,
said first impact-absorber device extending longitudinally parallel to said

central axis.
The vehicle according to claim 7, in which the framework of the safety cage
(91) comprises a rigid ring (89) fastened to the chassis and separated from

the first deformable area by a second deformable area (102) in the event of a 
frontal impact, said second deformable area (102) comprising second (106)

and third (105) impact-absorber devices according to any one of claims 1 to 6
on either side of the central axis of the chassis, the second and third impact-absorber

devices being disposed in a V-shape and being fastened together
by trapezoidal plates (107, 108), the second impact-absorber device

extending longitudinally parallel to the central axis of the chassis.
The vehicle according to claim 8, in which the chassis (25) comprises two
side sills (31, 32) parallel to the central axis of the chassis and separated from

each other by a beam (33) disposed at the rear of the safety cage (91), a
coupling bar (122) which passes through the first deformable area (96)

parallel to the central axis of the chassis, a longitudinal guide (121) which is
fastened to the chassis and to the safety cage and which extends parallel to

the central axis of the chassis, a longitudinal slider (120) having one end
fastened to the second deformable area (102) and another end that is

capable of sliding without deformation inside the longitudinal guide, the
coupling bar having one end engaged inside the longitudinal slider and

bearing against the beam by means of at least one impact-absorber device
(124) according to any one of claims 1 to 6 which extends longitudinally

parallel to the central axis of the chassis inside the guide or the slider
between said end of the coupling bar and the beam.
The vehicle according to claim 9, in which a plurality of impact-absorber
devices (124, 126, 128) are provided according to any one of claims 1 to 6,

disposed in series between said end of the coupling bar and the beam.
