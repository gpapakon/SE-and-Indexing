<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a selection marker free 
system which can be used to introduce genetic modifications 

in bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The system can be employed to 
introduce or delete desired genes or DNA fragments in the 

genome of the indicated host species without leaving any 
undesired DNA i.e. the selection marker used for selection of 

transformants or other DNA used for cloning. In this way 
strains have been developed containing only desired genes 

introduced at desired chromosomal sites. Similarly, desired 
DNA fragments have been deleted or replaced at desired sites.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention discloses selection marker gene
free recombinant filamentous fungal strains, a method for obtaining these
strains and the use of these strains. Furthermore, the method
of the present invention is used for performing strain
improvement.There is an increasing social concern about the use of
recombinant DNA technology. One of the promising application
areas of recombinant DNA technology is strain improvement.
Starting from the early days of fermentative production
processes there has been a demand for the improvement of the
productivity of the strains used for production.Classical strain improvement programs for industrially
employed microorganisms are primarily based on random
mutagenesis followed by selection. Mutagenesis methods have
been described extensively; they include the use of UV light,
NTG or EMS as mutagens. These methods have been described
extensively for example in "Biotechnology : a comprehensive
treatise in 8 vol." Volume I, Microbial fundamentals, Chapter
5b, Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Germany.Selection methods are generally developed around a
suitable assay and are of major importance in the
discrimination between wild type and mutant strains.It has turned out that these classical methods are
limited in their potential for improvement. Generally
speaking consecutive rounds of strain improvement yield
diminishing increases in yield of desired products. This is 
at least partially due to the random character of the
mutagenesis methods employed. Apart from desired mutations
these methods also give rise to mutations which are
undesirable and which may negatively influence other
characteristics of the strains.In view of these drawbacks it can be understood that
the use of recombinant DNA methods was hailed as a
considerable improvement. In general, recombinant DNA methods
used in strain improvement programs aim at the increased
expression of desired gene products.The gene products may be proteins that are of interest
themselves, on the other hand it is also possible that the
encoded gene products serve as regulatory proteins in the
synthesis of other products.Strains can be improved by introducing multiple copies
of desired protein encoding genes into specific host
organisms. However, it is also possible to increase
expression levels by introducing regulatory genes.Genes are introduced using vectors that serve as
vehicles for introduction of the genes. Such vectors may be
plasmids, cosmids or phages. The vector may be capable of
expression of the genes in which case
