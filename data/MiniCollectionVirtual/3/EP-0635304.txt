<ABSTRACT>
In a water-softening unit having an ion-exchanger container (15) and a device for the automatic regeneration of the ion-exchanger material (14) after each discharge of softened water, which device is provided with a vessel (22) containing concentrated regenerant, a pipe system and a cylinder chamber (5) having a spring-mounted reciprocating piston (7), the cylinder chamber being arranged in the pipe system in such a way that with the aid of the reciprocating piston, on the one hand a certain amount of regenerant solution can be metered off and transported, and on the other hand operational control valves (11, 12) in the discharge system from the ion-exchanger container can be actuated via a piston rod (9) joined to the reciprocating piston, at least one shut-off valve (10) in the pipe system for discharging regenerant from the regenerant vessel into the ion-exchanger container can also be actuated by the piston rod, the usable stroke volume when the reciprocating piston is displaced in the cylinder chamber is greater than or at least equal to the void volume of the ion-exchanger material inclusive of the dead volume situated beneath the ion-exchanger material in the ion-exchanger container and in the regeneration device, an apparatus for automatic defined dilution of the regenerant solution transported from the regenerant vessel to the ion-exchanger container is provided. As a result, the softening capacity of the ion exchanger required can be released with a minimum of used regenerant.
