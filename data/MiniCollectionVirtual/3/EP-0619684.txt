Method for forming administration order program
modules (APM) in a network management control

centre (NMZ) to which an operating device (BE) is
connected and which can be connected to

communication systems (KS) via a communication
network (KN) for the purposes of remote-controlled

administration,
characterized
in that
 the network management control centre
(NMZ) stores an operating task list (BAL),

representing different user tasks, including
associated, prepared administration program

modules (APM'), and
in that
 a retrieval routine (AFR) implemented
in the network management control centre (NMZ)

is used to select, under user interface
control, a user task (BA) from the user task

list (BAL) visualized on the operating device
(BE) and to retrieve, under user interface

control, operational parameters (p) which can
be prescribed by the user and also

order-specific information (ksi, afi, ati) for
the communi
cation systems (KS) to be
administered and to enter them into the

prepared administration program module (APM')
for the purposes of forming an administration

order program module (APM).
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the user tasks (BA), the order-specific
information (ksi, afi, ati) about the

communication systems (KS) to be administered and
the operational parameters (p) to be entered into.

the administration program modules (APM') are
respectively selected using the retrieval routine

(AFR) and by retrieval masks (BAM, KSM, PAM, AM)
routed to the user interface of the operating

device (BE) by means of inputs under user
interface control, the user guidance of the

retrieval masks (BAM, KSM, PAM, AM) being designed
such that the input effected under user interface

control is minimal.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized
in that
, when forming administration order
program modules (APM), the retrieval routine

(AFR) is used to retrieve, as one of the
order-specific information items,


a communication-system information item (ksi)
determining the communication system (KS) to

be administered,
an order information item (afi) defining the
respective user task, and
an order-type information item (ati)
determining the type of administration order

in each case and to store them in an order-book
file (ABD) and to store the associated

administration order program module (APM) in an
order file memory (AS) of the network

management control centre (NMZ), the order-book
file entry for an order management routine

(AVR) displaying the associated administration 
order program module (APM),
in that the order management routine (AVR) is
used to transmit the administration order

program modules (APM) to the communication
systems (KS) determined by the communication-system

information (ksi),
in that, in the communication systems (KS)
concerned, operational instructions (AMO) of

the administration order program modules (APM)
are supplied to the administration program

modules (KAVR, EMML) which interpret and
process operational instructions, and
in which the processing results are transmitted
to the network management control centre (NMZ)

via the communication network (KN) and are
stored.
Method according to Claim 3,
characterized

in that
, in the network management control centre
(NMZ), the order management routine (AVR) is used

to enter in the order-book file (ABD) a status
information item (SAI) displaying the processing

status of the administration order program modules
(APM).
Method according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterized

in that
 the order-type information item (ati) is
represented by


a time information item (zi) determining the
next possible transmission time of the

respective administration order program module
(APM), or by
a transmission-time information item (uzi)
determining the transmission time of the

respective administration order program module 
(APM), or by
an order-display information item (aai)
visualizing the current order information

(afi, ksi, ati) for a selected or a plurality
of administration order program modules (APM)

on a display device (AZE) of the operating
device (BE), or by
a deletion information item (li) deleting an
order, or by
an editing information item (edi) permitting
editing of the administration order program

module (APM) on the user interface, or by
an order-status information item (asi)
visualizing the current processing status of

the administration order program module (APM)
concerned on the user interface.
Method according to one of Claims 4 to 5,
characterized

in that
 the order-type, order and communication-system
information items (afi, ati, ksi) indicated

in an update message (ai) change the type of order
processing as a result of entry of the current

order-type information item (ati) into the order-book
file (ABD) or retrieve and visualize the

entered status information for an order (AU)
determined by the communication-system and order

information items (ksi, afi).
Method according to Claim 5,
characterized in that
, in the retrieval routine
(AFR),


a keyboard program module (TAM) controls the
user interface,
a text program module (TXM) routes prescribed
stored texts to the display device (AZE),
an auxiliary program module (HPM) routes 
auxiliary information informing and guiding the

user to the display device (AZE),
an editing program module (EDM) edits
administration order program modules (APM),
a data management program module (DWM) manages
the entered communication-system, order and

order-type information (ksi, afi, ati),
a user task program module (BAM) manages a list
(BAL) of available user tasks (BA),
a generating program module (AGM) generates
administration task program modules (APM), and
an order-book program module (ABM) enters and
reads the communication-system, order and

order-type information (ksi, afi, ati) in the
order-book file (ABD).
