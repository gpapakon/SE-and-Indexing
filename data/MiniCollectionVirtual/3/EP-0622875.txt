<ABSTRACT>
A substance vaporizing apparatus which uses a vapor (5) of a substance 
(4) generated by heating the substance in a gas-filled tube (2) as an 

exciting medium or an ionizing medium. The apparatus employs an improved 
container for containing the substance within the gas-filled 

tube (2). The improved container suppresses the rate of emission of the 
vapor of the substance into a discharge space (3) defined by the 

gas-filled 
tub
e (2) to hold the vapor density of the substance (4) at an optimum 
low value 

for laser oscillation relative to the buffer gas density in the discharge 
space (3). Thus, the mean free path of the atoms of the substance (4), 

namely the average distance traveled by the atoms between elastic 
collisions with the electrons, ions and neutral atoms of the buffer gas, 

is increased to increase the number of atoms of the substance (4) excited 
to 

a higher energy level, which, consequently, increases laser power and 
enhances laser beam or ion beam accelerating energy. The employment of 

segmental discharge electrodes (43,44) each consisting of a plurality of 
partial 

electrodes (43a,43b,43c,44a,44b,44c) diametrically distributed in the 
discharge space (3) of the 

gas-filled tube (2) enables heating the buffer gas in a substantially 
uniform diametrical temperature distribution, which enables to increase 

the length and diameter of the laser medium. The employment of two 
pulse generating circuits (200,300) promotes the relaxation of the atoms 

of the 
substance (4) from a lower energy level to the ground energy level to 

enable 
the next application of a pulse voltage to establish a complete population 

inversion, which enables the substance vaporizing apparatus to 
operate at a high efficiency at a high discharge frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substance vaporizing apparatus for generating a 
vapor of a substance for use as an excited, ionized medium in a 
vapor ion laser and wherein the vapor is generated by heating the substance in a 
gas-filled discharge tube defining a discharge space, and a pair of electrode means 
disposed axially opposite to each other within the discharge space to vaporize the 
substance by discharge.  
 Metal vapor laser and vapor ion laser incorporate such a 
substance vaporizing apparatus. Fig. 1 shows a conventional metal vapor 
laser as, for example, published in 6th Nenji Taikai Koen Yoko-shu, 
21aIIB3, pp. 60-63 (1986). As shown in Fig. 1, the metal vapor laser 
comprises discharge electrodes 1a and 1b, a cylindrical discharge tube 2 
defining a discharge space 3 in which a metal vapor 5 produced by 
vaporizing metal pieces 4, such as copper pieces, is excited, a heat 
shield 6 formed of a heat-insulating material, such as wool, resonant 
mirrors 7a and 7b for laser oscillation, flanges 8a and 8b defining a 
sealed space including a vacuum chamber 9, an insulating tube 10, a 
sealing tube 11, a gas inlet port 12a, and a gas outlet port 12b. In operation, a pulse voltage is applied across the electrodes la 
and 1b to form a discharge within the discharge space 3, and then a 
buffer gas filling the discharge space 3 is heated by the energy of  
 
accelerated ions and electrons to vaporize the metal pieces 4. The ions 
and electrons accelerated by a pulse discharge and having high energy 
and high-temperature atoms of the heated buffer gas collide with the 
atoms of the vaporized metal and transfer their energy 
, so that the atoms of the vaporized metal are excited 
to a higher energy level. The heat shield 6 serves for maintaining the 
gas at a desired temperature to maintain a predetermined vapor density 
in the discharge space 3. The function of the vacuum chamber 9 is 
similar to that of the heat shield; the vacuum chamber 9 suppresses 
particularly convection heat loss. Light is emitted when the energy 
level of the atoms of the vaporized metal drops to a lower energy level 
or the ground energy level. The light thus emitted is amplified optically by the resonant 
mirrors 7a and 7b to emit a laser beam outside for industrial uses, such 
as laser machining. Fig. 2 shows the buffer gas temperature distribution and the 
vapor density distribution with respect to the diametrical and axial 
directions of the discharge space 3 in the metal vapor laser thus 
constructed. In Fig. 2,

atoms of a lower energy level and electrons are brought into superelastic collisions 
so that relaxation of the vapor atoms from the lower energy level to the ground 

energy level is promoted.
