<ABSTRACT>
A box corner forming apparatus (10) is disclosed for forming non-rectangular 
corners on cigarette boxes (27) and the like. A plurality of 

wedge-shaped spacers (14, 16) defining a plurality of parallel-sided 
pockets (12) are arranged around a drying drum carousel (10) for 

receiving opposed walls of a partly formed box having projecting side 
flaps (44E). A pair of folding plates (42) are provided for folding down the 

side flaps along corner formations defined by parallel striations (45A) 
between the opposed walls and the side flaps so as to form corners 

(44F). Corner support means in the form of a pair of retractible wedge-shaped 
cheek plates (28, 28A) are mounted slidably on opposite sides of 

the corresponding wedge-shaped spacers for supporting and maintaining 
the shape of the corner as it is being formed. The invention extends to 

a method of forming rounded or chamfered corners for a box.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a corner forming apparatus and method, and
in particular to a corner forming apparatus and method for the forming
of corners in cigarette boxes.Nowadays, a number of cigarette boxes are manufactured with non-rectangular
chamfered or rounded corners. For the sake of a neat and
consistent appearance, it is important that no irregularities occur in the
forming of such rounded or chamfered corners. Corners of this type are
normally formed by applying a number of closely spaced parallel creases
or striations to the box blank at the corner forming zone, and
subsequently forming the blank into a box. A problem associated with
the method is that equi-angular folding along each crease line is not
assured, leading to the formation of an uneven and unattractive fold. EP-A-0 205 894 relates to a corner forming apparatus as set out in the
preamble of Claim 1. However, the disclosed device employs folding dies
and complemental punches and requires a dedicated filling device for filling
partly formed boxes with cigarettes. In a drive for economy and efficiency,
the present invention seeks to overcome disadvantages associated with these
characteristics.According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a box corner
forming apparatus as set out in Claim 1.Preferred features of this aspect of the invention are set out in Claims 2 to 7.According to a second aspect, the invention extends to a method of forming
a non-rectangular corner in a box as set out in Claim 8.According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for
forming a non-rectangular corner in a box as set out in Claim 9.Preferred features of this aspect of the invention are set out in Claim 10. Figure 1shows a side view of a corner forming
apparatus of the invention incorporated into
a drying drum for a hinge-lid pack cigarette
box;Figure 1Ashows a detailed side view of a party formed
hinge-lid pack on a slide packet transfer
mechanism just prior to insertion into the
drying drum; Figure 2shows an enlarged detail of the corner
forming apparatus of Figure 1;Figure 3 shows a cross section on the line 3-3 of 
Figure 2; Figures 4A to 4C  show schematic side views of the corner
forming apparatus illustrating various stages
in the operation thereof; andFigure 5A to 5Dshows partly schematic front views of the
corner forming apparatus illustrating various
