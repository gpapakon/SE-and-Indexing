<ABSTRACT>
The interconnections are made, in this interface box (1), by non-wire links, such as a "bus" consisting of parallel and longitudinal strips (30) or a cut-out circuit. The compartment (5) specific to the distributor accommodates a module (25) for rapid interconnection of telephone lines, as well as preferably a protection module (36) and a R-C module (35). The connection device (4) specific to the subscriber comprises, in addition to another rapid interconnection module (79), a telephone test socket (64) which is associated with electromechanical means (65,73,72,71) which electrically isolate the subscriber line from the incoming line as soon as it is desired to plug a matching telephone plug into this socket (64).

<CLAIMS>
Terminal device for telephone interconnection of at least one subscriber,
comprising:


a box (1) divided into two compartments, of which first compartment (5)
contains connectors for an Administration or private company in charge of

the telephone distribution, and of which second compartment (4) contains
connectors for the telephone line or lines of the subscriber (20, 21) which

are connected to the corresponding line or lines (14, 15) of the
Administration or private company, via this terminal interconnection device,

and
a test socket, present in the second compartment (4), designed for each line
(20, 14 ; 21, 15), and composed of a telephone female socket (64) connected

directly on the line (14, 15) of said Administration or private company and
at output of the first compartment (5) reserved therefore, the test socket

being adapted to receive a conjugate male plug which normally equips a
terminal or telephone set,
characterized in that
 it further comprises:

electrical interconnections made by non-wire connecting means such as
metal blades (29, 30) or cut-out metal circuits (97, 102);
a closing flap (65) of said test socket (64), associated with electro-mechanical
means (66, 71, 72, 73) which, when this flap (65) is opened to

disengage the test socket (64) that it covers, in order to connect the
conjugate male plug into said female socket (64), automatically leading, by

electrical switch effect (71), the electrical disconnection of the line circuits
(74, 21) placed downstream from this test socket (64), i.e. the line circuits

for the subscriber's private installation; and
at least one plug-in module (51,52, 104) which contains especially said
telephone female socket (64) as well as said closing flap (65) associated

with said electro-mechanical means (66, 73, 72, 71).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the connections, in said box (1),
of the ends of the incoming (10, 11; 12, 13) and outgoing (16, 17; 18, 19) lines

wires (14,15,20,21) are made by modules (25, 26, 78, 79) for rapid
interconnection of telephone lines with self-stripping slots and control screws.
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said modules (25, 78) being of
the type each comprising two metal contacts (28, 76) with upper and lower self-stripping

slots, these modules (25, 78) do not comprise orifices for introduction, in
a purpose of connection by the lower slot part of each of its two contacts (28, 76),

of a second pair of wires, but, on the contrary this lower slot part is plugged on the
edge of a metal blade (30, 74) which form part of said electrical interconnections

contained in said box (1).
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 said
first compartment (5) is adapted to receive, by plugging on said non-wire

connections (29, 30) auxiliary functional modules, such as for example a
protection module (36) with overvoltage arrester (34) and/or an R-C module (35).
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 it is
arranged to receive, in said second compartment (4), a plug-in module (104)

provided with a "modular-jack" socket (64) as test socket.
Device according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 it is arranged (109-112) so as to

use only one and same cut-out circuit (105) to receive the plug-in module (104).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the bottom (2) of the box (1) is
adapted to receive, as desired either one or at least two plug-in modules (113, 114)

which each comprise a half-compartment (5A) provided with the connectors
relative to an incoming line and a half-compartment (4A) provided with the

connectors relative to an outgoing line, these modules (113, 114) being adapted to
plug in said bottom of receiving box (2) which is, in the bare state, almost empty

of connectors, containing earth connections (115, 116, 117, 118, 119), these
modules (113, 114) plugging against each other to be able to recreate, in the case 

where they are all plugged in this box bottom (2), the two complete compartments
(4, 5) relative to the connection of a number of lines, which each comprise an

incoming line and an outgoing line, which is equal to the number of plugged-in
modules.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the flap (65) comprises means
(127, 128) adapted to retain it in open position even if it is provided with a biasing

device (66) into closed position, these means cooperating with a fixed member
(129) of the terminal.
Device according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 these retaining means are
formed with a semi-rigid tab (127) of the flap (65), of which the end in overhang

comprises a clipping hook (128) adapted to cooperate with a conjugate member
(129) of the terminal.
