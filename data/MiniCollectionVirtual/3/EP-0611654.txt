<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ink-jet print head which 
functions according to the drop-on-demand principle. Said 

print head operates without the ink being subjected to heat 
and is suited for high resolution. Proceeding from an 

ink-jet print head having a plurality of ink channels which 
are separated from each other by walls (8) forming integral 

units of an insulating housing (11), it is proposed that the 
surfaces of the separating walls (8), limiting the channels, 

be provided with conductive coatings (28). In order that a 
drop be ejected, the coatings (28) associated with the ink 

channel (16) concerned are pulsewise provided with charges 
of opposite polarities. Due to the electrostatic attraction 

forces of the coatings (28), the separating walls (8) 
limiting the ink channel (16) concerned move toward each 

other at least partially and cause excess pressure to be 
produced in the ink channel (16), which leads to the 

ejection of an ink drop. During printing breaks, readiness 
for use can be determined by measuring the capacity of the 

coatings (28) associated with an ink channel (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ink-jet print head having at 
least one row of adjacent ink channels each of which 
includes means which can be electrically activated 
separately and serve for ejecting ink drops from outlets 
opening associated with each of said channels in accordance 
with printing data. From DE 30 12 698, ink-jet print heads are known which 
function according to the bubble-jet principle. i.e. the 
electrically activatable element for ejecting ink drops is a 
heating element which is energized pulsewise. The ink in the 
ink channel is heated locally so that an ink vapour bubble 
develops which collapses as soon as the power supply is cut. 
This bubble causes a pressure wave in the ink channel, which 
allows an ink jet of a restricted mass to be ejected from 
the outlet opening onto the surface of a close record 
carrier. Although the bubble-jet technology has proved to be useful 
in practice, the chemistry of the ink causes a number of 
problems. On the one hand, the ink used must necessarily 
consist of a mixture of substances with evaporating 
capacities in order that the vapour bubble be produced on 
which the bubble-jet principle is based, and on the other 
hand the ink has to meet permanently all the requirements 
regarding color saturation, long-term stability, fastness 
properties, drying behaviour and resistance against wiping 
despite the fact that the ink is heated.  Usually, such ink material mainly consists of water which 
lends the ink properties which interfere with the 
requirements for resistance against wiping and fastness. In order to be able to also use inks of different 
compositions such as water-free inks, it is known for the 
walls confining each channel to be moved mechanically thus 
causing a pressure wave which leads to the ejection of an 
ink drop. EP 0 278 590 relates to an electrically pulsed 
drop depositing device whose channel partition walls are 
tongue-shaped piezo elements fixed to one side of said 
walls. When two piezo elements which limit an ink channel 
are electrically activated, their free ends shift towards 
each other in a transverse direction and thus produce in the 
ink channel concerned the pressure wave required. However, the microstructural working of piezo chrystals by 
using known operating methods is very costly and cannot be 
realized in ink-jet print heads of high resolution. Moreover, WO 91/17891 discloses an ink-jet print head of the 
bubble-jet type which consists of one integral piece made of 
a silicon block by anisotropic etching.
