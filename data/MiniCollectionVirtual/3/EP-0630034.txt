<ABSTRACT>
The circuit breaker comprises a casing (1), a base (2) provided with at least two electrical contact studs (3a), a transverse contact bridge (6) situated above the contact studs, a movable axial actuation element (16, 17, 21) interacting mechanically with the transverse contact bridge and provided with at least one roller wheel (19), a fixed electrical coil (7) for generating an electromagnetic force acting axially on the movable element towards the contact studs, a return spring (24) acting axially on the movable element, moving it away from the contact studs, a lower ramp (12a) and an upper ramp (10a) mounted fixed opposite one another and interacting with the roller wheel respectively during the first part and the last part of the phase of actuation of the contact bridge. The upper ramp (10a) defines two rest states of the roller wheel corresponding to two electrical states (ON, OFF) of the circuit breaker.

Circuit breaker comprising a casing (1), a base
(2) provided with at least two electrical contact pads

(3a), a transverse contact bridge (6) located above the
contact pads and capable of coming into contact with

the said contact pads, and means (5) for actuating the
transverse bridge which electrically makes or breaks

the connection between the contact pads, the actuating
means comprising an axially moveable actuating device

(16, 17, 21) which engages mechanically with the
transverse contact bridge and is provided with a

transverse spindle (18), a fixed electrical coil (7)
for generating an electromagnetic force which acts

axially on the moveable device in the direction of the
contact pads, a return spring (24) acting axially on

the moveable device so as to move it away from the
contact pads, a lower ramp (12a) and an upper ramp

(10a) which are mounted so as to be fixed one with
respect to the other and engaging with the transverse

spindle respectively during the first part and the last
part of the phase of actuating the contact bridge, the

upper ramp (10a) defining two rest states (P1, P5) of
the transverse spindle corresponding to two electrical

states (ON, OFF) of the circuit breaker, characterized
in that it comprises two rolling wheels (19) mounted on

the transverse spindle (18), the lower ramp (12a) and
the upper ramp (10a) each comprising guiding surfaces

(12b, 10c) which separate two consecutive angular
mechanical stops (12c, 10b) for the rolling wheel (19),

each mechanical stop of one of the ramps being axially
opposite a guiding surface of the other ramp, the

guiding surfaces (10c, 12b) and the angular stop
surfaces (10b, 12c) being distributed alternately

around the circumference.
Circuit breaker according to Claim 1, characterized
in that two rolling wheels (19) are mounted on

the ends of the transverse spindle (18) passing through
a control spindle (17) of the moveable device. 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the upper ramp (10a) and the lower ramp

(12a) are made on tubular portions of the same
diameter.
Circuit breaker according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the moveable

device comprises a moveable core (16) which slides
axially in a cylindrical passage (8a) formed in the

excitation coil (7), the electromagnetic force
generated by the coil (7) acting directly on the

moveable core (16).
Circuit breaker according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the guiding

surfaces (10c, 12b) of the upper ramp (10a) and the
lower ramp (12a) are formed by helical angular sectors

whose inclinations with respect to a transverse plane
are of opposite sign.
Circuit breaker according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the moveable

actuating device is completely enclosed in the casing
(1).
Circuit breaker according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the upper wall (1a) of the

casing (1) has a tubular opening (1b) allowing a part
(16) of the moveable actuating device to pass through

it so as to project to the outside of the casing.
Circuit breaker according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the upper wall (1a) of the

casing (1) has a tubular opening (1b) extended by a
tubular part (1c) connected to an automatic supply, the

upper end (16a) of the moveable device sliding in a
sealed manner inside the tubular opening (1b) of the

casing.
