<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a trisazo 
compound, a method for dyeing fiber material, paper or 
leather by using the trisazo compound and an ink containing 
the trisazo compound. Polyazo direct or acid dyes produced from 
benzidine or its derivatives have hitherto been used for 
dyeing fiber materials having a hydroxy or amino group. 
However, production of benzidine used as a starting material 
of these dyes is prohibited, and benzidine derivatives 
exemplified by o-tolidine and dianisidine are resistered as 
special chemical substances of which handling is restricted 
in production of these dyes, because of their toxicity. For 
such a reason, a variety of compounds have been proposed as 
non-benzidine type dyes. However, none of them has yet 
satisfied the requirements of users in the dye abilities. C.I. Direct Black 168 represented by the following 
formula is also a dye proposed as a non-benzidine type dye. 
   Ink containing the dye is mentioned in JP-A-63-105079  
 
("JP-A-" means Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication i.e. "Kokai"). However, for dyeing fiber 
materials or paper, it cannot give a deep black color image 
because of, for example, inferiority in build-up property. 
Further, it is unsatisfactory in solubility as a dye for an 
ink and it gives a recording image having insufficient 
water resistance. Particularly when used as an ink for the ink 
jet-process, it often causes clogging of the nozzle due to 
deposition of dye and gives a recording image having 
insufficient water resistance. Thus, it is unsatisfactory 
from the view point of performances in any uses. It is the object of the present invention to 
provide a compound capable of satisfying the necessary 
conditions of a dye for an ink which compound is producible 
without using benzidine nor a derivative thereof as a 
starting material. This object is achieved by the present 
invention. The present invention provides a trisazo compound 
represented by the following formula(1) in the free acid 
form: 
wherein Q¹ is a phenylene group which may be optionally 
substituted by a substituent mentioned-below; Q² is a  
 
phenyl or naphtyl group which may be optionally substituted 
by a substituent such as mentioned below; one of A and B 
is a hydroxy group and the other is an amino group; k is 1 
or 2; one of m and n is 1 and the other is 0; X and Y 
independently of one another are each -OR¹, -SR², -NR³R⁴ or 
wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ independently of one another are 
each a hydrogen atom, an alkyl, phenyl or naphthyl group 
which
