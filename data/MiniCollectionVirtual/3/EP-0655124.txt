<ABSTRACT>
Instead of the conventional coupling points, the optical fibre sensor (2) has shape memory alloy components (4) which, in one of their memorized shapes, create a stress in the optical fibre. This stress is easily located using an interferometer (3). The multiple sensor configuration is thus easily reconfigurable.

Sensor of the optical fibre type, at least part
of which acts as a sensor of a physical quantity

manifested by a stress exerted on the fibre, this
optical fibre (2) interacting with a light source (1),

an optical read device (3), and an element (4) made of
a shape-memory alloy arranged on the optical fibre,

this shape-memory element being designed and taught so
that, when it is at temperatures lying on one side of

the transition temperature of the constituent material
it exerts virtually no stress on the fibre, and when it

is at temperatures lying on the other side of the said
transition temperature it exerts on the fibre a stress

which can be measured by the said read device,
characterized in that the optical fibre is a high-birefringence

fibre, in that the sensor includes
several elements made of a shape-memory alloy which are

distributed along the optical fibre, in that the
measurement made by the optical read device is an

interferometric or polarimetric measurement and in that
the stress that these elements exert on the fibre is a

quasi-isotropic radial stress.
Sensor according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it includes several elements made of a shape-memory

alloy which are distributed along the optical
fibre and in that they all have the same transition

temperature.
Sensor according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it includes several elements made of a shape-memory

alloy which are distributed along the optical 
fibre and in that they have different transition

temperatures.
Sensor according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the read device detects

the interference-peak shift due to the length variation
of the optical fibre as a result of temperature

variations to which it is subjected and in that this
detection serves to correct the measurements of

physical quantities normally performed by the sensor.
Sensor according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that each element made of a

shape-memory alloy has the shape of a tubular helix.
Sensor according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the helix is made of a shape-memory alloy having a

composition gradient.
Sensor according to one of Claims 5 and 6,
characterized in that each element made of a shape-memory

alloy is produced from a wire having a diameter
of approximately 60 Âµm and includes approximately ten

touching turns.
Sensor according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that each element made of a shape-memory

alloy has a ring shape.
Sensor according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that each element made of a shape-memory

alloy has a tubular shape.
Sensor according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the SMA elements are

connected selectively to an electric power generator.
Sensor according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at least part of the SMA

elements (M1 to M4) is fixed to a structure, the
deformations of which are measured, and in that the

optical fibre is held taut between the elements
defining the measurement zones.
