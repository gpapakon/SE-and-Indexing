<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for applying a length of 
adhesive tape from a supply of adhesive tape along 

the length of a leading edge of a roll of web 
material includes a cutting mechanism for cutting the 

length of web material to form a length of leading 
edge on the roll of web material. An application 

mechanism of the apparatus is configured to remove 
adhesive tape from the supply of adhesive tape and 

apply adhesive tape along a length of the leading 
edge of the web material. A take-up mechanism 

removes a liner from the adhesive tape during the 
application of the adhesive tape to the leading edge. 

A buffing mechanism contacts the adhesive tape 
applied along the length of the leading edge to 

insure contact between the adhesive tape and an outer 
layer portion of the roll of web material that is 

directly adjacent the leading edge. A cutoff 
mechanism cuts the adhesive tape to form the length 

of adhesive tape along the leading edge of the web 
material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
an apparatus and method for applying a strip of 
material to an elongate member. In particular, the 
present invention is an apparatus and method for 
applying flying splice, pressure sensitive, adhesive 
tape to a leading edge of a roll of web material. In the newspaper and magazine publishing 
industry, the lengths of web material (i.e., paper), 
from which individual newspapers or magazines are 
printed, are contained on rolls (i.e., elongate 
members). Typically, the length of web material of 
a roll is fixed, and the web material is continuous 
from its trailing edge at the core of the roll to its 
leading edge at the periphery of the roll. The 
length of web material from an individual roll is fed 
into a printing apparatus where print and/or pictures 
are applied to the web material in a continuous, 
automated process. Next, the length of web material 
is cut into sheets of desired size and then these 
sheets are assembled into individual newspapers or 
magazines. The cutting of the sheets and the 
assembling of the sheets into their final print 
medium format is once again, a continuous, automated 
process. Typically, during the continuous process of 
printing, cutting and assembling of the print medium, 
the length of web material travels at speeds of 
between 2000 and 3000 feet per minute. Hence, large 
numbers of individual newspapers or magazines can be 
produced in a relatively short period of time. A disadvantage in the use of the rolls of 
web material occurs when splicing a leading edge of 
a "new" roll of web material to the trailing edge of 
an "old" roll of web material currently traveling  
 
through the continuous printing, cutting and 
assembling process. This type of new-to-old roll 
connection is referred to as a "flying splice", and 
is a splice made between an expiring or leading roll 
of web material and a new or following roll of web 
material in a continuous manner without reducing 
either the equipment speed or the speed of the web. 
Typically, to splice the leading edge of the new roll 
to the trailing edge of the old roll, one or more 
pieces of adhesive tape are manually applied to the 
leading edge of the new roll of web material. 
Adhesive, such as pressure sensitive adhesive, on a 
bottom surface of the tape secures the tape to the 
leading edge. With the tape secured to the leading 
edge of the new roll, the leading edge of the new 
roll is brought into contact with the old roll, where 
adhesive, such as pressure sensitive
