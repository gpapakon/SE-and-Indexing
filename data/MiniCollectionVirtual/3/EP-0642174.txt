<ABSTRACT>
A field effect transistor of the present invention 
includes a semiconductor substrate (1), an active layer (2) 

formed by doping an impurity in a surface region of the 
semiconductor substrate, two heavily doped layers (3,4) formed 

respectively by doping the impurity at the two end 
portions of the active layer, a gate electrode (5) formed on 

the active layer to be in Schottky contact with the active 
layer, and source and drain electrodes (6,7) formed 

respectively on the two heavily doped layers to be in 
ohmic contact with the two heavily doped layers. The 

length W

 of a portion where a gate-electrode-side portion 
of at least one of said source and drain electrodes and 

said heavily doped layer overlap each other is set with 
respect to a length W

source- and drain-electrode-side edge portions of said

. For this reason, a drain 

current flowing in the gate-electrode-side edge portion 
of the source or drain electrode is distributed as 

compared to the prior art, thereby reducing the contact 
resistance of the source or drain electrode. Therefore, 

since the drain-source resistance in an ON state is 

reduced, the field effect transistor can be applied to a 
circuit which requires a high breakdown voltage as 

needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a field effect 
transistor (FET) manufactured using a semiconductor 
substrate consisting of GaAs, InP, or the like and, more 
particularly, to a field effect transistor effectively 
applied to a high output amplifier or switching circuit 
which operates at a microwave frequency band. With the recent advance of a mobile communication 
system, a demand for compact and high-performance 
components which operate at a high frequency has 
increased. In correspondence with this tendency, FETs, 
and particularly MESFETs manufactured using a compound 
semiconductor such as GaAs, or HEMTs are put to practical 
use as transistors usable beyond the characteristic limit 
of an Si bipolar transistor conventionally used in a high 
frequency band. As a conventional FET, a GaAs Schottky gate field 
effect transistor (GaAs-MESFET) generally has a structure 
in which an n-type active layer is formed in a 
semiconductor substrate, and n⁺-type heavily doped layers 
are formed at the two end portions of the active layer. 
In addition, a gate electrode is formed on the active  
 
layer to be in Schottky contact with the active layer. A 
source electrode and a drain electrode are formed on the 
two heavily doped layers to be in ohmic contact with the 
heavily doped layers, respectively. In the manufacturing process of such an FET, when a 
pattern is to be formed on the semiconductor substrate 
by, e.g., an optical exposure technique, in order to 
ensure an alignment margin with respect to a pattern 
formed in advance, a next pattern is sometimes formed 
only slightly larger with a small margin in 
correspondence with the maximum misalignment of the 
exposure apparatus. For this reason, in consideration of 
the necessary minimum size of the alignment margin for 
pattern formation, each of the two heavily doped layers 
is formed partially larger than the active layer. 
Similarly, the gate electrode is formed partially larger 
than the active layer. The source and drain electrodes 
are formed partially larger than the heavily doped 
layers, respectively. However, the difference is as 
large as about 0.1 to 1 µm. Such a small size can be 
ignored as compared to a normal gate width. An ohmic electrode refers to a source or drain 
electrode formed to be in ohmic contact with a heavily 
doped layer. A gate width WG refers to the length of a 
portion where the source- or drain-electrode-side edge 
portion of the gate electrode and the active layer  
 
overlap each other. A contact width WC refers to
