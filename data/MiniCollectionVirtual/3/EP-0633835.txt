<ABSTRACT>
A method of making an elongate plastic member assembly (76, 80, 84, 88) includes providing at least an elongate plastic member (62) having a plastic wall (66). One portion of an elongate plastic member (62) is aligned adjacent to another portion of an elongate plastic member (62) and the walls (66) of the adjacent elongate plastic members are plasticized. The plasticized portions of the walls are flowed into a mold (32) between adjacent elongate portions to fuse the adjacent portions together. A peelable elongate plastic member (76, 80, 84, 88) is made in accordance with the process described above. The elongate plastic member assembly may be made of a single elongate plastic member (62) in a coiled configuration or a plurality of elongate plastic members joined in parallel at selected points along their length. Another aspect of the present invention is an apparatus (10) for making an elongate plastic member assembly. The apparatus (10) includes complementary upper (14) and lower (16) radio frequency dies, each die having a leading surface (20', 20) with a plurality of parallel grooves (22', 22) therein including a first and a last parallel groove. Adjacent parallel grooves of both dies are separated by a land strip (28', 28) of the leading surface. An outermost edge of the first and last parallel grooves of at least one of the upper and lower dies is beveled (34, 36, 38, 40). Parallel grooves of the upper and lower dies, with the leading surfaces in an operative position, define a plurality of receiving channels (30) and the land strips define a plurality of flow chambers (32). A press (60) is provided for bringing leading surfaces of the upper and lower dies into an operative position in close proximity to one another. A radio frequency generator (18) selectively applies an energy potential between the upper and lower dies to plasticize the elongate plastic members, whereby plastic flows into the flow chambers (32) to fuse adjacent elongate plastic members together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward elongate 
plastic member assemblies and, more particularly, toward a 
peelable assembly of a plurality of intravascular tubes or 
plastic coated wires, a method of making the assemblies and 
an apparatus for making the assemblies. A variety of intravascular tube assemblies are 
known in the art. One such assembly consists of a number 
of elongate plastic tubes arranged in parallel, the tubes 
being joined to adjacent tubes along their entire length by 
an integral web of the plastic tube material. One such 
structure is disclosed in Hilderbrandt, U.S. Patent No. 
3,836,415. Prior art tube assemblies are typically formed 
through integral extrusion. Integral extrusion, however, 
has several limitations. Most significantly, integral 
extrusion has proven to be a relatively expensive procedure. 
In addition, integral extrusion limits the shapes 
the tube assembly can take. For example, it is not possible 
to integrally extrude a coil tube assembly with individual 
coils of the assembly joined to adjacent coils. In 
addition, it is very difficult, if not commercially impractical, 
to join adjacent tubes at intervals along their 
length by conventional integral extrusion techniques. One alternative method to integral extrusion for 
joining adjacent tubes in a tube assembly known in the 
prior art is the use of a plastic solvent which softens and 
melts an exterior peripheral surface of adjacent tubes. 
After application of the solvent, the tubes are placed in 
their desired adjacent positions, and upon evaporation of 
the solvent, a fluid resistant bond is formed between  
 
adjacent tubes. This process has two advantages over 
extrusion. First, it provides a method for joining tubes 
into an assembly at intervals along their lengths, as 
opposed to continuously. Second, the solvent process 
permits formation of tube assemblies such as coils. The 
use of solvents, however, is not without serious disadvantages. 
The solvents tend to emit noxious fumes which are 
dangerous to assembly workers. Also, the use of solvents 
creates hazardous waste disposal problems. The application 
of the solvents must be closely controlled so as to prevent 
application of too little or too much solvent, resulting in 
improper bonding of the tubes into an assembly or erosion 
of the tubes comprising the assembly. Finally, the use of 
solvents is undesirable because residual solvents can be 
harmful to users of the assembly -- particularly where the 
assemblies are used in the medical field
