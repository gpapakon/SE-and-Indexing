<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an implantable drainage device for the treatment of hydrocephalus. For this purpose, it comprises a first pressure regulation valve (1; 40, 42; 52, 57) in series with a flow-rate regulation valve (2; 41, 44; 53, 57), and a second pressure regulation valve (3; 46) in parallel with the said flow-rate regulation valve, the second pressure regulation valve having an opening differential pressure which is greater than that of the first.
