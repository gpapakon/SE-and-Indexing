<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention is that of public works. One of the main applications of the invention is in marine and fluvial structures such as dikes which are exposed to waves and currents and are disposed on unstable ground such as sand. The device for stabilizing the shielding element (14) of the body (15) of a structure (1) with a sloping part comprises a grid (4) for holding the elements secured to the shielding surface (14) by means (5) anchored through the structure (1). Also provided on the ground (12) is a base shoe (2) that accommodates the structure (1) and means for anchoring (7) the shoe (2) in relation to the ground (12), the grid (4) being mounted on the shoe (2). The shoe anchoring means (5) consist of crossties lying across the shield (14) of the structure (1) and are secured opposite the body of said structure (1).
