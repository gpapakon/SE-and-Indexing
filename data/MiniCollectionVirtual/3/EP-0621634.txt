<ABSTRACT>
In integrated semiconductor arrangements which have a region (6, 7) with circuit elements and a region (8) for the wiring of the circuit elements, for example standard cells or gate arrays with wiring channels, one output (20, 21) of a switching stage is loaded by the capacitance between the signal connecting lead (20, ..., 25) and the semiconductor material of the wiring region (8) located thereunder. The wiring region (8) has, alternatingly, preferably equally large, p- and n-doped regions (26, ..., 30) which make contact respectively with the negative and positive supply potential (VSS, VDD). Consequently, the capacitance effective at the output is divided approximately symmetrically between the two supply potentials (VDD, VSS). In consequence, the part of the discharge current fed via the voltage supply and disturbing influences induced by this on the supply voltage are reduced.
