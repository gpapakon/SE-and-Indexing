<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber
transmission line comprising a structure for making it

possible to maintain a desirable mean transmission
characteristic as a whole regardless of the fluctuation in

total length caused upon cutting end portions; and an optical
cable including the same. The optical fiber transmission

line according to the present invention comprises a main
transmission line and first and second end sections connected,

respectively, to both ends of the main transmission line.
As a typical configuration, the main transmission line is

constituted by a single-mode optical fiber and a
dispersion-compensating optical fiber. At a wavelength of

1.55 µm, the single-mode optical fiber has a positive
chromatic dispersion, and the dispersion-compensating

optical fiber has a negative chromatic dispersion. The
respective chromatic dispersions and lengths of the

single-mode optical fiber and dispersion-compensating
optical fiber are set so as to lower the absolute value of

mean chromatic dispersion of the main transmission line as
a whole, whereas each of the first and second end sections

has a chromatic dispersion substantially equal to the mean
chromatic dispersion in order to suppress the influence upon

the mean of the optical fiber transmission line as a whole
caused by the fluctuation in length due to the cutting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber transmission line employable as an optical transmission line in a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmission system, and an optical cable including the same.A WDM transmission system enables high-speed, large-capacity optical communications by utilizing a plurality of signal channels. The optical transmission line laid in each repeating section of the WDM transmission system is desired to have an excellent transmission characteristic in a signal wavelength region (e.g., 1.55-µm wavelengthband). Therefore, as an optical transmission line having an excellent signal transmission characteristic, optical fibers whose transmission characteristic changes along the longitudinal direction thereof have been proposed.For example, a conventional optical fiber transmission line described in T. Naito, et al., "1 Terabit/s WDM Transmission over 10,000 km," ECOC'99, PD2-1 (1999) (first literature) is constituted by a single-mode optical fiber (an optical fiber having a positive chromatic dispersion) positioned on the upstream side in the signal-advancing direction and a dispersion-compensating optical fiber (an optical fiber having a negative chromatic dispersion) positioned on the downstream side. In the 1.55-µm wavelength band, the single-mode optical fiber has a positive chromatic dispersion and a relatively large mode field diameter. On the other hand, the dispersion-compensating optical fiber has a negative chromatic dispersion and a relatively small mode field diameter in the 1.55-µm wavelength band, and is likely to generate nonlinear optical phenomena in general.In the conventional optical fiber transmission line described in the above-mentioned first literature, signals successively propagate through the single-mode optical fiber and dispersion-compensating optical fiber. Though the signals propagating through the single-mode optical fiber have a high power, nonlinear optical phenomena are restrained from occurring since the single-mode optical fiber has a relatively large mode field diameter. The signals lower their power while propagating through the single-mode optical fiber, and the signals having lowered their power reaches the dispersion-compensating optical fiber. As a consequence, the occurrence of nonlinear optical phenomena is sufficiently suppressed even when the signals propagate through the dispersion-compensating optical fiber having a relatively small mode field diameter. Further, since the single-mode optical fiber and
