<ABSTRACT>
A sealing plug for sealing a container containing a 
flowable product such as adhesive in a syringe comprises a 

front plug member (10) and a rear plug member (12). The front 
plug member (10) has an external periphery (14) for sealingly 

engaging the internal periphery of the aperture and has a 
front face (20) for introduction into the aperture which 

contains a bleed passage (24) extending from said front face 
to connect with a cavity (22) open to the rear of the front 

plug member. The rear plug member (12) is sealingly and 
resiliently received in the cavity (22) to close the same but 

is displaceable by gas pressure applied via said bleed passage 
(24). Longitudinally running angularly offset grooves (36) 

and (38) in the rear plug member (12) then break the seal 
between the cavity and the rear plug member and allow the 

venting of said gas pressure past said rear plug member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sealing plugs which may
be used for closing apertures. The invention has particular
but not exclusive relevance to sealing plugs for use in
closing apertures in containers containing flowable products,
e.g. adhesive dispensers.Various products including adhesives are supplied in
syringe-type dispensers having a barrel with an open charging
end through which the product is introduced into the dispenser
and having at the opposite end a nozzle through which the
product is to be dispensed. After the flowable product has
been introduced into the barrel, it is necessary to seal the
charging end with a suitable plug. In use, the nozzle end is
opened and a suitable gun is used to force the sealing plug
down the barrel as a syringe plunger to expel the contents.In the insertion of the sealing plug it is desirable to
make provision for the expulsion of air which would otherwise
be trapped between the sealing plug and the flowable contents.
If this is not done, such trapped air may be compressed and
may tend to force the sealing plug back out of the charging
end of the container. Also, air trapped in the syringe body
will be compressed when the syringe is used and pressure is
applied to the syringe plunger to express the contents through
the nozzle. The presence of compressed air at that stage will
mean that the contents will continue to ooze out after plunger
movement stops. Where the flowable contents are sensitive to
air, the air must be expelled during the sealing operation to
avoid deterioration of the flowable product. Various methods
for achieving this have been proposed.These include sealing the periphery of the sealing plug
with an O-ring and using inserted fingers or fixed lugs
momentarily to break the seal between the O-ring and the
interior wall of the aperture into which the sealing plug is
forced. Systems which employ O-rings are however
disadvantageous in that the O-ring may become displaced from 
its proper position and allow leakage or may be damaged by the
venting operation, once again resulting in leakage.
Furthermore, O-rings are attacked by some products which need
to be packaged in such systems.WO90/05096 discloses a sealing arrangement for an
adhesive dispenser intended to tackle this problem by enabling
one to avoid the use of O-rings. This provides a sealing plug
having a front face including a bleed passage extending to the
rear of the sealing plug where there is formed a cavity. A
stopper is provided for sealing the cavity which includes a
projecting pin

A sealing plug for closing an aperture comprising a front
plug member (10) and rear plug member (12), the front plug

member (10) having an external periphery (14) for sealingly
engaging the internal periphery of a said aperture and having

a front face (20) for introduction into the aperture which
front face (20) contains a bleed passage (24) extending from

said front face to connect with a cavity (22) open to the rear
of said front plug member, the rear plug member (12) being

sealingly and resiliently received in said cavity (22) to
close the same, characterised in that said rear plug member

(12) is displaceable by gas pressure applied via said bleed
passage (24) so as momentarily to break the seal between the

cavity and rear plug member and allow the venting of said gas
pressure past said rear plug member.
A sealing plug for sealing a container containing a
flowable product, which sealing plug comprises a bleed
 passage
extending from a front part (20) thereof for introduction into

said container to an interior portion (22) of said sealing
plug, characterised in that said sealing plug further includes

means actuatable by pressure of gas trapped between said
sealing plug and said product for venting said interior

portion of said sealing plug so as to release said trapped gas
without permitting said product to pass said sealing plug.
A sealing plug as claimed in Claim 2, comprising a front
plug member (10) and a rear plug member (12), the front plug

member (10) having an external periphery (14) for sealingly
the engaging the internal periphery of an aperture in a said

container and having a front face (20) for introduction into
the aperture which front face contains said bleed passage (24)

extending from said front face to connect with a cavity (22)
open to the rear of said front plug member, said rear plug

member (12) being sealingly and resiliently received in said 
cavity to close the same, wherein said rear plug member is

displaceable by said gas pressure applied via said bleed
passage so as momentarily to break the seal between the cavity

and the rear plug member and allow venting of said gas
pressure past said rear plug member.
A sealing plug as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 3, wherein
the cavity (20) and the rear plug member (12) are circular in

cross-section and the resilient sealing connection
therebetween is by virtue of an annular rib (28) and an

annular groove (32) provided each on a respective one of said
cavity interior and said rear plug member.
A sealing plug as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the annular
groove (34) is on the rear plug member (12) and the annular

rib (28) is on the wall of the cavity (22).
A sealing plug as claimed in Claim 5, wherein there is
a gas bleed passage (36) extending from said annular groove

out of said sealing plug and a gas bleed passage (38) leading
to said annular groove from said cavity in the front plug

member.
A sealing plug as claimed in Claim 6, wherein each said
gas bleed passage leading to or from said annular groove (34)

is formed by a groove in the periphery of the rear plug
member.
A sealing plug as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7, wherein
the gas bleed passages (36, 38) leading to and from said

annular groove are off-set angularly from one another.
A sealing plug as claimed in any one of Claims 3 to 8,
wherein the front face of the rear plug member and the base

of the cavity in the front plug member are so shaped that when
the rear plug member is fully home in the cavity, a portion 

of the volume of the cavity remains unfilled by the rear plug
member to accommodate flowable product and any residual

trapped gas.
