<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical fiber,
specifically to an
optical fiber doped with a rare earth element for use in an
optical fiber-type light amplifier (optical fiber
amplifier).The light amplifier using an optical fiber doped
with a rare earth element, e.g., erbium (Er) is
characterized by little noise, and data transfer at high
bit rates. Countries all over the world are studying
and developing the optical fiber amplifier. Many
results of these studies were presented in 1989 Optical
Fiber conference held in Houston, U.S.A. in February,
1989. For example, Y. Kimura et al. presented
"Efficient Er+3-doped optical fiber amplifier pumped by
a 1.48-Âµm high-power laser diode" which proved that a
laser diode is used as a beam source for exciting
(pumping) the Er doped in a quartz fiber, whereby the
optical fiber amplifier can be miniaturized.It is necessary that the optical fiber amplifier
comprises in a package a pumping beam source, an Er-doped
optical fiber, and an optical coupler for 
combining a signal beam and a pumping beam. The optical
coupler is generally small-sized, and the pumping beam
source can be miniaturized by using a laser diode. But
the Er-doped optical fiber has to be, at the present, as
long as 50 - 200 m, and it is difficult to house this
optical fiber in a small package. This is because when
the optical fiber is wound in loops to be compact, the
optical fiber more tends to break off as the radius of
curvature becomes smaller. When the optical fiber is
wound in a number of loops, the loops of the Er-doped
optical fiber are adjacent to one another, with the
result that the optical fiber becomes unsuitable for
high bit-rate transmission. The stimulated emission
light of the Er ions excited in the optical fiber is
given forth not only in the axial direction of the
optical fiber but also in all directions and intrudes
into the adjacent loops of the optical fibers as leakage
radiation. Resultantly the leakage radiation as well is
amplified unsuitably for high bit-rate signal transfer.This problem occurs not only with the optical fiber
amplifier but also with the optical fiber laser
oscillator. That is, to miniaturize the laser
oscillator, needless to say it is necessary to wind the
Er-doped optical fiber into small loops. In other
words, to miniaturize the optical fiber-type optically
active device, such as a light amplifier, a laser
oscillator or others, it is necessary to prevent 
breakage of loops of the optical fiber and shut off
leakage light.A first object of this invention is to
