<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is achievement of improved 
palatability of compositions containing high-viscosity 
cellulose ethers of a specific particle-size distribution 
and the use of such compositions for reducing the serum 
cholesterol level of an animal. The use of cellulose ethers in edible compositions 
and, in particular, pharmaceutical products, is well known. 
A common function of the cellulose ether in such uses is to 
serve as a controlled release agent. Typically, only 
minimal quantities, representing only a small percentage of 
a total formulation, of the cellulose ether are required in 
such uses. A variety of compounds are currently known to be 
useful in reducing serum cholesterol levels in humans. 
However, many of these compounds, including both systemic 
and non-systemic compounds, have undesirable side effects 
or have certain characteristics that lead to difficulties 
in patients complying with their use. For example, 
characteristics such as the sandiness, grittiness, throat 
irritation, dispersion difficulties and phase separation of 
known compounds leads to very poor patient compliance. 
Accordingly, the search for new non-systemic compounds 
useful in reducing serum cholesterol levels in humans 
continues to be an important field of research. Cholestyramine is an important, non-systemic compound 
known to be effective in treating high blood cholesterol 
levels, also known as hypercholesterolemia, which are 
believed to be responsible in many cases for 
arteriosclerosis in humans. Cholestyramine, which is 
typically orally consumed in order to effect its  
 
cholesterol lowering or controlling properties, is 
astringent and unpleasant to swallow. The cholestyramine 
also has the side effect of inducing constipation. 
Processes and compositions including cholestyramine are 
known, such as those described in US-A-3308020; US-A-3383281; 
US-A-3499960; and US-A-3947272. It is known that soluble vegetable fibers such as 
psyllium, guar, and β-glucans may exert cholesterol 
lowering effects, but these soluble fibers are not very 
efficacious on a per gram basis. Also, because soluble 
vegetable fibers are easily metabolized by colonic bacteria 
(causing extensive anaerobic production of methane, carbon 
dioxide, and hydrogen), these vegetable fibers are known to 
cause gross flatulence, bloating and grave abdominal 
discomfort when administered in therapeutically effective 
doses. Furthermore, psyllium seed husk is typically 
contaminated with proteinaceous hull which carries the
