<ABSTRACT>
A joining element for detachably joining a tool to a handle has a part (2) that may be secured to the handle and another part (1) that may be secured to the tool. Both parts (1, 2) may be interconnected and nested into each other. One part (2) has a pawl (6) which can snap into a notch (5) of the other part (1). Both parts (1, 2) are secured against rotation relative to each other by appropriate means.

<CLAIMS>
A connection element for releasably connecting a work appliance
to a handle, having a part (2) which can be secured

on the handle and a part (1) which can be secured on the
work appliance, the one part (1) at least partially having

a hollow cross section, the internal diameter of which is
greater than the external diameter of at least a section of

the other part (2), wherein the parts (1, 2) can be pushed
one into the other and can be rotationally latched to each

other, the one part (2) providing a latch (6) which can be
locked into a latch seat (5) of the other part (1) and the

other part (1) having a projection (12) running in axial
direction engaging into an oblong groove (9) and the latch

(6) as well as the latch seat (5) being arranged diametrically
opposed to each other characterised in that the projection

(12) at the other part (1) is fixedly arranged in
order to bring about an anti-twist arrangement and the

latch (6) in the latched condition being resiliently tensioned.
Connection element as in claim 1 characterised in that the
latch (6) provides a resilient ridge portion (6a) as well

as a head portion (6b).
Connection element as in claims 1 or 2 characterised in
that the latch seat (5) consists of an opening in part (1)

which towards the interior broadens for simplification of
latching of the latch (6) penetrating into the latch seat

(5). 
Connection element as in claim 3 characterised in that the
part (1) providing the latch seat (5) comprises a guide for

the latch (6).
Connection element according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised
in that the breadth of the projection (12) in

axial direction is reduced towards the introduction opening.
Connection element as in claims 1 to 5 characterised in
that 
the recess (9) provides a bigger surface than an opening
(7) in part surrounding the latch (6).
Connection element according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised
in that the parts (1, 2) provide a stop (3)

limiting movement when pushing the parts (1, 2) into each
other.
Connection element as in claim 7 characterised in that the
part (2) providing the latch (6) has an oblong section (2b)

which continues to the stop (3) and provides an end surface
pointing towards the other part, starting from which the

latch (6) at the circumference of the section (2b) in longitudinal
direction will extend standing free towards the

stop (3).
Connection element according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised
in that at least one of parts (1, 2) for securing

to the handle, respectively the work appliance, has a
double-anchor cross section and a snap-in element which is

a body substantially of ball form which can be snapped into
a ball socket on the handle or the work appliance.
Connection element as in one of claims 1 to 9 characterised
in that at least one of the parts (1, 2) consists of a

thermoplastic material.
