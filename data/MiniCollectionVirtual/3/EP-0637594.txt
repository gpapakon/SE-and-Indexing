<ABSTRACT>
Water-absorbent resins which are prepared by mixing 
polysaccharides with amino acids (amino acids and/or 

polymers of amino acids) and heating the mixture so as to 
cause a crosslinking reaction therein. Each of the water-absorbent 

resins has a water-absorbing ratio of not less 
than 10 g/g with respect to physiologic saline as well as 

having a rate of biodegradability of not less than 10 %. 
Moreover, its water-absorbing ratio under pressure is not 

less than 10 ml/g with respect to physiologic saline. The 
water-absorbing ratio under pressure is measured by using 

a measuring device that is constituted of a weighing 
machine, a container, an air-intake pipe, a conduit, a 

glass filter, and a measuring section. The 
water-absorbent resins are superior in both 

water-absorbing capacity and biodegradability, and are 
capable of maintain their water-absorbing capacity even 

under pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water-absorbent
resins which have a superior water-absorbing capacity for
aqueous fluids as well as having excellent
biodegradability, and also concerns manufacturing methods
thereof.Recently, water-absorbent resins have been used not
only for paper diapers and sanitary napkins, but also for
a wide variety of products in various fields, such as
absorbent materials for body fluids in the medical field;
sealing materials (water-sealing materials) and
anti-dewing materials in the engineering and building 
fields; freshness-retaining materials in the food field;
dehydrating agents for removing water from solvents in the
industrial field; and materials related to tree-planting
in the gardening and agricultural fields. Thus, various
water-absorbent resins have been proposed in order to meet
each of these demands.Among these water-absorbent resins that have been
proposed, chemical compounds of polyacrylic acids (salts)
are generally used extensively, since they are inexpensive
and have a superior water-absorbing capacity. However,
the water-absorbent resins of polyacrylic acids (salts)
have hardly any biodegradability although they do have
slight photo-degradability in the water-absorbed state.
Therefore, upon being disposed as wastes, even if those
water-absorbent resins are buried in the ground, they are
not decomposed by bacteria and microbes in the ground;
this results in environment hygiene problems such as
environmental pollution. In other words, the disadvantage
of the water-absorbent resins of polyacrylic acids (salts)
is that they are difficult materials to dispose.In general, pulp, paper and other materials made of
starch, carboxymethylcellulose salts, or cellulose have
been known as water-absorbent products that are
biodegradable. However, these water-absorbent products
depend on a capillary action or a thickening property in 
absorbing water. Consequently, the water- absorbent
products are inferior in their gel strength under
pressure; thus, upon receipt of an external pressure,
their water-absorbing capacity is lowered, thereby causing
the water that has been once absorbed to be released.In order to solve these problems, conventionally,
various water-absorbent resins, which are prepared by
graft-polymerizing or cross linking polysaccharides, have
been used as water-absorbent resins which have a superior
water-absorbing capacity as well as having excellent
biodegradability. The manufacturing methods for the
above-mentioned water-absorbent resins include, for
example,
