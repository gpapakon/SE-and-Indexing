<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an elastomeric seal, more 
particularly to an elastomeric seal having an asymmetrical cross-section, 
and its use at a temperature near or below its glass 
transition point to form a seal, particularly, to seal an annular space. Elastomeric seals, particularly those suitable for sealing annular 
spaces, typically have axial symmetry, such as, e.g. an "O"-ring. 
These seals are useful for various end uses, including in fuel injector 
applications for automobiles, mechanical seals and in virtually all 
instances where faces or shafts and housing need to be sealed. Certain elastomeric seals having asymmetrical cross-sections are also 
known (cf. DDR Patent 253 283 B1). Such seals are adapted for 
special applications, such as for sealing axially displaceable opposing 
components. The seals known heretofore are not suitable for functioning at 
temperatures near or below the glass transition point (Tg) of the 
elastomer. At such temperatures, various physical properties of the 
elastomeric material change, which lead to failure of the seal at such 
temperatures. The successful sealing of fluids at low temperatures is an important 
criterion in determining whether or not a mechanical system is 
operational. The use of elastomers for this function is widespread for 
many reasons. One such reason is an elastomer's ability to be 
deformed to relatively high strains and then recover almost 
completely when the deforming force is removed. This feature of  
 
elastomer is utilized in the concept of "V" seals and "lip" seals, which 
are often used in dynamic applications, or where the dimensions of 
the surfaces to be sealed have a wide tolerance range. Elastomers are also virtually incompressible and respond like highly 
viscous incompressible fluids when deformed. This trait of 
incompressibility makes solid elastomeric seals self-energizing, a 
feature that is utilized in "O"-rings and other torroidal seals against 
leakage at elevated pressures. The hydrostatic fluid pressure is 
transmitted through the seal in such a way that increasing the 
pressure of the fluid being sealed will also increase the sealing force 
applied by the seal on the sealing surfaces. The ability of elastomers to act as highly viscous fluids, however, is 
only present when the seal is functioning in an application in which 
the temperature is above its Tg. When a seal undergoes a large decrease in temperature, such that 
the temperature approaches the Tg of the elastomer, it will not 
respond in the

A elastomeric seal characterised in that it adapted for use in a 
static application at a temperature near or below its glass 

transition point and has a cross section forming a surface having 
at least three sides, two of which are concave and one of which is 

convex. 
A seal according to claim 1 having axial symmetry. 
A seal according to claims 1 or 2 wherein the cross section forms 
a surface comprising at least five sides. 
A seal according to claim 3 having a cross section comprising a 
first concave side (1.1), a convex side (1.3) adjacent thereto, a 

third side (1.2) adjacent to the convex side (1.3), a second 
concave side (1.4) adjacent to the third side (1.2) and a fifth side 

(1.5) joining the first and second concave sides (1.1, 1.4). 
A seal according to claim 4 wherein the length ratio of the first 
concave side (1.1) to the third side (1.2) is from 5 to 9 and the 

length ratio of the convex side (1.3) to the fifth side (1.5) is from 
6 to 8 and the angle (α ) formed between the tangent to the third 

side (1.2) and the tangent to the second concave side (1.4) at the 
point of intersection of the third side and second concave side is 

from 45° to 90°.

elastomer contains two or more repeating units selected from the 

group consisting of vinylidene fluoride, propylene hexafluoride, 
ethylene tetrafluoride, perfluorinated alkyl vinyl ethers and 

polyolefins. 
Use of a seal according to any one of claims 1 to 6 in a static 
application at a temperature near or below its glass transition 

point to form a seal in an annular space. 
Use of a seal according to any one of claims 4 to 6 at a 
temperature near or below its glass transition point to form a 

seal in an annular space, wherein the first concave side (1.1) 
abuts the one surface defining the annular space and the third 

side (1.2) abuts the other surface defining the annular space.
