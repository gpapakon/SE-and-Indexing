<ABSTRACT>
A processor for processing photosensitive 
material is described in which a first processing tank 

(22) containing a first processing fluid containing at 
least one component of a first concentration and a 

second processing tank (24) containing processing 
fluid having the same component to that of the first 

processing fluid are connected together by means of a 
weir (40, 43, 44, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55), the 

concentration of the component in the second 
processing fluid being different to that of the first 

concentration. The weir (40, 43, 44, 47, 49, 51, 53, 
55) causes fluid to flow from the first tank (22) to 

the second tank (24) due to hydrostatic pressure (HD1) 
of the first fluid in the first tank, and has a 

configuration such that concentration differences 
between processing fluid in the tanks does not change 

significantly over a predetermined period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for 
processing of photosensitive material. Prior art processors, in particular those 
directed for use in developing medical X-ray film, 
typically include developer, fix and wash solutions 
which are applied to exposed film. The photosensitive 
material to be developed first passes through a first 
tank containing a developer, then a second tank 
containing the fixer solution and finally through a 
third tank containing the wash solution. These tanks 
are substantially fluidly isolated from each other. 
Overflow replenishment is typically provided to each 
tank so as to replace the chemicals consumed by the 
film processing. This replenishment process dispenses 
a small volume of fresh processing solution into the 
appropriate processing tank, enabling an equal volume 
of "used" solution to overflow through a weir located 
typically in an opposite position within the same 
tank. It is also known in the prior art to provide 
a plurality of tanks for each of the development, fix 
and wash solutions. This type of processor is 
typically referred to as a multistage processor. In 
such processors the processing solution flows from one 
tank into the adjacent tank and so forth. For 
example, there may be provided three fluid processing 
tanks for holding the developing solution. The film 
is passed successively through the tanks and the 
development solution overflows from the first tank to 
the second tank and from the second tank to the third 
tank, and finally to drain. Likewise, a plurality of 
tanks containing the fix and wash solutions may also 
be provided. The processor may be operated such that 
the processing fluid flows concurrently, or counter-current 
with respect to the path of the travel of the  
 
film through the processor. Multi-stage concurrent 
and counter-current processors have been found to be 
more effective for developing, fixing and washing 
medical X-ray films. These multi-stage developing 
processors require very small amounts of fluid, 
typically 5 to 10ml per sheet of film, to be 
transferred between adjacent processing tanks at 
regular intervals. Failure to do so would result in 
improper chemical concentration distributions within 
the processing tank, and improper processing of the 
film. Typical means for transferring the solution 
from one tank to the next tank is accomplished by 
allowing the fluid simply to pass over a weir from one 
tank to the adjacent tank. However, several problems 
occur with such a process. Because of the very
