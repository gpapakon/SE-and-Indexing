<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a one coat system. The system, among other benefits, encapsulates lead paint, encapsulates and covers existing graffiti, prevents the leaching out of the harmful lead paint salts and graffiti from the encapsulated areas, and prevents the penetration into a substrate of future graffiti. The system includes a film forming mixture and a curing and activator mixture. The film forming mixture has a water based epoxy group of components, a water based polyurethane solution, a solvent based polyurethane group of components, and an oil based additive. The curing mixture has a water based epoxy group of components and oil ester based, iso-cyanate free, catalyst-curing agents. The film forming mixture is between about 93 and about 105 parts by volume of the system. The curing and activator mixture is between about 76 and about 83 parts of the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE: ONE COAT PROTECTIVE SYSTEM FOR A SURFACEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a one coat protective system to be applied to a surface. More particularly, it relates to a multiple component, two part mixture that forms a system that provides a one coat, protective film coat on a surface. The system's film coat treats, protects and encapsulates substantive substrates or surfaces that include, for example, masonary, such as cement, cement blocks, concrete, aggregates, brick, mortar and the like, plaster, plaster board and other wall covering compositions, wood, metal and aluminum. These surfaces can be either painted or unpainted.This present invention possesses certain properties not generally available in water based coatings, and a variety of environmental properties not possible with solvent based coatings. These properties are due to the combination in the present system of, heretofore uncombinable, water based 
epoxy, water based polyurethane, solvent based polyurethane and oil based additives.The properties of the film coat of the present system include unique elastomeric film characteristics that render the film flexible enough to compensate for expansion and contraction, as well as minor flexing of the surface without cracking or splitting of the system's film coat. Also, the system provides the surface with improved adhesion to any clean surface, a waterproof coat, and an ability to be repeatedly cleaned with commercially available household cleaners or soap and water. In addition, the system provides the surface with a protective coat that permits repeated cleaning of subsequently applied graffiti using a particular cleaning composition, without altering the surface or causing damage to any area in close proximity to the surface.In particular, the system provides an elastomeric protective film coat with extraordinary adhesive and micro non-porous waterproof and penetration resistant properties that permits the coat to encapsulate lead paint, graffiti and certain other contaminants (i.e. toxic paint, salt and the like) . The encapsulation prevents leaching or bleed-thru of the contaminant through the film coat. The coat also prevents permanent adhesion to, and or staining of, the 

 protective coat by future graffiti or other surface vandalism and defacing contaminants. It is anticipated that the system's protective film coat will also encapsulate asbestos.It has been found that the coat withstands multiple cleanings of subsequently applied graffiti with one or more
