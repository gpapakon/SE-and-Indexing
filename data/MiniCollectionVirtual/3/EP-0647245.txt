<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymers of 
haloperfluoro and perfluoro ethers, and to the 
preparation, fabrication and crosslinking of such 
polymers. Haloperfluoro and perfluoro mono- and 
polyethers which are ethylenically unsaturated can be 
homopolymerized or can be copolymerized with other 
ethylenically unsaturated monomers to form a melt 
processible, thermoplastic polymer. An advantageous feature of such ethers which 
contain two sites of unsaturation, both a vinyl and an 
allyl group for example, is that they can be polymerized 
through one bond to form a melt processible, 
thermoplastic polymer, while the other bond remains 
unreacted in a side chain. This unreacted bond is then 
available to participate in a crosslinking reaction 
which converts the thermoplastic polymer to a thermoset. U. S. Patent 3,397,191 discloses the formation 
of oligomers from divinyl fluorocarbon ethers, 
and the formation of polymers and copolymers 
from the oligomers. The oligomers are formed 
by the head-to-tail reaction of a vinyl group 
in two ether molecules to form a cyclobutyl 
ring.  
 In one aspect, this invention involves a 
homopolymer or copolymer of one or more of the ethers 
described by the formula CF2==CF--CF2--Q--O--CF==CF2, 
where Q is --Ga--(--O--C2J4--)b--(--O--Z--)c--, in which G 
is a substantially fluorinated C3-C7 alkyl radical; a 
is 0 or 1; each J is independently fluorine, chlorine, 
bromine, or a C1-C4 substantially fluorinated alkyl 
radical on which not more than one substituent is 
chlorine, provided that not more than two J's are nonfluorine 
halogen atoms; b is 0-6 inclusive; Z is a 
substantially fluorinated C2-C10 alkyl radical; and c is 
0 or 1; provided that sum of a + b + c is greater than 
0. In a further aspect, this invention involves a 
copolymer of one or more of said ethers and one or more 
other ethylenically unsaturated monomers. This 
invention also involves a process for crosslinking a 
polymer as described above, and involves an electrolyric 
cell containing a membrane prepared from such a polymer. The polymers of this invention are melt 
processible, thermoplastic polymers which can be molded, 
formed or fabricated into finished articles or other 
goods of virtually any variety, particularly for use in 
the automotive and electronics industries or for the 
manufacture of films, such as molded or extruded films 
used as membranes. The finished articles or other goods 
can be crosslinked to improve strength, elasticity and 
tear resistance. The polymers of this invention
