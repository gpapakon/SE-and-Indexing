<ABSTRACT>
The seed drill comprises a seed reservoir; a transverse row of carrying arms (4) which are articulated independently of one another by their respective front parts to a chassis via aligned shafts; a transverse row of furrow-opening tools each equipped with a seed-sowing coulter; and a transverse row of follower rollers mounted individually free to rotate on the carrying arms (4). The following rollers (8) of each pair are carried respectively by the end shafts (13, 14) of a double crank (15), the central shaft (16) of which turns in that one of the carrying arms (4) which is associated with this pair.

Seeder which comprises: a heavy chassis (1) adapted 
to be coupled to a tractor; a seed reservoir (3) mounted 

on the chassis (1); a transverse row of carrying arms 
(4) which are articulated independently of one another 

by their respective front parts on the chassis (1) by 
means of aligned shafts (5) and on the rear parts of 

which the chassis (1) is supported by springs (6); a 
transverse row of working tools (7) each provided with a 

counter-sower (9); and a transverse row of follower 
rollers (8) individually eccentrically mounted for 

rotation on the carrying arms (4);
 
and wherein the working tools (7) on the one hand and 

the follower rollers (8) on the other hand are arranged 
in pairs each of which is located on either side of the 

carrying arm (4) in question; the row of working tools 
(7) is located in front of the row of follower rollers 

(8); and each counter-sower (9) is linked to the seed 
reservoir (3) by a seed supply tube (10),
 
characterised in that the follower rollers (8) of each 

pair are carried respectively by the end shafts (13, 14) 
of a double crank (15) the central shaft (16) of which 

pivots relative to the one of the carrying arms (4) 
which is associated with this pair. 
Seeder according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the working tools (7) consist of discs associated with a 

counter-sower (9) and individually eccentrically mounted 
for rotation on the carrying arms (4). 
Seeder according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the front end shafts (13) of the 

double cranks (15) are all located on the same side of 
their respective carrying arms (4), the rear end shafts 

(14) all being located on the opposite side. 
Seeder according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the distance (D) be
tween the axis  
 

(Y) of the front end shaft (13) of each double crank 
(15) and the axis (X) of its central shaft (16) is 

greater than the distance (d) between this latter axis 
(X) and the axis (Z) of the rear end shaft (14) of this 

double crank (15). 
Seeder according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that each double crank (15) is shaped 

so that the geometric axis (X) of its central shaft (16) 
is located below the plane (P) passing through the 

geometric axes (Y, Z) of its end shafts (13) and (14). 
Seeder according to anny one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it comprises abutments (17, 18) 

intended to limit the oscillation of each double crank 
(15) about the axis (X) of its central shaft (16). 
Seeder according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the central shaft (16) of the 

double crank (15) pivots in a bearing (12a) attached to 
the carrying arm (4) by fixing means (2).
