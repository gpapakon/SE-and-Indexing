<ABSTRACT>
Frequency-modulated wave trains are used for target location by means of transmitted pulses and evaluation of received signals of the elements reflected by the target, with respect to direction, range and speed, the pulse length and bandwidth of the transmitted pulse being specified. The received signals are evaluated in Doppler channels, by calculation of the ambiguity function. In order to enable an increase in the accuracy of the speed determination while using the same number of Doppler channels, the frequency of the wave train within the bandwidth is calculated using an irrational function whose exponent has a value between 0 and 1. The smaller the value for the same pulse length, the greater is the Doppler sensitivity. This method for modulation of the wave train in the transmitted pulse can be used advantageously for location by means of sound waves and electromagnetic waves.

Method for recognising stationary and moving targets and/or
determining their target data with respect to speed and/or

transmitted and received, and received signals are
