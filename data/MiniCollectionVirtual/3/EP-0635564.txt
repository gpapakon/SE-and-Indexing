<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid detergent 
compositions containing an antifoam agent. More in particular, 
the present invention relates to liquid detergent compositions 
comprising a dispersible silicone antifoam agent. The present invention relates to a dispersible antifoam 
agent containing a silicone for incorporation into concentrated 
liquid detergents wherein the antifoam agent provides a stable, 
uniform detergent with controlled foaming behavior. A defoamer or antifoam agent is a material which, when 
added in low concentration to a foaming liquid controls the 
foam problem. The defoamer equilibrates the rate of foam  
 
collapse with the rate of foam formation. Such materials, in 
addition, remove unsightly and troublesome surface foam, 
improve filtration, watering, washing, and drainage, of various 
types of suspensions, mixtures, and slurries. Defoamers have 
found application traditionally in such areas of use as the 
pulp and paper industry, paints and latex, coating processes, 
fertilizers, textiles, fermentation processes, metal working, 
adhesive, caulk and polymer manufacture, the sugar beet 
industry, oil well cement, cleaning compounds, cooling towers, 
and in chemical processes of varied description, such as 
municipal and industrial primary and secondary waste water 
treatment facilities. It is essential for a defoamer that it be 
inert and not capable of reacting with the product or system in 
which it is used, and that it have no adverse affect on the 
product or system. The inclusion of a silicone defoamer or silicone antifoam 
agent in a liquid detergent is not new, however, it is 
uncommon. The reason is that it is particularly difficult to 
homogeneously disperse antifoam formulations into aqueous 
mediums such as liquid detergents. A liquid detergent is a 
complex chemical formulation and often the complexity of such 
formulations hinder a homogeneous dispersion of an antifoam 
composition in the detergent. The result is often loss of 
uniformity, as well as flocculates of antifoam accumulating at 
the surface of the detergent. One of the overriding trends of 
today is the move toward more concentrated liquid detergents. 
This shift offers the inherent efficiency of manufacture and 
use of liquid formulas, such as pumpability and easy measuring 
of liquids, while reducing the burden of packaging and shipping  
 
costs. This trend is occurring in both the consumer market 
products and in industrial formulations. The move toward concentrated liquids usually entails
