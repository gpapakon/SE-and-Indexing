 of from 5 to 200 µm, and 
the peel strength between the foamed thermoplastic resin 

sheet and the thermoplastic resin film is from 5 to 
400 g/25 mm width. The resin film is easily strippable from 

the foamed resin sheet with a reduced scatter in peeling 
strength, making the formings reusable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a separable foamed
thermoplastic resin laminate sheet having a strippable film,
a process for producing the same, and formings produced from
the sheet.Formings, such as trays and containers, prepared from
sheeting of foamed thermoplastic resins, such as foamed
polystyrene and foamed polyolefin, are used widely and in
large quantities for vegetables, meat, fishes or cooked foods
for their low cost and whiteness giving a clean feeling.In recent years, weight has been given to recycling
of these formings from the viewpoint of reduction of refuse
and resource saving. However, the inside surface of formings
collected after use are dirty and cannot be reclaimed as
such. Besides, trays or containers for perishables such as
raw noodles and hams are usually prepared from laminate
sheeting composed of a foamed resin sheet and a gas barrier
film in order to keep freshness. Such a laminate sheet
composed of different materials should be separated into each
material before reclaiming. For these reasons, recycling of
used formings has been difficult. In order to facilitate recycling of the formings, it
has been proposed to laminate a film on sheeting so that the
film can be stripped off the used formings without cleaning
the inside surface of the formings, as disclosed in JP-A-U-4-38942
(the term "JP-A-U" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese utility model application") and Japanese
Utility Model Application Nos. 16214/91 and 74081/92.
According to the proposals, a strippable film is laminated on
an foamed resin sheet with an adhesive, etc.However, the strippable film of the individual
formings proposed shows a large scatter in peeling strength,
that is, the adhesive strength varies depending on parts. As
a result, where a small strength thin film is used, it tends
to be torn during stripping. If the adhesion is weak, the
film is liable to be separated during use. If the adhesion
is strong, the film cannot be stripped off easily.An object of the present invention is to provide a
foamed thermoplastic resin laminate sheet comprising a
foamed thermoplastic resin sheet and a strippable
thermoplastic resin film, the strippable thermoplastic resin
film having a peeling strength with a small scatter.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a process for continuously and economically producing a
separable foamed thermoplastic resin laminate sheet by fusing 
and laminating a foamed thermoplastic resin sheet and a
strippable thermoplastic resin film.A further object of
