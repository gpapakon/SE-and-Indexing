<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rechargeable lithium cell which is adapted for 
use as a mobile power source and a power source for memory backup. The 
invention also relates to a process for making an anode particularly suitable for 
use in the rechargeable lithium cell. Recent progress of technology in the field of electronics expedites 
miniaturization of electronic devices. As a power source for such devices, there 
has been an increasing demand of cells which are small in size and light in 
weight with a high energy density. To this end, attention has been directed to 
rechargeable lithium cells using a lithium anode. Such cells have been studied 
worldwide. However, when a rechargeable lithium cell using metallic lithium as an 
anode is subjected to repeated charge and discharge cycles, there arise 
disadvantages as the lithium becomes partly divided into fine pieces during the 
cycles and as lithium dendrite grow on the surface of the anode. 
The anode thus becomes deformed and the cycle life of the cell becomes 
very short. In order to overcome the disadvantages, use of alloys and metal oxides as 
the anode has been investigated, including lithium and aluminium alloys, lead 
alloys occluding lithium therein, niobium pentoxide doped with lithium,  
 
titanium dioxide having an anatase crystal structure. Especially, for 
preventing the formation of lithium dendrite crystals, the metal oxides are 
superior to the alloys. Titanium dioxide exhibits a flat charge and discharge 
curve at a potential of approximately 1.5 V, with the great possibility that 
titanium oxide can be used as the anode of a rechargeable lithium cell. 
Alternatively, Japanese Patent Publication No. 63-1708 proposes the 
combination of an anode made of titanium oxide and a cathode made of 
manganese dioxide. However, the cell using such a combination as set forth 
above has not been put into practice yet because the potential is as low as 1 V 
and the cycle life is short. As is known in the art, titanium dioxide has several types of crystal 
structures including blue kite, anatase and rutile structures. Titanium 
dioxide having the anatase and rutile structures has been studied as the anode 
of the lithium cell as set out in "Electrochemistry 46. NO (1978) p. 407). The 
anatase structure exhibits a higher electrode capacity than the rutile 
structure and, thus, anatase-type titanium oxide has been rated highly. 
When used as the anode, anatase-type titanium oxide exhibits a 
higher capacity than rutile-type titanium dioxide.
