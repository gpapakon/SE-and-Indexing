<ABSTRACT>
A turret toolpost with transmission of epicycloidal type for lathes or 
the like comprising a crownwheel (15) driven by motor (12) via a gear 

(14) and radially geared to a unit (16) carrying satellites (17) via 
the satellites themselves which are in turn geared to a planetary gear 

(18) carrying rollers (21) for the axial operation of ring (7), there 
being furthermore provided means (32) of resistance to rotation capable 

of cooperating with a first circumferential profile (18d) with cams 
(18e, 18f) of planetary gear (18), controlled means (29, 134) and means 

(34, 134) capable of bringing about stoppage of rotation of shaft (6) 
and centring of fixed (2) and rotary (4) crownwheels respectively, such 

combination making it possible to implement the tool-changing cycle

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is an electromechanically-driven turret
toolpost with epicycloidal transmission with the driving motor rotating
continuously in the same direction during each tool-changing cycle, for
the programmed transfer in relation to a working position of one of
several tools carried by a plate of the said turret.It is known that the various machining operations on a large number of
workpieces require the use in succession, for the same workpiece, of
several tools according to a programmed and automatically controlled
sequence.To such end the workpiece is usually mounted on the lathe or like work-centre,
which is fitted with an auxiliary arrangement consisting of a
turret holding several tools arranged radially and/or frontally on a
rotary plate, which tools may from time to time be set in relation to
the working position by the controlled rotation of such plate, in order
to perform the required machining of the workpiece under the control of
an electronic unit.A basic requirement which arises in such operations is the reduction of
down time, in particular the time needed to undertake tool-changing and
resumption of machining of the workpiece.Such down time, named for convenience as "cycle time", is substantially
that required to enable the turret to execute all the movements capable
of setting the new tool in the working position.For this purpose, the turret requires an initial "opening time" to
become released from the fixed working position, a "rotation time" to 
turn in either direction according to the shortest distance, so as to
set the new tool in the working position, and a "closure time" to stop
and return to the locked condition.Such operations are performed, in known turrets, using mechanical
devices which transmit the rotation of a driving motor to the rotary
plate and at the same time control the operation of the means of
locking and unlocking, which have particularly complex and costly
structures through which the result of increasing the running speed of
the various moving parts of the turret is compromised by the fact that
it is not possible to differentiate the speed of rotation of the
internal parts of the turret from the speed of rotation of the plate
With such turrets of known type the possibility of reducing the cycle
time is substantially linked to the increase in the number of
revolutions of the driving motor, but such increase, in addition to
increasing the speed of the parts inside the turret for the unlocking
and relocking thereof, also brings about an
