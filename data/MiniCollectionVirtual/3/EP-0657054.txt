<ABSTRACT>
An electro-magnetic security/surveillance equipment comprising transmitting means (1, 3) encircling and defining at least one area (1) in which at least one security device (7) is contained. Said security device (7) may be supplied with energy from a capacitor or other EMF accumulating means (9a) being sustained or charged by aforesaid transmitting means (1, 3) via "pick-up"/antenna means (8) and rectifying means (9a). Aforesaid security device (7) may be releasably attached to the secured objects by attachment means (10). If aforesaid security device (7) is removed, across the boundary of aforesaid secured area (1), or if the attachment means (10) are tempered with, a reaction from said security device (7) is caused, said reaction being registered by detecting means (4, 5) making it possible to register the state of said security device and thus establish a desired reaction (6) e.g. an alarm.

<DESCRIPTION>
An Electro-magneticSecurity/Surveillance Equipment.The invention relates to an electromagnetic equipment for secur- ing/surveilling objects including the prevention of unauthorised removal or theft of displayed or stored merchandise e.g. in a shop or warehouse.The equipment comprises a device to be releasably attached to an object said device having transmitting means, if a removal of said device from said object is attempted the device emits a signal which may be registered by detection means.A known equipment for said purpose is described in WO 9009648. In said equipment a releasably attached device emits a radio frequency signal if removed from the object to which it is attached. The emitted signal is detected by a receiver said receiver causing an alarm. Said de¬ vice may further comprise a rebroadcast antenna and thus function as the traditional "tag"-systems on which the above mentioned patent is based. Said device does not comprise receiving means. Said device is primarily supplied from a battery.The function of the herein described equipment is significantly differ¬ ent from the function of the above mentioned, thus:At least one security device being releasably attached to the secured object is situated within at least one secured area said area being encir- cled and defined by at least one transmitting means generating a field said field may be continuous or not be continuous. (A continuous field is herein regarded as a not modulated field, likewise a not continuous field may herein be a modulated field).Said security device is equipped with at least one transmitting means and at least one receiving/detecting means.When the security device is removed from said area, at the boundaries of which the field strength is significantly changed, said change in field strength is registered by the receiving/detecting means of the security device causing the transmitting means of said security device to emit a signal, alternatively to cease emitting a signal. Likewise the security device may emit a signal, alternatively cease emitting a signal, if the 

attachment means is tampered with during an attempt to remove the security device from the secured object.Said signal, alternatively, the lack of said signal, is detected by detect¬ ing means thus making it possible to register the status of said security device and to establish a desired reaction e.g. an alarm. A capacitor or other EMF accumulating means may be charged and/or sus¬ tained via rectifying means from the receiving means of the security de¬

Claims:
CLAIM 1: (Fig. 1) Equipment for securing/surveying objects, including the prevention of unauthorised removal or theft of displayed or stored articles, e.g. in a shop or a warehouse, said equipment comprising a releasably attached secu¬ rity device (7) to be attached to an object said security device compris¬ ing a transmitter emitting a signal if said security device is removed from the object. The security device may be supplemented by a rebroadcast antenna.
CHARACTERISED by comprising at least one additional transmitting means (1, 3) encircling the area in which aforesaid releasably attached security de¬ vice is located and emitting a field in a defined area said field being detected (9) by said security device, comprising at least one receiving means, in a way that said security device emi ts a signal upon removal from said defined area due to the reduced strength of the field from said addi¬ tional transmitting means; the signal being emitted from said security de¬ vice is detected by detecting means (4, 5, 1 and/or 12) said detecting eans causing a reaction e.g. an alarm (6).
CLAIM 2: (Fig. 1)
Equipment for securing/surveying objects, including the prevention of unauthorised removal or theft of displayed or stored articles, e.g. in a shop or a warehouse, said equipment comprising a releasably attached secu¬ rity device (7) to be attached to an object said security device compris¬ ing a transmitter emitting a signal if said security device is removed from the object. The security device may be supplemented by a rebroadcast antenna. CHARACTERISED by comprising at least one additional transmitting means (1, 3) encircling the area in which aforesaid releasably attached security de¬ vice is located and emitting a field in a defined area said field being detected (9) by said security device, comprising at least one receiving means, in a way that said security device ceases to emit a signal upon re- moval from said defined area due to the reduced strength of the field from said additional transmitting means; the signal being emitted from said se¬ curity device is detected by detecting means (4, 5, 1 and/or 12) said de¬ tecting means causing a reaction e.g. an alarm (6).
