<ABSTRACT>
The intention is to enable a module for a membrane (diaphragm) safety valve for insertion in a valve housing to be manufactured in a simple and economical manner and to be used with different types of safety-valve housing. For this purpose, the module comprises a housing top part (14), a housing bottom part (10), a diaphragm (22) clamped between the housing top part (14) and the housing bottom part (10), a valve-closing member (30) connected to the diaphragm (22), a loading spring (48) which is arranged in the housing top part (14), acts on the valve-closing member (30) and is supported on a spring abutment (50), and a valve seat (40) which is provided on a tubular valve-seat body (32), is connected to the housing bottom part (10), can be inserted in a sealing manner in the safety-valve housing and interacts with the valve-closing member (30). In such a module, the connection between the module (112) and the safety-valve housing (114; 132) can be established simply by screwing the valve-seat body (32) directly into the safety-valve housing (114; 132). The housing bottom part (10) and the housing top part (14) are deep-drawn sheet-metal parts. The edge of the diaphragm (22) together with an edge (20) of the housing top part (14) can be connected to the housing bottom part (10) by being rolled in. The housing bottom part (10) has lateral openings (12) to allow the pressure medium to emerge when the safety valve responds. The valve-seat body (32) has, at its valve-seat end, a collar (34) which is gripped by a bent-over edge (38) of the housing bottom part (10).
