<ABSTRACT>
Such a housing consists of a tubular body (1) and a bottom (2) closing one end of the tubular body (1). An electrical or electromagnetic component (9, 11, 14, 13, 17) is arranged in the housing (1, 2). To protect the electrical or electromagnetic component (9, 11, 14, 13, 17) against damage in the event of shock or impact acting on the bottom (2) of the housing (1, 2), the bottom (2) is provided with raised portions (3, 18, 20, 7, 22, 24) which are constructed in the manner of stiffening ribs and which, starting from the centre area of the bottom (2), extend radially outwards in the direction of the outer edge of the bottom (2). Due to the stiffening effect of the ribs, the bottom can only become deformed by a very small amount during the action of shock or impact so that the space of the housing (1, 2) containing the electrical or electromagnetic component (9, 11, 14, 13, 17) is maintained in the manner of a safety cell.

Housing for an electrical or electromagnetic 
component, especially a sensor housing, having the 

following features: 

a) the housing consists of a tubular body (1) closed 
at its one end by a base (2); 
b) an electrical or electromagnetic component (9, 11, 
14, 13, 17) is arranged in the housing (1, 2); 
 
characterised in that the base (2, 28) has raised parts 

(3, 18, 20, 7, 22, 24, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38) which 
are constructed in the form of reinforcing ribs and 

which, starting from the middle region of the base (2, 
28), extend radially outwards towards the outer edge of 

the base (2, 28) and which are deformable in the manner 

of a crumple zone. 
Housing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the raised parts (3, 18, 20, 7, 22, 24) are formed 

by deformations of the base (2) of the housing that are 
created by pressing or embossing. 
Housing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the base (2) comprises a centrally arranged raised 

part (5), starting from which the raised parts (3, 18, 
20, 7, 22, 24) serving as reinforcing ribs extend 

radially outwards towards the outer edge of the base 
(2). 
Housing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the electrical or electromagnetic component (9, 

11, 14, 13, 17) is arranged in the housing (1, 2) so 
that a free space (6) remains between the base (2) and  

 
the electrical or electromagnetic component (9, 11, 14, 

13, 17). 
Housing according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a resiliently or 

plastically deformable damping agent (26) is arranged 
between the base (2) of the housing (1, 2) and the 

electrical or electromagnetic component (9, 11, 14, 13, 
17). 
Housing according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the damping agent is formed by a resiliently or 

plastically deformable casting compound. 
Housing according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the damping agent consists of a resiliently or 

plastically deformable disc. 
Housing according to at least one of the preceding 
claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the damping agent 

consists of a silicone gel. 
Housing according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the housing (1, 2) 

consists of a metallic material. 
Housing according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the tubular body (1) of 

the housing (1, 2) and the centrally arranged raised 
part (5) of the base (2) have a higher degree of 

hardness than the region of the base (2) extending from 
the raised part or depressed area (5) towards the 

tubular body (1). 
Housing according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the base (2) is  

 
constructed to bow away from the interior of the 

housing. 
Housing according to at least one of the preceding 
claim 1, characterised in that the raised parts (3, 18, 

20, 7, 22, 24, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38) are located on 
the side of the base (2, 28) facing towards the 

interior of the housing (1, 2).

20, 7, 22, 24, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38) are located on 
the side of the base (2, 28) facing away from the 

interior of the housing (1, 2). 
Housing according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the housing consists of 

plastics material and the raised parts in the form of 
reinforcing ribs are formed by mouldings (27, 30, 32,

Housing according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by the following features: 


a) the housing (1, 2) comprises a transitional region
