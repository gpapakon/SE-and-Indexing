<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device, preferably a laser device such 
as a signal generator, a signal amplifier or a signal 

detector e.g. a distributed feedback laser, which is 
implemented in III/V semiconductors. Such devices often 

require a barrier layer to encourage current flow to pass 
through the localised p/n-interface and this invention 

provides the barrier layer in the form of a layer of hole 
trapping semiconductor material located between and in contact 

with two p-type layers. III/V semiconductors contain at 
least one of indium, gallium and aluminium and at least one of 

phosphorus and arsenic but the preferred devices are laser 
devices implemented in various types of indium phosphide 

except for the active zone wherein photons are generated. The 

active zone is preferably formed of ternary and/or quaternary 
semiconductors. In the preferred structures the barrier layer 

is formed of chromium doped indium phosphide which is located 
between two layers of p-type indium phosphide. Alternative 

structures have (a) titanium doped indium phosphide between 
two layers of p-type indium phosphide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor devices and 
especially to laser structures which structures include barrier 
regions to regulate the flow of electric current in order to 
enhance the performance of the device. The invention includes purely electronic devices, which 
utilise a barrier layer in order to preferentially channel 
current through an active region. However, the preferred 
devices are laser devices in which the barrier layers modify the 
flow of current in order to improve the efficiency, eg. the 
efficiency of conversion of electric power into radiated power. 
The barrier has a secondary effect in that the laser device is 
able to operate at higher rates of modulation. The laser devices mentioned above can be utilised to carry 
out a variety of different telecommunications and signalling 
functions. For example, the laser device can be utilised to generate 
optical signals. For this application, the laser device needs to 
be associated with a reflective or resonating structure which 
returns photons into the active region in order to sustain the 
lasing process. Resonating systems which are highly wavelength 
selective are particularly appropriate since they narrow the 
bandwidth of the optical signals which are generated. External 
resonating systems may be utilised or the resonating system may 
be incorporated into the lasing structure, eg. as in a 
distributed feedback laser. Cleaved facets, as in Fabry-Perot 
lasers may also be used for feedback. The laser device may also be utilised for other signalling 
and telecommunication functions, e.g. optical amplifiers and 
optical detectors. In devices of this nature reflections are 
undesirable since they tend to produce noise. Therefore, it is 
appropriate to provide the lasing device with anti-reflection 
coatings in order to reduce, and ideally to eliminate, 
reflections. From the above description, it will be recognised that 
there are a wide variety of electronic and opto-electronic  
 
semiconductor devices which require barrier layers to control 
the flow of current. In particular, it is necessary to provide 
barrier layers in semiconductor devices wherein the 
semiconductors contain at least one of indium, gallium and 
aluminium and at least one of phosphorus and arsenic. In 
addition to the five major elements just mentioned the 
semiconductors also contain small quantities of dopants in order 
to confer particular electrical properties, eg. p-type 
conduction or n-type conduction. Semiconductor structures
