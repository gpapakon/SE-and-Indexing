<ABSTRACT>
A process for the synthesis of 1-O-steroidal-peracyl- beta -glycosides that provides greater  beta -anomeric selectivity with reduced by-products and side reactions. The process comprises reacting heptaacyl-D-cellobiosyl-1-halide, tetraacyl-D-glucosyl-1-halide or tetraacyl-D-galactosyl-1-halide and a trisubstituted silyl-3-O-steroid, wherein the steroid is tigogenin, hecogenin, 11-ketotigogenin, diosgenin, or cholesterol, in the presence of zinc fluoride under suitable conditions. Typically, the halide is bromide, chloride or fluoride, the acyl is alkanoyl(C1-C6), benzoyl or toluoyl and the silyl substitution is alkyl(C1-C6), phenyl or phenyl alkyl(C1-C6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for the synthesis of steroidal 
glycosides, and particularly to the preparation of steroidal peracyl glycosides used as 
intermediates therein. Tigogenin beta-O-cellobioside is a known compound having utility in the 
treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis (Malinow, U.S. Patents 4,602,003 
and 4,602,005; Malinow et al., Steroids, vol. 48, pp. 197-211, 1986). Each patent 
discloses a different synthesis of this compound from alpha-D-cellobiose octaacetate; 
the first via the glycosyl bromide heptaacetate which is coupled with tigogenin in the 
presence of silver carbonate, and finally hydrolyzed; and the second via direct stannic 
chloride catalyzed coupling of the cellobiose octaacetate with tigogenin in methylene 
chloride, again followed by hydrolysis. In Malinow et al., reaction of cellobiose 
octaacetate with titanium tetrabromide gave the cellobiosyl bromide heptaacetate, which 
was coupled with tigogenin by means of mercuric cyanide, and then hydrolyzed. All 
of these methods have serious drawbacks for producing bulk material to be used as 
a pharmaceutical drug. A desirable goal, met by the present invention, has been to 
devise synthetic methods which avoid toxic and/or expensive reagents, and which 
cleanly produce the desired tigogenin beta-O-cellobioside, avoiding tedious and 
expensive purification steps. Schmidt, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., vol. 25, pp. 212-235 (1986) has reviewed 
the synthesis and reactions of O-glycosyl trichloroacetimidates formed by the reaction 
of sugars possessing a 1-hydroxy group (but with other hydroxy groups protected, e.g., 
by benzyl or acetyl) with trichloroacetonitrile in the presence of a base. There is 
preferential formation of the alpha-anomer when sodium hydride is used as base, and 
preferential formation of the beta-anomer when the base is potassium carbonate. The 
alpha anomer of tetrabenzylglucosyl trichloroacetimidate when coupled with cholesterol 
gave anomeric mixtures which varied with catalyst (p-toluenesulfonic acid or boron 
trifluoride etherate) and temperature (40 to +20°C). On the other hand, both the alpha  
 
and beta anomers of tetraacetylglucosyl analog reportedly yielded exclusively beta-anomeric 
products. Helv. Chim.Acta, 68(1), 283-7 (1985) describes the stereoselective glycosylation of 
alcohols and silyl ethers using glycosyl fluorides and boron trifluoride etherate. Steroids, 52(3), 265-78 (1988) relates to glucosylations of pregn-5-ene-3β, 20R-diol. Tet.Lett., 25(13),
