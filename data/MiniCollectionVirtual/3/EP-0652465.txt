<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cameras 
for recording digital and pictorial images. Still camera users frequently desire to 
enhance or document individual pictures, with 
supplementary information, such as captions or brief 
audio segments that can be conveniently accessed 
during viewing of the image. The need for audio 
segments has been previously recognized, for 
example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,920,862 which teaches 
a method of recording sound magnetically in 
association with still pictures. Nonetheless, such 
camera systems are not in common use today, owing to 
the fact that most methods suffer disadvantages due 
to cumbersome peripheral recording devices, 
specialized data storage systems, and/or cumbersome 
playback systems, and to the difficulty of 
synchronizing these functions with image display 
(see for example U.S. Patent No. 5,128,700). 
Recording of sound directly on film eliminates the 
need for separate storage means but may require 
specialized film layers, such as magnetic layers. 
Also, previous camera systems have been restrictive 
in the type of non-pictorial information recorded 
and presented upon viewing, being aimed primarily at 
sound or at simple bar code frame identification and 
not utilizing the full color spectral imaging 
capability of films. The information density so 
recorded is typically very low. In view of the foregoing discussion, it is 
an object of this invention to provide a camera 
system which expands on the amount and type of non-pictorial  
 
information which is available to and 
which by may be captured by photographic camera 
users. Another object is to provide the camera 
user with the option of using any proportion of film 
space for the purpose of non-pictorial information 
recording; to apprise the user of the amount and 
type of information he has chosen for recording, and 
the percentage of film occupied by this information, 
and to enable enhanced modes of non-pictorial 
information display. It is a further object of this invention 
to provide camera users with a way to trade "picture 
space" on film for non-pictorial information space 
(for example extended audio narration, text, 
numerical tables, etc.) without requiring costly and 
cumbersome hardware additions such as, for example, 
the tape recorders and players that have been 
previously employed with cameras to record audio. These objects are achieved in a 
photographic camera system for recording images of a 
subject in a first location on a photographic film, 
the improvement
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
In a photographic camera system for 
recording images of a subject in a first location on 

a photographic film, the improvement comprising: 

a) means for advancing the film; 
b) optical recording means disposed in 
proximity to the camera exposure gate including a 

plurality of selectively activated LEDs and 
waveguide means for conducting light from the 

emitters to the film as the film is advanced by the 
film adva
ncing means so that digital information 
such as digital audio information is recorded in a 

second location on the film spaced from the first 
location; 
c) means for optically projecting an 
image of a subject onto the film to record such 

image in the first location; and 
d) means for selectively energizing the 
LEDs at different light levels to provide multilevel 

gray scale information recorded on the film. 
The invention of claim 1 further 
including means for indicating the amount of film 

used for digital and pictorial recording. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein the 
light emitters are gallium arsenide phosphide LEDs 

and the waveguide means includes diffused glass. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein the 
light emitters are organic electroluminescent 

devices deposited on waveguide arrays. 
The invention of claim 1 in which the 
lines of digital information is synchronized with 

the speed of the film advance means. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein the 
recording of digital information occurs during 

rewind as well as advance direction of film motion. 
The invention of claim 1 further 
including means of synchronizing recording of 

digital data with motion of the film during the 
recording process. 
The camera of claim 1 further 
including means for storing digital information and 

means responsive to such stored information for 
selectively activating the light emitters, means for 

buffering and for verifying the integrity of the 
digital information selectively recorded by the 

activated light emitters prior to recording. 
The camera of claim 3 wherein a 
multiplicity of light emitters, at least some of 

which produce light of different colors of the 
visible spectrum, selectively provide spatially 

overlapping multilevel digital information. 
The invention of claim 1 further 
including a source or sources of digital information 

spaced from the camera and means in the camera for 
selecting, acquiring, and storing digital 

information from such source or sources.
