<ABSTRACT>
A keyboard instrument selectively enters into an 
acoustic sound mode for performing a music with acoustic 

piano sounds and an electronic sound mode for performing a 
music with synthetic sounds, and a rotary stopper (2c) is 

provided between hammer shanks (1t) and strings (1d) for 
interrupting a rotation of the hammer (1u) toward the 

strings in the electronic sound mode; wherein a cushion 
(2f) is provided on the rotary stopper for damping an 

impact of a damper (1x) leaving from the strings (1d) in 
both acoustic and electronic sound modes so that a player 

can perform a music without a noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a keyboard instrument and,
more particularly, to a keyboard instrument selectively
entering into an acoustic sound mode and an electronic
sound mode through a rotation of a stopper.A typical example of a muffler incorporated in the
acoustic piano is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Publication of Unexamined Application (Kokai) No. 51-67732.
According to the Japanese Utility Model Publication, if a
player manipulates the muffler, the hammer concurrently
strikes the associated strings and the muffler, and the
strings faintly vibrate for producing an acoustic tone. As
a result, the player performs a music with soft tones,
because the muffler decreases the volume of the acoustic
tones.However, the muffler disclosed in the Japanese
Utility Model Publication does not allow a player to
perform a music in perfectly silent environment. DE-C-8222 discloses a piano having a hammer shank
stopper which is rotatable between a free position and a
blocking position.Further, DE-C-37 07 591 discloses a piano having a
hammer shank stopper which is rotatable between a free
position and a blocking position, and was used as a basis
for the preamble of claim 1.In addition, shank stoppers were proposed in
Japanese Patent 
Application No. 4-174813 filed on June 9, 1992 which formed
a part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/073,092 and
European Patent Application No. 93109211.8. The Japanese
Patent Application was not published on the priority date
of the present application. The shank stoppers cause
hammer shanks to rebound thereon before strikes against
strings, and keep the strings silent in a silent mode. One
of the shank stoppers has cushion members opposed to the
damper wires in the silent mode. In this instance, when a
player depresses a key in the silent mode, the associated
hammer assembly is restricted by the shank stopper on the
way toward the strings, and the damper wire is brought into
contact with the cushion member. For this reason, not only
the impact of the hammer shank but also the impact of the
damper wire are extinguished in the silent mode, and the
player can practice a fingering on the keyboard in
perfectly silent environment.However, the shank stopper does not guarantee the
noiseless action of the damper wire in an acoustic sound
mode or a mechanically sound producing mode. In the
acoustic sound mode, the hammer heads strike the strings,
and the strings vibrate for producing piano tones. Even if
the damper wires hit the shank stopper, the noise is faint, 
and is liable to

<CLAIMS>
A keyboard instrument having at least an acoustic
sound mode for producing acoustic sounds and an electronic

sound mode for producing electronic sounds, comprising:

a) an acoustic piano (1; 100) having

a-1) a keyboard (1a) implemented by a plurality of
swingable keys (1g) depressed by a player in both acoustic

sound and electronic sound modes, notes of a scale being
assigned to said plurality of swingable keys,
a-2) a plurality of key action mechanisms (1b)
respectively linked with said plurality of swingable keys

(1g), and selectively actuated by depressed keys of said
keyboard (1a) in both acoustic sound and electronic sound

modes,
a-3) a plurality of hammer assemblies (1c)
respectively associated with said plurality of key action

mechanisms (1b), and selectively driven for rotation by
actuated key action mechanisms linked with said depressed

keys in both acoustic sound and electronic sound modes,
said actuated key action mechanisms and the associated

hammer assemblies producing a piano key-touch in both
acoustic sound and electronic sound modes,
a-4) a plurality of string means (1d) respectively
associated with said plurality of hammer assemblies (1c), 

and selectively struck by hammer assemblies driven by said
actuated key action mechanisms in said acoustic sound mode

for producing said acoustic sounds, and
a-5) a plurality of damper mechanisms (1b) respectively
associated with said plurality of string means (1d) for

damping vibrations thereon, and driven by said depressed
keys for leaving from the associated string means, thereby

allowing the associated string means to vibrate;
b) an electronic sound generating system (3) enabled in
said electronic sound mode for producing said electronic

sounds having notes identified by said depressed keys; and
c) a mode controlling system (2; 200) having

c-1) a rotatable stopper means (2d/2e; 202/ 203/ 204)
provided between said plurality of key action mechanisms

(1b) and said plurality of string means (1d), and angularly
movable between a blocking position (BP) and a free

position (FP), and
c-2) a driving means (2b) associated with said
rotatable stopper means for changing said stopper means

hammer assemblies striking said string means without an

interruption of said stopper means in said free position, 
said hammer assemblies rebounding on said

stopper means in said blocking position without a strike

c-3) a shock absorbing means (2f; 205) provided on said
rotatable stopper means, and opposed to said plurality of

damper mechanisms in both acoustic and electronic sound
modes, so as to receive damper mechanisms associated with said depressed Keys when damper mechanisms are lifted off from said associated string means, thereby decreasing impact of damper mechanisms

shaft member for absorbing impacts of said hammer
