<ABSTRACT>
A combination of an electronic semiconductor 
device (13') comprising a metal plate (21') and a 

plastics body (20') which encapsulates the metal plate 
leaving at least a major surface (21a) thereof exposed, 

a heat sink (10'), and means of fastening the heat sink 
to the device is disclosed. 
To enable securement of the heat sink on the 
device without any external fastening arrangement 

having to be used, and without unduly straining the 
solder spot of the device pins to a printed circuit, 

the device is provided with undercut regions (22') on 
opposite sides adjacent to the exposed surface (21a) of 

the plate for releasable engagement by the fastening 
means (11').

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mounting structures 
for electronic circuits, and in particular, to a 
combination of an electronic semiconductor device 
having a plastics body which includes a metal plate 
with a major portion of its surface left exposed, and a 
heat sink attached to the electronic device so as to be 
in contact with the exposed surface portion of the 
plate. An electronic semiconductor device of the 
kind outlined above is a composite structure typically 
adapted to accommodate an integrated circuit thereon. 
As is known, an integrated circuit is implemented on a 
die (chip) of a semiconductor material having a surface 
area of a few square millimeters, and requires, for its 
connection to an external circuit such as a printed 
circuit on a board made of an insulating material, a 
special holding structure which also enables the 
circuit to be interconnected electrically. A known 
structure that fills this demand is basically comprised 
of a plastics body enclosing the chip, the chip being 
connected, as by thin wire leads soldered to purposely 
provided metallized areas of its surface, to 
corresponding terminal conductors led out of the 
plastics body. In the instance of power integrated  
 
circuits, that is devices designed to operate on 
comparatively large currents and accordingly liable to 
become heated to a considerable extent, such structures 
further include a metal plate whereby the chip secured 
thereon can transfer the heat developed during its 
operation to the outside. The manufacture of the last-named structures 
provides for the plate to be formed from sheet metal, 
e.g. a copper sheet, by a blanking process; the chip is 
then attached to the metal plate either by a soldering 
process using a low melting point solder, such as a 
lead-tin solder, or by gluing using a suitable 
adhesive, such as an epoxy-based adhesive; thereafter, 
a set of metal strips intended to form the device pins 
or terminal conductors, and which have been blanked off 
sheet metal but are still held together by 
interconnecting bridge portions, are mounted on the 
plate in an electrically isolated fashion therefrom; 
thin wires, usually golden wires, are then soldered 
with one end to the metallized areas of the chip using 
a low melting point solder, and with the other end, to 
the ends of the metal strips by a process wherein heat 
and ultrasound are applied simultaneously; 
subsequently, the whole is placed in a suitable mold 
whereinto a plastics material, such as a thermosetting  
 
epoxy resin,

Combination of an electronic semiconductor 
device (13') comprising a metal plate (21') and a 

plastics body (20') encapsulating the metal plate to 
leave at least a major surface (21a) thereof 

substantially exposed, a heat sink (10'), and fastening 
means (11') effective to hold a surface (10a) of the 

heat sink in heat-conduction contact with the exposed 
surface (21a) of the metal plate, characterized in that 

the device has undercut regions (22') on opposite sides 
adjacent to said exposed surface (21a), and that the 

fastening means (11') releasably engage the undercut 
regions (22'). 
Combination according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that each of the undercut regions 

(22') comprises an edge area of the metal plate (21') 
surface opposite from the exposed surface (21a). 
Combination according to either Claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the fastening means comprise a 

clip (11') in the form of a shaped strip of spring 
steel having a middle portion (11b') adapted to engage 

a central region of the heat sink which is opposite 
from the surface of heat-conduction contact with the 

exposed surface (21a) of the plate (21') and ends 
adapted to engage the undercut regions (22'), thereby  

 
pushing the heat sink (10') against the exposed surface 

(21a) of the plate. 
Combination according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the electronic 

semiconductor device has a plurality of electric 
contact terminals (13b') led out from opposite sides of 

the plastics body adjacent to the exposed surface of 
the plate, said terminals being soldered to a printed 

circuit board (12'). 
Combination according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the 

plurality of electric contact terminals (23) are 
bent in the opposite direction to ones whose end portions locate substantially 

in the same plane as the exposed surface of the plate 
(21) 

and 
whereby the exposed surface of  

 
the plate (21,21') locates on the opposite side from 

the device mounting face to the printed circuit board 
and the undercut regions engaged by the fastening means 

(14') of the heat sink (10') are formed by the edge 
areas (22,22') of the plate (21,21').
