<ABSTRACT>
The lower path of movement (25) of clamping heads (6) of a loading device (1) is straightened by means of a cam control (14), the cam control (14) being located on the side of the associated lift mounting (7) facing away from the clamping heads (6). As a result, by means of only a single lift drive (19), the loading device (1) can be transferred into a feed position (26), in which a roll (21) can be supplied axially in an unimpeded manner, after which the clamping heads (6) can be lowered and, without a transverse movement of the roll, brought into engagement with the latter, without this being opposed by the respective axis height (23, 24) of the roll (21, 22).
