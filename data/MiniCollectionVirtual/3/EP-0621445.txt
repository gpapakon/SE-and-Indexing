<ABSTRACT>
The built-in screen projector consists of a cylindrical reflector housing 1 and a fastening ring 2 for fastening in a ceiling opening. Locking columns (10) which project inwardly are constructed on the fastening ring, on which locking columns locking slides (13) are arranged which are guided on the associated locking column (10) such that they can be displaced upwards and downwards and have on one side a manually operated clamping part (19) for clamping the locking slide in any desired position. Combining the locking columns and the associated locking slides and the clamping parts makes it possible to fasten and release again the ceiling luminaire in a simple manner in a corresponding ceiling opening. No tools are required.

<CLAIMS>
Ceiling built-in radiator with a cylindrical reflector casing (1) and a 
fastening ring (2) for fastening in a ceiling opening, on which are constructed 

inwardly projecting fixing columns (10), to which can be fixed 
retaining fittings with a support flange (14) resting on the inside on the 

ceiling (5), the retaining fittings being constructed as blocking slides (13), 
which are guided in upwardly and downwardly slidable manner on the associated 

fixing column (10), characterized in that they have on one side a manually 
operable clamping part (17 to 19) for fixing the blocking side (13) in a random 

position, that each fixing column (10) and the adjacent surface of the 
associated blocking slide (13) are provided with a tooth system (11, 16) 

and that on the opposite surface of the blocking slide (13) is pivotably mounted 
at (18) an eccentric lever (17 to 19) forming the clamping part and whose 

eccentric surface is supported on the adjacent surface of the fixing column 
(10). 
Ceiling built-in radiator according to claim 1, characterized in that on 
each blocking slide (13) in the built-in position above the clamping part 

(eccentric lever 17 to 19) is constructed a sliding grip (15).
