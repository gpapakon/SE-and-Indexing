<ABSTRACT>
The optical unit (54) forms an electrostatic latent
image by applying scanning light onto the photosensitive

member (65) charged by the charger device (66) from
above at an angle. The developing device (67) forms a

toner image by developing the electrostatic latent image
formed on the photosensitive member (65) with toner.

The transfer charger device (70) transfers the toner
image formed on the photosensitive member (65) onto a

transfer charger sheet. The main body (51) accommodates
the sheet feeding section (53) at a rear section, and

the optical unit (54) in front of the feeding section
(53), which are vertically arranged. The photosensitive

member (65) and the developing device (67) are
integrated into the image formation unit (64), which is

detachably set in the upper section of the main body
(51). The toner box (68) of the developing unit (67)

has a rear surface portion shaped to correspond to the
optical unit (54), and a front surface portion shaped to

correspond to an optical path through which the scanning
light output from the optical unit (54) is applied onto

the photosensitive surface of the electrostatic latent
image carrier (65).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image formation 
apparatus of an electrophotographic system, comprising 
an electrostatic latent image carrier such as a photosensitive 
drum, for use in a laser printer, a copying 
machine, etc. An image forming apparatus of an electrophotographic 
system, which comprises an electrostatic 
latent image carrier, for example, a photosensitive 
drum, has the structure in which a charge device, an 
exposure device, a development unit, a transfer changer 
device and a discharge device are arranged around the 
photosensitive drum. In this image formation apparatus, the photosensitive 
surface of the photosensitive drum is charged 
uniformly by the charge device while rotating the drum. The charged photosensitive surface of the drum is 
exposed to scanning light from an optical unit provided 
in the exposure device, thereby forming an electrostatic 
latent image on the surface. The electrostatic latent 
image is developed by toner applied thereon from the 
development unit so as to be visualized as a toner 
image. The toner image is transferred on an image transfer 
sheet by the transfer charger device. The image  
 
transfer sheet to which the toner image has been transferred, 
is heated and pressed by a heat fixation device 
for fixation of the image. Such an image formation apparatus is disclosed in, 
for example, Jap. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
No. 4-51257, or Jap. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
No. 3-249766. According to Jap. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication 
No. 4-51257, the apparatus body 1 is divided into the 
upper body 1a and the lower body 1b, as shown in FIG. 9. The upper body 1a has an image formation case 8 
which further includes an optical writing device 2, a 
photosensitive drum 3, a charger device 4, a development 
device 5, a cleaning device 6 and a discharger device 7. The lower body 1b contains a transfer charger 
device 9, a fixation device 10 and a conveyer path 11. 
The lower body 1b further includes a sheet feeding tray 
13 detachably provided on the outer side of the conveying 
path 11, and in the tray, sheets 12 are stored. The upper and lower bodies 1a and 1b of the apparatus 
body 1 placed one on the other such that one end 
side can be opened while the other end side is hinged. In the image formation apparatus having the above-described 
structure, the jamming of a sheet 12 on the 
conveyance path 11, the transfer charger device 9 or the 
fixation device 10 occurs in some cases. When it 
occurs, the upper and lower bodies 1a and 1b are opened,
