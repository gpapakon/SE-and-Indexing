<ABSTRACT>
A method and a foamed resin molding in which a skin 
layer is formed by pressing an expansible
 film against and 
into conformity with cavity walls of a mold or a bag-like cover 

member by foaming pressure of a foamable resin and a 
foamed resin body molded concurrently and integrally under 

the skin layer, which facilitate the easy parting of the 
moldings from the mold without parting agent.
