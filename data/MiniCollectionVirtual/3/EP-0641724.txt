<ABSTRACT>
A device for closing containers, in particular cans, is described, having a nozzle-shaped neck (1) which is or can be fixed on the container and is provided at its upper end with an external screw thread (2), and having a lid (3) which can be screwed onto the screw thread, the neck (1) and lid (3) having one or more interlocking devices (4, 5) which engage releasably in one another. The interlocking devices (4, 5) on the neck (1) and the lid (3) are formed in each case below the screw thread (2) in the direction towards the container, the interlocking devices (4, 5) on the lid (3) being designed to be rigid and on the neck (1) being designed to be elastically reversibly deformable, and the interlocking devices (4) on the neck (1) having such a longitudinal extent in the direction towards the container that they protrude beyond the lid (3) when said lid has been fitted on, thus resulting in pressure points (D) which allow the interlocking devices (4, 5) to be disengaged. The containers having the device are also described.
