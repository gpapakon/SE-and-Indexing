<ABSTRACT>
The machine has a corrugation roller (3) and a parallel sizing roller (22) spaced apart by a sizing gap (30), which is adjusted by application of a pressure force on the bearing (27) of the sizing roller in the direction of the corrugation roller bearing (33), under control of a calibration device (37 with a force measuring device (41) indicating a drop in bearing force upon contact between the corrugation roller and the sizing roller.. An Independent claim for a calibrating method for a corrugated paper web manufacturing machine is also included.
