<ABSTRACT>
A cotelomer of -CH₂CF₂- (VDF) units and CF₂CF(CF₃)- (HFP) 
units characterised in that the VDF units comprise at least 33% 

of all VDF and HFP units in the cotelomer combined. Also 
claimed is a process for preparing a cotelomer in the liquid 

state comprising reacting (A) a bromine geminal telogen having 
the general formula RC(R')Br₂ wherein R and R' are selected from 

the group consisting of F and perfluorinated alkyl radicals 
having 1 to 8 carbon atoms; (B) 1,1-difluoroethene, and (C) 

hexafluoropropene, the molar ratio of said components 
(A):(B):(C) being x:1:1 to x:1:5, in which x is 1 to 5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cotelomers of 
vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropene. More particularly 
the invention relates to cotelomers having a high 
hexafluoropropene content and prepared by reacting the 
above mentioned flouroolefin monomers with specific 
telogens having geminal bromine radicals. Telomerization of 1,1-difluoroethene, herein also 
referred to as vinylidene fluoride (VDF), using various 
telogens is well known. However, the corresponding 
telomerization of hexafluoropropene (HFP) is quite 
difficult. Moreover, cotelomerization of HFP with other 
more reactive fluoroolefins, such as CH₂=CF₂ (VDF), 
CF₂=CFCl, CF₂=CFH or CF₂=CF₂, results in very low 
proportions of HFP units in the final cotelomers. Thus, for 
example, few units of HFP are found in the product when this 
latter monomer is reacted with one of the aforementioned 
fluoroolefins using a telogen selected from such structures 
as CF₃CFClI; Rf-CR'FI, in which Rf is F, CF₃ or a fluoroalkyl 
radical having from 1 to 14 carbons and R' is Rf or 
Cl; I(C₂F₂)nI, in which n = 1 to 4; or a telechelic telogen 
of the formula (C₂F₄) (CF₂-CFR''I)₂, in which R'' is CF₃ or 
Cl. In U.S. 4,810,765 there have been disclosed 
cotelomers of vinylidene fluoride with fluorinated olefins 
having the general formula 
R-(CF₂CH₂)n(C₃F₆)m(C₂F₄)p(C₂F₃Cl)q-Br the units with n, m, 
p, q indices being randomly distributed along the telomer 
chain, R denoting a linear or branched C₁₋₂₀ alkyl group, 
optionally containing halogen, esters or ether groups and 
wherein n is an integer from 1 to 30, m from 0 to 10, p and 
g from 0 to 20 provided m+p+g is at least 1. The examples  
 
of U.S. 4,810,765 do not, however, show a cotelomer of VDF 
and HFP which contains a mole % of HFP units greater than 
26.6% based on the number of VDF and HFP units (see e.g. 
Example 5). There is a continuing need to provide 
cotelomers of VDF and HFP units wherein higher propoprtions 
of HFP units are present. Such a cotelomer which contains 
a high proportion of HFP units is desirable since this unit 
imparts structural disorder to the molecule, thereby 
reducing its tendency to crystalize and allowing its use in 
low temperature applications. It has now been surprisingly found that cotelomers of 
HFP and VDF containing a high proportion of HFP units can 
be prepared by cotelomerizing these two monomers using 
certain bromine geminal telogens employed in particular 
molar ratios of telogen:VDF:HFP. Cotelomers containing at 
least 33 mole percent HFP units can thus be
