<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a robot arm for a portal robot, with a working head (22) which is movable in three linear directions (X,Y,Z) and about two axes of rotation (a, c), and with a tool (A) which is provided on the working head and is intended for grasping bound stacks (K) of flat cardboard blanks by means of a suction device (11, 12) placed on the upper side of the stack and a pivotable underside-gripping device (13), the robot arm having the following distinguishing features: the mechanical coupling between the working head and the tool separable therefrom is effected via a multi-jaw chuck (M) which is provided on the working head and grasps a cylindrical surface of the tool; during the mechanical coupling between the working head and the tool, the connection of the suction device to a low-pressure source is effected by means of plug-in couplings (3) which are connected to said suction device via flexible lines (4); a pushing device (33) provided on the working head actuates the underside-gripping device of the tool via a lever arrangement (16, 6, 7, 34).

Robot arm (18) of an area-covering gantry robot, 

a) having a working head (22), 
b) which is movable in three linear directions and about two 
axes of rotation, and 
c) having a tool (A), provided on the working head (22), for 
grasping banded stacks (K) of flat cardboard blanks by 

means of a suction device (11, 12), placed on the upper 
side of the stack and connected to a low-pressure source, 

and a pivotable gripping-under device (13),
 
characterised by the following features: 
d) the mechanical coupling between the working head (22) and 
the tool (A) separable therefrom is effected by way of a 

multi-jaw chuck (F) which is provided on the working head 
(22) and grips a cylindrical surface (2) of the tool (A); 
e) in the case of the mechanical coupling between the working 
head (22) and the tool (A), the suction device (11, 12) is 

connected to the low-pressure source by means of plug-in 
couplings (3) connected to said suction device by way of 

flexible lines (4); and 
f) a pushing device (33) which is provided on the working head 
(22) and actuates the gripping-under device (13) of the 

tool (A) by way of a lever device (16, 6, 7, 34). 
Robot arm according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
multi-jaw chuck (F) is an internally gripping chuck suitable for 

picking up reels (B). 
Robot arm according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the pushing device (33) is an annular 

pusher (33) suitable for pushing off reels. 
Robot arm according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the coupling of the working head (22) to the tool is 

effected by a positive and/or non-positive connection between the  
 

multi-jaw chuck (F), in particular a three-jaw chuck, and a 
hollow cylinder (2) on the tool (A). 
Robot arm according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the tool (A) has a clamping and centring ring (2), which 

is fastened to a base plate (1) and has at least two centring 
pins (14), and in that the base plate (1) is fastened to a 

bracket (5) accommodating the lever device for the actuation of 
the gripping-under device (13). 
Robot arm according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the suction device has suction heads (12) resiliently 

mounted with a relatively large amount of play. 
Robot arm according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the suction device has three suction plates (11), which 

are each equipped with plug-in couplings (3) and each have a 
plurality of suction heads (12) individually drivable by low 

pressure, for picking up three stacks of cardboard blanks (K). 
Robot arm according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that, for gripping under the three stacks of cardboard blanks 

(K), for each stack a respective individually drivable gripping-under 
device (13) is provided on the tool (A). 
Robot arm according to either of Claims 7 and 8, 
characterised in that the suction plates (11) and the gripping-under 

devices (13) are horizontally displaceable relative to one 

another in accordance with the size of the stacks (K) to be 
handled. 
Robot arm according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that the gripping-under device (13) is seated on an actuating 

shaft (8), which is rotatably mounted on the bracket (5) and is 
coupled to a connecting rod (6) by way of a gear train (7), and 

in that the connecting rod (6) is articulated on an actuating 
lever (16).  

 
Robot arm according to Claim 10, characterised in that the 
actuating lever (16) has at its free end a roller (20), by way 

of which it is actuated by the pushing device (33), displaceable 
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the robot arm (18), and 

consequently also the gripping-under device (13) is movable from 
the rest position to the working position, in which the roller 

(20) rests on the base plate (1). 
Robot arm according to either of Claims 10 and 11, 
characterised in that the gear train has a gear wheel (34) which 

meshes with a second gear wheel (35) seated on the actuating 
shaft (8) and is connected to the connecting rod (6). 
Robot arm according to one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised 
in that the gripping-under device (13) is a rectangular plate.
