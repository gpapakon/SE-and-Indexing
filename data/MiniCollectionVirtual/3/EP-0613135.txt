<ABSTRACT>
An optical disc system uses a recordable MD (mini disc) which can be applied to a 
multi-media system mass storage, such as a CD-ROM. In an optical disc system in 

which data of n sectors and added data of m sectors are error-corrected in a CIRC 
(Cross Interleave Reed-Solomon code) fashion ad error-corrected data is recorded on 

an MD (16) at the unit of 

l + n + m 
 
 sectors (l is the number of link sectors), when 

data is recorded and (or) reproduced, a rotational speed of the MD (16) is selected to be 
( 


l + m + n 
 
) times at least. When n is 32 sectors, m is 1 sector, the rotational speed is 

9/8 times and a maximum data transfer rate is selected to he 150 kB/s, data in a CD-ROM 
(10) can he recorded on the MD (16) at substantially the same transfer rate as the 

maximum data transfer rate (150 kB/s) of the CD-ROM (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disc
system suitable for use with a so-called mini disc (hereinafter
referred to as an MD) system, for example.MD systems, such as a recording and reproducing
apparatus for an MD that had been described in a Confidential
Information Mini Disc System, Rainbow Book, Tentative System
Description, published by Sony Corporation, July 1991 are now
commercially available on the market.MDs that are now available on the market are generally
classified as, for example, an MD from which recorded music
can be reproduced only in use (hereinafter referred to as a premastered
MD when necessary) and an MD on which the user can
freely record desired information (hereinafter referred to as a
recordable MD when necessary).The recordable MD has a format such that one frame is
formed of 24 bytes and one sector is formed of 98 frames. In
this case, an interleaving length of a CIRC (Cross Interleave
Reed-Solomon Code) as an error correction code is 108 frames,
which is longer than one sector. Therefore, when data is
recorded on the recordable MD, 3 sectors between adjacent data
recording areas must be used as "so-called useless sectors".
The area of the "useless sector" area is called a link area. In
other words, if 108 frames were not prepared before and after 
data were recorded respectively, then the interleaving would not
be completed. For this reason, the link area of 3 sectors must
be provided between the adjacent data recording areas.If data is recorded on the recordable MD from any
position, then the link areas are scattered on many portions of
the recordable MD, thereby deteriorating a utilization factor of
the recordable MD. For this reason, data is recorded on the
recordable MD at the recording unit of a certain large data
amount. In the recordable MD, this recording unit is called a
cluster and one cluster is formed of 36 sectors. In one
cluster, the leading 3 sectors are assigned to sectors of the
above link area (leading 3 sectors will hereinafter be referred
to as link sectors), and the next 1 sector is assigned to sector
for sub data which is added data (this sector will hereinafter
be referred to as a sub data sector). Remaining 32 sectors are
assigned to data recording sectors.FIG. 1 shows a data format of about one cluster of the
recordable MD thus described. As shown in FIG. 1, 1 cluster
includes a link area having link sectors LS formed of 3 sectors,
a sub data sector SS formed of one sector and a data area formed
of data sectors DS formed of 32 sectors.In the

<CLAIMS>
An optical disc apparatus for recording or reproducing data on or from an
optical disc, comprising:


error correcting means (15) for error-correcting data of n sectors of user
data and added sub data of m sectors in a CIRC error correction fashion;

and
means (20) for recording or reproducing the data error-corrected in a CIRC
error correction fashion on or from said optical disc in units of (I + n + m)

sectors, I representing a number of link sectors, v2 being the linear velocity
of the disc required when the disc being formatted at a predetermined

spatial frequency communicates with an audio input and
output equipment;
characterized by
the servo controller (22) of the disc drive being operated under the control
of a controller (26, 27) in a computer system so that the linear velocity is

(I + m + n)/n times said predetermined velocity v2.
The optical disc apparatus according to claim 1,
characterized by
a buffer memory (28) which communicates with the computer system in
which output data is written in response to a first clock and from which

stored data is read out in response to a second clock different from said
first clock.
The optical disc apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in
that said n is 32, said m is 1 and said I is 3.
A computer system comprising a first optical disc apparatus, a second
optical disc apparatus according to one of the preceding claims and a

computer connected to said first and second optical disc apparatus.
