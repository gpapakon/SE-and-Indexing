<ABSTRACT>
A spray bar (1) provided with nozzles (2) is intended 
for spraying an ink removing solvent on an inking roller in 

a printing press. The nozzles are shielded off from ink 
mist and other contaminants except when solvent is to be 

sprayed. Practically, a cover (3) provided with openings 
(4) corresponding to the nozzles on the spray bar is slidably 

arranged on the spray bar over the nozzles so as to be 
movable between a first position, in which the nozzles can 

spray through the openings, and a second position, in which 
the nozzles are covered.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for improving the 
function of a spray bar, intended for spraying a fluid on a 
roller in a printing press. The main object of the invention is to improve the 
function of a spray bar for spraying an ink removing solvent 
on an inking roller, but the teachings of the invention 
are equally applicable to other spray bars. A spray bar may be arranged adjacent to the uppermost 
roller or drum of an inking device or inking train in a 
printing press. Such an inking device comprises a number of 
rollers and/or drums for the purpose of conveying printing 
ink from a supply thereof to the printing cylinders, normally 
in a substantially vertical direction. Rather frequently the inking device has to be cleaned 
from ink, for example when a new colour is to be employed 
in the printing process. Such a cleaning may be performed 
in that ink removing solvent is sprayed on the uppermost 
roller or drum in the inking device by the spray bar provided 
with nozzles for that purpose. During this process the 
drums and rollers are rotated but are disconnected from the 
ink supply and the printing cylinders, and the ink removed 
by the solvent can be scraped off by cleaning blades and 
collected in trays. By this automated process the need for 
manual cleaning has been eliminated. As the spray bar is mounted adjacent a roller, which 
during the printing process rotates at a considerable speed 
with ink thereon, it is subjected to ink mist and contaminants, 
which may disturb the function of the nozzles, when 
they later shall spray the washing or ink removing solvent.  
 It is already known through US-A-3 897 726 to close drip nozzles 
in a printing press by means of seals. The object of the invention is to remove the drawback 
with clogged nozzles in the spray bar. This is according to the invention attained in that 
the nozzles of the spray bar are enclosed and protected from ink mist 
and other contaminants except when fluid is to be sprayed. A cover provided with openings 
corresponding to the nozzles on the spray bar is slidably 
arranged on the spray bar over the nozzles so as to be movable 
between a first position, in which the nozzles can 
spray through the openings, and a second position, in which 
the nozzles are covered. The cover may be connected to a 
pneumatic cylinder for its movement. The invention will be described in further detail below 
under reference to the accompanying drawings, in which 
Figs 1a and 1b in top views of a spray bar with a cover 
illustrate the
