<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the electrooxidation of methanol 
to formaldehyde and methylal. Formaldehyde is an important starting material for the production of 
certain polyacetal resins. It can be produced by the partial oxidation of 
methanol with air or oxygen in the presence of a variety of catalysts and under a 
variety of conditions. In some cases, methanol and formaldehyde formed in the 
process react further to give methylal, CH₂(OCH₃)₂ ; furthermore, formaldehyde 
often is in the same process oxidized in part to formic acid, which may again react 
with methanol to give methyl formate. Formation of methylal is not considered 
to be particularly detrimental to the production of formaldehyde because 
methylal can be readily hydrolyzed back to methanol and formaldehyde, as is well 
known in general for acetals and ketals. This catalytic process, in its various 
forms, is currently used to produce formaldehyde commercially. Nevertheless, it 
has the drawback of producing one mole of water for each mole of formaldehyde 
formed. This requires a rather complex and costly procedure for removing water 
from the formaldehyde produced. In addition, residual formaldehyde still 
present in the waste water must be removed before this water can be safely 
discharged. Electrochemical oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde in a fuel cell 
arrangement is described in U.S. Patent 4,457,809 (to Meshbesher). Simultaneous electrochemical reduction of a mixture of benzene and 
methanol in the presence of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate to phenol in the 
cathode compartment and oxidation to methylal in the anode compartment in a 
cell equipped with an ionic transfer membrane is reported in U.S. Patent 
4,732,655 (to Morduchowitz et al.). Electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol to methyl formate and methylal 
on a platinized solid polymer electrolyte membrane was reported by Otsuka et al. 
in Applied Catalysis, 26 (1986) 401-404. The authors describe a process that 
occurs without either a solvent or a liquid electrolyte. It is desirable to be able to produce formaldehyde and/or methylal in 
a selective manner and in an industrially satisfactory yield in a process that 
requires or produces a smaller amount of water than is produced in the 
conventional catalytic oxidation processes.  
 According to the present invention, there is now provided a process for 
the electrooxidation of methanol to a mixture of products comprising as the

<CLAIMS>
Process for the electrooxidation of methanol to a mixture of 
products comprising as the largest component a mixture of formaldehyde and 

methylal in a ratio that can be optimized with respect to either one, together with 
small amounts of methyl formate and any other products of oxidation or of side 

reactions, said process comprising: 

(1) providing an electrolysis apparatus comprising a hydrated 
membrane made of a fluorocarbon resin having pendant sulfonic acid groups but 

no pendant carboxylic acid groups, said membrane having a platinum layer 
attached to at least one side thereof by impregnation of the membrane with a 

cationic salt of platinum and reduction with an anionic reducing agent, and being 
placed in the apparatus so as to divide the apparatus into two compartments, said 

platinum layer serving as the anode and the compartment which the anode is 
facing being the anode compartment, the opposite side of the membrane facing 

the cathode compartment, the cathode being a metal layer on the opposite side 
of the membrane when such layer is present but otherwise being a separate metal 

cathode located in the cathode compartment;
 
   when a metal layer on the side of the membrane facing the cathode 

compartment is not present, and the separate metal electrode is not in direct 
contact with the membrane, the membrane being maintained wet with an 

electrolyte selected from the group consisting of aqueous solutions of at least 1 M 
sulfuric acid and of at least about 85 weight percent phosphoric acid, said 

electrolyte also being in contact with the separate cathode; 
(2) introducing a gaseous stream of methanol vapor plus any diluent 
gas continuously into the anode compartment at a pressure of about 101.3 - 1013 

kPa and, when formaldehyde is the desired main product, at a temperature of 
about 75-125°C, the mole fraction of methanol in the gaseous stream being about 

0.005-0.02, and, when methylal is the desired main product, at a temperature of 
25-125°C, the mole fraction of methanol in the gaseous stream being about 0.02 - 

1, while applying to the electrodes a voltage of about 0.6-1.2 V relative to a 
reference hydrogen electrode; and 
(3) recovering from the anode compartment the desired product 
mixture. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the membrane carries a metal layer 
on each side, the metallized surface of the membrane opposite the side carrying a 

platinum coating applied by the impregnation and reduction method being the 
cathode. 
The process of Claim 2 wherein the cathode metal is platinum, 
rhodium, or nickel.  

 
The process of Claim 3 wherein the membrane is saturated with 
liquid acid electrolyte. 
The process of Claim 4 wherein the electrolyte is concentrated 
phosphoric acid. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the electrolyte, when used, is about 
85 weight percent phosphoric acid; and the voltage applied between the anode 

and the cathode is 0.9-1.1 V relative to hydrogen reference electrode. 
The process of Claim 1, run at atmospheric pressure, wherein the 
partial pressure of methanol feed is about 507-2026 Pa, and the voltage applied 

between the anode and the cathode is 0.9-1.1 V relative to hydrogen reference 
electrode, whereby the principal electrooxidation product is formaldehyde. 
The process of Claim 7 wherein the partial pressure of methanol 
feed is about 1.3-2 kPa. 
The process of Claim 1, run at atmospheric pressure and at a 
temperature of 75-125°C, wherein the partial pressure of methanol feed is about 

10.13-81.04 kPa, and the voltage applied between the anode and the cathode is 
0.9-1.1 V relative to hydrogen reference electrode, whereby the principal 

electrooxidation product is methylal.
