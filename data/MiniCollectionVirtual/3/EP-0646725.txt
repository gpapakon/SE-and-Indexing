<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention is solids-handling pumps. Here, the invention deals with the delivery plunger (5, 6, 6a, 8), which is arranged detachably (9) on the front end of a plunger rod (10) axially displaceable via hydraulic drive. An annular plunger body (5) is mounted on a basic plunger body (6, 6a) via elastic compensating elements (3a, 3b, 7a, 7b) in such a way that axial inclined positions and parallel displacements of the plunger rod (10) are permitted without impairing the peripheral sealing actions (2) of the plunger.

A solid-matter or thick-matter pump (30) comprising an axial piston guide
and a piston rod (10) which bears an annular piston body (5) at its front end,


characterised in that
 the inner annular surface (5a) of the piston body (5) is
resiliently mounted (7; 7a, 7b) relative to the piston rod (10) of the pump (30).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to claim 1, wherein a seal (2)
towards the piston-body guide sleeve (20) is also resiliently mounted (3; 3a, 3b),

but on the outer annular surface (5b) of the annular piston body (5).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the first and/or second resilient bearing (3, 7) is in the form of

axially spaced compensating members (7; 7a, 7b; 3; 3a, 3b).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to claim 3, wherein the axial
spacing between the compensating members (7) on the inner annular surface (5a)

is different from the spacing between the compensating members (3) on the outer
annular surface (5b), especially the axial spacing between the inner compensating

members (7a, 7b) is greater.
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the resilient bearing or the axially spaced-apart compensating

members (7; 3) are toroidal 0-rings (7a, 7b; 3a, 3b).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the piston body (5) is secured in the axial direction by two annular

retaining elements (6, 8).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to claim 6, wherein the disc
(6) remote from the front end of the piston rod (10) is integrally connected to an 

annular base member (6a) which is mounted on a corresponding seat (10a) at the
front end of the piston rod (10) and has a greater (outer) diameter than the piston

rod (10).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein
the first disc or the second disc (8) can be firmly pressed against the base member

(6a) of the mountable retaining member (6) by means of a nut (9) screwable on to
a thread (10b) on the end of the piston rod (10), in order to hold the piston body

(5) axially between the two discs (6, 8).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the resilient bearing or the compensating members (3a, 3b; 7a, 7b)

are disposed in annular grooves (7c, 7d; 3c, 3d), especially project by somewhat
less than half their cross-section from the corresponding grooves (7c, 7d) in the

case of the inner resilient bearing and are recessed relative to the outer annular
surface (5b) in the case of the outer resilient bearing.
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to claim 9, wherein an annular
seal (2) can be fitted on the outer compensating members (3a, 3b) so that it (2)

projects radially at least partly beyond the outer annular surface (5b) of the piston
body (5).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to claim 7, wherein the seat
(10a) at the front region of the piston rod (10) has a stepped reduction (10a) in

diameter, and the mountable base member (6a) has a similar stepped diameter
reduction (6b) in its front part, so as to be fitted in close-fitting manner on the

piston rod (10), starting from the end region, and so as to be secured with an
exact fit and substantially horizontally by means of the nut (9) or the additional

disc (8).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to claims 6 to 11, wherein 
the radial dimension of the disc or discs (6, 8) is somewhat less than the radial

dimension of the outer annular surface (5b) of the annular piston body (5).
A solid-matter or thick-matter pump according to any one of claims 1 to 12,
wherein the piston body (5) is mounted in floating manner between a seal (2) and

the piston rod (10).
