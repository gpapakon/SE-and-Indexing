<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical signal analyzer and particularly to an analyzer for use 
in the monitoring and processing of medical signals representing selected physiological 
parameters, and as an aid to interpretation of the signals. In a modern hospital environment, many medical instruments are available to sense and 
display selected physiological parameters of a patient under observation, with information 
frequently being plotted or displayed as a time-varying waveform. Such an instrument 
may additionally incorporate an alarm system which operates by crudely comparing a 
feature of the waveform against a preset threshold, an alarm being raised when the 
particular measured feature crosses the threshold. Such a prior system is prone to positive 
and negative false alarms; that is, raising an alarm when the patient is in no immediate 
danger and not raising an alarm when the patient is in danger, respectively. The false 
alarm rate can be sufficiently high that in practice, the alarm is frequently ignored or even 
disabled. The analysis of the patient's condition using a medical instrument thus relies 
largely on the human interpretation of a continuous waveform. Correct interpretation 
requires specialised training, considerable experience, skill and alertness. Since it is 
frequently not possible to make personnel with such experience and training available on 
the ward on a 24 hour basis, the usefulness of the instrument is diminished. The paper "Development of an Advisor System for Foetal Diagnosis during Labour" 
(Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in 
Medicine and Biology Society, vol 10, US pages 1355-1357 A. Alonso et al) briefly 
describes work in the field of applying artificial intelligence to foetal diagnosis during 
labour. The paper describes the problems in the field but provides no technical 
information about any solutions. The paper "Foetos: an expert system for Foetal Assessment" (IEEE Transactions on 
Biomedical Engineering, vol. 38, no.2 Feb. 1991, pages 199-211, A. Alonso et al) 
provides a speculative outline of the application of artificial intelligence to foetal  
 
assessment in slightly greater detail than in the above paper. A rule based approach is 
used and the signals from a CTG are pre-processed according to the definitions given in 
the appendix on page 210. Insufficient detail is provided to produce a working system 
and the paper is concerned largely with the supervision of a foetus outside labour. It is an object of
