<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part patent application of 
co-pending patent application Serial Number 937,324 filed 
August 31, 1992 which is a continuation-in-part patent 
application of patent application Serial No. 822,478 filed 
January 17, 1992. This invention relates to an improved drive mechanism 
for surgical instruments. More specifically, this 
invention relates to an improved drive mechanism for 
endoscopic instruments which reduces the amount of force 
which a surgeon must apply or use during a surgical 
procedure and in certain embodiments improves the access 
of the instrument within the surgical environment. Endoscopic surgery has been gaining wide acceptance 
as an improved and cost effective technique for conducting 
certain surgical procedures. In endoscopic surgery, a 
trocar which is a pointed piercing device, is sent into 
the body with a cannula placed around the trocar. After 
the trocar accomplishes piercing of the abdominal walls, 
it is removed and the cannula remains in the body. 
Through this cannula, endoscopic procedures are possible. 
Often, multiple openings are produced in the body with a 
trocar so that an endoscopic instrument may be placed in 
one cannula, appropriate viewing mechanisms placed in 
another cannula and fiber optics for illuminating the 
surgical field placed in yet another cannula. Generally,  
 
these endoscopic procedures take place under insufflation. 
As more is learned about endoscopic surgical procedures 
and more instruments developed, the type of procedures 
that may be performed endoscopically will increase. 
Presently, typical procedures are gall bladder removal, 
tissue repair, hernia repair and the like. While endoscopic surgical procedures have substantial 
benefits to the patient, they do present certain problems 
to the surgeon conducting the procedure. For example, 
because the active part of the instrument is further 
removed from the manipulative part of the instrument, any 
slight movement of the manipulative part is magnified when 
it reaches the active part. Hence, when placing and 
forming a staple in tissue, the hand of the surgeon must 
be a lot steadier during the endoscopic procedure than if 
that same procedure was done during standard open surgery. 
The same can be said when severing vessels or incising 
tissue. Hence, in designing endoscopic surgical 
instruments, considerable effort is made to reduce the 
force required in order to operate or manipulate the 
instrument and allow the surgeon to have greater control 
over the

<CLAIMS>
An instrument for applying fasteners to tissue 
during endoscopic surgery, said instrument comprising a 

handle portion for manipulation outside a body of a 
mammal, a business head for applying a fastener to tissue 

within the body of said mammal and a housing portion 
connecting said handle portion to said business head, said 

housing portion having a rotatable drive shaft disposed 
therein and extending from said handle portion to said 

business head, said drive shaft being torsionally stiff to 
generate sufficient force to drive a fastener through 

tissue and apply said fastener to the tissue, and means 
disposed in said business head for translating the 

rotational forces of the drive shaft into non-rotational 
forces for applying said fastener. 
An instrument according to Claim 1 wherein the 
means disposed in said business head for translating the 

rotational forces of the drive shaft translates said 
rotational forces into linear forces for applying said 

fastener. 
An instrument according to Claim 1 wherein the 
means disposed in said business head for translating the 

rotational forces of the drive shaft into non-rotational 
forces translates said rotational forces into 

reciprocating forces for applying said fastener. 
An instrument according to Claim 1 wherein the 
handle includes means for rotating said rotatable drive 

shaft. 
An instrument for applying fasteners to tissue 
 

during endoscopic surgery, said instrument comprising a 
handle portion for manipulation outside a body of a human, 

a business head for applying a fastener to tissue within 
the body of said human and a flexible housing portion 

connecting said handle portion to said business head, said 
flexible housing portion having a rotatable, axially 

flexible, torsionally stiff drive shaft disposed therein 
and extending from said handle portion to said business 

head to generate sufficient forces to drive a fastener 
through tissue and apply said fastener to the tissue. 
An instrument according to Claim 5 which includes 
means disposed in said flexible housing and extending 

substantially the entire length of said flexible housing 
for controlling the position of the flexible housing and 

business head with respect to said handle portion. 
An instrument for applying fasteners to tissue 
during endoscopic surgery, said instrument comprising a 

handle portion for manipulation outside the body of a 
human, a business head for applying a fastener to tissue 

within the body of said human and a flexible housing 
portion connecting said handle portion to said business 

head, said flexible housing portion having an axially 
flexible, torsionally stiff rotatable drive shaft disposed 

therein and extending from said handle portion to said 
business head to apply sufficient force to said business 

head to apply a fastener to tissue, means disposed in said 
flexible housing for controlling the position of said 

business head with respect to said handle portion and 
means disposed in said business head for translating the 

rotational forces of the drive shaft into non-rotational 
forces for applying said fastener. 
An instrument according to Claim 7 wherein the 
means disposed in said business head for translat
ing the 
rotational forces of the drive shaft translates said 

rotational forces into linear forces for applying said 
fastener. 
An instrument according to Claim 7 wherein the 
means disposed in said business head for translating the 

rotation forces of the drive shaft translates said 
rotational forces into reciprocating forces for applying 

said fastener. 
An instrument according to Claim 7 wherein the 
handle includes means for rotating said drive shaft.
