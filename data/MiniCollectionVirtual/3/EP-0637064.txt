<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for high-flatness etching 
a semiconductor single crystal wafer wherein said wafer 

is so rotated in a flow of an ethchant radially 
spreading in a plane that the main surface of said 

wafer may move parallelly with the flow of said etchant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for etching uniformly the surface of a semiconductor 
single crystal wafer (hereinafter referred to simply as 
"wafer") obtained by slicing a semiconductor single 
crystal rod such as silicon and then lapping the 
opposite surfaces of each wafer resulting from the 
slicing to impart to the wafer an etched surface of 
high flatness. The chemical etching of wafer is utilized for the 
purpose of (1) removing from the surface of a wafer a 
deformed layer produced by such machining works as 
slicing and lapping, (2) allowing visual observation 
of crystal defect, and (3) microprocessing a wafer by 
selective etching, for example. The present invention 
is aimed to accomplish the purpose of (1) mentioned 
above. The conventional method used for etching of wafer 
consists in etching a given wafer by rotating the wafer 
in the flow of etchant caused as by bubbling and 
enabling the etchant in motion to come into contact 
with the surface of the wafer. In this case, the 
rotation of the wafer is intended to flatten the wafer 
surface as much as possible by abating the possibility  
 
that the reaction gas arising during the etching 
treatment will impart streaks or random undulation to 
the wafer surface. Incidentally, in the etching treatment, the 
desirability of decreasing the inconstancy of etching 
depth at various parts of the wafer or improvement the 
flatness of wafer surface is never fulfilled unless the 
relative average flow rate of the etchant and the wafer 
with which the etchant contacts is uniformized as much 
as possible at various parts of the wafer. The conventional method mentioned above, however, 
it is difficult to control the flow rate of the etchant, 
so it fails to uniform the etching depth of the wafer 
surface and to obtain a chemically etched wafer 
having high flatness. In the etching treatment, the etchant first 
contacts on the outer edge part of the wafer and then 
flows parallelly with the main surface of the wafer to 
the central part of the wafer. The relative average 
flow rate of the etchant and the wafer is locally 
varied in the outer edge part mentioned above. As a 
result, the etching treatment tends to become 
incomplete particularly in the edge part. Fig. 9 is 
intended to depict the state of incomplete etching. When the etchant flows in the direction of the 
arrow B while the wafer W is kept rotating or not 
rotating as shown in the upper part of Fig. 9, the  
 
flow rate varies at the edge part as mentioned above 
and
