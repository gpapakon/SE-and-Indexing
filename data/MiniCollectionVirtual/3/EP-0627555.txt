<ABSTRACT>
A device for pumping liquids, particularly in heat pumps, 
comprising a diaphragm pump (10) operated by a hydraulic circuit 

formed of a oil tank (17), a rotary pump (18) located between 
the tank (17) and the lower room (15) of the diaphragm pump (10), and a 

rotary distributor (19) having the function of delivering and 
sucking said oil in reciprocating motion to said diaphragm 

pump (10) so as to cause a reciprocating suction and delivery 
of the liquid to be pumped flowing to the upper room (13) of 

the diaphragm pump (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for the displacement 
of liquids and particularly a device for pumping 
liquids provided with a diaphragm pump which is reciprocated 
by a hydraulic circuit operatively connected to a 
rotary positive-displacement pump. In some thermodynamic apparatus such as, for example, absorption 
heat pump, in particular water-ammonia heat pump, 
the most critical component is the pump of the near-saturated 
solution which must have requirements of reliability, 
high head, capability of operating with a near-saturated 
liquid, and capability of operating under "dry" 
conditions, i.e. without liquid to be pumped. 
At the present state of art several pumping devices for 
satisfying the requirements listed above are known; in any 
case, however, there are a lot of drawbacks due to several 
problems such as the extreme mechanical complexity with 
the result of high cost, the insufficient reliability, the 
poor capacity to the "dry" operation, and the high overall 
dimensions. The invention seeks to provide a device of the type mentioned 
above having all of above requirements and being of 
reliable operation ad easy construction. In the USA patent No. 3,357,203 (Briggs) there is disclosed 
a pump operating under water-ammonia cooling cycles 
and generally comprising a diaphragm hydraulically 
operated with pressurized oil, two check valves for suction  
 
and delivery, respectively, and a cylindrical tank 
for stocking cooling liquid for starting. 
A very similar pump has been used by ARKLA Company producing 
refrigerating absorption machines. In such case, a hydraulically 
operated diaphragm pump is connected to a hydraulic 
circuit operated by a rotary pump in order to take 
advantage in the same machine of the operation of a diaphragm 
pump and a rotary pump which are, as known, 
cheaper, strong and reliable in the operation of a piston-connecting-rod-crank 
system used in the conventional diaphragm 
pumps. 
In a diaphragm pump the pumping operation is executed by a 
strong diaphragm which divides the head of the pump in two 
sections, the chamber for the liquid with its suction and 
delivery valves and the chamber for the oil, so that the 
outer motor does not pump directly the liquid but an intermediate 
hydraulic fluid with the advantage of a sealed 
circuit for the liquid. In the pump employed by ARKLA the 
device coupling the rotating system having unidirectional 
flow with the diaphragm pump having reciprocating flow is 
formed of a rotary distributor operating only in

A pumping device, of the type comprising a 
reciprocating diaphragm pump casing (10) and a rotary pump 

(18) connected to said diaphragm pump casing trough a 
distributor (19) cyclically inverting the suction and 

delivery strokes so as to transmit said reciprocating motion 
to the diaphragm (14), characterized in that said 

rotary distributor (19) consists of two metal disks 
(19,28) for the automatic shim adjustment of the wear 

clearance hydraulically provided by the delivery pressure 
of the rotary pump. 
Pumping device, of the type comprising a reciprocating 
diaphragm pump casing (10), a rotary pump (18) and a 

rotary distributor (19) that transmits said reciprocating 
motion, said diaphragm pump (10) being operated by a 

hydraulic circuit formed of an oil stock tank (17), said 
rotary pump (18) being located between the tank (17) and 

the lower room (15) of the diaphragm pump casing (10), and 
said rotary distributor having the function of delivering 

and sucking said oil in reciprocating motion to said 
diaphragm pump casing (10) so as to cause a pulsing 

delivery and suction motion of the liquid to be pumped 
flowing to the upper room (13) of said diaphragm pump 

casing, said rotary distributor (19) consisting of two 
metal disks (19,28) for the automatic shim adjustment of 

the wear clearance hydraulically provided by the delivery 
pressure of the rotary pump. 
Pumping device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the suction stroke of the liquid to be pumped is  

 
assisted by the rotary pump (18), thus allowing liquids 

having a lower suction pressure than the atmospheric 
pressure to be pumped. 
Pumping device according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said rotary distributor (19) is 

operated through a gear reduction unit (22) by the same 
drive stem (27) of the rotary positive-displacement pump 

(18).

Pumping device according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said rotary distributor (19) 

comprises a pair of symmetrical rooms (20,21) located 
along opposite circle sectors which alternatively cause 

the delivery of the oil to the diaphragm pump casing and 
the flow of the oil from the pump back to the tank. 
Pumping device according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that all of the rotary components are 

driven by only one motor (M) located outside said tank 
(17).
