<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nonpeptidyl inhibitors of integrin receptors. 
Specifically, the invention is directed to antagonists of the final common pathway of platelet 
aggregation. These antagonists act as potent antithrombotics. The invention further relates to 
therapeutic applications of these nonpeptidyl inhibitors in diseases for which blocking platelet 
aggregation is indicated. Platelets are particles found in whole blood that initiate and provide the structural 
basis for the hemostatic plug necessary to stop bleeding. Platelets depend on adhesive 
interactions with extracellular proteins and other cells for proper function (see Hawiger, J. 
Atherosclerosis Reviews 21:165-186 (1990) and Roth J. R. Immunology Today 13(2):100-105 (1992)). 
The external platelet plasma membrane surface is covered with a variety of membrane bound 
glycoproteins, many of which have recognition and adhesive functions. Perhaps the most 
abundant platelet membrane adhesive proteins belong to the integrin superfamily which 
include the glycoproteins; GPIIbIIIa, GPIaIIa, GPIcIIa, GPlblX, and the fibronectin and 
vitronectin receptors (Hynes, R. O., Cell, 48: 549 (1987). Each integrin receptor is an αβ 
heterodimer displaying characteristic affinity and specificity toward various protein ligands 
found in serum and /or the extracellular matrix including; von Willebrand factor (vWF), 
collagen, entactin, tenascin, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), and laminin, as well as fibrinogen 
(Fg) and thrombospondin (see Kieffer et al., Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 6:329-357(1990) and Ruoslahti, 
J. Clin. Invest., 87:1-5 (1991)). The most abundant integrin found on the surface of normal 
platelets is GPIIbIIIa comprising about 50,000 molecules per platelet and representing about 2% 
of the total platelet protein. GPIIbIIIa is a non-covalent, calcium ion dependent heterodimeric 
complex (Jennings, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257: 10458 (1982)) that is restricted in distribution to 
platelets and other cells of the megakaryocytic lineage (Kieffer et al., supra ). On activated 
platelets, GPIIbIIIa promiscuously binds a number of protein ligands with varying affinities, 
including; fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin and thrombospondin 
(Plow et al. , Biochemistry of Platelets, Phillips and Shuman eds., p. 225-256, Orlando: Academic 
Press [1986]). Each of these protein ligands contain at least one tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp 
(RGD) which is commonly referred to as the "recognition sequence". It is believed the
