<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a 
seal for a roller bearing, for instance a ball bearing. The 

seal according to the invention is formed from a thermoplastic 
polymer-containing material which is subsequently cross-linked 

under the influence of radiation, for example β-radiation. 
This allows the use of seals manufactured according to the 

invention at near or even above the melting point of the non-cross-linked 
thermoplastic polymer being employed. Due to the 

invention a large number of cheap polymeric materials have 
become suitable for the manufacture of seals, and due to the 

cross-linking the swelling caused by lubricants can be reduced 
considerably.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
a seal having a first part and a second, sealing part whereby a seal is formed from a thermoplastic 
polymer-containing material, said material subsequently being 
cross-linked under the influence of radiation, the irradiation of the first and second parts being 
different. Such a method is known from DE 2.654.931. This publication 
describes a method of cross-linking elastomeric compounds 
for seals for pneumatic or hydraulic purposes as well as seals 
for shafts. The object is to provide seals with reduced 
coefficient of friction while several other properties such as 
hardness can be modified as well. The present invention aims to provide a method of manufacturing 
polymer-containing seals for rolling element bearings. To this end the method according to the invention is 
characterized in that the seal is a seal for a rolling element bearing, 
the first part is cross-linked to a degree 
that it provides a form-retaining part, and the second part is cross-linked to a degree that it provides a sealing, elastic part.  
 As a result a seal can be manufactured in a simple and 
effective manner, formed from thermoplastic polymer-containing 
materials, whereby cross-linking under the influence of radiation 
adapts the properties of the material such that the seal 
is better suited for use near or above the melting point of the 
thermoplastic polymer. A seal formed from thermoplastic polymer-containing 
material cross-linked by radiation will during 
use in a rolling element bearing near or above the melting point of the 
original thermoplastic polymer retain its form and will only 
show mechanical wear. A preferred embodiment of the method uses ionizing radiation 
and in particular β-radiation. This is an effective manner to bring about cross-linking 
of the polymer material. Cross-linking the various parts of the pre-formed seal 
to a different degree can be advantageously carried out by 
adapting the radiation intensity and/or duration. By cross-linking the different parts of the pre-formed 
seal to a different degree their properties, such as  
 
rigidity, are adapted to the function of the particular part. 
When manufacturing a seal having a sealing, elastic part and a 
form-retaining part, cross-linking thus promotes good 
adherence between the respective parts. It is possible to manufacture the seal by means of 
injection moulding. This allows the seals according to the 
invention to be manufactured economically. In an advantageous
