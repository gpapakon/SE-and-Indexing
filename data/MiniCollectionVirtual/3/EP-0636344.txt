<ABSTRACT>
A medical instrument for treating sinusitis has a body 
(10), an insert tube (20) extending from a distal end of the 

body, and an angle portion (30) extending from a distal end of 
the insert tube. The angle portion is bent by a remote control 

member (40) mounted on the body, through a wire. A motor (50) 
is mounted on the body. The medical instrument also has a 

brush (60). This brush has an elongated rotation transmission 
portion (61) extending through the insert tube (20) and the 

angle tube (30), and a brush portion (65) attached to a distal 
end of the rotation transmission portion. A basal portion of 

the rotation transmission portion (61) is connected to the 
motor (50). The brush portion (65) is allowed to project from 

a distal end of the angle tube (30). At least that portion 
(64) of the rotation transmission portion (61) extending 

through the angle tube (30) is bendable. Therefore, when the 
motor (50) is rotated in the state that the angle portion (30) 

is bent, the brush portion (65) is rotated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical instrument for
treating inflammation of the paranasal sinus, i.e., sinusitis.Sinusitis, for example, maxillary sinusitis, is a
disease in which a mucous membrane on an inner surface of the
maxillary sinus is inflamed or peeled and finally suppurated to
produce pus. As one method for treating the maxillary sinus,
there is known a method, in which the peeled mucous membrane is
removed by an elongated spatula and drawn or sucked by a drawing
instrument or suction apparatus.In the case where the spatula is used, however, it is
difficult to insert the spatula deep into the curved maxillary
sinus and therefore, some of the peeled mucous membrane are
often left unremoved. Also, repetition of a reciprocal motion
of the spatula cannot assuredly remove the mucous membrane
which is peeled off over the entire inner periphery of the
maxillary sinus. Thus, the effect of treatment using the
spatula is not entirely satisfactory.A further method for treating sinusitis is known from document DE-U-8
806 758, which discloses a brush having a shaft portion for connection
to a rotational drive.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a medical instrument which is capable of remarkably
improving the effect of treatment of sinusitis. According to the present invention, there is provided
a medical instrument for treating sinusitis
comprising:
(a) a body (10); (b) an insert tube (20) extending from the body; (c) a bendable angle tube (30) extending from a distal end of
the insert tube; (d) a remote control member (40) mounted on the body
and adapted to remote control the bending of the angle tube
through a control
wire (45) extending through the insert tube and the angle tube; (e) a motor (50) mounted on the body; and(f) a brush (60) having an elongated rotation
transmission portion (61) whose rear end is connected to the
motor (50), and a brush portion (65) attached to a distal end of
the rotation transmission portion, the rotation transmission
portion being allowed to extend through the insert tube (20)
and the angle tube (30), at least that portion (64) of the
rotation transmission portion (61) corresponding to the angle
tube (30) being bendable, the brush portion (65) being allowed
to project outside from a distal end of the angle tube.Fig. 1 is a side view of a medical instrument for
treating sinusitis according to one embodiment of the present
invention; Fig. 2 is a side view, partly cutaway, showing an
important portion of the medical instrument on an enlarged

A medical instrument for treating sinusitis
comprising:


(a) a body (10);
(b) an insert tube (20) extending from said body;
(c) a bendable angle tube (30) extending from a distal end of
said insert tube;
(d) a remote control member (40) mounted on said body
and adapted to remote control the bending of said angle tube

through a control
wire (45) extending through said insert tube and said angle

tube;
(e) a motor (50) mounted on said body; and
(f) a brush (60) having an elongated rotation
transmission portion (61) whose rear end is connected to said

motor (50), and a brush portion (65) attached to a distal end of
said rotation transmission portion, said rotation transmission

portion being allowed to extend through said insert tube (20)
and said angle tube (30), at least that portion (64) of said

rotation transmission portion (61) corresponding to said angle
tube (30) being bendable, said brush portion (65) being allowed

to project outside from a distal end of said angle tube.
A medical instrument according to claim 1, in which
said rotation transmission portion (61) is provided on a basal

end side thereof with a hard portion (62) formed of a rod, said
hard portion being connected to said motor (50). 
A medical instrument according to claim 2, further
comprising connecting mechanism (80) for removably connecting

said hard portion (62) of said brush (60) to a rotating shaft
(82) of said motor (50).
A medical instrument according to claim 1, in which
said body (10) is provided with a switch control portion (15)

for starting rotation of said motor (50).
A medical instrument according to claim 1, further
comprising an arm (90) whose distal end portion is rotatably

mounted on said body (10) through a connecting mechanism (100;
200) such that rotational position of said arm is adjustable,

said remote control member (40) being rotatably mounted on a
rear end portion of said arm (90), said control wire (45) being

allowed to extend backwardly along said arm, a rear end portion
of said control wire being in association with said remote

control member.
A medical instrument according to claim 1, in which
said body (10) includes a grip portion (11) and an extension

portion (12) extending from one end of said grip portion in a
direction intersecting said grip portion, thereby forming a

gun-like configuration as a whole, said body being provided
with a trigger portion (15), said trigger portion being

provided as a switch control portion for starting rotation of
said motor (50), a distal end portion of an arm (90) being
