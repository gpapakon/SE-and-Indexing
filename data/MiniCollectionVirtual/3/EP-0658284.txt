<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric connection device with automatic positioning. The device is comprised of a first movable carriage (44) displaceable along the connection direction (C); a second carriage (48) mounted on the first carriage and movable with respect to the latter along a direction orthogonal to the connection direction (C); an indexing element (64) integral with the second carriage and extending along the connection direction, the first connection element (34) being integral with the second carriage; and a fixed cam-forming assembly (72) cooperating with the indexing element, the second connection element being integral with the cam assembly.
