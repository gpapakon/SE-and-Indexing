<ABSTRACT>
The control system for an injection valve of internal combustion engines for controlling the opening and closing movement of the nozzle needle (26) has an electromagnetically actuated directional control valve (37). This directional control valve (37) has a movable closure element (40) which is connected to the armature (104) of an electromagnet (38) and is guided in an insertion component (44) which is fixed to the housing. The closure element (40) is in one of two respective switched positions in which a valve space (72) is either connected via an inlet valve to a high-pressure fuel port (10) or via an outlet valve to a fuel return line (102). When the inlet valve is open, the fuel pressure in the valve space (72) acts via a control space (84) on the rear end of the nozzle needle (26) so that the latter is pressed against the seat of the nozzle needle and shuts off the injection holes. Since the directional control valve (37) only has one sliding surface (45) for guiding the closure element (40) the leakage losses of the injection valve are small.

Control system for an injection valve for
internal combustion engines for controlling the opening

and closing movement of the valve element of the injection
valve, having a directional control valve (37) which

can be switched by means of an electromagnet (38) and
whose closing element (40, 140), which can be moved

backwards and forwards in a translatory fashion, has a
first and a second closing face (56, 58, 156, 158) and,

depending on the switched position of the directional
control valve (37), either comes into contact, by means

of the first closing face (56, 156), with a first valve
seat (60) which is fixed to the housing and is arranged

on the side of an inflow line (16) for pressurized fuel,
or comes into contact, by means of the second closing

face (58, 158), with a second valve seat (62) which is
fixed to the housing and is arranged on the side of a

pressure relief line (92), and having a control space
(84) which, by means of the directional control valve

(37), can be connected either to the fuel inflow line
(16) via a passage which is defined by the first valve

seat (60) which is fixed to the housing, or can be
connected to the pressure relief line (92) via a passage

which is defined by the second valve seat (62) which is
fixed to the housing, the fuel pressure in the control

space (84) acting on the rear end of the valve element
(26) and pressing the latter against the valve seat (28)

of the injection valve, characterized in that the closing
element (40, 140), arranged at a distance from the

electromagnet (38), of the directional control valve (37) 
is guided by means of a single sliding face (45) in an

insert (44) which is fixed to the housing and is arranged
between the closing element (40, 140) and the electromagnet

(38), for which purpose the closing element (40,
140) is permanently connected to a guide element (42) on

the side of its first closing face (56, 156), said guide
element (42) being guided in the insert (44) and being

operatively connected to an armature (104) of the
electromagnet (38).
Control system according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the closing faces (56, 58) of the closing

element (40) are formed as outer faces of circular cones.
Control system according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the closing faces (156, 158) of the closing

element (140) are curved and are preferably formed as
spherical outer faces.
Control system according to one of Claims 1 - 3,
characterized in that the valve seats (60, 62) are formed

as edges.
Control system according to Claims 2 and 4,

characterized in that, in order to form the valve seats
(60, 62), circular conical faces (64, 66) are provided,

the angle of aperture of the circular cones defining the
circular conical faces (64, 66) differing by a few

degrees, preferably at most 3 degrees, from the angle of
aperture of the circular cones which define the

associated closing faces (56, 58).
Control system according to one of Claims 1 - 5,
characterized in that the first valve seat (60) and a

connection (80, 81) to the fuel inflow line (16) are
formed in the insert (44), and there is a second insert

(46) which is seated in the valve housing (18) and in
which the second valve seat (62) is formed, a valve space

(72) being formed between the inserts (44, 46).
Control system according to Claim 6, characterized
in that the valve space (72) is connected to the

control space (84) via at least one connecting
opening (82).
Control system according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that a spacer element (50) is arranged between

the inserts (44, 46).
Control system according to one of Claims 6 - 8,
characterized in that in the second insert (46) there is

an outflow connection (88, 90) which leads from the valve
space (72) to a return flow line (92).
