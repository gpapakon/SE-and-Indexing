<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an air data sensing probe (10) that has a cylindrical barrel (12) joined to a contoured strut section (16). The strut has leading (26) and trailing (32) edges formed along curved paths, and supports the cylindrical barrel (12) at a position spaced from a mounting surface (20) and facing upstream of relative air movement. The strut (16) has a rounded leading edge (26), and is generally ogival-shaped in cross section. There is a blended, relatively quickly-changing transition section (24, 40A) to blend the trailing end of the cylindrical barrel (12) into the ogival-shaped strut section (16) so that the probe (10) has reduced weight of the strut (16) and reduced drag, and through reduction of the cross-sectional area and rounding the strut leading edge (16), has enhanced anti-icing performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air data sensing probe that is
small in size to reduce weight while enhancing aerodynamic performance.Strut-mounted probes for air data sensors have been utilized for
years. There have also been probes which include curved tubes that have a
forward-facing port for sensing pitot pressure, and curve laterally to the side and
rearwardly to a mounting base or plate for mounting onto the side of a fuselage
of an air vehicle. Such probes or air data sensing devices protrude from a
surface of an air vehicle, and thus will undesirably increase drag when
compared with a similar vehicle without such protrusion. Since strut-mounted
probes are adjacent to the air vehicle surface, pressure disturbances caused by
the strut and adjacent surface need to be compensated in various ways. Strut-mounted
probes also have to be heated for de-icing during use. The mass of the
air data sensing device should also be minimized.Cylindrical barrel probes have been utilized for sensing pitot
and/or static pressure. Pitot pressure is sensed through a forwardly facing port,
while static pressure is sensed through an opening generally perpendicular to the
air flow. The strut on which the barrel is mounted generally has a streamlined
cross-section in fore and aft direction. Suitable strut thickness has to be
provided for de-icing heaters and also for carrying the pressure signal conduits
or tubes.It also has been known in the prior art to provide front and rear
edges of air data sensor struts that are shaped in compound curves to transition
from a forwardly-facing port to a side-mounting base for the air data sensor.WO86/07465 (Rosemount) and GB-A-857427 (Avimo) both
disclose a strut-mounted probe where the strut joins the
side surface of the barrel of the probe and supports the
barrel with its axis parallel to the aircraft surface. The
leading and trailing edges of the strut are straight up to
the region where they join the barrel. According to the present invention, there is provided
a pressure-sensing probe for mounting on an air vehicle
comprising:
a barrel having a generally cylindrical shape, a
central axis centered on a diameter of the outer
surface of the barrel, a length along the
central axis between forward and rear ends of the cylindrical barrel and a pressure sensing port;a mounting base;a strut extending between said mounting base and the
barrel and having leading and trailing edges
, the strut having
a generally ogival cross-sectional shape, and
the strut extending to support the
barrel
