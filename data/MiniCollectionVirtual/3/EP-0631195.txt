<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of toner compositions comprising: 

(i) preparing a pigment dispersion, which dispersion comprises a pigment, 
an ionic surfactant, and optionally a charge control agent; 
(ii) shearing the pigment dispersion with a latex or emulsion blend 
comprised of resin, a counterionic surfactant with a charge polarity of opposite sign to 

that of the ionic surfactant and a nonionic surfactant; 
(iii) heating the above sheared blend below about the glass transition 
temperature (Tg) of the resin, to form electrostatically bound toner size aggregates with a 

narrow particle size distribution; and 
(iv) heating the bound aggregates above about the Tg of the resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to toner processes, and more
specifically to aggregation and coalescence processes for the preparation of toner
compositions.In reprographic technologies, such as xerographic and ionographic devices,
toners with average volume diameter particle sizes of from about 9 microns to about 20
microns are effectively utilized. Moreover, in some xerographic technologies, such as the
high volume Xerox Corporation 5090 copier-duplicator, high resolution characteristics and
low image noise are highly desired, and can be attained utilizing the small sized toners of
the present invention with, for example, an average volume particle of from about 2 to
about 11 µm (microns) and preferably less than about 7 µm (microns), and with narrow geometric
size distribution (GSD) of from about 1.16 to about 1.3. Additionally, in some xerographic
systems wherein process color is utilized, such as pictorial color applications, small particle
size colored toners, preferably of from about 3 to about 9 µm (microns), are highly desired to
avoid paper curling. Paper curling is especially observed in pictorial or process color
applications wherein three to four layers of toners are transferred and fused onto paper.
During the fusing step, moisture is driven off from the paper due to the high fusing
temperatures of from about 130 to 160°C applied to the paper from the fuser. Where only
one layer of toner is present, such as in black or in highlight xerographic applications, the
amount of moisture driven off during fusing can be reabsorbed proportionally by paper
and the resulting print remains relatively flat with minimal curl. In pictorial color process
applications wherein three to four colored toner layers are present, a thicker toner plastic
level present after the fusing step can inhibit the paper from sufficiently absorbing the
moisture lost during the fusing step, and image paper curling results. These and other
disadvantages and problems are avoided or minimized with the toners and processes of
the present invention. It is preferable to use small toner particle sizes such as from about 1
to 7 µm (microns) and with higher pigment loading such as from about 5 to about 12 percent by
weight of toner, such that the mass of toner layers deposited onto paper is reduced to
obtain the same quality of image and resulting in a thinner plastic toner layer on paper
after fusing, thereby minimizing or avoiding paper curling. Toners prepared in accordance
with the present invention enable in
