18, 20, 21, 100) of a vertical reel-holding rod (3) on which 
the reels (4) are, or are about to be, stacked; the centering 

mechanism (8, 10-13, 17, 18, 20, 21, 100) comprises a vertical 
stem (13) on which a stack of reels to be moved is transferred 

so as to move it from a rod (3) to be unloaded to a rod (3) to 
be loaded, and a mechanism (24-29, 32, 35, 40) for removing and 

positioning the stack of reels that comprises an element (24) 
for removing the stack of reels (4) that is made to slide 

vertically to accomplish the removal or the positioning of the 
stack itself; the centering mechanism (8, 10-13, 17, 18, 20, 

21, 100) comprises sensor means (18, 20, 21, 100) suitable for 
detecting the vertical alignment of the stem (13) with the 

reel-holding rod (3) and to operate the activation of the 
removal and positioning mechanism (24-29, 32, 35, 40); the 

removal element of the removal and positioning mechanism 
(24-29, 32, 35, 40) is constituted by a pair of jaws (24) 

suitable for grasping a reel (4) at the base of the stack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic device for
loading and unloading stacks of reels of yarn, particularly for
loading and unloading material holders suitable for dyeing and
centrifuging.The process for the treatment of reels of yarn generally
provides for a step of dyeing the same; the dyed reels are
soaked, and they must subsequently be subjected to drying,
typically by means of centrifuges.Generally a drying centrifuge for reels of yarn comprises a
rotating basket on the bottom of which vertical rods are
fastened and arranged along concentric circumferences; each rod
acts as the central supporting axis of a stack of reels that
has been slipped over it. The reels to be centrifuged are
removed from a material holding carriage, or directly from a
basket immersed in the dyeing bath, where in a similar manner
they are stacked on vertical reel-holding rods, and are
transferred to the centrifuge.An automatic device is known for unloading drying
centrifuges that comprises a mechanism for centering the
reel-holding rod, comprising in turn a first stem to which the
stack of reels is transferred while it is being removed, and a 
mechanism for removing the stack of reels whose removal organ
is inserted under the reel at the base of the stack; the
removal organ, integral with a second vertically sliding stem,
is then raised together with the stack of reels, that is
transferred to the first stem and is inserted on the latter.
The same device can be used for loading the stack of reels,
here transferred from the first stem to the corresponding
holding rod of the centrifuge.A device of this type has two main drawbacks: the first
derives from the fact that, in order to allow the removal organ
to be inserted under the reel at the base of a stack, it is
necessary to provide suitable spacers at the base of each
reel-holding rod that keep the stack of reels raised by an
amount sufficient to allow the passage of the removal organ;
this implies that the baskets of the centrifuges, as well as
the various material holding carriages, be altered to adapt
themselves to the use of the automatic loading and unloading
device. The second drawback is linked with the centering
mechanism that, not being provided with an automatic device for
checking that centering has actually taken place, can cause the
incorrect positioning of the stem on which the reels are
transferred at removal, typically a slight misalignment of the
stem with respect to the reel-holding rod that can cause damage
to the yarn product during the reel

Automatic device for loading and unloading stacks of
reels of yarn, comprising a centering mechanism (8, 10-13, 17,

18, 20, 21, 100) of a vertical reel-holding rod (3) on which
the reels (4) are, or are about to be, stacked, said centering

mechanism (8, 10-13, 17, 18, 20, 21, 100) comprising a vertical
stem (13) on which a stack of reels (4) to be moved is

transferred for loading and unloading movement,
and a mechanism (24-29, 32, 35, 40) for

loading and unloading the stack of reels (4) that comprises
an element (24) for grasping the stack of reels (4) that is

made to slide vertically to
load and unload the stack itself, characterized in that said

centering mechanism (8, 10-13, 17, 18, 20, 21, 100) comprises
sensor means (18, 20, 21, 100) for checking whether the

centering of said stem (13) and said reel-holding rod
(3) has taken place and, in the affirmative for actuating the loading and

unloading mechanism (24-29, 32, 35, 40), and said grasping
element of the loading and unloading mechanism (24-29, 32,

35, 40) is constituted by a pair of jaws (24) suitable for latually
grasping a base reel of the stack.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said
stem (13) is vertically slidable, is hollow and has a diameter

suitable for receiving inside it an upper end (5) of said
reel-holding rod (3), there being provided motor means (17) to 

execute the vertical sliding action of said stem (13).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that said
sensor means (18, 20, 21, 100) comprise a rod (18) inserted in

said stem (13) and axially sliding with respect to the same
stem (13) under the thrust of the upper end (5) of the

reel-holding rod (3) when the latter, as a result of the
downward stroke of the stem (13), penetrates inside the same

stem (13), there being also provided sensor means (21, 100)
suitable for detecting the position of the rod (18).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said
centering mechanism (8, 10-13, 17, 18, 20, 21, 100) comprises a

clamp (8) having a pair of cheeks (7) that are previously
clamped over said upper end (5) of the reel-holding rod (3),

said jaws defining at the upper end a conical guide suitable
for facilitating the centering of the stem (13) over the

reel-holding rod (3).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said
jaws (24) are fastened to two respective rotatable coaxial

shafts (25), whose rotation to allow the opening or closing of
the jaws (24) is controlled by an oleodynamic cylinder (28, 29)

and by two connecting rods (27).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that said
coaxial shafts (25) are mounted on a saddle (32) sliding, under
