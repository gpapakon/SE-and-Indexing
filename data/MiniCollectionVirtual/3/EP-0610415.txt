<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device for temperature measurement 
and control in industrial plants, in particular 
where use of programmable logic devices (known as PLC) 
is anticipated. Many devices are known for measuring a temperature, 
comprising a probe or a transducer, adapted to provide 
as an output an electrical signal (usually an analog 
type signal) corresponding to the measured temperature 
value. These devices are associated with an amplifying 
unit and possibly with control and/or coding circuits in 
order to provide thermostatic transmitting or displaying 
devices (thermometers), or to be integrated in a more 
general control system. A drawback affecting all of these known devices is the 
fact that the components are available as individual 
components, usually manufactured by different companies. 
This causes a negative influence on the complete system 
performance. In fact, even though the single pieces have narrow 
manufacturing tolerances, the tolerance of the complete 
device comes out to be much larger (as a summation), and 
in any case there is left in addition an unavoidable sensitivity 
to drift problems (in time and operation) which 
cannot be evaluated, and therefore are impossible to be 
compensated, thus worsing the overall performance thereof.  
 GB-A-2183342 discloses a temperature measuring device 
consisting of two separate units comprising a transducer 
(thermocouple) and a logic microprocessor respectively, 
which are mutually connected through a free multi-way 
plug and socket fitting. The termocouple is individually 
calibrated by disconnecting it from microprocessor. The microprocessor stores in a buffer or displays in 
digital form or converts in analog form the data obtained 
from an EPROM forming part of the transducer unit. 
US-A-4743121 relates to an impermeable monolithic clinical 
electrothermometer, wherein the temperature-sensing 
element is connected to an electronic circuit powered 
by an internal (replaceable?) battery. US-A-4601589 describes an impermeable monolithic electrical 
pocket thermometer powered by a solar cell for 
measuring temperatures of liquids, snow, etc. 
GB-A-2128743 is concerned with a thermocouple for measuring 
surface temperatures, wherein the hot junction is 
attached to the surface whose temperature has to be 
measured, and is remotely connected to a detecting or 
reading device by a mineral insulated cable.  
 More particularly, in the conventional temperature 
monitoring systems the following error causes may be 
detected: 
1. drift
