<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of processing food.
In particular, the present invention relates to a method of processing food
by means of exposure to a selected band of infrared radiation which heats
an interior of the food without substantially browning the exterior surfaces.The term "processing" for purposes of this disclosure includes
all forms of cooking including: baking, thawing, proofing, deep heating, and
selectively thawing, for example.The use of infrared radiation to cook dough is known.
"Infrared Radiation" hereinafter referred to as IR radiation, for purposes of
this disclosure includes electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range
from 760 to 10,000 nanometers. The use of IR radiation to cook foods
offers several advantages over conventional baking.Devices which emit IR radiation do not heat the air in the
oven between the radiator and the product to be baked. Better process
control is possible by using IR radiation to cook food, as compared to
conventional baking.Baking times can be faster with short wave radiation as
compared to conventional baking. For products of less than a centimeter in
thickness, short wave radiation generally cooks foods faster than
conventional baking. A portion of the radiation in the IR wavelength range
penetrates the surface of the food to be cooked, and heats the interior of the
food. In contrast, with conventional cooking, the exterior surfaces of the
food are heated, and the remainder of the food is heated by means of
conduction from the exterior surfaces. Consequently, food baked by means 
of IR radiation typically reaches the selected final temperature faster than
baking in a conventional oven.It has been found that dough based products baked by means
of IR radiation have better textural qualities, have a thinner crust and a
finer crumb structure which are characteristics that are desirable to
consumers.It is known in the art that when making a determination as to
whether to use IR radiation to heat food, it is necessary to first determine
which wavelength band is most efficiently absorbed by food being heated.
The selection of the wavelength band depends upon the infrared
characteristics of the material being heated. For example, the deepest
heating beneath the surface for bread crumb and crust occurs with radiation
in a wavelength range between about 800 and about 1250 nanometers. A
penetration depth of 3.8 millimeters for crumb and 2.5 millimeters for crust
was measured at a wavelength band between 800 and 1,250 nanometers. C.
