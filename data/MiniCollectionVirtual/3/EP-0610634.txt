<ABSTRACT>
Device permitting the construction of floating floors (2) intended to provide active or passive filtering of vibrations. The invention relates to low-frequency resilient (elastic) spot-type supports consisting of helical-spring boxes (1). These spring boxes (1) are positioned at the time of casting the floor (2), the springs (5), which are prestressed beforehand, are used for raising the work by means of progressive release. The spring boxes (1) are accessible, demountable and adjustable for levelling the floor (2).

<CLAIMS>
Method of construction of a reinforced concrete floating floor
supported by the structural floor (3) in which empty spring units are

installed before pouring concrete (2); in these units are intalled
prestressed helicoidal spring (5) after drying of the floating slab.Then

the springs are released allowing the progressive lifting of the floating
slab from the structural floor, while doing elastic points with natural

vertical low frequency filtering vibrations.
Method as set forth in claim 1 : the units are accessible after putting the
floating floor into service, by opening a visiting cap (8) and each

support is removable and adjustable in height by screw (7).
Method as set forth in claim 2 : inspection, removal, and adjustment of
the spring units allows the adjustment in height and frequency, in case

of weight change and dynamic excitation change in the structure.
Method as set forth in any of the above claims : fixings (4) on the
spring units allow to join these to the reinforced concrete.
Method as set forth in any of the above claims : the helicoidal springs
and the inside of the units are corrosion protected against.
Method as set forth in any of the above claims : the helicoidal spring
units are closed by a cap (8) on the slab level.
