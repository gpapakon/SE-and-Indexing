<ABSTRACT>
In a relief valve, direction of action of operating 
fluid pressure on a valve body (38) is the same as 

direction of biasing of a spring (40) forcing the valve 
body (38) to a valve closing direction, and the relief 

valve includes means (14) for moving, when the pressure of 
the operating fluid exceeds a prescribed value, the valve 

body to a valve opening direction against the pressure of 
the fluid and against the force of the spring. Since the 

direction of action of the operating fluid is opposite to 
the direction of valve opening direction, a highly 

reliable relief valve can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a relief valve and, 
more particularly, to an improvement of a structure of a 
relief valve providing improved performance. A structure of a conventional relief valve will be 
described with reference to the figures. Fig. 4 is a cross section showing a structure of a 
conventional relief valve. Referring to Fig. 4, the relief valve has a housing 
52 serving as a body. Housing 52 is provided with an 
inlet port 54 through which operating fluid is introduced 
and an outlet port 55 through which operating fluid is 
discharged, at prescribed positions. In housing 52, there is formed a chamber 56 through 
which the operating fluid which has been introduced 
through inlet port 54 flows to outlet port 55. In chamber 56, a movable valve body 51 is forced 
against a valve sheet 58 by means of a pressure adjusting 
spring 53. Normally, when the fluid is not operating, movable 
valve body 51 is forced against valve sheet 58 by the  
 
force of pressure adjusting spring 53, and therefore the 
relief valve is closed. Referring to Fig. 5, when operating fluid is 
introduced with a prescribed pressure through inlet port 
54, movable valve body 51 moves in the direction of flow 
of the operating fluid against the force of pressure 
adjusting spring 53. Thus, the relief valve is opened. However, in the relief valve having the above 
described structure, the direction of movement of the 
movable valve body 51 opening the relief valve is the same 
as the direction of action of the operating fluid. Accordingly, in ordinary use, the force acting on 
movable body 51 by the operating fluid is always in the 
same direction as the opening direction of the movable 
valve body, so that the valve is not always closed as 
desired. Sometimes the valve is opened undesirably even 
when the pressure of the operating fluid is lower than the 
prescribed set value. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
relief valve of superior performance which can prevent 
leakage of operating fluid, by setting the direction of 
force applied by the operating fluid identical with the 
direction of closing of the valve.  The above described object is attained by a relief 
valve in accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention which opens when internal fluid exceeds a 
prescribed pressure, in which the direction of pressure of 
the operating fluid acting on the valve body is the same 
as the direction of biasing force of a spring forcing the 
valve body to a closing direction, and which includes 
means

<CLAIMS>
A relief valve which opens when pressure of inner 
fluid exceeds a prescribed pressure, wherein 

   direction of action of operating fluid pressure on a 
valve body (38) is the same as direction of biasing of a 

spring (40) forcing said valve body (38) to a valve 
closing direction, said relief valve comprising 

   means (14) for moving, when the pressure of said 
operating fluid exceeds the prescribed pressure, said 

valve body (38) to a valve opening direction against 
biasing force of said spring and against said pressure of 

the operating fluid. 
A relief valve, comprising; 
   a housing including therein a fluid passage (2, 4, 6) 

with an inlet port (44) and an outlet port (46); 
   a movable valve sheet (26, 36) placed in said fluid 

passage (2, 4, 6); 
   a movable valve body (38) placed in the fluid passage 

between said inlet port (44) and said movable valve sheet 
(26, 36) for opening and closing passage in cooperation 

with said movable valve sheet (26, 36); 
   first forcing means (42) for forcing said movable 

valve sheet (26, 36) to a valve closing direction;
 

   a second forcing means (40) for forcing said movable 
valve body (38) to a valve closing direction; and 

   valve opening means (14) for opening the valve, when 
pressure of fluid introduced through said inlet port (44) 

exceeds a prescribed value and said movable valve sheet 
(26, 36) moves against force of said first forcing means 

(42), by abutting said movable valve body (38) for 
separating said movable valve body (38) from said movable 

valve sheet (26, 36). 
The relief valve according to claim 2, wherein 
   said movable valve sheet (26, 36) includes a chamber 

(24) therein, a valve sheet (39) is provided at a position 
of the chamber (24) facing said fluid passage (2, 4, 6,) 

and said movable valve body (38) and said second forcing 
means (40) are contained in the chamber (24, 36). 
The relief valve according to claim 3, wherein 
   said valve opening means (14) includes a shaft (14) 

fixed at said housing (8) and extending in said movable 
valve sheet (26, 36).
