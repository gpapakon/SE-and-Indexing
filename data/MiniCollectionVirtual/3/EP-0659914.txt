<ABSTRACT>
In a method and a device for winding warped bands (19) in at least two sections, located next to one another, onto the drum (9) of a warping apparatus, a manipulator (16) is provided. At the end of the operation of winding a section, the threads of the warped band (19) are severed, both the band start (29) facing the thread-delivery arrangement (10, 11) and the band end (13) facing the drum (9) being connected by means of at least one sheet-like structure (18, 18a) extending transversely relative to the thread running direction and being fixed thereby.

A method of winding on warp sheets (19) which are fed by a yarn
feed arrangement (10, 11, 15) and which in at least two sections (8, 28)

arranged side-by-side are wound on to the drum (9) of a warping
installation (1), characterised in that at the end of the winding-on

operation of a section (8, 28) the yarns (5) of the warp sheet (19) are
severed and in that case joined both at the beginning (29) of the warp

sheet (19) that is towards the yarn feed arrangement (10, 11, 15) and also
at the end (13) of the warp sheet (19) that is towards the section winding

(8), by at least one flat portion (18, 18a) extending transversely with
respect to the yarn running direction, and in that case are fixed, and

that then the warp sheet beginning (29) that is towards the yarn feed
arrangement (10, 11) is fixed by means of the flat portion (18, 18a) to

the drum (9) in the next following section region or in the region of the
next successive winding (28).
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the yarns of
the warp sheet (19) are fixed by means of a flat portion (18, 18a)

approximately parallel to the drum (9) and that then the flat portion
(18a) together with the fixed yarns (5) is divided parallel to the drum

(9) into two parts.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the
yarns (5) are fixed from both sides of the warp sheet (19) by at least two

flat portions (18, 18a) which can be glued, secured by claw engagement or
welded.
A method according to one of preceding claims 1 to 3 characterised
in that the flat portion (18) is stuck on to the drum (9) with an adhesive

strip (24).
A method according to one of the preceding claims characterised in
that the warp sheet (19) is fixed by two flat portions (18, 18a) which are

disposed on the warp sheet (19) at the spacing of a winding periphery so
that in the winding-on operation the second of the flat portions (18, 18a) 

after a winding revolution lies on the first flat portion (18, 18a) and
can be fixed thereon, preferably by glueing.
A method according to one of the preceding claims characterised in
that the length of the flat portions (18, 18a) correspond to the width of

a section (8) and that the lateral spacing of the yarns (5) of the warp
sheet (19) is reduced prior to the joining operation with the flat portion

(18, 18a).
Apparatus for winding on warp sheets (19) which are fed by a yarn
feed arrangement (10, 11, 15) and which in at least two sections (8, 28)

arranged side-by-side are wound on to the drum (9) of a warping
installation (1), for carrying out the method according to claim 1,

characterised in that there is provided a device (17, 17a, 20, 20a, 22)
for applying at least one flat portion (18, 18a) to the warp sheet (19)

approximately transversely with respect to the yarn running direction,
that there is provided a severing device (25) for severing the yarns

and/or the flat portion (18) or the flat portions (18, 18a), the that
there is provided a manipulator (16, 26) for applying the warp sheet

beginning that is towards the yarn feed arrangement to the drum (9) by
means of the flat portion (18, 18a) in the next following section region

or in the region of the next successive winding (28).
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that the device
for applying the flat portion has at least one heat-producing device (20,

20a).
Apparatus according to claim 8 characterised in that the heat-producing
device (20, 20a) is designed to heat the flat portion (18, 18a)

to the plasticisation temperature thereof.
Apparatus according to one of claims 8 and 9 characterised in that
the heat-producing device (20, 20a) is arranged on the manipulator (16). 
Apparatus according to one of preceding claims 8 to 10
characterised in that a severing device (25) is provided on the

manipulator (16, 26).
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that the device
for fixing the yarns on flat portions has at least one adhesive strip feed

device.
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that the device
for fixing the yarns on flat portions has a sewing device.
