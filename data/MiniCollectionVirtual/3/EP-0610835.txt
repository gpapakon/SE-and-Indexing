<ABSTRACT>
Film encodement method and apparatus for optically 
encoding image frame format information on the film in 

a camera adapted to receive film having film metering 
perforations along one side of the film which are 

spaced apart by the length of film frame areas on the 
film. Data representing a desired frame format for the 

resultant photoprint is optically encoded on the film 
between the spaced apart perforations by the same 

perforation sensor LED, operative in the visible light 
spectral region, as is used to perform film metering in 

the camera.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of
photographic film cameras and more particularly to
cameras adapted for optical recording on the film strip
of indicia designating image frame format information.It is known to record indicia on film within
a camera at the time a picture is taken to
designate a desired image frame format for the
resultant photo print that differs from a standard
frame format. The use of pseudo format
reproduction is an example of such a print format
variation wherein the resultant print may be in a
pseudo telephoto or a pseudo panoramic format.A pseudo telephoto print ("pseudo tele") is
one that is made from a restricted central portion
of a film image frame that usually has the same
width-to-length aspect ratio, e.g. 1.0:1.5 (or
4"x6"), as that of the original full sized frame
on the film (for 35mm film). During the printing
process, the peripheral portions of the film image
frame are masked off and the central portion is
enlarged to the desired size to give a print with
an apparent telephoto or close-up format. The
degree of telephoto effect is determined by the
enlargement and masking employed at the printer.A pseudo panoramic print ("pseudo pan") is
one in which upper and lower portions of the film
image frame are masked off to provide a resultant 
viewing area in the print that has an elongated
width-to-length aspect ratio greater than 1:2 and
preferably 1:3. During the printing process, the
film image frame is masked as described and the image
is enlarged to provide a full height print with the
appearance of a panoramic or elongated format. Both
pseudo tele and pseudo pan prints are thus
accomplished by adjustment of the printer without the
need for the use of a true telephoto or wide angle
lens in the camera.It is also well known to provide encodements on film
to present an indication to the photofinisher that any
given image frame on a film strip is to be printed with a
particular pseudo format. Representative examples of
such teachings are found in commonly assigned U.S.
Patents 4,583,831, 4,652,104 and Re. 32,797. In such
disclosures, one or more dedicated light emitting diodes
(LED's) are provided to expose film margins or interframe
regions with encodement that, after processing of
the film, are readable at the printer to produce the
appropriate pseudo-format prints. It is also known, as
shown in French patent 2518769, to provide optical
exposure of characters on camera film by means of a light
emitting exposure device in which synchronization of the
character exposure
