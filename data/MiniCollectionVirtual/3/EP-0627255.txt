<ABSTRACT>
A method of selectively clogging failed hollow fibers (1,2) of a 
membrane 

module packed together with a plurality of non-failed fibers in a shell-and-bore 
arrangement comprises: 


(i) Holding the module vertically and bringing the module end 
into contact with a liquid sealant (9); 
(ii) Causing the liquid sealant (9) to rise into the failed fibers 
(1,2) to a height (10,11) greater than that of the failure; 
(iii) Allowing the sealant to solidify at least partially; 
(iv) Cutting off a length of the fiber bundle of such height (13) 
that 

non-failed fibers bores are exposed while failed fibers remain clogged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of hollow fiber membranes.
More particularly, the invention relates to a method of repairing hollow
fiber membrane modules by the selective clogging of fibers which have
failed during the manufacturing process.Membrane processes are material separation processes based upon the
passage of material through the membranes wall to allow the selective
separation of different materials.A membrane is a solid configured as a thin layer of large surface area.
Among other purposes, membranes serve as tools of separating two or
more material components out of a mixture. The separative properties of
membranes are based upon their different permeabilities to the various
material components. Thus, in order to effect a separation, a driving force
must exist across the membrane, which promotes the permeation of
material through it, which may be a pressure or a concentration
differential.For the case of pressure differential driving force, the membrane must
acquire the mechanical strength necessary to withstand the pressure
differential. This contradicts the requirement that the membrane must
be as thin as possible in order to allow large cross-flows. Therefore, the
membrane is supported on a relatively porous support which sustains the 
mechanical load on the one hand, and allows free cross-flow of material
through its large pore system on the other hand.The necessity to have thin membrane layers, large surface areas in a
given volume of a membrane separator, and a porous mechanical support
has brought about the development of the hollow fiber membranes. These
are thin tubes of circular cross-section. As such, they are self-supporting
and occupy a small volume per unit surface area. A hollow fiber
membrane module for separation is most frequently designed as a shell-and-tube
assembly, as shown in Fig. 1. In such an arrangement, separate
accesses to the interior (bore) and exterior (shell) sides of the HF
membrane are possible, so as to enable the separation of the three major
material flows: the feed, the reject which is collected at the opposite side
of the module but at the same membrane face at which the feed was
introduced, and the permeate which is the result of the flow through the
membrane.A bundle of hollow fiber (HF) membranes, when assembled in a shell-and-tube
configuration for separation purposes, may contain a few broken or
pinholed fibers. This is schematically illustrated by numeral 1 in Fig. 2,
where a broken fiber is shown. The material transfer through these

A method of selectively clogging failed hollow fibers (1, 2) of a membrane
module

packed together with a plurality of non-failed fibers in a shell-and-bore arrangement
(7, 8),

comprising the steps of:

i. Clogging all fiber bores at one end of the pack or bundle of
fibers;
ii. Substantially evacuating the module both at the shell (7) and at
the bore (8) side;
iii. Filling the bore (8) and the shell (7) sides with a non-permeant gas
iv. Holding the module vertically, disconnecting the bore side of
the module from the non-permeant gas supply and dipping the module

end opposite the clogged end into a reservoir containing a liquid sealant (9); 
v. Applying a reduced pressure to the shell side (7) for a period of
time sufficient to permit suction of sealant (10, 11) into the bores of failed fibers

through the failure of which vacuum is applied to the bore side (8);
vi. Allowing the sealant to solidify at least partially;
vii. Cutting off a length of the fiber bundle such that non-failed
fibers bores are exposed while failed fibers remain clogged;
viii. If necessary, repeating the above steps at the other end of
the module.
