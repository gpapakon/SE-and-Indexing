<ABSTRACT>
The problem with prior art automatic tensioning and damping components is that back-distortion energy is wasted between the moving chain strands. The origin of this problem lies in its chain-speed-synchronous rolling movement. The novel tensioning and damping component is designed to waste less energy. The problem is solved by an elastically deformable automatic tensioning and damping component (3), pretensioned between the load strand (1) and the loose strand (2), and fully or partially matched in form on its outer surface with the chain. The novel automatic tensioning and damping component is slidingly retained in the bend in the loose strand and its distance from the chain wheels is thus self-adjusting. The invention is applicable to mechanical engineering.

Automatic tensioner and damper for endless chain drives that is 
configured as an elastically deformable element situated between 

their slack runs and their tensioned runs and constantly acts 
simultaneously on both of said runs, characterized by the fact that 

said element has a roughly elliptically shaped deformable ring having 
a shape intermediate between that of a concentric annulus, or variations 

thereon created by radially deforming same, and a Cassini oval, where 
said deformable ring has a profiled guide on its inner surface matching the 

profiles of the chains of said drives while providing adequate running 
clearances, and where the outer diameter, or the minor axis, A1-A2, of 

said deformable ring exceeds the diameter of the largest sprocket of 
said drives. 
Automatic tensioner and damper for endless chain drives that is 
configured as an elastically deformable element situated between their 

slack runs and their tensioned runs and constantly acts simultaneously 
on both of said runs characterized by the fact that said element has a 

flexible curved member with a profiled guide on its inner surface matching 
the profiles of the chains of said drives while providing adequate running 

clearances and an integral, rigid or flexible, straight or curved, chain guide 
having a profiled guide on its inner surface, where the length, 1, of said 

chain guide exceeds said distance, B1-B2, and said chain guide is 
situated across from, and at a distance B1-B2 from, said curved member, 

and where said distance, B1-B2, exceeds the diameter of the largest 
sprocket of said drives.
