<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wholly aromatic
liquid crystalline polymer containing the residue of a
sulfonated ionic monomer unit in the polymer backbone. The
polymer exhibits enhanced adhesion properties and is useful
for forming laminate materials.Due to their availability and characteristics, wholly
aromatic liquid crystalline polymers are desirably used in
the formation of laminate articles. However, the use of
these polymers therefor has been hindered by their poor
adhesion properties to other laminate forming materials.
The adhesion of glass, ceramic, polymeric and metallic
layers to wholly aromatic liquid crystalline polymers has
required the application of binders, heat and compression
to the interfacial surfaces of the layers. US-A-4,599,395 discloses thermotropic fully-aromatic
polyesters which contain sulfonic acid and/or metal
sulfonate groups bound to the aromatic rings of the
polyester having improved mechanical properties.US-A-4,233,196 discloses water-dissipatable polymers
which are reaction products of at least one dicarboxylic
acid, at least one difunctional sulfomonomer containing at
least one metal sulfonate group and a glycol or a
glycol/diamine mixture.US-A-4,540,737 discloses wholly and non-wholly
aromatic polyesters forming thermotropic liquid crystal
polymers. It has now been discovered that the addition of a
small amount of a wholly aromatic ionic moiety to the
backbone of wholly aromatic liquid crystalline polymers
will improve the adhesion properties of the resulting
polymers. The ionic moiety useful in the present invention
is typically the residue of a wholly aromatic monomer
having a metallic sulfonate group pendent thereto. The
ionic moiety may be included in the backbone of wholly
aromatic polyesters, aliphatic-aromatic polyesters,
polycarbonates, poly(ester-carbonates), poly(ester-amides)
and polyaramides to provide polymers exhibiting enhanced
adhesion properties.In accordance with the present invention there is
described melt processable wholly aromatic liquid
crystalline polymers capable of forming anisotropic melt
phases at temperatures below approximately 400°C having
enhanced adhesion properties containing a small amount of
recurring moieties of a sulfonated, ionic moiety into the
backbone of the polymer. The wholly aromatic liquid crystalline polymers of the
present invention are useful for forming laminates which
may include layers of ceramics, glasses, metals, other
polymers and mixtures thereof. The invention finds
particular use in the formation of
