<ABSTRACT>
A valve of the type for controlling engine coolant flow to a heater core 
having a resilient butterfly valve formed of thermoplastic elastomeric material. 

The outer periphery is sufficiently resilient to absorb actuator overtravel in the 
seated condition. The butterfly has formed integrally therewith a central hub 

with torque-transmitting surfaces molded therein and a pair of oppositely 
disposed stiffeners extend outwardly from the hub in the central region of the 

butterfly. Assembly is simplified by placing the butterfly in the body and 
inserting a winged actuator shaft through journal holes in the body into the 

butterfly hub such that the wings on the shaft engage the torque-transmitting 
surfaces in the hub.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to valves of the type employing a pivoted 
butterfly type movable valve member. Valves of this type are typically 
employed in automotive applications for controlling flow of engine coolant to 
and from the passenger compartment heat exchanger or heater core. In such 
automotive heater core valve applications, it is known to provide a metal 
butterfly plate spot welded to a pivot shaft rotatably mounted through the 
walls of the valve housing for connection to an external actuator. Metal plate 
butterfly valves employed for automotive heater core applications typically are 
fabricated by inserting the valve plate in a mold and molding an elastomeric 
bead-rim thereabout for facilitating sealing of the periphery of the metal plate 
about the wall of the flow passage in the valve housing which is typically 
formed of die-cast metal or molded thermoplastic material. This method of 
construction by molding an elastomeric rim on a metal plate and then spot 
welding the plate to the actuator shaft in the valve housing has proven to be 
quite costly in the high volume mass production required for automotive 
heater valve applications. GB-A- 1525 853 discloses a valve assembly comprising: 
body means formed of rigid material defining a valving chamber 
with an inlet and outlet passage communicating with the 
chamber; 
a butterfly member disposed in said chamber and movable 
between a position opening and a position blocking fluid 
communication between said inlet and outlet, said member 
having a hollow hub interiorly defining torque transmitting 
surfaces 
said butterfly member being formed integrally of thermoplastic elastomer; and shaft means received through said hub and engaging said torque 
transmitting surfaces, said shaft means mounted for rotational 
movement on said housing means. The aforesaid butterfly valve construction 
has been prone to breakage 
in service where the actuator shaft experiences overtravel, after 
the butterfly valve has closed against the wall of the flow passage in the 
valve, particularly in servomotor powered valve applications. Thus it has been 
desired to find a way or means of constructing a butterfly valve which is 
capable of being mass produced in high volume, such as for automotive 
heater applications, at a low manufacturing cost, and which provides reliable 
service and will readily absorb some degree of actuator overtravel in service 
without breakage.  
  
 The present invention provides a butterfly valve of the type suitable for 
control
