<ABSTRACT>
A scanning head printer (44) includes a battery (74) that 
is onboard a reciprocating printhead (68) for providing power 

necessary for printing onto a medium, such as a sheet of 
paper. In a second embodiment, the drive signals for 

firing ink from the scanning printhead (68) are transmitted in 
a wireless fashion. If both the onboard battery (74) and the 

wireless transmission are combined, the scanning print-head (68) 
can be free of restrictive cables that link the 

printhead to stationary circuitry. Preferably, the 
printhead includes power-conditioning circuitry. A 

stationary primary coil may be employed for inductive 
coupling to a recharge coil that is mounted for movement 

with the printhead and the onboard battery (74), thereby permitting 
recharging of the battery when the printhead (68) is 

in a rest position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
printers having scanning printheads and more particularly
to providing power and drive signals to an inkjet print-head.A thermal inkjet printer includes a printhead
having an array of nozzles. Each inkjet nozzle comprises
a resistor patterned on a substrate using conventional
thin-film fabrication procedures. Ink is allowed to flow
into the resistor area, whereafter heating the resistor
causes the ink to essentially boil and a tiny droplet of
ink is "fired" from the nozzle. The printhead is mounted
on a cartridge having a supply of ink for replenishing
the nozzles as they are fired.A printer may have a full-width head or may
have a scanning head that is caused to move in a direction
perpendicular to a paper path in order to print
across the width of a sheet of paper. In inkjet technology,
a first level of connection from a scanning print-head
is made to a flex circuit. Referring to Figs. 1a
and 1b, an inkjet cartridge 10 is shown as including a
housing 12 for storing a reservoir of ink. A printhead
14 having nozzle openings 16 is mounted on one side of
the cartridge. Drive signals to heat the resistors of
the printhead are provided by traces 24 on a dielectric
material 22. Raised contact pads 23 are located at the
ends of the traces 24 opposite to the printhead. The
flex circuit that comprises the dielectric material 22,
the raised contact pads 23 and the traces 24 provides a
first level of interconnect from outside circuitry to the
resistors of the printhead 14. The second level of interconnect is from the
raised contact pads 23 to a flexible interconnect strip
having parallel interconnect lines that extend to stationary
logic circuitry of the printer. Referring now to
Fig. 2, a flexible interconnect strip 26 includes raised
bumps, not shown, that are in registration with the
raised contact pads on the dielectric material 22 on the
housing 12 of the inkjet cartridge. A snap-spring metal
member 28 is fixed to a molded-in carriage 30 by engagement
with a ledge member 32 on the cartridge. On the
side of the flexible interconnect strip 26 that is opposite
to the dielectric material 22 is a series of spring
pad bumps, not shown, that urge the raised contact areas
of the interconnect strip against the raised contact pads
of the flex circuit of the cartridge. These spring pad
bumps are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,907,018
to Pinkerpell et al., which is assigned to the assignee
of the present application. When the housing 12 is pivoted
to a vertical position

A scanning head printer comprising:

a stationary base (46) having a shaft (58,60);
a displaceable assembly (48), slidably engaging said
shaft, having a reciprocating head means (68) for printing

on a sheet of material, said reciprocating head means
including an array of inkjet nozzles (16) in fluid

communication with a supply of ink and operatively associated
with a plurality of resistors that heat sufficiently to cause

at least one drop of ink to eject from a nozzle; and
means (62), attached to said base (46), for moving said
displaceable assembly along a print path;

characterised in that the printer further comprises:

a battery mounted onto said displaceable assembly (48)
to maintain a fixed position relative therewith during

operation, said battery being electrically connected to
provide a source of current solely to heat said resistors in

response to print drive signals.

means (72) for wireless reception of said drive signals, said

receiving means being electrically connected to said
reciprocating head means (68) to selectively actuate said

reciprocating head means and being mechanically connected to
said reciprocating head means for movement along said print

path.

a receiver for optical reception of remotely generated drive

signals.
The printer of claim 3 wherein said receiver means
includes an infrared sensor.
The printer of any of claims 2 to 4 further comprising
a stationary transmitter for generating said drive signals 

for remote reception by said receiving means.
The printer of any preceding claim further comprising
a fixed means for recharging said battery when said

reciprocating head means is in a rest position.

includes a first coil and a source of alternating current

electrically connected to said first coil.
The printer of claim 7 further comprising a second coil
connected to said battery for movement therewith, said second

coil disposed to be within a magnetic field of said first
coil when said reciprocating head means is in said rest

position.
