<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method for the production of aliphatic 
copolyester films. The method comprises the steps of:

 
   applying esterification or ester-interchange at below 220°C to a 

reaction mixture of 

an acid component selected from the group consisting of succinic 
acid, succinic anhydride and succinic acid ester, 
1,4-butanediol as a diol component, 
2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol of 1 to 30% by mole based on the 
mole of the acid component, 
at least one multifunctional compound of 0.01 to 1% by mole based 
on the mole of the acid component , said multifunctional compound 

having at least three functional groups - identical or different - selected 
from hydroxy and carboxy groups; 
 
   polycondensing the oligomer into an aliphatic copolyester at a 

temperature of 240 to 260°C under reduced pressure of not more than 
133.3 Pa (1 mmHg) in the presence
 of a catalyst; and
 

   melt-extruding the aliphatic copolyester using T die. 
Improved in draw ratio, the aliphatic copolyester film provided 
by the method can be applied to various applications, such as films, 

bottles, glass fiber-reinforced plastics, adhesives, paints.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a novel
method for producing films with an aliphatic copolyester
and, more particularly, to an improvement in the draw ratio
of the films along with the method.Aromatic polyesters, especially polyethylene
terephthalate, are superior in physical and chemical
properties and are widely used to make various
applications, such as films, bottles, glass fiber-reinforced
plastics, adhesives, paints and the like.In contrast, aliphatic polyesters, although used in
the forms of paint or adhesive, lack of processability,
especially moldability to film. In addition, it is
difficult to derive desired melt viscosity and melt
strength therefrom. Furthermore, the films of aliphatic
polyester, if formed, are poor in mechanical physical
properties. That is to say, when aliphatic compounds are
employed as the dicarboxylic acid and glycol components for
polyester, the polyester, even if obtained by
polycondensation after esterification or ester-interchange, 
is not endowed with enough melt viscosity or
melt strength to be formed or processed into a film.
Although it is formed and processed into a film, the final
product is very inferior in workability and mechanical
physical properties.In order to improve the mechanical physical properties
and melt strength, mainly used is a method of increasing
the molecular weight thereof. In this method, however, it
is of importance to appropriately control the increase of
the molecular weight because too large molecular weight of
the polyester may cause to raise the melt viscosity overly,
which in turn results in difficulty in passing through an
extruder on processing.With regard to the melt strength of a polymer, it
chiefly depends on the elasticity of a polymer melt.
Exemplary factors affecting the elasticity include the
distribution of molecular weight, the extent of branch, the
kind and amount of additives. As the molecular weight is
large, as the extent of branch is high and as the
entanglement of polymer melt is serious, the elasticity
becomes enhanced. In case of polyester, full well is it
known that stearic acid, or talc or silica particle brings
the melt strength into effect.In addition, crystallization rate is another factor
having great influence on the moldability of a polymer.
The crystallization rate and crystallinity of a polymer can
be controlled according to a processing method and thus, it 
also is of importance.Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. Heisei 4-189822
