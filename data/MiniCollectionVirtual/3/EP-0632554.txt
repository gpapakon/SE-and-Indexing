<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor 
light-emitting device and, more particularly, to a 
semiconductor light-emitting device capable of emitting 
blue to green light such as a semiconductor laser and a 
light emitting diode. In recent years, there is a demand for 
semiconductor light-emitting devices, particularly, 
semiconductor lasers capable of emitting light with 
short wavelengths for improving recording densities of 
optical disks or resolutions of laser printers, and 
vigorous studies have been made for realization of such 
devices. II-VI compound semiconductors are hopeful as 
materials to be used for fabricating such semiconductor 
light-emitting devices capable of emitting light with 
short wavelengths. In particular, ZnMgSSe compound 
semiconductors, which are quaternary II-VI compound 
semiconductors, are recognized to be suitable as 
materials of cladding layers and optical waveguide 
layers required to make on a GaAs substrate a 
semiconductor laser for emitting blue to green light in 
the band of wavelengths of 400-500nm (see, for example, 
Electron. Lett. 28 (1992) 1798 or Electronics Letters Vol.29, No.9, 766). Such ZnMgSSe compound semiconductors, 
however, involve the problem that they are variable in 
lattice constant and in band gap energy due to changes  
 
in their compositions and make it difficult to stably 
fabricate semiconductor lasers. There is also such a problem, particularly 
with p-type ZnMgSSe compound semiconductors used to 
make p-type cladding layers, that their effective 
impurity concentrations enabling doping are as low as 
1017cm-3, which causes high resistances of p-type 
cladding layers and hence causes generation of heat 
during operation of semiconductor lasers. It is therefore an object of the invention to 
provide a semiconductor light-emitting device using a 
ZnMgSSe compound semiconductor as the material of its 
cladding layer and capable of emitting blue to green 
light, which has good optical confinement 
characteristics and carrier confinement 
characteristics, generates only a small amount of heat 
during operation, and is easily fabricated. According to an aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a semiconductor light-emitting device 
comprising: 
a first cladding layer of a first conduction 
type stacked on a compound semiconductor substrate and 
made of a ZnMgSSe compound semiconductor; an active layer stacked on the first cladding 
layer; and  
 a second cladding layer of a second 
conduction type stacked on the active layer and made of 
a
