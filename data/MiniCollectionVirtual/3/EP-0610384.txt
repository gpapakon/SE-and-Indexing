<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of starting materials for use in the 
synthesis of quinolone antibacterial agents. More particularly, the invention relates to a process 
for preparing certain halo-substituted benzoic acids which may be employed 
in quinolone syntheses, as well as novel compounds useful in such a process. Substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives (hereinafter 
quinolones) are known to be effective antibacterial agents (see, for example, United States 
Patent No. 4,730,000, issued March 8, 1988 to Chu). Halo-substituted benzoic acids and 
their corresponding esters and acetophenones are useful as starting materials in the synthesis of 
such quinolones, as disclosed in the published European patent application of Kumai et al., 
No. 0 303 291, published February 15, 1989. In particular, 2-chloro-4,5-difluorobenzoic acid (CDFBA), 2,4,5-trifluorobenzoic acid 
(TFBA), and their respective analogous acetophenones are advantageous starting materials for 
quinolone synthesis. Known methods of preparing these compounds, however, suffer from a 
number of drawbacks, including complex chemistry requiring specialized equipment; 
expensive or hard-to-obtain starting materials; materials hazards such as those associated with 
the use and decomposition of diazonium salts; and reactions having commercially undesirable 
selectivities and/or yields. There is therefore a continuing need for an improved process for 
preparing the above intermediates which overcomes some or all of these disadvantages. Accordingly, a new process is disclosed for the preparation of CDFBA and TFBA from 
inexpensive and readily available starting materials. In one aspect of the present invention is 
disclosed a method for preparing a compound having the formula 
  
 
wherein X is chloro or fluoro; one of Y and Z is chloro and the other of Y and Z is nitro; and R 
is a radical selected from the group consisting of -CCl3, -CH2NO2, -CH(NO2)R1, 
-CH(CO2R1)2, -CH(C(O)R2)2, -CH(CN)CO2R1, -CH(CO2R1)COR2 and -COR2, where R1 
is alkyl or arylalkyl and R2 is alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl and, where appearing more than once in 
such a radical, R1 and R2 may be the same or different at each occurrence. The method 
comprises reacting a nitrobenzene having the formula 
 
with an appropriate carbanion to form said compound (III). Such a carbanion may be 
generated by reacting a base with a nucleophile such as one selected from the group consisting 
of nitroalkanes, enamines, malonates, beta-ketoesters,
