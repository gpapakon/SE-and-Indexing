<ABSTRACT>
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus 
comprising a base table (16) with a stacking section 

(40) for stacking a rectangular sheet (24), and guide 
members (50) for receiving the rectangular sheet (24) 

and for guiding the rectangular sheet (24) to the 
stacking section (40) of the base table (16); the 

guide members (50) having at least one movable member 
(19) which protrudes out on the stacking section side 

of the base table (16); and the movable member (19) 
which receives the side edge of the rectangular sheet 

(24) floating downwardly, retracts to the outside of 
the stacking section (40) under the weight of the 

rectangular sheet (24), and is movable to protrude 
again towards the stacking section side when freed from 

the weight of the rectangular sheet (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet receiving 
and stacking apparatus for receiving and stacking 
plastics sheets and other kinds of paper which are 
rectangular sheets and, more particularly, is applicable 
to a delivery apparatus in an image forming apparatus 
such as a printing apparatus, for example. Generally, as a sheet receiving and stacking 
apparatus for receiving and stacking rectangular printed 
sheets, a delivery apparatus provided at the discharge 
section of a printing apparatus has been known. This 
type of delivery apparatus 1, as shown in Fig. 1, commonly 
has a base 6, for example a table, for receiving printed paper 
3, a pair of parallel side boards 4, 4 provided 
generally vertically on both sides of the base table 6 
in a direction in which the paper 3 is received, and an 
end plate 5 provided at the forward end of the base 
table 6 in the direction of reception of the paper 3. 
Both side edges of the paper 3 ejected from the printing  
 
section of the printing apparatus 2 are received between 
two side boards 4, 4 which are disposed parallelly, 
generally equal to the width of the paper 3. The 
leading edge of the ejected sheet 3 strikes the end 
plate 5 located at front and floats down to the stack 
section on the base table 6. In such a delivery apparatus 1, in the case of 
printing of a low printing rate on the paper 3, that is, 
in the case of a small amount of printing ink to be 
transferred to the paper 3, the paper 3 is discharged 
out of the printing apparatus 2 without changing its 
flat form; therefore there will occur no problem about 
the stacking of the paper 3 in the delivery apparatus 1. 
However, in the case of a high printing rate, for 
example when much of ink has been transferred to the 
paper 3 as in solid printing, the upper surface of the 
paper 3 to which the ink has been transferred extends 
largely, curling largely downwardly into an upwardly 
swollen form on the whole. The paper 3 discharged from 
the printing apparatus, therefore, will be stacked in a 
disorderly fashion on the base table. To solve this problem, there has been a printing 
apparatus 7 of known art that, as shown in Fig. 2, is 
provided with an auxiliary paper discharge member 8 at  
 
the inlet of the delivery apparatus 10 mounted in the 
paper delivery section. This auxiliary member 8 holds 
upwardly both side edges of the paper 9 in a direction 
of travel of the paper 9 being discharged from the 
printing apparatus 7, bending the paper 9 into a form of 
U letter in the delivery

<CLAIMS>
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus, 
comprising: 


a base (16) with a stacking section (40) for stacking a 
sheet (24) with parallel side edges; and 
a pair of guide members (50) situated on the base (16) 
to be substantially parallel to each other with a space for 

receiving the side edges of the sheet (24) and guiding said 
sheet (24) onto the stacking section of the base (16), each 

guide member (50) having at least one movable member (19) 
protruding to a side of the stacking section (40), said 

movable member (19) having a forward end inclined 
downwardly toward the stacking section, said movable 

members (19) being arranged to receive the side edges of the 
sheet (24) floating downwardly thereto , to retreat 

outwardly from the side of the stacking section and to move 
to protrude again toward the side of the stacking section 

when the sheet (24) falls from the movable members (19), 
characterized in that the movable members (19) are arranged 

to retreat outwardly from the side of the stacking section 
(40) with the weight of the sheet (24). 
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein said movable members (19) are 

axially rotatably mounted on a shaft (18) so that the 
forward ends of said movable members (19) protruding out on 

said stacking section side can approach said stacking 
section (40), and a portion (B) of said movable members  

 
(19) disposed on said shaft (18) outwardly from said 

stacking section (40) requires a greater turning moment 
than a portion (A) protruding from said shaft (18) into 

said stacking section (40), for turning about said shaft 

(18) as a support shaft. 
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein said movable members (19) are 

withdrawable towards the outside of said stacking section 
(40) when said rectangular sheets (24) are taken out. 
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein at least said stacking section 

(40) of said base (26) is bent to a downwardly curved form 
in a plane perpendicular to the direction of discharge of 

said rectangular sheet (24) from an image forming 
apparatus. 
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein each guide member includes 

means for selectively locating the movable member outside 
the stacking section. 
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus as 
claimed in claim 4, wherein said guide members (50) are 

arranged in parallel with the direction of discharge of 
paper (24) ejected from said image forming apparatus. 
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus, 
comprising:  

 

a base (16) with a stacking section (40) for stacking a 
sheet (24) with parallel side edges; and 
a pair of guide members (50) for receiving the side 
edges of the sheet (24) and guiding said sheet (24) onto 

the stacking section of the base (16), said guide members 
(50) including side plates (15) situated on the base (16) 

substantially parallel to each other with a space 
therebetween and having windows (17) therein, and movable 

members (19) with shafts (18), each movable member (19) being 
situated in the window and rotatably attached to the side 

plate by the shafts (18), 
said movable members receiving the 

side edges of the sheet floating downwardly thereto, 
retreating outwardly from a side of the stacking section 

and moving to protrude again toward 
the side of the stacking section when the sheet falls from 

the movable members,  
 

characterized in that each movable member (19) has an 
outer plate portion (B) extending in a direction away from the 

base (16) and an inner plate portion (A) inclined relative to 
the outer plate portion and protruding downwardly toward 

the stacking section (40), 
said outer plate portion having a 

turning moment greater than that of the inner plate portion 
so that when the sheet (24) is disposed on the inner plate 

portion (A), the movable member can rotate easily around the 
shaft by the weight of the sheet for said retreating outwardly 

from said stacking station side. 
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus as  
 

claimed in claim 7, wherein said guide member further 
includes a seat (20) situated adjacent to the window, said seat 

supporting the outer plate portion so that the inner plate 
portion slightly protrudes to the side of the stacking 

section. 
A sheet receiving and stacking apparatus as 
claimed in claim 6, wherein said movable members are 

disposed in one side plate vertically spaced apart from 
each other.
