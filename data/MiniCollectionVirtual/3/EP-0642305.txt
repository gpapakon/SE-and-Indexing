<DESCRIPTION>
The most widely used microbial pesticides are derived from the 
bacterium Bacillusthuringiensis. This bacterial agent is used to control a wide 
range of leaf-eating caterpillars, and mosquitos. Bacillusthuringiensis produces 
a proteinaceous paraspore or crystal which is toxic upon ingestion by a 
susceptible insect host. For example, B.thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD-1 
produces a crystal called a delta toxin which is toxic to the larvae of a number 
of lepidopteran insects. The cloning and expression of a crystal protein gene 
from this B.t. strain in Escherichiacoli has been described in the published 
literature (Schnepf, H.E. and Whitely, H.R. [1981] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 
78:2893-2897). U.S. Patent 4,448,885 and U.S. Patent 4,467,036 both disclose the 
expression of B.t. crystal protein in E.coli. The subject invention concerns a novel Bacillusthuringiensis isolate 
designated B.t. PS158C2, and mutants thereof which are active against 
lepidopteran pests. Also embodied within the subject invention are the delta endotoxin 
genes obtainable from the isolate wherein the genes encode proteins which are 
active against lepidopteran pests. These toxin genes can be transferred to 
suitable hosts via a plasmid vector. Specifically, the invention comprises a novel B.t. isolate denoted B.t. 
PS158C2, mutants thereof, and a novel delta endotoxin genes which encodes 47, 
37, 34 and 32 kDa proteins active against lepidopteran pests.  
 Figure 1 is a photograph of a 9% SDS polyacrylamide gel showing 
alkali-soluble proteins of Bacillusthuringiensis PS158C2 compared to two typical 
lepidopteran-active strains. All previously described B.t. delta endotoxins with lepidopteran activity 
are of the cryI type (130-140 kDa), or cryII (approximately 70 kDa). B.t. 
PS158C2 has a totally different group of smaller proteins, the largest of which 
measure 47 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Colony morphology--Large colony, dull surface, typical B.t.Vegetative cell morphology--typical B.t.Inclusion type--Amorphic Activity--B.t. PS158C2 kills all Lepidoptera tested. Approximate molecular weight of proteins (kDa)--47, 37, 34, 32 Spodopteralittoralis Bioassay--This assay was done with spray-dried 
powder of B.t. strains. First instar larvae were used with 
1% agar diet containing 0.5% spray-dried powder. Mortality 
was read at 7 days. B.t. PS158C2 gave greater than 80% 
mortality. Plutella xylostella Bioassay--Dilutions of a spray-dried powder 
of B.t. PS158C2 were incorporated in the diet, and third instar 
larvae were used. Mortality
