human knee joint, comprising a first joint formed from a first 

joint head (1) and first joint socket (2), and a second joint

(9), which are arranged parallel to one another such that the 
respective axes of rotation (X, Y,/X1, Y1) of the two joints run 

parallel to one another, and such that the second joint is set 
back with respect to the first joint, as seen in the longitudinal 

plane, and the joint heads (1, 8) are rigidly connected to one 
another and the joint sockets (2, 9) are rigidly connected to one 

another, and the joint heads (1, 8) and the joint sockets (2, 9)

have functional faces in mutually perpendicular planes, a 
longitudinal plane and a transverse plane, these functional 

planes having a single circular sectional contour of constant 
radius in each individual plane, the radius of the circular 

sectional contour being different in the two planes and the 
relationships between the curvatures of the functional faces in 

each of the planes either being convex-convex, convex-concave or 
concave-concave, and the joint geometry of the functional faces
