<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hand-held terminal 
for performing, with a very great safety, 

purchasing, debit, credit and drawing operations, 
which terminal comprises a terminal body which can 

be used by an user at any place, and includes a 
keyboard for keying an access code driving an assembly 

for generating a secret code which can be continuously 
changed and can be monitored by a central 

control unit for actuating the functions of the 
hand held terminal, there being moreover provided 

a microprocessor card which can be introduced into 
the terminal to access the services thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hand-held 
terminal for performing purchasing, debit, 
credit and drawing operation, with a very good safety. As is known, a great number of payments 
for purchasing products are at present performed 
through commodities different from the bank services. These commodities, which are broadly advertised 
by several catalogues or broadly diffused 
mass-media, such as, for example, newspapers and TV 
monitors, provide, in fact, the post service as a 
main partner for the financial operations. In order to perform this mass of payments 
through the bank circuit, it is actually necessary 
to define such an architecture specifically adapted 
to allow a like operating facility for the user and 
a capillary availability of places or points at which 
the related operations can be performed. In order to achieve this object, it is 
necessary to provide a very good managing facility 
that is very technically efficient processing properties 
with respect to the financial aspects and,  
 
mainly, with respect to the problems related to a 
proper and safe identification and responsibilization 
of the users. Thus, this problem must be considered under 
the aspect of a true and proper service and, 
mainly, under the safety aspect. With respect to the service aspect, it 
would be comparatively simple to use the modern systems 
based on automatic computerized responders, since 
these devices are conventionally based on a conventional 
phone set, to be used as an access terminal 
for the user, whereas the data collection/response 
center is represented by a fully autonomous computer, 
connected to conventional files. This procedure is undoubtedly easy, since 
it affords the possibility of directly exchanging 
information, but, on the other hand, it has a poor 
performance from the safety standpoint. In fact, in such a procedure, it is not 
conceptually possible to use, as at present occurs 
with the so-called magnetic cards, for example of 
the " bankomat" type, a personal secret code (PIN-personal 
identification number). This type of secret code can not be used  
 
since it does not allow a good safety to be obtained, 
since, after a time period from its telephone 
use, it could be easily counterfeited. In fact, the secret codes used for telephonic 
traffic are, actually, sent in a form which 
can be easily read-out and, moreover, they are constant 
in the time. Because of these reasons, it is possible 
for ill-intentioned persons to easily decipher these 
codes. This problem is

<CLAIMS>
A hand-held terminal (1) suitable for 
performing safely purchasing, debit, credit and 

drawing operations, said hand-held terminal 
comprising a terminal casing (2), which can be used at 

any desired place by the user, and including a 
keyboard (14) for keying thereon an access code, for 

securing access to said hand-held terminal (1), which 
can be monitored by a central control unit for 

actuating services of said hand-held terminal (1), a 
microprocessor card (4) being moreover provided adapted 

to be introduced into said hand-held terminal (1) in 
order to access the services thereof, 
characterized 
by
 a secret code (private key) generating microprocessor assembly (14,12) 
which is adapted to generate a secret code which 

can be continuously changed, allowing the said 
services to be performed in a safe way without any 

electronic connection, wireless or not, to a 
central control unit. 
A hand-held terminal (1), according to 
Claim 1, wherein the secret code (private key) 

generated at a time t is different from a secret 
code generated at a time t+x, x being a variable 

which can be selected at will. 
A hand-held terminal (1), according to  
 

claim 1, wherein said services comprise 
telepayment, electronic purse and usual payment 

services performed safely without the presence of a 
representative of the financial institution and 

without any electronic (wireless or not) connection 
to an external control unit. 
A hand-held terminal (1), according to 
Claim 1, wherein said microprocessor (12) is connected 

to timing clock means (17) to change said secret code in 
agreement with said central control unit.
