<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention, for damping electromagnetic waves, consists in interposing, on the path of the waves, absorbent cables (5), each composed of a filamentary electrical conductor (6) in contact, at least over part of its length, with a ferrimagnetic material (7), and in placing the cables (5) away from each other to form antennas which ensure, via the conductor (6), a flow of induced currents which become dissipated as heat by the ferrimagnetic material (7) and the electrical conductor (6).
