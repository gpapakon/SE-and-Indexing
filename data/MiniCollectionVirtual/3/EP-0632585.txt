<ABSTRACT>
The system includes means (11) for picking up a fraction of the input signal (Ve) of the amplifier (10), means (12) for attenuating the signal picked up, means (15) for detecting the attenuated signal, means (16) for comparison of the detected voltage (Vd) with a reference voltage (Vref) which supply a logic level, control means (17) receiving this logic level and generating a control signal (S) applied to the attenuation means (12) so that the detected voltage (Vd) is substantially equal to the reference voltage (Vref) and means (18) for generating the bias signal (Vp) receiving the control signal (S) from the control means (17), these various means interacting with each other in such a way that the biasing of the amplifier (10) is as low as possible while providing amplification of the input signal without peak limiting (Ve).
