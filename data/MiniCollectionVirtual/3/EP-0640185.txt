Gas-friction vacuum pump (1) with pump stages (3, 12; 26; 
35) of differing design which each comprise a rotor 

section (9, 27, 37) and a casing section (3, 29, 36), 

characterised in that
 three pump stages (3, 12; 26; 35) 
of differing design are provided, in that a filling stage 

with a stator (36) and a rotor (38) is mounted on the 
high-vacuum side upstream of a pump stage (3, 12) on the 

preliminary-vacuum side, the rotor (38) being provided 
with a structure bringing about the supply of gas which 

consists of crosspieces (39) extending radially, the 
incline and width of which decrease from the suction side 

towards the pressure side, in that a turbomolecular-pump 
stage (26) is in turn mounted upstream of the filling 

stage (35) and in that the three pump stages (3, 12, 26, 
35) are detachably connected to one another. 
Pump according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a 
substantially cylindrical section (12) of the rotor (9) 

and a substantially cylindrical casing section (3) form a 
molecular-pump stage on the preliminary-vacuum side with 

a gas-supply channel (20) of annular cross-section. 
Pump according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
section of the rotor (9) located on the high-vacuum side 

is designed to be conical with a diameter that increases 
in the direction of flow (hub 1) and in that it bears 

structures (22) in its conical section that serve to 
supply gas. 
Pump according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 
the filling stage (35) has a central part (38) which is 

designed with a diameter that increases in the direction 
of flow.  

 
Pump according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
conicity of the hub (11) of the rotor (9) conforms 

continuously to the conicity of the central part (38) of 
the filling stage (35). 
Pump according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterised in that
 the front faces which are turned 
towards each other of the rotor sections (9, 27, 37) that 

are to be detachably connected to one another are 
provided with centring means (25, 31). 
Pump according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterised in that
 the casing section (29, 36) of the 
pump stage (26, 35) arranged on the high-vacuum side is 

designed to be integral with a reducing adapter (5).
