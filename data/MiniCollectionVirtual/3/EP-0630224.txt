<ABSTRACT>
A method of impregnating tissues with an aromatic product comprises packing the tissues in a substantially sealed container together with a quantity of a volatile liquid form of the aromatic product, the volatile liquid being contained on an absorbent base which is separated from the tissues by means of a film which prevents the flow of liquid from the base to the tissues but permits the evaporation of the volatile liquid to liberate the aromatic products for absorption by the tissues. Preferably, the base is located in an envelope formed of the film whereby the film and base together form a sachet. In the case where the container is a cylinder and the tissues take the form of an open-centred roll the sachet is preferably located within the open centre of the roll.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPREGNATION OF TISSUES WITH AROMATIC PRODUCTSThis invention relates to the impregnation of tissues with aromatic products, and to a package of tissues impregnated with aromatic products.For various reasons, it is desirable to provide tissues which are impregnated with an aromatic product. The term "aromatic" as used herein is used to indicate a product having an aroma, rather than in the strictly chemical sense of indicating an organic compound having an unsaturated ring containing alternating double and single bonds.Where it is desirable or acceptable for the impregnated tissue to be "wet" the application of the aromatic product can be accomplished by incorporating the aromatic product within the wetting liquid which is applied to the tissue. However, it is desirable for certain applications for the impregnated tissues to be "dry" - that is to have only a natural or close to natural water content, and not be wetted by a non-aqueous liquid.One means of achieving impregnation of dry tissues with aromatic products is to seal the tissues into a container in which a quantity of the aromatic product, in volatile liquid form, is contained. Over a certain period of maturation the volatile material evaporates and the aromatic products impregnate the tissues. With such a process, it is highly desirable that the volatile liquid 

does not come into direct contact with the tissues. If it does, and if the tissues are used after a relatively short maturation period there is a danger that excessive aromatic materials may be contained in relatively few of the tissues adjacent to the point of liquid contact, whilst the other tissues do not have sufficient aromatic content. Further, if at the time of use volatile liquid is still present on a tissue this may come into contact with the skin and cause an undesirable reaction. This is particularly the case if, for example, the product is intended for use by a person suffering from a cold and the tissue is applied to inflamed skin around the nose. Under these circumstances, if a liquid volatile ingredient such as camphor or menthol is present on the tissue a painful reaction with the skin can occur.With a view to avoiding direct contact between the volatile liquid and the tissues the prior art provided a technique whereby the volatile liquid is deposited onto a cotton wool ball located in the bottom of an empty container, a plastic spacer was placed on top of the cotton wool ball, and a roll of tissues was placed in the container to rest on top of the spacer.

CLAIMS
1. A method of impregnating tissues with an aromatic product comprising packing the tissues in a substantially sealed container together with a quantity of a volatile liquid form of the aromatic product, the volatile liquid being contained on an absorbent base which is separated from the tissues by way of a film which prevents flow of liquid from the base to the tissue but permits the evaporation of the volatile liquid to liberate the aromatic product to portions of the container housing the tissues.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the absorbent base is part of a sachet at least one wall of which is formed by the separating means.
3. A method according to claim 2 wherein the container is substantially cylindrical and comprising the steps of loading into the container a roll of tissues having an open central region, and inserting the sachet into the open central region of the roll prior to sealing the container.
4. A container of tissues, the container being substantially sealed to define an internal chamber in which the tissues are housed, the chamber also housing an absorbent base containing a volatile liquid form of an aromatic product; and means separating the base from the tissues, the separating means preventing flow of volatile liquid from the base to the tissues but permitting passage of evaporated aromatic products from the base to the tissues. 


5. A container of tissues according to claim 4 wherein the absorbent base forms part of a sachet at least one wall of which is formed by the separating means.
6. A container of tissues according to claim 5 wherein the sachet comprises the base and an envelope formed of the separating means.
7. A container of tissues according to any preceding claim wherein the separating means comprises a perforated polymeric film, preferably a perforated polyolefin film.
8. A container of tissues according to any preceding claim wherein the base comprises cotton wool or cellulose wadding or comminuted wood pulp or a combination of these materials.
9 A container of tissues according to any of claims 4 to 9 wherein the aromatic product comprises Eucalyptus Oil, Menthol, Thymol, Camphor, Nutmeg and Pine Oils, Borneol, Methyl Salicylate, or Lavender Oil or a combination of these products.
10. A container of tissues according to any of claims 4 to 8 wherein the aromatic product comprises Lavender, Tea-tree, Neroli, Bergamot, Camomile, Ylang Ylang, Orange, Lemon, Lemongrass, Rosemary, Rosewood and Rose, Camphor, Eucalyptus and Peppermint or a combination of these products.
