<ABSTRACT>
A composite material capable of being deep-drawn and/or stretch-formed is disclosed, for example for producing stretch-formed containers for pharmaceuticals. The composite material contains a metallic layer and a plastic layer arranged on each side of the metallic layer. The metallic layer is 8 to 80  mu m thick and the plastic layers are each 20 to 50  mu m thick. The plastic layers contain or are made of polyamide-based thermoplastics.

<CLAIMS>
Deep-drawn and/or stretch-formed container with a plurality of compartments,
recesses or cups (blister packs) made from a deep-drawable and/or stretch-formable

composite material, the composite material having a metal layer and a
plastic layer on either side of the metal layer and the metal layer having a

thickness of 8 to 80 µm, characterised in that the plastic layers each have a
thickness of 20 to 30 µm, the plastic layers contain or consist of polyamide-based

thermoplastics and the polyamide-based thermoplastics are biaxially oriented
polyamide films.
Container according to claim 1, characterised in that the metal layer is a foil or a
thin strip of aluminium or an aluminium alloy.
Container according to claim 1, characterised in that the polyamide-based
thermoplastics are a polycaprolactam or a copolymer thereof.
Container according to claim 1, characterised in that the plastic layers contain or
consist of polyamide-based thermoplastics and at least one of the polyamide-based

thermoplastics is provided on at least one side with a sealing layer.
Container according to claim 1, characterised in that the thicknesses of the two
plastic layers differ by 0 to 20 %.
Use of the container according to claim 1 for the freeze-drying of pharmaceutical
formulations.
Process for the production of containers according to claim 1, characterised in that
the composite materials are cold deep-drawn and/or stretch-formed.
Container according to claim 1 for use in the freeze-drying of pharmaceutical
formulations, made from the deep-drawable and/or stretch-formable composite

material.
