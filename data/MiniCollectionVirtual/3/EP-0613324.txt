or like device, the ear tip being of a construction and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ear tip for terminal
attachment to a sound transmitting device such as a
stethoscope, audio headset, acoustic speaker or the like.Among the myriad devices employing ear tips,
stethoscopes and audio headsets are among the most common.
Both of these devices typically employ a spring-loaded means
for forcing the ear tips into the user's ears in an attempt
to create a sound-proof seal that maximizes the wearer's
ability to hear only the desired sound free of ambient
interference. This general design creates two related
problems for the user. First, the exterior ear canal is
rather sensitive to pressure and second, the ear canal
varies in size and shape from person to person. Thus, hard
conventional ear tips can cause serious discomfort by
applying high pressure to the irregular surface of the
user's ear canal. Furthermore, such hard ear tips form a
poor acoustic seal with the ear, allowing ambient sound to
infiltrate the ear canal and obscure the sound delivered by
the device.These problems of comfort and sound exclusion have been
addressed in a number of ways, both as to ear tips and as to
ear plugs. Soft, malleable materials such as air encased in
a plastic bladder (U.S. Patents 3,895,627, 3,768,470, and
4,089,332), a mushroom shaped soft rubber head (U.S. Patent
3,618,600), malleable plastic (U.S. Patent 4,552,137), and
closed-cell foam encased in a plastic shell (U.S. Patent
4,434,794) are described in the patent literature.Design variations such as a flared, horn- shaped ear
tip designed to fit over rather than into the ear canal
(U.S. Patent 3,303,902), various shapes with skirt-like
flanges that insert into the ear canal (U.S. Patents,
4,564,009 and 3,896,801, G.B. Patent 2,173,110 A), and soft 
mushroom-shaped ear tips (U.S. Patents 4,055,233 and
3,539,031) have appeared as well. All such inventions rely
upon pressure to create a good acoustic seal.A further design, appearing in U.S. Patent 4,552,137,
teaches a solution where a tight fit is attained not by
pressure but by a layer of adhesive on the ear tip's
surface.US-A-3,895,627, mentioned above, discloses an ear tip
adapted to deliver sounds to a human ear, which ear tip
comprises a first section adapted to couple with a sound
transmitting device and a second section connected to and
in open communication with the first section, the second
section comprising (a) walls defining a bulbous second
section with a convex inner surface, which inner surface
defines a hollow inner chamber, and (b) a proximal port
