<ABSTRACT>
A photomultiplier has a focusing electrode plate (7) 
for supporting focusing electrodes, provided between 

a photocathode (3) and a dynode unit (60). Since the focusing 
electrode plate has holding springs (7a,7b) which are 

integrally formed with the focusing electrode plate, 
resistance-welding becomes unnecessary to prevent 

field discharge. A concave portion is formed in a 
main surface of the focusing electrode plate to 

arrange an insulating member (8a,8b) sandwiched between the 
focusing electrode plate and the photoelectron 

incidence side of the dynode unit and partially in 
contact with the concave portion. With this 

structure, discharge between the focusing electrode 
plate and the dynode unit can be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
photomultiplier. Conventionally, photomultipliers have been widely 
used for various measurements in nuclear medicine and 
high-energy physics as a γ-camera, PET (Positron 
Emission Tomography), or calorimeter. A conventional photomultiplier is constituted by 
a photocathode, provided inside a cylindrical bottomed 
vacuum container and deposited on the surface of a 
light receiving plate for receiving incident light, 
for emitting photoelectrons, focusing electrodes for 
focusing the orbits of the photoelectrons, and an 
electron multiplier, including an anode and a dynode 
unit provided between the photocathode and the anode, 
for receiving and cascade-multiplying the 
photoelectrons. A contact terminal, a terminal holding block, and 
an aluminum film have hitherto been required to supply 
a current to  
 
the photocathode. Additionally, at least four holding 
springs are required for one focusing electrode plate 
to stably support an electron multiplier with respect 
to the inner wall of the vacuum tube (housing). When at least one contact terminal and four 
holding springs are provided at the time of 
assembling, two portions are resistance-welded for 
each component, and in total, ten portions must be 
welded. Normally, the welding points are oxidized or 
burred. Therefore, upon application of a high 
voltage, each welding point serves as an electron 
emitting source to cause field discharge to increase 
the noise. For this reason, the photomultiplier must have a 
structure with a small number of welding points. The present invention aims to provide a 
photomultiplier which decreases the number of 
constituent components to reduce the noise, thereby 
improving reliability and operation efficiency at the 
time of assembling and preventing discharge. However, according to the present invention, 
without fixing at least seven components at 
predetermined positions by resistance-welding and 
depositing an aluminum film on the inner wall of the 
vacuum tube, the operation efficiency at the time of 
welding or assembling is improved.  
 According to the present invention there is 
provided a photomultiplier comprising: a housing 
having an inner wall; a photocathode for emitting 
photoelectrons; a focusing electrode plate; a dynode 
unit for receiving and cascade-multiplying 
photoelectrons incident thereon, the dynode unit 
comprising a plurality of dynode plates each 
supporting at least one dynode and being stacked 
together with said focusing electrode plate by way
