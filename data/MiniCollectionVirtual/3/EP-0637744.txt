<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for analyzing a solution for 
an agglutination pattern. The method comprises the 

steps of producing an illuminated image of the solution 
on an array of pixels, and assigning to each pixel in 

the illuminated image, a data value representing the 
intensity of the illuminated image on the pixel. 

With the 
preferred processing procedure, the pixel array is 

separated into a plurality of zones, and the data values 
for the pixels in each zone are processed according to a 

respective predetermined procedure to determine values 
for a predefined set of variables. Then, those 

determined values are processed to determine whether an 
agglutination pattern is present in the solution, and if 

so, to classify that pattern into one of the predefined 
classes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a method and
system for the detection and quantification of
agglutinates formed in response to immunological
agglutination reactions, and more particularly, to such
a method and system employing automated image and data
processing means to automatically detect and classify
agglutination patterns.Immunological agglutination reactions are used
for identifying various kinds of blood types and for
detecting various kinds of antibodies and antigens in
blood samples and other aqueous solutions. In a
conventional procedure, a sample of red blood cells is
mixed with serum or plasma in test tubes or microplates,
and the mixture may then be incubated and centrifuged.
Various reactions either occur or do not occur depending
on, for example, the blood type of the red blood cells
or whether certain antibodies are present in the blood
sample. Typically, these reactions manifest themselves
as clumps of cells or particles with antigens and
antibodies on their surfaces, referred to as
agglutinates. Thus, the absence of any such clumps
indicates that no reaction has occurred; and the
presence of such clumps indicates that a reaction has
occurred, with the size and amount of such clumps being
a quantitative indicator of the level or concentration
in the sample, or an indicator of the reaction strength,
affinity of the complex for which the blood sample was tested. Recently, a new agglutination test method
--referred to as column agglutination technology, or
CAT-- has been developed. Column Agglutination
Technology may be defined as the analysis of blood and
blood products utilizing filtration as a means of
separating agglutinated, precipitated, absorbed, or
adsorbed particulate components from non-reactive
components for immunoassay applications. In this
method, gel or glass bead microparticles are contained
within a small column, referred to as a microcolumn. A
reagent such as anti-IgG is dispensed in a diluent in
the microcolumn and test red blood cells are placed in a
reaction chamber above the column. The column, which is
typically one of a multitude of columns formed in a
transparent cassette, is centrifuged. The centrifuging
accelerates the reaction, if any, between the reagent
and the blood cells, and also urges the cells toward the
bottom of the column. The glass beads or gel in the
microcolumn act as a filter, however, and resist or
impede downward movement of the particles in the column.
As a result, the nature and distribution of the
particles in the microcolumn after
