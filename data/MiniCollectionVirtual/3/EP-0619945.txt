<ABSTRACT>
A water filtering apparatus (12B) for an 
ornamental fish water tank (1) includes a filter mechanism 

for filtering water in the water tank, a filter tank casig 
(12bd) housig the filter mechanism, a lid (12bu) covering 

an open top portion of the filter tank casing, at least 
two hinge portions (13) mounted on either the filter tank 

casing (12bd) or the lid (12bu), and at least two rotary 
shaft supporting portions (16) mounted on either the lid 

(12bu) or the filter tank casing (12bd). Each of the 
hinge portions (13) includes a rotary shaft (14) and 

supporting pieces (15) supporting the rotary shaft. Each 
of the rotary shaft supporting portions (16) includes a 

bearing (17) for rotatably supporting the rotary shaft 
such that the rotary shaft can be inserted in and removed 

from the bearing and a resilient piece (18) provided with 
a claw portion (18n) for preventing escape of the rotary 

shaft from the bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water filtering 
apparatus for an ornamental fish water tank of an 
ornamental fish keeping system for keeping ornamental 
fish, in particular tropical fish. GB-A-2,226,940 discloses such 
an apparatus having the features as set forth in the preamble portion of claim 1. An ornamental fish keeping system consists of a 
water tank, a cover, an ornamental fish illuminating 
device, and a filtering apparatus for the ornamental fish 
water tank. Of the various parts of the ornamental fish 
keeping system, the filtering apparatus physically and 
biologically filters and removes foul matter from the 
water in the water tank. The filtering apparatus and the illuminating 
device have generally been designed to be used as a cover 
or lid for the open top portion of the water tank. The conventional filtering apparatus has a 
filtering mechanism for filtering water sucked up from the 
water tank by a pump. The filtering mechanism is housed 
in a filter tank casing and a lid is placed on the casing 
so as to cover its open top. As a result, by simply removing the lid from the 
filter tank casing the filter medium of the filtering 
mechanism can be easily checked for clogging of the medium 
and other required repairs.  
 According to the conventional water filtering 
apparatus for an ornamental fish water tank, the lid is 
simply placed on the filter tank casing, so that it is 
necessary to transfer it to a suitable surface after it is 
taken off the filtering apparatus for maintenance and 
inspection of the filtering mechanism. Consequently, when no suitable surface is 
available for placing the lid of the water filtering 
apparatus or the filter tank casing, it is necessary to 
prepare one near the apparatus or the casing. In addition, caution is needed to prevent 
wetting of the receiving surface by water drops adhering 
to the inner surface of the lid. The present invention has been accomplished to 
overcome the aforesaid inconveniences and problems of the 
conventional water filtering apparatus for an ornamental 
fish water tank. It is the object of the present invention to 
provide a water filtering apparatus for an ornamental fish 
water tank provided with a filter tank casing and a lid 
mounted on the casing and more particularly to provide 
such a water filtering apparatus wherein the top portion 
of the filter tank casing can be opened for maintenance 
and inspection of a filter mechanism without removing the 
lid and wherein the lid can easily be removed from the 
filter tank
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A water filtering apparatus (12B) for an 
ornamental fish water tank (1), comprising a filter 

mechanism for filtering water in the water tank, a filter 
tank casing (12bd) housing the filter mechanism, and a lid 

(12bu) covering an open top portion of the filter tank 
casing, said water filtering apparatus (12B) being 

characterised in that it comprises at least two hinge 
portions (13) mounted on either the filter tank casing 

(12bd) or the lid (12bu) and each consisting of a rotary 
shaft (14) and supporting pieces (15) supporting said 

rotary shaft, and at least two rotary shaft supporting 
portions (16) mounted on either the lid (12bu) or the 

filter tank casing (12bd) and each consisting of a bearing 
(17) for rotatably supporting said rotary shaft such that 

said rotary shaft can be inserted in and removed from said 
bearing and a resilient piece (18) provided with a claw 

portion (18n) for preventing escape of said rotary shaft 
from said bearing. 
The water filtering apparatus according to 
claim 1, characterised in that said supporting pieces (15) 

abut against said filter tank casing (12bd) or said lid 
(12bu) to hold said lid (12bu) open after said lid (12bu) 

has been rotated around said rotary shaft (14) to open the 
top portion of said filter tank casing (12bd).  

 
The water filtering apparatus according to 
claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that engagement of 

said hinge portions (13) with said rotary shaft supporting 
portions (16) restricts said lid (12bu) from moving 

parallel to said rotary shaft (14).
