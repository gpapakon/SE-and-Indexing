<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a novel polysaccharide derivative having a main 
structure of the following formula (1) in which a polysaccharide or its 

derivative has been chemically bonded to the inner and outer surfaces of 
the pores of a porous carrier at the reducing terminal of the 

polysaccharide or polysaccharide derivative. 

   Also provided are a method of producing the novel polysaccharide 
derivative in which a silane agent is chemically bonded to a porous 

carrier and thereafter a polysaccharide having a degree of 
polymerization from 11 to 500 or its derivative is further chemically 

bonded to surface treated carrier at the reducing terminal of the 
polysaccharide or its derivative, and a method of producing the novel 

polysaccharide derivative in which a polysaccharide having a degree of 
polymerization from 11 to 500 or its derivative is chemically bonded to 

a silane agent at the reducing terminal of the polysaccharide or its 
derivative and thereafter the polysaccharide derivative is further 

chemically bonded to a porous carrier. Further provided is a 
separating agent for chromatography containing the novel polysaccharide 

derivative. The novel polysaccharide derivative has excellent solvent 
resistance and is useful as a separating agent for chiral resolution of 

chiral compounds by chromatography. The methods of the present 
invention efficiently give the novel polysaccharide derivative.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of producing and use of polysaccharide
derivatives. More precisely,
it relates to polysaccharide derivatives where a silane agent and
a porous silica gel carrier have been chemically bonded to each other
and a polysaccharide has been bonded to the resulting compound at its
reducing terminal and where particular substituent(s) has/have been
introduced into a part or all of the hydroxyl groups in the
polysaccharide moiety, and also to methods of producing them and use of
them.Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Chemistry Edition
Vol. 23, 1395-1405 (1985) relates to the specific
modification of the reducing end groups of dextran by
using the reductive amination procedure and solvent
systems designed to optimized polymer reactivity.It has heretofore been known that a separating agent comprising
a compound where silica gel has been modified to physically carry a
polysaccharide, such as cellulose or amylose, or a derivative thereof is
useful for optical resolution.However, since the compound has poor solvent resistance, it has
such a drawback that, when it is used in liquid chromatography or the
like, it limits the usable eluent. In addition, the usefulness of the
polysaccharide cannot sufficiently be drawn out of it and it limits
also the washing solution that is to be used for washing contaminated
columns, by which the columns are often deteriorated.In order to overcome the problems, it has been proposed to use a
compound where a polysaccharide derivative has been chemically bonded  
to silica gel. In the compound, however, since the site of the
polysaccharide derivative, to which silica gel is to be chemically
bonded, cannot be specifically defined, the bonded silica gel has an
influence on the higher structure of the polysaccharide itself to lower
the useful properties of the polysaccharide. Hence, the compound has
such a serious problem. In addition, since the bonding site of the
polysaccharide derivative cannot be specifically defined, there occurs
still another problem that the unevenness in the quality of the silica
gel compound to be obtained is noticeable.EP-0 625 524 relates to substances in which a polysaccharide
is chemically bonded to a silica gel at its reducing
terminal alone as well as to methods for producing them and
to a separating agent for use in chromatography containing
the same.Manssur Yalpani, Polysaccharides, pages 294 to 295, 1988
mentions the condensation of reducing end groups of
polysaccharides via amide and amine linkages to a variety
