<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a composition comprising a Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein and a lipid carrier, and a method of forming said composition. This invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein and a pharmaceutically acceptable lipid carrier, and a method of forming said pharmaceutical composition. This invention further provides a method of detecting and a method of quantitatively determining the amount of lipopolysaccharide in a sample. This invention further provides a method of coating a surgical tool with a Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein and a method of coating an implantable, invasive device with a Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein. This invention further provides a method of decontaminating a fluid containing lipopolysaccharide prior to administration of the fluid into a subject. This invention further provides a method of treating a subject suffering from an endotoxemia-related disorder. Finally, this invention provides a method of preventing endotoxemia in a subject.

<DESCRIPTION>
Gram negative infections are a major cause of morbidity
and mortality, especially in hospitalized and
immunocompromised patients. [Duma, R.J., Am. J. of Med.,
78 (Suppl. 6A): 154-164 (1985); and Kreger B.E., D.E.
Craven and W.R. McCabe, Am. J. Med., 68: 344-355 (1980)].
Although available antibiotics are generally effective in
containing the infection, they do nothing to neutralize
the pathophysiological effects associated with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS).LPS, or endotoxin, is a major component of the outer
membrane of gram negative bacteria and is released when
the organisms are lysed [Ahenep, J.L. and K.A. Morgan, J.
Infect. Dis., 150 (3): 380-388 (1984)].LPS released during antibiotic therapy is a potent
stimulator of the inflammatory response. Many
detrimental effects of LPS in vivo result from soluble
mediators released by inflammatory cells (Morrison D.C.
and R.J. Ulevich, Am. J. Pathol., 93 (2): 527-617
(1978)]. LPS induces the release of mediators by host
inflammatory cells which may ultimately result in 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), adult
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac
dysfunction, organ failure, liver failure (hepatobiliary
dysfunction), brain failure (CNS dysfunction), renal
failure, multi-organ failure and shock.Soluble LPS causes decreased neutrophil chemotaxis,
increased adhesiveness, elevated hexose monophosphate
shunt activity and O2 radical production, upregulation of
surface receptors for complement, and release of granule
proteins into the surrounding medium [Morrison and
Ulevich (1978)].Both specific and azurophil compartments degranulate in
response to LPS (Bannatyne, R.M., N.M. Harnett, K.Y. Lee
and W.D. Rigger, J. Infect. Dis., 156 (4): 469-474
(1977)). Azurophil proteins released in response to LPS
may be both harmful and beneficial to the host.
Neutrophil elastase causes degradation of protease
inhibitors responsible for suppressing the coagulation
cascade. This results in coagulopathies such as
disseminated intravascular coagulation, a potentially
lethal consequence of endotoxemia. Azurophil granules
also contain bactericidal molecules such as
myeloperoxidase and naturally occurring BPI Protein.Endotoxemia is a condition associated with the presence
of endotoxins, i.e. heat stable bacterial toxins, in the
blood. Endotoxins elicit an inflammatory response that is
beneficial in fighting the infection but can be damaging
to the host if uncontrolled. Endotoxemia induces
production of endotoxin-binding proteins from the liver 
and causes release of

A method of detecting lipopolysaccharide in a sample
which comprises contacting the sample with

composition comprising a Bactericidal/Permeability
Increasing Protein and a lipid carrier, wherein the

Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein is
solubilized in the lipid carrier, under conditions such

that a lipopolysaccharide-Bactericidal/Permeability
Increasing Protein complex is formed, and detecting the

lipopolysaccharide-Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing
Protein complex, thereby detecting the lipopolysaccharide

in the sample.
A method of quantitatively determining the amount of
lipopolysaccharide in a sample which comprises

contacting the sample with a composition comprising a
Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein and a

lipid carrier, wherein the Bactericidal/Permeability
Increasing Protein is solubilized in the lipid carrier,

under conditions such that a lipopolysaccharide-Bactericidal/Permeability
Increasing Protein complex is

formed, and quantitatively determining the amount of
the lipopolysaccharide-Bactericidal/Permeability

Increasing Protein complex, thereby quantitatively
determining the amount of lipopolysaccharide in the

sample.
The method of anyone of claims 1 or 2, wherein the
lipid carrier comprises a liposome.
The method of anyone of claims 1 or 2, wherein the
lipid carrier comprises a non-ionic detergent.
