<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reverse conducting 
gate-turnoff thyristor, and more particularly to a 
reverse conducting gate-turnoff thyristor which has an 
improved structure for isolating a switching device 
section and a diode section from each other. A reverse conducting switching device, such as a 
reverse conducting gate-turnoff thyristor is generally 
comprised of a GTO (Gate-Turnoff) thyristor and a 
freewheel diode which are formed in a single semiconductor 
substrate in the form of an integrated circuit. 
The freewheel diode connected in inverse parallel to the 
GTO thyristor. A GOT thyristor is a semiconductor 
device which serves to miniaturize a device, such as an 
inverter, which incorporates the thyristor. The semiconductor 
substrate in which a reverse conducting GTO 
thyristor is formed has a thyristor section and a diode 
section. The thyristor section in which the GTO 
thyristor is formed and the diode section in which the 
freewheel diode is formed are electrically isolated by a 
resistor. A conventional reverse conducting GTO thyristor 
will be described with reference to FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 1, an n-type layer 501 consists of 
an n-type base layer 501a and an n-type impurity layer 
501b. A mesa-etched, p-type base layer 502a is provided 
on the upper surface of the n-type base layer 501a.  
 
An n-type emitter layer 504 is provided on the mesa-shaped 
part of a p-type base layer 502a. A p-type 
emitter layer 503 is provided on the lower surface of 
the n-type base layer 501a. The p-type emitter layer 
503, the n-type base layer 501a, the p-type base layer 
502 and the n-type emitter layer 504 constitute a four-layer 
pnpn structure which is a GTO (Gate-Turnoff) 
thyristor section A. A p-type impurity layer 502b is provided on the 
upper surface of the n-type impurity layer 501b, 
forming a two-layer pn structure which is a diode 
section B. The GTO section A has an anode electrode 508a provided 
on the lower surface of the p-type emitter layer 
503. The diode section B has a cathode electrode 508b 
provided on the lower surface of the n-type impurity 
layer 501b. The anode electrode 508a and the cathode 
electrode 508b form an integral layer. The GTO section 
A has a cathode electrode 505 provided on the upper 
surface of the n-type emitter layer 504, and a gate 
electrode 506 provided on that part of the p-type base 
layer 502a which are not mesa-shaped. The diode section 
B has an anode electrode 507 provided on the upper 
surface of the p-type impurity layer 502b. A
