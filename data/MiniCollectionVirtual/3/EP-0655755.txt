<ABSTRACT>
The power capacitor includes at least one capacitor winding, of the self-healing type, arranged in a plastic housing and coated in a polymerisable resin cast directly into the housing. The capacitor includes a cut-off device sensitive to over-pressure. The passage of the gases towards the cut-off device is provided for by deformation of the plastic constituting the housing. The plastic of the housing exhibits predetermined characteristics of mechanical toughness, of impact resistance and thermal behaviour.
