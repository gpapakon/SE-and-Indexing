<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle such as a missile (20) includes an 
aerodynamically shaped missile body (22) having a 

longitudinal centerline, a set of control surfaces 
(26) joined to the missile body (22), and, 

preferably, a propulsion system (28) operable to 
drive the missile body (22) forwardly. A 

cylindrical rotational bearing (32) is mounted on 
the missile body (22) with its cylindrical axis 

parallel to the longitudinal centerline (24) of the 
missile body. A flexible band wing (38) is 

supported from the rotational bearing (32). The 
flexible band wing (38) may rotate about the 

centerline (24) of the missile body (22) responsive 
to aerodynamic forces exerted on the missile body 

(22) and the flexible band wing (38) to aid in 
making maneuvers without requiring the missile (20) 

to bank to align the flexible band wing (38) with 
the direction of the maneuver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the flight control
of winged vehicles, and, more particularly, to the
control of missiles having an aerodynamically shaped body having a longitudinal centerline and utilizing a flexible band wing.Such a vehicle is known from DE-A-3516367.Missiles typically have an aerodynamically
shaped body, a propulsion system, and some approach
for controlling the direction of movement of the
missile. Control may be achieved in any of several
ways, such as movable control surfaces mounted
directly or indirectly to the body, gimballed
engines, or thrusters. Some missiles rely solely
upon the lift of the body and the thrust of the
engines to achieve flight, while others have Wings
to provide lift.One type of wing useful on missiles that must
be stored in a limited space before launch is the
flexible band wing. The wing includes a flexible
band that is mounted to the body of the missile with
hinged, collapsible struts. When the missile is
carried aboard a launch vehicle such as an aircraft,
the struts are collapsed against the body of the
missile and the flexible band is wrapped around the
body of the missile to conserve space. The flexible
band is held in place with a retention mechanism,
such as a releasable strap. Upon launch, the strap
is released and the mechanical stresses incurred by
wrapping the wing around the body cause the band to
unwrap itself, so that it pulls it away from the
body of the missile. The strut hinges open
outwardly to extend the struts. The flexible band
is thereby supported and constrained to lie on a
generally semicircular arc around the body of the
missile, generating upward lift as the missile 
flies. The lifting force is transmitted into the
body of the missile through the struts. The
flexible band wing can provide significant benefits
to flight of the missile, such as extended range due
to the increased lift provided by the flexible band
wing, at little size penalty when stored.To turn a missile having a flexible band
wing, control surfaces at the nose or tail of the
missile are operated responsive to a controller
system. The flexible band wing itself has no
control surfaces. The control surface movements
generate aerodynamic forces which tend to push the
nose or tail of the missile to the side. The result
is that the tail or nose, respectively, of the
missile is pushed in the desired direction to
initiate the turn.The presence of the flexible wing, however,
may adversely affect the ability of the missile to
turn responsive to the control forces. It is
observed
