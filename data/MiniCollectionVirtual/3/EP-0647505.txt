<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and to an installation for treating coated or otherwise metal workpieces. The installation comprises a shot peening tunnel (10) through which the workpieces to be treated are moved. Fans (36 to 42) make it possible to project at high speed jets of particles which are preferably made of zinc on to the workpieces to be treated. The workpiece is thus simultaneously cleaned and laden with zinc.

<CLAIMS>
A method of cleaning and reloading optionally coated metal
parts comprising dirt, the method being 
characterised in that
 it comprises
a step of subjecting said part at ambient temperature and for a

predetermined length of time to a high-speed jet of particles, said particles
being completely made of a metal selected from the group comprising zinc

and aluminium, said particles are projected in such a manner as to cause
the surface of the part to be heated at a temperature less than or equal to

60Â°C under the effect of the shocks from the particles, thereby causing
said particles to melt by being crushed against said part, thereby

simultaneously cleaning the part and forming a thin adherent surface layer
of the order of 7 to 10 microns constituted by the zinc or the aluminium.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
metal is zinc and 
in that
 said particles are of dimensions less than or equal
to 1 mm.
A method according to any one of claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that
 the particles have a speed which is greater than 50
m/s.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 said parts are galvanized.
