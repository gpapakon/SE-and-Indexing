<ABSTRACT>
A rotary clothes drier has a mast 1, on which arms 4 carrying the washing line are articulated via a sliding star 2. Provided between the arms 4 and the mast 1 are spreading arms 6 which are pivotably attached, on the one hand, to a holding star 3 fastened to the mast 1 and, on the other hand, to the arms 4. To make it easier to stretch out the rotary drier in the initial stage, there is arranged in the mast 1 a spreading body 9 which cooperates with supporting elements 13 attached to the spinning arms 6 and which, as a result of displacement by means of a pull cord 15, pivots the spinning arms until the arms 4 can be swung open without much effort by pushing up the sliding star 2.

Rotary clothes drier having an upright pole (1) 
on which there are pivotably mounted, in a sliding star 

(2), arms (4) which bear the washing lines and are 
supported by open-out arms (6) which are mounted pivotably, 

on the one hand, in a retaining star (3) on the 
pole (1) by means of retaining pins (8) and, on the other 

hand, on the arms (4) by means of articulation pins (7), 
characterized in that an open-out body (9) is fitted in 

a longitudinally displaceable manner on the pole (1), 
beneath the retaining pins (8), which open-out body 

interacts with supporting elements (13) fitted on the 
open-out arms (6) and, in the event of a longitudinal 

displacement, pivots the open-out arms out of their 
swung-in rest position. 
Rotary clothes drier according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the open-out body (9) is arranged 

in the pole (1) and can be displaced, via a drawing cable 
(15), into its position in which the open-out arms (6) 

are opened out. 
Rotary clothes drier according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the drawing cable (15) is fastened, 

by means of one end, on the pole (1) and is guided over 
a first pulley (16) on the open-out body (9) and a second 

pulley (18) on the sliding star (12), and in that the 
sliding star (2) can be connected to the pole (1) via a 

releasable arresting means. 
Rotary clothes drier according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the arresting means has a hook (20) 

which is fitted on a component (22) with handle (21),  
 

which component is fastened on the sliding star (2) such 
that it can be pivoted about the axis of rotation of the 

second pulley (18) and can be moved, counter to the 
spring (23), into a position in which the arresting means 

is released. 
Rotary clothes drier according to Claims 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the end of the drawing cable (15) 

is fastened on the retaining star (3), and in that the 
open-out body (9) has a continuation (10) which extends 

through the retaining star (3) and bears the first pulley 
(16). 
Rotary clothes drier according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the open-out body (9) is 

conical. 
Rotary clothes drier according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the open-out body (9) has a number 

of ribs (12) which corresponds to the number of open-out 
arms (6), the edges (12a) of which ribs lie on a lateral 

surface of the cone. 
Rotary clothes drier according to one of Claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the supporting elements 

(13) are clipped into through-passages (13a) in the open-out 
arms (6) and, when the open-out arms are in the rest 

position, extend through through-passages (14) in the 
wall of the pole (1). 
Rotary clothes drier according to one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterized by a stop against which the open-out 

body (9) rests in its open-out position. 
Rotary clothes drier according to Claims 5 and 9, 
characterized in that the stop is formed by the bottom 

end of a sleeve (11) which is integrally formed on the 
retaining star (3) and guides the continuation (10) of 

the open-out body (9).
