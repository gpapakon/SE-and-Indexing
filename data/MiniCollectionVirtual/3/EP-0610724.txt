<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a dispenser for feeding 
out convenient units of two liquid products, said 

dispenser (1) being preferably intended for manual 
handling and manual feed-out of viscous products such 

as mustard (2) and ketchup (3) or similar sauces on 
food products such as hamburger bread rolls (4) or the 

like. To bring about an essential reduction of the time 
earlier required for feeding out convenient units of 

the two liquid products (2, 3) the dispenser (1) comprises 
a first container (5) holding one liquid product 

(3) and a second container (15) positioned within the 
first container and holding the other liquid product 

(2), a pump assembly (18) being adapted to feed out 
convenient units of the two liquid products (2, 3) from 

their respective containers (5, 15) simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dispenser for dispensing
convenient units of two liquid products (see e.g. DE-A-4 113 825).
The dispenser
is preferably intended for manually handling and manually
feeding out viscous products such as mustard and
ketchup or similar sauces on food products such as
hamburger bread rolls or the like.Hamburgers are usually served with mustard and ketchup
which are dispensed separately on the hamburger bread
rolls from different containers. Such a dispensing
procedure takes a rather long time, which manifests
itself particularly when many hamburgers have to be
served in a short period of time. Besides, a rather 
comprehensive equipment is required to carry out said
dispensing procedure.The aim of the present invention is to improve a dispenser
of the above-mentioned type so that dispensing
time is reduced considerably and a dispenser of simple
and easy-to-clean design is obtained.According to the
invention, this is accomplished by providing a dispenser
that presents the features defined in claim 1.By reason of the fact that one container that holds one
of the two products to be dispensed is arranged within
the other container that holds the other of the two
products, there is realised a compact and readily
handled dispensing unit, and by causing the pump assembly
to feed out convenient units of the two products
simultaneously dispensing time is essentially reduced.The invention is elucidated more in detail in the
following with reference to the accompanying drawings
in which:
Figure 1 is a vertical section of a dispenser according
to the invention;Figure 2 is a vertical section of lower parts of the
dispenser shown in Figure 1 during a dispensing operation;Figure 3 is a vertical section of lower parts of the
dispenser shown in Figure 1 during a return stroke;Figure 4 is a plan view of the containers comprised in
the dispenser according to the invention; Figure 5 is a section of a sealing ring comprised in
the dispenser shown in Figure 1;Figure 6 is a view of an end portion of the dispenser
shown in Figure 1, in which portion discharge openings
are provided;Figure 7 is a diagrammatic view of a filling device.The dispenser 1 illustrated in the drawings is preferably
intended to feed out convenient units of mustard 2
and ketchup 3 on a hamburger bread roll 4. The dispenser
1 has a first container 5, preferably of transparent
material, which comprises an upper part 6 with
a handle 7, and a lid 8 mounted so as to permit being
swung about an axis 9 for opening of the first container
5.
