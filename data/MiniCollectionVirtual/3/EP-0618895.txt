<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aminonitrile by partially hydrogenating a nitrile compound with two or more nitrile groups in the presence of a catalyst which contains a metal from group 8 of the periodic system of the elements, the hydrogenation being carried out under water-free reaction conditions and the catalyst having been treated with an alkanolate. Preferably, the catalyst is a Raney nickel or Raney cobalt catalyst which has been pretreated with an alkali metal alkanolate or an earth alkali metal alkanolate such as sodium or potassium methanolate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of an aminonitrile by partially hydrogenating a 
nitrile compound with two or more nitrile groups in the 
presence of a catalyst which contains a metal from group 8 
of the periodic system of the elements. Such a process is known from F. Mares, J.E. Galle, 
S.E. Diamond and F.J. Regina, Journal of Catalysis 112, 
(1988), pp. 145-156, according to which publication an 
alkane dinitrile, such as α,ω-butane dinitrile 
(succinonitrile), is hydrogenated in the presence of a 
catalyst consisting of finely divided rhodium halogenide on 
a magnesium oxide carrier. The catalyst is pretreated with 
sodium hydroxide, yielding metallic rhodium on a magnesium 
oxide carrier. During the hydrogenation reaction NH3 is 
supplied in an excess relative to the dinitrile. In the 
hydrogenation of succinonitrile, at a reaction temperature 
of 100°C, a pressure of 50 atm (5 MPa) and a reaction time 
of 5.5 hours, a conversion of 89.4% and a selectivity to 
aminobutyronitrile of 87.3% is achieved. This corresponds to 
an aminobutyronitrile yield of 78%. Although this yield is 
high, a further increase in the yield is desirable. In 
addition to this, a large amount of undesirable by-product 
is formed (11.9% of the succinonitrile being converted into 
dimers and oligomers). The article also reports an ε-amino 
capronitrile yield of 66.6% from adiponitrile at 90% 
conversion. Dimers are formed in an amount of 2.7%. It is the object of the present invention to 
provide a process for the preparation of an aminonitrile by 
means of a simple method, at a high reaction velocity and  
 
with a high aminonitrile yield, in which the formation of 
undesirable byproducts is limited. The object of the present invention is achieved in 
that the hydrogenation is carried out under virtually water-free 
reaction conditions and the catalyst has been treated 
with an alkanolate. Surprisingly, it has been found that according to 
the present invention, aminonitrile yields in excess of 80% 
can be attained. Moreover, in the process of the invention 
there is no need to supply NH3 during the reaction. As 
byproduct virtually only oligoamine is formed, which can be 
worked up in the chemical industry, as opposed to dimers and 
oligomers, which are formed according to the process known 
from the art. The process according to the invention is suitable 
for the partial hydrogenation of any nitrile compound with 
two or more nitrile groups. Thus, for instance, α,ω-alkane dinitriles are 
suitable
