<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process for the 
preparation of a modified copolymer, more specifically it is 
directed to a modified copolymer as a pigment dispersant for an 
aqueous coating composition. Aqueous coating compositions are known and described for 
example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,794,147; 4,791,168; 4,518,724; and 
4,403,055. These aqueous coating compositions comprise a principal resin, 
optionally a crosslinker, pigments dispersed in a grind resin and 
other additives such as solvents control agents and fillers. Many pigments, especially organics, used in coating 
compositions for the automotive industry are hydrophobic. These 
pigments, when used in aqueous coating systems require the use of 
specialized grind resins with the additions of dispersing agents 
and solvents to overcome their incompatibility with water and poor 
ability to grind. Pigment pastes are usually prepared by dispersing a pigment in 
a grinding resin in the presence of plasticizers, wetting agents, 
surfactants or other ingredients in a ball mill, sand mill, cowles 
mill or continuous mill until the pigment has been reduced to the 
desired particle size and is wetted by the resin or dispersed in 
it. One disadvantage of pigment pastes is that they contain 
volatile organic compounds (VOC). Also, they often require a large 
amount of resin relative to pigment, and the resulting pigment  
 
pastes are not very concentrated. In addition, pastes made with 
conventional resins often do not have optimum color development. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
a process for the preparation of a pigment dispersant for an 
aqueous coating composition which does not need the use of volatile 
organic compounds and which provides stable aqueous pigment pastes 
or pigment dispersions. Another object is to increase the amount 
of pigments in the dispersion and simultaneously reduce the amount 
of resin. Yet another object of the invention is an aqueous 
coating composition comprising such pigment pastes or pigment 
dispersions. The objects of the present invention are achieved with a 
process for the preparation of a copolymer as a pigment dispersant 
for aqueous coating compositions comprising the steps of 
a) polymerizing 
i) an ethylenically unsaturated monomer containing an 
isocyanate group with ii) other ethylenically unsaturated monomers having no 
functional group capable of undergoing a reaction 
with said isocyanate group to form a copolymer with 
isocyanate groups and b) reacting stepwise or
