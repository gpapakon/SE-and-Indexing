<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connecting device for connecting a first profile part (1) to a second profile part (2) which runs transversely with respect to said first profile part and is supported, by an end side, against a longitudinal side of the first profile part (1). Provided on that longitudinal side of the first profile part (1) which is directed towards the second profile part is a first anchorage groove (3), which extends in the longitudinal direction and is intersected by a second anchorage groove (4) which is open on the end side and belongs to the second profile part (2). A first connecting part (18) may be arranged in the first anchorage groove (3), in doing so assuming an anchorage position. A second connecting part (23) is arranged in the second anchorage groove (4). By means of a clamping part (24), the two connecting parts (18, 23) can be connected to one another such that they are directed towards one another essentially in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the second anchorage groove (4), the second connecting part (23) being tilted in the second anchorage groove (4) and, in the tilted position then provided, being fixed on the second profile part (2) such that it is captive in the longitudinal direction (16) of the second anchorage groove (4), this resulting in tensile-force transmission.

Connecting device (17) for sections suitable for the
construction of structures such as tables, shelving, stands and

the like, for connecting a first section (1) to a second section
(2) extending at right angles thereto with an end face resting

on a longitudinal side of the first section (1), the longitudinal
side of the first section (1) facing the second section (2) being

provided with a first anchoring groove (3) extending in the
longitudinal direction, the slot-like lateral longitudinal opening

of which is met by the longitudinal axis of a second
anchoring groove provided on the second section (2) and open at

the end face which faces the first section (1), wherein the
connecting device (17) has a first connecting element (18) which,

adopting an anchored position, may be so located in the first
anchoring groove (3) that its removal from the first anchoring

groove (3) through the slot-like longitudinal opening (5) is
impossible, that the connecting element (17) has a second

connecting element (23) locatable in the second anchoring groove
(4), and that the connecting element (17) has a clamping element

(24) by means of which the two connecting elements (18, 23) may
be clamped together substantially aligned with one another in the

direction of the longitudinal axis (16) of the second anchoring
groove (4), wherein the second connecting element (23), while

suitably clamped by the clamping element (24), is tilted in the
second anchoring groove (4) and fixed immovably to the second

section (2) in the tilted position which then exists in the
longitudinal direction (16) of the second anchoring groove (4).
Connecting device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the first connecting element (18) is a sliding block. 
Connecting device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the clamping element (24) is a threaded element (34) in

screwed connection with at least one of the two connecting
elements (18, 23).
Connecting device according to claim 3, characterized in
that the threaded element is a screw (34), with a screw head (35)

resting on the second connecting element (23) and a threaded
section (38) working in conjunction with the thread (39) of the

first connecting element (18), wherein the screw head (35)
expediently has a contact section (48) for a tightening tool.
Connecting device according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the tiltable second connecting element (23)

has a through hole (33) for the passage of the clamping element
(24) and which in the tilted position extends essentially in the

longitudinal direction (16) of the second anchoring groove (4).
Connecting device according to any of claims claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the tiltable second connecting element (23)

can assume a release position in the second anchoring groove (4),
into which it may expediently be shifted in the longitudinal

direction (16) of the second anchoring groove (4) relative to the
latter.
Connecting device according to claim 6, characterized in
that, on tightening of the clamping element (24), the second

connecting element (23) is moved from the release position into
the tilted position. 
Connecting device according to claim 7 in conjunction with
claim 5, characterized in that the diameter of the through hole

(33) and of the clamping element (24) are so matched to one
another that the second connecting element (23) may be tilted

around an axis running at right-angles to the longitudinal axis
(16) relative to the clamping element (24), for movement between

the release position and the tilted position.
Connecting device according to any of claims 6 to 8,
characterized in that in the tilted position the second

connecting element (23) is arranged at a different angle of tilt
to that of the release position, relative to the longitudinal

axis (16) of the second anchoring groove (4) .
Connecting device according to any of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the second connecting element (23) has a

tilting section (25) which in the tilted position works in
conjunction with a surface section (26) of the second anchoring

groove (4) opposite the longitudinal opening (5) of the second
anchoring groove (4), and also has one or more support sections

(27) opposite the tilting section and resting in the tilted
position on a groove-side support surface (12) lying in the

second anchoring groove (4) next to the groove neck (7) and
facing the groove base.
Connecting device according to claim 10, characterized in
that there is provided in the area of the tilting section (25),

on that side of the second connecting element (23) opposite the
first connecting element (18), an inclined surface in particular

in the form of a sloping surface (42) and expediently running out
to an edge. 
Connecting device according to any of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that, at least in the tilted position, the

second connecting element (23) has a stabilizing section (44)
