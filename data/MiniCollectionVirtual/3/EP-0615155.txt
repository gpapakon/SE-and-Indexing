<ABSTRACT>
Method of reproduction of tridimensional images, static or moving, wherein the photograms, regardless of their amount, 
are positioned in a single film, the projection is carried out by groups of photograms which are projected through a single optical 

projection system, the optical path travelled by the rays coming from the central photogram of each of said groups is not fractionized 
by any lateral reflection, and the remainder of light rays coming from the rest of the photograms is subjected to as many lateral 

reflections as the number of the position thereof with respect to the central photogram, the photograms on the film which 
have an odd number of reflections being specularly inverted with respect to photograms occupying even positions and the central 

photogram.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the reproduction of three-dimensional static and/or 
moving images. A three-dimensional projector of small 
volume and low weight may thereby be produced, suitable 
for advertisements, slides, domestic usage, shop windows, 
conference rooms and other similar exhibition sites. Systems based on the angular differentiation of 
images require the capture, from separate sites, of a 
large number of images and the projection, from different 
locations, of the same number of images. In the United States Patent 1883290 by Ives, 
three systems of reproduction by projection are described 
which are valid for static or moving images. Of these three systems, that of back projection 
with a single projection objective is not suitable for 
three-dimensional reproduction based on the angular 
differentiation of images. By contrast, the two other front projection 
systems may be valid. In one of them as many projectors and films are 
used as images, in the other a single film is employed 
with a projector having as many objectives as images, the 
objectives being the same distance apart as would occur 
in the case of independent projectors. The disadvantage of both systems stems from the 
large volume occupied by the reproduction elements of the 
device, as well as from the enormous length of the film 
and of the projector(s) when the number of images is 
high. The Applicant has been granted Patent Application 
PCT/ES 90/00024 (WO-A-92/01241). In this Patent Application are described and 
claimed various aspects of the relevant optical systems 
for producing three-dimensional reproductions based on 
the angular differentiation of images. Claimed in  
 
particular is a process and the corresponding projector 
for reproducing three-dimensional images, in which a 
number of objectives equal to one third the number of 
images is used. Each objective projects three images. 
Each trio of images is located on a single film with a 
distance between trios which does not always correspond 
with the breadth of the trio. The stills projected by 
each objective are located on the film at various 
heights. The Applicant, in view of this background information 
and in a desire to obtain the maximum efficiency 
from his system for three-dimensional reproduction, 
especially in order to obtain a larger angle of vision, 
has developed a system in which a projector of modest 
volume is used having a very small number of objectives 
in relation to the number of images. Firstly, it has been

<CLAIMS>
A method of reproducing three-dimensional 
static or moving images from a film having groups of 

angularly differentiated photograms recorded thereon, 
comprising: 


providing plane specular surfaces (L1L1, L2L2) interposed 
in the optical path of light beams travelling 

from a plurality of projection objectives to an optical 
reproduction system (SOSO) in the form of a transparent 

screen, the projection objectives being adjusted with 
respect to the plane specular surfaces in a fashion 

that the central photogram of each group of photograms 
on the film is projected directly onto the optical 

projection system without any reflections; 
characterised
 in that 

the number of angularly differentiated photograms on 
the film forming a group is an odd number greater than 

three; 
the photograms are positioned on the film consecutively, 
one next to the other without an intermediate 

space and at the same height; 
each group of photograms is projected through an associated 
single projection objetive onto the optical 

projection system, wherein the central photogram of 
each group is projected in the customary manner without 

any reflections, the photograms of the group located 
at odd distances with respect to this central photogram 

are projected with an odd number of reflections and 
those photograms of the group located at even distances 

with respect to this central photogram are projected 
with an even number of reflections, so that the 

photograms projected with an odd number of reflections 
are specularly inverted with respect to the remainder  

 
of the projected photograms of the group, producing 

optically the effect as if the photograms were 
projected from distinct, separated sites.
