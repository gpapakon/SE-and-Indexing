Method for the isolation of recombinant core
streptavidin wherein host cells are transformed with

a DNA coding for a core streptavidin, the
transformed host cells are cultured under suitable

conditions, the DNA coding for the core streptavidin
is expressed and the recombinant core streptavidin

is isolated from the host cells or from the culture
medium, wherein a DNA coding for core streptavidin

is used comprising:

(a) the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID
NO. 1, or
(b) a nucleotide sequence corresponding to a
nucleotide sequence (a) falling within the

scope of the degeneracy of the genetic
code.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a
microbial host cell is used.
Method as claimed in claim 2, wherein a
prokaryotic host cell is used.
Method as claimed in claim 3, wherein E. coli
is used as a host cell.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a
eukaryotic host cell is used.
Method as claimed in claim 5, wherein yeast is
used as a host cell.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 6,
wherein the host cell is transformed with a 

recombinant plasmid which contains at least one copy
of the DNA coding for core streptavidin.
Method as claimed in claim 7, wherein a
recombinant plasmid with a multicopy replication

origin is used.
Method as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, wherein the DNA coding for core streptavidin

in the transformed host cell is placed under the
control of a regulatory promoter.
Method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the DNA
coding for the core streptavidin is expressed by

addition of an inductor for the regulatory promoter.
Method as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, wherein the recombinant core streptavidin is

isolated from the host cells in the form of
inclusion bodies which are subsequently solubilized

and reassembled to form soluble, biologically-active
core streptavidin.
Method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the
reassembled core streptavidin is purified by

chromatography.
Recombinant DNA, wherein it codes for a core
streptavidin and comprises


(a) the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ, ID,
No. 1 or
(b) a nucleotide sequence corresponding to a
nucleotide sequence (a) falling within the

scope of the degeneracy of the genetic
code.
Recombinant vector, wherein the vector contains
at least one copy of a DNA as claimed in claim 13.
Vector as claimed in claim 14, wherein the
vector is a plasmid.
Vector as claimed in claim 15, wherein the
vector has a multicopy origin of replication.
Vector as claimed in one of the claims 14 to
16, wherein the DNA coding for the core streptavidin

is under the control of a regulatory promoter.
Plasmid pSAM-core DSM 6720.
A host cell wherein the host cell is
transformed with a DNA as claimed in claim 13 or

with a vector as claimed in any of the claims 14 to
18.
Recombinant core streptavidin, wherein the
recombinant core streptavidin comprises


(a) the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID
No. 2 and /or
(b) the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID
No. 2 without the N-terminal Met residue.
Use of a recombinant core streptavidin as
claimed in claim 20 for diagnostic in vitro test

procedures and affinity chromatography.
