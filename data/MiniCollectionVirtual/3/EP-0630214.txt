<ABSTRACT>
A fixator including jaw elements (1) receiving anchoring pins (2) to be fastened in a predetermined angular position on either side of the fracture site. Each jaw (1) interacts with a body having a controlled angular mobility. The fixator includes at least two body (3) - jaw (1) assemblies and each jaw has a spherical head (1a) fitted into a recess (3c) in the body (3) where it is engaged by clamping and squeezing means (7, 8, 9, 10) which simultaneously fasten the jaw (1) adjustably in various spatial planes, and translationally lock a linking member (4) extending through the body (3) for coupling with another body (3) - jaw (1) assembly.
