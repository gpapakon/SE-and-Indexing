<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a soldering device comprising: a vessel (1) opened at the top for filling with solder; at least two solder towers (5, 6) placed in the vessel, each adapted for delivering a flow (8, 12) of solder on their upper side; and a transporting member (3) for carrying along the objects for soldering above the solder towers. In order to prevent, both in the case of soldering machines which operate in a normal atmosphere and those operating in an inert atmosphere, the solder flows falling back into the vessel forming splashes which collide with the underside of the printed circuit boards, the solder towers are adapted for generating jets directed toward each other, wherein the jets intersect before they make contact with the solder level prevalent in the vessel. According to a preferred embodiment the rear tower (6) in the direction of movement forms a jet of solder comprising a movement component counter to the movement of the objects for soldering and enclosing an acute angle with the object for soldering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soldering device
comprising:
a vessel opened at the top for filling with
solder;at least two solder towers placed in the vessel, -
each adapted for delivering a flow of solder on their upper
side; anda transporting member for carrying along the
objects for soldering above the solder towers,the solder towers being adapted for generating
flows of solder reaching each other at a level above the
solder level prevalent in the vessel.Such a soldering device is known from EP-A-0083680.The known soldering device comprises towers,
generating solder flows, which are completely supported by
the towers or by parts adhered to the towers.This means that the soldering properties of this
apparatus are limited, in that they are less suitable for
soldering chips.The soldering of chips requires the use of a so
called chip wave or solder jet, which leaves the tower
before contacting the object for soldering.These solder jets are known per say.The problem often arises with such soldering devices
that the solder flows falling back into the vessel cause
splashes of solder which can spatter so high that they make
contact with the underside of the objects for soldering such
as the printed circuit boards for soldering.This problem occurs particularly, although not
exclusively, in soldering machines, wherein the
soldering process takes place inside an atmosphere of inert
gas. These splashed solder droplets will make contact with
the underside of the plate where they form solder globules.
These globules adhere hardly or not at all to the other
solder so that there is a danger of them coming loose and
causing short-circuit. Although this problem occurs in the 
case of normal soldering machines placed in a normal
atmosphere, the problem arises to a greater extent in
soldering machines operating in an atmosphere substantially
excluding oxygen. The low-oxygen atmosphere probably
results in an increase of the surface tension, whereby
the formation of droplets and globules of solder is
stimulated.From DE-A-3612361 a similar apparatus is known, in
which the first solder wave is much thinner than the
second solder wave, but in which nevertheless there is no
question of a chip wave or jet wave. Further, this document
does not comprise a shield connected to the
solder tower adapted to generate the solder jet. The object of the present invention is to
avoid the above stated problems.This object is achieved in that at least one of the
solder flows is a solder jet leaving the tower before
contacting the
