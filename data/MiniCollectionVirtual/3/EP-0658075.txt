<ABSTRACT>
A method for the manufacture of printed circuit boards is provided 
comprising conditioning the board, activating with a catalytic metal, post-activating, 

stabilizing and etching the copper surfaces before the desired circuit is 

formed on the board. This process eliminates the need for a flash coating of 
copper in the through holes before the use of protective coatings such as imaging 

resists and soldermasks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the manufacture of printed circuit 
boards and, in particular to improving the method by eliminating the need for a 
first electroless flash metal plating of the through holes prior to the use of 
protective coatings such as plating resists and soldermasks. The metal plating of plastics and other nonconductive (dielectric) substrates 
is well-known in the art and the following description will be directed for 
convenience to plastics, especially epoxy, and the preparation of printed circuit 
boards. The preparation of printed circuit boards requires the plating of conductive 
metal layers, usually copper, onto the plastic substrate of the board. These boards 
vary in design and may have a copper layer on each surface of the epoxy (two-sided 
boards) or they can be multi-layer boards which have a plurality of inter-leaved 
parallel planar copper and epoxy layers. In both types, through-holes are 
drilled in the board and metal plated to facilitate connection between the circuits 
on the copper layers. There are basically two methods for preparing the boards, the 
"substracive" method and the "additive" method with many variations in the 
process steps being employed depending on the type board desired. Regardless 
of the methods used, however, the need exists to apply and remove protective 
films on the board during the process. For purposes of illustration the semi-additive method will be described 
although the invention is applicable to other methods of manufacture. 
Commencing with a commercially available copper clad laminate or multi-laminate 
made from, e.g, paper-epoxy or glass-epoxy material, a predesigned 
series of through-holes is formed in the board in any conventional manner, then 
preferably treated to desmear or etch the plastics prior to the metal plating. A 
swell and etch procedure is usually used to treat the board and in one process the 
board is first contacted with a solvent to swell the epoxy and enhance the effect of 
the subsequent oxidative, e.g., permanganate solution etching step. After etching, 
the board is water rinsed and then neutralized with a reductant to solubilize  
 
manganese residues by lowering their oxidation state. The reductant preferably 
contains an acid fluoride to dissolve glass fibers in the epoxy. Thereafter the board 
is immersed in a catalyst, such as a tin-palladium solution, which activates the 
surface of the epoxy for electroless copper plating. Following a water rinse, the 
laminate is immersed in an
