<ABSTRACT>
A combustion air inlet pipe for a water heater includes an inlet end 
(46) having a longitudinal axis, and a plate (82) in 

the combustion air inlet pipe adjacent the inlet 
end (46), which plate (82) extends outwardly of the 

inlet end (46) along the longitudinal axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to water heaters, and more particularly to
water heaters having a combustion chamber and an air inlet pipe
communicating with the combustion chamber.It is known to provide an air scoop at the inlet end of an air
inlet pipe to direct air into the inlet pipe. It is also known to provide a
directionally adjustable ventilated cover at the inlet end to prevent the
introduction of water or other unwanted debris into the inlet pipe.EP-A-0255919 discloses a water heater including an air inlet
pipe including an outlet end communicating with a combustion chamber
and an inlet end located outside of the building containing the water
heater. In use, air is drawn through the inlet pipe to the combustion
chamber.US-A-4016730 describes an arrangement in which the outer end
of a pipe is provided with a plate-like formation to reduce air flow across
the end of the pipe thus reducing the risk of air flow through the pipe in
the reverse direction.According to the present invention there is provided a water
heater comprising:
a tank defining a water chamber;a combustion chamber for heating water in said water chamber;a combustion air inlet pipe including an outlet end
communicating with said combustion chamber, and including an
inlet end; anda generally planar vertical plate connected to said inlet end of
said pipe, the plane of the plate extending perpendicularly to the plane
of an opening of the inlet end, said plate extending outwardly from and
extending across said inlet end so as to substantially prevent horizontal 
air flow completely past said inlet end; and characterized in that inlet
pipe comprises a main conduit, and wherein said inlet end is defined by
a downwardly extending elbow portion connected to said conduit.The plate preferably extends a short distance into the pipe and
divides the pipe into two longitudinally extending portions adjacent the
inlet end. The plate generally extends along the longitudinal axis of the
inlet end. The plate preferably also has a semicircular portion extending
out of the inlet end. A hemispherical screen conveniently covers the
inlet end of the pipe and the semicircular portion of the diverter plate.A principal advantage of the invention is the provision of a
water heater having an air inlet pipe diverter plate as described above. If
wind blows over the inlet end, the diverter plate substantially prevents
the creation of a vacuum or negative pressure that could prevent the flow
of fresh air to the combustion chamber.Other features of the invention will

<CLAIMS>
A water heater comprising:

a tank (18) defining a water chamber (22);
a combustion chamber (26) for heating water in said water
chamber (22);

the plane of an opening of the inlet end (46), said plate extending
outwardly from and extending across sa
id inlet end (46) so as to
substantially prevent horizontal air flow completely past said inlet end

(46); and in that inlet pipe (38) comprises a main conduit
(50), and wherein said inlet end (46) is defined by a downwardly

extending elbow portion (54) connected to said conduit (50).
A water heater as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that said
plate (82) extends into said pipe (38) and divides said inlet pipe (38) into

two longitudinally extending portions adjacent said inlet end (46).
A water heater as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized
in that said plate (82) includes a semi-circular portion (94) extending

outwardly of said inlet end (46).

inlet pipe (46) includes a hemispherical screen (118) covering said inlet 

end (46) and said plate (82), and wherein said screen (118) is
complementary with said semi-circular portion (94).
A water heater as claimed in Claim 4, characterized by a
cylindrical collar (126) connecting said screen (118) to said inlet end

(46).
A water heater as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said elbow portion (54) extends downwardly at a

45Â° angle with respect to horizontal.
