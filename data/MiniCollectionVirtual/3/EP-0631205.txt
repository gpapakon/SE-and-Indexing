<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically
conductive roll, such as a charging roll, a transfer roll
and a cleaning roll, for use in electrophotographic copying
machines, printers or the like, which conductive roll is
required to exhibit low hardness or high flexibility, and
electrical conductivity.An electrically conductive roll such as a charging
roll, a transfer roll and a cleaning roll to be used in
electrophotographic copying machines and printers is
generally required to exhibit low hardness or high
flexibility, and electrical conductivity. To meet this
requirement, there has been conventionally employed a
conductive roll as shown in the drawing, wherein a base
layer consisting of an electrically conductive elastic body
having low hardness and a predetermined thickness is formed
on the outer circumferential surface of a suitable center
shaft (metal core). On the outer surface of the base layer,
there are formed by coating the following layers in the
order of description: an electrode layer having a relatively
small thickness; a dielectric layer (resistance adjusting 
layer); and a protective layer. In the case of a charging
roll with a center shaft (10) having a diameter of about
6mm, for example, a base layer (12) which has a thickness of
about 3 mm is formed on the outer surface of the center
shaft (10). Then, on the outer surface of the base layer
(12), there are formed an electrode layer (14), a dielectric
layer (16), and a protective layer (18) in the order of
description which have a thickness of about 10µm, 160µm, and
10µm, respectively.A prior art roller is disclosed e.g. by EP-A-0 329 366.The base layer of the conventional conductive roll
as described above is formed of an electrically conductive
elastic material prepared by adding an electron-conductive
material such as a carbon black or metal powder, to an
elastic material (major component) such as EPDM (ethylene
propylene dien monomer), SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber), or
NR (natural rubber), so that the prepared mixture is
adjusted to have a volume resistivity of not more than 103
Ωcm. To the thus prepared mixture, there is further added a
relatively large amount of softener such as a process oil or
a liquid polymer, so that the mixture has a JIS A type
(Japanese Industrial Standards) hardness value (Hs) as low
as 30°. Thus, the material for the base layer prepared as
described above provides the conductive roll with low
hardness (high flexibility) and high electrical
conductivity.The electrode layer formed on the outer surface
