<ABSTRACT>
A presbyopia correction contact lens to be used in contact 
with a cornea of an eye of a wearer, the contact lens having 

a substantially circular central correction region (2, 24, 
27) and an annular outer correction region (4, 25, 26) which 

surrounds the central correction region, the central and 
outer correction regions providing one and the other of a 

near vision correction region and a distance vision 
correction region, respectively, wherein the central 

correction region (2, 24, 27) has a center (P) which is 
offset by a distance of 0.2mm-2.4mm from a geometric center 

(O) of the contact lens toward a side portion of the lens 
which side portion is to be located on the side of the nose 

of the wearer when the contact lens is used in contact with 
the cornea, and the central correction region has a diameter 

within a range of 0.8mm-3.5mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a
presbyopia correction contact lens having a near vision
correction region and a distance vision correction region,
and more particularly to such contact lens having concentric
correction areas of different correction powers.There have been proposed multi-focus contact
lenses for vision correction of a patient's eye having
weakened accommodation faculties such as presbyopia. Such
contact lens has a multiplicity of correction powers or a
continuously changing correction power.Such multi-focus contact lenses are divided into
two major types. The first type is adapted such that a near
vision correction region and a distance vision correction
region are alternatively used as needed by the lens wearer,
while the second type is adapted such that the near and
distance vision correction regions are simultaneously used
so that the desired distance from the wearer's eye is
selected by an action of the wearer's brain to observe an
object at that distance. Since the first type of lens 
requires sophisticated technology for processing the lens,
and since the alternative use of the different correction
regions for observation of the desired object is difficult,
the second or simultaneous vision type adapted to observe
the object through the two correction regions is currently
prevailing.Examples of the simultaneous vision type contact
lens are disclosed in GB-A-2086605, U.S. Pat. No. 4,636,049,
EP-A-201231 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,752,123. These publications
propose various types of presbyopia correction contact lens,
each of which has concentric near vision correction region
and distance vision correction region that have different
correction powers. However, these contact lenses are not
necessarily satisfactory in their functions of corrections
for both near and distance visions.To find out a mechanism responsible for the above
drawback encountered on such conventional presbyopia
correction contact lenses, the present inventors made
specimens of various types and experiments on patients'
eyes. Extensive study and analysis based on the experiments
revealed that most of the lens specimens were displaced or
shifted on the eyes toward the corresponding ear of the lens
wearer during use. It was also discovered that this tendency
of displacement of the contact lens arises from the
configuration of the cornea in general. Namely, the analysis
indicated that the cornea of the human eyes has a larger
curvature at a portion on the side of the ear than a portion 
on the side of the nose,

<CLAIMS>
A presbyopia correction contact lens to be used in
contact with a cornea (10) of an eye of a wearer, said

contact lens having a substantially circular central
correction region (2, 24, 27) and an annular outer

correction region (4, 25, 26) which surrounds said central
correction region, said central and outer correction

regions comprising one and the other of a near vision
correction region (24, 25) and a distance vision

correction region (26, 27), respectively, wherein said
central correction region (2, 24, 27) has a center (P)

which is offset by a distance (A) of 0.2mm-2.4mm from a
geometric center (O) of the contact lens in a direction

from said geometric center toward a side portion of the
