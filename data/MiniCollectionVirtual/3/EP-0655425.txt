an improved working tool and method for fabricating the 

article from an aluminum blank, the tool comprising a 
mechanically strong, abrasion-resistant body against which 

the aluminum blank is forced under pressure, the tool body 
comprising a whisker-reinforced, crystalline body 

consisting essentially of about 5-35 weight % of SiC 
whiskers and 65-95 weight % of a crystalline matrix. The 

predominant crystal phase in the crystalline matrix may be 
a CaO-Al₂O₃-SiO₂ crystal phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
Aluminum article, working tool and method for 
fabricating the article from an aluminum blank. Molten aluminum is cast or rolled into blank bodies 
such as slabs, sheets and tubular lengths. These are 
commonly referred to as ingots or billets. The blanks are 
then reworked to convert them into useful forms. The 
resulting products include such diverse items as food and 
beverage containers, electrical wire, and automotive parts. The reworking operation, in general, involves 
compressing an aluminum blank against a mechanically 
strong, abrasion-resistant surface. This surface may be 
the interior of an extrusion die in the case of aluminum 
beverage cans. Aluminum wire is produced by drawing a 
cylindrical blank through a wire die. Aluminum sheet or 
foil results from drawing blank sheet through rollers. Various ceramic materials, including Al₂O₃, Si₃N₄, SiC 
and WC, have heretofore been considered for use in aluminum 
reworking operations. Alumina, reinforced with SiC 
whiskers, has also been proposed. However, it proved to be 
unsatisfactory because of a problem with porosity. 
Tungsten carbide (WC) is currently used in commercial 
extrusion dies.  While the various ceramic materials are effective for 
the reworking purpose, they all leave room for improvement. 
In particular, they tend to produce a rough or matte 
surface on a reworked aluminum article. Also, some of the 
materials tend to wear relatively rapidly, thereby 
requiring frequent replacement. It is then a basic purpose of the present invention to 
provide an improved material for use in fabricating 
articles from aluminum blanks. A further purpose is to 
provide a fabricated aluminum article with an improved 
surface finish. One aspect of the invention resides in an improved 
working tool for fabricating an article from an aluminum 
blank, the tool comprising a mechanically strong, abrasion-resistant 
body having a surface against which the aluminum 
blank is forced under pressure, and the improvement being a 
tool comprising a whisker-reinforced, crystalline body 
consisting essentially of about 5-35 weight % of SiC 
whiskers and 65-95 weight % of a crystalline matrix, that 
is essentially non-reactive with the aluminum whereby the 
fabricated aluminum article has an improved surface finish. 
The predominant crystal phase in the crystalline matrix may 
be a CaO-Al₂O₃-SiO₂ crystal phase. The invention further resides in a method of 
fabricating an aluminum article from an aluminum blank 
which comprises forcing the aluminum blank under
