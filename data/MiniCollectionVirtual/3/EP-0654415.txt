<ABSTRACT>
The lid (2) of a sheet-metal container (1) for transporting and for storing liquids has a central filling aperture (3) which is enclosed by a nozzle (5) which is moulded out of the lid and is perpendicular to the lid surface (4). A ring (6) of plastic or metal with an external thread (7) is fitted onto the nozzle (5) and is pressed downwards against the lid surface (4) by the outwardly rolled upper edge (8) of the nozzle (5). The threaded ring (6) is secured against rotation on the nozzle (5) by positive-locking connections (not illustrated). Screwed onto the threaded ring (6) is a plastic closure lid (11), into which a disc-like insert (12) of special steel is pressed. Between the outer edge (13) of the lid insert (12) and an annular projection (14) thereof, an annular groove (15) is moulded into the insert to receive a sealing ring (16) with which the closure lid (11) is sealed off against the outwardly rolled upper edge (8) of the nozzle (5).
