<DESCRIPTION>
 PRODUCTION OF OLEFINSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a process for the production of olefins. More particularly, but not exclusively, it relates to a method for the production of pure tertiary olefins by the decomposition of alkyl tert-alkyl ethers in the presence of a new and improved catalyst based on an alkaline earth exchanged faujasite.Description of Related ArtOlefins, particularly tertiary olefins, may be commercially produced by the sulfuric acid extraction of such olefins from mixtures containing them obtained e.g. , by steam cracking of petroleum feeds. Since this method uses sulfuric acid of high concentration, the use of expensive materials in the fabrication of the extraction apparatus is essential. Also, dilution of the acid to promote olefin recovery and reconcentrating the acid prior to recycling are required and are expensive. In addition, this method is not always advantageous industrially because tertiary olefins are subject to side reactions such as polymerization, hydration and the like during extraction with concentrated sulfuric acid.It is also known that tertiary olefins may be prepared by reacting them selectively from such feeds with a 

primary alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to produce the corresponding alkyl tert-alkyl ethers. The tert-alkyl ethers are primarily formed, since the secondary olefins react very slowly and the primary olefins are completely inert. Such alkyl tert-alkyl ethers may then be easily separated and subsequently decomposed back to the tertiary olefins and the primary alcohol.For producing tertiary olefins from alkyl tert-alkyl ethers, there have been proposed methods using various catalysts: For example aluminum compounds supported on silica or other carriers (US-A-4,398,051) ; phosphoric acid on various supports (US-A-4,320,232) ; and metal containing weakly acidic components on a carrier of>20 M2/gm surface area (GB-A-1,173,128) . In addition, inferior results are disclosed as being obtained utilizing carriers alone in the decomposition of methyl tertiary butyl ether (US-A-4,398,051) and utilizing H2SO4 treated clay in the decomposition of t-alkyl ether alkanols (US-A-4,254,290) .One of the main disadvantages of such processes is that the disclosed catalysts do not have good catalyst life in that higher and higher temperatures, which eventually become limiting, are required to maintain high conversion of the alkyl tert-alkyl ethers. Additionally, larger amounts of the dialkyl ether by¬
