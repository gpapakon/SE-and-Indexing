<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to manufacture, as required, relatively small units using simple means from a keyboard consisting of an integral multiple key guide (3), a rubber-like mat having resetting domes for keys and a contact plane, design precautions are proposed which simplify, in particular splitting of the multiple guide. The precautions comprise the multiple guide being divided into segments, the segments being connected to one another by means of webs (17), and the webs having to be separated using tools.

<CLAIMS>
Keyboard having a plurality of guide components (2) 
in each of which there is movably mounted a key (1), 

and wherein the guide components are segments of an 
integral multiple-key-guiding arrangement (3), adjacent 

segments of which can be separated by dividing 
connecting bars (17), the keyboard also having a 

rubber-like mat (4) on which domes (5) are formed, e.g. 
for resetting actuated keys, and further having a 

contact level (8) which carries conductor tracks (10) 
and contact arrangements (18) which can each be 

switched by a key,
 
characterised in that
 
holders (16, 16', 16") for a parallel guide component 

are formed on the segments, and tangential holders 
(16') of adjacent segments are uniformly standardised 

and are correspondingly divided only along a 
predetermined dividing line (arrow T) and/or along a 

dividing line corresponding to those already separated. 
Keyboard according to claim 1, characterised in 
that selected connecting bars (17) are provided with 

bores (12) or pins, or both, which are used for 
assembly of the keyboard. 
Keyboard according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the rubber-like mat (4) is notched along 

possible dividing lines (arrow T) to facilitate 
division.
