Method for processing plastic waste, in which the 
plastic waste, filled into a container as a cohesive, porous 

bundle with a high water-absorption capacity is autoclaved in 
a steam atmosphere at about 150 to 220 °C, preferably 165 to 

190 °C, and by this melted, and at the end of the autoclave 
operation the bodies of molten plastic formed are at least 

partly dried and cooled by reboiling of the water contained 
in them. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
plastic waste of non-pure types is used. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
plastic waste of a pure type is used. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the plastic waste is first precrushed. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the plastic waste is essentially crushed into matting 

particles with a greatest possible length to width and 
thickness ratio. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that plastic waste with a moisture content 

up to about 30% is used. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that plastic waste with a specific gravity 

of about 150 to 600 kg/cm³ is used. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the plastic waste is compacted, in 

particular is compressed, into bundles.  
 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the plastic waste is bonded into 

bundles. 
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in that 
the plastic waste is bonded with an organic bonding 

agent. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that plastic waste in loose bulk is taken 

from holding containers and is then used, provided with a top 
load. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that plastic waste is formed into bundles 

in the shape of balls which, in certain cases, are held 
together and/or supported by lost or non-lost agents. 
Method according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that holding containers filled with pre-compacted plastic 

waste as a bundle are used, the holding containers making 
possible an adequate entry of steam to the plastic waste. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the plastic waste is formed into 

bundles in the form of stackable moulded bodies which, in a 
given case, are held together and/or supported by lost or 

non-lost agents. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the bundle is steam-rinsed before 

autoclaving. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that the bundle is evacuated before 

autoclaving.  
 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 16, 
characterized in that the bundle is autoclaved with a top 

load. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 17, 
characterized in that mechanisms which take up the bundle 

during autoclaving are fitted with a secondary release 

agent. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 18, 
characterized in that the plastic waste is melted by 

autoclaving into bodies with a specific gravity of about 500 
to 750 kg/m³, especially about 600 to 700 kg/m³. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 19, 
characterized in that the bodies formed during autoclaving 

are cut up from melted plastics into moulded bodies or 
crushed into granular or flour-like material. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 20, 
characterized in that the bodies formed during autoclaving 

are subjected to a coarse crushing to a bulk weight of about 
300 to 330 kg/m³. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 21, 
characterized in that the bodies formed during autoclaving 

are subjected to a pulverization into a bulk weight of about 
20 to 30 kg/m³.
