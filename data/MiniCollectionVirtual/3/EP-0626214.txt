<ABSTRACT>
A device and a method for its use for the removal of 
contaminants from a gas cylinder valve assembly (63). The 

valve assembly output is fed to the device which in turn 
has inlet (61) and outlet (66) connections to receive and to pass 

purge gas therethrough. The device is sized and 
positioned so that contaminants can be purged and a 

vacuum drawn from the gas cylinder valve assembly at the 
assembly location its
elf thus increasing the efficiency 
of contaminant removal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention involves a device and method
for its use in the removal of contaminants from a gas
cylinder valve assembly. Both vacuum and purge
techniques are employed at high efficiency.It has become increasingly important in a number of
various and diverse industries to have access to ultra
high purity process gas supply systems. For example, in
the semi-conductor industry, as integrated circuits or
similar components become smaller in size, in the micron
or submicron ranges, thin film etching processes require
gases of ultra high purity. Without a reliable reaction
environment for film making and etching, repeatable
results are not always achievable.Although there is ample supply of UHP gases, it is
common to experience the introduction of ambient
contaminants during cylinder change-out. As noted, these
contaminants and their reaction products with process
gases can significantly degrade the performance of any
UHP gas system.The problems discussed above are certainly well
known and appreciated. In fact, it is common practice to
purge ambient contaminants after cylinder change-out and
before opening the cylinder valve. In this regard,
reference is made to Fig. 1 which depicts three known
purging techniques, namely cross-purge, deep purge and
vacuum purge.Fig. 1(A) depicts a typical cross-purge
configuration whereby UHP gas cylinder 1 containing high
purity gas at high pressure is fed through control
valve/cylinder connection 2. Typically, gas travels
through a process line depicted by "pigtail" 6 for 
feeding a process gas through valve 5. Purging takes
place by closing valve 2 and applying the purge gas
through valve 3 which is exhausted through exhaust valve
4. Although this process provides for some contaminant
removal, too much "dead volume" is left in "pigtail" 6
and cylinder connection 2 to adequately remove sufficient
contamination.Fig. 1(B) depicts what is known as a deep purge
procedure whereby UHP gas cylinder 11 is functionally
attached to connector 12 which further embodies valve 13
for the introduction of purge gas through line 16 and
exhaust valve 14. Deep purge provides improved
contaminant removal in light of purge gas introduction
through valve 13 at connector 12. As such, deep purge
eliminates the "dead volume" in the "pigtail" and
particularly in the cylinder connection itself. By
maintaining process valve 15 in a closed condition,
purging is generally accomplished by several pressure
cycles, that is, by opening and closing exhaust valve 14,
line 16 can be pressurized and
