<ABSTRACT>
Hydrolytically stabilized phosphite 
compositions are provided. The compositions 

contain an organic phosphite ester antioxidant 
and a hindered piperidinyl light stabilizer. The 

hindered piperidinyl component is not only a 
light stabilizer but also functions to 

hydrolitically stabilize the organic phosphite 
antioxidant. The compositions are useful as 

stabilizer additives to polymeric compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organic
phosphite ester compositions, and more
particularly relates to organic phosphite ester
compositions hydrolytically stabilized by a
hindered piperidinyl light stabilizer.The purpose of stabilizers for polymers is to
prevent deterioration of the polymers during
processing at high temperatures, and also to
permit manufacture of products with increased
intrinsic quality because of the enhancement of
their resistance to thermal and light degradation
during use. In addition, because of the ability
of these products to withstand more rigorous
conditions, their versatility is increased and
new areas of application are thereby opened.An important class of polymer stabilizers are
the organic phosphites. They include, as a
specially useful group, the dialkylpentaerythritol
diphosphites and diarylpentaerythritol
diphosphites. They are used widely in the
stabilization of vinyl chloride polymers,
polyolefins and styrene polymers such as ABS.
The dialkylpentaerythritol diphosphites and
diarylpentaerythritol diphosphites have the
structural formula:
 
where each R is independently selected from
alkyl or aryl groups.Despite such wide usage, however, these types
of stabilizers have not been entirely
satisfactory, because of their own slight
hydrolytic instability on storage. They tend to
absorb moisture from a moist environment and
their effectiveness as stabilizers for polymers
seems to decline in direct proportion to the
amount of water absorbed.This disadvantage can be avoided by taking
care to store and transport the stabilizer only
in a dry atmosphere. Once incorporated in a
polymer composition, lesser problems are
presented apparently because of the essentially
anhydrous condition of such polymer compositions.Obviously, though, elimination or a least
amelioration of the problem is desirable. A
moisture-insensitive phosphite stabilizer will
preclude the many inconveniences and expense
associated with having to maintain an anhydrous
environment, prior to incorporation into polymer.U.S. Pat. No. 3,553,298 (Hodan) shows the
stabilization of phosphite esters broadly by
using any of several classes of amines including
triisopropanol amine. See column 2, line 24 and
Examples I-VI.M. C. Imaev, Zhurnal Obshchel Khim. 31, 1767-70
(1961) shows the stabilization of lower
trialkyl phosphites with organic and inorganic
bases. The organic bases shown include pyridine,
triethyl amine and dimethyl aniline.U.S. Pat. No. 2,114866 (Vaughn) shows the
stabilization of esters of inorganic esters

comprising;


(a) organic phosphite ester selected from the group
consisting of triphenyl phosphite, trilauryl

phosphite, trioctadecyl phosphite, diisodecyl
pentaerithtritol diphosphite and tristearyl

sorbitol triphosphite; and
(b) a hindered piperidinyl light stabilizer in an
amount sufficient to improve the hydrolytic

stability of the phosphite ester wherein said
phosphite ester is present at a level of from

80 weight percent to 99.9 weight percent based
on the total weight of the composition and said

hindered piperidinyl light stabilizer is
present at a level of from 0.1 weight percent

to 20 weight percent based on the total weight
of the composition.

piperidinyl light stabilizer is represented by the

formula:

hydrocarbon radicals, R'' is selected from hydrogen and

hydrocarbon radicals and X is selected from O and N.

said piperidinyl stabilizer is present at a level of from

0.1 weight percent to 5 weight percent based on the total
weight of the composition.

said phosphite is present at a level of from 99.99 weight

percent to 95 weight percent based on the total weight of

the composition.
