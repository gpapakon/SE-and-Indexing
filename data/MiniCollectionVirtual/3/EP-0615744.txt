<ABSTRACT>
A solid o/w-type cosmetic composition, a process for 
molding it, and a container used for aqueous-type solid 

cosmetics are disclosed. The cosmetic composition 
comprises (a) a water-soluble solidifying agent selected 

from agar and gelatin, (b) an oil component and (c) 
water, and optionally, (d) a powder. The composition has 

superior characteristics inherent in an o/w-type 
cosmetic, while providing excellent usability and 

portability. The molding process comprises applying a 
water-carrying sheet material to the surface of the 

composition before solidification and releasing it after 
solidification. The container for an aqueous-type solid 

cosmetic composition is characterized by having a water-absorbing 
material secured to a receptacle of the 

container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid oil-in-water 
type (o/w-type) cosmetic composition, and, more 
particularly, to a solid o/w-type cosmetic composition 
which imparts a fresh feel on use, exhibits good affinity 
to the skin, gives a natural make-up finish, possesses 
superior moisturizing properties, provides excellent ease 
of application, and is convenient to carry. Further, the 
present invention relates to a process for molding this 
o/w-type solid cosmetic composition. Water-in-oil type (w/o-type) cosmetic compositions 
are conventionally known as a solid cosmetic composition 
containing water. Although these solid w/o-type cosmetic 
compositions are excellent in treatment characteristics 
such as skin protection capability and softness, they 
lack in freshness. They are sticky and oily, and do not 
impart a satisfactory intimate feel to the skin. On the other hand, o/w-type cosmetic compositions 
are highly evaluated due to the fresh feel on use, 
intimate feel to the skin, and natural make-up finish.  
 However, because o/w-type cosmetic compositions are normally liquid or 
creamy, they must be stored in containers such as bottles or tubes, for 
which the openings must be tightly sealed with a cap or the like. Thus, they 
are inconvenient to use and to carry around. Development of a solid o/w-type cosmetic composition having excellent 
cosmetic characteristics inherent in the o/w-type and adaptable to filling 
into a container which is handy, portable and convenient to use has 
been therefore desired. FR-A-2 618 351 discloses transparent oil-in-water compositions 
comprising 50-80% of an oil component, 0,5-5% of a surfactant, 2-10% of a 
hydrocolloid, and optionally citric acid, wherein the difference in the refractive 
index between the aqueous phase and the oil phase is not more 
than 0.005. In view of this situation, the present inventors have undertaken extensive 
studies and found that a cosmetic composition obtained by solidifying 
a composition comprising a specific water-soluble solidifying agent, 
an oil component, water and a cosmetic powder possesses both the excellent 
cosmetic characteristics inherent in o/w-type cosmetics and superior 
usability and portability. The present inventors have further found that the usability can be 
improved if the cosmetic composition is molded so as to have a noncontinuous 
surface after solidification.  
 Accordingly, the present invention provides a solid o/w-type cosmetic 
composition comprising 
(a) a water-soluble solidifying agent
