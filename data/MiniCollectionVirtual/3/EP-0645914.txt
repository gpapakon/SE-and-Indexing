<ABSTRACT>
A telecommunication network node is proposed which 
provides a novel solution to the realignment of payload of an 

input datastream (IN) within an output datastream (OUT) after 
dismantling the former. 
The present network node thereto generates from the 
payload of the input datastream (IN) data units (MSCI) some 

of which include a time label (TL) indicative of the moment 
at which they are derived. These data units (MSCI) are stored 

in a buffer (BM) from which they are read at a varying rate 
determined to track the input datarate and constituting the 

output datarate. This tracking is achieved by using the time 
labels to calculate a node delay, i.e. the delay between the 

derivation and the reading of a data unit, and by changing 
the above rate as a function of this node delay in order to 

keep it within predetermined bounds. 
A particular embodiment of the present network node 
allows to cross-connect Synchronous Digital Hierarchy or SDH 

datastreams using an Asynchronous Transfer Mode or ATM switch 
(MPSR).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a telecommunication 
network node including input interface means generating 
successive data units from at least one input datastream 
synchronous with a receive clock signal, buffer means storing 
said data units and output interface means reading said data 
units from said buffer means thereby producing at least one 
output datastream synchronous with a transmit clock signal. Such a telecommunication network node is already 
known in the art, for instance from the book "Transmission 
networking: SONET and the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy" by 
M. Sexton et al., Artech House, 1992 and more particularly 
from section 7.3.1 "Adaptation between Section and HO Path 
Layers" thereof. The known node, depicted in detail in Figs. 
7.26 and 7.27, handles input and output datastreams according 
to the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH. The node discussed in the above section is chosen 
so as to highlight a basic requirement for a network node of 
the above type, namely the fact that after dismantling of the 
input datastream its payload, represented by the successive 
data units, needs to be realigned in an output frame format 
synchronous with the transmit clock signal. In the above known node this requirement is met by 
allowing the buffer means to absorb the effects of pointer 
justifications in the input datastream and of differences in 
phase and/or frequency between the transmit and receive clock 
signals. By reading out the buffer means at a rate varying as 
a consequence of the above effects these may be accounted for 
in the output datastream through pointer justifications. The 
known network node determines the required varying rate in 
function of the buffer means filling level represented by the 
difference between the values of read and write pointers to 
this buffer means. The output interface means thus checks at 
every pointer justification opportunity if the buffer filling 
level is too high or too low and if so temporarily increases  
 
or decreases the rate at which it reads the buffer means in 
order to make a positive or negative pointer justification 
respectively. A drawback of this known network node is that the 
filling level of the buffer means is not always a good 
measure of the effects which are to be translated in the 
mentioned varying rate. Indeed, if the successive data units 
experience a variable delay before being written in the 
buffer means, the latter variable delay accounts for most of 
the fluctuations in the buffer filling level and hence
