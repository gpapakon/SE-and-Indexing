<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ecologically excellent
processing composition for silver halide photographic
materials and a method for processing silver halide
photographic materials using such a processing composition.In general, silver halide black-and-white
(hereinafter abbreviated as B/W) light-sensitive materials
are processed in the order of exposure, B/W development,
fixing, and washing; silver halide color light-sensitive
materials are processed in the order of exposure,
color development, desilvering, washing, and stabilization;
and silver halide color reversal light-sensitive materials
are processed in the order of exposure, B/W development,
reversal processing, color development, desilvering, washing,
and stabilization.In color development, the exposed light-sensitive
silver halide grains are reduced to silver by a color
developing agent in a color developer, and the thus produced
oxidation product of the color developing agent reacts with a
coupler to form a dye. In the subsequent desilvering, the
developed silver is oxidized (bleached) to a silver salt by
an oxidizing agent (bleaching agent). The silver salt and 
unreacted silver halide are solubilized by a fixing agent and
removed from the photographic material (fixing). Bleaching
and fixing are carried out either individually or
simultaneously. For the details of these processing steps
and compositions used therein, refer to James, The Theory of
Photographic Process, 4th Ed., (1977), Research Disclosure
No. 17643, pp. 28-29 (Dec., 1978), ibid, No. 18716, p. 651,
left to right columns (Nov., 1979), and ibid, No. 307105, pp.
880-881 (Nov., 1989).In addition to the aforesaid basic processing steps,
various auxiliary steps, such as washing, stabilization,
hardening, and stopping, are conducted for assuring
photographic and physical qualities of a dye image or for
maintaining stability of processing.These processing steps are generally performed in an
automatic developing machine. Photographic processing today
is conducted in a variety of places from photofinishing
laboratories equipped with large-scaled automatic developing
machines to camera stores having a small-scaled automatic
developing machine which is called "mini-labo". Under such
circumstances, reduction in processing performance has given
rise to a problem.One of the causes of reduction in processing
performance resides in incorporation of metallic ions into a
processing solution. It is natural that various metallic
ions should enter a processing solution through various 
routes. For
