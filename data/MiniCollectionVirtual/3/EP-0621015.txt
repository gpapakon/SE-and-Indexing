<ABSTRACT>
The stent comprises a cylindrical wall (1) formed 
by meshed wires (2) and a covering layer (3) of elastic 

material extending on a portion of its length, with 
an outer surface (4), and totally embracing the wire 

mesh.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stent
as specified in the preamble of Claim 1. Such a stent is known
e.g. from DE-A-3918736.
This invention also relates to a method
for applying such a layer on a stent.The discontinuous walls of stents, such as for instance
the macroporous walls formed by a deformable wire
mesh allowing diametral retraction for introduction
of the stent into air or food pipes and expansion
therein for dilatation, or repair, or bridging of
said pipes, have the disadvantage that they permit
ingrowth of tumors and other rapid growth cells through
the wire mesh or discontinuous wall, with the resulting
risk of stent occlusion.For preventing ingrowth of a tumor through the stent,
the document EP-A-0481365 shows an endoprosthesis
made of a temperature controlled self-expandable metallic
wire structure which can be embedded in a silicon
material which results in a zig-zag or undulated pattern
that closely follows the pits and bosses forming the
relief of the lattice structure. Such a coating configuration
does not have enough physical strength in the
pits of the structure to prevent tumor cells ingrowth
through the stent. Furthermore, in case of degradation
of the coating inside the stent due, i.a., to cell
ingrowth, there is a risk of having flaps and the
like resulting from the damaged coating which could
occlude the vessel or migrate therethrough and cause
an occlusion at some other place.Also to prevent ingrowth of unwanted cells into the
stent, the document DE-A-3918736 describes an expandable 
metallic stent with either a dispersion of PTFE on
the wire mesh, or an inner PTFE tube heat adhered
or sewn to the stent, or inner and outer PTFE tubes
adhered to one another between the bosses of the wire
mesh or sewn pouch like to one another. The dispersion
of PTFE is not resilient and will result in an embedding
of the wire mesh, perhaps in a coating taking a zig-zag
pattern following the pits and bosses forming the
relief of the lattice structure, with the same disadvantages
as outlined hereabove, and with the added disadvantage
that the absence of flexibility of the PTFE coating
or embedding may strongly raise the risk of having
flaps inside the stent due to the degradation of the
coating or due to the damage occurring on the coating
during expansion of the stent. The first alternative
of an inner PTFE tube may experience the same drawbacks
and in case of a degradation of the inner tube, in
addition to the risk of having flaps from the inner
tube occluding the vessel there will be a risk of
migra

<CLAIMS>
A stent with a discontinuous expandable wall (1) comprising
on at least a portion of its length a continuous

covering layer (3) of elastic material being adhered to
the said portion of the discontinuous wall (1) of the

stent and being thereby intimately united with said wall
portion, said covering layer (3) having an outer surface

(4) surrounding the discontinuous wall (1), characterized
in that the continuous covering layer (3) of elastic

material is shaped into an outer cylindrical surface
(4) without irregularities that surrounds the discontinuous

wall at the outside and extends radially
within the said portion of the discontinuous wall (1)

and forms an inner surface following in a distance the
material parts of the discontinuous wall in places with

material parts and following the cylindrical outer surface
in places without material parts thereby forming an

inner surface with irregularities. 
A method for applying the covering layer of the
stent according to claim 1, characterized

by the steps of :

radially contracting the stent,
inserting at least a portion of the contracted stent
into a tube the inner surface of which has been previously

done over with a lifting medium,
allowing the stent to radially expand in the tube,
wetting the assembly tube plus stent with an elastomeric
polymerisable composition dissolved in a sufficient

amount of solvent to permit wet forming,
evaporating the solvent,
polymerising the elastomeric composition in the
tube, and
taking the layer covered portion of the stent out
of the tube.
A method according to claim 2, wherein said tube
is first wetted alone

with the elastomeric composition added with solvent, 
and wherein the solvent is evaporated before the step

of insertion of the stent into the tube.
