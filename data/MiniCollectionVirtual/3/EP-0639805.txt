<ABSTRACT>
In the method for controlling a robot (R) with respect to kinematic systems (D,V,T), the robot is considered to equate to the same order as a kinematic system. All kinematic systems are described by means of a transformation matrix between final and initial coordinate systems. Successive kinematic systems can be combined into kinematic chains, which refer to a common coordinate system (KW). With respect to a final coordinate system (KD) of a kinematic chain, a spatial path (V0,VI,V1) of the final coordinate system (KT) of a second kinematic chain can be defined. With the exception of one kinematic system, all the other are moved independently of each other, while the remaining kinematic system carries out the balancing movement for maintaining the desired path.

Method for the numerical control of multi-axis
kinematic systems (R,D,V,T,A) having the following

features:

1.1 each kinematic system has an end coordinate system
(KF,KB,KR,KT) and a start coordinate system (KR)

and can be written between them by means of a
time-variant transformation matrix (TFR, TD, TV,

TTF, TGA) at every clock instant of the numerical
control,
1.2 kinematic systems which lie in series can be
coupled to form a kinematic chain, whereby a

kinematic chain can be written by means of the
transformation matrix (TTW, TBW) from the end

coordinate system (KT, KB) to the start coordinate
system (KW) of this chain at every clock instant

of a numerical control, which chain is produced
from the mathematical linking of the

transformation matrices of the kinematic systems
of this chain which lie in series,
1.3 all kinematic chains relate to a common world
coordinate system (KW),
1.4 with regard to an end coordinate system (KB) of a
second kinematic chain an arbitrary spatial path

(VO,..VI,..V1) comprising position and orientation
is defined, which is started from the end

coordinate system (KT) of a first kinematic chain,
whereby the defined path and the first and second

kinematic chain together form a closed kinematic
chain,
1.5 apart from a kinematic system of this closed
kinematic chain, all others are moved

independently of each other, while the remaining
kinematic system, with the necessary number of

degrees of freedom, is moved in such a way that
the defined path of the end coordinate system of 

the first kinematic chain in relation to the end
coordinate system of the second kinematic chain is

maintained at each clock instant of the numerical
control.
Method according to claim 1, whereby

2.1 the first kinematic chain is formed from a multi-axis
robot (R) which can be written as kinematic

system at every clock instant of a numerical
control by means of a time-variant transformation

matrix (TFR) from the robot flange point (KF) to
the robot coordinate system (KR) lying at the

robot base point, whereby

2.1.1 the position and orientation of the robot
coordinate system (KR) with respect to the

world coordinate system (KW) can be written
by means of a time-invariant transformation

matrix (TRW),
2.1.2 a rigid tool is located on the robot flange,
the tool coordinate system (KT) of which,

lying at the point of tool engagement (TCP),
can be written in the robot flange coordinate

system (KF) by means of a time-invariant
transformation matrix (TTF),
2.1.3 the tool coordinate system (KT) forms the end
coordinate system of this first kinematic

chain,
2.2 the second kinematic chain is formed from a
single-axis or multi-axis kinematic system (D),

whereby

2.2.1 the kinematic system (D) is allocated a base
coordinate system (KB), which forms the end

coordinate system of this kinematic system
and of the second kinematic chain and which

can be written in the world coordinate system
by means of a time-variant transformation

matrix (TBW) at every clock instant of a 
numerical control,
2.2.2 the spatial path is defined as position and
orientation of the tool coordinate system in

the base coordinate system.
Method according to claim 2, whereby the tool
located at the robot flange is formed from a single-axis

or multi-axis kinematic system (T) and the
position and orientation of the tool coordinate system

(KT) in the robot flange coordinate system can be
written at every clock instant of the numerical control

by means of a time-variant transformation matrix (TTF).
Method according to claim 2 and 3, whereby the
robot is located on a single-axis or multi-axis

kinematic system (V) and the position and orientation
of the robot coordinate system (KR) in the world

coordinate system can be written at every clock instant
of the numerical control by means of a time-variant

transformation matrix (TRW).
Method according to one of the above claims,
whereby additional kinematic chains, each of which

comprises one or more kinematic systems (A), are
interconnected alternately in place of the second

kinematic chain into the closed kinematic chain,
whereby the path to be interpolated applies from the

tool coordinate system of the first kinematic chain to
the end coordinate sys
tem of the newly interconnected
second kinematic chain.
Method according to one of the above claims,
whereby the path to be interpolated is defined as

position and orientation of the end coordinate system
of the second kinematic chain in the end coordinate

system of the first kinematic chain.
