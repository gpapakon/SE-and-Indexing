<ABSTRACT>
An inspection camera (18) is supported on a vehicle (10) so as to be rotatable about a longitudinal axis (24) and pivotable about an axis (28) at right angles thereto, and in each case motor-driven. Angle-measuring transmitters are allocated to these drives. The measured values are fed to a microprocessor as variable. Evaluation electronics (32) calculate the respective sight-line length (L) of the camera from these variables together with two tube/device-specific constants. As a function of this sight-line length (L), the camera is automatically focused and the illumination is adapted in such a way that the illumination density remains constant. The separation between two target points on the pipe wall is determined by a computer subtraction of the two sight-line vectors to the two target points.

device (10), which comprises a camera head (14), which is 

pivotable about two axes (24, 26) lying at right angles 
to one another and whose pivoting movements are effected 

by remote-controllable motors and are measured by means 
of rotary angle pickups, whose measurement signals can be 

displayed on a monitor and evaluated, characterised in 
that the measurement signals of the rotary angle pickups 

are supplied to evaluating electronics (32, 46), which, 
following the input or measurement of pipe-specific 

constants, which are proportional to the pipe radius (R) 
and the pipe axial distance (D) of the camera lens (36),

lens (36) and-a sighting point on the pipe inner surface

drive thereof until the camera (18) is automatically 

focused on the sighting point; 
b) the intensity of illumination of a searchlight (20) of 
the inspection device (10) and/or the adjustment of an
