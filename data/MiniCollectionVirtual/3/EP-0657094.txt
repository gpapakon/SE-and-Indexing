<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for picking up and 
delivering a plug of substrate having a plant incorporated 

therein, wherein the plug is seized at least from the top side 
by means of a number of needles (4) and is taken from a tray or a 

like device by at least a vertical movement, and the plug can 
be delivered by moving the needles (4) out of the plug, with the 

needles (4) being stuck into the plug substantially vertically 
such that the plug can thereby be seized, whereupon the 

needles (4) are moved upward relative to the tray while taking 
along the plug from the tray, in such a manner that the 

needles (4) move substantially parallel to each other relative to 
the plug, and to an apparatus for using such method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for picking up and
delivering a plug of substrate having a plant incorporated
therein, wherein the plug is seized at least from the top side
by means of a number of needles and is taken from a tray or a
like device by at least a vertical movement, and the plug can
be delivered by moving the needles out of the plug. Such a
method is known from Dutch patent specification EP-A-0 197 976.During the transfer of plants, in particular during the
pricking out thereof, seedlings, closely spaced in an
advancing tray, together with the plug of substrate wherein
they are incorporated, such as for instance a ball of soil or
a tuft of mineral wool or Oasis, are taken from the advancing
tray and transferred into larger pots, for instance soil
blocks or different trays, with the plant being spaced more
widely apart so as to be able to properly develop into adult
plants. A well-known problem involved in this pricking out is
the reliable seizure of these delicate seedlings without
damaging the plants, while a sufficiently high transfer rate
should nevertheless be realized for economic reasons.In the known method, the seedlings are introduced, for
instance in trays, into an apparatus, wherein from the top
side at least two thin needles are obliquely stuck under the
seedling from the edge of a plug. Subsequently, the needles,
mounted on a movable frame, are simultaneously moved upward
vertically, so that the plug together with the seedling 
incorporated therein are removed from the tray and can be
transferred.The needles are thin and are obliquely stuck into the
plug, which prevents the needles from damaging the seedling.
Because seedlings are received in relatively small recesses,
and hence small, closely spaced plugs in a tray, the needles
and in particular the needle holders in the known method will
extend at least largely above the plugs adjacent to the plug
to be seized, especially if the plugs are simultaneously
seized by more than two symmetrically disposed needles.
Moreover, the position of the needles should be adjusted in
each case when trays of different sizes are used, to obtain a
proper seizing direction and insertion depth.Due to the fact that the seedlings in a tray are closely
spaced, the leaves of the seedlings will commonly reach at
least partly over the edge of adjacent plugs. As a
consequence, in the known method, when being stuck into the
plug to be seized, the needles will commonly be stuck through
the leaves of seedlings received in adjacent plugs. This at
least

plug (20).
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
at least three, and preferably four needles (4) are stuck

A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that before the needles (4) are stuck into the plug (20),

outside the reach of the needles (4).
A method according to claim 3, characterized in that
the plug (20) in the tray (12) is moved substantially in

horizontal direction (V) under the needles (4) that are
disposed substantially in vertical direction, with the plant

parts being moved against plant-flattening means (15) that
are arranged before the needles (4), viewed in the direction

(V) of movement of the tray (12).
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that before the needles (4) are moved 

upward, a tray retainer (14) is placed against the tray (12),
blocking at least a vertical movement of the tray (12) during

the upward movement of the needles (4).
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
