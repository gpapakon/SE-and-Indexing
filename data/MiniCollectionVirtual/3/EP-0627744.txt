<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of radiology and,
more specifically, to a film/screen radiological system
with improved image quality.Medical imaging by film/screen systems is widely
recognized as one of the most useful tools in medical
diagnostics. Early X-ray images obtained with intensifying
screens required considerable patient dose and provided
relatively poor image quality. In modern practice, patient
dose has decreased by several orders of magnitude and image
quality, in terms of the visibility of potentially useful
diagnostic information content, has increased
significantly. Still, the continued demand for higher
image quality and lower dose is evidenced by continuing
efforts to improve both films and intensifying screens.It is well known in the art that the penetrating power
of X-rays is roughly proportional to the beam energy. The
fraction of the X-ray energy absorbed by a material
decreases as the energy of the X-ray beam increases. As
the penetrating power of the X-ray beam is increased, the
difference in X-ray absorption between different materials
in the exposed subject matter decreases and thus the X-ray
contrast decreases. High energy exposures, e.g., 120 kvp,
can be utilized where larger differences in X-ray
absorption are present in the subject matter. This
typically occurs when materials of different densities are
present in the subject. One example is thoracic radiology,
where the ribs and the mediastinum have high X-ray
absorption and the lungs have a low X-ray absorption. In
instances where the subject matter does not have large
differences in X-ray absorption, low energy X-rays are used 
to enhance X-ray contrast. Low energy X-rays are typically
used for soft tissue radiographs, such as mammography.To increase the speed of the film/screen system,
radiographs are typically obtained with a system comprising
two screens with a film between them. The film comprises
photographic emulsions coated on both sides of a support
and is typically referred to in the art as "double
emulsion." A double emulsion system has been difficult to
employ for low energy X-ray systems. The screen closest to
the X-ray source absorbs a large portion of the X-radiation
and there is not a sufficient amount of radiation reaching
the furthest screen to generate an acceptable image.Because low energy X-rays are strongly absorbed by the
X-ray phosphors, soft tissue radiography, i.e. mammography,
generally utilizes single screens in combination with films
coated on one side of a support. Thus, the speed of the
