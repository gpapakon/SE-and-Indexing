<ABSTRACT>
A miniature, hybrid-mountable, accelerometer-based, 
physical activity sensor (50) for use with a rate-responsive 

implantable stimulation device is provided. 
The physical activity sensor (50) is constructed as a 

cantilever beam (52) having a film of a 
piezoelectric polymer adhered to each surface of an 

electrically conductive substrate. The 
piezoelectric films are highly resistant to 

fracturing during manufacture and in use, and they 
provide a strong output signal when stressed in response 

to bodily accelerations. A pair of electrically 
conductive supports (54,56) serve to anchor the physical 

activity sensor (50) to a substrate (76) and deliver the 
output signal provided by the sensor (50) to circuitry 

(110) within the rate-responsive implantable stimulation 
device. The physical activity sensor is adapted to be 

mounted directly to conductive traces (72,74) on a 
suitable substrate, such as an implantable stimulation 

device hybrid (76).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cardiac
stimulating devices and particularly to implantable
cardiac stimulating devices capable of providing rate-responsive
pacing therapy. More particularly, this
invention is directed toward a miniature,
accelerometer-based, physical activity sensor
particularly adapted to be mounted within such
devices, for measuring levels to which a patient is
engaged in physical activity, so that rate-responsive
pacing therapy may be administered accordingly.A pacemaker is a type of implantable medical
device which delivers electrical stimulation pulses to
cardiac tissue to relieve symptoms associated with
bradycardia -- a condition in which a patient cannot
normally maintain a physiologically acceptable heart
rate. Early pacemakers delivered stimulation pulses
at regular intervals in order to maintain a
predetermined heart rate, which was typically set at a
rate deemed to be appropriate for the patient at rest.
The predetermined rate was usually set at the time the
pacemaker was implanted, and in more advanced
pacemakers, could be set remotely after implantation.Early advances in pacemaker technology
included the ability to sense intrinsic cardiac
activity of a patient (i.e., the intercardiac
electrogram, or "IEGM"), which led to the development
of "demand pacemakers," so named because stimulation
pulses were provided only as needed by the heart.
Demand pacemakers are capable of detecting a 
spontaneous, hemodynamically effective, cardiac
contraction which occurs within a predetermined time
period (commonly referred to as the "escape interval")
following a preceding contraction. When a naturally
occurring contraction is detected within the escape
interval, a demand pacemaker does not deliver a pacing
pulse. The ability of demand pacemakers to avoid
delivery of unnecessary stimulation pulses is
desirable, because it extends battery life.Early demand pacemakers enabled a physician
to adjust the heart rate to be maintained by
telemetrically adjusting the length of the escape
interval. However, this flexibility only allowed for
adjustments to a fixed "programmed rate," and did not
accommodate patients who required increased or
decreased heart rates to meet changing physiological
requirements during periods of elevated or reduced
physical activity. Therefore, unlike a person with a
properly functioning heart, these patients were paced
so that a constant heart rate was maintained
regardless of the level to which the patient was
engaged in physical activity. Thus, during periods of
elevated
