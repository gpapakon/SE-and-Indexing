<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper sizing process using a starch-containing
composition in which each starch molecule is substituted by a cationic
group and an n-alkenylsuccinyl group wherein the n-alkenylsuccinyl group contains 5 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkenyl chain.EP-A-350 668 describes and claims a starch composition which is a physical
mixture of 10-70% (by weight) of a cationic starch and 30 to 90% (by weight) of an ASA-treated
starch, said ASA-treated starch being a monoester of an alkenyl succinate. In the context of the
patent "ASA" stands for "alkenylsuccinic anhydride". The starch mixture of EP-A-350 668 is said to
be of particular utility as an external size for paper or paperboard when applied as an aqueous
dispersion having a solids content of about 2 to about 20% by weight.The starch blends described in EP-A-350 668 are prepared by the physical admixture of a
cationic starch and an ASA-treated starch and the resulting mixture is therefore made up of starch
molecules substituted by a single essential substituent. We have found however that although an
effective size the compositions of EP-A 350 668 have a significant disadvantage in service because
starch is lost when the paper is repulped and recycled. We have also found however that this
disadvantage may be overcome if, instead of a mixture of two starches each substituted by single
essential substituent, a doubly substituted starch is used as the basis of the sizing composition in
which the starch contains both essential substituents in the same molecule. The new composition
may be used as an internal as well as an external size in paper and paperboard processing.U.S.-A-4 626 288 contains a description of a product which is made by reacting a
cationised starch ether with tetradecenylsuccinic anhydride. The product is not however suggested
as a sizing agent but as a product giving a high temperature gel with a strong gel structure of
particular utility in food preparations.According to the present invention therefore a process for the sizing of a paper composition
is characterised by incorporating in, or applying to the paper a starch composition in which the
starch molecules in the composition are substituted by both cationic and n-alkenylsuccinyl groups, wherein the n-alkenylsuccinyl group contains 5 to 20
carbon atoms in the alkenyl chain.The sizing process may be carried out under conditions which are conventional for the
application of starch-based sizes to paper and paperboard. Thus, the starch composition may be
