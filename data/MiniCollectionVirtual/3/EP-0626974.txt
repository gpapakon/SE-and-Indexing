<CLAIMS>
Mitogen-free substance using guluronic acid or 
mannuronic acid, characterised by copolymers consisting of 

10 to 90 mol% of guluronic acid and, supplementing each to 
100%, of mannuronic acid, and the copolymers having a 

molecular weight of 10,000 to 500,000 dalton. 
The substance in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised by biocompatibility. 
The mitogen-free substance in accordance with Claim 
1, characterised by an electrophoretic mobility of the 

copolymers of 3 to 5 . 10

. 
A process for the preparation of the mitogen-free 
substance in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that an up to 10% alginate solution is 
separated into different fractions by carrier-free 

electrophoresis and subsequently, the fraction with an 
electrophoretic mobility of 3 to 5 . 10

 is 
dialyzed in order to separate molecules with a weight of 

10,000 to 500,000 dalton. 
A process for the preparation of a mitogen-free 
substance in accordance with one of Claims 1-3 characterised 

in that the alginate solution is precipitated into an 
insoluble complex by adding barium or multivalent cations 

(e.g. lead Pb, copper Cu), which have a similar or higher 
affinity for the alginate than barium; followed by an 

extraction with an acid, such as acetic acid, for several 

hours at increased temperatures; after washing, another 
extraction is conducted over several hours in an alkaline 

range using a complexing agent, such as citric acid; after 
further washing in distilled water, a treatment with an  

 
alcohol, such as ethanol, is conducted over several hours and 

finally the alginates are released by addition of EDTA 
(ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) in a highly alkaline 

range. 
Mitogen-free substance in accordance with one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it is used as an 

implant, preferably in the form of capsules containing living 
cells, in transplant surgery. 
Mitogen-free substance in accordance with one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it is used as a 

stabilizing and gelling additive for foods. 
Mitogen-free substance in accordance with one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it is used as a wound 

closure for external and/or internal wounds and/or as a 
dental impression compound and/or, in the form of capsules 

or pellets, as a vehicle for pharmaceuticals or contrast 
media.
