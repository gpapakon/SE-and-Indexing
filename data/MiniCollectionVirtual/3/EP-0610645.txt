<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of determining the 
distribution of marginal traffic capacity of given cells in a 

radio cell system comprising base stations with associated 
coverage areas and radio stations within the coverage areas 

of the cell. Compatibility calculations are performed for 
each element or a selective selection of elements of an 

exclusion matrix. The channels are redistributed in this way 
iteratively in dependence of the time dependent traffic need 

in each cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method in a mobile
radio system using a technical means, preferably a computer,
for determining, for a given channel plan, the distribution
of marginal traffic capacity of given base stations
corresponding to cells,
within the coverage area of which a number of
mobile radio stations exist, said radio stations being
movable from the coverage area of cell to the coverage area
of another cell, the mobile radio system being provided with a
number of channels.The term cell refers to the solid angle irradiated by
a specific antenna system and providing coverage according to
given coverage limit values. Thus, a base station can sustain
a plurality of cells having various antenna diagrams,
bearings and effective transmitted power. The invention is
used in radio cell systems in which a control unit for
channel allocation is provided in each cell. According to the
invention a method of indicating, in dependence of the
traffic need and a primary given channel plan, at which cells
in an existing mobile radio system it is possible to change
the capacity by adding more channels per cell at the same
time as the number of channels per cell is reduced in other
cells.The mobile radio systems in various countries are
growing rapidly, especially in large urban areas, and new
methods are developed to achieve traffic handling with an
efficient utilization of radio frequency aspects. In many
places of the world computer programs are beginning to be
used to perform channel allocation. These programs utilize
information about which cells that can not share a channel
with, or have a neighbouring channel with, any other cell,
said information being described by a so-called exclusion
matrix. The solutions obtained so far represent stationary
solutions in which the channels once and for all are fixed
for fixed base stations or cells. However, there is a need to  
redistribute the channels for different cells in dependence
of the traffic need in the course of the day. The method proposed
by the invention is useful if an exlusion matrix for
every cell in the radio system is available and a channel
plan of the cells in the system. The channel plan satisfies a
stationary partial need of capacity in the system. The method
results in the possibility of redistributing the capacity in
the various cells of the mobile radio system.The following documents deal with similar methods.The document WO90/10341 relates to a method for resource
allocation in a radio system comprising base stations

Method in a mobile radio system using a technical
means, preferably a computer, for determining, for a given

channel plan, the distribution of marginal traffic capacity
of given base stations

corresponding to cells, within the coverage area of which a
number of mobile radio stations exist, said radio

stations being movable from the coverage area of cell to the
coverage area of another cell, the mobile radio system being provided

with a number of channels, 
characterized
 in that compatibility
calculations are performed by said technical

means for each element or for a selection of elements of an
exclusion matrix with respect to all or a selection of the

channels in a given channel allocation in such a manner that
a marginal list is generated by said technical means for

alternative channels for each cell within the base stations,
whereby a distribution of maximal traffic capacity for the

cell in terms of the number of realizable channels per cell
is calculated by means of said technical means by selecting

cells with alternative, not mutually excluding possible
channels in accordance with a given order of priority, by

examining alternative possible channels according to said
marginal list in a further order of priority, and by adding

one of possible channels to the cell, resulting in a new
channel plan and exclusion matrix, which creates the basis

of a new marginal list, which marginal list is used for distribution
of traffic capacity with respect to the traffic

need varying in time in each cell.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
the cells are prioritized in dependence of the prevailing

traffic need in time periods having variable duration.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that the traffic capacity of the mobile radio
system is optimized by examining alternative possible

channels according to the marginal lists for a given initial
channel allocation, or alternatively the prevailing channel

allocation, and selecting a cell having alternative non-excluding
channels according to an order of priority, adding a

channel to the cell, as well as subtracting the corresponding
channel, if necessary, from another cell where it 

is not needed at the moment, generating a new channel plan
and exclusion matrix, which create the basis of a new marginal

list, iterating this procedure until no alternative
channel can be found in the marginal list and hence no

further channel can be added or redistributed in the system,
or the remaining cells are uninteresting with respect to

their low priority according to the order of priority.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that a control of the mobile radio system is achieved by
means of centrally provided technical means, e.g. a computer.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that centrally provided technical means
continously receive information about the traffic need from

the base stations from which new orders of priority are
calculated.
