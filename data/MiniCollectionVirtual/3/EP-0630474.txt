<CLAIMS>
A housing (5) for gas sensors, preferably a lambda
probe for determining the quota of harmful substances and/or

oxygen in the exhaust gas of preferably internal combustion
engines, with an outer protective housing (6), at one end

(15) of which electrical connections (7) are arranged for
the sensor elements arranged on a small plate (8) and at the

other end (14) of which the sensor elements are arranged
under a perforated protective cover (9) to be exposed to the

gas stream which is to be measured, and with a ceramic
shaped part (10) arranged in the protective housing (6), in

which shaped part (10) contact elements are provided which
connect in an electrically conducting manner the connections

(7) with the contact faces for the small plate (8),

characterised in that

the ceramic shaped part (10) is divided parallel to the axis
of the housing and hence consists of two part pieces (11),
the two part pieces (11) have at their one end (15) slits
(12) open on one side, and depressions (16),
contact elements (13), projecting over the open - fourth-side,
held immovably by three sides of the slit (12), are

inserted into these two part pieces (11),
the two part pieces (11) have the depression (16), extending
up to their other end (14) and adapted to the shape of the

small plate (8), for bearing and receiving the small plate,
at least the projecting regions of the contact elements (13)
of the two part pieces lie opposite each other and are

arranged in the region of the depression (16) and both hold
the small plate (8) in a clamping manner and also at the

same time connect in an electrically conducting manner the
sensor element situated thereon, 
the contact elements (13) are able to be provided with the
electrical connections (7) on their end facing the

connections,
each of the two part pieces (11) has a joint face which both
receive between them in mounted state the small plate (8)

and the contact elements (13),
the contact element (13) has a rearward connection region
(30) and a contact region (27) adjoining thereto.
The housing according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the protective housing (6) is constructed as a casing of a

material which is stable with regard to temperature.
The housing according to Claim 2, characterised in that
the material which is stable with regard to temperature is

metal.
The housing according to one of Claims 1 or 3,
characterised in that the ceramic shaped part (10) consists

of two part pieces (11) which are similar or identical in
their joining region.
The housing according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that each part piece (11) has guiding- and

holding noses (18) for the small plate and also for holding
the part pieces (11) to each other.
The housing according to Claim 5, characterised in that
the guide noses (18) of the one part piece (11) engage into

corresponding guide holes (19) of the other part piece - in
the mounted state -.
The housing according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the two part pieces (11) are held by 

means of a holding ring (43).
The housing according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the holding ring is constructed as a spring ring, slitted

casing or shrunk-on casing.
The housing according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the housing has a tapped bush (21)

provided with a thread (20) for the gas sensor and serves to
receive the protective cover (8).
The housing according to Claim 9, characterised in that
the protective housing (6) is secured on the tapped bush

(21).
The housing according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the contact region (27) has an actual projection (27)

projecting over the open - fourth - side of the slits (12)
and in this region the contact region is constructed so as

to be resiliently flexible.
The housing according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the contact region (27) is constructed

so as to be resiliently flexible.
The housing according to one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that the slit (12) has at least one

projection (30) of the part piece (11) on its base for the
immovable securing of the contact element (13) with either

a punched-out section (29) provided thereon or with a
bracket.
The housing according to one of Claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that the part piece (11) has at its other

end a cone which is connected therewith in one piece or is
separate and connectable therewith, which is able to be

brought to lie in a sealing manner against the conical inner 
face of the tapped bush (21) adapted thereto.
The housing according to Claim 14, characterised in
that the cone has depressions at its two ends in the region

of the emergence of the small plate (8) which is to be
received.
The housing according to Claim 15, characterised in
that the depressions are constructed in a funnel shape.
The housing according to one of Claims 1 to 16,
characterised in that the two part pieces (11) and the cone

are held by means of the holding ring.
