<ABSTRACT>
A traffic control system comprising video cameras, 
being positioned above or along a traffic roadway for monitoring 

a predetermined road or lane segment, is provided 
with means for continuously recording road images and with 

selection means for selectively recording images when a 
vehicle is within sight. 
The road segment to be monitored is provided with a 
cross strip, contrasting clearly with the road surface 

within the viewing sight of the camera(s), and the video 
cameras are connected to a processor capable of distinguishing 

this cross strip even when a shadow or light from the 
headlights of a vehicle is incident on it. A blocking function 

blocks the selection means when the cross strip is 
distinguishable, and releases them only when the cross 

strip, for at least across a section of its length, is 
indistinguishable. In this manner it is ensured the only 

images recorded are of an actual vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a traffic control system 
comprising one or several video cameras, being positioned 
above or along a traffic roadway for monitoring a predetermined 
road or lane segment, and provided with means for 
continuously recording road images, and selection means for 
selectively recording images, when a vehicle is within 
sight. Such systems are known and are widely used for monitoring 
traffic lights, enforcement of speed regulations on 
highways and such. The video camera(s) is/are directed on 
the road section to be monitored; in the case of multiple 
cameras the recording angles of adjacent cameras overlap 
partly, and record images of the road e.g. 5 to 50 times per 
second. In this an image is to be registered and stored for 
further processing only when a vehicle is properly within 
sight. However, such a video camera system has a problem with 
respect to shadow effects. When a video camera system monitors 
a road section with the sun low on the horizon or 
during darkness, during which the headlights of vehicles are 
lit, then shadows cast forward or light emanating from the 
headlights cause selective registration of an image at an 
instance when the vehicle itself is not within camera range. 
Under certain circumstances particularly during heavy 
traffic on a roadway which is being monitored, this can lead 
to many faulty recordings nevertheless being registered, 
thereby substantially increasing the costs of using such a 
system, while moreover there is a probability that the 
vehicle in violation will not be registered due to such an 
early recording. The purpose of the invention is to eliminate this 
objection and to provide a traffic control system which 
records images of vehicles only when there indeed is the 
case of such a vehicle. To that end the invention provides a traffic control 
system, as described in the preamble, characterized in that 
the road or track segment to be monitored is provided with  
 
at least one cross strip, contrasting clearly with the road 
surface within the viewing sight of the camera(s), and in 
that the video cameras are connected to a processor capable 
of distinguishing this cross strip even when a shadow or 
light from the headlights of a vehicle is incident on it, 
and being provided with a blocking function, which blocks 
the selection means when the cross strip is distinguishable, 
and enables them only when the cross strip, at least across 
a section of its length, is indistinguishable. Essential to the invention is that unless

patterns. 
Traffic control system according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the contrasting patterns consist of white or 

coloured elements such as stripes, arrows, diamond shapes, 
blocks and stones. 
Traffic control system according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the contrasting patterns consist of lightemitting 

elements. 
Traffic control system according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the light-emitting elements are reflectors. 
Traffic control system according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the light-emitting elements are bulbs. 
Traffic control system according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the light-emitting elements are light-emitting 

diodes (LED's). 
Traffic control system according to any of the foregoing 
Claims, characterized in that that the road or lane 

section to be monitored is provided with contrasting cross 
strips both near its beginning as well at the end thereof.
