<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for testing the stability and bending strength of poles (1) which are anchored upright, in which in each case the pole to be tested is subjected to a variable bending moment, as well as of a device for carrying out the method. The device comprises a force unit (2), which with an increasing force (F) can be introduced into the pole (1) above its anchorage and the pole can be loaded with a bending moment, as well as a force sensor (4) to measure this force, whose level and variation can be evaluated to determine the stability of the pole. In this arrangement, provision is made of a distance sensor (5), which can be brought into contact against the pole above the pole anchorage, to measure the lateral deflection (S) of the pole occurring because of the bending moment, and the measured values generated by the force and distance sensor can be simultaneously processed in an evaluation circuit (6.1, 6.2) and can be displayed with reference to their mutual dependence. A linear variation of this dependence up to a desired testing force shows in this arrangement that the pole (1) and its anchorage are in order. If, before reaching the desired testing load, a transition of the relationship between loading and deflection value from a linear into a non-linear variation is indicated, a plastic deformation of the tested pole is present, that is to say a pole is present which is damaged.

A method for testing the attachment and bending strength of upright
anchored poles (1) in which the pole to be tested in each case is subjected to a

variable bending moment in that it is loaded by a force introduced above its anchoring
and increasing during the course of the testing procedure and whose

measured value and course is used for determining the strength of the pole, characterised
in that the mentioned force (F) as well as also the distance (S) about which

the pole is laterally deflected at a selected location due to the bending moment are
simultaneously measured with sensors (4, 5), that a linear dependence of the

mentioned distance on the introduced force is evaluated as an indication for the
pole deflection lying in the region of the elastic deformation, whilst the determining

of a non-linear dependence of the values measured by the sensors is evaluated
as an indication for a plastic deformation and/or for a non-stable anchoring of the

pole (1) which is then recognised as not having bending strength or attachment
strength and the testing procedure is stopped by unloading the pole (1), and that

otherwise the testing procedure is only then stopped by unloading the pole when
a predetermined nominal value of the bending moment in the elastic region of the

deformation of the pole (1), which is recognised as having adequate attachment
and bending strength, is reached.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the testing procedure
is carried out several times, wherein the forces (F) directed onto the pole (1) are

introduced after one another from different directions.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the testing procedure
is automatically interrupted on reaching the predetermined nominal value of 

the bending moment, or with non-linear dependence of the defelection on the
introduced force.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the force
(F) effecting the pole deflection (S) is produced hydraulically.
A device for testing the attachment and bending strength of upright anchored

of a force unit (2), with which an increasing force (F) can be introduced into the

circuit (6.1, 6.2) that the readings produced by them may be continuously fed to the
evaluation circuit (6.1, 6.2), and that
the evaluation circuit (6.1, 6.2) is designed such that with it in operation, the
readings produced by the force and distance sensors (4 or 5) can be simultaneously

processed in it and with regard to their mutual dependence, can be optically represented
and where appropriate documented.
