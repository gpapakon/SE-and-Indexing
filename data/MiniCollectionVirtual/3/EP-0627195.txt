<ABSTRACT>
A metabolic rate analyzer comprises a CO₂ detector 
(30), an O₂ detector (31), a flow resistance (38), a 

differential pressure transducer (40), a solenoid-actuated 
metering valve (33) for producing a 

volumetrically-proportional sample of respired gas, a 
vacuum regulator (34) for receiving the sample, a pump 

(35) for drawing the sample from the vacuum regulator, 
and a processor (36) for periodically sampling the 

differential pressure signal to provide a flow signal, to 
modulate power applied to the solenoid-actuated metering 

valve (33), and to provide a measure of the total volume 
of respired gas. The processor correlates the total 

volume of respired gas, O₂ content and CO₂ content to 
provide a measure of metabolic rate. Flow is recycled 

between the pump (35) and the regulator (34) to provide 
a source of mixed respired gas for analysis and digital 

integration of the flow signal provides a measure of the 
total volume of respired gas. A pulse generator driven 

by the microprocessor (36) varies the frequency of pulses 
applied to the metering valve and the pulse width to 

provide volumetrically-proportional sampling and to 
control the effective sample volume of the analyzer, 

respectively. The processor determines the slope of the 
flow signal and increases the periodic sample rate of the 

pressure signal when slope is increasing and decreases he 
periodic sample rate when slop is decreasing to provide 

derivative augmentation of the sample period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the art of gas
analysis and, more particularly, is directed to metabolic
rate analyzers.All of the processes that take place in the body
ultimately result in the production of heat. Heat
production and metabolism can be viewed in a similar
context. In direct calorimetry heat production is
measured directly to provide a measure of metabolic rate
or function.All energy metabolism in the body ultimately depends
on the utilization of oxygen. Indirect calorimetry
involves measuring the consumption of oxygen (O2) and the
production of carbon dioxide (CO2) to provide an indirect
estimate of energy metabolism. There are many different
gas analysis techniques used in the prior art of indirect
calorimetry. These gas analysis techniques are used by
physicians for clinical reasons, by athletes to measure
performance, and by coaches to measure fitness levels.It has been known for some time that the analysis of
a subject's respired air provides valuable information
relating to the physical condition of the subject. The
four most commonly measured variables are respiratory
volume, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production,
and respiratory exchange ratio (RQ), which is the ratio
of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed.One of the earliest efforts to conduct indirect
metabolic rate analysis involved use of a so-called
Douglas Bag. A Douglas Bag metabolic analysis technique
involved the timed collection of expired breath in a
rubberized bag, measuring the volume of expired gas
collected, and analyzing the gas composition contained
within the rubberized bag for O2 and CO2 content. Metabolic rates were then calculated from the data
obtained. The Douglas Bag technique was time consuming,
subject to error, and could only be performed on
relatively stationary subjects in well-equipped
laboratories. Also, this technique was not well suited
to the measurement of short-duration transients in
metabolic functions.Since the data obtained from respiratory gas
analysis is so valuable in diagnosing cardiopulmonary
dysfunction and evaluating overall cardiovascular
fitness, intense effort has been directed towards the
development of simpler, faster, automated metabolic
analyzers. The intense interest in physical fitness and
aerobic exercise, such as running, has helped to focus
further effort in this field. Many instruments are
presently available for the determination of the total
volume of respired air from a subject being studied.
These devices include spirometers, plethysmographs, and
pneum
