<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel amide derivatives
and dermatologic preparations containing the same.
More particularly, it relates to dermatologic preparations
capable of fundamentally improving the barrier
functions of the horny layer, namely, exerting effects
of maintaining normal barrier functions and restoring
damaged barrier functions.The skin, in particular, the horny layer is an
extremely thin epidermic constituent which is located
on the outermost side of the body. It not only protects
the body from external irritation and invasion of
foreign substances but also inhibits the loss and
evaporation of the constituents and moisture contained
in the body. Those protecting effects, i.e., the
barrier functions of the horny layer are important in
controlling the homeostasis in the physiological functions
of the skin.When these barrier functions of the horny layer
are weakened by some internal or external reasons, for 
example, the skin frequently suffers from troubles such
as inflammation, chapping or the acceleration of aging.
Therefore, it is needless to say that the maintenance
and reinforcement of the barrier functions of the horny
layer are highly important for the skin and, in its
turn, for our healthy daily life.To prevent the occurrence of these skin troubles
or to remedy the same, there have been employed dermatologic
preparations containing various natural and
synthetic ingredients. However, most of these dermatologic
preparations aim at humidifying the skin and
making up for the barrier functions by forming a coating
on the surface of the skin. Namely, these dermatologic
preparations merely make up for the barrier
functions of the skin by forming a tentative coating on
the surface of the skin. Thus they cannot be expected
too much in the effects of essentially improving
(maintaining and restoring) the barrier functions.Thus, the present applicant has formerly proposed
dermatologic preparations containing amide derivatives
represented by the following general formula as dermatologic
preparations capable of essentially improving
the barrier functions of the skin (see Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 306952/1990). Further, Scott et al. have
proposed cosmetic compositions containing amide derivatives 
of similar structures (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 225907/1992). Although these amide derivatives
act on the horny layer and thus exert effects of
essentially improving the barrier functions of the
skin, the application of them to dermatologic preparations
still involves some problems relating to
