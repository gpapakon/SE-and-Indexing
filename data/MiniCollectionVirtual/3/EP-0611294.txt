<ABSTRACT>
A cryosurgical probe has an elongate housing with a tip region (12) at one end, a first passageway (20) extending from an inlet for cryogen to the tip region and a second passageway (24) extending from the tip region to an outlet to exhaust. An insulating jacket (28) is provided, which may be air filled or partially evacuated, to insulate at least part of the external surface of the probe housing remote from the tip region in order to ensure that that part of the surface does not become frozen. Damage to tissue outside the area to be treated is thereby minimised, even in cases where the probe is inserted deeply into the tumour.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Cryosurgical ApparatusThis invention relates to cryosurgical apparatus, and in particular concerns a cryosurgical probe suitable for intra organ penetration.Cryosurgical probes may be used in the treatment of tumours, for example, using techniques in which a probe tip is inserted to the area of tissue required to be removed and then cooled by the passage therethrough of a cryogen to freeze, and therefore destroy, the tissue surrounding the probe tip. It is desirable to control as carefully as possible a number of parameters, including the speed and extent of the freezing, in order to ensure that tumourouε area is completely destroyed with minimum concomitant damage to surrounding healthy tissue .The present invention seeks to provide apparatus which may be inserted deeply within an organ whilst mitigating or obviating damage of healthy tissue.According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a cryosurgical probe comprising an elongate housing having a tip region at one end thereof, a first passageway extending from an inlet to the tip region and 

 a second passageway extending from the tip region to an outlet and in communication with the first passageway at the tip region, and insulating means for insulating the external surface of the housing in a region remote from the tip region.According to another aspect of the invention there is provided cryosurgical apparatus comprising an elongate housing having a closed tip region at one end thereof and inlet means and outlet means for a cryogenic fluid on the housing, a first passageway within the housing in communication with the inlet means for deli¬ very of cryogenic fluid along substantially the entire length of the housing to the tip region to cause cooling of the tip region, a second passageway within the hous¬ ing for return of cryogenic fluid from the tip region along substantially the entire length of the housing to the outlet means, and means for insulating the external surface of the housing in a region remote from the tip.Preferably the first and second passageways are defined by two tubes of generally circular cross- section. One tube may have a smaller diameter than the other and may be located internally thereof. In the preferred embodiment, the smaller diameter tube is concentric with the larger diameter tube. The first passageway in the preferred embodiment is defined by the 

internal surface of the smaller tube, and the second passageway in the preferred embodiment is annular in cross-section and bounded by the external surface

Claims : -
1. A cryosurgical probe comprising an elongate housing having a tip region at one end thereof, a first passageway extending from an inlet to the tip region and a second passageway extending from the tip region to an outlet and in communication with the first passageway at the tip region, and insulating means for insulating the external surface of the housing in a region remote from the tip region.
2. A probe according to Claim 1 wherein the first and second passageways are defined by two tubes of generally circular crosεsection.
3. A probe according to Claim 2 wherein the first tube has a smaller diameter than the second and is located concentrically internally thereof.
4. A probe according to any of the preceding Claims wherein the insulating means comprises a gas jacket.
5. A probe according to Claim 4 when dependent on
Claim 3 wherein the gas jacket is located around the external surface of the larger tube, to form an outer annular chamber. 


 6. A probe according to Claim 4 or Claim 5 wherein the jacket contains air.
7. A probe according to any of Claims 4 to 6 wherein the jacket is partially evacuated.
8. A probe substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
9. Any novel subject matter or combination including novel subject matter disclosed, whether or not within the scope of or relating to the same invention as any of the preceding Claims.
