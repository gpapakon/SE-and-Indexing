<ABSTRACT>
A flush-mounted apparatus for communications technology having a supporting ring and a housing, which is held thereon, for accommodating the connecting lead, the terminal strips and the plug devices. The technical problem is to provide a flush-mounted apparatus into which the cable can be inserted in any alignment. The terminal strips (3) and the plug devices (4) are seated on a printed circuit board (2) which can be inserted into the housing (1) in four positions which are rotated through 90@ with respect to one another in each case.

having a supporting ring (6) and, held thereon, a housing 

(1) for receiving the terminal lead (20), the connecting 
strips (3) and the plug-in apparatus (4), characterized in 

that the connecting strips (3) and the plug-in apparatus 
(4) are seated on a printed circuit board (2) which can be 

inserted into the housing (1) in four positions, each 
turned through 90Â° with respect to one another. 
A flush-mounted device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the housing (1) has a chamber (7) 

with a cable entry (8) and an approximately square bearing 
surface for the printed circuit board (2). 
A flush-mounted device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the bearing surface is defined by 

four ledges (10) having aligning domes (11). 
A flush-mounted device according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the printed circuit board (2) has 

corner cutouts (14) shaped to correspond to the ledges (10) 
and recesses (15) fitting the aligning domes (11). 
A flush-mounted device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the surfaces of the ledges (10) and 

the corner cutouts (14) have a contour in the shape of a 
quarter circle. 
A flush-mounted device according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the printed circuit board (2) is 

seated on a sleeve formation (12) of the chamber (7) and is
