<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerator includes an improved air return system 
providing a channel (92) of air below the crisper pans (66,68). 

Particularly, 
a separator top (44) is positioned above a separator insulation body (72) 

to define a space (92) therebetween providing an air flow path for 
channeling return air flow. An inlet (94) to the space is positioned 

proximate the front of the separator wall and an outlet (86) is 
positioned proximate the rear of the separator. An air flow 

passage through the separator is in communication with the outlet 
for returning refrigerated air to the freezer compartment (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigeration apparatus 
and, more particularly, to a bottom mount refrigerator air return 
system. Conventional frostless-type refrigerators utilize 
forced refrigerated air flow to cool fresh food and freezer 
compartments. An electric fan draws refrigerated air across an 
evaporator coil, with most of the air being forced into the 
freezer compartment and then returned to the evaporator. Some 
of the refrigerated air is delivered to the fresh food 
compartment through an air inlet opening therein. A damper may 
be provided at the air inlet opening that is typically located 
at the upper central portion of a rear wall in the fresh food 
compartment. Suitable air return openings are provided for 
returning air from the fresh food compartment to the evaporator. A refrigeration apparatus in one known form comprises 
a refrigerator/freezer having a bottom mount freezer. 
Particularly, a separator or divider including a rigid body of 
insulation sandwiched between a top wall and a bottom wall, each 
of plastic or metal, separates the two compartments. The air 
return opening is provided through the separator, usually at a 
rear corner. Thus, while air may freely circulate through the 
fresh food compartment, the most direct path from the inlet to 
the return is along the back wall of the fresh food compartment. A typical refrigeration apparatus includes storage 
pans, often called crisper pans, slidably mounted at the bottom 
of the fresh food compartment. Thus, they are spaced a very 
short distance above the separator. With a bottom mount unit, 
the temperature below the crisper pans can be quite cold due to 
proximity to the freezer compartment. This problem is typically 
solved by adding a foil heater between the separator insulation 
and top wall or by increasing insulation thickness. Such a 
heater increases energy costs, both for running the heater itself  
 
and the increased time which the compressor must be run to 
compensate for added heat. The present invention overcomes the above problems of 
prior refrigeration apparatus, in a novel and simple manner. In accordance with the invention, a refrigeration 
apparatus is provided with an air return system for channeling 
air across the bottom of a fresh food compartment. Broadly, there is disclosed herein an improved air 
return system in a refrigeration apparatus including a cabinet 
defining a fresh food compartment above a freezer compartment 
separated by an insulated separator. Means are included for 
providing
