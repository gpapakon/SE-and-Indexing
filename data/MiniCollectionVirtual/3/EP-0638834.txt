<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid-crystal display device having a pi-cell 
configuration between crossed polarizers and having a liquid-crystal 

retardation value such that it is possible to switch from a Bright state 
at low voltage to a Dark state at high voltage, the voltage for setting 

the Dark state can be lowered by making use of retardation films whose 
optical axes are parallel to the cell surfaces and perpendicular to the 

projection direction of the liquid-crystal director on the cell surfaces. 
Positioning of said films on both sides of the pi-cell in such a way that 

the total film retardation on the one side is equal to that on the other 
side results in angle-of-view-dependent transmission characteristics 

having better symmetry than in the case of the films being positioned on 
one side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to display devices and 
particularly to those of the type defined in claim 1 in which 
use is made of electro-optical effects which occur in so-called 
Pi-cell liquid crystal configurations. The Pi-cell configuration has recently been introduced as an 
electro-optical liquid-crystal effect for applications in which large 
angles of view are required at all grey levels (intermediate transmission 
levels between the "Dark" state and the "Bright" state). It is 
described in : 
1. A conference paper by P. Bos and J. Rahman at the SID International 
Symposium, Seattle, Washington. May 18-20, 1993. 
(SID Digest of Technical Papers, Volume XXIV, p. 273-276) 2. A conference paper by Y. Yamaguchi, T. Miyashita and 
T. Uchida at the same SID International Symposium. 
(SID Digest of Technical Papers, Volume XXIV, p. 277-280) the contents of which are included in the present application 
by way of reference. The abovementioned paper by P. Bos and J. Rahman explains, 
inter alia, why the Pi-cell liquid-crystal configuration is suitable for 
applications such as the abovementioned. This is related to the special 
liquid-crystal configuration (Pi-cell) in which use is made of "reversed" 
pretilt orientation at the cell surfaces. The resulting Pi-cell liquid-crystal 
configuration shows optical "self-compensating" behaviour, in 
which less variation occurs in the effective birefringence as a function 
of the angle of view, compared to conventional electro-optical birefringent 
liquid-crystal effects with liquid-crystal director configurations 
having parallel pretilt orientation at the cell surfaces. The said lower variation in the effective birefringence results 
in a larger, more symmetrical angle of view. If the Pi-cell is used in  
 
combination with an optical compensator which has a negative value for 
the birefringence (or retardation) and which is positioned in such a way 
with respect to the Pi-cell that the optical axis of the compensator is 
positioned perpendicularly with respect to the Pi-cell surfaces, the 
angle-of-view dependence of the electro-optical effect is found to be 
improved yet further, and even to a considerable extent. If the pi-cell, 
in combination or not in combination with the negative retardation compensator, 
is placed between two crossed polarizers which (both) form an 
angle of 45째 with the projection of the liquid-crystal director on the 
cell surfaces, it is possible, given a suitable choice of the retardation 
of the liquid-crystal cell (i.e. the value of the
