particular for a SIM-card, said contacting apparatus

having a contact support (11) supporting contact
elements (36) which comprise terminal ends (37)

being adapted for SMT (surface mounted technology),
said contact support (11) providing only the

function of contacting but not the function of
guiding the chipcard (14), and wherein said contact

support (11) has smaller dimensions than the
chipcard (14),

said contact support (11) being designed as a SMT-component
in which said contact elements are

injection molded, said injection molded contact
elements improving the stability of the contacting

apparatus, wherein said contact support comprises
one section (31) having substantially the shape of a

non rectangular parallelogramm. 
The contacting apparatus of claim 1, characterized in
that guide means (12) for the SIM-card are arranged

spaced from said contact support (11).
The contacting apparatus of claim 2, characterized in
that said guide means (12) are mounted independently

of the contact support (11) at a housing (15) above
said contact support (11).
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said contact

support (11) is provided with an integrated metal
insert (43).
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said contact

support (11) is made of plastic material and
comprises a metal frame (43) which extends adjacent

to the side edges of said contact support (11) and is
embedded therein.
Contacting apparatus as set forth in claim 5,
characterized in that said metal frame (43) forms a

soldering base point (46) at one of the narrow sides
(53) of said contact support.
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that all of the

termination ends (37) of the contact elements (36)
exit at one (52)of the narrow sides of the contact

support (11).
Contacting apparatus as set forth in claim 6 or 7,
characterized in that the narrow side (52) of the

contact support where the termination ends (37) exit

is offset with respect to the narrow side (53) at
which the soldering base point (46) exits. 
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that each contact

element is provided at least in the area of contact
cusps (139) with a layer (140) of noble metal, said

layer being applied mechanically/physically.
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the contact

support comprises slots (33) and recesses (34)
adapted to receive the contact elements (36).
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said metal

frame (43) is generally U-shaped.
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the width of

the contact support (11) is narrower than the width
of the chip-card (14), said contact support tapering

like a wedge on opposite sides (forming triangular
free spaces 101, 102).
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that, for a dense

arrangement within a housing (217), a collar (207)
extending about the contacting apparatus (201) is

provided which provides sealing between the housing
(217) and the contacting apparatus (201), and that

further at the axial end of the contacting apparatus
(201) which is opposite to the end of the contacting

apparatus where the contact elements (210, 214) exit
for contacting the chip-card, a continuous planar

support surface (250) is provided for forming a seal
between the contacting apparatus (201) and a printed

circuit board (222) on which said contacting
apparatus (201) is arranged. 
Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said

contacting apparatus comprises a body made of plastic
material, said body comprising an insert portion

(209), a collar (207) and a box portion (253),
wherein said contact elements (210) comprise the

contact ends (11) which extend beyond the upper
surface (213) of the insert portion (209), while said

termination ends (212) are guided out of the free end
of the box portion, said free end forming a surface

(250) which is adapted to be sealingly mounted to a
printed circuit board (222), and wherein a support

surface (208) is located at the collar portion (207)
opposite to the surface (250) for being sealingly

mounted to a housing (217).
Contacting apparatus as set forth in claim 14,
characterized in that the collar (207) extends beyond

the circumference of the insert portion (209) as well
as beyond the circumference of the box portion (253)

Contacting apparatus as set forth in any of claims
13-15, characterized in that the collar (207)

comprises cut-outs (244) in the area of the
termination ends (212) of the contact elements (210),

whereby a sufficient collar width remains so as to
guarantee a safe sealing effect.
