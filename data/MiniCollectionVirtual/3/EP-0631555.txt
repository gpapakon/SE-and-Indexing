<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cartoner assemblies and 
methods for the packaging industry. Particularly, this 
invention relates to continuous motion cartoner assemblies 
to load article groups into opened carton sleeves. The cartoner assembly of the present invention is 
particularly designed to be fully adjustable to package 
different types, styles and sizes of articles, i.e. cans 
and bottles, and a wide range of article group patterns. 
The cartoner assembly is easily adjustable to meet the 
changes of these article parameters and loads the article 
groups into the carton sleeves in a fast and reliable 
manner. In the past, various machines and processes have been 
proposed and utilized to continuously package selected 
article groups into cartons. Each prior art machine and 
process, however, accomplishes the packaging of the 
article groups in a distinct manner and utilizes 
particular machinery. For example, article groups can be 
continuously selected from an article infeed stream or 
provided in a preselected manner, dropped into or placed 
onto partially opened or erected cartons and subsequently 
closed. Alternatively, carton blanks are folded and 
constructed about individual article groups, which 
generally requires the use of particular carton structures 
as well as cooperating carton folding and constructing  
 
equipment. These prior art cartoners have limited 
adjustability, limited output capability, restricted use 
and have been difficult and costly to maintain due to 
their respective designs. Prior art cartoner assemblies include U.S. Patent 
4,802,324 to applicants' assignee for a Vertical Cartoning 
Assembly and Method which discloses the placement and 
assembly of cartons over preselected article groups being 
moved on a conveyor. In operation, folded cartons are 
placed between carton flights and lowered over moving 
preselected article groups by means of a cam rail/cam 
follower structure. The cartons are subsequently folded 
and closed into a wrapped configuration to yield a stream 
of packaged product. Further, U.S. Patent 5,036,644, also 
to applicants' assignee, discloses a Packaging Sleever 
Assembly which transfers flat packaging sleeves directly 
onto preselected article groups and subsequently wraps and 
closes the cartons. The latter assembly utilizes cam 
actuated flight bar structures which move in a generally 
perpendicular direction relative to the article transfer 
conveyor to select article groups and to transfer carton 
sleeve structures for subsequent wrapping and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cartoner assembly (10) for loading article groups (19) into open carton 
sleeves (17), comprising: 


(a) an article infeed conveyor (13) having a plurality of parallel guide 
structures (43) fixed thereabove, said article infeed conveyor supplying a first 

longitudinal stream of articles; 
(b) a carton supply conveyor (12) providing a second longitudinal 
stream of cartons with open ends facing moving article groups, and 
(c) article group transfer means (15) for moving article groups into the 
open ends of the carton sleeves, said article group transfer means comprising 

guide support means (91) longitudinally moving in parallel synchronization with 
said carton supply conveyor, a plurality of transversely operative, longitudinally 

moving pushing mechanisms (89), and activation means (90) to transversely 
move said pushing mechanisms at predetermined longitudinal positions,
 
   characterised in that the assembly further comprises an article selecting 

conveyor (14) having a plurality of spaced, parallel and transversely oriented 
fixed flight bars (52) and a longitudinal travel path disposed adjacent to and 

parallel with main portions of said article infeed guide structures (43), said flight 
bars intersecting angled terminal portions (44) of said article infeed guide 

structures at a predetermined angle to form and move a third longitudinal stream 
of article groups of a predetermined pattern, and in that die carton supply 

conveyor has spaced carton flight lugs (75, 76) synchronized and moving 
adjacent to and parallel with said article selecting conveyor. 
A cartoner assembly according to claim 1 wherein said carton flight lugs 
(75,76) are adjustable with respect to each other in both transverse and 

longitudinal directions and said carton supply conveyor further comprises two 
pairs of driven endless chains (77) having spaced connecting means attaching said 

lugs, and wherein said driven chains include drive means comprising a first drive  
 

shaft having at least one trailing sprocket and at least one leading sprocket, and 
a second drive shaft, said leading sprocket being driven by said first drive shaft, 

and said trailing sprocket being mounted on bushings so that they freely rotate 
about said first drive shaft and are driven by said second drive shaft in 

synchronization with said first drive shaft. 
A cartoner assembly according to claim 1 or 2 wherein for loading article 
groups into open carton sleeves said activation means (90) of said article group 

transfer means comprises a cam track/cam follower assembly and said pushing 
mechanisms (89) each include a movable head member cam activatable at 

predetermined times and a pivotable member connected to said movable head 
member and having a cam follower acted upon by said cam track/cam follower 

assembly. 
The cartoner assembly of claim 3, wherein said head member has a fixed 
and cam activated extensible face portions. 
A cartoner assembly according to any preceding claim and further 
comprising article tunnel means (157) movable between said carton supply means 

and said article group transfer means, said article funnel means comprising cam 
activatable opposing vertically disposed plate members, whereby said article 

funnel means guides said article groups into the cartons and controls carton flap 
position as said article group transfer means is operative. 
A cartoner assembly according to claim 1 and further comprising: 

a frame structuring having an elongated, horizontal working area, two 
pairs of longitudinally oriented carton drive chains (77) connected to said lugs 

(75,76), a pair of longitudinally oriented article drive chains parallel to said 
carton drive chains and synchronised means to drive said chains.
