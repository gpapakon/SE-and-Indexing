<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
markers used for the identification of a cylindrical 
object, and more particularly, to a dispenser which 
facilitates the handling of a series of wire markers, 
application of indicia to the wire markers and cutting 
of an individual wire marker from the series. Figure 1 illustrates a wire marker 10 as it is 
attached to an electrical wire 12 for identification 
of the same. The wire marker 10 usually consists of a 
blank of flexible material such as cardboard or, 
preferably, plastic which has holes adjacent each end. 
Bending of the wire marker 10 allows the wire 12 to be 
passed through the holes. Resiliency of the wire 
marker 10 causes the edges of the holes to grip the 
wire 12 and maintain the wire marker 10 in a desired 
position along the wire 12. Indicia 14 may be applied 
to the wire marker 10 by printing, typing or writing 
to identify the electrical circuit to which the wire 
12 is a part. The wire marker 10 pictured in Figure 1 
is conventional and forms no part of the present 
invention. The present invention is directed to a 
dispenser for a series of wire markers 10 which 
facilitates the handling of a series of such markers 
10 wound into a spool.  
 From US-A-3 035 345 a tape dispenser is known premitting 
feeding of a tape from a roll and cutting thereof into 
different desired lengths as controlled by the user. This 
known dispenser comprises a housing of joined walls 
defining an open interior, and a door providing acess to 
the housing interior adapted to receive a length of tape. 
A slot communicated between the interior and the exterior 
of the housing is sized to permit passage of the length of 
tape. Adjacent the slot there is provided a track for 
guiding the length of tape after it exits the housing 
interior through the slot. The track is designed as an 
opening in the housing for accessing the lengths of tape 
extending along the track by a finger of a hand. Underneath 
the length of tape extending along the track there 
is arranged a resiliently movable advancement means frictionally 
engageable with the length of tape upon pressing 
the same against the advancement means and feeding the 
length of tape by the finger. The fed length of tape can 
be cut off by means of a cutting means disposed adjacent 
the track and opposite the slot. It is the object of the present invention to provide a 
dispenser for dispensing in seriatim fashion wire markers 
from a series of joined wire markers each defined by a 
length of material
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dispenser adapted to dispense in seriatim fashion 
wire markers (10) from a series of joined wire 

markers (10) each defined by a length of material 
including a hole at each end of the length of 

material, the dispenser comprising: 

a housing of joined walls (18) defining an open 
interior, 
a door (20) providing access to said interior of 
said housing, 
a length of the joined wire markers (10) disposed 
within said interior of said housing, 
a slot (24) communicating between said interior of 
said housing and the exterior of said housing and 

sized to permit passage of said wire markers (10) 
from said housing interior to said housing exterior, 
a track (26) disposed on the exterior of said 
housing adjacent said slot (24) for guiding said 

wire markers (10) after said wire markers (10) 
exit said housing interior through said slot (24), 
means (32) for cutting said length of wire markers 
(10) into individual wire markers (10), said means 

(32) for cutting disposed adjacent said track (26) 
and opposite said slot (24), and 
an advancement slot (38) within said track (26) in 
register with said holes of said wire markers (10) 

when said wire markers (10) are disposed within 
said track (26), said advancement slot (38) terminating 

at a predetermined location spaced from 
said means (32) for cutting such that insertion of 

a pointed object (42) through one of said holes in 
one of said individual wire markers (10) and into 

said advancement slot (38) and movement of said  
 

pointed object (42) along said advancement slot 
(38) toward said means (32) for cutting will 

advance said wire marker (10) along said track 
(26) toward said means (32) for cutting until 

movement of said pointed object (42) within said 
advancement slot (38) is ended by said termination 

of said advancement slot (38), thus positioning 
said individual wire marker (10) at said predetermined 

position for cutting. 
A dispenser according to claim 1 wherein said 
advancement slot (38) is a depression in said housing 

extending parallel to said track (26). 
A dispenser according to claim 2 further including a 
recess (40) disposed at said termination of said 

advancement slot (38) which recess extends further 
into said housing than said advancement slot (38) so 

that said pointed object (42) falls into said 
depression upon reaching said termination of said 

advancement slot (38) to provide a tactile indication 
that the termination of said advancement slot (38) 

has been reached. 
A dispenser according to claim 2 wherein said 
advancement slot (38) extends completely through a 

wall (18) of said housing.
