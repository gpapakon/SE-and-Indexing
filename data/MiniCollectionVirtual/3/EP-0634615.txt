geometrical parallel through which the refrigerant may pass by providing 

a refrigerant distributor between an inlet (26) and the tubes (18) which 
includes an orifice (86) connected to the inlet (26) for directing a 

stream of refrigerant toward a flat impingement surface (102) from which 
it is disbursed to a plurality of receiver passages (34) angularly 

spaced about the periphery of the impingement surface (102) and 
respectively connected by a fluid passage (38,44,50) to an associated

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to evaporators, and more
particularly, to evaporators that are employed to evaporate a
refrigerant in a refrigeration or air-conditioning system.In the last decade or so, considerable effort has
been expended to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles.
This effort has resulted in virtually every component of a
vehicle being reviewed for its effect on fuel economy. In
general terms, the main focus has been on the weight of the
component and on the effect of a component on vehicle
aerodynamics, that is, on the drag coefficient of the vehicle.In many instances, a given component will affect one
or the other, but not both, of the above considerations. In
other cases, a given component can have an effect on both.
Examples in the latter category include many of the heat
exchangers employed in a vehicle as, for example, radiator and
air-conditioning system components.Such components add weight to the vehicle and to the
extent that their volume may affect the frontal area or some
other part of the vehicular envelope, the drag coefficient as
well. Consequently, there is an ongoing effort to not only
reduce the weight of such heat exchangers as by switching to
light weight components, but to reduce the volume as well
since such will not only be accompanied by a reduction in
weight, but may permit a reduction in some part of the
envelope of the vehicle which allows a reduction in the drag
coefficient.At the same time, the heat exchange capabilities of
a system including such components does not diminish and may
even increase. Consequently, a reduction in the size of the
heat exchanger which would, all other things being equal, 
reduce the heat exchange capability of the system in which it
is used, must be offset or compensated for by increased
efficiency. For if efficiency cannot be improved, in order to
meet the heat exchange requirements of a given system, desired
size reductions cannot be accomplished and weight reduction
efforts will be limited to the availability of lighter weight
components that may be substituted for those currently in use.While over the years there have evolved a number of
set techniques that may tend to increase heat exchanger
efficiency, in many respects, attempts to use these techniques
to obtain greater efficiency in refrigeration or air-conditioning
systems simply are not successful because of the
fact of two-phase flow in a system heat exchanger such as the
condenser or evaporator. That is to say, because heat
exchangers of these types are dealing with a
