<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to recording apparatus employing heating elements for
the recording process, More particularly, the invention relates to a drive device and a drive
method for driving the heating elements in such apparatus.US-A-4,364,063 discloses a thermal recording apparatus in which a line of resistive heating
elements are selectively driven according to current and previous (historical) recording signals.
The drive of the heating elements on not only the current but also the previous recording
signals is done in order to avoid excessive heating in case the recording signals require one and
the same heating element to be driven in successive recording cycles or recording lines. Thus,
in a current recording cycle, less electric energy will be applied to a heating element that was
energized in the preceding recording cycle, than to a heating element that was not energized in
the preceding recording cycle. This is commonly referred to as "historical drive control". To
accomplish such historical drive control the above mentioned document uses two or three shift
registers and a latch circuit each having a number of 1-bit stages corresponding to the number
of heating elements to be driven. First, the drive data for one recording line (one data for each
heating element) are loaded into a first one of the shift registers and then transferred to the
latch circuit. In accordance with the data in the latch circuit, a first drive pulse is applied to
selected ones of the heating elements. Then the drive data are sequentially read out from the
first shift register and written into the second shift register while at the same time the previous
drive data are read out from the second shift register. The data of corresponding stages of the
first and second shift registers are compared with each other and either are the data in the
respective stage of the first shift register or that of a third shift register modified depending on
the comparison result. The modified data from the first or the third shift register are then
latched in the latch circuit. In accordance with the data in the latch circuit, a second drive
pulse is applied to selected ones of the heating elements. This process is periodically repeated,
each cycle corresponding to one recording line. As a result, in a certain cycle, each heating
element to be energized in this cycle but not energized in the preceding cycle will be energized
during a time corresponding to the sum of the first and second drive pulses, while heating
elements
