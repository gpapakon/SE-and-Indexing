<ABSTRACT>
Optimal constructions for two motor/controller configurations (20) are disclosed. The controller structure includes an H-bridge (48) for controlling field current using synchronous-rectification of MOSFET (58, 60, 62, 64) devices, and a circuit for chopping the armature (36) current using synchronous-rectification of MOSFET (44, 46) devices arranged in a half bridge. The controller (20) may be configured with a series-wound or a separately excited DC traction motor. In the series-wound motor/controller configuration, the field (38) and the armature (36) current are separately controlled. In the separately excited motor/controller configuration, the field (38) of the motor is preferably wound so that the rated field current is achieved at about 20 % of the rated battery voltage. This provides a separately excited motor in which the field current can be boosted by a factor of 5 to achieve high start-up and low speed torques which match the torque outputs of a series-wound motor under similar operating conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to solid-state electronic
controls for direct current traction motors, and more particularly to
controls for direct current traction motors used in electrically
powered vehicle applications. The present invention further relates
to optimal direct current motor/controller configurations designed to
provide efficient electric power drives.Electrically driven vehicles such as forklifts and the like
require drive systems which are capable of delivering high start-up
and low speed torques for accelerating the vehicle, propelling loads
up grades, creeping under load, etc. Series-wound DC motors are
capable of generating very high start-up and low speed torques. For
this reason, the traditional drive motor of choice for most
electrically powered vehicles has been the series-wound DC motor.
Nonetheless, series-wound DC motors have a number of recognized
characteristics which are not advantageous. For instance, the speed
of a series-wound DC motor will vary significantly with a load. In
addition, reversing, braking and field weakening a Series motor
requires robust contactors which are capable of handling full
armature current. Such contactors are expensive to install and
maintain.An alternative to the series-wound DC motor is the separately
excited DC motor. Separately excited motors do not suffer from the
disadvantages of the series-wound DC motor but they do not provide
the advantage of high start-up and low speed torques which the
series-wound motor is capable of generating.It has been suggested that series-wound motors be operated in
a separately excited fashion in which the field and armature currents
are independently controlled. Hong and Park in an article entitled
"Microprocessor-Based High-Efficiency Drive Of A DC Motor" IEEE
Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Vol. IE-34, No. 4, November,
1987, discuss the operation of series and separately excited electric 
motors using a microprocessor based control algorithm wherein a table
look up for an optimum field current to armature current ratio is
based on a function of motor rotational speed. In a DC machine,
there are many combinations of field and armature current which will
provide a desired motor speed and torque. One combination of field
and armature current will produce the desired motor speed and torque
most efficiently. It has been proposed that a constant ratio "k" of
field to armature current can be used to determine the optimum field
and armature currents. Hong and Park demonstrate that "k" should
vary as a
