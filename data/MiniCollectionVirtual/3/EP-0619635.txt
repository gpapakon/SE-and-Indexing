<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a holder, in particular made of plastic, for cables or tubes, having a substantially dimensionally stable base body which is open on one side. The base body can be closed via a movable limb carrying a catch mechanism. For the closure of the holder, the catch mechanism engages in an engaging window of complementary shape. The catch mechanism consists of a moulding curved in the shape of a hook, one hook limb of which is articulated on the movable limb of the base body and the other limb of which widens in the shape of a wedge to form a catch lug on which an opening lever is integrally moulded via a film hinge. Arranged above the engaging window is an abutment which cooperates with the opening lever and forms a bilateral lever, so that upon opening the catch mechanism the catch lug is levered out of the engaging window.

<CLAIMS>
A holder, more particularly of plastic, for a 
plurality of cables or tubes, comprising a 

substantially dimensionally stable main member (15) 
which is open on one side but closable, an arm (5) 

being movably articulated on said main element and 
having at its end remote from the point of articulation 

(17) a releasable detent mechanism (1) which, to close 
the holder, engages in an engagement window (10) of 

matching shape, and in that the detent mechanism (1) 
comprises a shaped member (2) which is curved in the 

form of a hook and opens outwardly and one limb (3) of 
which is connected to the movably articulated limb (5) 

and the other limb (4) of the hook is thickened in the 
form of a wedge to form a detent lug (6), in that a 

substantially semi-circular abutment (13) is provided 
on the main element (15) opposite the detent mechanism 

above the engagement aperture of the engagement window 
(10) receiving the detent mechanism (1) and in that an 

opening lever (8) connected via an integral hinge (7) 
to the hook limb (4) forming the detent lug (6) is made 

substantially semi-circular in opposition to the shape 
of the abutment so that the abutment (13) and the 

opening lever (8) roll relatively to one another for 
the purpose of opening the detent mechanism (1). 
A holder according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the abutment (13) at least substantially spans the 

entire outer angle between the main element (15) and 
the engagement window (10). 
A holder according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that a relief recess (19) is formed on  

 
the abutment (13) to accommodate a relief wedge (20) 

and/or reinforcing'ribs are formed in and/or on the 
abutment. 
A holder according to claims 1 to 3, characterised 

in that a relief wedge (20) of the relief recess (19) 
is so disposed on the opening lever (8) with matching 

shape that the relief wedge (20) engages in said relief 
recess (19) when the detent mechanism (1) is closed. 
A holder according to any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that at least one 

fixing element, more particularly after the style of an 
expanding dowel (14), is integrally formed on the main 

element (15) of the holder to fix the latter and an 
attachment rail (16) for coupling other installation 

elements is integrally formed or other fixing elements 
are integrally formed. 
A holder according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that at least two holders are arranged 

symmetrically to one another integrally, particularly 
with a common main element spine (18). 
A holder according to any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the two hook limbs 

(3, 4) are interconnected so as to resiliently expand 
to form the hook-shaped part (2) and the detent lug (6) 

having the wedge-shaped thickening on the hook limb (4) 
is so disposed that on introduction of the detent 

mechanism (1) into the engagement window (10) it 
engages behind the upper web thereof.  

 
A holder according to any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that at least one stud 

(9) is so formed beneath the hook-shaped part (2) 
spaced therefrom inside the limb (5) that the resulting 

intermediate space accommodates the bottom detent eye 
web (12) of the engagement window. 
A holder according to any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the engagement 

window (10) is integrally formed on the dimensionally 
stable main element (15) extending in the direction of 

the point of articulation (17) of the movable limb (5), 
substantially opposite the latter, with a slight bend 

in the direction of the main element (15).
