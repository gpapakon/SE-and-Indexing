<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process 
for the production of polysuccinimide by the thermal 

condensation of aspartic acid wherein the rate of 
reaction is increased by contacting the aspartic acid 

with a gas containing a catalytic amount of carbon 
dioxide. When the atmosphere in contact with the 

aspartic acid during the condensation reaction 
contains about 10 percent, by volume, carbon dioxide, 

substantially complete conversion to the polymer 
occurs within about one hour when the reaction is 

performed in a tray dryer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
preparing polysuccinimide and the hydrolysis thereof to
form polyaspartic acids or salts. More particularly
this invention relates to novel processes for preparing
polysuccinimide from aspartic acid wherein a catalyst
is introduced which causes the acid to react in a
thermal condensation reaction at an increased rate.The thermal condensation of alpha amino acids
to form polymers with loss of water has been known for
many years. Early interest in such processes related
to theories for formation of prebiotic polypeptides.
For the purpose of testing such theories laboratory
experiments used powdered L-aspartic acid, usually
packed in the bottom of a flask which was then heated
below the melting point of the acid. Such reactions
were slow and took place over many hours. One such
example is reported by Kokufuta et al. in Bulletin of
the Chemical Society of Japan Vol. 51 (5) 1555-1556
(1978) "Temperature Effect on the Molecular Weight and
the Optical Purity of Anhydropolyaspartic Acid Prepared
by Thermal Polycondensation." The structure of
anhydropolyaspartic acid has been thoroughly
investigated such as by J. Kovacs et al. in J.O.C.S.
Vol. 26 1084-1091 (1961).In recent years many utilities have been
suggested for anhydropolyamino acid. Such polyamides
have been suggested as potential drug carriers by Neuse
et al. in Die Angewandte Makronmolekulare Chemie 192
35-50 (1991) "Water-soluble polyamides as potential
drug carriers." They have also been tested as scale
inhibitors with respect to natural sea water and
calcium sulfate in particular by Sarig et al. as
reported by the National Council on Research and 
Development (NRCD 8-76, Seawater Desalination 150-157
(1977). Polyaspartic acid has been well known for its
ability to disperse solid particles in detergent
formulations, having been mentioned as a dispersant in
numerous patents, a few of which are U.S. Patents
4,363,497; 4,333,844; 4,407,722 and 4,428,749. As a
departure from the usual manner of utilizing
polyaspartic acid in detergent formulations it is
reported in Australian Patent A-14775/92 that the
polyamide is added to the wash liquor which, upon
hydrolysis in situ, is converted into a biodegradable
polypeptide builder. Also, as described in U.S. Patent
4,971,724 to Kalota et al., it has been discovered that
compositions comprising polyamino acids such as
aspartic acid, when ionized at alkaline pH, effectively
inhibit corrosion of ferrous metals in the presence of
aqueous medium. Various derivatives of
