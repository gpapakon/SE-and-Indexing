<ABSTRACT>
A process for the synthesis of semi-synthetic glycosaminoglycans of 
general formula III 


is described in which one of the saccharide units characteristic of 
glycosaminoglycans with heparin or heparan structure, more 

specifically that of α-L-iduronic-2-O-sulfate acid, has undergone a 
structural modification, entirely or in part, with transformation into α-L-galacturonic 

acid substituted in position 3 with nucleophilic radicals 
of general formula II 


Said process is carried out by treating glycosaminoglycans with heparin 
or heparan structure by means of a nucleophilic reagent in alkaline 

medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
In US patent 5,010,063 a description was given of a structural 
modification, in basic medium, of glycosaminoglycans with heparin 
and heparan structure with subsequent isolation from the reaction 
mixture of new derivatives with respect to the state of the art, as 
demonstrated unmistakably by the chemical and physical characteristics 
and especially by the 13C-NMR spectrum. In the subsequent US patent 5,104,860 a further structural modification 
was described, in a basic or neutral medium, which, starting from the 
products formed in the reaction conditions described in US patent 
5,010,063, and from the glycosaminoglycans with heparin or heparan  
 
structure used as starting products in the same patent, originated a 
range of new products, different from those described in said patent 
and new with respect to the state of the art, as demonstrated 
unmistakably by the chemical and physical characteristics and 
especially by the 13C-NMR spectrum. The chemical and physical characteristics of the products described in 
US patent 5,010,063 and the results of a subsequent structural study 
described by Jaseia M., Rej R., Sauriol F., Perlin A.S. in Can. J. 
Chem 67, 1449-56 (1989), with the specific aim of explaining the 
mechanism of the reaction of structural modification in a basic 
medium, have demonstrated that these derivatives show a modification 
which concerns just one of the saccharide units characteristic of 
glycosaminoglycans with heparin or heparan structure, more 
specifically the unit of α-L-iduronic acid sulfated in position 2 and 
involving its transformation into a 2,3-epoxygulonic unit. The so 
obtained epoxydes are represented by the following general formula IV 
Likewise it has been demonstrated that semi-synthetic 
glycosaminoglycans with one 2,3-epoxygulonic unit and also 
glycosaminoglycans with heparin or heparan structure, in conditions of  
 
reaction similar to those described in US patent 5,104,860 undergo a 
structural modification which also concerns the saccharide unit of α-L-iduronic 
acid sulfated in position 2 and involving the transformation of 
this saccharide unit into a unit of non-sulfated α-L-iduronic acid or α-L-galacturonic 
acid, according to the conditions of reaction used. So US patent 5,010,063 describes semi-synthetic glycosaminoglycans 
containing an epoxy function between positions 2 and 3 of the unit of 
α-L-iduronic-2-O-sulfate acid taken as a starting point and the 
conditions of reaction necessary for obtaining them, while US patent
