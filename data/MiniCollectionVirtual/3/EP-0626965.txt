<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
separating stereoisomers of folinic acid.Folinic acid, i.e. N-(5-formyl-(6R,S)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroyl)-L-glutamic
acid, when obtained by
chemical synthesis, is formed by an equimolar mixture
of its two (6R) and (6S) diastereomeric forms.It is known that only the (6S) isomer, as calcium salt,
has the well-known pharmacological activity of the
product, while the other one is totally devoid of it.
Therefore, there is a strong need for a process
allowing the preparation of the optically pure (6S)
form.Various attempts were made to synthetize (6S) isomer
through asymmetrical synthesis but they were not fully
successful from the industrial point of view.As far as the separation of both diastereomers from
their equimolar mixture is concerned, it is worth
citing US patent 2688018 and patent application WO
88/03844, even if they have not yet provided the ideal
solution to the problem.EP-A-455013 discloses ammonium salts of N5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic
acid which can be used for the
separation of the (6R) or (6S) diastereoisomers.It has now been found a process allowing the separation
and the isolation with good yields of the two optically
pure (6R) and (6S) forms of folinic acid, both free and
salified with alkaline-earth metal ions, from the
equimolar diastereomeric mixture produced by chemical
synthesis starting from folic acid.Another remarkable embodiment of this invention relates
to a process for the preparation and isolation of salt
derivatives of (6R)-folinic acid, respectively (6S)-folinic  
acid, characterised by an excellent optical
purity (O.P.), with suitable at least dibasic organic
amines, which are aliphatic, straight, cyclic and/or
heterocyclic, from said diastereomeric equimolar
mixture.Another remarkable embodiment of this invention is
represented by the new salts of (6R)-folinic and/or
(6S)-folinic acid with said amines.Folinic acid is usually prepared by synthesis starting
from folic acid, which contains a (S) chiral centre in
that part of the molecule corresponding to (S)-glutamic
acid. By hydrogenating the double bond between the 5-and
6- positions of the pterinic residue, a new chiral
centre in the 6- position is originated with a (6R,S)
configuration. The subsequent formylation step of
nitrogen atom at the 5- position leads to the
production of (6R,S)-folinic acid.It now has been surprisingly found that, by crystallization
of (6R,S)-folinic acid salts with at least
dibasic organic amines from a suitable solvent or,
preferably, from
