<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for mechanically preparing the ground of areas to be planted, especially of forest areas to be planted with trees, the ground being loosened by means of a rotavator (7, 8) arranged on a ground-preparing machine (1). So that an efficient, but environmentally friendly and ground-protecting preparation of the areas to be planted can be carried out, it is proposed to loosen the ground to be planted solely in the region of the travelling track of the ground-planting machine (1) and then to introduce the plants into these areas. The respective track spacings are preferably selected in such a way that they correspond to the spacings of the plant rows. The ground region between the travelling tracks, that is to say approximately 80% of the forest floor, remains unaffected. In the ground-preparing machine (1) according to the invention for carrying out the method, provision is therefore made for arranging at least two rotavators (7, 8) on the rear vehicle part (6) of the ground-preparing machine (1). These rotavators (7, 8) loosen only the ground at the respective tracks made by the ground-preparing machine (1).
