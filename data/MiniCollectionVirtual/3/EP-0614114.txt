<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material of which spectral 
sensitivity to red light is enhanced and anti-staining 
property is improved. Means to expand sensitivity of spectral wave length 
region of silver halide emulsion, to enhance sensitivity is 
well-known as spectral sensitization. As for spectral 
sensitizing dye used for this purpose, a lot of compounds such 
as cyanine dyes and merocyanine dyes are known. These spectral sensitization dyes are required not only 
to be capable of expanding light-sensitive wave length region 
of silver halide emulsion, but also to satisfy various other 
conditions given below: 
1) The spectral sensitizing region is appropriate. 2) The spectral sensitization efficiency is high.  3) Occurrence of fog, gamma change, etc. do not adversely 
affect the characteristic curve. 4) When the silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material comprising the sensitizing dye, especially when it is 
preserved for a long period of time under conditions of high 
humidity and high temperature), photographic properties such 
as fog do not change. 5) The dye incorporated does not diffuse to another layer 
of different spectral sensitivity and 6) the dye does not 
cause color contamination. 6) Color staining does not cause after development, 
fixation and washing or stabilization processes are completed 
due to dissolving of the dye into processing solution.
 
However , the sensitizing dyes heretofore known in the art do 
not fully satisfy all these conditions, And they have not come 
up to the standard. Especially, since processing time of the photographic 
material has become shorter and processing without washing or 
rinsing step with recycling use of the processing solution is 
adopted, the dye becomes more liable to remain in the 
photographic material. As a result, color contamination, 
which is hereinafter called as color stain, comes to take 
place easily in the photographic material and this remarkably 
damages the product value of the photographic material. In 
other words, as far as the sensitizing dyes are concerned, 
improvement in anti- color-staining property has become an  
 
important technical problem to be solved. As the sensitizing dye which is capable of increasing 
sensitivity in red light wave length region, validity of the 
following dyes are known in the art. They are, for example, 
complex cyanine dyes and complex merocyanine dyes disclosed in
