<ABSTRACT>
A fastening device for window frames, in particular for rail vehicles, is provided, with holders which are fastened on the outer circumference of the window frame at intervals and can be fastened to the wall structure surrounding the window frame. In order to avoid stresses from the window frame in the surrounding wall structure, the holders (9) consist of an elastic material and have clamping jaws (13, 13') which engage over clips (8) which are attached to the wall structure and clamp tight to the said wall structure as a result of the intrinsic elasticity of the material of the holders.
