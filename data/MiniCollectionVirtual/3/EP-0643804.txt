<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
the controlled operation of engine operation cycles 
and more particularly to a preestablished logic 
pattern and the modifying of the pattern to 
sequentially and modulateably controlling valve timing 
to reduce engine combustion noise. An annoying problem with a diesel engine is 
combustion noise. A major portion of the combustion 
noise is generated during the premixed phase and 
arises from the combustion rate of the diesel fuel 
when it first ignites after the ignition delay period. 
The ignition delay period is the period of time from 
the start of fuel injection into the combustion 
chamber until ignition occurs. The length of the 
ignition delay period is dependent on several factors: 
the quality of the fuel, cetane number, and cylinder 
temperature. Fuel that has been properly vaporized 
and mixed with air burns in a very rapid manner which 
causes high rates of pressure rise in the cylinders 
and subsequent high noise levels. The length of the 
ignition delay period influences the severity of the 
noise produced as it determines the amount of fuel 
that will be ready to be burned. The length of the 
ignition delay is strongly dependent on combustion 
chamber air temperature during the initial part of the 
fuel injection schedule. Diesels are normally a lot 
louder at high speed, low load conditions than at high  
 
speed, high load conditions. Ignition delay tends to get 
longer at low loads because the cylinder walls are cooler 
and as the air is compressed on the compression stroke it 
loses more heat so at the beginning of fuel injection the 
temperature in the combustion chamber is relatively low 
which delays ignition. Ignition delay also gets longer 
because fuel systems spray quality is often lower at low 
deliveries and air density is lower which results in slower 
rates of fuel mixing and vaporisation. Thus, what is needed is an apparatus to reduce 
combustion noise by elevating the temperature of the air in 
a selected one of the combustion chambers so that at the 
start of the compression stroke the temperature of the air 
is elevated reducing the preestablished ignition delay 
period. The present invention is directed to overcome one or 
more of the problems as set fourth above. GB-A-2165587 discloses an engine in which the oxygen 
content of the air for combustion is reduced by opening the 
inlet valve during the exhaust stroke. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
an engine includes a plurality of combustion chambers,
