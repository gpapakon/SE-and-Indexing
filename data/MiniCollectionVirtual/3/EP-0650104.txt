<ABSTRACT>
A preconditioning process and dual electrostatic brush cleaning apparatus for 
reducing adhesion of toner particles on the photoreceptor (10) surface such that cleaning of 

the photoreceptor (10) is enhanced. Preconditioning of the brush (82) and/or the 
photoreceptor (Fig.5) in the cleaning apparatus 
allows for cleaning of dual polarity toners, 
CAD toners and DAD toners. The apparatus may include a second brush (83), downstream of 

the first (82), and biassed to a potential (+ V) opposite to that (-V) of the first brush. The 
preconditioning of the brush (82) means that it does not need replenishing once the print 

operation begins due to the electrostatics that maintain a constant predetermined level of 
toner in the brush (82).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an electrostatographic printer and copier, and 
more particularly, concerns a process for preconditioning a cleaning apparatus for removal of 
residual particles and agglomerates from the imaging surface (e.g. photoreceptor and 
photoconductor). Electrostatographic printers and copiers can create often difficult cleaning problems 
on the imaging surface and, when toners of more then one polarity are involved these difficult 
cleaning problems are compounded making it difficult for conventional cleaners to handle. In a colored image forming apparatus, an electrostatic latent image which is to be 
developed by a predetermined color is formed on a photoconductor by an optical system of a 
copying machine or printer. Then, the electrostatic latent image is developed by a developing 
unit which accommodates a predetermined colored toner to be used for development. This 
toner image may be subsequently transferred to a support surface such as copy paper to which 
it may be permanently affixed by heating or by the application of pressure. After each transfer 
process, the toner remaining on the photoconductor is cleaned by a cleaning device. However, when colored toners other than black toner are cleaned from the 
photoreceptor, there is a tendency for more residual toner to remain on the photoconductor. 
Thus, the photoreceptor is not able to be efficiently cleaned by the same process that is used to 
clean black toner alone from the photoreceptor. Possible reasons for the additional filming on 
the photoconductor caused by the color toners are the dye, pigment or additive used in the 
color toners. For example, zinc stearate (ZnSt) and Aerosil are essential additives to the color 
toners to enhance toner flow and stabilize developer conductivity. During the printing process 
the ZnSt is preferentially developed in the background regions of the photoreceptor, not 
transferred to the print paper, and subsequently smeared on the photoreceptor by the cleaner 
brushes. As the ZnSt film thickens with time, Aerosil particles become embedded in the film, 
causing a secondary print quality defect referred to as deletions, Charge Area Development 
(CAD) loss, or lateral charge conductivity. Certain print mode and/or material mass per unit time throughput (i.e., where 
throughput is greater than 5% color area coverage) conditions in a single pass highlight color 
printer enable or promote photoreceptor filming by the Discharge Area Development (DAD) 
toner additive zinc stearate
