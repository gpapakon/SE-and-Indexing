<ABSTRACT>
Textile discs and wheels for surface lapping/buffing 
are impregnated with a resin solution containing an 

abrasive powder suspended therein. Following vacuum impregnation 
and centrifugation, the impregnated buffing 

discs and wheels are oven-treated for polymerizing the 
resin. The abrasive powder incorporated in the impregnating 

resin provides a source of abrasive material 
in the work area of the disc or wheel, thus making up 

for the abrasive paste shortage during intervals 
between successive paste applications. This allows a 

considerable saving of abrasive paste while increasing 
buffing disc life.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the mechanical surface
treatment by which the untreated surface is lapped and
eventually buffed in the final treatment stages. This
type of surface treatment can be carried out on metals,
painted or varnished surfaces, cast or injection-molded
plastics and the like.In lapping/buffing treatments (mechanical buffing),
textile buffing discs or wheels are almost exclusively
used and an abrasive paste is intermittently distributed
on the work area. The cloths or plaits used
are usually made of natural fibres such as cotton,
agave sisal, flax, hemp, wool and jute, on account of
these natural fibres' higher resistance to overheating
during treatment. A wide range of cloths and abrasive
pastes selections may create operating conditions
ranging from highly abrasive lapping to almost purely
buffing treatments. As experienced operators know,
there may be several intermediate stages of
leveling/buffing through which abrasive properties are
progressively reduced and viceversa buffing/polishing
properties increased.The so-called simple discs, which commonly consist
of many cloth discs superimposed and sewn together by
means of concentric quilts, are generally used only on
"hand-operated" buffing machines. The rotating disc is
in fact quite compact which may cause overheating that
can be controlled only in the case of non-continuous
machining and under the operator's supervision. At any
moment, an experienced user is able to assess abrasive
paste losses due to melting and overheating and take
appropriate measures. On the contrary, in continuous
operations, both with flat-bed machines and rotary-table
machines, almost only the so-called "ventilated
discs" are used. These discs - or wheels, as they are
more appropriately called - are obtained by assembling
radially oriented cloth strips or plaits. They are 
pleated or undulated, often with special oriented
pleats or "discs". The work area is the wheel outer
periphery. Therefore, the air radially flowing from the
wheel center towards the periphery - accelerated by
appropriately-shaped holes or air intakes in the wheel
truing plates - "cools down" the peripheral work area
of the wheel, thus allowing non-stop machining. The
abrasive paste is intermittently distributed on the
work area, by injecting it through appropriately
oriented nozzles.Both in the case of simple discs and ventilated
wheels, the intermittent feeding of abrasive paste in
the work area entails periodic, even drastic changes in
the operating conditions. Actually, the work run shows
