<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of the 
compounds 1α,25(R),26-trihydroxy-22-ene-cholecalciferol and 
1α,25(S),26-trihydroxy-22-ene-cholecalciferol, represented by the 
formula 
This process comprises 
a) reacting a compound of the formula Ph3P=CHLi, with a specific 
epimer of the formula 
 
   wherein X is an oxygen protecting group, 
to form the corresponding specific epimer of the formula 
b) reacting the specific epimer of formula IV with a compound of 
the formula 
 
   wherein Y is an oxygen protecting group, 
to form the corresponding specific epimer of the formula 
 
   wherein X and Y are as described above,  c) converting the specific epimer of formula VI into the 
corresponding specific epimer of the formula  
 
 d) isomerizing the specific epimer of formula VII to form the 
corresponding specific epimer of formula I.   A process for preparing compounds of formula I is described in US 5 110 958. This 
process utilizes intermediates having the same 5Z, 7E configuration as the products of 
formula I. In the instant process the intermediates of formulae V to VII have the 5E, 
7E configuration.  
 A preferred aspect of the invention is the reaction of a 
compound of formula IV with a compound of formula V to a 
compound of formula VI, wherein X and Y are silyl containing oxygen 
protecting groups. It is understood that while the C-25 epimers are prepared and 
discussed individually, mixtures of the C-25 epimers are also within 
the scope of the invention. As used herein, the term "oxygen 
protecting group" denotes an ether or silyl ether group, such as 
tetrahydropyranyl or -Si(R1,R2,R3), wherein R1, R2, and R3 are 
independently alkyl or phenyl, preferably a trialkylsilyl group. The 
term "alkyl" denotes a straight-chain or branched chain alkyl group 
containing 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 6, carbon atoms. In accordance with the invention, a compound of the formula 
[Ph3P-CH3]+Z-, wherein Z is halogen other than fluorine, is treated with 
sec.butyllithium or tert.butyllithium in an aprotic organic solvent, 
preferably ether, to form a known compound of formula Ph3P=CHLi, 
which is reacted with a specific epimer of formula III, a known 
compound or which can be prepared by known methods, to yield the  
 
corresponding specific epimer of formula IV. The reaction is carried 
out in an aprotic organic solvent, such as THF or preferably ether. The specific epimer of formula IV is reacted with a compound of 
formula V, a known compound or which can be prepared by known 
methods, to
