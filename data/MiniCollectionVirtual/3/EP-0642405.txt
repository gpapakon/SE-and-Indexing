<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a thermoformable conductive plastic laminate for use in making plastic parts adapted for electrostatic spray painting of a uniform high quality paint finish includes forming a matte release coated casting sheet (20), casting an electrically conductive polymer (24) in thin film form on the casting sheet, drying to form a conductive primer coat (24), and transfer-laminating the conductive coating to a thin, thermoformable plastic face sheet (26). The matte release coat (20) has fine particulate filler that transfer a micro-roughened matte surface to the conductive primer coat (24). The conductive primer (24) includes a polyester resin containing a fine particulate conductive material such as carbon black and, preferably, an anti-blocking agent such as fumed silica. The primer coated face sheet (26) can be thermoformed and bonded to an underlying plastic substrate panel (28). The conductive primer (24) has sufficient elongation and maintains uniform electrical surface conductivity and film thickness throughout the transfer-laminating, thermoforming and substrate panel-cladding process. The uniform surface resistivity of the conductive primer film (24) is sufficient to permit electrostatic spray painting of the finished contoured panel and in one embodiment of the finished contoured panel and in one embodiment produces a Class "A" quality exterior automatic paint finish on the resulting panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for making an
electrostatic spray painted plastic panel.In a typical electrostatic spray painting process,
the spray head is maintained at a high voltage (50-140
KV) while the object being sprayed (the substrate) is
electrically grounded. When a metal substrate is
painted, it is relatively simple to maintain the metal
at ground potential. In the electrostatic painting
process, particles (paint droplets) are charged by an
electrode in the spray head, and a charged spray cloud
from the spray head is attracted to the metal surface
by the high voltage difference. This process greatly 
reduces over-spray and produces a high quality surface
on the painted metal parts. For these reasons, and
others, electrostatic spray painting techniques have
been used for many years in the automotive industry for
spray painting exterior body panels made of sheet
metal.In recent years, the automotive industry has
increased its use of plastic materials for exterior car
body panels and trim parts. The predominant reasons
are weight-reduction and the fact that car builders
have had available more sophisticated high impact
strength plastics such as polycarbonates. To a large
extent, the future success of plastics for large car
body panels will depend on their ability to be painted
"on-line" in the assembly plant with a class "A"
quality appearance similar to painted metal car body
panels. Electrostatic spray painting of plastic car
body panels has been used for years. However,
difficulties arise when using electrostatic spray
techniques for painting plastic substrates. The
problem is particularly difficult when the objective is
to paint plastics with the same high quality and
appearance as metal parts using electrostatic paint
spray equipment.In order to electrostatically spray paint plastic
substrates, a number of technical problems must be
overcome. For instance, electrostatic charges
accumulate on the surface of a plastic substrate during
the electrostatic spray painting process. The charges
that accumulate do not dissipate as readily as with
metals. This accumulation of charges reduces the
potential between the spray head and the substrate,
leading to weaker electrical forces on the charged
paint droplets. The accumulated charges on the
substrate surface also cause an opposing electrical
field that repels air-borne paint particles; and the
accumulated charges tend to produce a non-uniform field 
across the surface. These phenomena produce a self-limiting
effect of yielding less paint
