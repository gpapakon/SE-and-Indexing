<ABSTRACT>
A cellular telecommunication system comprised of low-Earth 
orbiting satellites (12) featuring allocation of 

communication channels among users in cells (34) is disclosed. 
Each subscriber unit (26) is programmed with an embedded 

class identifier. During periods when it is desirable to limit 
acquisition of a satellite (12) to some restricted class or set 

of classes, such as periods of heavy use, the satellite 
broadcasts a list of inhibited class identifiers allowing only 

uninhibited classes access to the communication system. The 
method reduces thrashing by allowing access to users on a 

hierarchy class basis. The method uses both real time cell 
loading data and historical cell loading information based on 

previous experiences and can be programmed to limit access to 
emergency services in the case of natural disasters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to communication
systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to
systems that divide an area within which communications are
to take place into cells and which allocates limited spectral
resources among the various users in the cells.Conventional cellular communication systems, adopt a
method for subscribers to access the communication system.
Generally speaking, system antennas are erected at spaced
apart locations. Each system antenna, along with transmitter
power, receiver sensitivity, and geographical features, defines
a cell location and size. A cell is a geographical area on the
surface of the earth within which communications may take
place via a subscriber unit having predetermined operating
characteristics and via the cell's antenna. In a cellular system
that efficiently uses the spectrum allocated to it, system
antennas are located to minimize overlap between their
respective cells and to reduce gaps between the cells.The spectrum allocated to a conventional cellular system
is divided into a few discrete portions, typically frequency
bands (also referred to as "channels"). Each cell is allocated
one or more of the discrete portions of the spectrum, and each
cell is preferably surrounded by cells that use other discrete
portions of the spectrum. Communications within a cell use
only the discrete portion of the spectrum allocated to the cell,
and interference between communications taking place in other
nearby cells is minimized because communications in such
nearby cells use different portions of the spectrum. Cochannel
cells are cells that reuse the same discrete portion of
spectrum. To minimize interference, the frequency reuse plan
spaces co-channel cells a predetermined distance apart. In conventional cellular communication systems,
subscriber units acquire a radio channel by randomly selecting
one of several acquisition channels provided by the system in a
specific area of coverage, for example, a cell. To gain access
to the communication system, the subscriber unit initiates a
protocol with the system in an acquisition channel. Examples
of protocols include ALOHA-type protocols well known in the
art. The subscriber unit receives as part of the protocol, an
assignment of a specific channel called the traffic channel on
which to communicate.ALOHA schemes typically comprise four modes: 1)
Transmission Mode where users transmit an acquisition
request message to the system; 2) Listening Mode where after
transmitting the acquisition request
