<ABSTRACT>
This invention permits transferring calls along with 
data that identifies, for example, the caller's name, 

pertinent account information, any transaction 
information acquired prior to the need to transfer the 

call and why the caller is being transferred between a 
plurality of call centers (50,71). The method and system of the 

invention, therefore, coordinate a voice component and a 
data component of a call to transfer the call from a 

first call center across a communication path such as a 
switching network (84) to a second call center. The first 

call center includes the necessary network control 
circuitry to direct an associated switching network to 

transfer to the second call center the voice component of 
the call together with an identifier for uniquely 

identifying the call. The identifier may be generated 
using DNIS and/or ISDN protocol principles. The method 

and system also generate and direct a transfer screen 
from the first call center to the second call center. 

The unique identifier also attaches to the transfer 
screen. Using the unique identifier at the second call 

control center, the invention uses an automatic call 
distributor or similar routing device to route the voice 

component to an available customer service 
representative. The routing device then informs control 

circuitry of the second call center of the customer 
service representative's identity. Then 
the control 
circuitry sends the transfer screen to a workstation 

where the customer service representative may service the 
call with the aid of the transfer screen information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to telecommunications systems and 
methods for controlling such systems and, more particularly, to a 
method and system for transferring calls and call-related data between 
a plurality of call centres. Examples of call-related data are data 
that identifies the caller's name, pertinent account information, any 
transaction information acquired prior to the need to transfer the call 
and why they are being transferred between a plurality of call centers.  The global marketplace is becoming more open and 
more efficient at providing goods and services. 
Inexpensive global communication and transportation make 
it possible for consumers and suppliers to develop and 
maintain relationships without ever meeting face-to-face. 
In this environment, customer service is a crucial factor 
that separates the strong businesses from the weak and is 
a logical focal point for companies that seek to gain 
market share for both new and existing products. For a supplier or vendor who offers telephone order 
placement, service, or a combination of both order 
placement and service, the customer service 
representative (CSR)-sometimes referred to more simply as 
"the agent"-is the interface between the customer on the 
outside and the business on the inside. The CSR works to 
keep customers happy, and serves as a crucial link 
between the customer and the internal operations of the 
company. Moreover, the CSR is a comparatively expensive 
portion of the overall customer service picture. It is, 
therefore, very important that the CSR perform 
efficiently. Good customer service from a CSR's 
perspective means being able to access the corporate 
information that he or she needs to provide maximum 
service and responsiveness to a customer inquiry. Another part of good customer service is the ability 
to receive incoming calls and intelligently route them to 
the most qualified available agent. In many call center 
(CC) environments, for example, agents are typically 
segregated into groups, groups are assigned to handle 
specific call types arriving on telephone trunks, and 
trunks are designated for particular purposes such as 
support and product inquiry. One problem associated with providing quality 
customer service through a CSR is that in some customer 
call centers, important callers are often left on hold 
for long periods of time waiting for the few highly-skilled  
 
agents that can best handle their calls. 
Additionally, important callers frequently may be 
connected to agents that
