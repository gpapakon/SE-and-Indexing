A process of making pieces of jewellery comprising one or more set jewels, 
comprising the steps of 


making a master pattern having empty settings for the jewels, 
modelling a master mold using the master pattern containing 
no jewels, 
making a pattern in the master mold using a wax as a pattern-making 
composition which can be cast or injection-molded and 

can be expelled by being heated, 
inserting the jeweils into the settings of the pattern, 
fixing each jewel in its setting by plastically deforming the 
setting of the pattern, 
making a casting mold in that the pattern is embedded in 
a refrectory molding composition and expelling the pattern-making 

composition from the casting mold, 
pouring metal into the casting mold, 
removing the piece of jewellery from the mold when the 
metal has solidified. 
A process of making patterns from a wax as a pattern-making composition 
which can be cast or injection-molded and can be expelled by being heated
 
for use in a process of making pieces of jewellery comp
rising one or a  
 

plurality of set jewels, wherein a casting mold is made in that the pattern is 
embedded in a refractory molding composition and the pattern-making composition 

is subsequently expelled, metal is poured into the casting mold and 
the respective piece of jewellery is removed from the mold after the metal has 

solidified,
 
comprising the steps of 


making a master pattern having empty settings for the jewels, 
modelling a master mold using the master pattern containing 
no jewels, 
making a pattern in the master mold using the pattern-making 
composition, 
inserting the jewels into the pattern, 
fixing each jewel in its setting by plastically deforming the 
setting of the pattern. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the settings are 
thermally deformed. 
A process according to claim 3, characterized in that a tool which conforms to 
the top end of a given setting is heated and engaged with the setting and the 

setting is deformed in a single step in that pressure is applied to the tool. 
A process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
settings are only locally deformed. 
A process according to claim 5, characterized in that in pin settings or tab settings 
only a part of the pins or tabs is deformed.
