<ABSTRACT>
A droplet jet apparatus using an actuator serves 
as an electromechanical transducer that acts as an energy 

generator used for the ejection of droplets. The actuator 
has a plurality of grooves and walls made of piezoelectric 

material that define liquid channels and pressure 
chambers. Drive electrodes are formed on both sides of 

each wall. The drive electrodes formed on both sides of 
each piezoelectric wall fall within an electrode depth 

range of ±30% or less with respect to a set value of an 
electrode depth d extending in the wall height direction. 

Thus, the droplets can be stably jetted for a long period 
of time by setting the electrode depth to a proper value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure of a 
droplet jet apparatus and, more specifically, to drive 
electrodes each formed on an actuator used as an energy 
transducer used for the ejection of droplets. Various droplet ejecting devices or jet apparatus 
using energy transducers have heretofore been developed 
for various applications such as ink-jet printers and put 
to practical use. Electrothermal transducers, such as a 
heating element, and electromechanical transducers, such 
as a piezoelectric material, are used as energy 
transducers employed in such droplet jet apparatus. A 
droplet jet apparatus using piezoelectric material in 
general has an advantage because restrictions are less on 
available liquid to be heated and there is a wide range of 
choices of the liquid as compared with an apparatus using 
a heating element. However, various problems arise in 
such apparatus in that a droplet jet apparatus using a 
piezoelectric element or actuator used as an 
electromechanical transducer has a low degree of 
integration compared with an apparatus using an 
electrothermal transducer wherein a semiconductor 
manufacturing process can be applied and a size reduction 
in the droplet jet apparatus is required. In droplet jet 
apparatus using a piezoelectric body as an energy 
transducer, an actuator or piezoelectric element is used 
having mainly piezoelectric and electrostrictive 
transversal effects, which is a so-called unimorph 
piezoelectric element or bimorph piezoelectric element. A droplet jet apparatus designed to bring a 
piezoelectric element or actuator used as an energy 
transducer into high integration has been disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,879,568, U.S. Patent No. 4,887,100, and 
U.S. Patent No. 5,016,028.  In these devices, a small-sized droplet jet 
apparatus is used that has a plurality of grooves 
(channels) serving as liquid channels and pressure 
chambers. The pressure chambers are defined in a 
piezoelectric material subjected to polarization 
processing along its thickness direction in a 
high-integration rate. Drive electrodes are formed on 
both sides of each of the walls made of piezoelectric 
materials for separating the respective grooves (channels) 
from each other to produce any piezoelectric and 
electrostrictive effects. The produced effects make a 
transformation of a shear mode and produce a pressure 
change in each groove (channel), thereby ejecting or 
jetting desired droplets from respective nozzles of a 
nozzle plate provided in front of the droplet jet 
app
