<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cement compositions which 
contain a shrinkage reducing amount of an alkyl ether derivative of 
an aliphatic polyhydroxy compound such as glycerin, preferably a 
dialkyl ether derivative and most preferably the di-t-butyl ether 
of glycerin. An important disadvantage of cement mortar and concrete is the 
tendency to shrink and crack upon setting and drying. U.S. Patent 4,547,223 addresses this problem and suggests the 
use of compounds of the general formula: 
RO(AO)nH 
in which R represents a C1-7 alkyl or C5-6 cycloalkyl radical, A 
represents one or more C2-3 alkylene radicals, and n is 1-10 as 
shrinkage reducing additives for cement. U.S. Patent 5,174,820 suggests reducing the dry shrinkage of 
cement by the addition thereto of terminal alkyletherified or 
terminal alkylesterified compounds of polymers having -C2H5O- and/or 
-C3H6O- as a repetitive unit. Japan Patent Application No. 58-60293 suggests reducing dry 
shrinkage of cement by the addition thereto of compounds of the  
 
formula: 
R1OXmYnR2 
where R1 and R2 represent aliphatics, alicyclics or aromatics having 
1 to 10 carbon atoms, X represents 
-CH2CH2O-, Y represents -CH(CH3)CH2O-, m and n are 0 or greater, and 
m + n is 1 to 15. Ostrikov, et al., Kolloidnyi Zhumal, Vol. 27, pp 82-86 (1965) 
suggests the addition of anhydrous glycerin to cement. Despite the efforts of prior workers, the problem of shrinkage 
and crack formation in the drying and setting of cement 
compositions remains a serious problem. In accordance with the present invention, it has been found 
that dry shrinkage and cracking of cement compositions can be 
significantly reduced by incorporating in the cement composition an 
effective amount of an alkyl ether derivative of an aliphatic 
polyhydroxy compound having the formula: 
Q-[(A)n-OR]x 
wherein Q is a C3-C12 aliphatic hydrocarbon group, R is hydrogen or 
a C1-C16 alkyl group with the proviso that at least one R is a C1-C16 
alkyl group, A is a C2-C4 oxyalkylene group, n is 0-10, and x is 3-5. Illustrative shrinkage reducing agents which are employed 
according to the invention are those having the above formula 
derived from C3-C12 aliphatic triols such as glycerol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, 
2,3,4-petanetriol, 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1, 3-propanetriol  
 
(trimethylol propane), 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane, 
1,2,6-trihydroxyhexane, 1,2,3-heptanetriol, 
and the like, C4-C12 aliphatic tetrols (eg. 2,3,4,5-hexanetetrol, 
sorbitan, erythritol, pentaerythritol), C5-C8 sugar 
alcohols
