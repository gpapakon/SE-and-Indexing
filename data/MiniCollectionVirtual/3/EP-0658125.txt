<ABSTRACT>
Electrical stimuli (22) delivered to cardiac tissue (10) at times determined from a chaos stabilizing algorithm (34), converts arrhythmia activity to periodic beating by an interbeat interval shortening action, utilizing real time calculation based on a system parameter experimentally determined from intervention by the electrical stimuli.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to monitoring,
analyzing and modifying the pulsating behavior of active
systems, and in particular that of living cardiac
tissue.The realization that many activities of an
apparently random nature are actually examples of a
deterministic phenomenon known as chaos offers a new
approach to analysis and modification of complex
systems. Phenomena that have been shown to exhibit
chaos include the transition to turbulence in fluids,
many mechanical vibrations, irregular oscillations in
chemical reactions, the rise and fall of epidemics and
the irregular dripping of a faucet. Several studies
have argued that certain cardiac arrhythmias are also
examples of an irregular pulsating behavior
characterizable as chaos, see for example
"Phase locking period doubling bifurications and irregular
dynamics in periodically stimulated cardiac cells", Guevara et
al., Science vol. 214, pages 1350-1353 (1981)Until recently the main strategy for dealing with
a system exhibiting chaos was to develop a model of the
system sufficiently detailed to identify the key
parameters and then to change those parameters enough to
take the system out of the chaotic regime. However that
strategy is limited to systems for which a theoretical
model is known and which do not display irreversible
parametric changes (often the very changes causing the
chaos) such as aging. Recently, a strategy was
developed which does not attempt to take the system out
of the chaotic regime but uses the chaos to control the
system. The critical feature of chaos believed to make
this possible is the extreme sensitivity of chaotic
systems to perturbations of their initial conditions.
The key to such strategy lies in the fact that chaotic
motion includes an infinite number of unstable periodic
motions. A chaotic system never remains long in any of 
such unstable motions but continually switches from one
periodic motion to another, thereby giving the
appearance of randomness. It was conjectured that it
should be possible to stabilize a chaotic system around
selected periodic motions. Such system stabilizing
theory and approach was first applied experimentally (a)
to controlling the chaotic vibrations of a
magnetoelastic ribbon and (b) subsequently applied to a
diode resonator circuit and (c) in the chaotic output of
lasers. Such chaos controlling strategy involved
development of a real-time measurement of the current
system state and identification of an unstable fixed
point of interest on a plot along with its stable and
unstable
