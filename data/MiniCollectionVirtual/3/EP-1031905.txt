<ABSTRACT>
According to this invention it is possible to provide a
multi-directional input device, in which a spacer member

(33b) is interposed between a moving contact plate (31) and a
cover which is an upper member (27), forming a clearance

between the cover and the moving contact plate. The moving
contact plate (31) is held apart from the stationary contact

9220 and accordingly the tilting switch is held OFF during
normal operation. Therefore, if the operating lever (34) is

operated slightly obliquely, the moving contact plate (31)
will not come into contact with the stationary contact (22)

because of presence of the spacer member (33b), thereby
holding the tilting switch OFF. The multi-directional input

device thus constituted insures reliable and stabilized
switching operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-directional input device capable of actuating a switch by pushing and tilting an operating lever.By referring to Figs. 17 to 19, a conventional multi-directional input device will be explained. On the inside bottom surface of a housing 1 there are arranged a stationary contact 2 and a common contact 3, and are formed a moving contact plate 4 and a push switch S1.Above the moving contact plate 4, there is provided a guide portion 5 having a cantilever type pushing portion 5a. A rubber elastic body 6 is mounted on the pushing portion 5a, so that the pushing portion 5a may be operated by the operating lever 14 through the rubber elastic body 6.The open end of the housing 1 is closed with a cover 7 which is provided with a plurality of stationary contacts 10 embedded in the underside thereof. On the cover 7 a connecting member 9 is fitted to thereby attach the cover 7 to the housing 1.Inside of the housing 1, there is disposed a moving contact plate 11 made of a metal plate. Between the moving contact plate 11 and the inside bottom surface of the housing 1 a coil spring 12 is interposed to thereby elastically hold, during a normal operation, the moving contact plate 11 in contact with the stationary contact 10. Thus the coil spring 12 electrically connect the moving contact plate 11 with the common contact 3, so that the group of the stationary contacts 10 and the moving contact place 11 form eight tilting switches S2.The moving contact plate 11 is embedded in the moving member 13, which is inclinably fitted in a through hole 7a of the cover 7.The operating lever 14 which can be pushed and inclined is projecting out at the upper portion through the through hole 13a of the moving member 13, and is engaged at the lower portion with the moving member 13 and in contact with the rubber elastic body 6.Next, operation of a conventional multi-directional input device will be explained. When the operating lever 14 is in neutral position shown in Fig. 17, the moving contact plate 4 in the push switch S1 is off the stationary contact 2; that is, the contact is in OFF position. In the case of the tilting switch S2, the moving contact plate 11 is in contact with all of the stationary contacts 10; that is, all of the contacts are in ON position.When the operating lever 14 is tilted from the neutral position in an arbitrary direction, for instance in a direction shown in Fig. 18, the moving contact plate 11 rotates on the stationary contact 10 as a support located on the opposite side in
