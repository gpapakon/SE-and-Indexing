<ABSTRACT>
An in-line roller skate which has a supporting frame 
provided with two side walls (2,3) that delimit, between 

them, a recess (4) for mounting at least three aligned 
wheels (5), each wheel being mounted so that it can rotate 

about a respective axle or pivot (6) with at least one 
bearing (10) interposed, and with two supporting seats (13) 

for each axle which are formed so as to face each other in 
the side walls (2,3) in order to accommodate a hub of the 

axle of a respective wheel. Each seat (13) has an opening 
with two circular lobes (14,15) that have the same diameter 

but have centers that are spaced by less than one diameter. 
A detachable insert (16) is meant to close at least part of 

the opening of one of the lobes (14, 15) of each seat and to 
act as partial abutment for the hub seated directly in the 

other lobe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an in-line roller 
skate. Various in-line roller skates provided with wheel axle 
supporting devices have already been proposed: reference 
should be made in particular to US patent no. 5 048 848 
(Brennen J. Olson et al.), filed on June 12, 1987. This 
patent teaches to insert bush-like plugs in adapted pairs of 
oppositely arranged openings, formed in two rigid parallel 
spaced side walls of the frame of the skate which are meant 
to support the axles of the aligned wheels. A respective hub 
of an axle is inserted in each plug so that it is detachably 
supported. The bush in each plug is arranged off-center or 
away from the centerline with respect to the opening in the 
frame that is meant to accommodate it, so that by extracting 
each plug and inserting it after turning it, for example 
upside down, it is possible to change the distance of the 
respective axle from the ground or to shift it away from the 
plane of arrangement of the remaining axles of the skate. The bush-fitted plug is meant to fully bear all the 
load stresses applied to the hub which is arranged in it, 
and as it is made of plastics it is subjected to fatigue and 
thus to wearing in a relatively short time, and this can 
cause breakage. The aim of the present invention is to provide an in-line 
roller skate in which the hubs of the axles rest 
directly on portions of the frame, with a consequently more 
precise assembly that leads to an improved performance of 
the skate as a whole.  An object of the present invention is to provide a 
skate that is extremely simple both to make and to use and 
can be manufactured at competitive costs. This aim, this object, and others which will become 
apparent hereinafter are achieved by an in-line roller skate 
having a supporting frame provided with two side walls that 
delimit, between them, a recess for mounting at least three 
aligned wheels, each wheel being mounted so that it can 
rotate about a respective axle or pivot with at least one 
bearing interposed and provided with two supporting seats 
for each wheel axle, said seats being formed so as to face 
each other in said side walls in order to accommodate a hub 
of the axle of a respective wheel; characterized in that 
each one of said seats has an opening with two circular 
lobes that have the same diameter but have centers that are 
spaced by less than one diameter, and in that said skate 
comprises a detachable insert that is meant to close at 
least part of the opening of one of the lobes of each

<CLAIMS>
In-line roller skate having a supporting frame 
provided with two side walls (2,3) that delimit, between 

them, a recess (4) for mounting at least three aligned 
wheels (5), each wheel being mounted so that it can rotate 

about a respective axle (6) or pivot with at least one 
bearing (10) interposed and provided with two supporting 

seats (13) for each wheel axle (6), said seats being formed 
so as to face each other in said side walls (2,3) in order 

to accommodate a hub of the axle of a respective wheel; 
characterized in that each one of said seats (13) has an 

opening with two circular lobes (14,15) that have the same 
diameter but have centers that are spaced by less than one 

diameter, and in that said skate comprises a detachable 
insert (16) that is meant to close at least part of the 

opening of one of the lobes of each seat and to act as 
partial abutment for the hub seated directly in the other 

lobe. 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said lobes (14,15) of each supporting seat (13) are arranged 

one above the other and in that the axes of the lower and 
upper lobes of the pairs of opposite supporting seats are 

arranged on two parallel planes. 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said insert element (16) is shaped like a cylindrical 

portion. 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises a washer (18) which is inserted on each hub of 

each pivot or axle and acts as spacer between the side wall 
(3,4) and the wheel (5). 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
each supporting seat (13) is flanked, at the surface of the 

side walls (2,3) that is directed towards the mounting 
recess, by two raised portions (19,20), or protrusions, 

which are meant to act as fixed spacers between the side 
wall and the wheel (5). 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said insert (16) has a longitudinal extension that has a 

reduced thickness and is meant to protrude towards said 
mounting recess to act, during use, as a spacer between said 

side wall and said wheel. 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said insert (16) has a curved end portion which is meant to 

remain, during use, in said mounting recess to act as spacer 
between the side wall and the wheel. 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said insert (16) has a flat longitudinal surface (7) that is 

directed, during use, towards a hub (8) of the axle (6). 
Skate according to claim 8, characterized in that 
each pivot (6) has two flat regions at its ends which are 

meant, during use, to abut against the longitudinal surface 
(7) of a respective insert (16). 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said insert (16) has a longitudinal cradle-like surface 

(17a) which is directed, during use, towards a hub of the 
axle or pivot. 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said insert (16) comprises a transverse raised portion (25) 

or tab which is suitable to engage in a corresponding slot 
(26,27) in each side wall (3,4).
