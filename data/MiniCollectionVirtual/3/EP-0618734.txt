<ABSTRACT>
A picture type identifier, indicating one of intra-picture coding (an I-picture), 
forward or backward predictive coding (a P-picture) and bi-directionally 

predictive coding (a B-picture), is included (108) with a picture 
signal when the signal (100) is encoded (102) and when the signal is decoded. 

Each of initial and subsequent encoding and decoding is a function of the 
included picture type.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the processing of picture signals and, more particularly
(but not exclusively) to the coding and decoding of picture signals for transmission.In, for example, a teleconferencing system or a video telephone system,
moving picture signals are compressed and encoded by taking advantage of intra-frame
and inter-frame correlation so that they can be more efficiently transmitted over
a communication channel to a remote location.Intra-frame correlation can be utilized by an orthogonal transformation, such
as a discrete cosine transformation (DCT).Inter-frame correlation can be utilized by predictive encoding between
successive pictures. As used herein, a picture generally refers to an image represented
by a frame. When the fields of a frame are coded in a non-interlaced manner, that
is, separately, each field may be referred to as a picture.As shown in Fig. 1A of the accompanying drawings, for example, frame
pictures PC1, PC2 and PC3 are generated at time points t1, t2 and t3. As shown by
shading in Fig. 1B, the difference between the frame pictures PC1 and PC2 is obtained
as difference picture data PC12, and the difference between the frame pictures PC2
and PC3 is obtained as 
difference picture data PC23. Since there is a fairly small
change between signals of temporally neighboring frames,
transmission of only the difference picture data utilizes the
transmission channel more efficiently than transmission of the
original pictures. That is, using the difference picture data as
encoded picture signals reduces the amount of data to be
transmitted.However, if only the difference signals are
transmitted, the original picture cannot be restored. It is
advantageous to occasionally transmit a picture which is not
predictively encoded as a reference for difference picture data,
and because it is sometimes more efficient than transmitting the
picture as a predictively encoded picture.Pictures which are encoded utilizing only intra-frame
correlation and not inter-frame correlation, are referred to
herein as intra-pictures or I-pictures.Pictures which are encoded with predictive encoding
relative to one previously encoded picture are referred to herein
as predictive pictures or P-pictures. The previously encoded
picture may be an I-picture or a P-picture, and temporally
succeeds the P-picture.Pictures which are encoded with predictive encoding
relative to at most two pictures, a temporally preceding and a
temporally succeeding picture, are referred to herein as bi-directionally
predictive
