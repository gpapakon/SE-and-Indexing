<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for cooling hot gas in a reactor 
(10) which is provided with a mixing chamber (12) for hot 

gas and a chamber encompassing a bubbling fluidized bed 
(11) in the lower section of the reactor, a riser (14) in 

the middle section, a gas outlet (18) in the upper section 
of the reactor, and heat transfer surfaces for recovering 

heat from solid particles. The hot gas is introduced 
through the mixing chamber (12) into the lower 

section of the reactor. In the mixing chamber (12) solid 
particles are supplied to the hot gas for cooling the 

gas. The gas containing solid particles is conveyed into 
a separator, where a portion of the solid particles is 

separated from the gas and flows into the fluidized bed 
(11). From the separator, the gas is conveyed through the 

riser into particle separators (17) and, when purified, 
further out of the reactor (10). The solid particles 

separated in the particle separator (17) are returned to 
the lower section of the reactor. 
From the fluidized bed 
(11), cooled solid particles are conveyed to the mixing 

chamber (12) for cooling of hot gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
for cooling or utilizing hot gas in a reactor which is
provided with a hot gas inlet and a chamber encompassing
a fluidized bed in the lower section of the reactor, a
riser, and a gas outlet in the upper section of the reactor.
The invention also relates to a method, in which
solid particles are separated from a cooled gas containing
solid particles, and these separated solid particles
are returned to the lower section of the reactor for
recovering heat therefrom, and the cooled gas is discharged
from the reactor via the gas outlet.Fluid bed reactors are well applicable to cooling of hot
gases containing molten and/or vaporized components and/or
tar-like particles. Gas coolers are suited to, e.g.,
cooling of exhaust gases from industrial plants and dry
purification of gases containing dust and tar and other
condensing components, which gases have resulted from
partial oxidation of biomass, peat or coal. The hot gases
introduced into the reactor are efficiently cooled by
mixing solid particles therewith, such solid particles
having been cooled in the reactor earlier.Finnish patent 64997 teaches cooling of hot gases in
circulating fluidized bed reactors. Here hot gases are
fed as fluidizing gas into the mixing chamber of the
reactor, where the gases cool efficiently as they come
into contact with a large amount of solid particles,
i.e., bed material. Solid particles are carried by the
gas flow through the riser into the upper section of the
reactor, where they are separated and then returned to
the fluidized bed in the mixing chamber. In the riser, 
the gas flow conveying solid particles is cooled by heat
transfer surfaces.A drawback of the method described above is, however,
that the hot gases to be cooled have to fluidize a large
amount of solid particles, whereby the power requirement
is high. Furthermore, especially the chlorine-containing
gases cause corrosion in hot conditions and, therefore,
superheating of steam to high temperatures is not usually
possible in the heat transfer surfaces of the riser,
whereas SO3-containing gases may cause problems with the
heat transfer surfaces at low temperatures.In the method described above, the riser is considered a
natural place for the heat transfer surfaces because the
solids and gas flows are swift therein. The gas stream,
may, however, cause wear of the heat transfer surfaces in
the riser, especially in the lower section of the heat
exchangers arranged in the riser. Wear is attributable to
the high
