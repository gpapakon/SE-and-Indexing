<ABSTRACT>
An inexpensive wheel speed measuring gear (sensor ring) having a high corrosion resistance. This sensor ring is made 
chiefly of sintered stainless steel. The surface portion of the sensor ring contains 5-25 atm.% phosphorus, 30-70 atm.% oxygen 

and 5-5.0 atm.% iron, and at least a part of this surface portion is amorphous. The surface portion is formed by dipping a sintered 
stainless steel material in a phosphate group-containing oil of a temperature of 15-70 °C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gear for wheel
speed detection (hereinafter referred to as a sensor ring)
which is applied to an electronically controlled anti-locking
brake system (hereinafter referred to as ABS) for
an automobile and a method of manufacturing the same.In recent years, development of a safer system having
high reliability has been progressed in relation to a disc
brake system for an automobile, following increase in
social requirement for stability of an automobile. Due to
rapid development and cost reduction in microelectronics,
in particular, an ABS for preventing wheels from slip in
abrupt braking on a frozen or wet road for preventing an
accident is now starting to prevail in parts of
automobiles. However, a high economic advantage is
required for parts forming the ABS in addition to high
performance and reliability, and there still remain a
number of problems to be solved.As to a wheel speed detecting part which is the core
of the ASS, an electromagnetic system having excellent
environment resistance is now employed. A sensor ring of 
a magnetic material having a gear shaped surface of high
gear tooth pitch accuracy is employed for this detecting
system. Fig. 1A is a front elevational view of a sensor
ring, Fig. 1B is a sectional view taken along the line B -
B in Fig. 1A, and Fig. 1C is an enlarged view showing a
portion C in Fig. 1A. Fig. 2 is a diagram showing an
operation principle of electromagnetic wheel speed
detection utilizing the sensor ring shown in Fig. 1A.As shown in Fig. 2, the sensor ring 1 is mounted on a
wheel to have a constant clearance between a pole piece 3
of a sensor coil 2 and each tip of the sensor ring 1. The
electromagnetic coil 2 receives magnetic flux change which
is caused in the clearance with rotation of the wheel, to
detect an excited output voltage 5 and correctly read the
speed of each wheel. The ABS correctly operates on the
basis of the speed of each wheel as measured, to control
the brake so that the wheel is locked and will not slip.For a material for this sensor ring, excellent
corrosion resistance is required in addition to magnetic
properties as output characteristics and pitch accuracy of
teeth. Particularly as to a mounting system for the
sensor ring, a drive shaft direct mounting type is
desired. The drive shaft direct mounting type is so
simple in structure that the sensor ring can be easily
mounted, easy to maintain, and at a low cost. In such a 
drive shaft direct mounting type sensor ring, however, the
surface of the sensor ring
