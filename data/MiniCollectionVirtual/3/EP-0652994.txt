<ABSTRACT>
A cellulosic fibrous structure having two regions distinguished from one another by basis weight. The first region is an essentially continuous high basis weight network. The second region comprises a plurality of discrete low basis weight regions. The cellulosic fibers forming the plurality of second regions are generally radially oriented within each region. The cellulosic fibrous structure may be formed by a forming belt having zones of different flow resistances arranged in a particular ratio of flow resistances. The zones of different flow resistances provide for selectively draining a liquid carrier through the different zones of the belt in a radial flow pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cellulosic fibrous structures having
plural regions discriminated by basis weights. More particularly, this
invention relates to cellulosic fibrous structures having an essentially
continuous high basis weight region and discrete low basis weight regions
which comprise radially oriented fibers. The cellulosic fibrous
structures are suitable for use in consumer products.Cellulosic fibrous structures, such as paper, are well known in the
art. Such fibrous structures are in common use today for paper towels,
toilet tissue, facial tissue, etc.To meet the needs of the consumer, these cellulosic fibrous
structures must balance several competing interests. For example, the
cellulosic fibrous structure must have sufficient tensile strength to
prevent the cellulosic fibrous structure from tearing or shredding during
ordinary use or when relatively small tensile forces are applied. The
cellulosic fibrous structure must also be absorbent, so that liquids may
be quickly absorbed and fully retained by the cellulosic fibrous
structure. The cellulosic fibrous structure should also exhibit
sufficient softness, so that it is tactilely pleasant and not harsh
during use. The cellulosic fibrous structure should exhibit a high
degree of opacity, so that it does not appear flimsy or of low quality to 
the user. Against this backdrop of competing interests, the cellulosic
fibrous structure must be economical, so that it can be manufactured and
sold for a profit, and yet is still affordable to the consumer.Tensile strength, one of the aforementioned properties, is the
ability of the cellulosic fibrous structure to retain its physical
integrity during use. Tensile strength is controlled by the weakest link
under tension in the cellulosic fibrous structure. The cellulosic
fibrous structure will exhibit no greater tensile strength than that of
any region in the cellulosic fibrous structure which is undergoing a
tensile loading, as the cellulosic fibrous structure will fracture or
tear through such weakest region.The tensile strength of a cellulosic fibrous structure may be
improved by increasing the basis weight of the cellulosic fibrous
structure. However, increasing the basis weight requires more cellulosic
fibers to be utilized in the manufacture, leading to greater expense for
the consumer and requiring greater utilization of natural resources for
the raw materials.Absorbency is the property of the cellulosic fibrous structure which
allows it to attract and retain contacted fluids. Both the absolute

<CLAIMS>
A single lamina cellulosic fibrous structure (20) comprising only two
relevant kinds of regions (24, 26) disposed in a non-random, repeating pattern,

which are on the one hand a first region (24) of a relatively high basis
weight and comprising an essentially continuous network and on the other

hand a plurality of mutually discrete second regions (26) of relatively low
basis weight and being circumscribed by said first region (24), said second

regions (26) being comprised of a plurality of substantially radially oriented
fibers.
A cellulosic fibrous structure (20) according to claim 1, characterized
in that said plurality of low basis weight regions comprises at least about

10 percent, preferably at least about 20 percent of the total number of low
basis weight regions within said cellulosic fibrous structure.
A cellulosic fibrous structure (20) according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said basis weight of said high basis weight region (24) is at

least 25 percent greater than said basis weight of said low basis weight region.

in that said first region (24) of a relatively high basis weight comprises

high basis weight regions having mutually different densities.
A cellulosic fibrous structure according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that said radially oriented fibers of said low basis weight regions 

(26) are disposed in at least four quadrants of said low basis weight
region (26).
A cellulosic fibrous structure according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that said first region defines an essentially continuous load

bearing network region (24); and that said plurality of mutually discrete
second regions (26) have fewer fibers per unit area than said first region

(24), said fewer fibers within each of said second regions (26) radially
bridging said second region to said first region.
A process of producing a single lamina cellulosic fibrous structure according
to any of the preceding claims, said process comprising the steps

of:

providing a plurality of cellulosic fibers suspended in a liquid carrier;
providing a fiber retentive forming element (42) having liquid pervious

stages: a high flow rate stage with a first hydraulic radius and a low

flow rate stage with a second hydraulic radius, said high flow rate stage and
said low flow rate stage having mutually different initial mass flow rates,

whereby said fibers in said low flow rate stage drain in a substantially radially
oriented pattern towards a centroid, and thereby form a plurality of

discrete regions having a relatively lower basis weight than and being circumscribed
