<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a method for manufacturing such a heterogeneous catalyst suited for hydrogenation of aromatics which contains nickel bonded onto an aluminum oxide support. In the method a nickel-containing precursor is vaporized and introduced in gas phase into a reaction space where it is brought in contact with the aluminum oxide support material. According to the invention the nickel-containing precursor used is an organic nickel compound such as nickel acetylacetonate which is kept in a sufficiently high vapor pressure and allowed to interact with the support for a sufficiently long time to introduce the reagent in excess amounts relative to the number of bonding sites available on the support. The reaction temperature is approx. 190...220  C. The unreacted nickel compound is removed from the reaction space at the reaction temperature, and the product resulting from the interaction between the nickel compound and the support is treated at a temperature of 200...600  C to remove the organic parts of the nickel compound. The produced catalyst is treated with hydrogen at a temperature of 300...600  C to activate the catalyst. By cyclically repeating the above-described method steps 2...10 times, nickel-contained catalysts of good dispersion are attained in which the nickel content can be varied in the range 3...21 wt.% of the support weight. The catalysts have an excellent activity, particularly in a hydrogenation reaction of sulfur-free hydrocarbon feedstock.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method for manufacturing a catalyst suited for hydrogenation of aromaticsThe present invention concerns a method for manufacturing such a heterogeneous catalyst according to the preamble of claim 1 suited for hydrogenation of aromatics which contains nickel bonded onto a porous inorganic support such as alumina.Several oil-refining related processes such as hydrogenation, hydrogen cracking and methanation employ catalysts comprised of a support and nickel. Synthesis processes also use nickel catalysts. For instance, cyclohexane required for polyamide manufacture and other purposes is typically made through hydrogenation of benzene.Conventional heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts incorporate a catalytically active component bonded onto a support material. The most common methods for bonding the active components onto the support are impregnation, precipitation and ion exchange techniques. The precursors hereby are compounds of the catalytically active component such as salts, for example, which are soluble in a suitable solvent such as water, alcohol or a hydrocarbon. Owing to these premises, a plurality of work steps have compulsory in conventional catalyst manufacturing methods. Among others, the following work steps have been required: Making a solution of the catalyst species or its precursor; treatment of the support with the solution; removal and recovery of unreacted suspension; catalyst wash, drying and calcining plus separate processing steps for the activation of the catalyst.Prior-art techniques involve multiple problems related, among other things, to the great number of processing steps and difficulties in a controlled manufacture of catalysts. Obviously, the use of solvents also brings about complications owing, for instance, to their interaction with the support material and the impurities they may contain. 

The art knows also other methods for manufacturing Ni-containing hydrogenation catalysts. Uemura et al. [Sekiyo Gakkaishi 32 (1989) 15-20 and J. Chem. Eng. Jpn 22 (1989), 48-54] have prepared an Ni/Al2O3 catalyst starting from the vapor phase, whereby the precursor has been NiCl2 which was vaporized at 1073 K ( = 800 °C) and allowed to react with alumina at 1013...1073 K (= 740...800 °C). During the reaction, NiCl2 is condensed onto the alumina surface, the chloride is removed with the help of hydrogen and the nickel is reduced. The obtained Ni concentration is dependent on the used reaction time.In the catalyst manufactured according the above-described method disclosed byUemura et
