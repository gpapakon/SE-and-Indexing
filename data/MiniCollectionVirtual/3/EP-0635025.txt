<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the area of modified biomolecules
and methods of making such modified biomolecules.
More particularly, this invention relates to protein
engineering by chemical means to produce modified
proteins where one or more peptide bonds are
substituted by non-peptide linkage and one or more
encoded amino acids may be replaced by unnatural amino
acids or amino acid analogs or any other non-coded
structure.Numerous attempts have been made to develop a
successful methodology for synthesizing modified
biomolecules such as proteins, glycoproteins,
nucleotides, polysaccharides, and other biopolymers.
Such modified biomolecules are invaluable for study of
structure-activity relationships of native
biomolecules and there is a growing number of
commercial applications of these molecules for
diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.Structural modification of proteins and peptides,
normally referred to as "protein engineering" involves
the rationally designed alteration of structure with
the aim of understanding protein structure and
function and of creating a protein with new desirable
properties. In the past, this has been principally
carried out by site-directed mutagenesis or other 
techniques involving genetic manipulation. The major
drawbacks of these prior art approaches are that amino
acids replacing native amino acids are those that must
be coded genetically. As a result, other structural
variants such as unnatural amino acids or amino acid
analogs cannot be introduced in the protein backbone.
However, recent findings (Ellman, et al., Science,255:197, 1992; Noren, et al., Science,24:182, 1989)
would allow unnatural amino acids or amino acid
analogs to be incorporated into proteins in a site-specific
manner. In this approach, a codon encoding
an amino acid to be replaced is substituted by the
nonsense codon TAG by means of oligonucleotide-directed
mutagenesis. A suppressor tRNA directed
against this codon is then chemically aminoacylated
with the desired unnatural amino acid. Addition of
the amino acylated tRNA to an in vitro protein
synthesizing system programmed with the mutagenized
DNA directs the insertion of the prescribed amino acid
into the protein at the target site. Taking the
enzyme T4 lysozyme, the above authors, incorporated a
wide variety of amino acid analogs into the enzyme at
alanine 82 position with a few exceptions, for
example, of D-alanine not being incorporated.While Schultz's approach partially solves problems
posed by biosynthetic protein engineering, it does not
allow the
