<ABSTRACT>
A method for checking top and end of tape for data 
recording and reproducing apparatus is disclosed. The method 

comprises a first step for sensing a transparent tape section 
of a start portion of a tape wound about a tape take-up reel 

so as to sense the tape top. At a second step, a tape supply 
reel rotation period is detected and the detected supply reel 

rotation period is compared to a preset value. When the 
detected supply reel rotation period is not longer than the 

preset value, the tape end is checked at a predetermined 
period. However, when the detected supply
 reel rotation 
period is longer than the preset value, no tape end is 

checked. The method makes top-end checking time become 
optimal and saves power of the recording and reproducing 

apparatus, and reduces pulse noise generated in turning on or 
turning off the top-end checking LED.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a method for 
checking top and end of a tape for data recording and 
reproducing apparatus and, more particularly, to an 
improvement in the top-end checking method for making the top-end 
checking time become optimal and for saving power of the 
recording and reproducing apparatus, and for reducing the 
pulse noise generated in turning on and turning off a top-end 
checking LED. With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown a general theory 
for checking tape top and tape end for data recording and 
reproducing apparatus in accordance with the prior art. As 
shown in this drawing, when a tape cassette 1 having a top-end 
LED hole T-EH on the upper center of its bottom surface is 
loaded on a deck mechanism of the apparatus, a light emit part 
4 which comprises an LED and is provided on the deck mechanism 
will be aligned with the center of the top-end LED hole T-EH 
of the cassette 1. The opposite front side surfaces of the  
 
cassette 1 are provided with their light windows 3 and 3' for 
transmitting the light of the light emit part 4 to their 
associated light receive parts 5 and 5', which parts 5 and 5' 
are arranged on the deck mechanism so that they face the light 
windows 3 and 3' of the cassette 1 respectively. The deck 
mechanism of the data recording and reproducing apparatus 
further includes a head drum 2 which is placed in front of the 
loaded cassette 1. The head drum 2 has a head for recording 
or reproducing data on or from a tape of the cassette 1. In order to check tape top and tape end through a typical 
checking method during recording or reproducing data on or 
from the tape of the cassette 1, the light emit part 4 aligned 
with the center of the top-end LED hole of the cassette 1 
emits the light. When letting the first reel and the second 
reel of the cassette 1 of Fig. 1 be a tape supply reel and a 
tape take-up reel respectively, and letting the tape be 
primarily unwound from the first reel and be wound about the 
second reel, a first transparent tape section provided on the 
start portion of the tape appears and passes by the right 
window 3 of the cassette 1. In this case, the light of the 
light emit part 4 of the deck mechanism which was introduced 
into the hole T-EH of the cassette 1 is received by the light 
receive part 5 of the right side through both the first 
transparent tape section and the right window 3. However, 
when the magnetic coated tape section passes by the right  
 
window 3 after lapse of a predetermined time, the

<CLAIMS>
A method for checking top and end of tape for data 
recording and reproducing apparatus comprising: 

   a first step for detecting a transparent tape section of 
a top portion of a tape wound about a tape take-up reel so as 

to detect the tape top; 
   a second step for detecting a tape supply reel rotation 

period and for comparing the detected supply reel rotation 
period to a preset value; and 

   a third step for checking no tape end when the detected 
supply reel rotation period is longer than the preset value, 

but checking the tape end at a predetermined checking period 
when the detected supply reel rotation period is not longer 

than the preset value. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the preset 
value used in the second step is obtained by addition of error 

to a supply reel hub rotation period, the hub rotation period 
being obtained when only a supply reel hub is rotated with no 

tape wound about a tape supply reel. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein said 
predetermined checking period is that the shorter of a length 

of a transparent tape section provided on an end portion of 
 

the tape and a length of a tape passage between a head drum 
and a tape supply reel is shorter than a tape supply period.
