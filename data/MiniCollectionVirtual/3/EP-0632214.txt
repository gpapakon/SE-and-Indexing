<ABSTRACT>
A belt transmission mechanism has a crowned drive 
pulley, a crowned driven pulley, and a belt trained under 

tension around the crowned drive pulley and the crowned 
driven pulley. The crowned drive pulley and the crowned 

driven pulley are dimensioned to satisfy the equation:


D2/D1 = k·R1/R2 



 
where D1 is the diameter of the crowned drive pulley, D2 is 

the diameter of the crowned driven pulley, R1 is the radius 
of the crown of the crowned drive pulley, R2 is the radius 

of the crown of the crowned driven pulley, and k is a 
constant which is approximately 1. The belt transmission 

mechanism with the above drive and driven pulley dimensions 
can maintain its speed reduction ratio highly accurately 

even when the tension of the belt varies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a belt transmission 
mechanism having a belt trained under tension around a 
crowned drive pulley and a crowned driven pulley 
as defined by the features of the preamble 
of claim 1 known for instance from JP-A-2-118 248. There has heretofore been known a belt 
transmission mechanism which comprises a drive pulley 
coupled to a motor, a driven pulley having a diameter that 
is the same as or different from the diameter of the drive 
pulley, and a flat belt trained around the drive and driven 
pulleys. When the motor is energized, the driven pulley is 
rotated by the drive pulley and the belt at a predetermined 
transmission ratio. The transmission ratio between the drive and 
driven pulleys is determined by the diameters of the drive 
and driven pulleys and the speed at which the belt travels. 
The rotational speed of the motor is transmitted to the 
driven pulley while being reduced or increased to a certain 
rotational speed by the transmission ratio. Many drive and driven pulleys are crowned, i.e., 
have convex circumferential surfaces of arcuate cross 
section in the axial direction, for preventing the belt from 
being laterally dislodged from the drive and driven pulleys. 
If the tension of the belt varies, then the belt is  
 
elongated to different degrees on the drive and driven 
pulleys due to the combination of the radii of the convex 
surfaces of the crowned drive and driven pulleys, resulting 
in a change in the transmission ratio. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a belt transmission mechanism which is capable of 
maintaining a desired transmission ratio with high accuracy 
even if the tension of a belt trained around crowned drive 
and driven pulleys varies. To achieve the above object, there is provided in 
accordance with the present invention a belt transmission 
mechanism comprising a crowned drive pulley, a crowned 
driven pulley, and a belt trained under tension around the 
crowned drive pulley and the crowned driven pulley, characterised in that the 
crowned drive pulley and the crowned driven pulley being 
dimensioned to satisfy the equation: 
D2/D1 = k·R1/R2  
where D1 is the diameter of the crowned drive pulley, D2 is 
the diameter of the crowned driven pulley, R1 is the radius 
of the crown of the crowned drive pulley, R2 is the radius 
of the crown of the crowned driven pulley, and k is a 
constant which is approximately 1. The crowned drive pulley, the crowned driven pulley, 
and the belt have a speed reduction
