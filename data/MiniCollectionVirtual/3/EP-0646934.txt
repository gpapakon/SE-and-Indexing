<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method of treating water containing at least one 
dissolved radioactive species, which includes a first step of bringing the 

untreated water into contact with pyrolusite particles by forming a slurry in which 
the content of the radioactive species in the water is reduced. The pyrolusite 

particles are separated from the treated water, preferably by gravity separation, 
and may be recovered as a thickened pulp for treating further raw or partially 

treated water. The invention lends itself in particular to treating water extracted 
from underground mine workings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of treating water. More particularly the 
invention relates to a method of treating water containing radioactive 
constituents such as dissolved species of radium and uranium and their nuclear 
decay products. During underground mining operations naturally occurring subterranean water 
stored in dolomitic compartments, for example, finds it way into the stopes and 
mined out areas traversing these compartments. This water becomes mixed 
with spent mine service water, the total volume of which has to be pumped out 
of the mine workings for re-use or disposal. When the ore body being mined contains naturally occurring radioactive 
elements these tend to be leached into the water entering the mine workings. 
The presence of these elements in water extracted from underground is 
generally objectionable and its quality does not generally permit its re-use 
or 
release for disposal without at least partial removal of these mineral 
contaminants.  Manganese dioxide is one of several known solids having the property of 
adsorbing cations of uranium and other heavy metals dissolved in water. 
Development work in this regard has generally focussed on improving the 
adsorption capacity and selectivity of synthetic manganese dioxide products. 
These are generally suitable for treating relatively small amounts of heavily 
contaminated water, emanating from nuclear fuel processing plants or nuclear 
power stations, for example. Untreated water is generally brought into contact with relatively pure or modified 
manganese dioxide particles in packed beds which may be backwashed 
periodically to maintain acceptable liquid throughputs. Processes of this type 
are generally unsuitable, however, for treating large quantities of water having 
relatively low, yet still unacceptable levels of radioactive contaminants, together 
with generally innocuous, suspended particles or debris, which would foul the 
flow passages in a packed bed. The ultimate disposal of material having radioactive materials adsorbed on it 
presents a separate problem. Relatively small amounts of highly active 
adsorption with high loads of radioactive materials may be regenerated or 
disposed of with comparative ease. It is not practically feasible, however, to 
deal as readily with larger quantities of contaminated adsorbents suitable for 
treating large tonnages of effluent water intended for discharge into rivers, for 
example. This invention seeks to provide a cost-effective method of treating relatively 
large

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating water containing at least one dissolved radioactive species 
through contact with manganese dioxide characterised by the step of forming a slurry 

in which pyrolusite particles are suspended in the untreated water, whereby the 
content of the radioactive species in the water is reduced, before separating the 

pyrolusite particles from the treated water. 
A method according to claim 1 in which the untreated water is added to a pulp 
containing the pyrolusite particles in an agitated aqueous suspension in order to 

achieve contact between the untreated water and the pyrolusite particles. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the pyrolusite particles are 
separated from the treated water by gravity separation. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims in which separation of the 
pyrolusite particles from the treated water is effected by a continuous process in 

which the slurry is fed to a clarifier and the pyrolusite particles are recovered in the 
clarifier underflow as an aqueous pulp, and the treated water is recovered as an 

overflow product. 
A method according to claim 4 in which the aqueous pulp is re-used in a further step 
for reducing the content of at least one of the dissolved radioactive species in water. 
A method according to claim 4 in which the treated water is subjected to at least one 
further treatment step whereby it is brought into contact with at least one further 

batch of pyrolusite particles to form a slurry in which the content of the radioactive 
species is further reduced, and separating the pyrolusite particles from the treated 

water. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims in which the pyrolusite particles 
contain between 15 and 45% manganese dioxide. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims in which the size of the pyrolusite 
particles is at least 10µm and 90% of the particles (by mass) have a diameter of less 

than 75µm. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8 characterised by the further steps of 
recovering pyrolusite particles which have been in contact with the untreated or 

partially treated water, and introducing these into a leaching process in which the 
pyrolusite is consumed while releasing any adsorbed radioactive species.
