<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for regulating the voltage for charging a battery by an alternator compares a fist information item (V2) derived from the alternator voltage (B+), with a reference (V1) in order to generate a first excitation control signal (V3). The circuit further comprises:     a means (26) for storing a second variable information item, a means (22) comparing this second item with a reference in order to generate a second excitation control signal (V11), a means (FF4, 24) for driving the second information item, reacting to the first and second control signals (V3, V11) in order to make the said second information item vary in correspondence with the variations in the first information item, but at a reduced rate, upon a rapid increase in the current demanded from the alternator, and a selector means (FF1) for, in this case, controlling the excitation with the aid of the said second control signal (V11) and thus progressively increasing the excitation of the alternator.

A circuit for regulating the voltage at which an alternator charges a battery,
in particular for a motor vehicle, the circuit being of the type comprising:


a signal generator (18, 20) for generating a sawtooth reference signal
(V1);
comparator means (12, FF2) for comparing said sawtooth reference
signal (V1) with a voltage (V2) proportional to the output voltage (B+) of the

alternator, and for generating a first control signal (V3) having a duty ratio that
varies as a function of the result of the comparison to cause excitation of the

alternator to vary;
counting means (26) for storing variable digital data;
digital second comparator means (22) for comparing a digital
comparison signal with said variable digital data, and for generating a second

control signal (V11) having a duty ratio that varies as a function of the result
of the comparison to vary the excitation of the alternator;
variable digital data control means (FF2, FF3, FF4, 24) acting on the
first and second control signals (V3, V11) to cause said variable digital data to

vary in correspondence with variations in the voltage (V2) proportional to the
output voltage (B+) of the alternator, but at a rate that is slower than the rate

at which said variations take place in the voltage (V2) in the event of a
sudden increase in current being demanded from the alternator and the

battery; and
selector means (FF1) for controlling excitation of the alternator with the
help of said second control signal (V11) in the event of such a sudden

increase in the current demanded from the alternator and the battery, thereby
causing excitation of the alternator to increase progressively;

the circuit being characterized in that:

said digital comparison signal is the same reference signal which, after
digital-to-analog conversion, serves as the sawtooth reference signal (V1),

and the control means (FF4, 24) comprise a logic circuit (FF2, FF3, FF4, I1)
suitable for comparing the duty ratios of the first and second signals (V3,

V11), and for delivering a signal as a function of said comparison, thereby
causing said second control signal (V11) to increase progressively.
A circuit according to claim 1, characterized in that said variable digital data
is suitable for varying over the same range and in the same direction as said

voltage (V2) proportional to the output voltage (B+) of the alternator. 
A circuit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the control means
(FF4, 24) are capable of causing the variable digital data to vary only after a

certain time period has elapsed after an increase in the current demand on
the alternator.
A circuit according to claim 3, characterized in that the control means (FF4,
24) further comprise an integrator circuit (24) suitable for causing the contents

of the counting means (26) to vary only after said logic circuit (FF4) has given
the same signal for a given number of regulation cycles.
A circuit according to claim 4, characterized in that said logic circuit (FF4)
comprises a bistable flip-flop and in that the integrator circuit (24) comprises a

shift register associated with a combinational logic circuit.
A circuit according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the rate
at which the variable digital data varies is determined as a function of the

rotation speed of the alternator.
A circuit according to claim 6, characterized in that the rate at which the
variable digital data varies in a direction corresponding to a reduction in the

output voltage from the alternator is slower than the rate at which said digital
data varies in the opposite direction.
A circuit according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that a clock input of a
second counting means (26) receives a clock signal derived from a phase

signal (îœ¤) of the alternator.
A circuit according to claims 7 and 8 taken in combination, characterized in
that a digital divider circuit (28) is provided having a control input for varying

its division ratio as a function of the output signal from the control means
(FF4, 24).
A circuit according to claim 9, characterized in that the division ratio is
unity when said variable digital data is varying in said opposite direction. 
A circuit according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the
selector means (FF1) provides an output signal constituted by that one of the

first and second control signals (V3, V11) that has the smaller duty ratio.
A circuit according to claim 11, characterized in that said selector means
comprises a bistable flip-flop (FF1) whose two reset inputs receive the output

signals from the two comparator means (12, 22).
