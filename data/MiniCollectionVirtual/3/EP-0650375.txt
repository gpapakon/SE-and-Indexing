<ABSTRACT>
Described is a suction device for cleaning the skin (5), the device having a suction nozzle with several openings (2) plus a gap (4). The skin (5) is drawn by a pulsating suction force (9) into the openings where it closes off the gap (4) in which a pulsating compression force (7), synchronized with the suction force (9), is generated. Comedones (3) are thus squeezed out of the pores (6) by short, variable compressive thrusts.

Method of operating a device for the cleaning of skin pores (6), 
with suction openings (2), in a given case with an elastic membrane 

(19) sketched over the suction openings, which are connected to means 
(9) for the generation of a, in particular, pulsating vacuum action 

on the skin pores (6), characterised thereby that a skin portion (5) 
with the skin pore (6) is initially sucked into the suction openings 

(2) of the cleaning device and made prominent and that then a 
pressure force is applied to the raised up skin pore from several 

sides in such a manner that a mechanical force surrounding the skin 
pore arises which acts in the interior of the skin pore (6), 

preferably in the direction of its longitudinal axis. 
Device for the cleaning of skin pores (6) with suction openings 
(2), in a given case with an elastic membrane (19) sketched over the 

suction openings, which are connected to means (9) for the generation 
of a, in particular, pulsating vacuum action on the skin pores (6), 

characterised thereby that the cleaning device comprises a suction 
nozzle, which is composed of two grating-like discs (1) placed one on 

the other and forming therebetween a bounded gap (4) which encloses 
the suction openings (2) and is connected to a pressure generator by 

means of a channel (8), wherein the narrow gap (4) is initially 
closable by skin (5) or a pore (6) drawn into the suction opening (2) 

arranged one above the other and is then feedable with pressure 
medium by the channel (8) in such a manner that in the region of the 

skin pore (6) raised up for treating this is surrounded by the 
pressure medium and the pressure effect in the interior of the skin 

pore (6) is preferably oriented in the direction of its longitudinal 
axis and acts from several sides. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised thereby that means 
for the building up of a preferably pulse-like pressure (7) are 

provided. 
Device for the cleaning of skin pores (6) with suction openings 
(2), in a given case with an elastic membrane (19) sketched over the  

 
suction openings, which are connected to means (9) for the generation 

of a, in particular, pulsating vacuum action on the skin pores (6), 
characterised thereby that at least one stationary jaw (16) and a jaw 

(12) movable in tongs-like manner are arranged at the suction nozzle 
for the production of a preferably mechanical pressure action in the 

lower region of the raised up skin pore (6), wherein the jaws (12, 
16) form therebetween a suction nozzle drawn out in slot-like manner 

in length. 
Device according to claim 4, characterised thereby that the 
suction nozzle is divided into individual suction openings by 

separating leaves (15). 
Device according to claim 4 or 5, characterised thereby that the 
jaws (12a, 12b) movable in tongs-like manner are connected into a 

unit by an articulated hinge. 
Device according to claim 4, 5 or 6, characterised thereby that 
the movable jaw part (12) is drivable by an electromagnet. 
Device according to claim 4, 5, 6 or 7, characterised thereby 
that the movable jaw part (12) is drivable by the pressure effect (7) 

of a slide pin (11). 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterised thereby that the 
pressure generator for the pressure generator in the gap (4) or in 

the suction chamber (13) is equipped with a liquid as pressure medium 
and preferably with water and comprises means for compensation for 

water loss. 
Device according to one or more of claims 2 to 9, characterised 
thereby that the pressure generator is formed with means for the 

dividing up of the pressure action into short pressure pulses and 
that the pressure generator can be synchronised with the means of the 

pulsating vacuum action. 
Device according to one or more of claims 2 to 10, characterised  
 

thereby that the pressure generator is formed with means for the 
dividing up of the pressure action into several pressure pulses (17) 

which follow one another at short intervals and which take place 
during only a suction pulse (18).
