<ABSTRACT>
A broach handle (10) for use with an orthopedic broach (38) includes 
an 

elongated handle (11) having one end portion (15) for making a connection 
with 

the broach (38) and another end portion (12) for gripping by the user 
and having 

an anvil (13) that allows the handle (10) to be hammered. A rotating 
locking 

member (30) is carried in a slot (25) at the distal end portion (15) 
of the handle (10). The 

rotating locking member (30) has inclined surfaces that allow the broach 
(38) to 

separate from the handle (10) when the inclined surface is positioned 
adjacent the broach (38). The rotating locking member (30) also includes 

a 
thickened portion that forms a connection with the broach (38) when 

positioned adjacent the broach (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to broach handles for use in 
orthopedic implant surgery. A broach is used during hip arthroplasty. The surgeon uses the 
broach to prepare the inner surfaces of the intramedullary canal of the 
patient to receive a femoral hip prosthesis. This preparation of the 
intramedullary canal by the surgeon is designed to ensure a proper fit 
between the patient's femur and the prosthesis. Various types of 
broach handles have been patented. Examples are shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,306,550 entitled "Combination Including Femoral Rasp 
and Calcar Facing Reamer", U.S. Patent No. 4,583,270 entitled "Rasp 
Handle", U.S. Patent No. 4,601,289 entitled "Femoral Trial 
Prosthesis/Rasp Assembly", and U.S. Patent No. 4,990,149 entitled 
"Releasable Orthopedic Broach Handle Apparatus". The present invention provides an improved broach handle 
apparatus for use with an orthopedic broach that can be used to 
prepare a patient's femur to receive a hip implant. The handle is for 
use with a broach that has a tapered roughened end portion and an 
upper end having a connector that is adapted to engage the handle in 
a removable fashion. According to the present invention there is provided a broach 
handle apparatus for use with an orthopedic broach for preparation of 
a bone to receive an implant, the broach including a tapered 
roughened portion and an upper end portion with a connector adapted 
to engage the handle, comprising: 
a) an elongated handle body portion having a first 
end portion with a connection end adapted for connecting to an upper 
end portion of the broach, and a second portion adapted to be gripped 
by the user; b) a socket disposed at the first end portion of the 
handle body for receiving a portion of the broach thereunto; c) a slot positioned at the distal end of the handle body 
and in communication with the socket;  d) rotary means rotatably disposed within the slot for 
forming a connection between the handle and a broach, the rotating 
member having a release surface portion that allows the broach to be 
separated from the handle when the release surface is positioned in 
the socket and adjacent the broach. The broach handle apparatus may have a rotary locking 
mechanism for locking the broach to the handle, and wherein the 
rotary locking member has radially spaced apart locking and release 
portions so that rotation of the locking member alternatively locks or 
releases the broach from the handle. A rotary disk can be disposed upon a spindle within the slot for 
forming
