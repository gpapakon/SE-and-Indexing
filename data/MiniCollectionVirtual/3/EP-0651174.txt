<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a controllable oscillation damper for motor vehicles, comprising a damper cylinder (33) which is filled with damping fluid, in which a damping piston (36) connected to a piston rod (37) and provided with pressure-dependent valves (34,35) for the tension and compression stages slides, the said piston dividing the damper cylinder into two working spaces (39,40), and which is provided with a controllable outer damping-valve system (6) for setting the damping force of the oscillation damper. In conjunction with the pressure-dependent valves (34,35) on the damping piston (33), the damping-valve system permits four characteristics for the damping force in the tension and compression stages and has two damping valves (2), each comprising a pressure-dependent valve (7,8) and an electromagnetically controllable control spool (9,10) which interacts with at least one opening (3,4) and can be moved axially. The damping valves (2) are arranged coaxially with respect to one another in an essentially cylindrical valve housing (5) and can be connected to one another via flow passages. According to the invention, at least one of the flow connections (14,15) for the damping fluid is routed axially into the damping system (6) via the end (16,17) of the valve housing (15). The advantage of the damping-valve system is, in particular, that it can be arranged at points in the vehicle at which the known damping-valve system cannot be used for reasons of space.

Adjustable vibration damper for motor vehicles consisting of a damping cylinder
(33) filled with damping fluid, in which damping cylinder slides a damping piston (36)

which is connected to a piston rod (37) and provided with pressure-dependent valves
(34;35) for the pull and push stage, which damping piston partitions the damping

cylinder (33) into two working chambers (39;40) and the said damping piston being
provided with an adjustable outer damping valve system (6) for the purpose of adjusting

the damping force of the vibration damper, which damping valve system in conjunction
with the pressure dependent valves (34;35) at the damping piston (36) of the vibration

damper renders it possible in the pull and push stage to produce four characteristic
curves of the damping force, wherein the damping valve system (6) provided with at

least two flow connections (14;15) comprises damping valves (2) which consist in each
case of a pressure-dependent valve (7,8) for the pull and push stage and in each case

an electro-magnetically controllable, axially displaceable control slide (9;10) which
cooperates with at least one orifice (3;4), wherein the damping valves (2) are disposed

in a coaxial manner with respect to each other in a substantially cylindrical valve
housing (5) and are interconnected by way of flow ducts (1), 
characterised in that
 the
damping valve system (6) comprises for the damping fluid two axial flow connections

(14;15) which extend in parallel with the axis of the damping cylinder (33) and which are
routed via the respective end face (16;17) of the valve housing (5) in an axial manner

into the damping valve system (6) and that each of the electromagnets (11) which move
the control slides (9;10) is penetrated in an axial central manner by the respective flow

connection (14;15) and/or one flow duct (30) connected to the respective flow
connection (14,15) or is encompassed in an axial peripheral manner by an annular duct

for the purpose of carrying the damping fluid.
Vibration damper according to claim 1, characterised in that one of the flow
connections (14) comprises a direct connection to one of the pressure-dependent

valves (7) and to one of the controlled orifices (3) and the further flow connection (15) 
comprises a direct connection to the further pressure-dependent valve (8) and to the

further controlled orifice (4).
Vibration damper according to any one of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that the
electro-magnetically controllable, axially displaceable control slides (9;10) which

cooperate with at least one orifice (3;4) are disposed axially outside and the pressure-dependent
valves (7;8) are disposed axially inside in the valve housing (5).
Vibration damper according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
electromagnetically controllable control slides (9;10) which cooperate with at least one

controlled orifice (3;4) are disposed axially inside and the pressure-dependent valves
(7;8) are disposed axially outside in the valve housing (5).
