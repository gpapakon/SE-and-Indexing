<ABSTRACT>
A machine (10) applies carrier stock (12) of resilient 
polymeric material to substantially identical containers 

(14), each having an upper rim (20) of a given diameter and 
a side wall (22) of a larger diameter. The carrier stock 

(12) has container-receiving apertures (18) in longitudinal 
rows. A conveyor (30of Figure 1) conveys the containers 

(14) in longitudinal rows. A wheel assembly (40) 
comprising two wheels (42,44) with paired jaws (52,54) 

receives the stock (12), stretches it transversely, and 
moves the stock (12) downwardly past the rims (20). The 

conveyor (30), the wheel assembly (40), and the jaws (52) 
on one wheel (42) are adjustable for applying the stock 

(12) selectively in a rim-applied carrier position or in a 
side-applied carrier position. The conveyor (30) is 

supported by a table (102, Figure 7) and is adjustable 
vertically, via spacers (130) insertable between the table 

(102) and a base (112). The wheel assembly (40) is 
adjustable longitudinally, via rollers (172) on 

longitudinal rails (166). The jaws (52) on one wheel (42) 
are adjustable transversely, via screws (80,90).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to an improved machine for 
applying carrier stock to substantially identical 
containers, such as beverage cans, of a type having an 
upper rim of a given diameter and a side wall of a 
larger diameter. A machine for applying carrier stock to 
substantially identical containers, such as beverage 
cans, of the type noted above and having the features of the 
preamble of claim 1, is exemplified in Braun 
U.S. Patent No. 4,250,682. The carrier stock applied 
by such a machine is of a type made, as by die cutting, 
from a single sheet of resilient polymeric material, 
such as low density polyethylene, so as to have band 
segments defining container-receiving apertures in 
longitudinal rows. As exemplified in the Braun patent noted above, 
the machine comprises a conveyor for conveying the 
containers longitudinally, in longitudinal rows. 
Moreover, the machine comprises a wheel assembly 
rotatable on a transverse axis. The wheel assembly 
includes a first wheel and a second wheel spaced 
transversely from the first wheel. The first and 
second wheels have jaws in transversely opposed pairs, 
each pair including a first jaw mounted to the first  
 
wheel in a fixed position and a second jaw mounted to 
the second wheel so as to be transversely movable 
toward and away from the first jaw of such pair. The 
jaws are used for receiving the carrier stock, 
stretching the carrier stock transversely as the second 
jaws are moved away from the first jaws, and moving the 
carrier stock downwardly past the upper rims of the 
containers as the wheel assembly is rotated and the 
containers are conveyed past the rotating assembly. After the carrier stock has been applied to the 
containers, the carrier stock is severed transversely 
into individual carriers, each carrying a small number 
of the containers (e.g., six containers) in a 
rectangular array. Commonly, the rectangular array has 
two longitudinal rows and three transverse ranks. The 
rectangular array may have a different arrangement, 
such as three longitudinal rows and two transverse 
ranks. As illustrated and described in the Braun patent 
noted above, the machine is used to apply the carrier 
stock to the containers in a rim-applied carrier 
position, in which the carrier stock engages the 
containers near the upper rims. Also, generally 
similar machines are known for applying carrier stock 
to such containers in a side-applied carrier position, 
in which the carrier stock engages the containers along 
the side walls. Such machines

<CLAIMS>
A machine (10) for applying carrier stock (12) to 
substantially identical containers (14) in a rectangular 

array, the carrier stock (12) being of a type made from 
resilient polymeric material with band segments (16) 

defining container-receiving apertures (18) in a 
rectangular array, each container (14) being of a type 

having an upper rim (20) of a given diameter and a side 
wall (22) of a larger diameter, the machine (10) comprising 


(a) means (30) for conveying the containers (14) 
longitudinally, in longitudinal rows, and 
(b) means (40) for applying the carrier stock (12) to 
the containers (14) by receiving the carrier stock (12), 

stretching the carrier stock (12) transversely, and moving 
the carrier stock (12) downwardly past the upper rims (20) 

of the containers (14) as the containers are conveyed, 
characterised by 
(c) means (57,80,90,130,164,166,168) for adjusting 
relative positions of the conveying (30) and applying (40) 

means so as to enable the applying means (40) optionally to 
apply the carrier stock (12) to the containers (14) in one 

of two positions, namely in a rim-applied carrier position, 
in which the carrier stock (12) engages the containers (14) 

near their upper rims (20), or in a side-applied carrier 
position, in which the carrier stock (12) engages the 

containers along the side walls (22).
