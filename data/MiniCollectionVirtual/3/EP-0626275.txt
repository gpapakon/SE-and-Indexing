<ABSTRACT>
Plasticized safety document provided with a passport photo, 
such as admission passes, bank passes, credit cards, should 

be fraud proof as good as possible. According to the invention, 
a passport photo having knurled or toothed edges is 

used. Such a safety document can be obtained e.g. by applying 
a passport photo onto a document of cardboard or plastic 

provided with identification particulars, and subsequently 
cutting out the passport photo with a passport photo cutter, 

provided with a cutting window having knurled edges, and 
inserting the knurled passport photo (2') with knurled edge 

(3'), cut to the appropriate size, into the likewise knurled 
opening (4') formed in the document by cutting-out. This 

assembly is laminated on two sides with polyester sheet (5) 
provided with an adhesive layer by means of hot-pressing. 

Thus, one obtains a safety document that meets the highest 
requirements of protection against fraud, and from which the 

passport photo can not be removed undamaged on opening the 
lamination. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to insert 

a new passport photo, because it should have the appropriate 
knurl pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a plasticized safety document provided with
a passport photograph having toothed and/or knurled edges.Safety documents in the sense of the present invention are
understood to mean strictly personal identification documents such as
admission passes, bank passes, credit cards, and the like, as well as
documents issued by the central government such as identity cards,
passports, driving licences, etc. In order to protect such documents,
which are intended for strictly personal use, against forgery, they
are plasticized, that is, laminated with a laminate of thermosetting
plastic material. In the usual practice the relevant document,
consisting of printed paper, cardboard, or plastic material, is
provided with a passport photograph and subsequently enclosed by two
transparant protective sheets of thermosetting polyester material,
each being provided with a thin adhesive layer of thermoplastic
material, whereupon this entity is laminated by hot-pressing.Such a plasticized safety document is primarily protected against
forgery, but does not exclude it completely. For example, an
experienced forger will be able to open the laminate again with the
help of a hot iron, and change the particulars on the document, e.g.
by forging a signature or applying another passport photograph, and 
subsequently laminating the forged document again. In order to make
the protection against fraud as high as possible, according to the
earlier Dutch patent application No. 92 01772, likewise of applicant,
and not pre-published, it is suggested to laminate the document with
multi-layer laminates, as a result of which the act of opening such a
laminated document is seriously complicated, and the risk of damages
is highly increased.Still the problem remains, that the most vulnerable part of the
document is a passport photograph. If a person succeeds in opening
the laminate undamaged, it is relatively easy to remove a normal
passport photograph without damage and replace it by another one.In order to make removal and replacement of passport photographs as
difficult as possible, it is already proposed to provide the edges of
a passport photograph with a crenature.In DE-A-3,233,678 a plasticized safety document is described
comprising a passport photograph having rounded toothed edges and
which is inserted in a matching recess in the document wherein the
inner edges of the recess have counter-teeth in which the teeth of
the edges of the passport photograph match. The advantage of such an
embodiment is, that the

<CLAIMS>
A plasticized (5) safety document (1) provided with a passport
photograph (2) having toothed and/or knurled edges (3'),
characterized in that,

the passport photograph edges (3') are toothed and/or knurled
according to a special coding pattern for authenticity

identification.
A plasticized safety document according to claim 1,
characterized in that,

the passport photograph (2') has at least one character edge, in
which the teeth or knurls form characters for indication of use.
A method for manufacturing a plasticized safety document
according to claim 1 or 2, of the type in which the passport

photograph is inserted in a matching recess in the document, in which
method a document provided with a passport photograph is laminated on

two sides with plastic sheets having their inner sides provided with
a thermoplastic adhesive layer,
characterized in that,

a passport photograph, not yet cut to the appropriate size, is put on
the destined place on the document, is cut out in the appropriate

size and with a knurled edge, together with the underlying part of
the document, then the cut-out photograph is inserted into the

opening formed in the document, and is laminated together with the
document.
