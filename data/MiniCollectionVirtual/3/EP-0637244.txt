<ABSTRACT>
Avermectin compounds are glycosylated at the 4',13- Or 14a-positions by adding the avermectin compounds to the fermentation medium of a novel strain of Streptomyces avermitilis. The 4'-hydroxy, 13-hydroxy and 14a-hydroxy methyl groups of the avermectin compound are glycosylated with a glycosyl moiety, specifically an oleandrose group. The new strain offers the added advantage of not producing any C5-O-methylation products. The compounds are potent anthelmintic and antiparasite agents, and compositions for such uses are also disclosed. U.S patent 3950360 to Aoki e

<DESCRIPTION>
Avermectin compounds are natural products
produced by the fermentation of Streptomyces
avermitilis as disclosed in U.S. 4,310,519 to
Albers-Schonberg et al. The avermectin compounds
have a natural α-L-oleandrosyl-α-L-oleandrosyloxy
group at the 13-position. In U.S. Patent 4,203,976
to Fischer etal certain synthetic procedures are
disclosed for glycosylating various hydroxy groups or
the avermectin molecule, including the 4"-hydroxy of
the avermectin disaccharide group but not the
14a-position. U.S. Patent 3,950,360 to Aoki et al
discloses milbemycin compounds and European patent
application 242,052 to Rudd et al discloses
nemadectin compounds with a 23-hydroxy group and a
25-unsaturated alkyl group. US 5192671 discloses glycosylation of the 4'
and 4" positions of avermectin compounds by adding the compounds to the
fermentation medium of Saccharapolyspora erythrea. The outer
oleandrose sugar group of the avermectin compounds is glycosylated with
a glycosyl moiety, specifically a glucose group. In addition, other changes
are effected in the avermectin moiety such as selective hydroxylation,
epimerization at the 2-carbon and migration of the Δ 3-double bond to a Δ
2-position. This invention is concerned with the
preparation of avermectin compounds with a glycosyl
group, specifically an oleandrosyl group, substituted
at the 13- and 14a-positions of the avermectin
compounds without formation of a 5-methoxy group
which are prepared by fermenting an avermectin
aglycone or a 14a-hydroxy avermectin compound in a
culture medium of a novel strain of Streptomyces
avermitilis MA 6941, ATCC 55292. The compounds
produced by the fermentation are potent antiparasitic
and anthelmintic agents.This invention is concerned with the
preparation of avermectin compounds where an
oleandrosyl group is placed at the 4', 13- and
14a-positions of an avermectin compound. The process
is carried out by culturing the microorganism
Streptomycesavermitilis in a culture medium and
adding the avermectin monosaccharide, aglycone or the
14a-hydroxy avermectin starting material to the
fermentation broth. The culture Streptomyces
avermitilis is a new microorganism that has been
deposited with the American Type Culture Collection
at 12301 Parklawn Dr. Rockville, MD 20852 under the
accession number ATCC 55292. The deposit was made
under the Budapest Treaty for the deposit of
microorganisms for patent purposes on 55292.The strain of Streptomycesavermitilis
MA 6941 is a novel mutant strain that does not
produce any avermectin compounds in the
