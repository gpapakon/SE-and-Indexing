<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sliding 
member formed of a synthetic resin composed mainly of a 

polyethylene, said sliding member comprising a molded 
piece of a polyethylene having a viscosity-average 

molecular weight of 500,000 to 6,000,000 inclusive, 
having a low coefficient of friction and excelling in 

both its own wear resistance and its property of 
preventing the abrasion of an associated member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an injection mold assembly for injection
molding molded parts of a polyethylene having a molecular weight of
500,000 to 6,000,000.Heretofore, various materials have been used for
guides for movable systems for magnetic tapes such as VTR
and cassette tapes. For instance, known organic
materials involve polyoxymethylene (POM for short) which
are used alone or in combination with a fluororesin and
even silicone. Some plastic parts contain carbon so as to
release charges generated by frictional contact with the
surface of a tape, since plastics tend to be electrified.
Known inorganic materials include metals and ceramics,
while known metallic guides are formed of stainless
materials or brass plated on its surface with nickel or
chromium.Such guides as mentioned above operate in two
manners, according to one of which they rotate in
association with the travelling of a tape. According to
another, they are fixed relative to the travelling of a
tape. In most cases, the fixed type of metallic guides
are used for portions through which a tape travels under
relatively increased tape tension with increased changes
in the direction of its movement.Some problems with such conventional guides
originate from the properties of the materials used and
some arise from the processing techniques applied.Of noteworthy in connection with the materials used
is that in view of the principles of friction or
tribology, a material of larger momentum should basically
be harder than its associated material of smaller
momentum. In other words, a tape's material should
fundamentally be harder than its associated guide. Under 
such conditions, the amount of abrasion is considered to
be minimized.In view of tribology, however, the material used for
the conventional guides is totally reversed in
combination or not in ideal conditions at all. More
specifically, the POM that is a polymeric material used
for guides is much harder than PET that is a base film of
magnetic tapes. In addition, stainless or chromium-plated
brass materials used for fixed guides are harder
than the POM. This implies that if guides become
irregular even slightly on their surfaces, then magnetic
tapes will be likely to be damaged.To avoid this problem, the surfaces of guides over
which tapes travel, i.e., in contact with them, are now
polished into mirror surfaces to increase the area of
their surfaces in contact with the tapes, thereby
applying local contact pressure to the tapes for the
purpose of preventing the travelling

<CLAIMS>
An injection mold assembly for injection molding molded parts of a polyethylene
having a molecular weight of 500,000 to 6,000,000 inclusive,

which includes a compression piece (116) slidably located in a cavity and
means (118) for energizing said compression piece (116) and in which

when said compression piece (116) is retracted by a resin-filling pressure,
said means (118) generates a reaction compression force with respect to

said resin pressure to compress the resin filled in the cavity with a pressure
corresponding to the volume of the resin filled, and which further includes

a gate cutting piece (117) slidably located in said compression piece (116).
