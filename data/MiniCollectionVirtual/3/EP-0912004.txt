<ABSTRACT>
When a route hub(RH) receives device data synchronized
with a device reference clock set in a source device connected

to the route hub(RH) from the source device(N), the route
hub(RH) modulates the device data to communication data

synchronized with a transmission reference clock; adds a
phase information to be used to demodulate the modulated

communication data into the device data, to an empty area which
is equivalent to a difference between a number of bits of each

unit block of the device data and a number of bits of each
unit block of the communication data synchronized with the

transmission reference clock, at the time of the modulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication system
constructed by interconnecting a plurality of repeaters each
having one or more devices connected thereto by a data
transmission line and particularly to a communication method
and a communication system capable of truly and precisely
transmitting digital data from an input device to an output
device having a different sampling rate from that of the input
device.In recent years, digital audio equipment for recording
and reproducing digitized characters, voice, image data or
the like, such as CD (Compact Disk) drives, CD-ROM drives and
DAT (Digital Audio Tape-recorder) units, have been rapidly
widespread.To record and reproduce original digital data (to be
referred to as "original data" hereinafter) truly and
precisely, a sampling rate is set in each of these digital
audio equipment.A sampling rate of 44.1 kHz is used for CD drives, 32,
44.1 or 48 kHz for DAT units, 32 kHz for RDS (Radio Data System)
units which provide character information service and
automatic broadcast reception service by FM multiplex
broadcasting, 44.1 kHz for digital audio amplifiers
incorporating a DSP (Digital Signal Processor), and 44.1 or
48 kHz for MD (Mini Disc) drives.There may be a request for transferring digital data
from an output unit having a relatively low sampling rate to
an input unit having a relatively high sampling rate, for 
example, transferring original data from an RDS unit having
a sampling rate of 32 kHz to a digital audio amplifier having
a sampling rate of 48 kHz to output voice, or transferring
original data from a CD drive having a sampling rate of 44.1
kHz to an MD drive having a sampling rate of 48 kHz to be
recorded.In this case, it is conceivable to interpose an
interface between the input unit and the output unit to carry
out the processing of matching the sampling rates of these
units.That is, as a first method, interpolation is carried
out on the original data, thereby making it possible to
exchange digital data between input and output units having
different sampling rates. As a second method, original data
from an output unit is stored in a transmission buffer using
a FIFO (First-In First-Out) system, DMA (Direct Memory
Access) system or the like, the stored digital data is
transmitted at a predetermined bit rate higher than the
sampling rate of an input unit, the digital data received at
this predetermined bit rate is stored in a receiving buffer,
and the stored digital data is transmitted to the input unit
at a transmission bit rate
