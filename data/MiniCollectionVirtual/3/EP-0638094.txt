<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for concentrating aqueous 
fluoropolymer dispersions, such as dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. Concentrated fluoropolymer dispersions of higher weight percent than 
those obtained directly from polymerization are preferred in uses such as the 
coating of glass fabric, because fewer coatings are required to build the 
necessary thickness of fluoropolymer. Concentrated aqueous fluoropolymer 
dispersions are also preferred in uses such as the coating of metals and 
circuit boards. Such dispersions are also used to make films. Various techniques are known for providing concentrated 
fluoropolymer dispersion, but all suffer from one or more disadvantages. 
Concentration of polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions to greater than 25 wt% 
is disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,478,229. The action of naturally derived 
substances such as ammonium alginate, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, 
and derivatives of cellulose to concentrate dispersions of perfluorohaloolefin 
polymers is disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,878,196 to Buffington and U.S. Patent 
3,778,391 to Morris et al. The concentration method which enjoys the widest commercial use is 
disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,037, 953; 3,301,807 and 3,704,272. The technique 
involves the addition of non-ionic surfactants such as ethoxylated alkyl 
phenols or ethoxylated aliphatic alcohols to a fluoropolymer dispersion 
obtained directly from polymerization. The resulting mixture is heated 
above its cloud point, which causes it to separate into upper and lower 
phases. The upper phase contains a significant portion of the non-ionic 
surfactant, making environmentally acceptable disposal of this phase 
expensive. The large amount of non-ionic surfactant needed, typically 3 wt% 
or greater based on polymer solids, is expensive. For some applications, the 
use of lower amounts of non-ionic surfactant would provide benefits to the 
end product, such as a more desirable color or ease of manufacture.  
 The present invention involves the discovery of a process which 
substantially overcomes the disadvantages discussed above. The pH of the 
dispersion obtained from polymerization is adjusted, if necessary, to a pH of 
about 6 or greater. Typically, a base such as ammonium hydroxide is used. 
To this mixture is added an acrylic polymer concentrating agent having an 
acid content of 20% or more by weight and a weight-average molecular 
weight of about 50,000 to about 500,000, in an amount from about 0.01 wt% 
to about 0.5 wt %, based on the weight of

<CLAIMS>
A process for concentrating aqueous fluoropolymer 
dispersions, which process comprises 


a) providing a fluoropolymer dispersion having a pH of about 6 or 
greater; 
b) adding to the dispersion at least one concentrating agent 
selected from the group consisting of polyacrylic acid, a 

polyacrylate salt, an acrylic polymer of 20 wt% acid content or 

more, and a salt of an acrylic polymer of 20 wt% acid content 
or more, said concentrating agent having a weight average 

molecular weight from about 50,000 to about 500,000, in an 
amount such that the resulting mixture contains 0.01 to 0.5 

weight percent of the concentrating agent based on the 
aqueous content of the mixture; 
c) allowing concentration to proceed, whereby an upper and a 
lower phase are obtained; and 
d) separating the upper and the lower phases. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the fluoropolymer is a 
homopolymer, copolymer, terpolymer or tetrapolymer comprising an 

ethylenically unsaturated monomer containing at least one fluorine atom. 
The process of Claim 2 wherein the fluoropolymer comprises 
tetrafluoroethylene. 
The process of Claim 3 wherein the fluoropolymer is 
polytetrafluoroethylene or tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoro(propyl vinyl) ether 

copolymer or fluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer. 
The process of Claim 4 wherein the fluoropolymer is 
polytetrafluoroethylene. 
The process of Claim 5 wherein the concentrating agent is 
polyacrylic acid. 
The process of Claim 1 further comprising adding to the 
dispersion, before or with the concentrating agent, a stabilizing agent 

selected from the group consisting of non-ionic surfactants, ionic surfactants, 
polyalcohols, and mixtures thereof, such that the dispersion contains 0.05 to 

12 wt% of the stabilizing agent, based on the polymer solids content of the 
resulting mixture.  

 
The process of Claim 1 further comprising a step (e) wherein a 
non-ionic or ionic surfactant is added to the lower phase of step (d) in an 

amount equal to about 1 to about 12 weight percent based on the aqueous 
content of the lower phase. 
Coating or film obtained from the lower phase made by the process 
of Claim 1. 
The process of Claim 8 wherein said surfactant present in said 
lower phase is present solely by addition of said lower phase.
