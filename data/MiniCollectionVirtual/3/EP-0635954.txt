<ABSTRACT>
A transmission-reception circuit, including a 
transmitter circuit (D) and a receiver circuit (R) 

connected to each end of a transmission line (L), for 
transmitting and receiving a signal (SRA1, SRB1) to 

another receiver circuit (R) and from another transmitter 
circuit (D) at the other end across the transmission 

line, wherein in order to enable logical decision on a 
receiving signal to be made accurately and secure high 

reliability in a fully duplex simultaneous two-way 
communication, power supply lines are laid at opposite 

ends of the transmission line and threshold voltages 
(VTH1, VTH2, VTH3) for logical decision on a signal 

received by the receiver circuit are supplied from a 
power unit (PSA, PSB) used for the transmitter circuit 

and the receiver circuit at the other end of the 
transmission line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transmission-reception
system including a transmitter circuit and a
receiver circuit connected to each end of a transmission
line.As the transmission-reception circuit for
transferring digital signals between two devices
connected to opposite ends of a transmission line, those
disclosed in JP-A-56-98052, JP-A-3-186033, JP-A-2-50537,
JP-A-51-64811, and U.S. Patent No. 4,899,332 are
heretofore well known.The transmission-reception circuit disclosed in
JP-A-56-98052 (title of the invention : baseband two-way
simultaneous transmission circuit) is capable of fully
duplex communication on a transmission line, which was
made possible by connecting outputs of the transmitter
circuits in the communication devices to the opposite
communication devices through resistances and a transmission
line, inputting as reference inputs of comparators
the voltages obtained by combining the outputs of the
transmitter circuits, divided by voltage-divider
resistances, with the reference voltages, inputting the
received signal from the other device as a comparative
input to the comparator, and detecting changes in level 
of the signal received from the other device with the
comparator regardless of the signal from the device at
this end.The transmission-reception circuit disclosed in
JP-A-3-186033 (title of invention : signal transmission
system) is capable of fully duplex communication on a
transmission line, made possible by, after combining
signals from a set of opposing transmitters by a signal
synthesizer, separating the transmitting signal by this
device and the transmitting signal by the other device
from the composite signal, and extracting the transmitting
signal sent by the other device by removing only
this device's own transmitting signal from the signals
separated as described.The transmission-reception circuit disclosed in
JP-A-2-50537 (title of invention : two-way simultaneous
communication system) is capable of fully duplex communication
on a transmission line, made possible by having
the devices at opposite ends of a communication line
provided with a driver circuit and a receiver circuit
formed based on the same reference, generating threshold
values and desired output voltages corresponding to
high-level or low-level input signals by setting supply
voltages and resistances, and discriminating the signal
level of the other device by comparing the output
voltages with the corresponding threshold values with the
comparators of the receiver circuits at the opposite
ends. The
