<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a post/crossmember system, having   - posts (1) which, on an outer side, are provided on the border with a first sealing strip (2) which is mounted in a U-shaped groove (3) exhibiting a rear-engagement cross-section, - crossmembers (4) which are to be arranged transversely with respect to the posts (1) and adjoin the posts (1) on the end sides in each case, the crossmembers (4), on the outer side, being provided on the border with a second sealing strip (5) and exhibiting an end-side notch (6) for bearing on the posts (1), wherein - the crossmembers (4) are provided with a first planar outer region (7) on which there are formed projecting retaining webs (8) exhibiting a mushroom-shaped cross-section, - the thickness of the first sealing strip (2) is essentially equal to the thickness of the second sealing strip (5) and the planar outer region (7), - longitudinal members (9), which are to be arranged essentially parallel to the post (1), exhibit a second planar outer region (8) which bears third sealing strips (11) on the border, - the longitudinal members (9) are provided with an end-side notch (12) for bearing on the respective crossmembers (4), and - the thickness of the second outer region (10) plus the third sealing strip is essentially equal to the thickness of the second sealing strip (5).

Mullion-transom system comprising:

mullions (1) which on an outside at the edge are provided with a first
sealing strip (2) which is supported in a U-shaped groove (3) of a

relief cross-section;
transverse transoms (4) which are to be arranged in a direction
transverse to the mullions (1), the transverse mullions (4) being

provided on the outside at the edge with a second sealing strip (5);
longitudinal transoms (9) which are to be arranged substantially in
parallel with the mullions (1) and comprise a second planar outer

portion (10) carrying third sealing strips (11) at the edge;
the transverse transoms (4) being provided with a first planar outer
portion (7) which has formed thereon projecting holding bars (8) for

anchoring the second sealing strip (5),
the thickness of the first sealing strip (2) between the support planes
thereof being substantially equal to the thickness of the second

sealing strip (5) between the support planes thereof and the planar
outer portion (7),

characterized in that

the transverse transoms (5) at their respective front sides adjoin the
mullions (1) and comprise a front recess for support on the mullions

(1), wherein in the installed state in the case of the front recess of the
transverse transom (4) the first outer portion (7) is placed on the

groove (3) of the mullion (1), 
the holding bar (8) of the transverse transoms (4) has a mushroomshaped
cross-section,
the longitudinal transoms (9) are provided with a front recess (12) for
support on the respective transverse transoms (4), wherein in the

installed state in the case of the front recess of the longitudinal
transom (9) the second outer portion (10) is placed on the outer

portion (7) of the transverse transom (4) after the holding bar (8) has
been removed, and
the thickness of the second outer portion (10) plus the third sealing
strip (11) between the support planes thereof is substantially equal to

the thickness of the second sealing strip (5).
The mullion-transom system according to claim 1, characterized in that the
third sealing strip (11) is glued to the second outer portion (10).
The mullion-transom system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the mullion (1), the transverse transom (4) and the longitudinal transom (9)

are each formed as a hollow section.
The mullion-transom system according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that in the central portion of the mullion (1), the transverse

transom (4) and the longitudinal transom (9), two anchoring grooves (13),
which are in parallel with each other, are respectively formed for holding

therein thermal dividing bars (14) for supporting a holding section (15) of the
mullion (1), the transverse transom (4) and the longitudinal transom (9),

respectively.
The mullion-transom system according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the sealing strip (2, 5, 11) is provided with an

elastically deformable, outwardly oriented outer lip (16). 
The mullion-transom system according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that
the sealing strip (2, 5, 11) is provided with an elastically deformable,

inwardly oriented inner lip (17) which can be placed on the anchoring
groove.
