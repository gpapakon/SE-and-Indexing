<ABSTRACT>
A controller having an up/down switch for changing the 
rotational speed of a prime mover such as an engine, an actuator 

such as an electric motor for driving a governor on the basis of 
the operation of the up/down switch so as to control the 

rotational speed of the prime mover. A target speed is calculated 
on the basis of the operation of the up/down switch, and the 

prime mover speed is controlled by using the calculated value. 
Another switch is provided to immediately shift the prime mover 

speed to a speed previously set as desired. This shift switch is 
used to control the prime mover so that the prime mover rotates 

at the set speed, and this speed is adjusted by operating the 
up/down switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for controlling
the rotational speed of a prime mover of a construction
machine, having a hydraulic pump driven by the prime mover,
an actuator driven by oil discharged from said hydraulic pump
and operating means for controlling the operation of said
actuator, said apparatus comprising: a prime mover controller
that controls the rotational speed of the prime mover; a
drive actuator that receives a driving signal from a control
circuit to drive said prime mover controller; a command
signal output device that outputs a command signal to vary
the rotational speed of the prime mover; and a control
circuit that receives said command signal output from said
command operation signal output device and produces said
driving signal on the basis of the received command signal.Such a rotational speed control apparatus is known from
WO-A-88/02441, which known apparatus comprises a first
revolution setting means and a second revolution setting
means, which co-operate in such a way, that the rotational
speed of the prime mover, an engine, is determined by the
setting of said first revolution setting means as long as the
position of the second revolution setting means remains below
a value which represents a predetermined position and is 
determined by the setting of said second revolution setting
means when the position thereof exceeds said value.From Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 61-145849 a
prime mover speed controller is known which is capable of 
remote-controlling an engine governor. This controller
transmits a value which represents the operation of an
operational section to an operational value detector through a
link or the like to obtain a command signal corresponding to
the operational value. This command signal is transmitted to a
control circuit which controls a motor which rotates to drive
the governor.Since this type of apparatus necessitates the provision
of an operational value detector (e.g., potentiometer or pulse
encoder) for detecting the value representing the operation of
the operational section, it entails the following problems.
1. It is necessary to correct the output from the
operational value detector by the control circuit because the
linearity of the output from the operational value detector
with respect to the operational value is not sufficiently
high.2. A component such as a link for connecting the operating
section and the operational value detector is needed. The
number of component parts is thereby increased and the
resulting structure
