<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation 
of antibiotic substances belonging to the cephalosporin class of 
compounds. More specifically, the present invention relates to a new 
process for the preparation of cefotaxime, cefetamet, and ceftriaxone 
sodium. The latter compounds belong to a known class of valuable 
cephalosporanic antibiotics disclosed, for example, in U.S. 4,098,888 
(1978) as well as numerous other patents and other publications. This 
class of antibiotics is characterized by the presence of an oximino group 
and a 2-aminothiazolyl heterocyclic ring in the 7-acylamido side-chain 
attached to the cephalosporin nucleus. This class of compounds is also 
characterized by suitable substituents at the 3-position of the 
cephalosporin nucleus. It is known that the oximino group in the 
7-acylamido side-chain may have the syn or anti configuration, but that 
the syn isomers have higher antibiotic activity. See, e.g., U.S. 
4,152,432 (1979) and U.S. 4,224,371 (1980). Conventionally, this class of compounds is prepared by first 
introducing the suitable substituent into the 3-position of the 
cephalosporin nucleus, and then attaching the suitable substituent to the  
 
nitrogen in the 7-position. Thus, U.S. 4,767,852 (1988) discloses a 
process for the production of known 2-oximinoacetamido-3-cephem-4-carboxylic 
acid derivatives, including cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, by 
acylating 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid derivatives already 
substituted at the 3-position with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetate, 
the latter often being referred 
to as MAEM. Similarly, U.S. 5,026,843 (1991) discloses a process for 
preparing ceftriaxone disodium salt hemiheptahydrate. As the first step 
in the process disclosed in that patent, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) 
already suitably substituted at the 3-position is acylated at the 
7-position using MAEM as the acylating agent. Thus, MAEM has become the 
standard acylating agent for the preparation of cephalosporins having an 
oximino group and a 2-aminothioazolyl group in the 7-acylamido side-chain. However, there are certain disadvantages to using MAEM as the 
acylating agent. In particular, a by-product of this reaction is the 
toxic compound 2-mercaptobenzothiazole. See, e.g., 
Chemical Abstracts111, 
19243p (1989). Therefore, there has been an ongoing search for new 
acylating agents which are capable of introducing the 2-aminothiazolyl 
group as part of the 7-acylamido side-chain in
