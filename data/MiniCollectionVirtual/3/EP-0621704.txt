<ABSTRACT>
To solve the problem raised by the allocation of synchronous 
bandwidth on a FDDI segment when this allocation 

is done by a centralized Allocator in an interconnected 
LAN domain, a Third Party Requestor receives from Quality 

of Service Allocator all information that it needs to ask 
for bandwidth reservation on the FDDI segment. Following 

the Station Management standard , the Third Party Requestor 
is able to act on behalf of the FDDI station that will 

submit synchronous traffic and ask for bandwidth allocation 
to a Synchronous Bandwidth Allocator. According to 

the Synchronous Bandwidth Allocator decision, the Third 
Party Requestor will then answer to the Quality of Service 

Allocator which will grant or deny the allocation over the 
whole path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the data communication
field and more particularly to a system for network wide
bandwidth allocation in a network made of at least one
FDDI segment.It is a current issue in the data communication field to
allow Multimedia applications to run over interconnected
networks.More particularly, it is a current issue to fulfill the
need by Multimedia applications of bandwidth and end-to-end
guaranteed delay, i.e. what is called Quality of Service
(QoS) Requirements.The availability of Fiber Distributed Data Interface
(FDDI) network is of great interest in this context. The
telecommunication users are particularly sensitive to its
response time and the guaranteed bandwidth involved in the
communication through the network especially when the
communications are exchanged between Multimedia applications
- i.e. the possibility for a Client/Server application
to transmit and receive multimedia data through a
telecommunication network at any instant and without delay -.Such QoS requirements imply that the telecommunication
network be able to manage its available bandwidth and
response time which are likely to change throughout time
and impact the communication quality. The issue is the
network-wide allocation, in a network including FDDI and
interconnected Local Area Networks (LANs), such as the one
shown Figure 9.The allocation of bandwidth is the mean to reserve a
certain level of QoS on a LAN or on interconnected LANs 
and for that two components are put in place: an Allocator
and a Requestor.
The Allocator is the component responsible for
maintaining awareness of the capacity of the LAN components
- i.e. bridges and segments - , determining whether a
particular request for a request for a bandwidth allocation
can be granted.The Requestor is the component responsible for making a
request to reserve a certain QoS for an application.Further details regarding bandwidth allocation with respect
to LANs can be found further.For FDDI segments, these QoS requirements are fulfilled by
usage of synchronous traffic. The synchronous allocation
process is already defined and standardized as explained
further.The problem raised, based on the fact that there should be
only one authority giving allocations, is how to make
these two processes coexist.Publication in the Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOM '92

<CLAIMS>
System for network wide bandwidth allocation in a network made of at
least one FDDI Segment and at least one non-FDDI Segment , comprising:


a server coupled to the FDDI Segment and comprising a Quality of
Service Requestor for requesting quality of service,
a network bandwidth allocator (NRR) comprising a Quality of Service
Allocator coupled to the non-FDDI Segment, for getting requests and

setting answers from and to said Quality of Service Requestor,
a synchronous bandwidth allocator (SBA) on said FDDI segment for
allocating bandwidth on said FDDI Segment,

said system being characterized in that the system comprises:

a third party requestor (3PR), with Inputs/Outputs for interfacing
between said network bandwidth allocator (NRR) and said synchronous

bandwidth allocator (SBA), and Inputs/Outputs for interfacing between
said server and said synchronous bandwidth allocator (SBA), and
means (C) in said network bandwidth allocator (NRR) having
Input/Output for interfacing between said Quality of Service

Allocator and said third party requestor (3PR).
