<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a locking device according to the 
preamble of claim 1. Thus, the invention is directed to locking devices for interconnecting 
parts or members of arbitrary types broadly spoken with in very 
different fields of use.  
 A locking device of this type is known through GB-A-700 501 and in this it is 
possible, thanks to the movability of the projection, in the way that this is displaceable 
completely out of and into locking engagement with the recess of the 
second part without any requirement of a relative movement of said parts, to 
bring different parts to be interlocked or separated comparatively comfortable 
towards each other to the position suited for interlocking and away from each 
other, respectively. However, it is highly desirable that said element carrying the projection and the 
grippable operating member are arranged in such a way that they will constitute 
no obstacle when any object is to be placed close to that part on which this 
element is arranged. Otherwise an attempt to obtain packaging or for instance 
storing of the assembly formed by the two parts will risk to deform or damage 
the operating member or the latter will scratch or damage said object. In order to avoid this problem the locking device according to GB-A-700 501 
has not been provided with any grippable operating member in the real sense 
of this definition, but it is the very head of the bolt-like projection that has to be 
gripped for operating the locking element provided with this projection. Thus, 
the accessibility to said element for operation thereof is very restricted. The object of the present invention is to provide a locking device of the type 
defined in the preamble of claim 1, which solves the problem adhered to the 
locking device of GB-A-700 501 and discussed above in connection therewith. This is obtained by providing a locking device according to the appended claim 
1. Thanks to the construction of the operating member as a freely flexible flap-like 
element, the operating member may easily be gripped in the interconnecting 
state thereof, but it will nevertheless easily be folded away and may be 
pressed flat against that part on which the element carrying the projection is arranged 
when this is required, and it will accordingly not in any way be in the 
way for any object to be placed directly next to said part. This means that there 
is no risk for any damage on such an object by the grippable operating member  
 
when said part is packed closely with respect to

<CLAIMS>
A locking device for interlocking parts (1, 2, 3) separable from 
each other, said device comprising at least a first locking means 

(11) arranged on a first (1, 3) one of said parts and having a projection 
(14) and at least a second locking means (17) arranged in the 

second part (2), cooperating with the first one and having a corresponding 
recess, said projection (14) being arranged movable with 

respect to the first part (1, 3) and displaceable out of and into locking 
engagement with the recess (17) of the second part without any 

movement of the parts with respect to each other, said first locking 
means comprising an element (12) carrying the projection (14) and 

said element (12) and thereby the projection (14) being arranged to 
be operated through gripping and pulling a grippable operating 

member (20) connected to the element carrying the projection, 

characterized
 in that the operating member is formed by a flap-like 
element (20), and that the flap-like element is freely flexible.  

 
A locking device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
flap-like element (20) is heeled onto the projection (14) through a 

recess therein. 
A locking device according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the 
flap-like element (20) is adapted to be pulled substantially in the 

direction of the heeling thereof onto the projection (14) on actuating 
the first locking means (11).  

 
A locking device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
two parts (1, 2, 3) form parts of an enclosure. 
A locking device according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the 
enclosure is a container, and that the first locking means (11) is 

arranged on a lid (3) and/or a bottom member (1) and the second 
locking means is arranged on a wall a
rrangement (2) of the container 
for interlocking on one hand the lid and/or the bottom member 

and on the other the wall arrangement. 
A locking device according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in that the 
wall arrangement (2) and the container are foldable, that the first 

locking means (11) is adapted to interlock on one hand the lid (3) 
and/or the bottom member (1) and on the other the wall arrangement 

(2) in the unfolded state of the container and to grip into corresponding 
second recesses (22) of the one of the lid and the bottom 

member (1) it is not itself arranged on in the folded state of the 
container so as to interlock the lid (3) and the bottom member (1) so 

that they in the interlocked state create a space therebetween, in 
which the folded wall arrangement (2) is receivable. 
A locking device according to any of the claims 4-6, 
characterized
 
in that the two enclosure parts (1, 2, 3) are arranged to
