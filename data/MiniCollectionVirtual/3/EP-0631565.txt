<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a catalytically active carbonaceous char for the removal 
of chloramines from gas or liquid streams. Chloramines in low concentrations arise from the disinfection of drinking water sources. To improve 
the taste and odor of the water and to remove the inherently toxic chloramines, the water is typically 
contacted with activated carbon. The ability of carbonaceous materials, such as activated carbon, to remove 
chloramines from aqueous streams is generally well known. It is also known that improvements in 
monochloramine removal can be achieved by reducing the mean particle diameter of the carbon and 
increasing the empty bed contact time. In some applications, such as in kidney dialysis units, high rates of 
monochloramine removal are particularly important. Although parameters such as contact time and mean 
particle diameter are known to affect chloramine removal efficiencies, removal performance is not well 
understood nor particularly effective. EP-A-0 022 368 discloses a method of removing contaminating impurities, particularly 
haloamines, from leisure pool water, wherein the pool water containing 
contaminants is passed into an active carbon bed of high surface area that has 
been treated with a reagent such as hypothalous acid. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide a method of enhanced chloramine 
removal. It is a further object of the invention to provide a carbonaceous char which is intrinsically 
catalytically active for chloramine removal apart from factors such as contact time, mean particle diameter, 
and the like which are known to affect chloramine removal. Generally, the present invention comprises a method for removing chloramines from aqueous media 
by contacting said media with a catalytically-active carbonaceous char which is characterized by its ability  
 
to rapidly decompose hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solutions. Prior art carbon materials which have been 
used for this application in the past do not rapidly decompose hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solutions. The 
carbonaceous chars used in the present invention may be prepared from carbon materials which have been 
contacted or otherwise exposed to nitrogen-containing compounds at temperatures above 700Â°C and are 
characterized by an ability to rapidly decompose hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solutions. The carbonaceous feedstocks from which such carbons are produced may be either nitrogen-poor 
naturally-occurring materials such as coals or nitrogen-rich
