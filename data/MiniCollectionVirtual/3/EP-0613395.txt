<ABSTRACT>
Electrochemical cell consisting of an O2- anion conductor solid electrolyte in contact with an anode and cathode of identical or different composition. Said solid electrolyte consists of a composition derived from Bi4V2O11, one at least of the constitutive cationic elements being substituted by at least one substituent element chosen so that the structural type of the Bi4V2O11 gamma phase is maintained together with the balance of the charges. Either the anode or the cathode is made of a material comprising at least one substitution element of the composition derived from Bi4V2O11, said element being in the metal or cationic state. The invention also concerns the use of the electrochemical cell for oxygen separation or extraction.
