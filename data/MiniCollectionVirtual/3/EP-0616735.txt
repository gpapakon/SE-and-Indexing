<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector is provided, whose housing is securely connected to the shields of shielded cables while conductors of the cables are connected to contacts of the connector, in a low cost arrangement. A ring (52, Fig. 3) is installed under the braided shield of the cable to provide a bulged shield portion (54) which is pressed against a conductive cable-supporting surface (76, Fig. 4) of the housing. The ring is preferably of elastomeric material, and a simple tie (100, Fig. 6) can surround the cables and a housing retainer (66) to securely hold them together, the tie lying in slots (81 - 83) of the retainer.

<DESCRIPTION>
Connectors that are attached to shielded cables 
generally require a means for securely connecting the cable 
shield to the conductive housing of the connector. Such 
connection to the shield must occur while one or more 
central conductors of the cable are connected to contacts of 
the connector. An emerging use for such connectors is for 
power cables that can supply current to electric vehicles to 
recharge their batteries. One current approach uses three 
separate shielded cables extending to a connector, with the 
shield of each cable connected to the housing of the 
connector and with a single central conductor of each cable 
connected to a contact of the connector. The connector must 
be designed for mass production at low cost, while reliably 
connecting to each cable in a manner that facilitate field 
repairs. EP-A-0 290 353 discloses a connector having a ring lying 
about the insulation of a shielded insulated cable, such that a 
portion of the shield forms a bulge around the ring. Inserted 
in the connector housing the whole of the periphery of the 
shield bulge is contacted. In accordance with the present invention, an electrical 
connector according to claims 1 and 7 is provided, for 
attachment to a shielded cable, which assures reliable 
electrical connection between the cable shield and the 
connector housing in a simple, low cost, and easily 
reparable construction.  
 The novel features of the invention are set forth 
with particularity in the appended claims. The invention 
will be best understood from the following description when 
read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is an isometric view of a connector system 
constructed in accordance with the present invention, 
showing receptacle and plug connectors prior to mating. Fig. 2 is a partial sectional view of the 
connector system of Fig. 1, with the connectors fully mated. Fig. 3 is a partial sectional view of a prepared 
cable of the connector system of Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 4 is a partial rear isometric view of the
