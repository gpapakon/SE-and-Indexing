<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inhibitors of trypsin
useful for treatment of pancreatitis.In a healthy mammal, the pancreas produces and
secretes enzymes that digest carbohydrates, fats and
proteins in the gastrointestinal tract. They are produced
in inactive form (termed proenzyme) and subsequently are
converted to an active form in the small intestine giving
rise to a cascade of amylolytic, lipolytic and proteolytic
activity. The cascade is thought to begin with the
conversion of pancreatic trypsinogen to trypsin catalyzed
by enterokinase, a proteolytic enzyme associated with the
small intestine. The newly-formed trypsin then converts
the other pancreatic proenzymes into their active forms to
trigger a burst of enzymatic activity characterized as
digestion. Greenberger et al., Diseases of the Pancreas,
"Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine," 11th
Edition, p. 1372, McGraw-Hill, (E. Brunewald et al. edit,
1987).In the absence of perturbing factors, the pancreas
is able to protect itself from the autodigestion which
could result from the digestive enzymes it produces. The
pancreatic acinar cells (where the digestive enzymes are
synthesized and stored) provide three control mechanisms
to prevent their own destruction. First, the enzymes are 
produced as catalytically inactive proenzymes. Second,
after their synthesis, but before secretion into the
digestive system, the enzymes are segregated from the
acinar cell cytoplasm in lysosomes (membrane-bound
intracellular organalles). Third, the lysosomes
containing the enzymes contain potent protein inhibitors
of trypsin which prevent premature activation of other
hydrolytic proenzymes. Steer el al., New England Journal
of Medicine, 316: 144 (1987).In the presence of perturbing factors, a disorder of
the pancreas termed pancreatitis (either acute or chronic)
may result. Acute pancreatitis can manifest itself as a
mild and self-limiting disorder (termed edematous
pancreatitis), or in a more severe form (termed
necrotizing pancreatitis) where permanent damage to
pancreatic tissue occurs. Chronic pancreatitis results in
extensive and permanent destruction of the pancreas.
Greenberger et al., supra, at 1372.Acute pancreatitis is usually associated with
biliary tract stones, while chronic pancreatitis is often
associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Steer et al.,
supra, at 144. Pancreatitis may also arise as a
complication of cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary
bypass procedures, and is reported to follow all types of
open-heart surgery, including cardiac
