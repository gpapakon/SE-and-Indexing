<ABSTRACT>
A bulb supporting device of a vehicle lamp 
assembly consists of a socket (12), a resilient gasket (22) 

having a first surface abutting an annular surface (20) within 
the socket, and a bulb holder (14) having an annular flange (18) with 

a surface abutting a second surface of the gasket (22). 
The gasket (22) has two annular ribs (24,26) on one of its 

surfaces with openings (30,32) at circumferentially spaced 
locations to provide a labyrinth-type flow path for air to 

enter and exit the interior of the lamp assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bulb supporting device 
comprising a socket in a vehicle lamp assembly, a resilient 
gasket having a first surface abutting an annular surface 
within the socket, and a bulb holder having an annular 
flange with a surface abutting a second surface of the 
gasket. A retainer arrangement of this type is disclosed 
in US-A-2219770. It is also known from US-A-5095410 to provide a 
retainer arrangement for maintaining a bulb assembly within 
a socket in a vehicle lamp and arranged to established a 
labyrinth-type flow path for air to enter and exit the 
interior of the lamp assembly, the bulb assembly having an 
annular flange with a surface arranged to confront a 
complimentary surface on the lamp assembly to bound said 
labyrinth-type flow path. According to the invention, in a bulb supporting 
device of the type described above, the gasket has 
formations bounding a labyrinth-type flow path for air to 
enter and exit the interior of the lamp assembly. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a retainer 
arrangement in accordance with the invention, having a 
gasket between the lamp assembly and the bulb assembly; and Figure 2 is a side view of the gasket of the 
retainer arrangement shown in Figure 1. A vehicle lamp assembly has a body 10 with a 
cylindrical socket 12 for receiving a bulb holder 14. The 
bulb holder 14 supports a bulb 16 and has an annular flange 
18 which confronts a complimentary inwardly-directed flange 
20 formed within the socket 12. A synthetic rubber gasket 
22 is located between the flanges 18 and 20. As can best be seen from Figure 2, the gasket 22 
has three concentric annular ribs 24, 26 and 28 on the 
surface confronting the flange 20. The outer rib 24 is cut 
away at the bottom of the gasket 22 to form an air inlet  
 
30. Similarly, the central and inner ribs 26 and 28 are 
cut away at the top of the gasket 22 to form an air outlet 
32. In use, air can flow into the bottom of the socket 12, 
as indicated by arrow A in Figure 1, then up through the 
inlet 30, round the groove between the outer rib 24 and 
central 26 and then through the outlet 32 into the interior 
of the body 10 as indicated by the arrow B. The groove 
between the central rib 26 and inner rib 28 has no 
communication with the inlet 30 and therefore does not form 
part of the labyrinth flow path. As can be seen in Figure 1, the gasket 22 has 
three annular ribs
