<ABSTRACT>
A die for press-molding glass optical elements which can 
press-mold glass optical elements having high melting points and 

various shapes repeatedly, which includes a base material (13) 
having high strength on which a cutting layer (12) having heat 

resistance and free cutting machinability is formed. After 
cutting the cutting layer (12) into the desired shape with high 

accuracy, the die is coated with a surface protective film (11). 
The cutting layer (12) is formed by an amorphous film or an alloy 
film containing one of P,B,Cu or Si. The surface protective layer (11) 

is formed by an alloy film comprising at least one of Pt,Pd,Ir,Rh, 
Os,Ru,Re,W,Ta. The cutting layer (12) can be formed by plating, 

evaporation, sputtering or ion plating the said film on the base 
material (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a die used for press-molding glass
optical elements
having high surface accuracy. This invention also relates to the
use of the die for the press-molding process, and to a method of
manufacturing the die.In order to press-mold glass optical elements having high
accuracy repeatedly by means of a die, it is necessary to use a
die material which is stable at high temperatures, has excellent
resistance to oxidation, and is inert with respect to glass. In
addition, the material must have excellent mechanical strength so
that the surface accuracy is maintained when pressed. On the
other hand, the material must have excellent machinability so as
to be machined precisely and easily.It is disclosed that die materials which meet these
requirements to some degree are a mixed material consisting of
titanium carbide (TiC) and metal (Japanese patent
application No. JP-A-59121126) or a material comprising a
base material of cemented carbide on which a precious metal film
is formed (Japanese patent application No. 
JP-A-62096331).However, the conventional materials of the die do not
meet the above-mentioned requirements completely. For example,
the material of the die using a mixed material of TiC and metal
has excellent mechanical strength, but is poor in machinability
due to its extreme hardness. Thus, it is difficult to machine
with high accuracy. In addition, this material has a further
defect in that it easily reacts to lead (Pb) or an alkaline
element contained in glass optical elements .When a material comprises a base material of cemented
carbide on which a precious metal film is formed, a diamond wheel
is used to machine the cemented carbide. At this time, it is
difficult to form a fine shape due to wear of the diamond wheel.
Therefore, a special processing device is needed. Furthermore,
there are problems that the process take a long time and that the
die is extremely expensive.A further problem is that a diamond tool used for cutting
the hard base material is worn down during the process.
Therefore, it is impossible to proceed with the cutting, and a
shape having a small radius of curvature which can not be
attained by a grinding process can not be fabricated.The following method of manufacturing a die has proposed
a solution to the above-noted problems (Japanese patent
application No. JP-A-62003031). A base material used here 
has excellent heat resistance, heat shock resistance, and
strength at high temperatures. A fine cutting layer comprising a
material which can be ground and
