<ABSTRACT>
The system includes a plurality of disk arrays for storing, sequentially, 
contiguous segments of a data block. In the case of movies, each segment includes, for 

example, a few seconds of each relevant movie. An electronic commutator sequentially 
connects the disk arrays to a corresponding plurality of access channels. While the 

individual connections between each of the disk arrays and each of the access channels 
have a certain bit capacity, the overall bit capacity of the system is that certain bit 

capacity times the number of corresponding disk arrays and access channels. The 
electronic commutator switches sequentially between the respective connections at a 

predetermined rate which is commensurate with the size of the segments stored on the 
disk arrays and which is dependent on the desired amount of wait time for one access 

channel to be connected to each of the disk arrays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to a system for storing large amounts of data and
for providing simultaneous plural access to said stored data, said system comprising: a mass
storage medium having a number N of individual storage arrays for storing said data, each of
said storage arrays having input/output means and an access medium having access channels,
each of said access channels having input/output means.One of the advantages of present day cable television is the provision of pay-per-view
features. However, a drawback is that the viewer is locked into viewing the program
at the time that the feature is provided by the cable supplier.A new service being proposed is video-on-demand where, for example, a
movie selected by the user is provided to that user when desired by the user. One problem in
implementing this type system is being able to store a large number of individual movies
effectively. Another problem is being able to access and deliver these stored individual
movies to different users.The first problem may be addressed by the various data compression schemes
in which the video information is digitized and then compressed (JPEG, MPEG, etc.). This
compressed data may then be stored in a mass storage medium.The second problem is more problematical. There are various proposals for
constructing a bus system ("big bus") for connecting the mass storage medium to a
distribution system, e.g. a cable system. However, the design of this "big bus is very
complicated and is not subject to expansion. In particular, to achieve a high data bandwidth,
the "big bus" would have to incorporate costly ultra-high speed components, since a bus has
only one data path. In addition, in a high-bandwidth parallel digital bus type system having
many data lines, devices attached to the bus must be physically close to the bus, and the bus
can have only a limited physical length. Furthermore, such a bus would be very expensive.The International Patent Application published under number WO 91/14229
describes a system for communication in a data processing system. The system has a plurality
of device sets for storing the data, each device set having at least two access ports. The
system provides access to the device sets through a plurality of channels, whereby for a 
specific device set at least two channels are provided to the at least two access ports of that
device respectively.It is an object of the present invention to provide a system of the above type
which is easily expandable and more economical.The above object

A system for storing large amounts of data and for providing simultaneous
plural access to said stored data, said system comprising:


a mass storage medium having, a number N of individual storage arrays for
storing said data, each of said storage arrays (20.1 - 20.6) having input/output means; and
an access medium having access channels (22.1 - 22.6), each of said access
channels having input/output means;
characterized in that
 the access medium has a corresponding number N of access channels
and that the system further comprises:


a commutator (24) having a corresponding number N of commutation paths,
each of said paths connecting the input/output means of one of said number of individual

storage arrays with the input/output means of one of said access channels; and
control means (26) for causing said commutator to cyclically switch said
commutation paths such that


T = N x t

where t is the time spent at each position of the commutator and T is the amount of time for
one of the access channels to have been connected to each and every one of the N number of

storage arrays.
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of said storage arrays (20.1 -
20.6) comprises a plurality of storage sections (28) each having an input/output line, said

input/output means of said storage arrays comprising said input/output lines in combination,
thereby enabling plural access to said storage sections in parallel.
A system as claimed in claim 2, wherein each of said access channels (36.1 -
36.3) comprises a plurality of access sub-channels (48) each having an input/output line, said

input/output means of said access channels comprising said input/output lines in
combination, thereby enabling parallel processing by said access sub-channels of data

accessed from said storage sections in parallel. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said data is recorded onto said
storage medium in segments distributed sequentially among said storage arrays (20.1 - 20.6),

each of said segments being wholly accessible within said time t, whereby each of said access
channels may access the same data within a time period of (N-1) x t.
A system as claimed in claim 2, wherein said storage sections are magnetic
disks (28).
A system as claimed in claim 2 or 5, wherein said data is written into at least
two of said sections redundantly.
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said data is compressed video data
representing a plurality of movies.
A system as claimed in claim 7, wherein said access medium is part of a cable
television system.
A system as claimed in claim 3, wherein said input/output lines of said storage
sections and said access sub-channels have a first bit rate, and said control means causes said

data to be transferred from said storage sections to said access sub-channels at said first bit
rate during each time t, each of said access sub-channels including a access line having a

second bit rate, slower than said first bit rate, for providing the data, and a buffer memory for
temporarily storing the data accessed from the storage sections to compensate for the

dissimilarity between the first and the second bit rates.

matrix switch having a plurality of inputs and outputs, connecting means for selectively

connecting said inputs to said outputs, and addressing means for controlling said connecting
means, said addressing means having an address input, and wherein said control means (26)

includes means for generating addresses for application to the address input of said
