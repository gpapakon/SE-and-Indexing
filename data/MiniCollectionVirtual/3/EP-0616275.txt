<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive control man-augmentation system controls the 
movement of a suspended work station. A support structure, 

usually mounted on a chassis, has an extendible boom and a work 
station at the end of the boom. A directing member pivots in 

accordance with operator movements and the pivotal movement is 
resolved along three axes, normal to each other and at any 

point in time having a fixed but readily alterable relationship 
the boom. Resolving of the movement provides signals for moving 

the boom so as to move the work station to any desired location 
and orienting the work station, in response to operator 

movements. The position of the work station and other selected 
functional system are monitored. The signals are continuously 

processed and outputs adapted with respect to situation 
variables to produce immediate and accurate operational 

responses of the workstation to match operator requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates broadly to an adaptive control man-augmentation system for
moving and orienting suspended workstations. In particular, the invention relates to the
task coordinated controlled movement of load manipulators.A typical example of such apparatus is the work platform which supports a fruit picker,
where the invention provides for controlled movement and positioning of such platform
continuously or intermittently as directed by the picker while he is simultaneously
performing fruit location, detachment and disposal tasks. In some instances, the
operator may not be positioned on the work station but on the ground or some other
point on the machine structure. An example of such use is in pruning in which a
remotely controlled articulated cutter can be mounted at the workstation, the operation
of positioning the cutter and operating the cutter being carried out by an operator at
some other position, for example, on the ground.In its broadest aspects the present invention is useful in any equipment situation in
which it is desired to position a worker and/or other task effectors in various spatial
locations to enable them to carry out task operations. Such operations include the
fabrication or inspection and repair of mechanical 
structures, the application, restoration or removal of
decorative embellishments, or the transportation placement and
retrieval of equipment or materials, and other situations
wherein three dimensional positioning of the worker and spatial
orientation of the task effectors is necessary. For purposes
of the present specification, preferred embodiments of the
invention will be described as utilized in a tree crop
servicing apparatus, a load manipulator apparatus and a bulk
handler apparatus.Several structures, both mobile and stationary, have been
proposed heretofore to elevate and position a worker adjacent
to various tree branches in order to facilitate multi-positional
tasks such as pruning, pollinating and harvesting
tree crops. As an example, fruit pickers are supported on a
platform, which may be in the form of a bucket, and the
platform be suspended by means of a powered, articulated
structure that can be moved to bring the picker into a picking
position. It has also been previously proposed that an
electro-hydraulic control system be provided for actuating the
various members of the support structure in response to the
task related positioning of a picker's body and thereby to move
the platform in a desired direction and at a desired rate. One
such system is
