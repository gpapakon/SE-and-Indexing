<ABSTRACT>
An additional heat-treatment step after transverse stretching, heat-setting and cooling gives a bowing value, expressed by the curvature, of less than 10 mm. The polyolefin film contains a propylene polymer comprising at least 90 % of propylene or a polypropylene mixture.

Method of producing a biaxially oriented polyolefin film which is extruded from a
slot die in the form of a pre-film, passed over at least one roll and cooled, successively
