<ABSTRACT>
An injection moulding machine has a plasticising and injecting screw which is moved axially by a crank drive rotating less than 180 deg. within the dead centres. The crank drive consists of two mirror cranks working in the same plane. One of the cranks is driven by a servo motor and the two cranks are connected by synchronising elements.

<CLAIMS>
An injection unit for injection moulding machines, having 
a plasticizing cylinder (13) with a plasticizing and injection 

screw (16) which is arranged rotatably therein and such that it 
is axially displaceable by a crank drive (25, 25'), the crank 

drive (25, 25') being movable to and fro between its two dead 
centre points in a range of 
>
 0° and 
<
 180°, characterized in 
that the crank drive comprises two crank gears (25, 25') which 

operate in a common horizontal plane and are arranged with mirror 
symmetry with respect to one another, one of the crank gears (25) 

being connected to a servomotor (31) by way of a gear mechanism, 

and synchronization elements (41, 41') being provided for the 
symmetrical movement of the two crank gears (25, 25'). 
An injection unit according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that there are provided as the synchronization elements two 

mutually meshing toothed wheels (41, 41'), of which in each case 
one is arranged non-rotatably on the drive shaft (30) of the 

respective crank (27, 27'). 
An injection unit according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the driven shaft of the gear mechanism is at the same 

time the drive shaft (30) of the crank (27). 
An injection unit according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a pinion which meshes with the toothed 

wheel (41) arranged on the crank (27) is arranged on the driven 
shaft of the gear mechanism. 
An injection unit according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the crank drive (25, 25') is displaceable 

and lockable on the drive side on a restricted guidance means 
(34) relative to the plasticizing cylinder (13).
