<DESCRIPTION>
Xerostomia (dry mouth syndrome) is the result
of compromised salivary flow and is associated with a
wide variety of conditions and causative agents. The
condition can be the result of a pathological state such
as Sicca Syndrome (Sjogren's disease), dry gland disease,
polyglandular failure disfunction, and the like.
According to a 1986 National Institute of Dental Research
publication, over 300 commonly used drugs listed dry
mouth as a side effect of their use, the most prevalent
of which were the hypertensives and anti-depressants,
while others included pain killers, tranquilizers,
diuretics and even over-the-counter antihistamines. In
addition, treatments such as radiation treatment for
tumors in the head and neck region can cause the
sensation of dry mouth. Furthermore, age and stress have
been linked to xerostomia.The compromised salivary flow is frequently
responsible for a variety of symptoms such as a burning
sensation in the mouth, difficulty with speech, eating
and tasting, and the like. It can lead to mucosal
infections, bacterial sialadentis, periodontal disease
and dental caries.Dry mouth sufferers have used a variety of
self-help treatments, but these have not been
particularly satisfactory. Liquid remedies such as water
and artificial saliva offer short lived help, and the
artificial saliva exhibits a consistency similar to 
natural saliva which some sufferers view as distasteful.
Solid aids such as citric rinds and hard candies are
damaging to tooth enamel and extend no lubricating
comfort.A Jaboradini derivative, pilocarpine, has been
used as a sialogogue drug with success. However, the
drug is a muscarinic agonist which is known to produce
such non-specific systemic side effects as excessive
tearing and runny noses. The drug also presents the
danger of cardiac arrest if misused.Numerous are the approaches which have been
taken to soothe dry mouth discomfort appear in the
literature. Some, like those described in U.S. Patent
4,088,788 use masticatory stimulation to induce
salivation and some like in U.S. Patent 4,400,372 use an
acid containing chewing gum to achieve both masticatory
and gustatory stimulation. U.S. Patent 5,156,845 teaches
a lozenge with an acidulate, employing gustatory
stimulation to relieve oral dryness and also includes a
fluoride source to promote remineralization of the teeth.
U.S. Patent 4,265,877 describes a chewing gum which
includes a fluoride source for the same purpose.The use of polyethylene oxide as an artificial mucus, supplied in the form of a
