<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD OF HYDRODEHALOGENATING HALOGENATED ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCESField Of The InventionThe present invention is generally directed to the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated organic compounds in an aqueous medium in which the compounds are reacted with hydrogen or a source of hydrogen in the presence of palladium on a carbon substrate preferably under mild temperature and pressure conditions. The present invention is particularly suited for the removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons from aqueous contaminated environmental sources such as waste water and hazardous waste sites.Background Of The InventionThe removal of halogenated organic compounds from aqueous environmental sources including halogenated aromatic compounds such as chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols and halogenated aliphatic compounds such as methylene chloride, trichloroethanes and trichloroethylene has posed serious problems. Typically, the halogenated compounds have been disposed of by separating, such as by steam stripping, using a microporous hollow-fiber membrane, or carbon adsorption, the contaminants from their aqueous environment and then subjecting the resulting concentrated levels of contaminants to incineration. However, the combustion of halogenated organic compounds often results in the production of highly toxic by¬ products such as dioxins. Thus, incineration can itself become an environmentally unsafe practice and its use for the disposal 

of halogenated organic compounds problematical.Industry has therefore looked to alternative techniques for the destruction of halogenated hydrocarbons found in the environment. Among the techniques which have been studied are biological treatment and chemical dehalogenation.Chemical dehalogenation methods have been developed as an alternative to incineration and land disposal because they convert the halogenated organic compounds to less toxic non- halogenated compounds. One such process employs a sodiu - naphthalene reagent to form sodium chloride and an inert sludge. While the sludge can be safely incinerated, the process is complicated by requiring an air-free reaction vessel which limits its application for on-site treatment of contaminated environmental sources. In another approach, a dechlorination reagent is formed by reacting an alkali metal with polyethylene glycol in the presence of heat and oxygen.The above-mentioned processes, which involve the oxidative dechlorination of halogenated organic compounds, are generally highly sensitive to water.
