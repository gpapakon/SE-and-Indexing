<ABSTRACT>
In a window with a frame of extruded profile members a thermo pane is supported on the inside by a glazing bead connected with the frame profile member. The main frame mainly consists of wood profiles with weather-resisting coverings. A hinge pivot at the top of the window is formed by an edge portion (28) of an extruded profile member (27) connected to the main frame (20) and a hinge blade is formed by a hook-shaped wall portion (6) of the opposite frame profile member (1). To ensure engagement of said hinge pivot and hinge blade in the closed position of the window engaging means at one of the other sides of the window may comprise a sliding block (31) arranged displaceably in a track in a frame member between a fixed window position opposite a retaining device anchored in the main frame and an openable window position for connection to a motion transfer member guided in a recess in the main frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a window, comprising a
frame of extruded profile members which at their exterior
side surfaces parallel to the glass plane have
a first flange portion as a supporting member for an
edge portion of a thermo pane on the external side
thereof, whereas an opposite edge portion at the inside
of the thermo pane is supported by a glazing bead
connected with the profile member, and a main frame
mainly consisting of wood profiles, the exterior surfaces
of which are covered by weather-resisting coverings.The invention mainly but not exclusively has as
object windows designed as top-hinged roof windows to
be installed in inclined roofs.Windows of said type must, when openable, normally
be provided with separate, robust hinge elements
and motion transfer connections between the frame and
the main frame; this partly causes an increase of the
production costs and, partly often mars the appearance
of the window.Also, if it is desired to provide the window
with accessories known per se such as a roller blind,
a Venetian blind, an insect screen or the like, separate
fastening and movement control members for such
accessories are required.In openable windows of this type it is known
per se to use motor control for the opening/closing
movement and also for said accessories, but this has
usually required specially designed frame and main
frame structures often with relatively complicated
electrical wiring.The primary object of the invention is to provide
a window with a comparatively, simple frame and 
main frame structure in which the movement control
members and possible driving members for the opening/
closing movement of an openable window and/or accessories
of the above-mentioned type in so far as is
possible are integrated in the frame and main frame
profiles.A further object of the invention is to show a
window structure which without significant changes of
the frame and main frame profiles and in a relatively
economical way can be extended from a simple design as
a fixed window into an openable window either manually
operated or through a further extension into an advanced
structure with motor control of the opening/
closing movement and possible accessories.In addition, a particular object of the invention
is to provide a motion transfer member for use in
manually operated or motor-controlled openable windows
of a very simple structure and design which as little
as possible disfigures the frame and main frame
structures whether these are seen from the inside or
outside.According to a first
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A window comprising a frame of extruded profile
members (1-4) which at their exterior side surfaces

parallel to the glass plane have a first flange portion
as a supporting member for an edge portion of a thermo

pane (9) on an external side thereof, whereas an
opposite edge portion at an inside of the thermo pane

is supported by a glazing bead (13) connected with the
profile member, and a main frame mainly consisting of

wood profiles (20a-23a), the exterior surfaces of which
are covered by weather-resisting coverings, a hinge

member at the top of the window comprising a hinge pivot
formed by an edge portion (28) of an extruded profile

member (26) firmly connected to a main frame portion
(20) at this side and a hinge blade formed by a hook-shaped

wall portion (6) of an opposite frame profile
member (1), means being provided to ensure engagement

of said hinge pivot and said hinge blade in the closed
position of the window, 
characterized
 in that the hinge
blade forming wall portion (6) of the frame profile

member comprises a flange part (29) of the upper
exterior side wall of the frame profile member which

projects downwards substantially parallel to the glass
plane, whereas the hinge pivot forming edge portion is

formed by an upwards projecting oblique flange part (27)
of said extruded profile member (26) which is connected

with the upper side of the main frame member (20), said
engagement ensuring means being provided solely at one

of the sides of the window.
A window as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that said engagement ensuring means is provided at
at least at one vertical sides of the window and comprises

a member fastened to the frame profile and which
in the closed position of the window is retained in a

wood part of the frame profile. 
A window as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized

in that said member is a sliding block (32) arranged
displaceably in a track (31) in the frame profile

member, which block can be moved between a position
opposite a retaining device (36) anchored in the main

frame structure for permanently securing the frame in
case of a fixed window and a position in which it can

be connected to a motion transfer member (37) which is
guided in a recess in the wood profile of the main frame

for complete accommodation of the motion transfer member
(37) in the closed position of an openable window.
A window as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized

in that the motion transfer member is designed as a
curved rack (37) in engagement with a toothed wheel (40)

which is accommodated in said recess so as to be
retained against turning in the closed position of the

window.
A window as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized

in that the distance of said toothed wheel (40) from the
hinge member (28, 29) is smaller than the distance from

the hinge member (28, 29) to the connection point
between the sliding block and the motion transfer member

(37).

screen (43,52) and/or a Venetian blind (51).
A window as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized

(21) is provided with a recess (38) to accommodate at

least one drive motor for said accessories.
A window as claimed in claim 5 and 8, 
characterized

in that the main frame wood profiles are
provided with factory-mounted wiring (49, 50) underneath

the weather-resisting coverings for power supply to said
drive motor or motors.
A window as claimed in claim 9, 
characterized

in that in one of the frame portions said wiring is
connected to a factory-mounted switch member for a

plug-and-socket connection.
A window as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that the frame profile members
are provided with flange portions (14) forming tracks

(15) for sealing strips (16) for sealing engagement on
parts of the weather-resisting main frame coverings and

for insulation between these and the frame profile members.
A window as claimed in claim 11, 
characterized

in that one of said flange portions (14) is formed by
the glazing bead (13).
A window as claimed in claims 7 and 11,

least one of said flange portions of the frame profiles
are arranged for alternative connection to fixing

elements of an accordion-folded insect screen (52),

side and bottom portions of the frame and the main
frame.
A window as claimed in any of the preceding
claims and designed as a roof window to be mounted in 

an inclined roof, 
characterized
 in that the coverings
for weather-resistant connection between the main frame

and the surrounding roofing material are retained
between the main frame wood profile coverings or between

these and the main frame wood profiles. 
A window as claimed in claim 14, 
characterized

in that the frame profiles are provided with
flange portions (14) which form tracks (15) for sealing

strips (16) for sealing engagement with parts of the
weather-resisting main frame coverings for insulation
