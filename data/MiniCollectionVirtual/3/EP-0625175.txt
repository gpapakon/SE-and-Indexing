<DESCRIPTION>
 Material in the form of a sheet, a foil or a strip having a hydrophilic surface sealing/ method for producing it and its useThe invention relates to a material having a hydrophilic surface sealing, and to a method for producing it.Such a material can be used as support for a radiation- sensitive layer of an offset printing plate.In the radiation-sensitive layer a printing image is photomechanically copied, image-free locations on the support being formed by removing the corresponding areas of the radiation-sensitive layer. Simultaneously, the image- free locations form the background of the image. With regard to the printing process, it must be guaranteed that the image locations are hydrophobic and colour-absorbing and the image-free locations are hydrophilic and thus repel the oily or oleophilic printing colours. In addition, the support must ensure a good adhesion of the radio-sensitive layer in the image areas.Therefore, the prior art suggests an additional coating, the so-called sealing, between the support and the radio- sensitive layer for improving the adhesion of the latter and preventing staining of the support.Known methods are for instance the sealing with silicate, with condensed aryl sulfonic acid (DE-A-32 17 870) , with polyvinyl phosphonic acid (PVPA) (DE-A-16 21 478) or with an aqueous mixture of a hydrolysate or a condensate of a silane 

and a fluoride of an alkali metal or of the metals Ti, Zr or Si (DE-A-39 28 794) .EP-A-0 089 510 discloses a support material of aluminum or an alloy thereof which is covered with a hydrophilic sealing layer which is produced inter alia by using polyvinyl phosphonic acid with admixtures of silicates, borates and fluoroborates. These admixtures improve the adhesion of the image, the shelf-life of the radiation-sensitive layer, the hydrophilic action and the resistance to SnCl2.The problem underlying the invention is to provide a support material having a hydrophilic surface sealing and a method for producing it by means of which the support characteristics are further improved and a universally usable sealing is achieved which has advantages for positively, negatively as well as for instance electrophotographically working printing plates.This problem is solved with the features of the claims.The solution according to the invention is based on the idea to mix polyvinyl phosphonic acid with hydrofluoric acid as an agent which etches the support surface, and to use this as sealing solution.It has been found that the invention makes it possible to

Claims
1. A material in the form of a sheet, a foil or a strip having a hydrophilic surface sealing which can be produced by a sealing solution containing polyvinyl phosphonic acid (PVPA) in a concentration ranging from 0.01 to 10 g/1 and hydrofluoric acid (HF) in a concentration ranging from 0.005 to 5 g/1.
2. The material according to claim 1, characterized in that the material consists of aluminum or an alloy thereof or that it is chromium-plated.
3. The material according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the material was anodically oxidized prior to the surface sealing.
4. The material according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the sealing solution is an aqueous solution which contains other acids or anions in addition to PVPA and HF.
5. A method for the hydrophilic sealing of a material in the form of a sheet, a foil or a strip using a sealing solution according to claim 1, wherein the sealing solution is applied by spraying or by a dipping process at a temperature ranging from 5 to 90Â°C.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein an aqueous rinse is provided after the application of the sealing.
7. The method according to any one of claims 5 to 6, characterized in that the material consists of aluminum or an alloy thereof or is chromium-plated. 


8. The use of the material according to any one of claims 1 to 4 as substrate material in the production of an of set printing plate which carries a radiation-sensitive coating.
