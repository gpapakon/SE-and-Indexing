<ABSTRACT>
A composition of a xanthan broth prepared from a culture medium containing, in particular, at least one source of sulphur of concentration, counted as elemental sulphur, at most equal to 60 mg per litre of culture medium, and from at least one strain of the genus Xanthomonas, and from a source of proteins in a weight ratio of protein to xanthan between 0.05 and 2. The recovered broth preferably containing the cells, at alkaline pH and in the presence of divalent cations, with the proteins, constitutes a composition which exhibits thixotropic properties. Application of the composition in a drilling fluid for drilling wells.
