<ABSTRACT>
Unsealed packets (2a) of cigarettes emerging from a
packaging machine (5) present an outer surface (10)

consisting in an opaque wrapping material, to which
a revenue stamp (3) and a coupon (4) are affixed as

the packets (2a) are transferred directly and in an
ordered succession from the packaging machine (5)

to a cellophaner (6); on reaching the cellophaner,
each packet (2a) in turn is enveloped in a sheet of

transparent overwrapping material (15) covering the
opaque wrapping material, the revenue stamp (3) and

the coupon (4), and the overwrapping sealed in such
a way that the finished packet (2; 72) will remain

substantially airtight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
fashioning packets of cigarettes (see for example
GB-A-2 157 260).In particular, the present invention relates to a
method by which to fashion sealed packets of
cigarettes.A typical packet of cigarettes is composed of an
ordered group of cigarettes, a first sheet of soft
and generally metal foil backed wrapping material
enveloping the cigarettes, and a second sheet of
soft wrapping material enveloping the first sheet;
in this instance the packet produced is of the soft
or crush type. Alternatively, the second sheet of
wrapping material can be a stiff material such as
cardboard, procured in the form of a diecut blank
which is folded about the first wrapper to fashion
a packet of the rigid type incorporating a hinged
lid. The single packet of cigarettes, be it a crush
or rigid type, is overwrapped in a relative sheet
of transparent material, normally cellophaneÂ® or
polypropylene, of which the folds are sealed to 
obtain a substantially airtight closure.Packets of cigarettes are manufactured utilizing
equipment that includes packaging machines, with
stations by which the wrapping materials mentioned
above are applied to and folded around the relative
groups of cigarettes, and cellophaners comprising
a feed station supplying single cellophane sheets,
folding stations at which the sheets are wrapped
around the packets, and sealing stations by which
the folded cellophane sheets are secured.In addition to these operations, it is customary in
certain countries to affix a revenue stamp to each
single packet of cigarettes before the cellophane
overwrapping is applied. The stamp indicates that
the packet is subject to a state excise duty in the
country of sale, and remains visible through the
transparent overwrapping.Likewise in certain countries, it is the practice
to insert a printed coupon into each packet. The
coupon appears as a single leaf or fan-folded slip
of paper, which might bear an advertising message
or a collectable image, and is inserted normally
between the first sheet of wrapping material and
the second sheet or the cardboard blank, depending
on the type of packet. It has been found that the 
product suffers damage when the coupon is placed in
direct contact with the first sheet of wrapping
material, since the inks on the printed face of the
coupon give off vapours that affect the aroma of
the tobacco.Furthermore, the equipment employed typically to
fashion packets with both the revenue stamp and a
coupon is somewhat complex, as provision must be
made

<CLAIMS>
A method for fashioning sealed packets of cigarettes
furnished with respective revenue stamps (3) and

respective coupons (4), comprising the steps of
assembling packets (2a) of cigarettes in a

packaging machine (5), each packet presenting an outer
surface (10) afforded by an opaque wrapping

material; transferring the packets (2a) of
cigarettes directly from the packaging machine (5)

to a cellophaner (6); overwrapping the opaque
wrapping material of each packet (2a) with a

transparent material (15) and securing the
transparent material to fashion a sealed packet (2;

72) of cigarettes; applying a revenue stamp (3) to
the outer surface (10) of each packet (2a) during

the transfer step, 
characterised in that
 the method
comprises the step of applying a coupon (4) to the

outer surface (10) of each packet (2a) during the
transfer step, the coupon (4) covering at least in

part the revenue stamp (3). 
A method as in claim 1, wherein the outer surface
(10) comprises two parallel and opposite larger

faces (11), two parallel and opposite flank faces
(12) and two parallel and opposite end faces (13),

and the coupon (4) is applied to a first of the two
larger faces (11).
A method as in claim 2, wherein the revenue stamp
(3) is applied at least in part to the first larger

face (11) of the packet (2a) of cigarettes.
A method as in claim 2 or 3, wherein the revenue
stamp (3) is applied in part to the first larger

face (11) and in part to a first flank face (12)
adjoining the first larger face (11), by affixing a

first portion initially to the first larger face
(11) then bending and flattening the remaining

portion against the first flank face (12).
A method as in claim 2, wherein the revenue 
stamp (3) is applied in its entirety to a first

flank face (12) adjoining the first larger face
(11).
A method as in claims 1 to 5, wherein the step of
applying the revenue stamp (3) precedes the step of

applying the coupon (4).
Equipment (1; 70) for fashioning sealed packets of
cigarettes each with a respective revenue stamp (3)

and a respective coupon (4), comprising a packaging
machine (5) serving to assemble unsealed packets

(2a) of cigarettes presenting an opaque wrapping
material outermost; a cellophaner (6) by which a

transparent overwrapping material (15) is applied
over the opaque wrapping material of each packet

(2a) in turn to form a respective sealed packet (2;
72) of cigarettes; a device (7; 71) by which the

unsealed packets (2a) of cigarettes are transferred
directly from the packaging machine (5) to the

cellophaner (6); also a device (8) positioned

revenue stamp (3) is applied to each packet (2a) of 
cigarettes, 
characterised in that

device (7) comprises a first rectilinear conveyor

(17) extending from the packaging machine (5) to
the cellophaner (6) and presenting a first belt

and the device (9) for applying the coupons (4) are
stationed.
Equipment as in claim 8, wherein the first
conveyor (17) is disposed adjacent to a wrapping

wheel (35) forming part of the cellophaner (6), in
such a way that packets (2a) of cigarettes

advancing along the conveyor (17) can be 
transferred directly to the wheel (35).
Equipment as in claim 9, wherein the transfer
device (7) comprises a second conveyor (28) located

above the first conveyor (17) and adjacent to the
wrapping wheel (35).
Equipment as in claim 10, wherein the transfer
device (7) comprises a first rectilinear conveyor

(17) presenting a first belt (18) affording a
substantially horizontal active branch (27), and a

second conveyor (28) presenting a second belt (29)
