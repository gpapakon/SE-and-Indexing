<ABSTRACT>
A root crop harvester (10) comprising a forward crop-digger section (11), a conveying section (12, 15) arranged to receive material dug-up by the forward section (11) and to convey the material rearwardly to a discharge position (16) while carrying out at least partial separation of stone, clod and soil from the crop, and a roller separator device (25) arranged to receive material from the conveying section (12, 15) and to carry out further cleaning of the crop; in which the discharge end (16) of the conveying section (12, 15) is adjustable relative to the roller separator (25, 25a) between one position of adjustment (16a) in which there is maximum contact with the surfaces of the rollers (22) of the roller separator (25) suitable for heavy soil conditions, and a further adjusted position (16b) in which there is a reduced length of contact with the rollers of the roller separator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a root crop harvester which
comprises a forward crop-digger section, a conveying section
arranged to receive material dug-up by said forward section and
to convey the material rearwardly while carrying out at least
partial separation of stones, clods and soil from the crop so
as to deliver at least partly screened crop material to a
discharge end of the conveying section, and a roller separator
device arranged to receive said material from the conveying
section and to carry out further screening of the crop.It is known to provide a so-called roller separator,
(roller table or axial cleaning rollers), to provide a final
cleaning action on a root crop, such as potatoes, and which
comprises a set of parallel rollers closely spaced apart from
each other to define spaces therebetween through which
separated stone and soil can fall under gravity while the crop
remains supported by the roller surfaces. Usually, the rollers
are made of rubber, or are clad with rubber sleeves, to provide
gentle handling of the crop and thereby to minimise damage to
the crop, and at least some of the rollers usually have spiral
"flights" which assist in conveying the crop axially of the
rollers to a discharge end of the rollers, and also to separate
haulm from potatoes.The rollers may also be inclined downwardly at a small
angle to the horizontal from their rotary mountings at one end,
so that gravity action also assists the movement of the crop
along the lengths of the rollers. At the discharge end of the
rollers, there may be arranged a discharge conveyor e.g. an
elevator leading to a temporary storage tank or to a discharge
point at which a trailer may be located to receive the crop
from the harvester.Root crop harvesters or this type may be used to harvest
potatoes, or other root crops, and the cleaning / screening
action of the harvester separates unwanted material from the
crop by the way in which the dug-up material is handled, and
which usually involves both a screening action, and also a 
shaking action, so that small stones can become readily
separated from the crop, and also soil and clods, and in
addition the shaking action promotes separation of soil which
is adhering to the crop.It is known from GB 2 239 156 to provide a roller
separator table in which the angle of inclination of the table
can be adjusted, automatically, or under manual control, in
order to vary the residence time during which the material
discharged from the conveyor section undergoes treatment by the
rollers of the

<CLAIMS>
A root crop harvester (10) which comprises:

a forward crop-digger section (11);
a conveying section (12, 15) arranged to receive material
dug-up by said forward section (11) and to convey the material

rearwardly to a discharge position (16) while carrying out at
least partial separation of stone, clod and soil from the crop,

and a roller separator device (25) arranged to receive material
from the conveying section (12, 15) and to carry out further

cleaning of the crop;

   characterised by adjustment means which allows adjustment
of the discharge position (16) relative to the roller separator

(25, 25a).
A harvester according to Claim 1 characterised in
that the conveying section (12, 15) includes conveyor means

(15) having a discharge end (16) which is longitudinally
adjustable relative to the general axis of the harvester in

order to vary the position of the discharge end (16) relative
to the roller separator (25, 25a).
A harvester according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the discharge end (16) is adjustable relative to the

roller separator (25, 25a) between one position (16a) of
adjustment in which there is maximum contact with the surfaces

of the rollers (22) of the roller separator (25) suitable for
heavy soil conditions, and a further adjusted position (16b) in

which there is a reduced length of contact with the rollers of
the roller separator.
A harvester according to Claim 3 characterised in
that the discharge end (16) is adjustable to an extreme

position in which there is no contact with the rollers (22) of
the roller separator (25), which is effectively by-passed.
A harvester according to any one of
Claims 2-4, characterised in that said conveying section includes

an endless conveyor (15, 15a) having transfer rollers to guide
the endless path of the conveyor belt, and in which at least

some of the rollers are adjustable to permit adjustment of the
discharge end (16) between a maximum position (16a) and a 

minimum position (16b) of adjustment relative to the roller
separator (25, 25a).
A harvester according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the conveying section comprises a forward

sieving web (12) having an upper discharge end (14), and a
conveyor means (15) arranged to receive partly cleaned crop

material from the discharge end (14) of the sieving web (12).
A harvester according to Claim 6, characterised in
that said conveyor means (15) comprises an endless conveyor

(15); a set of removable guide rollers (30) arranged above the
roller separator (32), a guide plate, a vibratory plate;

vibratory rods or vibratory forks.
A harvester according to any one of the preceding
Claims and in the form of a potato harvester.
