<ABSTRACT>
A sensor for detecting an electrically conductive or magnetisable object has an oscillator comprising a resonant circuit which has an inductor and a capacitor and whose resonance circuit resistance depends on a damping separation between inductor and the object and rises steeply in the region of small damping separations, as rises a little less steeply in the region of medium damping separations and as an essentially constant value in the region of large damping separations, and a closed adaptive loop stage which supplies a loop current for the resonance circuit and which generates an amplitude value profile which depends on the damping separation, and has an evaluation circuit which detects an oscillator voltage present on the resonance circuit. In order to improve the sensor in such a way that the oscillator also oscillates in the region of small damping separations and exhibits a characteristic curve for which the oscillator voltage varies with the damping separation even in the region of small damping separations, it is proposed that the amplitude value profile of the loop current in the region of small damping separations has at least one vibration-receiving segment whose gradient is smaller than the gradient of the amplitude value profile in the range of medium damping separations.
