<ABSTRACT>
Flameproofed thermoplastic moulding compositions obtainable by mixing     A) from 20 to 70% by weight of mixtures of metal carbonates of metals from main group 2 of the Periodic Table and B) from 0 to 70% by weight of conventional additives and processing auxiliaries into a melt of C) from 10 to 80% by weight of a polyamide (nylon) prepolymer having a viscosity number of from 40 to 100 ml/g, and subsequently post-condensing the mixture in the solid phase.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a flameproofed 
thermoplastic molding material by mixing 


A) from 20 to 70% by weight of a mixture of carbonates 
of metals of the 

2nd main group of the 
Periodic Table of 

Elements
 
and 
B) from 0 to 70% by weight of conventional additives 
and processing 

assistants
 
in a melt of 
C) from 10 to 80% by weight of a polyester prepolymer 
having a viscosity 

number of from 40 to 
100 ml/g, measured in a 

0.5% strength solution 
in a 1:1 o-dichlorobenzene/phenol 

solvent 
mixture at 25°C,
 
and subsequently carrying out solid-phase postcondensation. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the solid-phase  
 

postcondensation is carried on until the 
polyester has a viscosity number of at least 

120 ml/g. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a 
mixture of 


a₁) a magnesium calcium carbonate of the formula

and 
a₂) a basic magnesium carbonate of the formula 
Mg
n
(CO₃)

 1 and
 
   w ≥ 0, 
 
is used as component A, the ratio of a₁) to a₂) 

being from 1:1 to 3:1.
