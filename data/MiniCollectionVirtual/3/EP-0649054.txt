<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method and 
apparatus for curtain coating a support with one or 

more layers of a liquid coating composition. Stripes 
of a liquid coating composition are formed at the edges 

of the free falling curtain. These stripes are guided 
by edge guides which are positioned so that there is an 

uncoated margin of support at each edge of the support. 
Liquid is removed from the edges of the free falling 

curtain near the point of impingement on the support. 
Drag that emanates from the edge guide is contained 

within the stripe which is removed thereby producing a 
more uniform coating. In addition free falling 

curtains having an extremely low flow rate can be 
coated that previously were not possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method and
apparatus for applying liquid compositions to a moving
web using the method known as curtain coating.In the curtain coating method for applying
liquid compositions to a moving web, one or more
distinct layers form a free-falling curtain and impinge
on a moving web thereby coating the web. The distinct
layer or layers may be formed by means of either a
slide or extrusion hopper as described in U.S. Patents
3,508,947 (Hughes) and 3,867,901 (Greiller). In order
to prevent contraction of the falling curtain, it is
necessary to provide edge guides at the longitudinal
edges of the curtain to maintain the width of the
curtain along its length. The edge guides can be
positioned outside the width of the web to be coated so
the entire width of the web is coated, or the edge
guides can be located inboard of the edges of the web
so as to leave an area of uncoated web at each
longitudinal edge. This is known as the "internal"
curtain coating edging process. The current state of
the art of the internal edging process shown in FIG. 1,
is described in U.S. Patent 4,830,887 to Reiter
assigned to Eastman Kodak Company.In U.S. Patent 4,830,887, a slide coating
hopper 10 has two bent slotted tubes 50 as the edge
guides. The tubes 50 are positioned so that the
coating width is less than the width of the web or
support 18. The free-falling composite curtain 12
extends transversely of the path of the moving support
18, drops over a height "h", and impinges onto the
moving support 18 to form a multilayer coating.
Support 18 is guided around a coating roller 8 where 
the curtain 12 impinges onto the support. A low
viscosity flushing liquid 21, preferably water, is
delivered at the top of the slotted edge guide 50 and
distributed over the entire height of the edge guide
from the coating edge 15 to the point where the slotted
edge guides bend upwardly, just above the point where
the curtain 12 impinges on the support 18. Figure 2 is
a cross-sectional view of the free-falling curtain 12,
showing the slotted edge guide 50 with the flushing
liquid 21. The width of the flushing solution 21
adjacent the free falling curtain is typically about
1-2 mm. At the bottom of the edge guide 50 a vacuum 53
removes substantially all of the flushing liquid 21 and
even a small amount of the free falling curtain 12
before the curtain impinges on the moving web or
support 18 as shown in Figure 3.Since the edge guides described above are
stationary, the falling curtain will experience drag in
the areas adjacent

<CLAIMS>
A method of curtain coating a support (116) with
one or more layers of a liquid coating composition

comprising:

moving the support along a path through a coating zone;
forming one or more flowing layers of coating liquids to

form a composite layer;
forming a free falling curtain (120) having a pair of
edges from said composite layer within said coating zone

which extends transversely of said path and impinges on
said moving support;
forming stripes (110) of liquid coating composition
having a viscosity from 1 to 30 cP contiguous

with each edge of said free falling curtain (120) wherein
the stripes are formed in the edge of said curtain and

issue from a horizontal edge substantially the width of
the stripes and positioned within 3 cm of the formation

of the free falling curtain (120);
laterally guiding said stripes (110) by edge guides (126)
arranged to coat less than a width of said support;

maintaining said stripes (110) in wetting contact with
said edge guides (126) by distributing flushing liquid

(108) from said edge guides (126) contiguous with said
stripes (110) wherein said stripes extend between each

edge of said free falling curtain and the flushing liquid
(108); and extracting liquids from the edge of said

falling curtain by a vacuum source at the impingement of
said falling curtain on said moving support (116) .
The method according to claim 1 wherein said
stripes (110) are completely removed during the

extraction of liquids from the edge of said falling
curtain (120).
The method according to claim 1 wherein said
stripes (110) are partially removed during the extraction

of liquid from the edge of said falling curtain (120).
The method according to claim 1 wherein the
stripe (110) is sufficiently wide to contain a drag layer

   at least one edge guide (126) extending from a top
of the falling curtain to said support, said at least

one edge guide including:

a solid horizontal edge positioned within 3 cm of the

   stripe formation means for supplying said edge with
coating composition and

for
