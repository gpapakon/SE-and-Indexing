<ABSTRACT>
An engine starting system including a control unit (20) which controls an engine starting sequence to prevent start attempts when the engine is running and regulates the starting function within a control range of revolutions for efficient use of the available starting power either in the form of pressurized fluid from a tank (2) or electrical discharge of a battery (2) to a starter motor (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to engine starting systems 
and more particularly to starting systems for air starters 
for use on vehicles and the like. In known air starting 
systems, the pressure fluid is applied to the starter and 
the starter operated at self governed speeds, limited by 
the available air pressure and starter mechanical design. 
In many cases, this resulted in inefficient utilisation of 
the available air pressure and occasionally cranking speeds 
in excess of manufacturer's recommendations. US-A-4 917 061 discloses an engine control means including 
a control device which is operative selectively to operate 
either a starting device for the engine or a kill device 
for stopping the engine. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
starter control system for an engine starter, comprising: 
means for sensing engine RPM; means for determining engine off condition RPM; and means for determining an engine running RPM;  
   characterised by means for determining a minimum 
cranking RPM and means for determining a maximum cranking 
RPM; 
there being control means for establishing a desired 
engine cranking and starting sequence in response to the 
condition sensed sequence response of the above listed 
means; and said means for sensing engine RPM comprising a 
proximity sensor registering engine RPM in pulses, said 
pulses being converted by a device to a voltage 
proportional to RPM. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how 
the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be 
made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in 
which:- 
Figure 1 is a schematic view illustrating an embodiment as 
applied to a vehicle engine starter;  
 Figure 2 is a partial schematic view showing a control 
circuit for the engine starter; Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view of a starter control 
valve; Figure 4 is a graph representing starter operation with and 
without the present control circuit in terms of operating 
RPM and tank pressure vs. time; and Figure 5 is a schematic control diagram for the engine 
starting system. Referring to Figure 1, a pneumatic pressure fluid or air 
starting system for a vehicle comprises a starter driven by 
the pneumatic pressure fluid having its output on a pinion 
gear 7 and connected to a pressure fluid source or tank 2 
by means of a hose or pipe 5 communicating through a valve 
assembly 3. Hose flange connections 4 and tank flange 
connection 6 are shown for convenience of assembly. It 
should be understood that
