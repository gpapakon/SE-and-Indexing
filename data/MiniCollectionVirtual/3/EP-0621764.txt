<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a ceramic inlay (10) for filling a cavity (16) in a tooth (18). A piece of metal foil (12) is pressed into a depression (52, 54, 56, 60, 70) in a jig (40), where the depression (52, 54, 56, 60, 70) approximates the shape of the cavity (16); the pressed metal foil (12) is annealed and the pressing and annealing steps are repeated until the foil (12) has a concave depression roughly the same size and shape as the cavity (16). A ceramic layer (14) is built up on the concave foil (12) to form a ceramic inlay (10) substantially reconstructing the tooth (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionCeramic Inlay And Process For Making SameTechnical FieldThis invention relates to an improved ceramic inlay for filling cavities in teeth. More specifically, this invention relates to an improved ceramic inlay for filling cavities in teeth comprising a layer of translucent ceramic material bonded to a foil layer.Background ArtInlays for filling cavities in teeth are frequently made of metal, such as silver. These inlays have relatively long lifetimes, but they are not aesthetically pleasing, being visible in the mouth as a gray area. Patients with pure metal inlays are frequently self-conscious when smiling or yawning. Because natural dentin is translucent and allows a significant amount of visible light to pass through it, metal inlays in the center of even large teeth, such as molars, can be visible as a grayish, dead-looking spot in the patient's mouth.One alternative to such solid metal inlays is the use of inlays made of plastic. While such plastic inlays are easy to work with and present acceptable aesthetic characteristics, such inlays have inferior wear characteristics. Plastic inlays wear extremely quickly, especially in occlusal inlays. 

 Another alternative is an inlay made of translucent ceramic material. These ceramic inlays are also aesthetically pleasing because ceramic is similar to the natural tooth structure. Thus, such inlays alleviate much of the patient's mental discomfort regarding mouth appearance. However, these ceramic inlays also have inferior strength characteristics. Because such inlays lack support, they tend to fracture after a few years of normal occlusions with opposing teeth. Moreover, inlays made of ceramic tend to fracture at the margin (the edge of the inlay adjacent the remainder of the natural tooth) . In such cases, it is likely that organic matter will become lodged between the fractured inlay and the remainder of the natural tooth, leading to further tooth decay.Disclosure Of InventionThe present invention provides an improved ceramic inlay. The ceramic inlay is made with a thin layer of foil bonded to the ceramic. This metal foil layer can remain as part of the inlay and can be removed, in whole or in part. The ceramic inlay is stronger that plastic inlays, stronger than previous ceramic inlays, and has better aesthetic properties than metal inlays. The layer of foil increases the strength of the inlay to a greater degree than expected for combining metal and ceramic. The inlay has a longer lifetime than ceramic inlays and even has a longer lifetime

 Claims
Having described the invention, what is claimed is:
1. A ceramic inlay for filling a cavity in a tooth, comprising: a baked ceramic layer, having an upper portion and a lower portion, said upper portion being a reconstruction of the outer surface of the tooth; and a layer of metal foil bonded to said lower portion of said baked ceramic layer said foil closely fitting the walls of the cavity in the tooth.
2. The ceramic inlay of Claim 1, wherein said baked ceramic layer comprises a translucent material, and wherein said layer of metal foil has one or more regions on said lower portion that is exposed.
3. The ceramic inlay of Claim 1, wherein the thickness of the foil layer is less than about 20 microns.
4. The ceramic inlay of Claim 1, wherein the thickness of the foil layer is less than about 10 microns.
5. A process for making a ceramic inlay for filling a cavity in a tooth, comprising the steps of: pressing a piece of metal foil into a depression in a jig, said depression approximate 


in shape to said cavity; annealing said pressed metal foil; repeating said pressing and annealing steps until said foil has a concave depression roughly the same size and shape as the cavity; and building up a ceramic layer on said concave foil to form a ceramic inlay substantially reconstructing the tooth.
6. The process of Claim 5, wherein said annealing is accomplished by heating;
7. The process of Claim 5, further comprising the step of: removing a strip of foil from said ceramic inlay.
8. A process for making a ceramic inlay for filling a cavity in a tooth, comprising the steps of: making a die of the cavity; pressing a piece of foil into a depression in a jig, said depression approximate in shape to said cavity; annealing said pressed metal foil; repeating said pressing and annealing steps until said foil has a concave depression roughly the same size and shape as the cavity; covering said die with said foil; subjecting said foil covered die to isostatic pressure to uniformly press said foil onto said die; removing said uniformly pressed foil 


from said die; and building up a ceramic layer on said concave foil to form a ceramic inlay substantially reconstructing the tooth.
9. A jig for forming concave depressions in foil, comprising: a flat surface, having a plurality of depressions, each depressions having substantially the same shape, and each depression having a different depth.
10. The jig of Claim 9, further comprising more than one set of said plurality of depressions, each set having a different shape.
11. The jig of Claim 10, wherein one set of depressions is substantially plus-like in shape and wherein another set of depressions is substantially round in shape.
