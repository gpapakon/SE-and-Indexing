<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a non-asbestos friction material 
comprising a phenolic or phenolic-modified resin (and in certain 

embodiments, silicon nitride particles) incorporated into a fibrous base 
material which is then impregnated with a silicone resin. The friction 

material is prepared by mixing the phenolic or phenolic-modified resin 
(and, in certain embodiments, silicon nitride particles) into an aqueous 

paper formulation, forming a porous fibrous base material, 
impregnating the fibrous base material with a silicone resin, and 

heating the impregnated material to cure the phenolic resin and the 
silicone resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making friction
materials and the friction materials produced thereby. In particular,
the non-asbestos friction material comprises a silicone resin
impregnated paper which is formed from an aqueous system which
includes raw paper pulp forming materials, at least one particulate
phenolic resin and, in certain embodiments, silicon nitride particles
and, optionally, other materials such as diatomaceous earth and
cashew nut oil particles. It is to be understood, however, that other
ingredients useful in friction paper formulations are compatible with
the present invention. The friction material is useful in high energy
applications and has an increased coefficient of dynamic friction over
conventional friction materials.New and advanced transmission systems and braking systems
are being developed by the automotive industry. These new systems
often involve high energy requirements. Therefore, the friction
materials technology must also be developed to meet the increasing
energy requirements of these advanced systems.The friction material must have high heat resistance in order to
be useful in the new transmission and braking systems. Not only
must the friction material remain stable at high temperatures, it must 
also be able to rapidly dissipate the high heat that is generated during
operating conditions.The high speeds generated during engagement and
disengagement of the new transmission and braking systems mean
that a friction material must be able to maintain a relatively constant
frictional engagement throughout the engagement and disengagement
of the friction material. It is important that the frictional engagement
be relatively constant over a wide range of speeds and temperatures
in order to minimize "grabbing" of materials during braking or
"shuddering" of the transmission system during power shift from one
gear to another.In particular, the new high energy friction material must be able
to withstand high speeds wherein surface speeds are up to about
12,000 feet/minute (3.7 km/minute). Also, the friction material must be able to
withstand high energy pressures up to about 700 psi (4.8 mPa). It is also
important that the friction material be useful under limited lubrication
conditions and also be able to withstand the extreme pressures and
speeds applied during use.Previously, asbestos fibers were included in friction materials.
