<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of addenda 
in silver halide photographic elements to improve heat 
stability. Photofinishers that use photosensitive paper 
to produce color prints desire short processing times 
in order to increase output. One way of obtaining 
rapid processing is to accelerate the development time 
by increasing the chloride content of the emulsions 
used in the photographic paper. However, as the 
chloride content of a photographic emulsion is 
increased, it becomes more difficult to obtain good 
invariant photosensitivity. One of the problems with silver chloride 
emulsions is their severe propensity to storage 
deterioration. Photographic emulsions that have a high 
silver chloride content are prone to fog increase due 
to high temperature and humidity during storage. These 
changes may vary from layer to layer resulting in color 
imbalance and a loss of quality of the print material. 
Attempts have been made to reduce fog formation during 
storage by addition of inhibitory agents to the silver 
halide emulsions. For example, U.S. Patents T866,036; 
2,440,110; 3,043,696; 3,057,725; 3,226,232; 3,397,986; 
3,447,925; and 3,761,277 describe the addition of 
organic disulfides to silver halide emulsions to lessen 
the tendency towards fog growth. High chloride content color print paper also 
has an undesirable sensitivity to temperature changes 
during exposure. For example, when the temperature upon 
exposure rises due to heat from the exposing element  
 
during printing, the print density changes if the 
printing conditions are left at the initial set values. 
This may result in prints varying in density that were 
exposed at the normal temperature. Very often, an 
increase in temperature during exposure of the paper may 
result in a selective increase in speed in one layer, for 
instance the cyan layer, over another light sensitive 
layer such as the magenta layer. This results in 
improper color balance of the color print, and requires 
the photofinisher to readjust his printing conditions in 
order to compensate for this density fluctuation. This 
results in a loss in operating efficiency. This deficiency in the use of high silver 
chloride color paper material is recognized in the art. 
In particular, EP 0 367,227 (1988) discusses reducing 
heat sensitivity by employing certain spectral 
sensitizing dyes in combination with mercapto azoles. 
However, these dye structures have not proved to be 
entirely satisfactory in terms of minimizing thermal 
sensitivity while still
