<ABSTRACT>
The supporting device is composed of a C-shaped guide element (1) and of a sliding element (2) which exhibits a load-attachment part (3). The free ends (4, 5) of the guide element (1) run at an obtuse angle with respect to one another and are overlapped by the sliding element (2). In a rotationally symmetrical manner with respect to the load-attachment part (3), the sliding element (2) exhibits flanks (6) running at an obtuse angle. Consequently, the sliding element (2) can pivot in all directions.

<CLAIMS>
A supporting device having a guidance element (1, 11), the cross-section of which is 
substantially of C-shaped construction, and having a sliding element (2, 12) which 

comprises a load application part (3, 13) which protrudes through the clearance 
between the free ends (4, 5, 14, 15) of the guidance element (1, 11), wherein the free 

ends (4, 5, 14, 15) of the guidance element (1, 11) run at an obtuse angle (A) to each 
other and the sliding element (2, 12) has flanks (6, 16) which are disposed 

symmetrically with respect to the load application part (3, 13), which overlap the free 
ends (4, 5, 14, 15) of the guidance element (1, 11) and which run at an obtuse angle 

(B), characterised in that the flanks (6, 16) of the guidance element (2, 12) are 
disposed with rotational symmetry with respect to the load application part (3, 13). 
A supporting device according to claim 1, characterised in that the sliding element 
(2, 12) is constructed as a bowed disc. 
A supporting device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the sliding 
element (2, 12) is rotatably attached to the load application part (3, 13). 
A supporting device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
sliding element (2, 12) is attached swivel-mounted to the load application part (3, 13). 
A supporting device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that an 
intermediate element (17) is disposed in the clear sectional cross-section of the 

guidance element (1, 11), and that an intermediate space (Z) which allows the flanks 
(16) of the sliding element (12) to be received is formed between the intermediate 

element (17) and the free ends (14, 15) of the guidance element (11). 
A supporting device according to claim 5, characterised in that the intermediate 
element (17) has a passageway opening (18), the clear width of which is larger than 

the external contour of the load application part (13).
