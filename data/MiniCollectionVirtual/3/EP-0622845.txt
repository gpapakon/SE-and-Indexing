<ABSTRACT>
An improved apparatus for tape automated bonding 
insulation including: a substrate (12); at least one 

electrical contact (18) on the substrate (12); an 
electrical lead (14) coupled to the electrical contact 

(18); and an insulator material (20) attached to the 
substrate 
(12) for insulating the electrical lead (14) 
from the substrate (12). In a specific embodiment the 

electrical contact (18) is a substantially flat and thin 
electrically conductive layer (18). In another specific 

embodiment the insulator material (20) is a polymer 
photomask material (20) laminated to the substrate (12) 

and etched to form a raised insulator (20). The improved 
apparatus for tape automated bonding insulation reduces 

cost and improves insulation reliatility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tape automated bonding and 
more particularly to insulation of tape automated bonding 
(TAB) circuits from integrated circuits. While the present invention is described herein with 
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular 
applications, it should be understood that the invention is 
not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in the 
art and access to the teachings provided herein will 
recognize additional modifications, applications, and 
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields 
in which the present invention would be of significant 
utility. Tape automated bonding (TAB) circuits are used for 
many applications including integrated circuit packaging 
and interconnection to integrated thermal inkjet 
printheads. TAB circuits are fabricated by plating copper 
or gold conductors and circuit traces onto a flexible 
polyimid substrate. In a typical application, the TAB 
circuits include beam leads that are welded to contact pads 
on an integrated circuit substrate to provide 
interconnection between the integrated circuit and the 
leads of a package. The TAB beam leads are copper leads 
that can be plated with gold and are generally rectangular 
in cross section.  A TAB lead must be insulated from an integrated 
circuit substrate, because the substrate itself is 
conductive and is used as a part of the circuit. During 
processing of a silicon wafer to fabricate integrated 
circuits, a glassy insulation layer is applied over the 
wafer; however, this layer cracks when the wafer is sawn 
into individual integrated circuit substrates, so is 
ineffective as an insulator. A conventional approach for providing insulation for 
a TAB beam lead is to plate a 0.001 inch gold bump onto the 
TAB beam lead to improve bonding reliability and to prevent 
electrical shorting. The bump on the TAB beam lead is 
attached to a flat contact pad on the integrated circuit 
substrate and the TAB beam lead is elevated by the bump, 
which prevents electrical shorting to the integrated 
circuit substrate. Unfortunately, the cost of using gold for this purpose 
is prohibitive for some consumer products. Inkjet printers 
such as those sold by Hewlett Packard Company typically 
include an inkjet pen having an array of nozzles. The 
inkjet pens are mounted in a carriage which is moved across 
a page in successive swaths. Each inkjet pen has heater 
circuits which, when activated, cause ink to be ejected 
from associated nozzles. The heater circuits are 
integrated onto an
