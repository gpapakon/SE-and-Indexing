<ABSTRACT>
The volume average diameter of relatively large rubber-like 
composite particles dispersed through out a continuous 

resin phase may be reduced by subjecting the syrup to a 
shear field. The application of a uniform shear field 

generator to the relatively large rubber-like composite 
particle syrup is particularly desirable since it gives a 

high degree of control over the size and distribution of the 
dispersed rubber-like composite phase. As a result it is 

possible to optimize the particle size distribution in an 
impact modified thermoplastic and obtain better or a better 

balance of properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process to improve 
the properties or balance of properties of impact modified 
thermoplastics. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a process that produces in the early part of the 
process a relatively large particle size rubber-like 
composite phase dispersed in a syrup comprising a continuous 
resin phase and then later in the process alters the 
particle size of all or part of the rubber-like composite 
phase dispersed in a syrup comprising a continuous resin 
phase. The field of the manufacture of impact modified 
plastics is relatively old and the current industrial 
processes for their manufacture are fairly well known. 
According to conventional technology typically a solution of 
rubber, typically comprising 1 to about 20, preferably from 
3 to 12 weight %, most preferably 4 to 10 weight % of rubber 
dissolved in one or more monomers is polymerized in a first 
stage reactor under mechanical agitation. Whether the 
polymerization occurs in a batch, stirred plug flow or 
continuous stirred tank reactors, almost all prior art and 
disclosures clearly teach that the particle size, particle 
size distribution and morphology of the dispersed rubber-like 
composite phase of the final product is largely  
 
determined during particulation in the early part of the 
process. Particulation is the generic term used to describe the 
formation of the dispersed rubber-like composite phase 
regardless of its mechanism. In the production of high impact polystyrene in a batch 
process or in a stirred plug flow reactor, the rubber-like 
composite phase is the continuous phase and the resin phase 
(monomer/resulting polymer phase) is dispersed. Typically, 
in conventional processes, as the polymerization proceeds in 
time with a batch reactor or in space with a stirred plug 
flow reactor at some point between 5 and 20 % conversion the 
system undergoes particulation by phase inversion under the 
application of a shear field generated by mechanical 
agitation. That is the rubber-like composite phase becomes 
the dispersed phase and the resin phase becomes the 
continuous phase. This does not happen instantaneously but 
occurs over a considerable period of time or space, 
typically from 20 to 50 minutes or reactor space which 
produces 2 to 8 % conversion. That is the rubber-like 
composite phase and resin phase become co-continuous for a 
period of time or space before the particulation process is 
complete. The ternary phase diagram of the
