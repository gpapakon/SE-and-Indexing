<ABSTRACT>
The pneumatic bellows (6) are clamped between the cover plate (4) and uncoiling piston (10) which is movable in relation to the cover plate. The movement of the piston is set by a curved track (16). During movement, the pneumatic spring uncoils on the piston to form an uncoiling fold.

<CLAIMS>
System (2) which comprises the following components:

an air suspension bellows (6), which is clamped
between a cover plate (4) and a roll-off piston (10)
a curved roll-off piston (10), which is arranged so
that it can move in relation to the cover plate (4)

of the air suspension bellows (6), the movement of
the roll-off piston (10) being predefined by a

curved path (16) and the curvature of the roll-off
piston (10), at least in some segments, having the

same orientation as the curvature of the curved path
(16), the air spring (6), under a movement of the

roll-of piston (10), forming a rolling lobe (20) and
rolling on said piston, 
characterized in that
the curved path (16) has a specific curvature at the
starting point (18), which with the roll-off piston

(10) drawn out of the air suspension bellows (6) is
formed by the centre of the rolling lobe (20), and

that the roll-off piston (10), at the end (32)
facing the cover plate (4), has a curvature which is

substantially smaller than the curvature at the
starting point (18) of the curved path (16), or that
the curvature of the roll-off piston (10) at the end
(32) facing the cover plate (4) is opposed to the

curvature at the starting point (18) of the curved
path (16).
System (2) according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the curvature centreline (30) of the roll-off piston
(10), at least in some segments, has the same radius

of curvature as the curved path (16).
