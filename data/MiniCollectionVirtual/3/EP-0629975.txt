<ABSTRACT>
A card having a paper as a base material laminated 
with decomposable plastic layers having such properties as 

durability, bending resistance, water resistance, chemical 
resistance, waterproofness, surface smoothness, glossiness 

and workability. Any visible information/design portion 
and/or a magnetic recording portion may be formed as 

required. The present invention improves the durability of a 
card using paper as a base material and provides the card 

which spontaneously decomposes even when left after being 
discarded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable card 
used for prepaid cards, admission tickets, or a disposable 
card-type material used for letters of guarantee, securities 
and the like, and more particularly to a card whose entire 
composition has decomposition properties. Currently, cards are utilized in wide fields such 
as ID cards or membership cards identifying social standing, 
cash cards, credit cards, prepaid cards, passes or traffic 
tickets having monetary values, or letters of guarantee, 
securities and the like. Cards which have increased most in the number of 
cards utilized among those as mentioned above are the 
so-called prepaid cards in which monetary value information 
has been recorded equivalent to a certain amount of money 
previously paid. Usually, such cards after being sold to users are 
discarded when users use up the full amount of money 
recorded. Generally such prepaid cards comprise plastics 
such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin as a card base  
 
material, in which pattern and character information are 
printed on the card base material, while digital information 
is recorded on a magnetic recording portion or an optical 
recording portion provided on the card base material. 
Although such plastic cards after being fully used are 
currently disposed of by incineration or by landfill as a 
waste, plastic waste, when being incinerated, causes burning 
temperature to become higher, leading to problems with the 
durability of incinerators and with the environmental 
pollution due to combustion gas, while plastic waste, when 
being used for landfill, does not decompose, remaining as it 
is, so that it remains permanently as refuse, leading to 
problems with the effect on natural environment. Heretofore, there have been produced and utilized 
cards employing paper as their base material, which paper is 
easy to be discarded for incineration or landfill and less 
expensive in manufacturing cost, so that paper has been 
considered to be an optimum card material with respect to the 
above-mentioned, currently-discussed environmental problems. Also recently, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Application No.57-150393, Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application No.59-220192, Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application No.51-93991, Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application No.63-260912 and Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application No.57-150393, plastics, which are decomposable  
 
under natural environment such as light or underground 
condition, have been developed, have used
