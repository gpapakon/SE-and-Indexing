<ABSTRACT>
A method for the manufacture of fiberboard according to the dry method starting with lignocellulose-containing material which is disintegrated, glued, dried, formed to a web and pressed. Prior to the defibering, the material is treated with an impregnation solution containing fiber surface activating chemicals and preheated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of board of 
lignocellulose-containing material, such as fiber board. Board of this kind is manufactured by disintegrating the 
material to particles containing fiber bundles and fibers. Glue 
is added to the disintegrated material and the material is dried 
and a web is formed which finally is pressed at increased 
temperature for curing the glue so that a board is formed. Fiber 
board is made of material which is disintegrated by defibering, 
i.e. of more or less free fibers. The binding agent normally used is urea formaldehyde 
glue, which is admixed to the disintegrated material. The amount 
of glue can be 6% or more. The glue is relatively expensive, and 
it is therefore desired to minimize the glue addition. A smaller 
amount of glue, however, deteriorates the strength of the 
completed board. In view thereof, the glue addition must be 
optimized. At the drying of the glued material, a great or small 
amount of water soluble formaldehyde is given off from the glue. 
After the separation of the drying gas from the fiber material, 
for example in a cyclone, the liquid content is condensed out of 
the gas. In conventional cleaning processes the water soluble 
formaldehyde then causes problems. The formaldehyde following 
along with the material to the final pressing also can cause 
problems when it is successively given off from the completed 
board. When glue is added to the material after its drying, the 
problem with formaldehyde separation arises at the pressing as 
well as from the completed board. Fiber board manufactured according to the dry method 
normally is called MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) and is a board 
product made of wood fiber. The yield exceeds 95%. The starting 
material preferably is wood chips, which are defibered with 
relatively low energy input, 100-500 kWh/ton fibers, for freeing 
the fibers. The defibered fiber material is glued, dried, formed 
to a web and pressed in a hot press. Alternatively, the material 
can be dried prior to the gluing. The material normally is 
preheated prior to the defibering to above 150°C whereafter the 
defibering is carried out under pressure at this high temperature  
 
in order to facilitate the freeing of the fibers. At such a high 
temperature, however, the material can be degradated and 
miscoloured due to occurring hydrolysis. A short heating time 
reduces this shortcoming, but miscolouring yet cannot be avoided, 
and at the same time the energy consumption increases. The urea formaldehyde
