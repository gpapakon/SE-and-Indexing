<ABSTRACT>
Amine functional polymers are purified to remove formate present by 
contact with a supported Group VIII metal hydrogen transfer catalyst under 

conditions favoring formate decomposition to carbon dioxide and hydrogen 
which are removed as gases. The preferred catalyst is palladium on carbon. 

Essentially salt-free poly(vinylamines) can be obtained by hydrolysis of 
polymers of N-vinylformamide in aqueous solution using ammonia or a 

volatile amine as a hydrolysis agent so that formate salts are the 
principal by-product of the hydrolysis which creates amine functionality in 

the polymer. Formate can then by removed by the catalytic decomposition 
described. Removal of carbon dioxide is enhanced by degassing the 

hydrolyzate prior to formate decomposition and by nitrogen purge of the 
polymer solution during the catalytic decomposition reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making amine functional 
polymers with improved purity. In another aspect it relates to the removal 
of contaminating material from hydrolyzed vinylamide polymers by catalytic 
decomposition of contaminants. Interest in amine functional polymers has grown rapidly in recent 
years owing to their demonstrated utility in a broad spectrum of operations 
which capitalize on their solubility in water and their reactivity under 
relatively mild conditions. Such polymers have found uses as flocculants, 
filtration aids, paper strengthening agents, in enhanced oil recovery and 
as crosslinking agents for epoxy resins and polyurethanes. As the 
commercial value of these polymers has become recognized, more and more 
attention has been devoted to developing polymers containing amine 
functionality but tailored to specific needs. Poly(vinylamine) (pVA) is perhaps the most promising of amine 
functional polymers because of its simplicity of manufacture and its 
versatility. Since its theoretical monomeric unit, vinylamine, is 
unstable, pVA is made indirectly by polymerizing a vinylamide, such as N-vinylformamide, 
and hydrolyzing the resulting polymer to develop its amine 
functionality. Complete hydrolysis is difficult if not impossible to 
achieve and it is well recognized that polymers made by this route and 
referred to as homopolymers of vinylamine are actually copolymers 
containing vinylamine units (perhaps as high as 98 mol percent) and N-vinylformamide 
units. A third unit, amidine, has also been recognized as 
an impurity which is to be minimized in order to increase primary amine 
functionality. It has been known for over a decade that hydrochloric acid hydrolysis 
of poly(N-vinylacetamide) does not produce an absolute homopolymer but a 
product containing both amine and amidine units resulting from the acid-catalyzed 
condensation of adjacent amine and acetamido groups. See J. P.  
 
Brown et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 26, 1300 (1983). This 
article, citing unpublished work of Dawson and Brock, states on page 1304 
that the amidine formation can be avoided by use of alkaline hydrolysis 
media. U.S. 4,393,174, Dawson et al. (1983) expands on the Brown et al. 
disclosure in describing the preparation of poly(N-vinylacetamide) and 
poly(N-vinylformamide) with subsequent hydrolysis to poly(vinylamine) which 
is useful in making polymeric dyes. It is pointed out that hydrolysis of 
the amide groups is not easy and has typically been carried out in 
refluxing
