<ABSTRACT>
A cathode structure for alkaline manganese dioxide-zinc primary or rechargeable cells with improved capacity that comprise manganese dioxide active material, a conductive powder and an additive material uniformly mixed and pressed to form a porous body, wherein the additive is a barium compound which is at least 3 % mass of the solid components. The preferred additive is barium oxide, barium hydroxide or barium sulphate. The invention relates also to alkaline manganese dioxide-zinc primary or rechargeable cells, wherein the cathode structure is employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements relating to alkaline 
manganese dioxide-zinc cells and more particularly to a cathode 
structure for alkaline manganese dioxide-zinc cells with improved 
capacity, which comprises as solid components manganese dioxide 
active material, a conductive powder and an additive material. The 
solid components are uniformly mixed and pressed to form a porous 
body and the pores thereof are filled with electrolyte when the 
cathode structure is used in a cell. Manganese dioxide is a widely used cathode material for alkaline 
primary batteries. Its rechargeability in alkaline solutions makes this 
material also attractive for rechargeable battery systems. Electrolytic 
manganese dioxide exhibits a limited rechargeability as disclosed by K. 
Kordesch et al, in Electochim. Acta, 26 1495 (1981) corresponding to 
the depth of discharge and this fact decreases the available capacity 
in practice. The optimization of the cathode structure has long been the 
objective of various development activity. U.S. patent 4,384,029 
issued to K. Kordesch et al deals with the properties of the 
manganese dioxide cathode material and with the composition of the 
cathode mix. The cathode structure is made of a mixture of 
electrolytic manganese dioxide powder as active material and graphite 
powder or colloidal graphite, and the mix is kept together either by a 
binding agent and/or by the application of pressure. The graphite 
has the task of improving conductivity. The addition of further 
materials like polymers or co-polymers of styrene, butadiene, 
acrylonitrile, urea, formaldehyde, vinyl alcohol, or epoxy resins was 
suggested. These materials called generally as "additives" had the 
purpose of improving the structure and of decreasing the swelling of 
the cathode material during cycling. A requirement generally imposed  
 
to such additives was that they had to be wettable by the electrolyte. 
Experience had shown that despite the presence of these additives in 
the cathode the cell voltage after a number of cycles decreased. In U.S. patent 4,929,520 issued to K. kordesch et al the use of 
conducting washers was suggested between contacting blocks of the 
cathode body, whereby the internal resistance of the cell was 
decreased to a significant extent. A further concern connected with the design of the cathode 
structure is the problem of hetaerolite formation which reduces the 
active manganese dioxide mass during the cycle life of the cell. This 
phenomenon has been discussed widely in
