<ABSTRACT>
The transistor comprises a buried base P 
region (13), a buried emitter N+ region (14) with 

elongate portions (fingers), deep contact P+ base 
regions (15), emitter N+ interconnection regions 

(16,17) serving balancing resistor functions, and base, 
emitter, and collector surface contact electrodes. To 

provide a higher current gain and a larger safe 
operation area, with each emitter "finger" (14) there 

are associated a screening P region (22) interposed 
between the "finger" (14) and a part (16) of the 

respective N+ interconnection region, and a contact N+ 
region (17A) which extends to the "finger" and is 

surface connected to the screening P region (22) by a 
dedicated electrode (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monolithic 
integrated semiconductor devices, and in particular to 
a vertical bipolar power transistor with buried base 
and interdigitated geometry as defined in the preamble of claim 1. A bipolar transistor of this type is 
described in EP 0 544 364, published on 02.06.93, based on the Italian Patent Application MI91A/03159 
filed by the Applicant on 26.11.91. This is 
manufactured using a process known as VIPower (a 
trademark of SGS-THOMSON MICROELECTRONICS s.r.l.) and 
described in European Patent Application EP-322040 by 
SGS-THOMSON MICROELECTRONICS s.r.l., which is specially 
conceived to provide integrated structures including 
power devices and signal processing circuitry for 
controlling the power devices. Shown in Figure 1 of the 
accompanying drawings is a sectional view of a portion 
of an integrated structure described in the above-cited 
publication EP 0 544 364. The structure manufacturing process can be 
summarized as follows. Formed by epitaxial growth on a 
substrate 10 of monocrystalline silicon, as heavily 
doped with impurities of the N type, is a first layer 
11 having the same type of N conductivity but a lower 
concentration of impurities. Note that the 
concentrations of N-type and P-type impurities are  
 
customarily denoted by adding the sign "+ "or the sign 
"-" to the characters N and P; the characters N and P 
with no "+" or "-" sign added denote concentrations of 
medium value. Formed by implantation on the surface of 
the epitaxial layer 11 are P-type regions having a 
comparatively low impurity concentration, followed by 
N-type regions having high impurity concentrations and 
being implanted over said P-type regions. A second 
layer 12 of the N type having a higher concentration of 
impurities than the first layer 11 is then formed over 
the layer 11 by epitaxial growth. During this step, 
which is carried out at a high temperature, the 
implanted regions of the P type and the N type spread 
through the two epitaxial layers to produce buried 
regions, as respectively indicated at 13 and 14 in the 
drawings, which form together a junction and are to 
provide the base region and emitter region, 
respectively, of the bipolar power transistor. Formed then in the second epitaxial layer 12. 
using conventional masking and diffusion techniques, 
are regions of the P type which have high 
concentrations of impurities, indicated at 15, 
through-penetrating the second epitaxial layer 12 to 
join the region 13 and constitute the deep contact base 
regi
