<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device has a multi-stage power amplifier,
which is composed of an input stage transistor (100a;200a)

having an input terminal and an output stage transistor
(100b,200b) having an output terminal. The input stage

transistor and output stage transistor are disposed on the
same chip in such a way that the input terminal (1a) of the

input stage transistor is arranged in a direction opposite
to that of an input terminal (1b) of the output stage

transistor. A ground metallization layer (5) is formed on
a back and a side surface and on an outside perimeter

section of a front surface of the chip and a ground terminal
(2a,2b) of each transistor is connected to the ground

metallization layer. Each of the input stage transistor
(100a;200a) and the output stage transistor (100b) comprises

a gate pad (1a;1b), a source pad (2a;2b), a drain
pad (3a;3b) and an active region (4a) which are formed on a

semi-insulating substrate (10). The gate pad (1a;1b), the
source pad (2a;2b) and the drain pad (3a;3b) are in contact

respectively with a gate, a source and a drain electrode
formed in the active region (4a). All transistors constituting

an ultra-high frequency multi-stage power amplifier
are implemented onto a single chip, thus enhancing device

miniaturization and preventing undesirable oscillation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
device for forming a power amplifier, and more particularly 
to a semiconductor device for forming a multi-stage ultra 
high frequency power amplifier. A conventional multi-stage power amplifier of the kind 
to which the present invention relates is described with 
reference to and by example of a two stage power amplifier. 
Fig. 1A is an outline of the constitution of a conventional 
power amplifier and Fig. 1B is an equivalent circuit diagram 
thereof. The power amplifier shown in Figs. 1A and 
1B is provided with an input matching circuit 7, a driver 
transistor 300 constituted from a MES (Metal-semiconductor) 
type field effect transistor, an inter-stage matching 
circuit 8, a final or output stage transistor 400 constituted 
from a plurality of MES type field effect transistors, 
and an output matching circuit 9. The driver and 
final stage transistors 300, 400 are discrete components, 
and are mounted together with the respective matching 
circuits 7, 8 and 9 on a wiring circuit board.  This type of multi-stage power amplifier is used in 
great quantities in the power module etc. of cellular 
handheld telephones and, recently, components for such uses 
have been subjected to strong demands for miniaturizing and 
cost reduction. But, because conventional multi-stage 
power amplifiers use discrete power transistors at each 
stage, the size of the whole power amplifier, including the 
matching circuits, on the wiring circuit board becomes 
inevitably large. Also, in the conventional examples, a 
large number of components, a wiring circuit board with a 
large surface area, a large number of assembly and processing 
stages, all make cost reduction difficult. Also, in 
the conventional examples, particularly when miniaturizing, 
oscillation becomes more likely because of the difficulty 
in obtaining sufficient isolation between the previous and 
subsequent stages. A feature of an embodiment to be described is the 
provision of an improved semiconductor device for forming 
a multi-stage ultra high frequency power amplifier. In a particular embodiment to be described below as 
an example, a semiconductor device is provided where on 
the same chip, a plurality of transistors  
 
for forming a multi-stage power amplifier are arranged such 
that input terminals and output terminals of the respective 
transistors are arranged in directions so as to alternate 
one another and, furthermore, each transistor's ground 
terminal is short-circuited with the ground
