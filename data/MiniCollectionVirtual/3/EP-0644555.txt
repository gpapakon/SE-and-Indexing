<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a method for preparing the inorganic 
hardenable slurry and the use of same in the solidification of wastes. In 

addition to water, the essential parts of the slurry are inorganic components 
including borates, cement-base powder and other additives such as magnesium 

oxide, gypsum and silica. The solidification of the slurry is resulted mainly 
from reaction of borates and the cement-base powder and to obtain a best 

result the weight of borates must be the same as that of the cement-base 
powder or even higher than the weight of the latter. 
 
The present invention also teaches a method for solidifying wastes with this 
hardenable slurry, i.e. to proceed solidification by admi
xing the various 
radioactive or non-radioactive dry and wet wastes with the hardenable slurry, 

or by burying waste pellets with the slurry.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the final step of treatment of low level radioactive 
wastes (LLW) generated in the nuclear power plants, it is 
generally to make the waste into solid form which is then 
transported to an intermediate storage site for interim storage, 
or directly to a final disposal site for final disposal. 
Solidification is the most important step in the treatment 
processes, it is to confer upon the wastes long-term chemical 
and physical stabilities and to offer a higher strength to 
facilitate transportation and management. Since, solidification 
process determines the volume of the solidified waste, when the 
final disposal cost is mainly determined by the volume of the 
waste form, the over-all cost of the management is consequently 
again determined principally by the volume efficiency of solidification. 
Currently, among the solidification methods for LLW, 
the most frequently used are the three methods of cement 
solidification, plastic solidification and bitumen solidification, 
each of the three methods having its own advantages and disadvantages. 
Generally speaking, the cementitious waste form possesses 
excellent long-term stability; however, the cement solidification 
method has a low volume efficiency. On the other hand, while 
volume efficiency of the plastic solidification method is high 
and the plastic-solidified waste form possesses a high strength, 
its long-term stability remains, however, doubtful. Again, in 
the bitumen solidification method the volume efficiency is high, 
the strength of the bitumen-solidified waste form is, nevertheless,  
 
low and the waste form is also flammable. The current solidifications 
methods are, therefore, still far from perfection 
and in many areas need for improvements. Judging from the 
nature of these solidification methods, the long-term stability 
of the cement-solidified waste form communicates to the mind 
of people a very important security in relation to the storage 
requiring a period of over several hundred years. Hence, it 
has become a very urgent task to improve the volume efficiency 
of the cement solidification method in order to reduce the 
over-all cost in the management of LLW. Accordingly, it is the purpose of the present invention to 
disclose a method for preparing a hardenable slurry in which 
the solidifying agent used is an inorganic cement-base powder 
whereby the solidified waste form has a long-term stability. 
The hardenable slurry may be utilized in the solidification of 
various radioactive and non-radioactive wastes of any
