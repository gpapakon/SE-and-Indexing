<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of and a device for detecting pulsatory interference signals
in a sound signal, comprising reception of samples of the sound signal and storage of a
given sample and samples received subsequent to the given sample.In GB-A2 162 408 a circuit arrangement for
implementing a method of this type is described, which method comprises detection of
peaks in an electrical signal, determination of a running average value of the detected peaks,
delay of the detected peaks, and comparison of these delayed peaks with the running
average value. According to this known method a pulsatory interference signal is detected
each time the comparison shows that one of the delayed peaks is larger than a times the
running average value, whereby a is a constant which is greater than unity.It is an object of the invention as defined by the appended independent claims 1 and 6 to provide another method of detecting
pulsatory interference signals. The method according to the invention is characterized in
that the method further comprises additional storage of a predetermined number of samples received previous to the
given sample, comparison of the level of the given sample with that of the previous
samples and the subsequent samples, and identification of the given sample as a pulsatory
interference based on the comparison of the level of the given sample with the levels of
the previous samples and the subsequent samples.The method according to the invention is based on the presence of sampled
signals and is thus particularly suitable for use in the field of digital sound signal
processing.The invention may be realised, for example, by determining the average
value of the rectified levels of said previous and subsequent signal samples and by
subsequently computing the ratio of the level of the given signal sample and this average
value. If this ratio is larger than a predetermined value, for example 2, the given sample 
will be identified as an interference pulse, or as a pulse associated with an interference
pulse.A preferred method according to the invention which is more reliable in the
sense that a larger number of the interference pulses present is identified as such and that
fewer parts of the useful signal are identified as interference pulses is characterized by
identification of the given sample as a pulsatory interference if the level of said sample,
multiplied by a predetermined factor (α) which is smaller than 1, is larger than the level
of at least 60% of said previous and subsequent
