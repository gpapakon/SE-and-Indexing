<ABSTRACT>
The rotor (10) has a number of polarised magnets (12) alternating with magnetisable collector elements (14) in a number of concentric rings, attached to a rotor disc (18), which is secured to the rotor axis (30). The fixing elements (22) project through the polarised magnets and are secured to an insulation ring (26) secured to the rotor disc. Pref. the polarised magnets have axial bores for the fixing elements, or are arranged in pairs in a radial direction with a gap between them for the fixing elements. The latter may comprise screws, bolts, or rivets.

Rotor arrangement for an electric machine, in particular a 
transversal-flow machine, in which the rotor (10) comprises in 

the peripheral direction a plurality of polarised magnets (12; 12a, 
12b) and magnetisable collector elements (14) in alternating 

succession in an annular arrangement, and in which the rotor 
(10) comprises in the axial direction a rotor plate (18), which is 

mountable to the rotor axis (30) and to which the polarised 
magnets (12; 12a, 12b) and the magnetisable collector elements 

(14) are attached in a respective concentric annular 
arrangement, 
characterised in that
 the mounting is carried out 
by means of mounting elements (22) which pass through the 

polarised magnets (12; 12a, 12b) and are attached to the rotor 
plate (18) or an axially distanced annular insulating element (26) 

which is connected to the rotor plate (18). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
polarised magnets (12; 12a, 12b) either have axial throughbores 

or are arranged in the radial direction in pairs and separated 
from each other by a gap (32) which is passed through by the by 

the shaft of the mounting elements (22). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 
the annular insulating elements (26) and the annular end 

elements (28) which are positioned axially outside are provided 
with axial recesses (36) which form abutments for the heads 

(24) of the mounting elements (22). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised 
in that
 the mounting elements (22) are in the form of screws, 
bolts or rivets. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised 
in that
 the respective annular insulating elements (26) and/or 
the rotor plate (18) are provided with threads or threaded inserts 

(34) to accommocate bolts (22). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised 
in that
 the collector elements (14) are clamped in the axial  
 

direction between the rotor plate (18) and in annular insulating 
element (26) or between a pair of annular insulating elements 

(26) or between an annular insulating element (26) and an 
axially outer annular end element (28) and arranged in the 

peripheral direction between the mounting elements (22). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised 
in that
 the collector elements (14) are in the form of sheet metal 
soft iron parts which are layered in the axial direction. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised 
in that
 the annular insulating elements (26) are made of a 
plastic material. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised 
in that
 the components of the rotor arrangement are additionally 
connected to glued parts and/or positively interengaging parts. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised 
in that
 the arrangement comprises a rotor plate (18) of non-magnetisable 
material arranged in the axial direction in the 

middle, and on both sides at least one annular arrangement with 
alternating collector elements (14) and polarised magnets (12; 

12a, 12b), and that the annular arrangements are on the one 
side peripherally offset by one pole relative to those of the 

opposite side, and that the mounting elements (22) are provided 
so as to be alternatingly offset by each one pole from both sides 

of the rotor (10). 
Arrangement according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
, with 
an arrangement of two respective annular arrangements on both 

sides of the rotor plate (18), the mounting elements (22) 
alternately and peripherally attach to the rotor plate (18) the 

axially inner polarised magnets (12; 12a, 12b) and the annular 
insulating elements (26) as well as the axially outer polarised 

magnets (12; 12a, 12b) and the axially outer annular end 
elements (28) to the annular insulating elements (26). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised 
in that
 the mounting elements (22) pass through at least two  
 

axially successive annular arrangements whilst passing through 
the polarised magnets (12; 12a, 12b) and a respective annular 

insulating element (26) positioned thereinbetween in the axial 
direction, and that the mounting elements (22) are in the 

peripheral direction electrically insulated from each other and 
engage on the one side an annular end element (28) and on the 

other side the rotor plate (18). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised 
in that
 the mounting elements (22) are electrically insulated 
against each other as well as against the polarised magnets (12; 

12a, 12b) and against the collector elements (14),
