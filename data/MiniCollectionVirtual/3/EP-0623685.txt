<ABSTRACT>
Process and apparatus for improving fluxing gas dispersion in treating 
molten aluminum by increasing the fluxing gas surface area. The process includes the 

use of a molten body of aluminum and a gas dispersing unit in the body of molten 
aluminum, the dispersing unit having at least two, upper and lower dispersers (rotors) 

mounted on a shaft extending into the molten aluminum. The dispersing unit is rotated, 
and simultaneously with the rotating, a fluxing gas is added to the molten aluminum 

adjacent the lower disperser. The fluxing gas is dispersed by the lower disperser to 
provide finely divided bubbles and then re-dispersed with the upper disperser to 

effectively increase the fluxing gas surface area in the molten body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluxing processes that remove impurities from 
molten aluminum. More particularly, the invention relates to mechanical stirrers for 
removing impurities such as entrapped gases from molten aluminum. It has long been appreciated in the aluminum industry that sound 
products and good operating economics require treatment of molten metal to reduce 
certain types of defects in the product made from the metal caused by impurities in the 
metal prior to casting the metal. This is especially true for ingots which are 
subsequently worked to produce wrought products. One impurity commonly 
encountered is gas entrapped or dissolved in the metal during its melting and transfer. 
The gas is primarily hydrogen probably generated by moisture contacting the aluminum 
while molten. Likewise oxygen is acquired on the surface of molten aluminum which 
oxidizes the aluminum quite readily. Upon solidification of the metal, a considerable 
amount of gas and oxide particles are trapped within the metal. In subsequent 
fabrication, such entrapped impurities develop voids or discontinuities within the 
fabricated product that create weak areas in the product. The problem becomes more 
acute in high strength aluminum devices where voids and discontinuities not only 
create areas of weakness but can give rise to further defects, as explained below, 
which may constitute sufficient cause to reject the devices. Other impurities commonly present in aluminum are dissolved trace 
elements, e.g., sodium, calcium, and lithium. This is introduced in the smelting process 
or in remelting of scrap metal. While trace elements, in the amounts generally 
encountered in aluminum, may not create severe difficulties in the final product itself, 
even miniscule amounts of trace elements give rise to serious problems in rolling and  
 
other drastic working operations especially in alloys 
containing magnesium. For instance, as little as 
0.001% sodium or calcium can cause very serious edge 
cracking in the hot rolling of aluminum slabs, 
containing 2 to 10% magnesium, in a reversing mill. It has been found that if the sodium and 
calcium content can be reduced to 0.0002% or less and 
especially to 0.0001% or less, on a commercial rather 
than mere laboratory basis, marked improvements in hot 
rolling can be realized such that heavy reductions of 
20% or more per roll pass at temperatures of about 
750Â°F. or more can be readily employed even on 
relatively thick stock without excessive edge cracking.
