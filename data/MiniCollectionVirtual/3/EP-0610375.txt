<ABSTRACT>
A power transmission system in a vehicle, where mechanical power transmission is utilized within one range of speed and hydrostatic power transmission within another range of speed and in which vehicle there is a joint engine (1) as a driving power source for both power transmissions. In the hydrostatic power transmission system of a vehicle or a working machine there are at least two hydraulic pumps and at least two hydraulic motors in order to produce two or more ranges of slowest speed and the highest range of speed of the vehicle is effected by coupling the engine to the driving wheels of the vehicle by means of mechanical power transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for transmission of 
power from the engine to the wheels in a vehicle or a working 
machine. Generally known in working machines are hydraulic hub 
motors, which function directly as a collar bearing and a 
fastening flange of the wheels and also rotate the wheels. By 
said means it is easy to arrange the drive both for the 
turning and fixed wheels. Hydraulic power transmission is 
usually utilized in slow-speed working machines, where a 
hydraulic function is needed for many other purposes. The 
speed of rotation of the hydraulic motor is adjusted by 
altering the speed of fluid. The hydraulic motor is not adaptable to a great speed 
range of wheel rotation without lessening the efficiency. 
Thus, if a hydraulic motor has a great torsion at small 
speeds, especially in working machine operation, its 
efficiency is reduced when the vehicle is transported at 
greater speeds on roads by the same motor construction. The 
efficiency is, therefore, not as good as a mechanical power 
transmission. In the above case, the solutions in the German 
publications 1113639 and 1153268 are referred to. Further, in 
the Swiss patent 494140 a hydrostatic power transmission is 
also used even at the greatest speed and always with engaged 
four wheel drive. By means of the system according to the main claim a 
decisive improvement is achieved compared to the above 
described disadvantages. According to the invention, the hydraulic pump and the 
hydraulic motors are coupled to allow a slow speed in which 
several wheels are driven with a rather great torsional 
moment. Changing the coupling provides a greater speed of 
fluid for each hydraulic motor, thereby increasing the speed 
of the driving wheels. The greatest speed is reached while 
transmitting the power mechanically to the driving wheels and 
bypassing the hydraulic system. The mechanical power  
 
transmission is simply achieved with a toothed coupling, such 
that the clutch behind the motor can be omitted. Damage in 
the power transmission on coupling can be prevented by 
constructing the toothed coupling to prevent incorrect timing 
of the coupling. The hydraulic motors placed in the wheels 
during power transmission, which in this inventional 
construction are radial piston motors, switch to free 
rotation, such that they brake only by means of their bearing 
friction, while radial piston motors, which are-generally used 
as driving engines, brake much more in their idle state 
causing a remarkable drop in efficiency. By a
