<ABSTRACT>
Method of coverage of shadow regions in a radio communications network, comprising at least:   - a base transmitting/receiving station for transmitting and receiving, on different frequencies (fP1, fP2, f'P1, f'P2), called base frequencies, radio signals intended for and originating from mobile units, - a radio repeater for receiving, amplifying and retransmitting these radio signals intended for and originating from at least one shadow region, the said method being characterised in that: - a radio signal received by a radio repeater originating from the base station and carried by a base frequency (fP2) is retransmitted to a mobile unit on a frequency (fR12), called transposed frequency, which is different from the base frequency (fP2) and associated with the latter according to a transposition relationship such that, on the one hand, each of the base frequencies (fP1, fP2, f'P1, f'P2) is either associated with at least one transposed frequency (fR11, fR12, f'R11, f'R12), or is not associated with any transposed frequency, and, on the other hand, the difference between the value of a transposed frequency and the value of the associated base frequency is not the same for all the transposed frequencies, - conversely, a radio signal received by a radio repeater originating from a mobile unit and carried by a transposed frequency (f'R12) is retransmitted to the base station on the associated base frequency (f'P2).
