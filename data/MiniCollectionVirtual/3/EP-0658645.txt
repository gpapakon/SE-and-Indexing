<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a washing machine or dryer equipped with a protective sleeve connecting its aperture to the tub. The machine (1) comprises means (31) for reducing the excess pressure within the protective sleeve (2) which is attributable to the movement of the tub (4). The means (31) consist, for example, of a communication of air between the upper part of the interior of the tub (4) and the outside of the tub. The invention is used in all types of washing machines or dryers having a protective sleeve.
