<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a harpsichord mechanism for a piano having strings (13) each with an associated key (11), hammer (12) and damper (17), the damper (17) being lifted off the string (13) by depression of the key (11), said mechanism comprising, for each string (13), a plectrum-holding jack (24) movable with respect to the string (13) so that the plectrum (25) plucks the string (13) while the damper (17) is lifted off the string (13) by depression of the key (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
 KEYBOARDMECHANISMThis invention relates to a keyboard mechanism.A harpsichord is in many regards similar to a piano, but has a plucking action as opposed to a striking action which causes the strings to emit a different kind of sound. There are however other, more subtle, differences which affect the construction and the sound of the instruments. The harpsichord is very- much a serious musician's instrument, whereas the piano may perhaps be termed as a general purpose instrument with, of course, a sound musicological history through a more recent development. In short, the instruments are very different despite the obvious similarities.'The present invention enables a piano inter alia, however, to perform the double role.There is, in view of the above considerations, some prejudice against the attempt, of course, it being thought among serious musicians that no piano could even be made to sound like any actual harpsichord. Then there is the problem, once the idea is conceived and accepted, of how to do it, how to modify the hammer action of a piano so as to emulate, however imperfectly, a harpsichord action to produce, however imperfectly again, a harpsichord sound. 

 The present invention provides inter alia a harpsichord mechanism for a piano which, overcoming the prejudice, solves the practical problems.The invention comprises in one aspect a harpsichord mechanism for a piano having strings each with an associated key, hammer and damper, the damper being lifted off the string by depression of the key, said mechanism comprising, for each string, a plectrum- holding jack movable with respect to the string so that the plectrum plucks the string while the damper is lifted off the string by depression of the key.The plectrum may pluck the string adjacent the damper. The jack may be moved by a damper-lifter.The mechanism may comprise a jack-rack having guides for the jacks with a jack return arrangement. Each guide may form a yoke containing a jack return spring; each jack may have a spring-engaging clip captive within the yoke. However, the jack return arrangement may operate by gravity, so that a conventional harpsichord jack may be used.The mechanism may comprise a hammer disabling arrangement, which may comprise a wedge interposable between elements of the hammer-operating lever arrange- 

ment to cause the hammer to stop short of the string when the key is depressed. The hammer-operating lever arrangement may be of the type which includes a backcheck arrangement which constrains hammer movement and

 CLAIMS
1. A harpsichord mechanism for a piano having strings each with an associated key, hammer and damper, the damper being lifted off the string by depression of the key, said mechanism comprising, for each string, a plectrum-holding jack movable with respect to the string so that the plectrum plucks the string while the damper is lifted off the string by depression of the key.
2. A mechanism according to claim 1, in which the plectrum plucks the string adjacent the damper.
3. A mechanism according to claim 1, in which the jack is moved by a damper-lifter.
4. A mechanism according to claim 1, comprising a jack rack having guides for the jacks each guide forming a yoke containing a jack return spring.
5. A mechanism according to claim 4, in which each jack has a spring-engaging" clip captive within the yoke.
6. A mechanism according to claim 1, comprising a hammer disabling arrangement. 


7 . A mechansim according to claim 6, in which said hammer disabling arrangement comprises a wedge interpos- able between elements of the hammer-operating lever arrangement to cause the hammer to stop short of the string when the key is depressed.
8. A mechanism according to claim 6, in which the hammer-operating lever arrangement includes a backcheck arrangement which 
*"
constrains hammer movement and the hammer disabling arrangement causes the backcheck arrangement to stop the hammer short of the string.
9. A mechanism according to claim 6, in which the hammer disabling arrangement and the rest of the harpsichord mechanism are interconnected so that the hammers are disabled when the harpsichord mechanism is engaged.
10. A mechanism according to claim 6, in which the hammer disabling mechanism is operable independently of the harpsichord mechanism.
11. A mechanism according to claim 1, having a disabling arrangement. 


12. A mechanism according to claim 11, in which the jack is, when the mechanism is operative, moved by a damper-lifter via a pivoted rod, and the rod is pivotable out of the way of the damper-lifter.
13. A mechanism according to claim 1, in which the hammers are shiftable with respect to the strings by a soft pedal so that, where each string is multiple, the hammer strikes only one string of the multiple set, and in which the plectrum for each such string can simultanÂ¬ eously pluck an unstruck string of the multiple set.
