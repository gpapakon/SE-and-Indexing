<ABSTRACT>
Device for guiding the front edge of a sheet (1) 
to be multi-folded on itself having, parallel with the 

rectilinear path (2-3) of feeding of the sheet, an elastically 
flexible lamellar means (6). Such lamellar 

means (6) takes two positions, an operative position in 
which the lamellar means is moved forward to the outlet 

point of the sheet from the feeding path (2-3), the lamellar 
means end (15) being bent, with bending shape memory, 

at said outlet point of sheet (1) in the same directions 
the sheet front edge of the sheet is to be deviated 

to, to guide the latter towards a folding unit (10,7) and 
a rest position in which the lamellar means (6) is brought 

again to the initial retracted position in such a way that 
the bent part (15) of the lamellar means (6) does not hinder 

the movements of the sheets during the folding phase 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device 
suitable for guiding in a precise manner in a desired 
direction, in a paper sheet folding machine, the 
leading edge of a sheet to be multi-folded, 
accordion-like, onto itself, during the initial sheet 
folding phase, and to a folding machine provided with 
such a device. A folding machine for sheets having a 
considerable length and width, suitable for folding 
said sheets many times onto themselves in one or both 
directions so as to obtain an accordion-like or 
zigzag folded sheet, is described, for instance, in 
Italian Patent NÂ° 2,083,484 and in the corresponding 
EP-A-0 171 486 of the applicant. The main problem in folding machines is to 
provide a means which can assure that the leading 
edge of the sheet to be multi-folded onto itself, be 
precisely directed towards the folding unit during 
the initial phase of forming the first fold. In 
actual fact if the leading edge is not guided in a 
precise and reliable manner in the desired direction  
 
and along the pre-established path, the subsequent 
folds, will be faulty, namely they will show dog-eared 
corners, wrinkles or other defects due to the 
leading edge of the sheet to be folded having, in the 
initial phase, possibly hit againts an element of the 
folding unit or other undesired obstacle. Such problem was solved, both in the above-mentioned 
patents and in other folding machines, in a 
more or less satisfactory manner. In EP-A-0 171 486 of the Applicant, the 
content of which is incorporated herein by reference, 
the device for directing in a precise way the leading 
edge of the sheet consists of a roller RO located in 
the advancing path of the sheet to be folded. Said 
roller, rotating in the feed direction of the sheet, 
cooperates in directing in a precise manner the 
leading edge of the sheet towards the first folding 
phase, thereby avoiding right from the start 
undesirable folds. Immediately afterwards the roller RO is shifted 
into its lower position so as not to hamper the 
subsequent folding phases, while it must return to 
its original position at the start of the folding of 
a new sheet. This device, though solving this problem in a  
 
satisfactory manner, is very costly inasmuch as it 
implies a fairly complex mechanical solution in order 
to move, alternatingly and rapidly, a heavy mass such 
as that constituting of roller RO, of its pivot and 
of its driving organs, and it demands frequent 
servicing. As it is known, sheet folding machines 
work at a very high speed. The

A device for precisely guiding in the desired 
direction, the leading edge of a sheet (1) to be multi-folded 

accordion-like on itself in the initial 
folding phase, performed by a sheet folding machine, 

the folding machine including rollers (4, 5) for feeding, 
along an advancing path (2, 3), a sheet to be 

folded, and a folding unit (7, 10, 11) to fold the 
sheet many times onto itself, 
characterized in that
 
in parallel relationship with the rectilinear advancing 

path (2, 3) of the sheet to be folded, there is 
provided a resiliently flexible laminae me
ans (6), 
with a resiliently bent outer end (15), at a position 

adjacent to and below the sheet to be folded, said 
laminae means (6) sliding in an own slide assembly 

(3, 16) parallel to said sheet advancing path, said 
laminae means assuming two positions: an operative 

one in which the laminae means (6) is caused to move 
forwards beyond the outlet point (2') of the sheet 

from its advancing path, the end (15) of the laminae 
means (6) at said outlet point (2') of the sheet 

(1) being bent due to its shape memory of bending in 
the same direction in which the sheet leading edge is 

to be initially oriented in order to guide at the 
start the latter towards the folding unit (7, 10,  

 
11), and a second non-operative or rest position in 

which said laminae means (6) is returned to its initial 
retracted position in such a manner that the 

outer portion of the laminae means (6), retracted into 
its slide housing (3, 16), does not hinder the movements 

of the sheet (1) in the folding phases, the 
forward and backward movement of said laminae means 

(6) being caused by a rocker lever member (17) actuated 
at the initial phase of insertion of a new sheet. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the laminae means is made of a material suitable 

for being shaped with shape memory, at one end 
of which laminae, a bent shape was imparted which is 

permanently maintained. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said laminae means, at the end opposite to 

the bent end (15), is connected with a cross-arm (14) 
on which a rocker lever member (17) acts to move the 

laminae means (6) to the retracted position and to 
the projecting position towards the sheet folding 

unit (7, 10, 11). 
A device according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the rocker lever member (17) for the forward 

and backward movement of said laminae means consists 
of a T-shaped rigid piece, the vertical rod (18) of  

 
which, corresponding to the stem, is articulated on 

the cross arm (14) of the set of laminae, while the 
center (20) of the cross rod (19) of the T piece is 

pivoted on the relevant fixed structure of the folding 
machine in a first class lever fulcrum-like manner, 

one end of the cross rod (19) of the rocker lever 
(17), closest to the folding unit, being connected 

to a traction element (21) exerting a traction 
force on said one end, while the other end of said 

cross rod (19) is connected to a return member (22). 
A device according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the traction element (21) connected to one 

end of the cross rod (19) is an electromagnet while 
the return member (22), connected with the other end 

of the cross rod (19), is a spring. 
A device according to claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the laminae means consist preferably of 

several adjacent elements.
