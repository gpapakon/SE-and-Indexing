<ABSTRACT>
The device has greasing rollers with bearings on bearing blocks. Each bearing (18) block is held on baseplates (16,17), via a bearing pin (24). The bearing block is loaded by a spring (23), which supports itself on block and baseplates. The bearing pin permits limited play in several deg. of freedom. Pressure medium cylinders (19,20) and guides (21) are located beside the bearing blocks, and are connected to the baseplates. Each block is held by two bearing pins, which are located symmetrical to the hollow axis (14,15), and at right angles on the baseplates.

A device (10) for the controllable greasing of
workpieces (11) in strip or plate form with a plurality of

hollow greasing rollers (12, 13), which are provided with
grease-permeable material, are aligned coaxial to one

another and are respectively arranged on a hollow axle (14,
15) with both ends on a bearing (18) connected to a base

plate (16, 17) and can be applied via at least two pressure
medium cylinders (19, 20) and two guides (21) to the

workpiece surface (11a, 11b), characterised in that the
bearing (18) at each end (14a, 14b; 15a, 15b) of the hollow

axle (14, 15) is formed by a bearing block (22), which is
held on the respective base plate (16, 17) under the action

of a spring (23) supported against the bearing block (22)
and the base plate (16, 17) via at least one bearing bolt

(24) allowing limited clearance in a plurality of degrees

of freedom of movement, which bearing bolt comprises a
smooth shaft (26), which is enclosed by the through bore

(27) of the bearing block (22) with radial clearance in all
radial directions and so as to be tiltable, and the base

plate (16, 17) is adjustable via the pressure medium
cylinders (19, 20) and the guides (21) in the direction of

the workpiece surface (11a, 11b).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that
each bearing block (22) is held by two bearing bolts (24)

arranged symmetrical to the hollow axle (14, 15) and
perpendicular to the base plate (16, 17).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the bearing bolts (24) are formed by internal

hexagonal screws recessed with their head (25) into the
base plate (16, 17) and having smooth shafts (26), which

are circular in cross section and penetrate the bearing
blocks (22) in circular bores (27) with radial clearance 

and are screwed at their exit point via a threaded end (28)
to a nut (29).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the respective spring (23) is formed

by a cylindrical helical spring, which encloses the smooth
shaft (26) of the bearing bolt (24) with radial clearance

and is fitted with one end (23a) in the base plate (16, 17)
and with its other end (23b) in the bearing block (22) in a

circular recess in each case.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the spring (22) is formed by a

pneumatic spring which is articulatedly connected at one
end to the base plate (16, 17) and at its other end to the

bearing block (22).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the bearing block (22) is formed by a

divided clamping block, between whose parts (22a, 22b) the
end (14a, 14b, 15a, 15b) of the hollow axle (14, 15) is

non-rotatably clamped by means of a screw connection (30).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that one of the base plates (16) of two

greasing rollers (12, 13) receiving the workpiece (11)
which is to be greased or rows of such rollers (12, 13) can

be fixed in place, both base plates (16, 17) are provided
with side walls (31) and the end of a pressure medium

cylinder (19, 20) and a guide (21) is secured to each side
wall (31) of a base plate (16, 17).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the end of a pressure medium cylinder

(19, 20) is arranged in the outer peripheral region (39) of
each side wall (31) and the slideably displaceable end 

(21a, 21b) of a guide (21) is arranged in the geometrical
central region (41) of each side wall (31).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the pressure medium cylinders (19,

20) are articulatedly connected to the side walls (31) at
one end via an L-shaped angle bracket (33) and at the other

end via a bracket (36) having a U-shaped cross section.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the guide (21) is formed by a rod

having a circular cross section, which is guided at both
ends (21a, 21b) in a respective slide bearing (38) of a

side wall (31) of two diametrally opposed base plates (16,
17).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the guides (21) are formed by known

ball guides and the pressure medium cylinders (19, 20) by
pneumatic cylinders.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the pistons of the pneumatic

cylinders (19, 20) can be acted upon from both sides for
application to and lifting from the workpiece surface (11a,

11b).
