<ABSTRACT>
The electronic ignition method and device of the invention ensure, between two periods of charging of the primary (13), the passage of a measurement current in the primary (13) for at least one diagnostic period defined by the computer (16). The rate of increase of current in the primary (13) is determined and discriminated by comparison with a threshold in order to deduce information on the presence and/or quality of a spark to the spark plug (10) connected to the secondary (12) of the ignition coil (11). The primary current is measured at the terminals of a shunt (15), and the measurements transmitted to the comparator-type detector (18) delivering signals about the presence of a spark to the computer (16), which controls the make-and-break switch (14) via an interface amplifier (17). Application to diagnosing ignition of controlled-ignition internal combustion engines.

Electronic ignition process for an internal combustion
engine with controlled ignition, in each engine

cylinder, by means of at least one spark plug (10) in
series with a secondary winding (12) of an ignition

coil (11) whose primary winding (13) is fed with
electric current from a source (Vbat) through a

commutator (14) mounted in a charging circuit of the
primary (13), and itself controlled by a calculator

control unit (16), comprising the stage of controlling
cyclically the charging of the primary (13) during

defined charging periods (t1-t0) and at moments (t0)
defined by the calculator control unit (16) so that

the cutting of the charge at the end (t1) of each
charging period (t1-t0) is intended to cause a spark

at the spark plug (10), characterised in that it also
comprises the following stages:


between two successive charging periods (t1-t0)
and during the period of the spark presumed to

follow the first of the said two successive
charging periods, measuring the passage of a

measuring current in the primary (13) during at
least one diagnosis period (t3-t2) and at at

least one moment (t2) defined by the calculator
control unit (16);
determining a rate of increase of the intensity
(Ip) of the current in the primary (13) during

at least one diagnosis period;
distinguishing a high rate of increase from a
weak rate of increase; and
from this deducing information on the presence
and/or quality of a spark at the spark plug (10) 

at the end of the previous charging period (t1-t0).
Process according to claim 1 characterised in that it
consists in distinguishing the rate of increase of the

intensity (Ip) of the current in the primary (13)
during each diagnosis period (t3-t2) through

comparison with at least one corresponding threshold,
and sending a signal showing the presence of a spark

in the event of exceeding the corresponding threshold.
Process according to claim 2 characterised in that it
comprises furthermore the stage of measuring the

intensity (Ip) of the current in the primary (13)
during at least each diagnosis period (t3-t2) and of

distinguishing the rate of increase by comparing the
maximum intensity measured during the corresponding

diagnosis period with a corresponding threshold of
intensity (Io) in order to issue a signal showing the

presence of a spark if the maximum intensity measured
is higher than the intensity threshold (Io).
Process according to one of claims 2 and 3
characterised in that it consists furthermore in

controlling at least two successive diagnosis periods
(t3-t2, t5-t4) between two successive charging periods

(t1-t0) and in deducing from here on the one hand the
presence of a spark if at least one signal of p
resence
(t3-t'2) is issued in a first predetermined time

interval (T1), following the end (t1) of the previous
charging period, and ending at the earliest at the

same time (t3) as the first diagnosis period (t3-t2),
and on the other hand, a minimum period of a spark of

sufficient quality according to the number of
presence signals issued. 
Process according to claim 4 characterised in that it
consists furthermore in deducing that the spark is too

short if a second presence signal (t5-t'4) is not
issued in a second predetermined time interval (T2),

greater than the first time interval (T1), equally
following the end (t1) of the previous charging

period, and ending at the earliest at the same time
(t5) as the second diagnosis period (t5-t4).
Process according to one of claims 4 and 5
characterised in that it consists in controlling

likewise a third diagnosis period (t7-t6) between two
successive charging periods (t1-t0), and in deducing

from here that the spark plug (10) is short-circuited
if a third presence signal is issued before the end of

a third predetermined time interval (T3), likewise
following the end (t1) of the previous charging

period, greater than the first (T1) and, where
applicable, the second predetermined time interval

(T2), and ending at the earliest at the same time (t7)
as the third diagnosis period (t7-t6).
Process according to any of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that it consists furthermore in

measuring the maximum intensity of the current (Ip) in
the primary (13) during at least one diagnosis period

(t3-t2) of the same order after successive charging
periods (t1-t0), in comparing the measurements among

them and/or at at least one maximum threshold of
intensity (Imax), and in deducing therefrom at least

one signal showing the deterioration of the secondary
circuit comprising the spark plug (10) and secondary

winding (12) of the coil (11). 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that it consists in calibrating each

diagnosis period (t3-t2, t5-t4, t7-t6) on a constant
value and each corresponding threshold (Io) of

intensity of current (Ip) on a value which is
likewise constant.
