<ABSTRACT>
A catheter (11) having a side port (12) for selective 
infusion of fluids is disclosed. The side port (12) may 

be deactivated so that the catheter (11) can be used 
as a non-side port catheter. The side port (12) is rotable 

about the catheter housing (14) to block off access to 
the catheter lumen (32) from the side port (12) when 

the side port (12) is deactivated. The catheter (11) 
is also provided with a valve (40) to facilitate the 

selective infusion of fluid from the side port (12) into 
the catheter lumen (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to catheters in general, and in particular a catheter
introducer assembly of the kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1.Catheters having adapters to facilitate selective infusion of medications and
the like into a patient's body are known in the art. An example of such a device is
the Adsyte® catheter, produced by Becton, Dickinson and Company of Franklin
Lakes, New Jersey. A full description of a catheter adapter having a side port may
be found in US-A-5 098 405.The Adsyte® catheter and that described in US-A-5 098 405
include a housing having a side port. The side port is designed to facilitate the
insertion of a syringe for the selective infusion of fluid. When the syringe is inserted
into the side port and the plunger is depressed, a valve in the catheter housing is
opened and fluid may be infused. When the pressure on the plunger is relaxed, the
valve closes. If the catheter is to remain in the vessel for extended periods, there is
a risk of microbial development since access to the vessel is restricted only by the
valve and a protective cap which may be placed on the side port. US-A-4 311 136 (figures 1-5 and relevant description)
discloses a catheter introducer assembly of the kind defined
supra, which can only be used as a straight catheter. This
prior device is designed to have only one unobstructed fluid
flow passage into the catheter hub at one time. The rotatable
member disclosed in this reference rotates about an axis
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the catheter hub,
and lock means are provided for locking said rotatable member
in the active position whereas no means are provided for
locking said member in the inactive position. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved catheter with a side port to allow
selective infusion of medications and the like. The side port is able to be
deactivated, thereby preventing its further use.It is a further object of this invention to provide a catheter which can function
as a side port catheter as well as a normal, non-side port catheter.The above objects are achieved by a catheter according to Claim 1.The invention is embodied in a medical catheter assembly which has a
housing having a passage extending through it. The passage has an axial lumen
having first and second ends and through which fluid can flow and is provided with
an opening disposed between the first end and the second end. A side port for
providing access to the passage is attached to the housing. The side port is provided
with a cavity for

<CLAIMS>
A medical catheter introducer assembly comprising:

a needle (13);
a catheter assembly comprising a cannula (24) disposed
about the needle (13) and a housing (14) attached to the

cannula (24), the housing (14) having proximal and distal ends
and a longitudinal axis;
a passage (32) extending through the housing (14) from the
proximal end to the distal end;
a side port (12) secured to the housing (14) and rotatable
between an inactive position and an active position for

providing access to the passage (32) via an opening (38) in the
housing (14) such that fluid can be infused through the side

port (12) and into the passage (32);
means for selectively moving the side port from the active
position into the inactive position such that when the side

port (12) is in the inactive position, fluid flow between the
side port (12) and the passage (32) is inhibited; and
a ratchet (50, 52) for locking the side port (12) in one
of said positions;
characterised in that

   said side port (12) is rotatable about the longitudinal
axis of the housing (14) and is adapted to provide, in the

active position, lateral access to the passage (32) via a
radially extending opening (38) in the housing (14); said

ratchet (50, 52) being adapted to lock said side port (12) in
the inactive position.
The assembly of Claim 1 wherein the means (18) for
selectively moving the side port (12) closes the opening (38)

when the side port (12) is in the inactive position.
The assembly of Claim 1 wherein the means for selectively
moving the side port (12) comprises a rotatable sheath (18)

fitting at least partially around the housing (14).
The assembly of Claim 1 further comprising a valve (40)
disposed between the side port (12) and the passage (32) to

selectively inhibit fluid communication through the opening
(38) and into the passage (32).
