<ABSTRACT>
A method for analysing material in a liquid sample, comprises the steps of: distributing the sample equally by passage through a number of discrete wells adapted to retain the material, the concentration of material being such that it is absent in at least one well; and analysing the wells for the presence of retained material. A device adapted for use in a method for analysing material in a liquid sample, comprises the combination of: a container for the sample; a unit comprising a number of discrete wells adapted to retain the material and allow the passage of liquid under the application of reduced pressure; means for drawing liquid from the container and through the wells under reduced pressure; and a manifold or other means that provides uniform distribution of the sample passing from the container into the wells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of analysis, e.g. 
for enumerating and/or identifying microorganisms or other 
biological material in a liquid sample, and to apparatus 
for use in such a method. Many industries, including pharmaceuticals, need to 
detect low levels of materials in large volumes of liquid. 
For example, they rely heavily on classical microbiological 
techniques to detect microbial contamination. Areas often 
under surveillance by Quality Assurance personnel include 
the control of bioburden in incoming raw materials, 
especially liquids; monitoring of microbial population in 
the production environment; in-process controls, especially 
after storage; and final product testing. Often product is 
manufactured and stored whilst analysis for microbial 
content takes place. If contamination is detected, the 
product may need to be destroyed, and the production line 
shut down until the source of contamination is found. 
Often the time taken for microbial analysis is the rate-limiting 
factor in bringing the plant on stream. This can 
lead to substantial costs in wasted production or raw 
materials. The determination of the number of microorganisms 
present in the various types of water used in a 
pharmaceutical environment is considered a critical factor 
in producing many products. Usually, the microbiological 
specification ranges from 0.01 to 100 cfu per ml of water, 
depending on the source of the sample. Classical methods of microbe detection, whilst 
considered reliable and accepted in the industry, are slow 
and require valuable storage and laboratory space. A test for coliform bacilli is described in "Handbook 
of Practical Bacteriology" 9 (1956), by T.J. Mackie and 
J.E. McCartney, pub. E. and S. Livingstone. The method  
 
employs a specific medium which is utilised by coliforms to 
release acid, and thus to give a colour change with a pH 
indicator. Several tubes are set up, at different 
dilutions, and a McCrady table is used to determine the 
most probable number of bacilli, from the number of 
positives detected. This method allows the detection of 
small numbers of microbes in a large volume of liquid, but 
involves serial dilution and an incubation stage of 48 
hours. Cherwell Laboratories Ltd., Bicester, UK, and 
Wilkinson and Simpson Ltd., Gateshead, UK, each produce 
test kits, respectively under the trade names Colitrace and 
Colilert, designed to test water for levels of selected 
organisms down to 1 per 100 ml of sample. The sample is 
distributed between independent

A method for analysing material in a liquid sample, 
which comprises the steps of: 


distributing the sample by passage through a number of 
discrete wells adapted to retain the material, the 

concentration of material being such that it is absent in 
at least one well; and 
analysing the wells for the presence of retained 
material. 
A method according to claim 1, in which the material 
is DNA or RNA. 
A method according to claim 1, in which the material 
comprises microorganisms. 
A method according to any preceding claim, which 
comprises, prior to the analysing step, the additional step 

of introducing into the wells a substance that emits a 
signal in the presence of retained material. 
A method according to claim 4, in which the substance 
comprises bioluminescence reagents. 
A method according to any preceding claim, which 
comprises the additional step of amplifying the retained 

material, or evidence of its presence. 
A method according to claim 6, in which the amplifying 
step comprises introducing a liquid growth medium for the 

material into the wells. 
A method according to any preceding claim, in which 
the analysing step comprises adding one or more probes for 

the material, and analysing the wells for evidence of 
reaction between a probe and the material. 
A method according to any preceding claim, for 
enumerating the material, which comprises calculating the 

number of wells in which material is retained as a function 
of the total number of wells. 
A method according to any preceding claim, in which 
the analysing step comprises identifying the material 

retained in one or more wells.  
 
A method according to any preceding claim, in which 
the wells are provided in an integral member and whose 

bases are defined by filter material. 
A method according to claim 11, in which the sample 
passes through the wells under the application of reduced 

pressure. 
A device adapted for use in a method for analysing 
material in a liquid sample, which comprises the 

combination of: 

a unit (27) comprising a number of discrete wells (28) 
adapted to retain the material and allow the passage of 

liquid under the application of reduced pressure; 
a container (25) for the sample, comprising a 
plurality of chambers (26) each corresponding to a well; 
means for drawing liquid from the container and 
through the wells under reduced pressure; and 
means (31) for holding the container relative to the 
unit, while maintaining a peripheral liquid seal (33), in 

either a first fixed position (Fig. 2) where liquid sample 
can pass between the chambers above the unit or a second 

fixed position (Fig. 3) where each corresponding chamber 
and well define a discrete volume. 
A device according to claim 13, wherein 
each well (42) is divided into two or more compartments 

(42,44) by one or more walls (43) whose height is less than 
that of the well (42).

the bases of the wells are defined by filter material.
