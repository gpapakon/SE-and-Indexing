A compound of formula I


in which

R'
is a naphthalene ring which is bonded in the alpha or beta position and is
optionally derivatized with alkyl groups containing up to 3 carbon atoms

and/or alkoxy groups having up to 3 carbon atoms in each case, or is a tetralin
ring which is bonded in the alpha or beta position and is optionally derivatized

with alkyl groups containing up to 3 carbon atoms and/or alkoxy groups
having up to 3 carbon atoms in each case, or is a phenyl ring which is

optionally derivatized with alkyl groups containing up to 4 carbon atoms
and/or with up to three groups of the structure O-X in which O is oxygen or

sulfur and X is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, or tert-butyl, is a
chroman system which is derivatized preferably with up to 5 alkyl groups

which contain up to 3 carbon atoms
R 1
is a group of the structure A-B-Poly, in which A is -(CH2)n-, n is an integer
from 1 to 7,

B is a bond, -CO-NH-, -N(Y)-CO- with Y= H, CH
3
 or C

; -CO-O-, -O-CO-,
-SO
2
-NH-, -S-S-, -S-, -O- or -N(Y)- with Y = H, CH
3
 or C
2

5
 and

Poly is a polymer from the group of polyethylene glycols and this polymer has
a molecular weight of up to 75000, and 
R2 and R3
can be identical or different and are an alkyl group with up to 4 carbon atoms
or together form a ring and may possibly be derivatized with a hydroxyl

group or a hydroxyalkyl group, where the hydroxyalkyl groups contain up to 3
carbon atoms, and this hydroxyl group is optionally also in esterified form,

where the appropriate acids are carboxylic acids which preferably contain up
to 17 carbon atoms, and their physiologically acceptable salts and
C *
is in the R or S structure, but preferably in the R structure.
A compound as claimed in claim 
1
, where in C * is in the R structure.
A compound as claimed in claim 
1
, in which R' is β-naphthyl, A = -CH
2
-, B = -CO-NH-, and poly
is a polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 750 to 20000, and R2 and R3 together are

piperidine.
A compound as claimed in claim 
1
, in which R' is β-6,7-dimethoxynaphthyl-, A = -CH
2

1
, in which B is -N(Y)-CO- with Y being H, CH
3
 or C
2
H
5
.
A process for the preparation of a compound of formula I, which comprises reacting a compound
of the formula II:



where R' and n have the above meaning, and R4 is a protective group customary in amino acid
chemistry, for example a benzyl group, a tert-butyl group or a methyl group, and R
5
 is a carboxyl
group or an amino group, a hydroxyl group, a SO
3
H group or a sulfhydryl group (-SH), with an
above mentioned polymer from the group of the polyethylene glycols, eliminating the protective

group R4, resulting in a polymer-bound amino acid derivative of the formula II, in which R5 is a
group polymer-B-, R4 is hydrogen and R', n and B have the above mentioned meaning and

bonding this derivative by known coupling methods to the primary amino group of a compound of
the formula III 



and obtaining a compound of the formula I in claim 
1
.
A diagnostic or therapeutic composition containing a compound as claimed in claim 
1
.
The use of a compound as claimed in claim 
1
 for the production of a diagnostic aid or of a
pharmaceutical with antithrombotic effect.
