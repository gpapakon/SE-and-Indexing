<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the basic mixing of rubber, which is arranged upstream of a device for the final mixing, an internal mixer (3) being provided for the mixing of rubber and non-reactive additives. In order to eliminate porocities and troublesome vapours, at least to a great extent, in spite of use of a closed system in the form of the internal mixer, according to the invention there is arranged underneath the internal mixer a weight-less internal mixer (12) which is connected to the first internal mixer in such a way that, for fine distribution of the non-reactive additives, the rubber provided with the non-reactive additives can be transferred from the internal mixer directly into the weight-less internal mixer.

<CLAIMS>
Method of producing rubber mixtures, wherein a 
master batch is produced from rubber and non-reactive 

additional substances in a first stage in a ram-type 
masticator, and then a final mixture is produced in a 

second stage by adding reactive additional substances to 
the master batch, at least the first stage being operated 

chargewisely, characterised in that the master batch, 
produced in the first stage in a ram-type masticator, is 

transferred to a ramless masticator for finely distributing 
the non-reactive additional substances in the rubber and 

finally mixed there, whereupon the master batch is supplied 
to the second stage. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the master batch is cooled in the ramless masticator.
