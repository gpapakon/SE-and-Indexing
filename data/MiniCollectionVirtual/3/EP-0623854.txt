<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus for developing monosheet 
lithographic offset printing plates according to a DTR process, 

wherein the guidance control of a printing plate in a developing 
bath, is characterised by 


1) a pair of entrance rollers 21 that are disposed at the entrance 
of the developing station 12, one above the other and substantially 

parallel under an angle α of at least 5° to the horizontal, and 
2) a pair of exit rollers 22 that are disposed substantially 
parallel, under an angle γ to the horizontal less than 25°, at a 

distance from the pair of entrance rollers 21 so that the printing 
plate is guided through the developing station by any or both of the 

roller pairs 21 or 22, and 
3) a bottom guidance member 19 for supporting the printing plate, 
that has a curvature radius of at least 400 mm, and an exit plane 

inclined upwardly for guiding the printing plate in a well defined 
path in the developing bath 12, such that the leading edge of the 

plate is directed tangentially into the nip of said pair of exit 
rollers 22, defined by an angle β to the horizontal, said angle 

being less than 25° and wherein said bottom guidance member (19) has 
an open mesh structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the processing of 
photographic sheet materials and particularly for developing 
lithographic offset printing plates according to a silver complex 
diffusion transfer reversal process. EP-A-410500 discloses an imaging element containing a support 
provided with an image receiving layer and a silver halide emulsion. 
In said document is disclosed a diffusion transfer reversal process 
(hereinafter called "DTR process") for obtaining a lithographic 
printing plate in which said imaging element (further commonly 
indicated as "printing plate") is imagewise exposed and subsequently 
developed using a developing liquid or activating liquid in the 
presence of a silver halide complexing agent. The printing plate is 
then guided through a diffusion transfer zone so that the silver 
halide complexes formed during the development step are allowed to 
diffuse into the image receiving layer where they are converted to 
silver. When the printing plate leaves the diffusion transfer zone 
a silver image is formed in the image receiving layer. Hereafter, 
the printing plate passes a washing and a rinsing station to remove 
the silver halide emulsion layer so that the silver image is 
exposed. Finally the printing plate, now carrying a silver image on 
its surface, is treated with a finishing liquid that contains a so 
called hydrophobizing agent for improving the hydrophobicity of the 
silver image. In an apparatus or system for the developing of such lithographic 
printing plates it is advantageous to maintain the length of the 
developing path of the printing plate in the processing liquids 
within specified limits so as to achieve high quality printing 
plates. By controlling the length of the developing zone and the 
transportation speed of the printing plate, the time allowed for 
said developing can be controlled. However, experience shows that, 
even if the developing time is under control, some density  
 
differences on the printing plate still may be present. Even if 
besides the developing time, also the developing fluid is under 
control regarding fluidlevel and flowrate and flowdistribution 
within the developing bath, as well as other physical and chemical 
characteristics (as e.g. temperature and photographic activity) a 
prohibitive uneveness in density remains perceptable. At this point, a particular problem is situated in the accurate 
geometrical control of the whole developing path of the plate, 
clearly including the entrance of the plate in the bath and
