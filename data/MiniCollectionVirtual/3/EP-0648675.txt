<ABSTRACT>
A packaging machine for delicate rod-shaped objects, 
especially cigarettes, comprises a feeder (1) that takes a 

succession of ordered groups of cigarettes (S) to a station 
(A) that feeds them to a unit (30) that transfers said 

ordered groups one after the other into a transfer station 
(T), in which each of them is transferred, by pusher means 

(13, 16) and together with a wrapping sheet (F), into an 
empty cigarette carrying socket (118) in a folding drum 

(18). According to the invention, the transfer unit (30) is 
constructed in such a way that the individual groups of 

cigarettes (S) are carried from the feeding station (A) to 
the transfer station (T) following a straight path (X) of 

predetermined length along a stationary conveying surface 
(4) which is in a predetermined position and which has an 

inlet end at the feeding station (A) and an outlet end at 
the transfer station (T).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a packaging machine for
delicate rod-shaped objects, especially cigarettes, of the
type comprising a feeder which takes a succession of not
wrapped groups of ordered cigarettes to a feeding station
that feeds said groups of cigarettes to a transfer unit,
which in turn transfers the groups of cigarettes one after
the other by pusher means and together with a wrapping sheet
into a coinciding empty cigarette carrying socket in a
folding drum that folds said wrapping sheet around the group
of cigarettes, the individual groups of cigarettes being
transferred from the feeding station following a straight
path of predetermined length along a horizontal stationary
movement guide which is oriented radially with respect to
the folding drum and has an inlet end at the feeding station
and an outlet end near the folding drum.A packaging machine of this kind is known from its prior
manufacture by the Applicant.An analogous packaging machine is known from the
document DE-A-2439192, but in this machine wrapped groups of
cigarettes are transferred from a station to another, while
in the initially described packaging machine according to 
the pre-characterizing part of claim 1 the transferred
groups of cigarettes are not wrapped. The handling of not
wrapped groups of cigarettes is different from the handling
of wrapped groups of cigarettes and requires the solution of
different problems.The invention is based on the problem of providing a
packaging machine of the type described at the outset, in
which the transfer unit is constructed in such a way as to
provide a treatment that is more appropriate for the
delicate, not wrapped objects being handled, while assuring
a greater accuracy of synchronization and greater efficiency
of the machine, as well as an easier and direct
accessibility for manual intervention and visual monitoring
of the products being processed and of the operating parts.The invention solves this problem with a packaging
machine according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1
and characterized in that the transfer unit is constructed
in such a way that the individual groups of cigarettes are
carried by a first pusher from the feeding station to a
transfer station provided at the terminal portion of the
stationary conveying surface and then by a second pusher
from the transfer station into the cigarette carrying socket
of the folding drum, by an additional transferring movement
in the direction of a continuation of the straight path. The length of the straight transfer path
