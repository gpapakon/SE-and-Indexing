<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of
making carbon electrodes for use in the steel and
other industries, and particularly to a process for
preparing an impregnating pitch for impregnating
carbon electrodes, said impregnating pitch being
made by the sequential employment of two specific
steps before distillation -- the centrifugation of a
coal tar to remove large particles of quinoline
insoluble materials, and the milling of the
centrifuged coal tar to reduce the sizes of the
remaining quinoline insoluble particles. Contrary
to prevailing assumptions, a coal-tar pitch having
relatively high quinoline insolubles is thus found
to be useful as an impregnating pitch for carbon
electrodes.The commercial carbon industry
manufactures graphite electrodes that are used in
electric-arc steelmaking furnaces. These carbon
artifacts must carry large electric currents in the
steel melting processes. The desirable
characteristics of these carbon electrodes are high
density, high modulus of elasticity, high electrical
conductivily and high flexural strength. Such electrodes are typically made by
mixing petroleum coke with coal-tar pitch having a
high solids content including many particles greater
than 10 microns, known as binder pitch. The mix is
extruded to form a cylinder known as a "green form",
which is baked at 900°-1300°C to volatilize and
remove non-carbonaceous material. When the green
form is baked, it is transformed from a product
which contains about 95% carbon to one which
contains greater than 99% carbon. During the baking
process, some of the organic compounds are
destructively distilled, resulting in carbon
deposition in the form. As the vaporized materials
vacate their specific locations and exit the form,
they produce a porous and channeled structure,
resulting in a reduced density and reduced capacity
of the form for carrying current. Impregnating
pitches are used to fill the pores and channels to
increase the carbon density of the form and thus
improve the current carrying capacities of the
electrode. After impregnation, the form is baked
again and then graphitized at temperatures as high
as 3000°C.In the prior art, impregnation required a
pitch having a low content of solids greater than
about 1 micron in size. Petroleum pitch has been
most frequently used in the past because it is
relatively free of solid particles; if coal-tar
pitch is used, it must have a low solids content to
pass the filterability test. Solids content of
coal-tar pitch is generally expressed in terms of
quinoline insolubles, or
