<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor 
integrated circuit device and, more particularly, to a 
technique effectively for use in a semiconductor 
integrated circuit device such as a collectively 
erasable nonvolatile memory device (flash EEPROM 
(Electrically Erasable And Programmable Read-Only 
Memory)) having internal voltages of a plurality of 
types. The flash EEPROM is a nonvolatile memory 
device having a capability of electrically erasing all 
memory cells or a block of memory cells formed on a chip 
at a time. Such a flash EEPROM is described in "IEEE 
International Solid-State Circuits Conference," pp. 152 
and 153, 1980 and "IEEE International Solid-State 
Circuits Conference," pp. 76 and 77, 1987, and "IEEE, J. 
Solid-State Circuits," Vol. 23, pp. 1157 to 1163, 1988, 
for example. We have developed a memory transistor having a 
control gate and a floating gate in which a program 
operation is also performed by a tunnel current and, 
contrary to a conventional memory transistor, a charge 
is injected into the floating gate to raise a threshold 
voltage over a select level of a word line for an erase 
operation. In this novel constitution, for the erase 
operation for the memory transistor, the threshold 
voltage is higher than the word line select level. 
Therefore, unlike the conventional memory transistor in 
which the charge of the floating gate is pulled out into 
a substrate side to lower the threshold voltage, the 
novel memory transistor protects other memory cells from 
being made unreadable by an excess erasure that puts the 
transistor in the depletion mode, turning on the word 
line although it is at the deselected level. However, for a memory transistor such as the 
novel memory transistor in which a program operation is 
performed by the tunnel current, it is necessary to 
minimize a voltage to be applied to a drain of the 
memory transistor at a read operation, thereby 
preventing an erroneous erasure from being caused by the 
tunnel current generated by the read operation. Thus, 
the memory transistor in which the program operation is 
performed by the tunnel current requires to set an  
 
operating voltage with precision. This in turn requires 
a circuit for forming many types of voltages on a 
semiconductor integrated circuit. EP-A-0350462 provides a semiconductor device wherein the HV 
output voltage of the voltage multiplier comprises a transistor 
T1, functioning as a current generator, whereby the gate-source 
voltage is kept substantially constant independently 
of the
