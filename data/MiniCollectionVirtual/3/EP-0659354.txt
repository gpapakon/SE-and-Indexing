<ABSTRACT>
A method and machine whereby a succession of 
double cigarettes (15), each consisting of two cigarette 

portions (5) connected by a double filter (6), is fed, 
in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of 

the double cigarettes (15), through a cutting unit (17) 
wherein each double cigarette (15) is cut into two 

single cigarettes (20) which are fed through a 
perforating unit (22) before being separated axially, 

and, as they are being perforated, are rotated about 
their axes (71a) by respective rotation devices (68, 

69).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing ventilated cigarettes.So-called "ventilated" cigarettes are produced
using perforating devices normally forming part of a
filter assembly machine, and the perforating "tool" of
which consists of a focused laser beam.On filter assembly machines of the type described,
for example, in British Patent n. 2241866, filter-tipped
cigarettes are produced from a succession of first
tobacco items consisting of double cigarette portions
which, traveling transversely through a first cutting
station along the path defined by the filter assembly
machine, are each cut into two single portions to form a
first and second orderly succession traveling side by
side and parallel to each other. At a rolling station
along the path, each portion in one of the two
successions is connected to a corresponding portion in
the other succession to form a second tobacco item
hereinafter referred to as a "double cigarette". Each
double cigarette consists of two cigarette portions 
separated by a double filter connected integral with the
two portions by a band, the central portion of which
surrounds the double filter, and the end portions of
which each surround the end of a respective cigarette
portion.According to the above British patent, the double
cigarettes so formed are then fed successively through a
second cutting station where they are cut transversely
into half to form two successions of third tobacco items
consisting of oppositely-oriented single cigarettes.
That is, downstream from the cutting station, the single
cigarettes in each pair formed by cutting each double
cigarette are arranged with their filters facing and
substantially contacting each other.According to the above British patent, the two
successions of filter-tipped cigarettes are then fed
along said path to a turnover station where each
cigarette in one succession is turned over and fed into
the gap between two adjacent cigarettes in the other
succession to form a single succession of equioriented
cigarettes.On a filter assembly machine of the above type,
the perforating device mentioned previously is normally
of the type described, for example, in US Patent n.
5,105,833, and is associated with a feed roller
downstream from the turnover station, for forming
ventilation holes through the filter connecting bands of
the cigarettes in said single succession of equioriented 
cigarettes.Though theoretically feasible, forming ventilation
holes in the cigarettes downstream from the turnover
station in actual fact
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of producing ventilated cigarettes
(76), the method comprising the steps of feeding a

succession of groups (4), each consisting of two
cigarette portions (5) connected by a double filter (6),

along a given path (B) and in a direction perpendicular
to the longitudinal axis of the groups (4); making the

two cigarette portions (5) and the double filter (6) in
each group (4) integral with one another by means of a

respective wrap-around band (13) to form a double
cigarette (15); cutting the double cigarettes (15) to

obtain two successions (18, 19; 74, 75) of single
cigarettes (20) presenting filters (21) facing and

contacting each other; turning over one
(75) of the two successions (74, 75) so that the

relative single cigarettes are aligned with and
equioriented in relation to the single cigarettes in the

other succession (74); and forming ventilation holes in
the single cigarettes (20) to obtain ventilated

cigarettes (76); the method being characterized in that
the perforating step is performed immediately after the

double cigarette cutting step and prior to the turnover
step, to simultaneously form said ventilation holes in

the two single cigarettes (20) of each pair of single
cigarettes (20) obtained by cutting a relevant double

cigarette; the cigarettes (20) of each said pair being
aligned with each other, and being arranged with the 

filters (21) facing, and close to, each other.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized
in that the perforating step is performed on pairs of

cigarettes (20) wherein each single cigarette (20) in
each pair is rotated about its axis (71a) independently

of the other single cigarette (20) in the pair.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the perforating step is performed

by means of a laser beam (30) which is divided into two
focused laser beams (40, 42) for simultaneously

perforating the single cigarettes (20) in both
successions (18, 19) of single cigarettes (20).
A machine for producing ventilated cigarettes
(76), the machine comprising transfer means for feeding

a succession of groups (4), each consisting of two
cigarette portions (5) connected by a double filter (6),

in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of
the groups (4) and along a given path (B); rolling means

(14) for making the two cigarette portions (5) and
respective double filter (6) integral with one another

by means of a respective wrap-around band (13) and so
forming a respective double cigarette (15); cutting

means (17) for cutting the double cigarettes (15) and so
forming two successions (18, 19; 74, 75) of single

cigarettes (20) presenting filters (21) facing and

for turning over one (75) of the two successions (74,
75) so that the relative single cigarettes are aligned 

with and equioriented in relation to the single

means (22) for forming ventilation holes in the single
cigarettes (20) to obtain ventilated cigarettes (76);

the machine being characterized in that the perforating
means (22) are located along said path (B), immediately

downstream from the cutting means (17) and upstream from
