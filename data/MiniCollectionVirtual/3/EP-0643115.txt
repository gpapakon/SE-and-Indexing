<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to waterborne adhesives suitable for use on waxy
substrates.The packaging adhesive area has traditionally been dominated by waterborne
adhesives based on polyvinyl acetate homo-, co- or terpolymer dispersions. In
many of these packaging applications, organic or inorganic solvents are added to
enhance the ability of the waterborne adhesive to "wet-out" and penetrate the
substrate, thereby improving adhesion. Halogenated solvents, and particularly
methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane), are most commonly used for these
purposes, however, their potential environmental and health related effects have
resulted in a search for a satisfactory alternative solvent. Recently US patent
5,100,944 disclosed the effectiveness of ethylene glycol diacetate as a
substitute to methyl chloroform to wet out and penetrate substrates. However,
this solvent is not completely effective as a penetrant on waxy substrates.It has now been found that when certain organic solvents, such as lower
alkyl butyrates, d-limonene, and certain
hydrotreated low molecular weight petroleum distillates and normal paraffins, are
used in waterborne packaging and converting adhesives, improved penetration and
wetting out of waxy substrates are obtained yielding adhesive properties
comparable to or better than those achieved with methyl chloroform. Thus, the
present invention is directed to waterborne packaging and converting adhesives
comprising:
A) a mixture containing:
a) a dispersion of a polymer selected from the group consisting
of vinyl acetate and all-acrylic polymers the dispersion being
present in an amount effective to impart adhesive properties required
for use as a packaging or converting adhesives; b)
i) 0 to 20 parts by weight plasticizer;ii) 0 to 10 parts by weight polyvinyl alcohol;iii) 0 to 20 parts by weight tackifier;iv) 0 to 20 parts by weight filler;v) 0 to 20 parts by weight humectant;vi) 0 to 20 parts by weight of mixtures of i-v;vii) 0 to 25 parts by weight thickener;B) 1 to 35 parts by weight of an organic solvent selected from the group
consisting of the C1-C5 alkyl butyrates, d-limonene,
and C5-C20 aliphatic hydrocarbon petroleum distillates and normal
paraffins.Suitable specific solvents are methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, propyl
butyrate, n-butyl butyrate, pentyl butyrate, d-limonene,
and those petroleum distillates and normal paraffins sold by
Exxon Corporation under the Actrel tradename, such as, Actrelâ„¢ 1111L, 1160L,
1171L, 4493L, 3349L, and 3360L. Of the petroleum distillates, the
