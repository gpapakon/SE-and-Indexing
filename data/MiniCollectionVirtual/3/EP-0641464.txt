<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flight control 
systems for rotary wing aircraft and more particularly 
to an integrated fire and flight control system which 
provides aircraft azimuth and pitch control to prevent 
weapons or sensors from reaching constraint limits. The combat uses for helicopter aircraft have 
changed dramatically over the years to include contact 
with opposing forces, including reconnaissance and 
combat aircraft assistance of troops on the front 
line. This type of use subjects helicopters to 
numerous threats, and therefore new helicopter designs 
incorporate offensive weapons, such as Gatling guns 
and rocket launchers. Initially, the primary control of helicopter 
weapons was accomplished by the pilot aiming the 
aircraft at the target prior to firing. Correction 
for misses was accomplished by the pilot adjusting the 
attitude of the aircraft prior to expending additional 
ordnance. As technology developed, tracking and 
sensing systems were used to locate the target and 
determine the aircraft attitude necessary to aim the 
weapon so as to account for outside forces acting on 
the ordnance, e.g., wind, aircraft speed, etc. Such a 
system typically displays a "cross-hair" indicative of 
actual aircraft attitude and a geometric shape 
indicative of the required aircraft attitude to 
provide a high probability of striking the target with 
the weapon. The pilot is required to maneuver the  
 
aircraft so as to place the cross-hair in the firing 
solution defined by the shape prior to firing the 
weapon. The aiming instructions e.g., cross-hair and 
geometric shape, are typically displayed on a control 
panel, a heads-up display, or helmet-mounted display 
which provides the pilot with visual information 
relating to the target position, ownship attitude, 
heading, speed and altitude. Although such aiming systems improved weapons 
delivery accuracy, the pilot is still under a 
significant burden to regulate aircraft heading and 
pitch attitude. It is well-known that a skilled 
helicopter pilot can control aircraft attitude within 
about 1 degree of pitch and yaw. Although this may 
seem very accurate control, a 1 degree variation in 
pitch or yaw will have a significant effect on the 
trajectory of a projectile. One solution to the above mentioned problem of 
weapons delivery accuracy is to provide the aircraft 
weapons systems with articulated mountings, e.g. 
rocket launchers and gatling guns articulated in 
azimuth and/or elevation. The fire control solution 
is then used to
