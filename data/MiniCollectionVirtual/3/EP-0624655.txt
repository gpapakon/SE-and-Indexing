<ABSTRACT>
Treatment of molten metal, esp. steel, with a purifying agent is characterised by the fact that liq. oxygen or a two-phase mixture of liq. and gaseous oxygen is used as the purifying agent. Oxygen is blown via a blow nozzle (1) in to or onto molten metal (3), with the pipe line (4) and/or the nozzle (1) cooled down so that oxygen has a temp. equal to or less than the boiling temp. of oxygen at a given environment temp. Liq. oxygen is cooled by liq. nitrogen or by liq. oxygen in boiling state.
