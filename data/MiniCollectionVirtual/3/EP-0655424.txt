<ABSTRACT>
A method of bonding together two optical surfaces, such as a scintillator 
plate and a plate which is formed by the ends of a bundle of optical fibres. An assembly 

of this kind can be used in an electron microscope in order to convert the electron 
image into an image of visible light which is transported, for example to a detector. It is 

specified that the two surfaces to be bonded must be bonded rigidly to one another 
without an intermediate layer and without a noticeable intermediate space( 
i.e.
 a space 
much smaller than the wavelength of the visible light). In accordance with the 

invention, this is achieved by optically polishing and cleaning the surfaces to be bonded, 
after which they are arranged one against the other without an intermediate material, t
he 
contacting surfaces then being subjected to a thermal treatment at a temperature beyond 

the fusion temperature but below the softening temperature of the material of each of 
the surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of bonding two optical surfaces 
together, comprising the following steps: forming mutually complementary surfaces, 
subjecting the surfaces to be bonded to a polishing treatment, and arranging the surfaces 
to be bonded against one another. The invention also relates to an assembly of optical components 
manufactured by means of the cited method, and to a particle-optical apparatus 
comprising such an assembly. A method of this kind is known from United States Patent Specification 
No. 4,810,318. It is generally known to bond optical surfaces together by means of a 
layer of adhesive, for example for the manufacture of lens systems used in photographic 
cameras. However, there are also applications imposing special requirements as regards 
the bond of the optical surfaces, which requirements cannot be satisfied by the 
customary adhesive bonds. For example, it may occur that an optical system thus 
assembled is to be used in an environment with radiation which is detrimental to the 
intermediate layer, for example X-rays, ultraviolet radiation or particle radiation such as 
electrons in, for example an electron microscope. The customary organic types of 
adhesive cannot be used in these environments. The cited United States Patent Specification (notably Fig. 2 and the 
associated description) describes how the flat surfaces of two glass lens halves are 
bonded together by means of intermediate layers of an anorganic material. A layer of 
indium-tin oxide having a thickness of 0.5 µm is provided on one of the lens halves and 
on this layer there is provided a layer of BaTiO₃ of a thickness of 2 µm, on which there 
is provided a layer of indium-tin oxide again having a thickness of 0.5 µm. The latter 
layer is slightly polished with cerium oxide, and so is the surface of the other lens half 
to be bonded. The lens halves are subsequently arranged against one another by way of 
the optical surfaces, connection being achieved by direct bonding. The stack of  
 
intermediate layers thus formed has an optical-electrical function in the present lens 
system; the polarizing effect of the central layer is controlled by application of an 
electric voltage to the two outer layers. Intermediate layers between the optical surfaces to be bonded are 
undesirable for some applications. In this respect a distinction should be made between 
thick intermediate layers and thin intermediate layers. Thick intermediate layers are 
undesirable for applications where in a first optical medium
