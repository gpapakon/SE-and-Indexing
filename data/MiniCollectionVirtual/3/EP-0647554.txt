<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an axle steering system as can be used on rear axles (1) in particular of lorries, buses, semitrailers or articulated machines in order to facilitate maneouvring the lorries by reducing the turning circle, to reduce the wear of the tyres due to grinding the tyres (2) when maneouvring, and also to allow counter steering for stabilisation purposes during fast driving. It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a rear-axle steering system which operates in a manner which is as simple and low in maintenance as possible and irrespective of the specific dimensions of the lorry requires only a few parts to be matched individually. The intention is also to make retrofitting of a lorry which does not have rear axle steering possible at the lowest possible expense. In order to achieve this object, an actuator (31) which can be adjusted via a control element is required on the axle (1) to be deflected.
