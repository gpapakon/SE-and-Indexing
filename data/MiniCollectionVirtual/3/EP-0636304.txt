<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for powering a gas discharge lamp from a source of a first frequency AC power has a first rectifier (104) for converting the first frequency AC power into a first DC power, a capacitor (108) and driver (110) for converting the DC power to a second frequency AC power. A second rectifier (106) is used to increase the power factor for the circuit. A control (136) is provided to disable the second rectifier if the lamp is removed from the circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
 'HIGH POWER FACTOR GAS LAMP ENERGIZING CIRCUIT"Background of the InventionGas discharge lamps can be operated most efficiently by AC (alternating current) power at a relatively high frequency (on the order 35 KHz [kilohertz]). However, line AC power is supplied by utility companies at low frequencies (around 50 Hz [hertz] or 60 Hz). To obtain high efficiency operation of the lamps, the AC power at the first low frequency is converted to AC power at a second high frequency.The conversion of the AC power from one frequency to another is accomplished by a. ballast circuit. The AC power at the first low frequency is rectified into DC (direct current) power, and then stored as energy in a relatively large electrolytic capacitor. The energy stored in the electrolytic capacitor is then "chopped" by an inverter into AC power at a second high frequency.In this kind of circuit, whenever the voltage of the line AC power is greater than the voltage stored in the electrolytic capacitor, a relatively large surge of current passes into the electrolytic capacitor, causing the line current drawn to be "peaky" and having a poor power factor.One solution is to place a floating voltage supply in series with the incoming line to the capacitor. Such a supply presents several problems. First, the voltage of the supply must be controlled so as to match the voltage on the electrolytic capacitor, otherwise the waveform of the power drawn from the line will be distorted. Second, the impedance level of the supply must be adjustable so as to control the amount of power drawn from the power line. If not, the inverter will either produce too much power or there will be little correction of the power factor. Finally, the source of the power for the floating voltage supply must be stable and have a low impedance. 

 Brief Description of the DrawingsFIG. 1 is a diagram of a circuit for energizing gas discharge lamps.Description of the Preferred EmbodimentFigure 1 shows a circuit suitable for energizing gas discharge lamps.Terminals 100, 102 of line rectifier 104 are coupled to a source of AC power at a relatively low frequency, such as 60 cycles per second.Rectifier 104 may be a bridge rectifier. Line rectifier 104 converts the AC voltage to a DC voltage. The positive output terminal of line rectifier 104 is coupled to a high frequency rectifier 106. (High frequency rectifier 106 could be connected to the negative output terminal of line rectifier 104 with appropriate orientation of the remaining circuit elements.) High frequency
