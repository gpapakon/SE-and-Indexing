<ABSTRACT>
An image processing device and method for identifying an 
input image and a copier including such an image processing 

device and method. The image processing device (1, 2, 3) 
forms a gradated image from the input image, determines 

whether the gradated image includes a specified pattern, 
extracts a portion of the input image corresponding to the 

specified pattern, and compares the extracted portion of 
the input image with a reference pattern to determine a 

degree of resemblance between the extracted portion of the 
input image and the reference pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image processing device and
method and, in particular, to an image processing device and
method for preventing the counterfeiting of bank notes,
negotiable securities, and the like. The invention also
relates to a copier including such an image processing device
and method.The development in recent years of copying devices such
as full-color copiers has enhanced the quality of reproduction
to a level at which one cannot distinguish the copy from the
original with the naked eye. Such faithful reproductions can
now be obtained inexpensively. However, we must consider that
along with this benefit comes the increased risk of copiers
being put to such illicit uses as counterfeiting money,
negotiable securities, and other original documents whose
reproduction is legally prohibited. To avert this danger,
various devices have been developed to prevent copiers from
being used for counterfeiting. One such device is the image
processing device disclosed in EP-A-0382549.That image processing device reads the original image
placed on the glass of the copier by scanning the entire
original four times. It is used in full-color digital copy
machines. Let us assume that a bank note has been loaded into
the copy machine. On the first scan, the device detects the
rough location of the watermark which identifies paper money,
the item which the machine is to be prevented from copying, on 
the assumption that the document on the glass is, in fact, a
bank note. On the second scan, the device detects the exact
position of the bill and the angle at which it is placed,
i.e., the exact position coordinates of the bill on the glass.
On the third scan, the device calculates the position
coordinates of the red seal stamped on the bill from the exact
position of the bill obtained in the second scan. Based on
these position coordinates, it extracts an image from the
region in which the seal is placed, and it makes a judgment as
to whether there is in fact a red seal on this item. By
scanning the item several times, the device is able to detect
whether or not the document loaded in the copier is one which
it would be illegal to copy. If the device detects that a
prohibited document such as a bank note has been loaded to be
copied, it will perform its specified anti-counterfeiting
operations on the fourth scan, such as making the entire
display go black and preventing the copier from operating.In EP-A-0 136 718 there is a method disclosed of identifying a pattern seached after reducing the resolution of the
