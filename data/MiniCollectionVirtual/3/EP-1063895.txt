<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition. In particular, the present invention
relates to a composition for providing a stable suspension of a particulate component.The preparation or supply of materials in a powder form is problematic. The powder
may dust. Dust may be noxious, may have a high or unpleasant odour, settles on
surfaces and may require cleaning therefrom. Furthermore, some powders, for
example enzymes, may cause allergy. Moreover, powders are difficult to meter/dose
in industrial applications, and this difficulty may increase production costs. Powders
are often supplied in bags/sacks which require manual opening. Furthermore,
because of dosing problems, industrial processes using powders must often be
performed in a batchwise manner.Thus, in many applications, for example the production of foodstuffs, it is desirable
to provide a suspension of particulate material, such as functional ingredients, in a
dispersant. The suspension may be used in a manufacturing process or may
constitute an intermediate or a final product for sale to a consumer.EP-A-057205 relates to a liquid bread improver. The bread improver comprises a
vegetable oil having a solid fat content of less than 2.0, a hydrogenated vegetable oil
which is solid at room temperature, a partly hydrogenated vegetable oil which is
solid at room temperature, emulsifiers including at least some diacetyl tartaric esters,
and enzymes. The crystal size of the fat present in the composition is less than 25
µm. In this prior art application, the average particle size of the particles present in
the composition is always less than 50 µm.WO-A-94/08470 relates to a salad dressing. The document discusses the problems of
phase separation of the oil and water phases of the dressing. This prior art document
teaches that a high melting fat which may be added to the oil is thought to form a
fragile agglomerate of fine crystals in which aqueous droplets are captured, so that
phase separation is prevented. US-A-5185173 relates to a pumpable bread improver comprising a dispersion of
solid particles in a liquid glyceride oil, wherein the solid particles include solid fat
particles. The composition comprises greater than 18 wt % solid fat particles. The
solid fat particles have a specific density similar to that of the oil and therefore
should not rapidly settle to form a sediment. The presence of the fat in particulate
form may prevent the sedimentation of the other solid particles.US-A-4889740 relates to a pourable shortening comprising a liquid
