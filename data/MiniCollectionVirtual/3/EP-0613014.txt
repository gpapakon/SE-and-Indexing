<ABSTRACT>
A test probe for use in testing a liquid crystal 
display device includes a rigid carrier block (20) having 

a lower surface to which is secured a flexible circuit (44) 
having a free end (50) aligned with the free end (26) of 

the carrier block. A plurality of projecting probe contact 
features (54) are integrally formed on traces (56) of the 

flexible circuit (44) and project from the plane of the 
flexible circuit adjacent the free end. An elastomeric 

back-up pad (40) is interposed between the carrier block 
(20) and the projecting contact features (54). The lower 

side of the carrier block is recessed (30) and the flexible 
circuit is pre-formed to the configuration of the recess in 

which it is mechanically secured by a rigid clamp or 
pressure bar (60). Conductive traces (56) of the flexible 

circuit have inner ends (58) bearing electrical contacts 
(68) for connection to test circuitry. The rigid carrier 

block (20) is mounted to enable the projecting probe 
contact features to be pressed against a line of contacts 

(16) on a display device panel (12) while maintaining a 
clearance between the aligned free ends of the carrier 

block (26), elastomer (42) and flexible circuit (50) and 
the edge (70) of a member (18) that overlies the display 

panel (12) and extends closely adjacent to and parallel to 
the row of display panel contacts (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the testing of liquid 
crystal displays and more particularly concerns improved 
methods and apparatus using flexible circuits with bumps 
for testing purposes. Liquid crystal display devices are being produced in 
ever increasing numbers, particularly as popularity of the 
portable lap-top type computer is rapidly growing. The 
screen of many lap-top computers is a flat liquid crystal 
display device formed by a device panel having as many as 
two to five thousand electrically conductive circuit lines 
extending to the edges of its four sides for connection to 
input/output display circuitry. A thin flat member 
overlies the panel and the circuit lines and has outer 
edges that run parallel to the rows of contacts formed by 
the ends of the conductive circuit lines. The edges of the 
overlying thin flat member are positioned closely adjacent 
the ends of the display device contacts that are defined by 
the ends of the lines. As with all electronic device system components, it is 
desirable to test operability of the liquid crystal display  
 
devices before assembly of the computer and before assembly 
of the display device with its input/output circuitry. 
Conventional testing employs test cards provided with a 
number of small blades or needles often formed of a 
resilient or spring-like tungsten. The blades or needles 
are mechanically and electrically connected to a test 
circuit board and act as contacts with the display device 
to be tested. The needles are mounted with configuration 
and spacing to enable each needle to individually contact 
one and only one circuit line of the device under test. 
Electrical leads extend from the contacts to the outer edge 
of the board for connecting the probe card to test 
circuitry. In use the test board with its needles is moved 
into engagement with ends of lines on the liquid crystal 
display device. For proper positioning the individual 
blades or needles must be individually adjusted. This 
adjustment is accomplished by bending the resilient needles 
to produce a pattern and spacing to match the existing 
pattern and spacing of the lead ends of the display device 
which is to be tested. Ends of the needles and blades must all fall in the 
same plane in order to assure that each one makes 
electrical contact with a conductive trace on the device 
under test. This is accomplished by bending the blades 
after they are mounted on the probe card, which is 
laborious, time consuming and expensive. Even after such 
adjustment
