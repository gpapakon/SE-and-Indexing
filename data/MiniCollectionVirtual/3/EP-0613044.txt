<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic material comprises a support 
and a light-sensitive layer provided thereon. The 

light-sensitive layer contains silver halide grains dispersed 
in gelatin. A hexa-coordinated cyano-complex is 

doped in the silver halide grains. The amount of the complex 
is in the range of 1×10⁻⁷ to 5×10⁻³ mole based on 1 

mole of silver halide. A localized phase of the complex is 
present on the surface of the grains. According to the 

present invention, the silver halide grains are doped in 
the presence of a compound having a function of inhibiting 

a reaction of the cyano-complex with gelatin, or the 
compound having the function is added to the grains after 

the grains are doped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic
material containing silver halide grains doped
with a hexa-coordinated cyano-complex.In preparation of a silver halide emulsion, a dopant
(i.e., substances other than silver and halogen ion) is
sometimes introduced into silver halide crystals, which has
been well known as a doping technique. The doping technique
of a transition metal has particularly been studied
to improve a silver halide emulsion. For example, a transition
metal compound of VIII group having a cyan ligand
has sometimes been added to a silver halide emulsion in
formation of silver halide grains to improve the sensitivity
of the emulsion.Japanese Patent Publication No. 48(1973)-35373 discloses
a process of forming silver halide grains in the
presence of a water-soluble iron compound, which is used in
an amount of 10-7 to 10-3 mole based on 1 mole of silver.
The publication describes that an emulsion of hard gradation
can be prepared according to the process without degrading
the sensitivity.Japanese Patent Publication No. 49(1974)-14265 discloses
an emulsion containing silver halide grains having a
particle size of not larger than 0.9 µm. A metal compound
of group VIII in an amount of 10-6 to 10-3 mole based on 1
mole of silver is added to the emulsion in formation of the 
grains, and the emulsion was spectrally sensitized with a
merocyanine dye.According to the process of the above-mentioned publications,
an emulsion of high sensitivity can be obtained.
However, a relative increase of the surface sensitivity is
small, since the internal sensitivity as well as the surface
sensitivity is increased in the obtained silver halide
grains.Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 1(1989)-121844
discloses a high sensitive silver halide emulsion
containing silver halide grains that have at least two
parts. The halogen compositions of the two parts are different
from each other. The part that has the smallest
band gap energy contains divalent iron ion. The effect of
this technique is limited to the emulsion containing divalent
iron ion. The publication is silent with respect to
the ligand of the ion.A transition metal compound can be added to the silver
halide emulsion at the stage of grain formation. The compound
may also be added to the emulsion after precipitation
of silver halide grains. However, there is a considerable
difference in a photographic effect between the former and
latter additions. In the former addition, the transition
metal of the compound is introduced into the
