<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of producing powder-form moulding compounds for the injection-moulding of ceramic materials, the compounds being mixed, before injection-moulding, with a binder which is liberated after injection-moulding. The invention calls for a preliminary stage to be introduced involving a heat treatment or a pressure treatment or both and in which water of crystallization contained in the crystal lattice is driven off. This makes it possible to use ceramic materials in injection-moulding processes. This is of particular advantage in the use of such compounds in porcelain manufacture, i.e. in firing such mouldings to produce porcelain.

Method of producing a pulverulent injection moulding compound for the 
production of porcelain, the ceramic base material of which is mixed with a 

binding means which can be removed after the moulding process, characterised 
in that the base compound containing stratified silicates is subjected to a heat 

treatment before the mixing process with the binding means for the conversion 
of the stratified silicates into minerals which are constructed in a non-stratified 

form. 
Method of producing a pulverulent injection moulding compound for the 

production of porcelain, the ceramic base material of which is mixed with a 
binding means which can be removed after the moulding process, characterised 

in that pulverulent materials constructed in a non-stratified form are used as the 
ceramic base material, no materials containing fluorine being contained in the 

base material. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that, before the mixing 
process, the compound is subjected to a heat treatment where an overpressure 

is simultaneously applied. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the compound contains 
ground, baked porcelain. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the compound contains 
ground, glost fired porcelain. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that at least two compounds 
are coloured differently and mixed before the injection moulding process. 
Use of the injection moulding compound, produced in accordance with one of 
the preceding claims, for the production of container parts which are assembled 

after the moulding process. 
Use of the injection moulding compound, produced in accordance with one of 
the claims 1 to 6, for the direct production of containers with at least one 

handle.
