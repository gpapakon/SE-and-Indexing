<ABSTRACT>
A SAW resonator disposed with an IDT electrode and 
reflector electrodes is formed on the surface of a piezoelectric 

substrate (11). Three pieces of the SAW resonator form an acoustic 
coupling by being disposed close to each other, electrode fingers 

comprising the IDT electrode (13a) in the center are all grounded, 
and IDT electrode fingers are electrically independent on the 

side to be connected to input-output terminals of the IDT 
electrodes (12a, 14a) disposed outside. As a result, three 

excitation modes having different propagation frequencies are 
generated which are used to atta
in a broad band SAW resonator 
filter. When these three pairs of the IDT electrode are 

electrically independent, a balanced input-output can be 
achieved, and excellent out-of-band rejection characteristics can 

be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface acoustic wave filter
used for a high frequency circuit of a radio.A conventional surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter has
been used extensively for communication equipment as a RF- and IF-stage
filter within the reception and transmission circuits.
Along with the recent development of mobile communication towards
becoming digitalized, a digital mobile telephone or a digital
cordless telephone has been intensively developed. In the
communication system of these devices, a phase as well as an
amplitude convey information, so that it is essential for a
filter used for an IF-stage that the filter not only has
excellent amplitude characteristics but also is flat in group
delay deviation characteristics. Furthermore, this filter is
required to have excellent selectivity characteristics for
distinguishing a signal of a neighboring channel from a desired
signal, for which steep out-of-band rejection characteristics are
needed. In addition, along with the recent miniaturization of a
set to attain higher mounting density, coupling or interference
between components caused by lack in grounding strength and in
screening has become a problem. Therefore, a balanced type
circuit for controlling these influences has been rapidly
developed. Well-known conventional SAW filters which can be used for
the IF-stage are a transversal type SAW filter and two types of
SAW resonator filters which are a longitudinally coupled
resonator filter and a transversely coupled resonator filter.
The transversal type SAW filter has excellent group delay
deviation characteristics. However, the insertion loss and the
size are big, and in addtion, the out-of-band rejection is poor.
On the other hand, the SAW resonator filters have excellent out-of-band
rejection characteristics and are small in insertion loss
and size, but the group delay deviation characteristics are
inferior to that of the transversal type SAW filter. In
addition, the longitudinally coupled resonator type is
characterized by the large spurious present on the close and high
side of a pass band, while the transversely coupled resonator
type is characterized by having extremely narrow-band pass
characteristics. As a conventional IF filter of mobile
communication, the transversely coupled resonator type SAW filter
was used commonly which had a compactsize and excellent out-of-band
rejection characteristics.A conventional transversely coupled resonator type SAW
filter
as described in US-A-4 542 356
will be explained with reference to FIG.
