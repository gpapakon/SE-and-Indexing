<ABSTRACT>
A post-surgical cardioverting system applies 
cardioverting electrical energy to the atria of the heart 

of a post-surgical heart patient. The system includes a 
first lead (34) including a first elongated electrode (42) 

having a proximal end (46) and a distal end (44), a second 
lead (36) including a second elongated electrode (48) 

having a proximal end (52) and a distal end (50), and 
sutures (53, 55) for releasably anchoring the distal ends 

of the first and second electrodes to the pericardium and 
disposing the first and second electrodes along the 

pericardium overlying the right and left atria 
respectively. A non-implantable cardiovertor (32) is 

coupled to the first and second leads for applying the 
cardioverting electrical energy to the first and second 

electrodes. When cardioversion is no longer required, the 
first and second leads may be pulled out of the patient's 

chest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a
cardioverting system and method for providing temporary
cardioversion of the heart of a heart surgery patient
following a heart surgery procedure. The present
invention is more particularly directed to such a system
for providing post-surgery cardioversion of the
atria of the heart.There are approximately four hundred thousand
(400,000) heart surgery procedures performed annually in
the United States. The types of such surgical procedures
vary from coronary artery bypass grafts to valve
replacements, to repair of congenital heart defects. In
order to gain access to the heart, these surgeries require
the chest to be opened in the middle of the sternum. An
incision is then made in the pericardial sac (pericardium)
to expose the heart and permit the required surgical
procedure to be performed. Following the surgical
procedure, the pericardial incision is reapproximated
(closed except for a drain opening) with sutures and the
chest cavity is closed.Often, following such heart surgical procedures, the
patients' hearts during recovery experience bradycardia or
slow heart rates. In the prior art, to overcome such
maladies, the hearts of post-surgical heart patients are
temporarily paced for a few days following surgery, when
required, to maintain the heart rates at a normal rate.
This is accomplished by releasably attaching heart wires
to the heart before the pericardium is sutured and the
chest cavity is closed. First and second heart wires are
attached to the myocardium of one of the ventricles such
as the left ventricle. The heart wires are then brought
outside of the chest. Thereafter, the pericardium is
sutured and the chest cavity is closed. The proximal ends 
of the heart wires are then coupled to a temporary
pacemaker to permit the heart to be paced. After the
patient has recovered sufficiently wherein pacing is no
longer required, the heart wires are pulled out of the
patient.Unfortunately, twenty to thirty percent of all heart
surgical patients experience an arrhythmia called atrial
fibrillation during the immediate or early post-surgical
period. When this occurs, the heart beats rapidly and
irregularly. According to reports, this constitutes a
major clinical problem resulting in hypotension, heart
failure, pneumonia and/or stroke, due to thromboembolism.
Hence, such a condition is of great concern to the
physician and it is therefore in the best interest of the
patient to terminate this arrhythmia as soon as possible.The development of post-surgical

<CLAIMS>
A post-surgical cardioverting system for applying
cardioverting electrical energy to the heart of a post-surgical

heart patient, including:

a first lead (34) including a first elongated electrode
(42), the first electrode having a proximal end (46) and a distal

end (44),
a second lead (36) including a second elongated
electrode (48), the second electrode having a proximal end (52)

and a distal end (50),
a first anchor (53, 55) for releasably anchoring the distal ends (44, 50) of the first and
second electrodes to body tissue external to but in close

proximity to the heart beneath the skin of the patient to dispose
the first and second electrodes (42, 48) in electrical contact

with the heart, and
a non-implantable cardioverter (32) coupled to the first and second
leads (34, 36) for applying the cardioverting electrical energy

to the first and second electrodes (42, 48).
The system of claim 1 further 
characterized in
that
 the first anchor includes a suture for releasably
suturing the distal ends of the first and second

electrodes to the body tissue external to but in close
proximity to the heart.
The system of claim 1 further 
characterized by
 a
second anchor (54, 56) for releasably anchoring the

proximal ends of the first and second electrodes to body
tissue external to but in close proximity to the heart

beneath the skin of the patient.
The system of claim 3 further 
characterized in
that
 the second anchor includes a suture for releasably
suturing the proximal ends of the first and second 

electrodes to the body tissue external to but in close
proximity to the heart.
The system of claim 1 further 
characterized by
 a
sensor (60) for sensing R waves of the heart, and the

cardiovertor being coupled to the sensor and responsive to
R waves sensed by the sensor for applying the

cardioverting electrical energy to the first and second
electrodes in timed relation to a sensed R wave.
The system of claim 5 further 
characterized in
that
 the cardiovertor is further responsive to the sensed
R waves for applying the cardioverting electrical energy

to the first and second electrodes when the time between
immediately successive R waves is greater than a

preselected minimum time interval.

third and fourth electrodes (38a, 40a) for attachment to a

ventricle of the heart.
The system of claim 7 further 
characterized in
that
 the cardiovertor further includes a pacer (86)

electrodes.
The system of claim 1 further

dimension for extending substantially across a width

dimension of the :right and left atria respectively.
