<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions, or mixtures, of fluorinated
hydrocarbons and more specifically to azeotropic or azeotrope-like compositions
comprising effective amounts of 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-octofluorobutane;
trans-1,2-dichloroethylene or cis-1,2-dichloroethylene;
and methanol,
which form an azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition. Such
compositions are useful as cleaning agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and
polyurethanes, refrigerants, aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous
dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, power cycle working fluids, polymerization
media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, and
displacement drying agents.Fluorinated hydrocarbons have many uses, one of which is as a
cleaning agent or solvent to clean, for example, electronic circuit boards. Electronic
components are soldered to circuit boards by coating the entire circuit side of the
board with flux and thereafter passing the flux-coated board over preheaters and
through molten solder. The flux cleans the conductive metal parts and promotes
solder fusion, but leave residues on the circuit boards that must be removed with a
cleaning agent.Preferably, cleaning agents should have a low boiling point,
nonflammability, low toxicity, and high solvency power so that flux and flux-residues
can be removed without damaging the substrate being cleaned. Further, it is
desirable that cleaning agents that include a fluorinated hydrocarbon be azeotropic
or azeotrope-like so that they do not tend to fractionate upon boiling or
evaporation. If the cleaning agent were not azeotropic or azeotrope-like, the more
volatile components of the cleaning agent would preferentially evaporate, and the
cleaning agent could become flammable or could have less-desirable solvency
properties, such as lower rosin flux solvency and lower inertness toward the
electrical components being cleaned. The azeotropic property is also desirable in 
vapor degreasing operations because the cleaning agent is generally redistilled and
reused for final rinse cleaning.Fluorinated hydrocarbons may also be used as refrigerants. In
refrigeration applications, a refrigerant is often lost during operation through leaks
in shaft seals, hose connections, solder joints, and broken lines. In addition, the
refrigerant may be released to the atmosphere during maintenance procedures on
refrigeration equipment. Accordingly, it is desirable to use a single fluorinated
hydrocarbon or an azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition that
