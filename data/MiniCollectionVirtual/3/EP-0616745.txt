<DESCRIPTION>
 TIMING AND AUTOMATIC FREQUENCY CONTROL OF DIGITAL RECEIVER USING THE CYCLIC PROPERTIES OF A NON-LINEAR OPERATIONFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to radio receivers, and particularly to a receiver which automatically corrects the frequency of a local reference oscillator and the timing of a sampling circuit used to sample an incoming digital modulated signal.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCommunication through the use of modulated digital signals continues to find new and wider application. For example, explosive growth in the use of mobile radio telephones has lead to the adoption of time division multiple access (TDMA) cellular signalling standards, which allow several users to share one radio frequency carrier signal. A transmitted TDMA cellular signal typically consists of an audio signal which has been converted to discrete-time, or digital, symbols. The digital symbols are compressed in time and then typically phase- or amplitude-encoded by quarternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) . The encoded digital signal is then radio-frequency modulated and is often transmitted in bursts during time slots which have been pre- allocated to each transmitter.Carrier frequency recovery and symbol timing synchronization and are two of the most critical functions performed by any digital signal receiver. In order to properly demodulate any incoming radio frequency signal, the phase and 

 frequency of the carrier signal must be accurately tracked by a local oscillator. In addition, if the incoming signal is digitally modulated, a sampling clock in the receiver should be adjusted continuously in order to maximize the probability of correctly detecting the digital symbols. Accurate recovery of symbol timing information can be particularly difficult in certain applications, such as TDMA cellular, where the radio frequency signal has been subjected to sharp roll-off filtering in order to minimize spectral overlap in adjacent frequency bands.Most present-day receivers use continuous-time methods for carrier recovery and symbol synchronization. For example, carrier frequency information is typically recovered through the use of a phase-locked loop, and symbol timing information is derived by band-pass filtering the demodulated signal, or other analog techniques.Certain discrete-time correction techniques have recently been proposed by others. See, for example, U.S. Patent 4,977,580 issued to McNichol, and assigned to Northern Telecom Limited. The technique shown in

CLAIMS
1. A method for correcting the symbol sampling time and carrier frequency error in a received modulated digital signal, comprising the steps of: demodulating the modulated digital signal, by mixing it with a local reference oscillator to provide a baseband signal; sampling the baseband signal to provide discrete-time, in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components thereof; performing a first non-linear operation on the I and Q components, to produce a first composite signal having a first phase component related to a symbol timing error and a second phase component related to a carrier frequency error; performing a second non-linear operation on the I and Q components, to produce a second composite signal having a first phase component related to the symbol timing error and a second phase component related to the negative of the carrier frequency error; detecting the symbol timing error by comparing the first and second composite signals; detecting the carrier frequency error by comparing the first and second composite signals; adjusting the time of subsequent sampling steps according to the detected symbol timing error; and adjusting the frequency of the local oscillator according to the detected carrier frequency error.
