<ABSTRACT>
A device is disclosed for storing objects (14) in a storage block (10) having identical storage places (12) arranged behind, next  to or above each other in the X, Y and Z directions and at least one lifting member (20) associated to the storage block (10). Each storage place is equipped with a driving unit (34) for moving the objects (14) in the Y direction. Further driving units (34') are provided for moving the objects in the X direction between the entrance area (E) and the transfer side (A) of the storage block (10). All successive rows in the X direction have at least one free storage place (12) and one plane of the storage block (10) is designed as a storage and return plane for empty pallets.

Device comprising a storage block (10) for storing objects
and comprising identical storage places (12) arranged behind one

another in the X direction between an entry area (E) and an exit
side (A), next to one another in the Y direction, which is

orthogonal to the X direction, and in the Z direction above one
another, each storage place (12) being equipped with a driving

unit (34') for displacing the objects in the Y direction and
driving units (34) being provided for displacing the objects in

the X direction, wherein one level of the storage block (10) is
designed as a storage and return level for empty pallets and

wherein at least one elevating member (20) is provided,
characterized in that each of the rows following one another in

the X direction of the lines has at least one free storage place
(12) and that in every second line an elevating member (20) is

provided on at least one side of the storing block (10), wherein
each storage place (12) has a displacing module (32) with at

least one driving unit (34; 134) for displacing a bearer plate
(36) resting on the displacing module (32) or an object (14)

designed as a container in the X or in the Y direction.
Device according to claim 1, wherein the storage places (12)
for receiving a bearer plate (36) or an object (14) designed as

a container have a bottom frame (26; 126) which can be displaced
in giude rails (112) in the Y direction by means of running

rollers, wherein the driving units (134) for displacing the
objects (14) in the X direction have a bearing frame (116) which

can be moved in the X direction by means of running rollers
(122) in running rails (110) and which bears on its underside at

least two vertically adjustable cross members (124) with
gripping elements (132) for seizing the objects (14) from above.
Device according to claim 2, wherein the bearing frame (116)
bears in the region of its short outer sides two cross members 

(124) and in the central region at least two further cross
members (124) .
Device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the bearing frame
(116) is equipped with a weighing device, which can be connected

to a central control.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the
elevating member (120) has a frame (152) which can be moved

vertically in a shaft (142), has two mutually parallel running
rails (110') and is intended for receiving a bearing frame

(116).
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein at
least one running-around track (92, 96), connected to the

storage block (10), is provided outside the storage block (10)
for the transport of the objects (14).
Device according to claim 6, wherein a turning platform (104)
for the objects (14) is integrated in at least one running-around

track (92).
Device according to claim 6 or 7, wherein at least one
running-around track (92, 96) is connected to a buffer level

(88) and/or a buffer track (94) for the objects (14).
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein to
the elevating members (20) combined on at least one outer side

(18) of the storage block (10) a displacing track (102) for the
objects (14) is assigned.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the
lowermost level of the storage block (10) serves as a passage

for trucks. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein a
registering device for detecting the data of the delivered

objects (14) is arranged in the entry area (E), the acquired
data being stored in a computer and processed for relocating and

surrendering the object (14).
Process for using the device according to any of the
preceding claims, characterized by the fact that at least in the

fully charged condition of the storage block (10) in each of the
rows following one another in the X direction one storage place

(12) remains free such that in order to withdraw one object (14)
in the X direction, the objects standing in front of it are

shifted exclusively in the Y direction onto the free storage
places existing there, in such a way that a free aisle (16) is

formed in the direction of the lines (X direction), wherein in
every second line an elevating member (20) is provided for the

vertical transport of the objects (14).
