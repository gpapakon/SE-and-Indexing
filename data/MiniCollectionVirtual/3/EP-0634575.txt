<ABSTRACT>
In at least one nozzle, the calibrated hole 
(1532) is formed in a component made of hard material 

(1530) which is inserted in the wall (11) of the distributor, 
at the position of a passage (1534) formed in 

the wall; complementary spherical surfaces, which permit 
variation of orientation, may be provided for mutual 

contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ionization chamber including means for generating electrical or magnetic fields for ionization and a gas distribution device including at least one nozzle with a calibrated hole for the discharge of said gas into said ionization chamber.Devices which use ionization chambers in which,
by the application of a suitable electrical field and
possibly a magnetic field, the ionization of a gas is
achieved, are known and used in various technological
applications; for example, in surface treatments there
are various devices which, by the ionization of one or
more gases, can be used for processes such as the deposition
of thin films on targets placed in front of the
device ("deposition"), or the selective erosion of
certain layers of the target ("etching"), and other
purposes.These ion sources, if suitably configured, may
also be used in the space field for various applications,
primarily electrical propulsion. In this last case, the
device is normally known as an electrical thruster, and
in summary consists of a chamber made of any of various
materials, generally cylindrical in shape, into which the
propellant (gas) is introduced through a suitable gas
distributor, and in which the propellant is ionized;
suitable electrically conditioned means designed to
create a discharge in the gas; and further means capable
of accelerating the ionized gas towards the outside. This
device is used to generate the plasma which is
accelerated towards the outside and is thus capable of
producing a thrust. An example of ion thruster is disclosed in EP-A-0535304.The invention relates to an innovative technological
solution for the distribution of the gas within
ionization devices, such as those illustrated above as
non-restrictive examples.Generally, the propellant enters the discharge
chambers of user devices through a flow line which
carries the gas from a reservoir or container (for 
example, a cylinder) of the gas, which is generally
pressurized, to the ionization chamber, various devices
capable of controlling the flow, such as pressure
limiters, line opening and closing valves, flow controllers,
and others, being normally disposed on the said
line. The gas is then introduced into the ionization
chamber through a suitable distributor whose shape and
materials may vary. These distributors may be single
nozzles with a single hole, as indicated (Fig. 1) by 1,
from which the gas emerges inside the discharge chamber
3, or multiple nozzles 5, with a plurality of outlet
holes 5A (Fig. 2) opening into the
