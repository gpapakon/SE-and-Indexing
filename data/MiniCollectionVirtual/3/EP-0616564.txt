<ABSTRACT>
A method for dry micro-cleaning by spraying abrasive powders having a very small particle size (0-200 micrometres). The method comprises spraying a support to be blasted with a micro-abrasive spray produced by the continuous high-speed movement of a multiplicity of thin compressed air streams which are loaded with low-kinetic energy abrasive particles, and moving the resulting micro-abrasive spray along the whole length of the support to be blasted. The micro-abrasive spray is formed through a spraying wheel (10) provided with multiple fine abrasive spray nozzles (6), whereby close blasting with light surface contact may be achieved, and ashlar supports and the like may be cleaned of all kinds of dirt and deposits.

A method of micro-cleaning and of micro-blasting a 
medium, in which method jets of compressed air charged with 

fine abrasive particles having grain sizes of less than 200 
micrometers are sprayed towards the medium, the jets being 

emitted via nozzles (6) and being displaced at high speeds so 
that they sweep the support, said method being characterized 

in that a multitude of jets are used, the number of jets 
being at least ten, and in that, at each nozzle (6), 

respective jet has a cross-section lying in the range 400 
micrometers to 4 millimeters, thereby imparting very low 

kinetic energy to the jet. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the grain size of the abrasive particles lies mainly in 

the range 80 micrometers to 120 micrometers. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, in which the 
multitude of jets is obtained by dividing up a single jet (2). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that a mist of atomized water 

particles or of fine jets of steam is sprayed 
simultaneously. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that compressed air is sprayed 

without any abrasive, and the spraying pressure of the 
compressed air is used to suck in fine abrasive particles 

just before they are sprayed onto the medium. 
Micro-cleaning and micro-blasting apparatus provided with 
a spraying device (21) including a rotary wheel (10) 

provided with nozzles (6) for spraying compressed air 
charged with fine abrasive particles, said apparatus being 

characterized in that said rotary wheel (10) is provided 
with a multitude of nozzles (6), the number of nozzles being  

 
at least ten, and each nozzle having an inlet cone (7) and a 

through section lying in the range 400 micrometers to 4 
millimeters through which the particles can pass. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized by the fact 
that the wheel (10) is provided with in the range about ten 

to several tens of nozzles (6). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized by the fact 
that the wheel (10) is provided with in the range several 

tens of to several hundred nozzles (6). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized by the fact that said device (21) further 

includes means for pivoting it relative to a fixing support. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 9, 

characterized by the fact that the through section for the 
particles in the nozzles lies in the range 1 millimeter to 

2.5 millimeters. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterized by the fact that said nozzles (6) are disposed 

at different multidirectional spraying angles. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 11, 
characterized by the fact that the spraying device (21) is 

also provided with nozzles (14) for spraying a mixture of 
compressed air and of water. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 11, 
characterized by the fact that the spraying device (21) is 

also provided with nozzles (17) for spraying fine jets of 
steam. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 13, 
characterized by the fact that said nozzles (6, 14, 17) do  

 
not project from or hardly project from the spraying face 

(15) of the wheel (10). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 14, 
characterized by the fact that, in the direction in which 

the abrasive particles are displaced, the device (21) 
includes a feed tube (2) for feeding in the air-abrasive 

mixture, the tube opening out into a funnel-shaped flared 
portion (4) 
Apparatus according to claim 15, characterized by the 
fact that said flared portion (4) communicates with said 

nozzles (6), each of said nozzles forming an acute angle 
with the longitudinal axis of said feed tube (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 15 or 16, characterized by 
the fact that an independent pipe (19) via which the 

abrasive is sucked passes through the feed tube (2) and the 
flared portion (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 16 or 17, characterized by 
the fact that the air/particle mixture is fed to said flared 

portion (4) via a fixed tube (1) and via a rotary pipe (2) 
that is secured to said wheel (10), sealing between the 

fixed portion and the moving portion being provided by a 
recessed joint (26) via which the fixed portion is received 

in the moving portion, with rotary gaskets (5) of the lip 
seal type being provided.
