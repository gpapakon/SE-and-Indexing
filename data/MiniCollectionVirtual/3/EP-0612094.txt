<ABSTRACT>
A color cathode-ray tube includes a curved shadow 
mask (25) formed having a number of apertures and a 

substantially rectangular effective surface facing the 
inner surface of a panel (22). The effective surface of 

the shadow mask has a center through which the tube axis 
passes, a horizontal axis passing through the center and 

at right angles to the tube axis, and a vertical axis 
extending and at right angles to the tube axis and the 

horizontal axis. The effective surface of the shadow 
mask is formed so that, in the region located on the 

horizontal axis, the radius of curvature in the direction 
of the horizontal axis of the surface is larger 

than the radius of curvature in the direction of the 
vertical axis of the surface in a region substantially 

halfway between the center of the surface and a horizontal 
end of the surface, and so that, in the region 

located on the horizontal axis, the horizontal radius of 
curvature is smaller than the vertical radius of curvature 

in a region near the horizontal end portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color cathode-ray 
tube, and more particularly, to a color cathode-ray 
tube in which mislanding of beam attributable to thermal 
expansion of a shadow mask and impact is reduced by 
changing the configuration or curvature of the effective 
surface of the mask and/or the inner surface of an 
effective region of a panel. In general, a color cathode-ray tube comprises a 
phosphor screen formed of three color phosphor layers 
and a shadow mask facing the screen. Three electron 
beams emitted from an electron gun are sorted by means 
of the shadow mask, and a color image is displayed on 
the phosphor screen. The color cathode-ray tube comprises a rectangular 
panel having an effective area whose inner surface is 
formed essentially of a curved surface, and the phosphor 
screen is formed on the inner surface of the effective 
area. On the other hand, the shadow mask includes a 
mask body, which has a substantially rectangular 
effective surface, and a mask frame attached to the 
peripheral portion of the mask body. The effective area 
of the mask body is in the form of a curved surface 
corresponding to the inner surface of the panel in configuration 
and a number of electron beam apertures, 
through which the electron beams pass, are formed in 
this curved surface. The shadow mask is supported on  
 
the inside of the panel in a manner such that elastic 
support members, to which the mask frame is attached, 
are fitted and retained on stud pins on the panel. In order to display a color image having good color 
purity on the phosphor screen, in the color cathode-ray 
tube constructed in this manner, the three electron 
beams passed through their corresponding apertures of 
the shadow mask must be landed exactly on the three 
color phosphor layers which constitute the phosphor 
screen. To attain this, the distance between the panel 
and the shadow mask, especially the distance (value q) 
between the inner surface of the effective area of the 
panel and the effective surface of the mask, should be 
kept within an allowable range. Conventionally, however, the body of the shadow 
mask is formed of a thin carbon steel sheet, and the 
quantity of those electron beams which reach the 
phosphor screen after passing through the apertures in 
the effective surface of the mask body is not greater 
than one third of the quantity of the electron beams 
emitted from the electron gun, that is, most of the 
electron beams impinge on the mask. As a result, the 
shadow mask is heated to
