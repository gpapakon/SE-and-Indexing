<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for locking the door of a cooker. This device comprises, mounted on the chassis, a hooking device comprising a pivoting hook (7) actuated by the displacement of a slide (9) controlled by an actuator (14) which is brought into play at the time of locking and unlocking, the hook coming at the time of locking to engage a catch (4) mounted on the door. Application, in particular, to cookers with cleaning by pyrolysis.

<CLAIMS>
Device for locking the door (3) of an oven, of
the type including a hooking device comprising a hook

(7) pivoting about a spindle (6) under the action of
the movement of a control element (9) mounted on the

chassis of the oven and driven by an actuator (14) set
into operation upon the locking and the unlocking of

the door, the said control element being a slider
shifted linearly, during the locking, the device being


characterised in that
 the hooking device is mounted on
the chassis of the oven, 
in that
 the said hook comes to
interact, during the locking, with a piece (4) of the

door, 
in that
 the said piece (4) is a striker plate
forming a cavity for receiving the said hook, 
in that

the said slider is shifted in such a way as to come
into abutment against a spigot (8) extending the hook

with respect to the spindle, and 
in that
, in unlocked
position, the hook (7) and the piece (4) constitute

elements which do not project with respect to the chassis
and to the door of the oven respectively.
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the actuator consists of a motor (14) equipped
with a cam (13) the movement of which drives the movement

of the slider.
Device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 the motor is caused to start when the temperature
within the oven is higher than a set-point temperature.
Device according to either of Claims 2 and 3,

characterised in that
 the starting of the motor is carried
out by a pulse originating from a microprocessor.
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the actuator consists of a heat-sensitive jack.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the striker plate (4) is mounted
on the upper part of the door (3). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 it further includes a return
spring (15) mounted between the slider (9) and the actuator

(14) for bringing the hook into retracted position.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the unlocking is monitored by a
microswitch (16).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 it is associated with a door-closed
detection device.
