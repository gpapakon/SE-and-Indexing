<ABSTRACT>
In a predominantly indirectly radiating indoor lamp (luminaire), there is arranged at least one main reflector (5) with a roof mirror (51) as well as curved side surfaces (52, 53) as well as at least one light source (4) which is surrounded thereby. The reflector edges limit a first light outlet opening (7) of the lamp. In the transition region between the roof mirror (51) and one of the main reflector side surfaces (52) a recess (6) is provided for the lateral outlet of a secondary light flux (luminous flux, flow of light). An auxiliary reflector arrangement (8) surrounding this recess opens laterally from the first light outlet opening (7). By means of the further light outlet opening (10, 10') thus formed, the entire actively luminescing (glowing, light-emitting) surface of the lamp is enlarged and in the case of a relatively low luminance of the second light outlet opening the contrast in luminance between a high local luminance in the first light outlet opening and the lamp environment is diminished for the purpose of reducing direct dazzling.

Interior luminaire for mainly direct lighting
with glare limitation, in which at least one light

source (4) is arranged inside a main reflector (5)
having a top mirror (51) and curved side surfaces (52,

53), the outer edges of which bound a first light exit
opening (7) of the luminaire, where, in the transition

region between top mirror and at least one of the side
surfaces (52) of the main reflector, there is provided

a cutout (6) for the lateral emergence of part of the
light flux emitted by the light source, there are

provided, open in the direction of a plane containing
the first light exit opening outer auxiliary reflectors

(81 to 84) which are pulled down over the cutout (6)
and of which the outer edges form a further light exit

opening (10, 10'), the luminance of which is lower than
the average luminance in the first light exit opening,

and the auxiliary reflectors direct the light flux
predominantly downwards towards the further light exit

opening and away from the top mirror.
Interior luminaire according to Claim 1,

characterized by
 an arrangement, which is mirror-symmetrical
in cross-section in relation to a luminaire

central axis (3), of two main reflectors (5) and of at
least one light source (4) arranged inside these main

reflectors.
Interior luminaire according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized by
 its configuration as a ceiling 
luminaire in which the two light exit openings (7, 10),

lying in one plane, are arranged essentially flush with
the ceiling in the installed condition of the

luminaire.
Interior luminaire according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized by
 its configuration as a ceiling
luminaire in such a way that the first light exit

opening (7), in the mounted condition of the luminaire,
is arranged offset at a prescribed distance parallel to

the surrounding surface of the ceiling (1), the second
light exit opening (10') is arranged obliquely inclined

to the direction of this ceiling surface and the
auxiliary reflectors (81 to 84) fixing the second light

exit opening are constructed in such a way that part of
the light emitted through this second light exit

opening is directed towards the surrounding ceiling
surface.
Interior luminaire according to Claim 4,

characterized in that
, in the region of the second
light exit opening (10'), there is arranged a light-deflecting

element (12) which scatters light emerging
from this light exit opening in relation to the normal

to the light exit surface.
Interior luminaire according to Claim 5,

characterized in that
 the light-deflecting element is
designed as a transparent light-conducting body (12) of

prismatic cross-section, of which the side surfaces are
arranged in relation to the second light exit opening

(10') and are aligned with each other in such a way
that light which is incident on the light-deflecting

element on one side surface is both deflected as a
result of total reflection in the interior and radiated

as a result of refraction at the other side surfaces.
Interior luminaire according to one of Claims
1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the side wall (52),
forming with its edge inside the luminaire the boundary

of the cutout (6) for the lateral emergence of the
partial light flux, of the main reflector (5), with the

auxiliary reflector (81, 82) facing it, forms one 
mechanical unit with a closed cross-section, partly

composed of straight-line sections.
Interior luminaire according to Claim 7,

characterized in that
 that part (83, 84), facing away
from the main reflector (5), of the auxiliary reflector

arrangement (8) comprises a first reflector part (83)
which is curved, points outwards and is placed directly

on the edge of the top mirror (51) of the main
reflector, and a second reflector part (84) which is

offset outward from the first at a prescribed distance,
with the result that there is formed between these two

reflector parts an interspace which serves as an
exhaust air opening (9) of the interior luminaire.
Interior luminaire according to Claim 8,

characterized in that
 the edge surfaces, forming the
exhaust air opening (9), of the two reflector parts

(83, 84) are designed to overlap over a prescribed
length dependent on their mutual distance apart, as a

result of which the radiation of light through this
exhaust air opening is prevented.
Interior luminaire according to one of the
preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
, in the main
reflector (5), perpendicular to the first light exit

opening (7), upright grating lamellae (11) are arranged
at a prescribed distance from one another for the

lateral glare limitation of the luminaire.
Interior luminaire according to one of the
preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 this is
designed to be rotationally symmetrical in relation to

a plane perpendicular to the luminaire central axis
(3).
Interior luminaire according to one of Claims
1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 this luminaire is
designed to be of square box shape in a plane

perpendicular to the luminaire central axis (3).
Interior luminaire according to one of Claims
1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 this luminaire is
designed to be of elongated rectangular shape in a

plane perpendicular to the luminaire central axis (3). 
Interior luminaire according to one of the
preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 it is equipped
with at least one extended light source (4) of high

light intensity, for example at least one compact
fluorescent lamp or a metal vapour lamp.
