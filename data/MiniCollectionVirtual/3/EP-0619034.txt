<ABSTRACT>
An alkali-soluble novolak binder resin characterized by the condensation reaction of a mixture of phenolic monomers with at least one aldehyde source, said phenolic monomers consisting of: (1) about 2-18 % by weight of said mixture being 2,6-dimethylphenol; (2) about 55-75 % by weight of said mixture being 2,3-dimethylphenol; (3) about 16-40 % by weight of said mixture being a para-substituted lower alkyl phenol selected from the group consisting of 3,4-dimethylphenol, para-cresol, and para-cresol dimer; and the amount of said aldehyde source being at least a stoichiometric amount to react with all of said phenolic moieties. These novolak binder resins may be used in radiation-sensitive compositions useful as positive-working photoresists.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SELECTED NOVOLAK RESINS AND SELECTEDRADIATION-SENSITIVE COMPOSITIONSThe present invention is directed to selected novolak resins made from a phenolic mixture consisting of 2,3-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and selected para-substituted lower alkyl phenols and phenolic dimers. The present invention is also directed to radiation-sensitive compositions useful as positive-working photoresists containing these novolak resins.Photoresist compositions are used in micro- lithographic processes for making miniaturized electronic components such as in the fabrication of integrated circuits and printed wiring board circuitry. Generally, in these processes, a thin coating or film of a photoresist composition is first applied to a substrate material, such as silicon wafers used for making integrated circuits or aluminum or copper plates of printed wiring boards. The coated substrate is then baked to evaporate any solvent in the photoresist composition and to fix the coating onto the substrate. The baked coated surface of the substrate is next subjected to an image-wise exposure of radiation. This radiation exposure causes a chemical transformation in the exposed areas of the coated surface. Visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, electron beam, and X-ray radiant energy are radiation types commonly used today in micro- lithographic processes. After this image-wise exposure, 

 the coated substrate is treated with a developer solution to dissolve and remove either the radiation- exposed or the unexposed areas of the coated surface of the substrate. In some instances, it may be desirable to bake the imaged coated substrate after the imaging step and before the developing step. This bake step is commonly called a post-exposure bake and is used to increase resolution.There are two types of photoresist compositions—negative-working and positive-working. When negative-working photoresist compositions are exposed image-wise to radiation, the areas of the resist composition exposed to the radiation become less soluble to a developer solution (e.g. a cross-linking reaction occurs) while the unexposed areas of the photoresist coating remain relatively soluble to a developing solution. Thus, treatment of an exposed negative- working resist with a developer solution causes removal of the nonexposed areas of the resist coating and the creation of a negative image in the photoresist coating, and thereby uncovering a desired portion of the under¬ lying substrate surface on which the photoresist composition was deposited.
