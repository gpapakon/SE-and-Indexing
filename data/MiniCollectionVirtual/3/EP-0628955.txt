<ABSTRACT>
Hologram elements (321, 322) used as a diffractor 
(32) in an optical head (30) rotate diffracted light beams 

at predetermined angles, to thereby move the light beam so 
that its diffraction angle is altered along predetermined 

directions of the photodiodes of a light receiving portion 
(35). The optical head (30) uses photodiodes which are 

capable of receiving light spots from the diffracted light 
beam, even though the formation location of the light 

spots may vary according to a wavelength change of the 
beam passing through a diffraction and separation portion. 

Thus, a light beam having an altered diffraction angle due 
to a change in wavelength can still be received, and 

focusing error and tracking error which do not include the 
offset can still be detected irrespective of temperature 

change.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical head, and
particularly, to an optical head for use in an apparatus
such as a compact disk player, a CD-ROM, etc., for reading
out recorded information using an optical beam.Generally, an optical head emits an optical beam
generated from a laser diode to an optical recording
medium, and converts the optical beam reflected from the
optical recording medium into an electrical signal using
a photodiode. A reproducing system using the optical head
ensures that the beam projected from the optical head is
exactly focused on the recording medium using an
astigmatism method, a critical angle detection method,
etc. Also, the reproducing system controls the tracking
of the optical head using a 3-beam method, a push-pull
method, etc.A known technique uses six photodiodes, in such a
manner that a focusing error is detected by the
astigmatism method and a tracking error is detected by the
3-beam method. This conventional technology will be
described below with reference to Figures 1 and 2.Figure 1 shows a conventional optical head 10
schematically. Figures 2A through 2E are conceptual
diagrams for explaining focusing errors and tracking
errors in the apparatus shown in Figure 1, in which spots
formed on the six photodiodes are illustrated.Optical head 10 of Figure 1 includes a light
receiving portion 16 having a laser diode 11 for
generating a laser beam and six photodiodes A through F
for generating electrical signals. Between optical 
storage medium 15 in which the information is recorded and
laser diode 11 are disposed in turn grating 12, hologram
lens 13 and an objective lens 14 in the direction toward
optical storage medium 15 from laser diode 11. Hologram
lens 13 controls the positions of the beams reflected from
optical storage medium 15, so as to be incident to
photodiodes A through F of light receiving portion 16. A
support plate 17 keeps a constant distance between laser
diode 11 and light receiving portion 16.The beam projected from laser diode 11 is separated
into three beams by grating 12. The respectively
separated beams passing through hologram lens 13 are
diffracted into a plurality of beams each of which has an
order. The beam which is diffracted in the order of zero
is collected by objective lens 14 and incident to optical
storage medium 15. The beams which are incident to and
reflected from optical storage medium 15 pass through
objective lens 14 again and then are incident to hologram
lens 13. Hologram lens 13 diffracts the beams incident
from objective
