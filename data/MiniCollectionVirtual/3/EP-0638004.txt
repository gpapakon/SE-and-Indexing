<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for separating cutlery from restaurant waste, and includes a glacis (2) for feeding food waste (17) towards a waste container (3), a stand (1) supporting the waste container (3) and the glacis (2), at least two flaps (6, 6') which are movable between two end positions for separating cutlery from waste (17), at least one detector (8) for sending a signal when an item (7) of cutlery passes over it, and a drive means (10) controlled by the signal such as to cause the flaps (6, 6') to move between their two end positions. At, or immediately under the free end (5) of the glacis (2), the flaps (6, 6') are fastened such as to permit them to move towards or away from each other, thus to provide an extension or a shortening of the glacis (2; 6, 6') for automatic separation and discharge of cutlery items (7) to a cutlery collection receptacle (9) situated in or in connection with the waste container (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus, see 
EP-A-0148139 for separating cutlery, such as knives, 
forks and spoons from kitchen waste, the apparatus 
including a slide or a chute collecting the waste which 
slides on it together with any cutlery in a direction 
towards the opening of a waste receptacle, which is 
supported by a stand, implemented such that the glacis 
is preferably positionally adjustable at the waste 
receptacle, a cutlery collection receptacle situated in 
or in connection with the waste receptacle, at least 
one flap, movable between end positions such as to 
enable separation of cutlery and the prevention of 
these items from coming into the waste receptacle, as 
well as at least one detector arranged at the slide 
before the flaps in the sliding direction of the waste, 
for sending a signal when an item of cutlery passes by 
it, the signal controlling a drive means for causing 
movement of the flap between its end positions. An apparatus for separating cutlery from kitchen waste 
is already known, where the waste containing cutlery is 
accumulated in a special hopper, before the waste is 
fed further downwards into a waste receptacle, the 
operator scraping off the waste from plates and the 
like having to put his hand into the waste to retrieve 
the cutlery thus trapped. This is, of course, not 
regarded favorably by persons cleaning off the dishes 
before they are washed. In many cases it has therefore 
been found that cutlery retrieval has been neglected, 
these items being lost in spite of the measures taken. 
From studies made in restaurant kitchens it has been 
found that not just one or two items, but large amounts 
of cutlery are lost in this way, particularly when the 
restaurant has many customers and the waiters are 
flurried, cutlery being tipped together with waste into 
the waste receptacle, although special arrangements  
 
have been made to catch or arrest and search the waste, 
which could contain cutlery, since it is always unpleasant 
for personnel to retrieve the cutlery, particularly 
in rush-hour conditions. The object of the present invention is to provide an 
apparatus of the kind mentioned in the introduction for 
separating cutlery from waste, werewith the problems 
mentioned above are eliminated. The distinguishing 
features of the invention are disclosed in the accompanying 
claims. As a result of the present invention there has now been 
achieved an apparatus, with the aid of which cutlery 
unintentionally tipped away with waste from a plate or

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for separating cutlery from kitchen 
waste, the apparatus including a slide (2) collecting 

the waste (17) and causing it together with any cutlery 

to move in a direction towards the opening (4) of a 
waste receptacle (3), which is supported by a stand (1) 

preferably implemented such that the slide (2) is 
positionally adjustable at the waste receptacle, a 

cutlery collection receptacle situated in, or in connection 
with the waste receptacle (3), at least one 

flap (6, 6'), movable between two end positions such as 
to enable separation of cutlery and prevention of such 

items (7) from coming into the waste receptacle (3), as 
well as at least one detector arranged before the flap 

(6, 6') in the moving direction of the waste (17) for 
sending a signal when an item (7) of cutlery passes by 

it, the signal controlling a drive means (10) for 
causing movement of the flap (6, 6') between its end 

positions, 
characterized
 in that the apparatus includes 
two flaps (6, 6') fastened at, or immediately below, 

the end (5) of the slide (2) facing towards the opening 
(4) of the waste receptacle (3), such that they are 

movable towards, or away from each other to form an 
extension or a shortening of the slide (2; 6, 6') for 

automatic separation of cutlery items (7) and the 
discharge thereof into said cutlery collection receptacle 

(9). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that the flaps (6, 6') in their first, closed, or 

normal positions form an extension of the slide (2), so 
that waste (17) is discharged into the waste receptacle 

(3) via a sliding surface formed by the flaps (6, 6'), 
which have their second, swung-open positions in the 

longitudinal direction of the slide (2) such as to  
 

permit discharging of one or more items (7) of cutlery 
sensed by one or more detectors (8) down into the 

receptacle (9) directly from the slide (2) itself. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that the first or normal positions of the flaps (6, 6') 

are when they are open or apart, the waste (17) then 
discharging directly from the slide (2) into the waste 

receptacle (3), and in that the second or closed positions 
of the flaps (6, 6') are when they form an extension 

of the slide (2) for discharging one or more 
items (7) of cutlery sensed by one or more detectors 

(8) into the cutlery collection receptacle (9). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the previous 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the mutually opposing, 
partable long side edges (19, 19') of the flaps (6, 6') 

extend along an axis of symmetry (20) in the longitudinal 
direction of the slide (2) in the first, closed, or 

normal positions of the flaps (6, 6'), which are swingably 
movable from said first positions. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the previous 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the flaps (6, 6') are 
carried by arms (12, 13) which can be swung towards and 

away from each other and are situated under the slide 
(2), said arms being pivotable on journalling pins 

(14, 15) and arranged for synchronous coaction at these 
pins with the aid of meshing teeth (16). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the previous 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the slide formed by both 
flaps (6, 6') for the waste (17) has a cross section in 

the form of an inverted V, in their closed positions 
said flaps covering the opening (22) of the cutlery 

collection receptacle (9), and being pivotably fixed  
 

along their long edges (21, 21') at the opening. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the previous 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the cutlery collection 
receptacle (9) is removably arranged centrally in the 

waste receptacle (3) and extends right across its opening 
(4), the respective flap (6, 6') having at one of 

its short sides (23, 23') a guide pin (24, 24') for 
connectable coaction with a gripping means (25, 25') on 

the respective pivotable arm (12, 13). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized
 in 
that the respective flap (6, 6') has an elongate rectangular 

shape, said flaps being pivotable from their 
closed positions to their second, open positions where 

said flaps (6, 6') form a hopper-like opening (22) on 
top of the receptacle (9) for catching cutlery items 

(7).
