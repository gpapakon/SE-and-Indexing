<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an electronic circuit of
a device which guarantees to a motor vehicle
battery the minimum charge reserve necessary to
start the engine.It is well known that in the last few years the
level of optionals offered on motor vehicles is
very high. It is sufficient to think about the
electric movement of the seats, of the side
mirrors, of the windscreen wipers, of the sun
roof, and to think about car radio systems etc.
This necessitates the use of electric actuators,
working continually or intermittently, which
represent an ever increasing load on the on board
power energy generation and storage system.It is just as well known that the dimensions of
said system, comprising an alternator and a
battery, are decided according to the principle,
which is certainly valid even in theory, that the
battery must be capable of guaranteeing engine
start up in all climatic conditions, while the
alternator must guarantee the average load curve,
with the help of the buffer battery for peak
loads. It has to be guaranteed, however, that the
battery electric balance is substantially 
balanced. Otherwise the battery would run down
sooner or later, usually without any consequences
during operation, but becoming impossible or
difficult to start the engine after a stop,
especially if it is prolonged and in winter
temperatures.Electronic circuits which guarantee that a battery of a
motor vehicle has a minimum charge reserve necessary to
start an engine and also that a relay disconnects the
battery from a load node for certain voltage values of
the battery are known.For example, EP-A-0 055 149 discloses an electronic
circuit comprising a feed circuit with a zone for the
switching of a battery from a load node to an alternator
excitation node and vice-versa and a control circuit, which switches a
relay for certain voltage levels of the load node.Further, from US-A-4,902,956 is known a device that,
when the state of charge of a battery falls below preset
values, activates a switch, which disconnects the
battery from the vehicle wiring circuit, in order to
save sufficient energy to the battery for engine
ignition.Moreover, WO-A-90 02 670 discloses an electrical supply
control system for a motor vehicle, in which the battery
voltage is compared with two reference values of
voltage. The battery is isolated from the electrical
system in response to low battery signal to preserve
some battery charge an is reconnected by The drivel on
return on the vehicle.However, electronic circuits of the type described above
have
