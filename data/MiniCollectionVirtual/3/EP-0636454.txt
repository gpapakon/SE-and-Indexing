<ABSTRACT>
A device is described for manual assembly and removal of a 
working disc (12) in a manual tool for machining surfaces. The 

tool comprises a hub (9) on which the working disc (12) is 
screw-fastened and that is rotatably held eccentrically by a 

support casing (7) made to rotate on its own axis by a driving 
shaft (2). The device comprises a pushbutton (26) that can be 

accessed from the outside and that can slide between an at rest 
position and a position where it engages one of its ends with a 

mechanical element (16) integral with said hub (9) to prevent 
the rotation of the hub (9) while the working disc (12) is 

screwed or unscrewed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power operated 
manual tool for 
machining surfaces, such as lapping machines, grinding machines 
and such like, in which an orbitally moved working disc is provided. Lapping machines and other manual tools for machining 
surfaces are commercially available that use a working disc 
screw-fastened to a hub eccentrically and rotatably held by a 
support casing made to rotate on its own axis by a 
suitably-operated driving shaft. In these tools the problems arises of assemblying or 
removing the working disc when its replacement is necessary. 
Such operations require that the rotation of the rotating hub 
be stopped while the disk is screwed or unscrewed. The greatest difficulties do not arise so much in the 
screwing or unscrewing operation of the working disc, that can 
often be done by hand, but in preventing the rotation of the 
hub, that generally requires the use of a spanner or other 
tool, with the consequent design of the tool casing with holes, 
operating spaces and so on. Problems are even more evident in those tools equipped with 
a dust collection system, where suitable shrouds are provided 
that make for difficult access to the rotating hub from the 
outside. One known solution that allows the rotation of the hub to be 
stopped without any direct action on the hub provides for the 
hub to have two diametrically-opposed flat milled portions on  
 
the external surface of the hub, and for the working disc to 
have an upper tubular end with a diameter such that it can be 
engaged on the hub, which end is also provided with two 
diametrically-opposed sections with a flat surface; when the 
disc is engaged on the hub, the two pairs of flat surfaces 
prevent relative motion between disc and hub, so that, if the 
disc is held with one hand, the rotation of the hub is 
prevented, and it becomes possible to screw up the working disc 
on the hub with an Allen screw inserted in a through hole in 
the centre of the disc. However, the solution described has the drawback that it 
requires an Allen screw, not always immediately available, and 
there is also the risk that the Allen screw is lost. DE-A-3234254, US-A-4489525 and US-A-3334448 disclose power tools provided with 
hub locking means operating on the hub of a solely rotating working disc.  
 In view of the state of the art now described, the object of 
the present invention is to provide a power tool with a device that allows the 
completely manual assembly and removal of an orbitally moved working disc, 
without
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Power operated manual tool for machining surfaces, 
comprising a working disc screwed onto a hub which is rotatably 

held by a support body caused to rotate about its own axis by a 
power operated driving shaft, an external casing for said hub, 

said support body and said driving shaft, and hub locking means 
for preventing the rotation of the hub while the working disc 

is being screwed and unscrewed with respect to the hub for 
assembling and disassembling purposes, characterized in that 

the hub (9) is eccentrically held by the support body (7) so as 
to cause an orbital movement of the working disc (12) in a 

plane perpendicular to the axis of the hub (9) as a result of 
the rotating movement of the driving shaft (2), and said hub 

locking means (16, 17, 26) comprise a plate (16) rigidly 
mounted on the hub (9) and provided with at least one radial 

arm (17) extending in a further plane perpendicular to the axis 
of the hub (9) and a pushbutton (26) which is mounted on a 

lateral extension of the external casing (13-15, 20) so as to 
be manually operable from outside to move in a direction 

transversal to the plane of said radial arm (17) from a rest 
position to a working position in which said pushbutton (26) 

engages said radial arm (17) to prevent its rotation around the 
axis of the hub (9). 
Tool according to claim 1, characterized in that elastic 
means (27) are provided to urge said pushbutton (26) towards 

said rest position. 
Tool according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
pushbutton (26) is slidingly mounted on said lateral extension 

of the casing (13-15, 20).
