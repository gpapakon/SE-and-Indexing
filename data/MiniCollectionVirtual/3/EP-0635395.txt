<ABSTRACT>
An information unit in a motor vehicle is described which includes an electronic circuit (10) which can be connected to an on-board network of the motor vehicle, one or more sensors (41, 42, 43), a display device (40) and, if desired, operating elements (52, 54). In order to design the display device (40) so that it is easily comprehensible to the driver, provision is made for the sensor (41, 42, 43) and the circuit (10) to be accommodated in the casing of a motor vehicle rear view mirror (1), the circuit (10) being connected to a cable (30) which is guided through a hollow supporting arm (20) of the rear view mirror (1) and can be connected to the on-board network, and the display device (40) being integrated in the mirror glass (5) of the rear view mirror (1).

<CLAIMS>
Information unit in a motor vehicle comprising an 
electronic switch circuit (10) connectable to the supply 

system on board of the motor vehicle as well as one or 
several detectors (41, 43, 45), a display and as the case 

may be operating elements (52, 54), the detector and the 
switch circuit (10) being lodged in a casing (2) of the 

inside mirror of a motor vehicle (1), the switch circuit 
being conducted through the hollow supporting lug (20) of 

the inside mirror (1) and connected with the cable 
connectable to the supply system on board, the display (40) 

being integrated into the mirror glass (5) of the inside 
mirror (1), characterized in that a microphone (65) is 

mounted in the inside mirror, which microphone is connected 
to the computer on board of the vehicle and serves as 

handsfree device for the telephone on board. 
Unit according to claim 1, characterized in that in the 
inside of the casing (2) a VHF antenna is provided for 

which has advisably the shape of a long electric conductor 
and is electrically connected to a switch circuit (10).
