<ABSTRACT>
A device for switching off a high-tension circuit, which is preferably supplied with a high DC voltage, has a switching contact (1), which can be operated by a measured variable, and a high-tension fuse link (2), which is connected in parallel with this switching contact (1) and whose design operating current is less than the rated current flowing in the high-tension circuit. If the switching contact (1) opens in the event of an unacceptably high rise in the measured variable, then the total rated current flows via the high-tension fuse link (2) so that it responds and interrupts the circuit without any arc occurring on the switching contact (1).

<CLAIMS>
A device for switching off a high voltage circuit, preferably a circuit 
supplied with a high direct-current voltage, with at least one 

switching contact (1, 1', 1") which is disposed in the circuit and 
can be actuated in dependence on a variable, for example a 

temperature or a pressure, a high voltage cut-out (2) being 
connected in parallel with the switching contact (1) or the switching 

contacts (1', 1"), the rated current of the cut-out being smaller than 
the nominal current (i) flowing in the high voltage circuit, 

characterised in that, when the nominal current (i) flowing in the 
high voltage circuit makes itself apparent, the high voltage cut-out 

(2) responds with a time lag. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that a plurality of 
switching members (1', 1"), which can be actuated in dependence 

on different variables, are connected in series, and in that the high 
voltage cut-out (2) is connected in parallel with this series 

connection. 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the high 
voltage cut-out (2) is a fusible cut-out.
