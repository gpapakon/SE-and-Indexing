The instant invention concerns a genuine leather 
insole (2) with a semi-rigid bearing frame, moulded in 

thermoplastic rubber (TR), made up of an annular edge (3), 
from one side of which to the other there extend 

transversally several rows of ribs (4), also moulded in 
(TR), along each of which a series of regularly spaced 

cylindrical bristles (5) is made during the moulding 
phase; it being provided that the sheet of leather 

also has transversal rows of small holes (2a) positioned 
alternately with respect to the ribs underneath.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant patent application for a utility model 
concerns a leather insole with a semi-rigid bearing 
frame, moulded in thermoplastic rubber (TR). It should immediately be noted that in this case the 
insole means the hygienic insole which is usually 
inserted and positioned inside the vamp, once the 
manufacturing process has been terminated, in order to 
finish off the inside of the shoe, by covering the 
seams or the points at which the vamp is glued to the 
mid-sole and / or to the actual sole. In the vast majority of cases, said insoles are made 
of genuine leather, in such a way as to be able to 
offer the foot a resting surface which is as hygienic 
as possible, given the fact that leather, on the one 
hand, is able to absorb any perspiration and on the 
other, is able to reduce the level of perspiration due 
to its excellent transpiration properties, which allow 
the heat generated inside the shoe to be expelled to 
the outside. Recently, insoles have been put on the market, which 
comprise one sheet of genuine leather glued to a 
layer, of more or less uniform thickness, moulded in 
TR, from the lower face of which there protrudes a 
closely packed series of almost conical bristles, 
decreasing in height from the heel towards the tip, 
which have the aim of making the insole anatomical and 
at the same time, soft and yielding. If it is true that this aim has been satisfied by 
adopting the said layer of TR covered with bristles,  
 
then it is also true that said layer creates 
considerable difficulties. First of all, the sheet of leather's capacity of 
transpiration is completely eliminated, the pores 
being totally obstructed by the thermo-plastic 
material which covers the entire lower surface of the 
sheet of leather. The immediate consequence of this obstruction is that 
instead of relieving the natural perspiration of the 
foot, this is actually accentuated, because the 
reduced capacity of heat elimination brings about the 
overheating of the inside of the shoe, thereby 
favouring said perspiration. Moreover, because the sheet of leather is highly 
aborbent, it gets so moist as to be almost wet, 
becoming impregnated with the unpleasant smell typical 
of moulded thermoplastic rubber, which cannot be 
eliminated. The aim of the instant invention is to create a new 
model of geniune leather insole, which will not be 
affected by the problems described above, even though 
it will be provided with a soft and anatomical 
supporting structure moulded in TR. The model of insole according to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Insole in geniune leather with a semi-rigid bearing 
frame moulded in thermoplastic rubber (TR), 

characterised by the fact that it comprises a sheet 
(2), of genuine leather, glued to a semi-rigid bearing 

structure moulded in TR, made up of an annular edge 
(3) with a profile in conformity to the profile of the 

perimeter of the sheet (2) above it, and of decreasing 
height from the heel towards to the toe; it being 

provided that from one side to the other of the edge 
(3), there extend transversally, at regular intervals, 

several rows of ribs (4), also moulded in TR, along 
each of which a series of regularly spaced cylindrical 

bristles (5) is made during the moulding phase, which 
in the back and central areas of the insole (1) 

protrude from the related rib, while in the front 
area, said bristles (5) are of a height equal to the 

height of the corresponding rib; it being provided 
that the height of the ribs (5) decrease gradually 

from the heel towards the toe following the gradual 
thinning out of the edge (3), it being provided, 

finally, that the sheet of leather (2) have in its 
turn, transversal rows of small holes (2a), positioned 

alternately with respect to the ribs (4) underneath.
