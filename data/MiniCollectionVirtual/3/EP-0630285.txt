<DESCRIPTION>
APPARATUS FOR THE INDICATION OF A PREDETERMINED NUMBER OFSHAKING MOVEMENTSThe invention relates to an apparatus for indicating a predetermined number of shaking movements.Many medicaments are oil-in-water emulsions or suspensions, which means that they consist of two components, of which at least one is a liquid, which components separate after a prolonged period of settling. Medicaments of that kind must be strongly shaken before use, so that a homogeneous mixture results. The intensity of shaking has hitherto been at the user's own discretion. Therefore there is a need for a device advising the user that the medicament has been shaken sufficiently.Similar difficulties are known from other fields, for example in fuel mixtures for two-stroke engines, in diagnostics and, quite generally, in chemical analyses.The invention is based on the object of producing an apparatus furnishing an indication as to whether a container has been subjected to a predetermined number of shaking movements. According to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for the indication of a predetermined number of shaking movements, comprising means for translating the shaking movements into a movement of an indicator means from a starting position to an indicator position after the predetermined number of shaking movements.The means for translating the shaking movements into a movement of an indicating means may include an element, which due to its inertia moves relative to the 

apparatus when the apparatus is moved. It is at least univariant with the freedom of translation or of rotation, itself serving as an indicator means, or the movement of the element is transmitted positively or non- positively to the indicator means, which is thereby moved from the starting position into the indicator position after a predetermined number of shaking movements have been carried out.The movement of the indicator means from the starting position into the indicator position may be a rectilinear or a rotational movement. The indicator means may be, for example, a strip-shaped element which in its starting position projects from the upper surface of the apparatus and in the course of a predetermined number of shaking movements moves downwardly thus projecting from the bottom surface of the apparatus when being in its indicator position. Stop-dogs engaging with the strip-shaped element may cause the strip-shaped element to be moved only in one direction by action of the shaking movements. The reset movement of the indicator means

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS;
1. Apparatus for the indication of a predetermined number of shaking movements, comprising means for translating the shaking movements into a movement of an indicator means from a starting position to an indicator position after the predetermined number of shaking movements.
2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the means for translating the shaking movements into the movement of the indicating means is a ratchet mechanism.
3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the ratchet mechanism comprises a ratchet element moving to and fro by action of the shaking movements.
4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the ratchet mechanism incorporates a. toothed element.
5. Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the toothed element is a gear wheel.
6. Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims
3 to 5, wherein the ratchet element moves the toothed element intermittently whereby, after the toothed element has been moved by a predetermined number of teeth corresponding to the predetermined number of shaking movements, the indicator means has been caused to move from the starting position to the indicator position.
7. Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 6, wherein the ratchet element is a ratchet ring 


surrounding the gear wheel and incorporating a stop-dog projecting inwardly and engaging with the teeth.
8. Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein the ratchet ring can be set swinging by a weight resting in a freely movable bearing.
9. Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the indicator means is a slide carrying a projecting pin and the gear wheel possesses a recess, the pin clicking into the recess at each complete revolution of the gear wheel, thus releasing the slide.
10. Apparatus as claimed in claim 9, wherein the slide, by being moved, makes different portions of its surface visible through a window.
11. Apparatus as claimed in claim 9 or claim 10, wherein the slide, when being reset, causes.a slight rotational forward movement of the gear wheel so as to prevent the pin from clicking into the recess.
12. Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 9 to 11, wherein the slide comprises at the bottom a projecting part which projects downwardly when the pin clicks into the recess, so as to cause the slide to be reset when the apparatus is placed on a surface.
