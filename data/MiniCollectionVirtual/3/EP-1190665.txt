<ABSTRACT>
Rotary nozzle (10) for washing machines comprising at least
a chamber (33) inside which objects to be washed are placed,

said nozzle (10) being able to deliver towards said objects
a liquid detergent and comprising a first fixed component

(11) to feed and distribute said liquid detergent and a

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a rotary nozzle to deliver liquid
detergent solutions in washing machines.The invention is suitable to be used in industrial
machines to wash containers of a certain depth, for example
those used in hospital structures to wash containers for
physiological needs (bedpans and urine bottles).The state of the art includes rotary nozzles in washing
machines able to deliver liquid detergent.In some embodiments, the rotation of the nozzles is
imparted by the pressure of feed of the liquid detergent
itself which, emerging from holes made tangentially on the
body of the nozzle, causes it to rotate.This solution is advantageous in small-dimension rotary
nozzles, for example those used in domestic dish washers,
but it is inefficient in the bigger nozzles used in
industrial washing machines designed to penetrate in depth
into the objects to be washed.In such machines the rotation of the nozzle is normally
imparted by an auxiliary system which makes the machine more
complex and more costly.A solution has been proposed wherein the nozzle is
associated with a drive assembly comprising a blade rotor
made to rotate by the liquid detergent fed tangentially and
able to transmit the rotational motion to the nozzle.In this solution, the pressure of the liquid detergent
determines a speed of rotation which is too high for the
nozzle; this makes it necessary to insert, between the rotor
and nozzle, a plurality of reduction gears by means of which
the speed is reduced before it is transmitted to the nozzle. 
However, this makes the rotation system of the nozzle more
complex, costly and bulky, and again has the disadvantages
of conventional auxiliary systems.Maintenance operations are also long and impractical, due
to the high number of components.The present Applicant has devised and embodied this
invention to overcome these shortcomings and obtain other
advantages.The invention is set forth and characterized in the main
claim, while the dependent claims describe other
characteristics of the invention.The purpose of the invention is to achieve a rotary nozzle
to be used in washing machines to wash objects,
substantially of any type, which will be simple and
economical and wherein rotation will be obtained by directly
exploiting, without reduction elements, the pressure of the
liquid detergent which the nozzle itself is able to deliver.Another purpose of the invention is to achieve a rotary
nozzle able to wash containers of a certain depth,
particularly those for physiological needs, with a shape
able to
