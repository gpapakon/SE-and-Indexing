<ABSTRACT>
A data transceiver system using radio 
orthogonal multiplexing of quadrature amplitude modulation 

(OQAM) is described, wherein a 
plurality of sub-channels occupy equally spaced frequencies and the 

frequency location of sub-channels in the transmitter is realised by 
means of a single modulator with multitone carrier and in the receiver 

the single sub-channels are brought back to the original band by means 
of a single demodulator with multitone carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The advantage of techniques of amplitude modulation in quadrature of 
orthogonal multiplexing (from herein on referred to as OQAM) on radio 
channels for high speed modems and for digital television, in 
comparison with of other classic configurations, is well known from 
technical literature, as resulting for example from the following articles: 
B. Hirosaki, "An Orthogonally Multiplexed QAM System using Discrete 
Fourier Transform", IEEE Trans. on Communications, vol. COM-29, n.7, 
July 1981; T. Long, "Digital Television Broadcasting in Europe", NAB 1992, 
Broadcasting Engineering Proceedings; J. A. C. Bingham, "Multicarrier Modulation for Data Transmission: An 
Idea Whose Time Has Come", IEEE Communications Magazine, May 1990, 
pp. 5-14; B. R. Saltzberg, "Performance of an Efficient Parallel Data Transmission 
System", IEEE Trans. on Communications, vol. COM-15, N. 6, December 
1967, pp. 805-811. The OQAM technique is similar to the "trasmultiplexer", i.e. the digital 
translation of a time divided multiplexed signal (TDM) in a frequency 
divided multiplexed signal (FDM) of several audio channels: this 
technique received great interest to the beginning of the 80's. In fact the  
 
common objective of the two techniques is the location of a certain 
number of digital signals in equally spaced frequencies. The search of completely digital implementations both of the 
trasmultiplexer and of the system OQAM has been pursued from many 
researchers and various solutions to the problem have been described in 
the literature. The greater part of them consisting in variations of the 
technique of Bellanger and others (see article: M.G. Bellanger and J.L. 
Daguet, "TDM-FDM Transmultiplexer: Digital Poliphase and FFT", IEEE 
Trans. on Communications, vol. COM-22, N. 9, September 1974, pp. 
1199-1205), that is based on the fundamental observation that the 
desired frequency location of a certain number digital signals may be 
obtained with a 'scrambling' phase and corresponding 'descrambling', 
using the periodicity of the discrete time signals spectrum. This allows 
to execute all the operations at the speed of the input signals. In the 
original Bellanger technique the phase 'scrambling' is obtained with a 
DFT and the successive 'descrambling' with a bank of Poliphase filters. In the article T.A.C.M. Clasen and W.F.G. Mecklenbräuker, "A Generalised 
Scheme for an All Digital Time-Division Multiplex to Frequency-Division 
Multiplex Translator", IEEE Trans. Circuit Sust., vol. CAS-25, May 1978, 
pp. 252-259,
