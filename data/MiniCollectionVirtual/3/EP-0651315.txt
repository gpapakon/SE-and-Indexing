<ABSTRACT>
A data entry workstation for a computer system comprises a keyboard 
for entering data as a sequence of character strings, each string 

comprising one or more characters from a character set, the keyboard 
being suitable for rapid, high volume data entry. To each of the keys 

(103) one or more characters are assigned so that all the characters in 
the character set are assigned to a number of keys less than the number 

of distinct characters in the character set. A processor means (100) 
processes the entered data, string by string and searches a dictionary of 

words (206, 208) to identify the possible words therein which could 
correspond to each string, given the assignment of characters to the 

keys. The workstation comprises means to identify which word of a 
plurality of corresponding words is correct; and means to record a 

correct sequence of words.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a data entry workstation. In the application of data processing technology one of the more 
prevalent and labour intensive tasks in the manual key-in of data into 
computer memory. This has been improved recently with the advent of 
automatic optical character reading (OCR) assisted data entry which 
enables text data to be extracted from an image of a printed document. 
However, even with this development manual key-in remains an unavoidable 
and substantial component of the overall cost of data acquisition. It has been recognised that the productivity of the key-in process 
depends on the structure of the keyboard used to enter the data. Hence 
extensive efforts have been made to optimise keyboard design. Usually 
these efforts are directed towards designing keyboards having relatively 
few keys. This is based upon the assumption that with only few keys 
present the distance between the keys is shorter and therefore the key-in 
process faster in the sense of there being more keystrokes per unit time. Naturally with a smaller keypad there are less keys than possible 
characters. In the prior art this difficulty has been resolved by having 
certain characters represented by a plurality of key-strokes. An extreme 
example of such a system would be a morse-type key pad with only two 
keys. In these prior art systems overall operator productivity is 
determined by the impact of two opposing effects. On the one hand the 
number of keystrokes per hour is increased. However the number of 
keystrokes per character, and thus the total required number of 
keystrokes is also increased. A variant on this method is disclosed in EP-0243188 which discloses 
a system in which chords of keys activated simultaneously can be used to 
retrieve stored words from a dictionary. The retrieved words rather than 
the entered chords which are applied to the input of a application 
program. US-5,218,538 discloses a similar system in which predetermined 
sequences of characters, ie an abbreviated form of a word including only 
the consonants in a word, are used to identify and retrieve words from a 
dictionary.  However, these prior art techniques require a considerable degree 
of thought on the part of the operator in identifying when and which 
abbreviation or chord can be used. Also the operator must be undergo a 
significant amount of retraining to be able to use them. Furthermore 
these methods require a different set of abbreviations or chords to be 
established for each language in which data is to

Data entry workstation for a computer system comprising a keyboard 
(104) for entering data as a sequence of character strings, each string 

comprising one or more characters from a character set, the keyboard 
being suitable for rapid, high volume data entry, and comprising a 

plurality of keys (103), 
characterised in that 

to each of the plurality of keys (103) one or more characters are 
assigned so that all the characters in the character set are assigned to 

a number of keys less than the number of distinct characters in the 
character set; 

and by 
storage means (105) to store a dictionary of words (206, 208); 

processor means (100) for processing the entered data, string by string 
and searching the dictionary of words (206, 208) to identify the possible 

words therein which could correspond to each string, given the assignment 
of characters to the keys; 

means to identify which word of a plurality of corresponding words is 
correct; and means to record a correct sequence of words. 
Data entry workstation as claimed in claim 1 wherein the plurality 
of keys (103) are arranged on the keyboard substantially in a line so 

that no lateral finger movement is required on the part of the operator 
to enter all the characters of the character set. 
Data entry workstation as claimed in claim 2 wherein the plurality 
of keys (103) comprises eight keys. 
Data entry workstation as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3 wherein the 
key assignments are such that each key has assigned to it the same set of 

characters usually assigned to a given finger for a conventional QUERTY 
or AZERTY keyboard. 
Data entry workstation as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 
the dictionary of words comprises a list of words (208) and a list of 

keystroke sequences (206) each having a pointer to one or more words in 
the list of words and wherein the means for searching the dictionary 

comprises means for locating the keystroke sequence corresponding to the 
character string in the list of keystroke sequences (206) and means for 

retrieving the words (208) in the list of words pointed to by the located 
keystroke sequence. 
Data entry workstation as claimed any preceding claim wherein the 
means to identify the correct word comprises a display device (102) for 

displaying all the corresponding words to the operator and user input 
means (104) to enable to the user to select the correct word.
