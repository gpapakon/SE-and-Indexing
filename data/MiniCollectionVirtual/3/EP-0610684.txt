<ABSTRACT>
A cover interlock mechanism (12) for a thermal 
printer (10) is diclosed which locks the thermal printer 

cover when printing is being done and, when the print 
head (16) is in a disassembled position, unlocks the cover.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal
printer with a main support structure.Thermal printers often provide a mechanism to
replace the thermal dye donor media and/or the dye
receiver media in the printer by opening a portion of
the printer. To open the printer, the user releases a
latch in a cover mechanism and swings the cover open to
gain access to the media supplies. These cover
mechanisms are usually located in the top portion of the
printer, opening upward.The cover mechanism can have some of the major
printer components attached to it, so that as the cover
is swung open these components move away from media to
permit easier loading of new media or for maintenance.
The cover mechanism usually has a hinge or pivot axis
along one side and a latch which keeps the cover closed
during operation but permits opening the cover for
loading media. To permit proper latch operation and
opening, the cover cannot be rigidly locked to the rest
of the thermal printer structure. The latch can usually
be operated at any time, without regard to current
printer operational status. Thus it is possible to open
the cover mechanism when the printer is operating. Such
situations can result in defective prints, operating
problems requiring user intervention or even damaged
equipment.US-A-5,198,836 shows for example a line
thermal printer having a cover plate and a print head
assembly. In the normal state during use of the printer
the cover plate should be held in a closed position by a
set of screws. However, the screws can be unscrewed and
the cover plate can be opened at any time even during use
of the printer, which can lead to the disadvantages of
defective prints etc. as set forth above. The object of the present invention is to
eliminate defective prints, media jams and printer
equipment damage caused by opening the cover mechanism
when the printer is operating.This object is achieved in a thermal
printer as set forth in claim 1 or 2. The printer may
have a main support structure, comprising a cover
mechanism, movable between open cover and closed
cover positions, said cover mechanism including
latching means with a first position for holding the
cover mechanism in the closed cover position and a
second position which permits said cover mechanism to
be moved to the open cover position; a print head
assembly movable between a print position and a
retracted position; and an interlock mechanism
responsive movement of said print head assembly said
interlock mechanism locks said latching means to
prevent moving said

<CLAIMS>
A thermal printer (10) with a main support structure (20) comprising:

a) a cover mechanism (12);
b) a print head assembly (16) movable between a print position and a retracted
position; and
c) an interlock mechanism responsive to the movement of said print head
assembly (16).
A thermal printer (10) with a main support structure (20) comprising:

a) a rotatably mounted cover mechanism (12) movable between open cover
and closed cover positions, said cover mechanism (12) including latching

means with a first position for holding the cover mechanism (12) in the
closed cover position during operation and a second position which permits

the cover mechanism (12) to be moved to the open cover position at other
times;
b) a print head assembly (16) movable between a print position and a retracted
position; and
c) an interlock mechanism responsive to the position of said print head assembly
(16) such that when said print head assembly (16) is in the print position,

said interlock mechanism locks said latching means in the first position to
prevent moving said cover mechanism (12) from the closed cover position,

and further when said print head assembly (16) is in a retracted position,
said interlock mechanism releases said latching means so that said latching

means can move to the second position which thereby permits said cover
mechanism (12) to be moved to the open cover position.
A thermal printer (10) as set forth in claim 2, wherein said latch means includes:

a) a latch (14) movable between closed and open positions; and 
b) a locking rod (34), movable between closed and open positions in response
to the position of said latch (14), such that when said latch (14) is in its

closed position said locking rod (34) is in its closed position, thereby locking
said cover (12) in the closed cover position, and further when said latch (14)

is in its open position, said locking rod (34) is in its open position, thereby
unlocking said cover so that said cover can be moved to the open cover

position.
A thermal printer as set forth in claim 2 or 3, further including:

a) defining said print head assembly (16) by an interlock surface; and
b) said interlock mechanism further including a rotatably mounted interlock
plate (36) defining a rod engaging surface (30) and an interlock engaging

surface (28) whereby, when said print head assembly (16) is in the print
position, said interlock surface (32) is spaced away from said interlock

engaging surface (28) and said rod engaging surface (30) engages said
locking rod (34), thereby restraining said locking rod (34) in its closed position;

and further, when said print head assembly (16) is in the retracted position,
said interlock surface (32) engages said interlock engaging surface

(28), causing said interlock plate (36) to rotate until said rod engaging surface
(30) disengages said locking rod (34) so it can move from its closed

position to its open position, thereby permitting movement of said cover
mechanism (12) to the cover open position.
