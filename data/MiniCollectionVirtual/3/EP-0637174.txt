<ABSTRACT>
A method for transmitting pieces of synchronized picture 
data having the same data length of which each include a 

synchronizing signal, an identifying code, pieces of 
compressed picture data having different data lengths and an 

error correcting code in that order is disclosed. To correctly 
decode each of the compressed picture data, it is required to 

start an decoding operation from a head address of each of the 
compressed picture signal. Therefore, in cases where a head 

address of a piece of compressed picture data exists in a 
piece of synchronized, an existence information flag for 

informing the existence of the head address, an address 

pointer for indicating an address of the head address, and a 
block number for indicating a position of the compressed 

picture data having the head address are added just after the 
identifying code to correctly decode the compressed picture 

data and other pieces of following compressed picture data in 
the synchronized picture data. In contrast, in cases where any 

head address does not exists, a no-existence information flag 
for informing the no-existence of the head address is merely 

added just after the identifying code.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital data
transmission method and apparatus for transmitting a band-compressed
digital signal such as a picture signal or an audio
signal to record and reproduce the digital signal.A digital data transmission apparatus has been utilized
to transmit a band-compressed digital information signal such
as a picture signal or an audio signal. Fig. 1 is a block
diagram of a conventional digital data transmission apparatus.
As shown in Fig. 1, a conventional digital data transmission
apparatus 11 comprises a transmitting system 12 for processing
a digital picture signal representing a digital information
signal, a transmission path 13 for transmitting the digital
picture signal processed in the system 12, and a receiving
system 14 for processing the digital picture signal 
transmitting through the transmission path 13. The processing
in the transmitting system 12 and the processing in the
receiving system 14 are complementary to each other.A digital picture signal designating a frame of picture
data Dp is input to a signal dividing section 15 of the system
12. Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 2(a), the digital picture
signal is divided into pieces of partial picture data DPi (i=
1,2, --, the same shall apply hereinafter). The partial
picture data DPi are respectively composed of 64 pixels (8
pixels in a lateral direction Ã— 8 pixels in a longitudinal
direction) to be orthogonally converted and are allocated in a
plurality of encoded blocks BEi. Thereafter, the partial
picture data DPi are transferred to an orthogonal converting
section 16 and are orthogonally converted into pieces of
converted picture data in each of the encoded blocks. For
example, a discrete cosine transformation is performed for
each of the partial picture data DPi. In this case, energy is
concentrated on lower frequency components of the converted
picture data according to statistical properties of the
picture signal. Thereafter, the converted picture data are
transferred to a quantizing and variable-length encoding
section 17.In the section 17, the converted picture data are
adaptively quantized to produce pieces of quantized data
according to a predicted dynamic range and a predicted length 
of data obtained by quantizing and encoding the converted
picture data in variable-length. Thereafter, the quantized
data are encoded in variable-length and are encoded in run-length
in the section 17. Therefore, a total length of the
converted picture data is reduced in the section 17. In other
words, the converted
