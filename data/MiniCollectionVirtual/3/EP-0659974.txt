Roller blind, wherein a winding shaft, which is 
rotatably supported by its ends on fixed bearing 

journals, at least at its one end is connectable to a 
drive element and comprises at least one locking 

element which locks the winding shaft, which is loaded 
in the unwinding direction of the blind, to the bearing 

journal, characterized in that disposed in an, in a 
peripheral direction, wedge-shaped recess between an 

inner lateral surface of a sleeve attachment (9) fixed 
on the bearing journal (5) and an outer lateral surface 

of a sleeve attachment (3) fixed on the winding shaft 

(1) is at least one rolling body (2) acting as a 
locking element, which becomes jammed in the recess and 

is releasable from the jammed position by means of an 
opening element (8), which is movable in the direction 

of rotation by the drive element (6). 
Roller blind according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sleeve attachment (3), which is fixed relative 

to the winding shaft (1), is rotatably supported on the 
bearing journal (5) and has, in the region of the 

recess in which the rolling bodies (2) are disposed, an 
outer lateral surface extending eccentrically relative 

to the centre line. 
Roller blind according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that a plurality of recesses are formed in a 

peripheral direction between the two sleeve attachments 
(3, 9) and rolling bodies (2) are disposed in pairs 

therein. 
Roller blind according to claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the opening elements (8), which are disposed in 

an axial direction in each case between two rolling 
bodies (2) arranged in pairs, are constructed on a ring 

rotatably disposed on the bearing journal and said ring  
 

is coupled by a planet wheel mechanism (7) to the drive 
element (6). 
Roller blind according to claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that planet wheels (7) disposed in recesses of the 

bearing journal (5) engage at one end into an internal 
gear of the drive element (6) and with the other end 

into an internal gear of the ring which connects the 
opening elements (8) to one another. 
Roller blind according to claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that means of delimiting the angle of rotation of 

the opening elements (8) are provided. 
Roller blind according to claim 6, characterized in 
that each opening element (8) at the inside has an 

axially extending coiled spring (10) and engages with 
said coiled spring into a wider groove (11) at the 

periphery of the sleeve attachment (3) fixed on the 
winding shaft (1). 
Roller blind according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the sleeve attachment (3), which 

is fixed relative to the winding shaft, is constructed 
at one end inside an outer sleeve (1), which is 

insertable in a non-rotatable manner into the open tube 
end of a winding shaft and is rotatably supported on 

the bearing journal (5).
