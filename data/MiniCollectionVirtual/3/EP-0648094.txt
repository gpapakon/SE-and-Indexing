<ABSTRACT>
A guide, and a method of use of the guide, for making resections to the distal end of a femur during the replacement of a knee joint. The guide comprises a miter block, a posterior guide shoe and an interior guide stylus. The miter block has a plurality of guide slots for alignment and orientation of a blade for making the cuts to be made to fit a particular sized implant. The posterior guide shoe is adapted to contact the posterior curved surface of the femur to position the miter block in the posterior/anterior sense against the distally resected femur. The anterior guide stylus is adapted for gauging the size of the femur relative to the size of an artificial knee implant corresponding to the guide. The tip of the anterior guide stylus is at a predetermined location relative the upper surface of the miter block such that the position of the tip will coincide with the anterior end of the articulation zone of the femur when the posterior guide shoe is properly positioned if the correct size miter block and accordingly implant have been chosen. The predetermined location is such that when the miter block is later used as a guide to the anterior resection, the cut will exit the anterior condyle at that end of the articulation area.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SIZING AND CUTTING GUIDE FOR RESECTING THE DISTAL END OF THE FEMURThis invention relates to implantation of artificial knee joints, and more particularly to a sizing and cutting guide and a method of preparing the femur to receive the implant.Background of the Invention The geometry of a condylar knee implant is optimized to transmit the normal forces experienced during the walking process, from the femur, through the implant and down through the joint to the tibia. The complex geometry of the normal knee provides an articulating surface with a constantly varying radius of curvature to allow for this transmission of force to be optimized for all angles of bend. An implant aims to recreate this. To assist in this, the inner surface of the condylar implant should ideally follow a similar varying radius of curvature to maintain the same thickness of material throughout the implant. Because it is impractical to achieve this degree of shaping of the distal end of the femur, the design compromise adopted uses a number of flat surfaces approximating the curved surface. The usual design adopted is made up of five flat surfaces, with the posterior three divided by the cruciate cleft. Five surfaces must therefore be prepared on the distal condyles to exactly match the implant. This is especially important for a press-fit implant where good bone apposition is critical.It is also important to choose a correctly sized knee implant from the range of sizes available to fit the particular individual since individuals knee joints do vary substantially. The choice of the correct implant is important because if too small an implant is used, then the articulation of the knee will be seriously affected and may be grossly unstable with tensioning problems at the extremes of motion. The correctly sized implant will 

imitate the exact dimensions and radii of curvature of the normal knee, by replacing onlyiethat bone which has been removed. Join -tensioning will—be constant throughout the full range of movements and the joint will be stable. With a larger implant the joint will be "tight" with either restricted flexion or laxity and instability during leg extension.The approximate size of a knee implant can be determined prior to the operation by analysis of X-rays of the knee. However, the surgeon will need to make his final size assessment during the process of preparing the femoral condyles.The initial preparation of the condylar bone involves removal of the most distal bone surface perpendicular to the mechanical axis of
