<ABSTRACT>
Air-conditioning installation for room spaces (1), comprising a heat transfer device (4) for preheating supply air (A) by transferring heat from exhaust air (B) into the supply air; heating means including a heating source (11) for further heating the supply air; cooling means including a cooling source (14) for cooling the supply air; and adjusting means (16, 17, 18, 21, 32, 33, 34) for sensing the temperature of the supply air and for controlling the heat transfer device and the heating and cooling means on the basis of the sensed temperature. To simplify the structure of the installation, the heating and cooling sources (11, 14) are connected to the heat transfer device (4) so that the preheating, further heating and cooling of the supply air take place through the common heat transfer device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air-conditioning 
installation for room spaces, according to the preamble of claim 1. A central air-conditioning installation is used 
for heating room spaces in the winter and cooling 
them in the summer by heating or cooling the air 
supplied into the room space, i.e. the supply air. In 
addition, the recovery of heat from the air exhausted 
from the room spaces, i.e. from the exhaust air, and 
the transfer of the heat into the supply air, have 
recently become more common. It is customary to construct separate units for 
all thermic operations, such as a heat transfer 
device for the recovery of heat from the exhaust air 
to the supply air, a heating device for heating the 
supply air, a cooling device for cooling the supply 
air, etc. These devices are each provided with separate 
feed or circulation pipeline systems for the 
heating or cooling energy, including separate pumps, 
safety and closing devices, meters, control valves, 
etc. In addition, a complete adjustment and monitoring 
equipment is required for each unit. Accordingly, a great number of different  
 
devices are required for the air-conditioning installation, 
and considerable costs are caused by the 
acquisition, installation, tuning and maintenance of 
the devices. The costs of the required thermally 
insulated energy transfer pipeline systems and 
adjustment systems are often higher than those of the 
entire air-conditioning machine. These pipeline 
systems require plenty of space in the building, which, 
of course, further increases the costs. If one wants to utilize not only the energy of 
the exhaust air but also other low-energy level waste 
energy, such as condensation heat, still another unit 
is required, which involves extra costs. As there are plenty of devices, the energy consumption 
is easily high. For instance, each heat exchanger 
causes a pressure loss, which increases the 
power consumption of the blower of the air-conditioning 
machine, and each pump consumes power. The costs 
of the electrification of the air-conditioning 
machine are high, as each device has to be provided 
with wiring and contactors, mechanically operated 
switches, safety devices, etc. As all operating units 
are separate, there sometimes occurs undesired overlapping 
of the different operations, such as simultaneous 
cooling and recovery of heat, which further 
increases the consumption of energy and costs. Due to 
the great number of devices, the entity is highly 
liable to disturbances and is difficult to
