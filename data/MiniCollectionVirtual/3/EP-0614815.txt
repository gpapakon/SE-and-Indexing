<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention concerns a carrier bag (1) in semi-rigid 
paper which can be hermetically closed by making 

use of the upper sections (3a,4a) of its longitidinal and 
transversal walls (3,4), of a suitable shape and reinforced 

in cardboard; more particularly, these upper sections 
are able to form a downward facing flap and to fit 

together, by means of a series of lines where folds 
are to be made.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention for a utility model concerns a 
semi-rigid paper carrier bag with an opening which can 
be hermetically sealed without using buttons, ties or 
other means. The article in question can be considered as new and 
interesting in a field in which manufacturing styles 
and solutions have been firmly consolidated for many 
years. In particular, semi-rigid paper bags have been widely 
diffused, in many commercial fields for use in 
consigning goods to buyers. To date, however, these bags have always been produced 
in several typical versions, now traditionally 
standardized; these bags are nomally of a certain size 
and have handles at their top opening. These conventional bags may or may not be able to be 
firmly closed at the top, or they may have some 
specific means of firmly closing at the top, such as 
buttons, ties, fasteners, probably made of plastic 
and in any case always using very low cost methods. Within this technological viewpoint, the article 
according to the invention is intended to be presented 
as something significantly new; as already mentioned, 
it consists of a semi-rigid paper carrier bag in which 
it is provided that that the top opening be closed 
without resorting to conventional means. In fact, the hermetic closing of this new type of bag 
is guaranteed by its own top edges, those which bound 
the opening; actually, these edges, of a suitable 
shape and pre-folded, are able to fit together so as  
 
to completely seal the opening of the bag in a stable 
manner. The coupling of these edges, in spite of providing 
sufficient stablity, it also easy to eliminate, so 
that there are no problems in re-opening the bag in 
question, a major difference compared to what may 
happen with traditional bags which use buttons,ties or 
fasteners. Also from the design point of view, the article is 
particularly attractive and practical and above all, 
the external aspect is so original as to provide the 
commercial businesses wishing to make use of it with 
a considerable degree of individuality. For further clarity of explanation, the description of 
the invention continues with reference to the attached 
drawings, reproduced for illustrative and limitative 
purposes, wherein: 
Figure 1 and Figure 2 are axomometric 
representations of the bag according to the invention 
which is illustrated both in the open and closed 
position: Figure 3 is the front view of one of the transversal 
sides of the bag in question. With reference to the attached drawings, the article 
in question

<CLAIMS>
Hermetically sealed carrier bag in semi-rigid paper, 
of the type made up of a rectangular base (2) with 

vertical walls (3) and (4) opposite each other, of 
which the trasversal walls (3) have a pre-folding line 

(A) at the centre which branches out in an upside-down 
"V" shape towards the bottom of the bag, characterised 

by the fact that at the opening, it has transversal 
sections (3a) and longitudinal sections (4a), 

internally reinforced by thin carton, the height (h) 
of which is equal to half the width (1) of the bag's 

opening, more particularly, sections (4a) are cut in 
such a way as to provide a section in raised profile 

(4b), which covers about half the edge and which is 
linked to the other half by means of a ridge with an 

inclined profile (4c), while the reinforced 
transversal sections (3a) have a pre-folding line in 

the shape of an upside-down "V" (B), with the tip 
corresponding to the top edge and the two ends of the 

"V" corresponding to the corners of the bag which 
bound on opposing sides each transversal wall; it 

being provided that on the bag (1) there be a 
perimetral pre-folding line (c) just below the 

reinforced sections (3a) and (4a)
