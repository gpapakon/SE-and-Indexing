<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electromagnetic
flowmeter for measuring the flow rate of a fluid such as
a conductive fluid, and more particularly to an electromagnetic
flowmeter having a noise elimination function
of effectively eliminating a spike noise component contained
in the flow rate signal, particularly, spike
noises occurring at periods close to the excitation
period and maintaining the response to the flow rate.FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing an example of
the construction of a conventional electromagnetic
flowmeter.The electromagnetic flowmeter includes a detector 1
and a converter 11.The detector 1 includes a measurement tube 2,
electrodes 4 mounted on the inner wall of the measurement
tube 2, and an exciting coil 3 for applying magnetic
flux to the measurement tube 2.The converter 11 includes an exciting circuit 5 for
supplying a current to the exciting coil 3 and periodically
switching the direction of the current, an
amplifier 6 for amplifying electromotive force (flow
rate signal) from the electrodes 4, an A/D converter 7
for sampling an amplified flow rate signal for a preset
period of time and converting the same into a digital
value, a control circuit 8 for controlling the switching
operation of the excitation direction and the sampling 
timings, an arithmetic circuit 9 for processing the flow
rate signal converted in the digital form, and an output
circuit 10 for outputting the flow rate signal.With the above construction, the reason for
periodically switching the direction of a current
flowing in the exciting coil 3 to apply alternating
magnetic flux is that influence on the flow rate signal
given by a DC-like polarization voltage due to the
electrochemical action occurring in the electrodes 4 of
the detector 1 can be reduced (that is, influence by the
DC noise can be prevented by deriving a difference between
flow rate signals sampled in both of the exciting
directions).In the above electromagnetic flowmeter, indication
(output) may become sometimes unstable by a spike noise
caused when solid materials in the fluid collides
against the electrodes 4.The fluctuation of indication can be suppressed to
some extent by increasing the damping constant and
averaging the flow rate signals, but with this method,
the response of the electromagnetic flowmeter must be
sacrificed, and therefore, its inherent performance cannot
be fully exhibited.In the well known measurement technique (JP-A-4 184 122), the technique
for effecting the arithmetic operation by
excluding measurements which
