<ABSTRACT>
The spacer lugs (9) are positioned in a staggered formation on clamping hooks (8). When the clamping hooks are inserted through the holes of the perforated wall, the spacer lugs rest against the front surface of the perforated wall. The size of the spacer lugs is such that, when the clamp part is vertical, they touch the front of the perforated wall, when the frame ends of the clamping hooks protrude slightly beyond the back of the perforated wall, after going through the holes.

Goods holder with a holder portion (2) on which 
units of goods can be arranged and a clamping 

portion (3) which is connected pivotably to the 
holder portion (2) by means of an articulation (7) 

and on which are formed clamping hooks (8) which 
can be pushed through holes (10) in a perforated 

wall (5) and can be brought into abutment with the 
rear of the perforated wall (5), 
characterized
 by 
spacer projections (9) which are offset on the end 

part of the clamping portion which has the 
clamping hooks (8) so that they come into abutment 

with the front of the perforated wall (5) when the 
clamping hooks (8) are passed through the holes 

(10) of the perforated wall (5). 
Goods holder according to Claim 1, in which one 
spacer projection (9) is associated with each 

clamping hook (8). 
Goods holder according to any one of Claims 1 
and 2, in which the size selected for the spacer 

projections (9) is such that, when the clamping 
portion (3) is arranged perpendicular to the 

perforated wall (5), the spacer projections come 
into abutment with the front of the perforated 

wall (5) when the free ends of the clamping hooks  
 

(8) project slightly beyond the rear of the 
perforated wall (5) through the holes (10) of the 

perforated wall (5).
