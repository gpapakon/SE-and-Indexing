<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for determining the type of cell to which a mobile station is attached, in a cellular radio communication system with several types of cells, characterised in that it includes the following operations:   - sending by the management network of the system, intended for the mobile station, of a message, called recognition message, in the form of a sinusoid, the frequency of which, called recognition frequency, is shifted with respect to a frequency called reference frequency, which is known to or can be determined by the mobile station, the shift, possibly zero, between the reference frequency and the recognition frequency being characteristic of the type of the cell, - determination of the recognition frequency by the mobile station,   - determination of the offset between the reference frequency and the recognition frequency by the mobile station, - determination of the type of cell by the mobile station, on the basis of the offset determined.
