<ABSTRACT>
Device for the elimination of humidity in the walls of a building, characterized by having a small number of electrodes (10, 48, 64) to be distributed in at least one wall (12, 50, 66) of said building (5, 60) at a height (h

 _') of a few metres above ground level, a ground connection (16, 68) to be inserted in the ground and conducting wires (20, 22) for connecting each electrode (10, 48, 64) and the ground connection (16, 68) to connectors for a source of d.c. current (18), said electrodes and ground connection being respectively connected to pole (-) and to pole (+) of said source (18). The invention also concerns a process characterized in that a continuous electric circuit is established, with negative polarity being applied to the whole building (5, 60) and positive polarity being applied to a ground connection (16, 68).

<CLAIMS>
Process for combating dampness of the walls of a structure implanted in ground
which permanently fills the cracks, consisting in the creation of an electric circuit the negative

polarity of which is applied to the whole of the structure (5-60) and the positive polarity of
which is applied to the ground in which the said structure is implanted (16-68), characterized

by the fact that it also consists in applying the negative polarity above ground level in such a
way that the electrical field produced between the two polarities is propagated at least in the

part of the structure which is situated at ground level to form a permanent barrier to the rising
of the said dampness up the walls of the structure by capillarity.
Process according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the negative polarity is
applied to at least one point (10-64) of the said structure (5-60) in its most conductive solid

part (12-60-66).
