<ABSTRACT>
A pelletized sustained release pharmaceutical composition including a core element including approximately 0.1 to 95 % weight, based on the total weight of the core element of an active ingredient of low aqueous solubility, approximately 0.1 to 55 % by weight binding agent; approximately 5 to 99 % weight of a core seed; and a core coating for the core element, including approximately 30 to 97 % by weight, based on the total weight of the core coating, excluding filler, of an enteric polymer; approximately 3 to 50 % by weight of an insoluble polymer; and 0 to approximately 50 % by weight of plasticizer, the enteric polymer comprising at least approximately 70 % by weight of the total weight of the enteric polymer and insoluble polymer; the core coating being such that the active ingredient is released in a controlled fashion over an extended period in the intestine but substantially no release occurs in the acid environment of the stomach and blood levels of active ingredient are maintained within the therapeutic range over an extended period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sustained
release pharmaceutical composition, in particular a
sustained release pharmaceutical composition including an
active ingredient of low aqueous solubility, and to a
method of preparing same. The invention is particularly
suitable for active ingredients comprising a non steroidal
anti-inflammatory ingredient, but the invention is not
limited thereto.As is known in the prior art, it is desirable in
the treatment of a number of diseases, both therapeutically
and prophylactically to provide the active pharmaceutical
ingredient in a sustained release form. Desirably the
sustained release provides a generally constant rate of
release over an extended period. Whilst there is known in
the prior art numerous sustained release formulations, the
extension of sustained release regimens to active
ingredients of low solubility, in particular non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID's), has been limited.
NSAID's are widely used pharmaceuticals, for example in
the treatment of acute and chronic pain, particularly pain
associated with degenerative diseases such as arthritis.
It has been found in the prior art that in particular
NSAID's of very slight solubility in water tend to
generate a product which is susceptible to low
bioavailability. Also it has been found that release of
the active ingredient from formulations disclosed in the
prior art may be delayed for a time but once release
begins, the rate of release is very high and similar to
the phenomenon known as "Dose Dumping", which in turn may
lead to rapid increase in plasma concentration, to high
levels thereby producing undesirable side effects. Such
fluctuations in the plasma concentrations of active
ingredient may also increase the likelihood of toxicity.Whilst controlled dosage forms are known in the
prior art, in general these formulations use enteric
coatings which have the disadvantage that once the
formulation passes the gastric environment the coating
thereon begins to dissolve rapidly and completely 
resulting in dose dumping phenomenon. Formulations which
use a sustained release coating have also been proposed in
the prior art. However these have the disadvantage that
partial dissolution often occurs in the gastric environment
which may produce irritation in the gut from active
ingredient such as an NSAID coming into contact with the
gastric mucosa. Other certain active ingredients are
degraded in the stomach environment and therefore exposure
to the low pH gastric environment is desirably avoided. A
