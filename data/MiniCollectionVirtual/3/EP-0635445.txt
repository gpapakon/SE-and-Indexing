<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for the preparation of a wound roll (6) of a 
web of material (12) by utilizing a surface windup device with 

a primary lay-on roll (1) 

that feeds the web of material (12) onto a rotating core, 
winding the web (12) onto the core to form a 

roll (6) by driving the roll of material (6) with a secondary lay-on 
roll (2), the differential in surface speed between the primary 

and secondary lay-on rolls (1,2) controls the tension of the 
web (12) as it is wound. Also 

incorporates are a retractable cutting roll (5) and knife (4) 
assembly that is moved into position to cut the 

web of material (12), assist in transferring the web of material (12) 
to a new core and then retracts to a 

position that does not hinder winding the new roll of wound 
material (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an improved apparatus for winding a web of
material into a roll wherein the tension and compression of the web of material is controlled as
it is wound, and automatically cuts the web of material and starts a new roll and ejects the
finished wound roll of material.Heretofore, in winding or rewinding a web, a dancer roll has been used for the purpose of
absorbing tension variation and thereby controlling tension. However, dancer rolls can create
creases in thinner films and the edges of the wound films cannot be aligned and a dancer still
imparts tension into the web of material being wound. In some winders, a method of adjusting 
tension by controlling the torque of a motor shaft is generally employed or the tension is
detected by means of a fixed roll.A typical means for detecting tension exerted upon a sheet and controlling the same is by the
use of a dancer roll. The tension exerted upon the sheet is detected as an electric signal derived
from a displaced dancer roll actuating a potentiometer or the like. After comparing this detected
signal with a preset value, a driving force is controlled, so as to bring the dancer back to its set
position and thereby exerting tension upon the sheet to a predetermined value. This type of
apparatus has a disadvantage in that the follow-up characteristic of a dancer roll, i.e., its
response to film tension, is not sufficiently high. In addition, by definition, there is always some
amount of tension that the dancer must impart into the web to properly monitor and operate the
drive control. Thus, a typical dancer arrangement cannot be used to achieve zero tension in the
web being wound.Another method employed to control tension is an apparatus in which current through a motor
for driving a spool or core is detected (when the tension of a sheet being taken up becomes
small, the torque of the motor is reduced and thus the current through the motor is reduced) and
thereby the tension exerted upon the sheet is detected. In order to compare the tension of the
sheet with a preset value, the detected current signal is led to a current control system in which
the current signal is compared with a preset current value for the motor in order to control the
motor current. However, this type of apparatus also involves problems in that the response
characteristic for tension control is poor because of the inertia of the mechanical system, and the
sheet is unevenly stretched owing to variations in tension. Assuming that controls similar to those
