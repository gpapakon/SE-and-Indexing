<ABSTRACT>
Contrast agents comprising water-soluble microbubble-generating carbohydrate microparticles in admixture with at least 10 % w/w relative to the overall composition of a non-surface active material which is less water-soluble than the carbohydrate exhibit useful levels of contrast efficiency and/or stability and may be used in diagnostic applications such as ultrasound and MR imaging.

 i -I M P R O V E M E N T S I N C O N T R A S T A G E N T S , C O N S I S T I N G O F G A L A C T O S E P A R T I C L E S .This invention relates to novel contrast agents, more particularly to new microparticulate contrast agents of use in diagnostic imaging.It is well known that ultrasonic imaging comprises a potentially valuable diagnostic tool, for example in studies of the vascular system, particularly in cardiography, and of tissue microvasculature. A variety of contrast agents has been proposed to enhance the acoustic images so obtained, including suspensions of solid particles, emulsified liquid droplets, gas icrobubbles and encapsulated gases or liquids. It is generally accepted that low density contrast agents which are easily compressible are particularly efficient in terms of the acoustic backscatter they generate, and considerable interest has therefore been shown in the preparation of gas-containing and gas-generating systems.Initial studies involving free gas microbubbles generated in vivo by intracardiac injection of physiologically acceptable substances have demonstrated the potential efficiency of such bubbles as contrast agents in echocardiography; such techniques are severely limited in practice, however, by the short lifetime of the free bubbles. Interest has accordingly been shown in methods of generating and/or stabilising gas microbubbles for echocardiography and other ultrasonic studies, for example using emulsifiers, oils, thickeners or sugars.Techniques involving the use of sugars in ultrasound contrast agents are described in, for example, US-A- , 681 , 119 , US-A- , 42 , 843 and US-A-4,657,756, which disclose the use of particulate solids having a plurality of gas-filled voids and preferably 

 also a plurality of nuclei for icrobubbie formation. EP-A-0123235 and EP-A-0122624 suggest ultrasound contrast agents consisting of surfactant-coated or surfactant-containing gas-containing microparticles which may include a variety of sugars. DE-A-3834705 proposes the use of suspensions containing microparticles of mixtures of at least one C10.2C fatty acid with at least one non-surface active substance, including sugars such as cyclodextrins, monosaccharideÎµ, disaccharides or trisaccharides, as well as other . pol ols and inorganic and organic salts.Gas-containing contrast media are also known to be effective in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, e.g. as susceptibility contrast agents which will act to reduce MR signal intensity. Oxygen-containing contrast media also represent
