<ABSTRACT>
A process and product and apparatus are disclosed wherein 
a laser is used to form a conical tapered tip on a 

catheter product. The catheter is placed on an insertion 
needle prior to the formation process, thus eliminating 

the problems associated with wearing out forming tooling. 
The process and product further call for the use of the 

laser to create a surface effect on the cannula to 
indicate the terminus of the catheter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for forming catheter products and particularly to methods
for beveling the tip of intravenous
catheters as described in claims 1, 9 and to a method for simultaneously
trimming and providing surface effect to a catheter and a needle
respectively.Intravenous catheters come substantially in two types of
products. The first type is a through-the-needle catheter
product wherein the catheter that is to be disposed within
the vein is inserted through a sharpened cannula. The
cannula is used to pierce the skin and insert the catheter
and later is removed. However, this type of catheter has
not met with much commercial success do to inherent flaws
in the through-the-needle type delivery system. For
example, the needle must be larger in diameter than the
catheter being inserted. Therefore, the needle creates a
larger opening on insertion than the catheter requires and
creates a greater chance of leakage. Furthermore, it is
difficult to remove and dispose of the needle or cannula
once the catheter has been inserted.The second and more common type of intravenous catheters
is the over-the-needle catheter. In this type of product
a needle or cannula has disposed thereover a catheter.
The catheter is disposed such that the sharpened tip of
the needle is extending from the catheter product and is
used to pierce the patient's skin and insert the catheter.
Once the skin and vein have been pierced, the catheter is
threaded off of the needle and the needle is removed from
the catheter product. In order to ease the insertion of the over-the-needle type
catheter products, it has long been known to bevel the tip
of the catheter to provide a smooth transition between the
surface or outer diameter of the needle or cannula and the
surface or outer diameter of the catheter itself during
the insertion process. There have been many methods
developed for beveling the tips of catheters. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,661,300 to Daugherty entitled
"Method and Apparatus for Flashless Tipping of an I.V.
Catheter" discloses a process which was used in the early
1980's to mold a beveled tip on a catheter while
simultaneously trimming the flash in order to provide a
clean edge to the tip. This process, however, requires a
high cost in retooling because of the wear interface
between the two tool members and the cleaning necessary to
unclog the mold from the trimmed flash.Catheters have also been provided with what is actually a
duel bevel. The bevel begins gently at approximately 3°
and then is

A process for beveling a tip of a catheter having a
tubular sheath comprising:


a) providing a source of coherent light with
sufficient power to ablate the catheter material;
b) positioning said catheter in a path of said
coherent light; and
c) rotating said catheter while impinging said
coherent light on said catheter along a predetermined path

to ablate catheter material at a predetermined tip location.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the path of the
coherent light is at an angle to the tubular sheath to form

a frusto conical tip surface.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the source of
coherent light has a cross sectional shape and power which

ablates said catheter material in a concave shape.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the cross
sectional shape and power of the coherent light impinging on

the catheter is shaped to create a convex tip shape.
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 4
wherein the catheter is positioned upon a cannula prior to

impinging coherent light on the catheter.
The process according to claim 5 wherein the coherent
light impinges on the cannula surface and changes the

catheter surface in the area of impingement to differ from
the remaining cannula surface.
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 6
wherein said predetermined path is approximately 45° to a

longitudinal axis of said catheter.
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
wherein said coherent light is shaped by passing said beam

through a slit mask.
A process for beveling a tip of a catheter having a
tubular sheath comprising:


a) providing a pre-molded tubular sheath having a
predetermined bevel on the outer surface thereof;
b) positioning said catheter at a predetermined
position;
c) impinging an incident beam of coherent light upon
said catheter at a predetermined position while rotating

said catheter to trim said catheter at said predetermined
position.
A process according to claim 9 wherein said catheter is
provided with a needle therein and said incident beam of

light is directed and focused to change the surface of said
needle during said trimming process.
The process according to claim 10 wherein the surface
effect is to increase reflectivity of the surface of said

needle at a position adjacent the end of said catheter.
The process according to claim 10 or claim 11 wherein
said needle is stainless steel.
A process for simultaneously trimming and providing
surface effect to a catheter and needle respectively

comprising:

a) positioning a catheter on a needle to provide a
catheter needle subassembly;
b) positioning said catheter and needle subassembly
at a predetermined position;
c) rotating said catheter and needle subassembly at
said predetermined position while impinging thereon a beam

of coherent light of sufficient energy to ablate the
catheter substance;
d) providing said beam of coherent light for 
sufficient time to ablate the circumference of the catheter

forming a bevel tip and to impinge upon the surface of the
needle with sufficient energy to modify the surface thereof.
The process according to claim 13 wherein said surface
effect modifies the surface of said needle by removing an

oxidized layer from the surface of said needle.
The process according to claim 13 or claim 14 wherein
said needle is stainless steel.
The process according to claim 15 wherein said needle
is 304 stainless steel.
The process according to claim 13 wherein said surface
effect modifies the surface of said needle by increasing the

concentration of chromium at the surface of a stainless
steel needle.
