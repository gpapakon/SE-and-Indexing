<ABSTRACT>
An inexpensive, easily available and convenient method of inhibiting the 
transmission of e.g. the AIDS virus and hepatitis virus in humans as a result 

of sexual intercourse is provided. The invention relies upon a dual mode of 
action of antiviral compositions comprising silver salts, such as silver 

sulfadiazine, in combination with a detergent. These compositions are 
effective to reduce the infectivity of the virus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to composition for inhibiting the 
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases in particular Hepatitis B 
and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a fatal catastrophic disease that presently infects 
millions of people worldwide. Although initially concentrated in central 
Africa and in certain high risk groups in other geographic areas 
including the United States, AIDS is now spreading to other areas and is 
appearing in individuals who are not members of the recognized risk 
groups. As a result, major efforts are being made to develop methods of 
preventing the transmission of AIDS, methods of curing AIDS once 
contracted, and methods of ameliorating the symptoms of AIDS. To date, 
however, AIDS has proven difficult to treat or prevent. AIDS is caused by a virus. This virus has been referred to by a 
number of names in the literature, including HIV (human immunodeficiency 
virus), LAV (lymphadenopathy-associated virus), ARV (AIDS-related virus) 
and HTLV-III (human T-cell leukemia virus-III). For simplicity, the virus 
causing AIDS will be referred to herein as the AIDS virus. It is generally known that viruses can be divided into two groups 
based upon the nature of the virus' genetic material. Some viruses are 
DNA viruses, that is the genetic material is deoxyribonucleic acid, while 
others are RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses. The RNA viruses can further be 
divided into two groups, those in which replication of the viral genome 
proceeds by making an RNA copy directly from the RNA genome and those in 
which a DNA intermediate is involved. This latter type of RNA virus is 
called a retrovirus. The AIDS virus is a retrovirus. Thus, like other retroviruses, it 
has an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (or RNA-dependent DNA 
polymerase) which catalyzes transcription of viral RNA into double 
helical DNA. This DNA sequence is integrated into the genome of the 
infected cell where it is known as a provirus. Subsequent transcription 
of this provirus by the transcription mechanism of the infected cell 
produces new viral RNA for packaging into new virus particles. Because the AIDS virus may lie dormant in an infected cell in the 
form of a provirus for extended periods of time, it has been difficult to 
establish the precise routes by which AIDS is spread. It is known,  
 
however, that AIDS can be transmitted to a person by transfusing that 
person with blood containing the AIDS virus. AIDS can also be transmitted 
to a person through homosexual or
