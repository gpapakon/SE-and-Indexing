<ABSTRACT>
The electrical installation system (electrical service system) for domestic and work place electrification has a distribution box (20) with a 380 V electrical input (ES) which is split in the distribution box (20) into three 220 V circuits (L1, L2, L3); the electricity being output to the load (V1, V2, V3) from each 220 V circuit (L1, L2, L3) via a coded plug connection (21a,21b/22a,22b/23a,23b) which cannot be incorrectly connected. The five-conductor feed cable (ES) which carries 380 V is split in the distribution box (20) into its three live phases (L1, L2, L3) and the neutral and earthing phase (N) for the three circuits (L1, L2, L3), each of which is at 220 V, and each circuit (L1, L2, L3) is wired in the distribution box (20) to a three-pole, coded plug socket (21a, 22a, 23a) to which an electrical cable (24, 25, 26) having a coded plug (21b, 22b, 23b) can be connected, such that it cannot be incorrectly connected, for outputting electricity to the load (V1, V2, V3).

is split in the distributor box (20) between three 220-volt circuits (L1, L2, 
L3), characterised in that the current take-off to the consumer (V1, V2, V3) 

is effected by each 220-volt circuit (L1, L2, L3) via an individual coded,

earthing phase (N, 
) between the three circuits (L1, L2, L3) of 220 v each, 
and each circuit (L1, L2, L3) is wired in the distributor box (20) with a 

three-pole, coded plug-in bush (21a, 22a, 23a), to which for current take-off 
by the consumer (V1, V2, V3) an electrical cable (24, 25, 26) is non-interchangeably 

connectable with coded plugs (21b, 22b, 23b). 
Electrical instailation system according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that each of the three 220-volt circuits (L1, L2, L3) is wired to two 

identically coded three-pole plug-in bushes (21a, 22a, 23a) in the 
distributor box (20). 
Electrical installation system according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that each of the three 220-volt circuits (L1, L2, L3) is wired 

in the distributor box (20) to a coded plug-in bush (21a, 22a, 23a) and 
optionally to an electric switch (27, 28, 29), such as an on-off switch, limit 

switch, time switch or the like.  
 
Electrical installation system according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the coded plugs (21b, 22b, 23b) with the electric 

cables (24, 25, 26) form prefabricated current take-off leads 
Electrical installation system according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the three circuits (L1, L2, L3) are wired in the 

distributor box (20) to a respective coded input and output in the form of a 
plug-in bush, to which optionally the 380-volt supply cable (ES) is
