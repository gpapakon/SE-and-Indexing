<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color diffusion 
transfer photographic material using an alkali treating 
composition, and more particularly to a photographic material 
increased in transfer density and remarkably improved in 
treating temperature dependency of transfer density. A Color diffusion transfer photography method using azo 
dye image forming substances which give azo dyes different from 
image forming compounds themselves in diffusibility as a result 
of development under basic conditions has hitherto been well 
known. As dye releasing compounds, the compounds described in 
US-A- 3,928,312 are known. However, the dye releasing efficiency of these dye 
releasing compounds is not always high, so that the compounds 
have the problem that the transfer density is not sufficiently 
obtained. On the other hand, conventional color diffusion 
transfer film units are used for indoor or outdoor picture 
taking in many cases, and processed through a wide temperature 
range. Hence, the high treating temperature dependency of 
transfer density introduces a serious problem.  
 These tendencies are particularly noticeable in alkali 
treatment at low temperatures. Also in this sense, a technique 
for improving the transfer density and the treating temperature 
dependency of transfer density has been desired. Further, as a means for improving the transfer density 
with additives, a method is described in JP-B-4-13701 (the term 
"JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent 
publication") in which a sulfonamide compound is added as a 
methanol solution to a layer containing a dye providing 
substance, followed by processing at a high temperature in a 
dried film system. JP-B-4-13701, corresponds to EP-A-0 160 313. The heat developable 
photographic material disclosed therein comprises sulfonamide 
compounds according to formula (I) of the present invention. However, addition of the compound disclosed in the 
above-described patent did not show improvements in transfer 
density and treating temperature dependency. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a color diffusion transfer photographic material 
increased in transfer density and remarkably improved in 
treating temperature dependency of transfer density. This and other objects of the present invention can be 
attained by 
a color diffusion transfer photographic material comprising 
a color diffusion transfer light-sensitive element containing 
at least one of compounds represented by the following formula 
(I) and an
