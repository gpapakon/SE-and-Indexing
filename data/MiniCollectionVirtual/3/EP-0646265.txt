<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and device for protecting people or objects, an alarm signal being triggered when people or objects are approached or taken away without authorization. The aim of the invention is to provide a simple method of ensuring discrete, reliable protection for people or objects, while allowing the people or objects unrestricted mobility. To achieve this, the invention calls for an emitter (14) to emit a signal which prevents the alarm signal from being triggered until the distance between the emitter (14) and receiver (2) exceeds or falls below a pre-determined value or the transmission path between the emitter (14) and receiver (2) is interrupted. It is also possible to generate a range signal which is representative of the distance between two protection elements and which produces a variation in the pitch or loudness of the alarm signal, the variation depending on the magnitude of the range signal.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the protection of people or objects in which 
a warning signal is triggered in the event of the unauthorised 

approach or withdrawal of people or objects, where 
a transmitter sends a signal which blocks the triggering 

of the warning signal until the distance between the 
transmitter and the receiver exceeds or falls below a 

predeterminable value, or the transmission path between 
the transmitter and the receiver is interrupted in that a 

distance signal representing the distance between the 
transmitter and the receiver is determined from a receiving 

signal detected by a receiver and compared with a 
preselectable setpoint value, and a positive or negative 

deviation from the setpoint value triggers the warning 
signal, 
character-ised in that
 the 
distance signal triggers a change in the tone or volume of 

the warning signal corresponding to its magnitude. 
A method for the protection of people or objects as per 
Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
distance signal is obtained by measuring the level of the 

receiving signal and subtracting it from the known level 
of the transmission signal. 
A method for the protection of people or objects as per 
Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
distance signal is obtained by measuring the time difference 

between the time of transmission and the time of 
reception. 
A method for the protection of people or objects as per 
Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 a synchronous 
time pulse is generated in both the transmitter 

and the receiver, that the times of transmission are determined  
 

by this time pulse and that the time difference 
between the occurrence of the receiving signal and the 

time of transmission - which is also known in the receiver 
due to the synchronous time pulse generation - is 

measured. 
A method for the protection of people or objects as per 
Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
transmission signal is sent intermittently, where the time 

interval between two transmissions of the transmission 
signal is always the same, and that a distance change signal 

is generated in that the time intervals between receiving 
signals are measured and compared with the respective 

preceding time interval and that the distance 
change signal triggers a change in the tone or volume of 

the warning signal corresponding to its magnitude. 
A method for the protection of people or objects in accordance 
with the patent application as per one of the Claims 

1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 an auxiliary 
transmission signal is sent from an auxiliary 

transmitter located in close proximity to the receiver to 
an auxiliary receiver located in close proximity to the 

transmitter, from which an auxiliary distance signal representing 
the distance between the transmitter and the 

receiver is determined, which changes the tone or volume 
of a warning signal triggered by the auxiliary transmission 

signal in accordance with its magnitude. 
A method for the protection of people or objects as per 
Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 a connectable, 
coded control signal is applied to the transmission 

signal which causes the auxiliary transmission 
signal to be sent continuously or continuously intermittently.  

 
A device for the protection of people or objects with a 
first mounting element, which can be attached to an object 

to be protected, and a portable or variably mountable second 
mounting element, where there is either a wireless or 

wired connection between the first and second mounting 
elements, and with a warning signal transmitter located 

in, or in close proximity to, one of the mounting elements, 
which can be triggered by a change in distance 

between the mounting elements or by an interruption of the 
connection, 
characterised in that
 a 
second transmitter (19) is located in the first mounting 

element (1) and a corresponding second receiver (20), connected 
to a second warning signal transmitter (24), is 

located in the second mounting element (9), and that a 
device (32) for generating an auxiliary distance signal 

and a connected modulation circuit (33) for modulating the 
second warning signal transmitter (24) are located between 

the second receiver (20) and the second warning signal 
transmitter (24). 
A device for the protection of people or objects as per 
Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the 
second mounting element (9) contains a coding circuit (29) 

with an external switch (30) which is linked to an activation 
circuit (31) in the first mounting element (1) via 

the transmission signal in order to activate the continuous 
transmission of the auxiliary transmitter (19).
