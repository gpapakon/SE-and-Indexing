<ABSTRACT>
A cooler for blood plasma cooling bags according to 
the present invention has a plurality of thermoelectric cooling 

units arranged in a scattered state between a cooling plate and 
a radiating plate, a blood plasma bag being cooled with the 

cooling plate, the radiation of heat being carried out by the 
radiating fins provided on the radiating plate and a radiating 

fan for sending air to these fins, the cooler being characterized 
by: (i) a clearance of at least 5 mm being provided between the 

cooling plate and radiating plate; (ii) the thermoelectric cooling 
units being joined at their heat absorption sides to the cooling 

plate via a heat conductive block, and at their radiation sides to 
the radiating plate directly, or the thermoelectric cooling units 

being joined at their heat absorption sides to the cooling plate 
directly, and at their radiation sides to the radiating plate via a 

heat conductive block; (iii) the clearance between the cooling 
plate and radiating plate being filled with a heat insulating 

material, the cooler enabling the time required to attain a set 
temperature to be reduced, and the set temperature maintaining 

stability to be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cooler 
useful for cooling plasma cooling bags, especially a 
plasma cooling bag constituting a plasma cooling portion 
which is provided at an intermediate portion of a plasma 
line for practicing cryofiltration. Cryofiltration is a therapy wherein the plasma 
separated from the blood of the patient is cooled to 
filter off a gellike substance (pathogenic substance) 
produced on cooling. This therapy is effective, for 
example, for patients with rheumatism and has therefore 
attracted attention. Cryofiltration will be described 
with reference to FIG. 7. By the operation of a blood 
pump a, blood is sent from a supply source thereof 
through a blood supply line b to a primary filter C, 
which separates the blood into blood cells and plasma. 
The separated blood cells are sent to a blood cell return 
line d so as to be mixed again with the purified plasma 
to be described below. On the other hand, the plasma is 
sent by the operation of a plasma pump e from a plasma 
line f into a secondary filter h for filtration by way of 
a cooling portion g on the line f. The plasma is cooled 
by the cooling portion g to about 4 C°, and a cryogel of  
 
high-molecular-weight substance produced by the cooling 
is filtered off by the secondary filter and thereby 
removed from the plasma. The filtrate from the secondary 
filter, i.e., purified plasma, is remixed with the blood 
cells returned from the foregoing primary filter while 
being returned through a purified plasma return line i. 
The mixture is thereafter returned to the supply source 
while being heated to the initial liquid temperature by a 
heating bag j. In recent years, a method has been proposed of 
cooling plasma in the cooling portion g by using a 
constant-temperature chamber of the refrigerant (e.g., 
antifreeze solution) circulation type for cooling the 
plasma while the plasma flows through a zigzag channel l 
of a disposable plasma cooling bag k (see FIG. 1). This 
method has the following problems. It is not easy to maintain a constant 
temperature. Further it takes time for the plasma to 
reach the predetermined temperature. Since the 
refrigerant is made usually about 5° lower than the 
desired temperature, the plasma is excessively cooled 
when the circulation of plasma is temporarily 
interrupted. The constant-temperature chamber is difficult 
to make compact, consequently rendering the overall 
plasma cryofiltration system large and difficult to move. The refrigerant splashes to wet the operator or 
the
