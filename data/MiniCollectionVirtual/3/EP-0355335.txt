<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a light-sensitive recording material, to the use thereof and to a novel leuco compound suitable for this purpose. This recording material consists essentially of a mixture of (1) one or more film-forming polymeric binders, (2) a dye precursor system, (3) if appropriate, one or more monomeric compounds having at least one polymerisable ethylenic double bond, (4) if appropriate, a photoinitiator or photoinitiator system which can be activated by irradiation and (5) conventional additives and auxiliaries, the dye precursor system containing a photooxidising agent, a leuco compound of high storage stability and, if appropriate, a sensitiser. This light-sensitive recording material is suitable for use in printing plates or photoresist films.
