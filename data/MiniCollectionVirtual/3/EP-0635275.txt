<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent structure comprising a low density 
cellulosic core formed from a blend of 70-97% by weight 

of cellulosic fibres and 3-30% by weight of polyethylene 
pulp, based on the total weight of the cellulosic fibres 

and polyethylene pulp, is disclosed. The polyethylene 
pulp is formed from polyethylene having a density in the 

range of 0.930-0.965 g/cm³ and a melt index of less than 8 
dg/min. The polyethylene pulp has monocomponent fibres 

and the core has a matrix of bonded polyethylene pulp. 
The blend may contain super absorbent polymer. Absorbent 

structures of improved properties are obtained e.g. for 
use in diapers and other absorbent structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent web structure which has both 
mechanical strength properties and absorbing properties. More specifically, the invention 
relates to an absorbent material comprised of a blend of polyolefin pulp and cellulosic 
pulp that has been thermally bonded together to form an absorbent structure where the 
fibres of the polyolefin pulp are only partially melted and form a matrix of fibres, with 
improved properties at equivalent polyethylene pulp contents or equivalent properties at 
reduced polyethylene pulp contents. Polyethylene pulp is formed by flash spinning of fibres from solutions of 
polyethylene in solvent at temperatures above the melting point of the polymer. For 
instance, the fibres are normally in the form of discontinuous fibres with a length of 1-10 
mm which are refined to a length of 0.8-1.20 mm to form a polyethylene pulp. Such pulp 
has been used as a binder fibre in low density cellulosic webs, for example as absorbent 
pads in disposable products e.g. diapers and feminine hygiene products. With the addition of polyolefin pulps to cellulosic pulps to form absorbent cores, 
improved performance, especially increased web integrity, may be obtained by thermally 
bonding the synthetic pulp to the cellulosic pulp. This has been described as involving 
melting of the synthetic pulp to form so-called "solder joints" of collapsed fibrils in the 
cellulosic matrix e.g. see "Thermal Bonding of Absorbent Cores - Do's and Don'ts" by 
Steven C. Apostolico, IMPACT 89, Miller Freeman Publications, 500 Howard St., San 
Francisco CA 94105 USA. The creation of the solder joints by melting and flowing the 
polyethylene to provide junctions with the cellulose fibres was stated therein to give the 
bonded core its strength. The strength of the core was defined by the bonding index, K, 
which was defined as follows: 
K = force to break in grams(width)(density)(basis wt.)(% cellulose)(% PE)where PE = polyethylene.
 
The paper reported K values of 50-60 cm⁴/g.  In an alternative system, bicomponent binders have been used, with the sheath 
component acting as a binder on heating to facilitate bonding of the bicomponent fibres 
together to form a matrix, like a hot melt adhesive, and the core component remaining 
intact as a fibre. Such a system is described by B. Marcher in "Tailor-made 
polypropylene and bicomponent fibres for the nonwovens industry" Tappi, December 
1991 p 103-107. The retention of the core component in the form of a fibre results in an 
absorbent web
