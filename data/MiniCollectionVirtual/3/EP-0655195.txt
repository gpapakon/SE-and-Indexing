<ABSTRACT>
A method for combatting vermin in warehouses and/or processing areas, and in particular for combatting vermin in the storage and/or processing of grain, rice, peas, flour of any kind, coffee, cocoa, seeds, cotton, concentrated feed, tobacco, etc. has the following processing steps: the material to be stored and treated is kept in a chamber (1) or processing chamber; the temperature of the chamber is set at a constant value in the range between 45 DEG C and 65 DEG C; the raised temperature of the chamber is maintained for a period of between 12 and 48 hours. A device for implementing the method in question has a chamber (1) for storing the material and/or a processing chamber for the processing of raw materials. According to the invention, there is provided a heating system (2), which heats the chamber (1) and/or the processing chamber and therefore the material and/or the raw materials. The temperature of the chamber is set at a constant value between 45 DEG C and 60 DEG C.
