<ABSTRACT>
An improvement in the process of transporting biological materials into living cells by bombarding the cells with microprojectile particles coated with biological material. In the improved process prior to coating of the particles such as tungsten beads for example, with biological material such as DNA, the particles are first pretreated with a strong inorganic acid such as nitric acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: PRETREATMENT OF MICROPROJECTI ES PRIOR TO USING IN A PARTICLE GUNBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to an improved process for transferring biological materials such as nucleic acid into the cytoplasm of living cells. With the rapid advancement of recombinant DNA technology, there is a wide-ranging need for biologists to transfer biologic substances from one cell to another, and to transfer synthetic biological material into living cells to exert their activity therein. Such materials can include biological stains, proteins (antibodies or enzymes), and, most commonly, nucleic acids genetic material (either RNA or DNA). Most of the techniques used are painstakingly slow and use methods which transport materials into, at most, only a few cells at a time. More recently, there has been developed a particle bombardment process which utilizes a particle gun, as described in Sanford, et al., 1987, "Delivery of Substances Into Cells and Tissues Using A Particle Bombardment Process, " Journal of Particle Science and Technology 5:27-37, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.An earlier invention of one of the joint inventors, Dwight Tomes, relates to an improved 

 particle gun which uses a gun having a rifled barrel. The disclosure of particle gun bombardment and the method of transport of biological materials such as DNA into living cells as described in Tomes, IMPROVED PARTICLE GUN, filed May 12, 1989, Serial No. 07/351,075, is incorporated herein by reference.The effectiveness of particle transport is, of course, measured by the ability of living cells into which the transported particles have been inserted to pick up and express the biological material. This, of course, depends upon a wide variety of conditions. The less the expression, the less successful the transport. Correspondingly, the more successful the expression of the living cells, i.e. the extent that they pick up and express the transported biological material, the better the nucleic acid insertion experiments.In the particle gun technique the biological material (DNA for example) is mixed with the carrier. The carrier generally is comprised of a substantially inert metal in the form of small beads which function as microprojectiles. Generally, the microprojectiles have a diameter within the range of about 1 micron to about 4 microns. These beads can be made from tungsten, palladium, platinum or gold or an alloy 

 thereof. Tungsten is preferred for reasons of economics. However, tungsten
