<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transcoder (MTRA) in the land system 
of a mobile radio communication system, intended for coding/decoding 

of information between a pulse code modulated form (PCM) 
and a more compact pulse code modulated form (CPCM) suitable for 

radio transmission. The invention is characterized by a plurality 
of means (DSP1-DSP6; DSP7-DSP9) for coding/decoding of a 

predetermined number of traffic channels, each of said means 
performing a different operation of said coding/decoding, and 

each means, after having performed its specific operation on one 
traffic channel, performing the same operation on another traffic 

channel, whereby a plurality of traffic channels can be coded/decoded 
simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transcoder 
for a mobile radio communication system. In mobile radio communication systems it is known to use a so 
called transcoder for coding/decoding of information between a 
pulse code modulated form and more compact pulse code modulated 
form suitable for radio transmission. Such transcoder equipment 
is provided in the land system of the radio communication system. 
From GB-A-2 174 571 and US-A-4 777 633 it is 
previously known to provide each traffic channel with its own 
transcoder in the land system. This transcoder usually is located 
in or in connection to one of the base stations of the land 
system. This is a costly solution since all traffic channels 
seldom are simultaneously occupied and expensive transcoder 
equipment thus is not utilized during long time periods. Recently it has also been suggested to move the transcoder 
equipment from the base station to the mobile services switching 
centre in order to reduce the transfer rate between the base 
station and the mobile services switching centre to the lower 
transfer rate that is obtained in the radio connection due to the 
more compact pulse code modulated form of the signal. An object of the present invention is to provide a transcoder 
that is capable of processing several traffic channels simultaneously. 
Such an apparatus could be called a multi transcoder. This object is achieved by a transcoder 
with the characterizing features of claim 1.  The invention, further objects and advantages obtained by the 
invention are best understood by reference to the following 
description and the accompanying drawings, in which:  Figure 1shows the structure of a transcoder designed in 
accordance with the present invention; Figure 2shows the format of a time division pulse code 
modulated signal; and Figure 3shows the format of the compressed pulse code 
modulated signal. Throughout the Figures the same reference designations are used 
for corresponding elements.  Figure 1 shows an embodiment of a transcoder designed in 
accordance with the present invention. The transcoder in Figure 1 will be described with reference to 
the GSM standard, but the principles are also applicable for 
other standards, e.g. the American standard IS-54. In the European PCM-standard a transmission link transfers 2048 
Mb/s distributed over 32 channels, of which 30 are speech 
channels, see Figure 2. Each speech channel transfers 64 kb/s in 
each direction, which corresponds to a speech connection in the 
public telephone net.
