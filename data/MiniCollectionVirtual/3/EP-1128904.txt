<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are highly activated carbon particles derived from caustic digestion of rice hull ash obtained from thermal pyrolysis of rice hulls having an iodine number of at least 650 to 1000. The activated carbon pores are free of silicate residue from the caustic digestion. Also disclosed are methods of removing the silicate residue from the caustic silicate solution during digestion effective to substantially improve the activation of the carbon particles to commercial grade.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGHLY ACTIVATED CARBON FROM CAUSTIC DIGESTION OFRICE HULL ASH AND METHODField of the InventionThe present invention relates to highly activated carbon and its production from rice hull ash. Background of the InventionActivated carbons are adsorbents derived from carbonaceous raw materials in which thermal or chemical methods are used to remove most of the volatile non-carbon constituents and a portion of the original carbon content. This yields a structure with high porosity and surface area typically in the range of 600 to 1200 square meters per gram (m2/g) . The surface area is usually measured by the BET (Brunauer, Emmett, Teller) adsorption of nitrogen (N2) on the surface which correlates closely with the absolute values obtained in an iodine number test (ASTM D4607, "Standard Test Method of Iodine Number of Activated Carbon").Activated carbons can be produced from various raw materials, each of which will provide some differences in physical and adsorptive properties of the finished product. The most widely used materials in the commercial manufacture of activated carbons are: wood, coconut shells, peat, lignite, bituminous and anthracite coals, petroleum cokes, and synthetic polymers. Reactivation or regeneration of commercial activated carbons are normally required when they are considered to be "spent" and have reached their maximum adsorption. This is accomplished by thermal or chemical means depending on the type of adsorbate in the carbon. Some attempts have been made to produce activated carbons of commercial grade from agricultural wastes, including rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, and the hulls of soybeans, cottonseed, rice and peanuts; but to the applicants' 

knowledge, these attempts were unsuccessful and commercial grade highly activated carbon has never been produced from them or from rice hulls or rice hull ash prior to the present invention. As described in U.S. Patent No. 5,714,000, activated carbon is generated in quantities ranging from 3 percent to as much as 40 percent by weight in rice hull ash depending on the type of combustion or gasification process (thermal pyrolysis) utilized to burn rice hulls. During the caustic digestion of rice hull ash to produce a caustic silicate solution, the amorphous silica reacts with the alkaline element and becomes a soluble compound in the silicate solution. The activated carbon remains an inert material and becomes a suspended solid in the silicate solution. Some of the carbon pores become restricted by the silicate solution which must be
