<ABSTRACT>
The relative height between two sets of magnetic head 
groups AT,BT shared for recording and reproduction and 

mounted on actuators 100A, 100B is adjusted at high 
accuracy, so that a track of a predetermined track width 

and track pitch can be formed. In a rotary head type 
magnetic recording/reproduction apparatus including two 

sets of magnetic head groups AT and BT of one or a 
plurality of magnetic heads displaceable in the track 

width direction by actuators 100A and 100B, a signal which 
becomes the reference for relative height adjustment of 

the heads is recorded by one of the magnetic head groups. 
Then, the magnetic tape is rewound, and the run of the 

magnetic tape is controlled by one of the magnetic head 
groups. Under this state, the relative height between the 

two sets of magnetic head groups is detected by the other 
magnetic head group, whereby the relative height of the 

two sets of magnetic head groups is adjusted according to 
that information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for adjusting the relative height between two
sets of magnetic head groups mounted on actuators in a
rotary head type magnetic recording/reproduction apparatus
in accordance with the precharacterizing parts of the
independent method claims 1 and 2 and the independent
apparatus claims 18 and 24, respectively. Such a method and
apparatus are respectively known from Abstract of JP-A-56148723.
An apparatus of this kind may be a helical scan
video tape recorder (VTR).In recent years, there have been efforts to
significantly increase the density of recorded information
in a magnetic recording/reproduction apparatus, resulting
in reduction of the track width. For example, the track
width is 5µm in a LP mode of a home use digital VTR. Such
reduction of the track width causes strict conditions on a
magnetic head to carry out a satisfactory tracking
operation. More specifically, when a signal is to be
reproduced from a track having the width reduced in a
conventional type of magnetic recording/reproduction 
apparatus having the magnetic head fixed to the rotary
drum so that the magnetic head cannot move in the
direction of the track width, deviation occurs in the
tracking of the magnetic head, so that a sufficient
reproduced output cannot be obtained from the magnetic
head.This deviation in tracking is considered to be caused
by the so-called track bent that occurs during recording.
Because this track bent is inherent in each magnetic
recording/reproduction apparatus, deviation in tracking
caused therefrom becomes too great to be neglected
particularly when the relevant track is reproduced by a
magnetic recording/reproduction apparatus different from
that used for recording.In view of the foregoing, a magnetic
recording/reproduction apparatus is disclosed in, for
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,237,399. According to this
magnetic recording/reproduction apparatus including a
dynamic tracking system, a magnetic head displaceable in
the track width direction by an actuator such as of
piezoelectric elements is used. The relative position
error of a magnetic head with respect to a track on a
magnetic tape is detected on the basis of a signal
reproduced from the magnetic head, whereby the position of
the magnetic head in the track width direction is 
controlled by a closed loop according to the detected
relative position error.There are various methods of detecting a relative
position error signal of a head with respect to a track on
a magnetic tape during
