<ABSTRACT>
Portable satellite communication equipment 
includes a transponder unit (12) for transmission and 

reception, and an antenna portion (14) which is 
electrically coupled to the transponder, the antenna 

portion having first and second common flat antennae (14A, 
14B). The first and the second common flat antennae are 

common to both transmission and reception. The antennae 
are foldably coupled to each other by a hinge (16), and to 

the transponder unit (12) by another hinge (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to portable satellite
communication equipment.In the last few years, portable satellite
communication equipment which has a parabolic or a flat
antenna has been introduced to the market.It is required that such portable satellite
communication equipment is small in size and light in
weight. In this connection, portable satellite
communication equipment having a flat antenna was easier
to transport and beneficial to users.To increase the portability of such equipment,
portable satellite communication equipment using several
flat antennae that could be folded up for transportation
has been proposed. An example of such a conventional
portable satellite communication equipment is disclosed in
Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. Sho 63-174431,
namely, 174431/1988.This portable satellite communication equipment
comprises a flat reception antenna and a flat transmission
antenna which are foldably coupled to each other. As a
result, the portable satellite communication equipment
disclosed in the above-referenced application was smaller
in size than that having a parabolic antenna.EP-A-0508567 (Shaye Communications Limited) describes
an antenna system for a portable apparatus such as the
handset of a cordless telephone in which a flap is pivotally
connected to a main part of the housing and first and second
antennae are respectively mounted thereon. USA-A-4716576 (Kabushiki Kaisha Kenwood) describes
apparatus for controlling a transmitter-receiver which can
transmit and receive an aural signal and a data signal. In
the transmission mode, the control apparatus detects a data
transmission instruction of the transmitter-receiver and
changes to the mode in which the data signal is supplied to
the transmission unit of the transmitter, thereby executing
the data transmission. In the reception mode, the control
apparatus discerns that the signal received is the
transmission data to the transmitter-receiver and reduces
the output volume of the receiving unit, thereby allowing
the transmitter-receiver to receive the reception signal as
the data signal.USA-A-5247269 (France Telecom) describes a duplexer
for the simultaneous transmission and reception of
circularly polarized microwaves.GB-A-2240904 discloses a mobile facsimile system which
uses an automobile telephone as a transmission path. The
system uses an adaptor which can place the facsimile device
in an off-hook condition without using an ordinary telephone
set which is additionally provided to compensate for defects
of a portable-type

<CLAIMS>
A portable satellite communication equipment,

comprising:

a terminal (12) for transmission and reception;
an antenna portion (14) which is electrically coupled to said
terminal and which includes first and second common flat

antennae (14A, 14B), said first and second common flat antennae being
common to both said transmission and said reception and being

foldably coupled to each other; and
a primary hinge (16) in said antenna portion by which said
first and second common flat antennae are foldably coupled to

each other; characterized in that:
the equipment further comprises:
a distributor (113) which distributes a microwave transmission
signal to said first and second common flat antennae,

respectively, and which mixes a microwave reception signal
received from said first and second common flat antennae,

respectively; and
a signal cable (115) which connects said distributor to each
of said first and second common flat antennae;
said distributor and said signal cable being contained
in said primary hinge.
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
in claim 1, said terminal being supplied with a voice or a

facsimile signal from a telephone or a fax (101) and producing a
decoded baseband reception signal towards said telephone or

said fax, said antenna portion transmitting a microwave
transmission radio signal and receiving a microwave reception

radio signal,

said terminal including:
an interface (103) for connecting said telephone or said fax
with said terminal; 
a baseband processing portion (105) which is connected to said
interface and which codes said voice or said facsimile signal

into a coded baseband transmission signal and decodes a
converted baseband reception signal into said voice or said

facsimile signal;
a transmission signal processing portion (107) which converts
said coded baseband transmission signal into a converted

microwave transmission signal;
a reception signal processing portion (109) which converts a
filtered microwave reception signal into said converted

baseband reception signal; and
a duplexer (111) which selectively filters said converted
microwave transmission signal and a mixed microwave reception

signal into a filtered microwave transmission signal and said
filtered microwave reception signal.
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
in claim 2, wherein said signal cable in said primary hinge in

said antenna portion connects said duplexer with said first
and said second common flat antennae through said distributor.
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
in claim 3, each of said first and said second common flat

antennae having a front surface (14a, 14b) and a plurality of antenna
elements arranged on said front surface, wherein said first

and said second common flat antennae are folded to keep said
front surfaces opposed to each other on folding.
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
claim 4, said antenna portion having a back surface (14c), wherein

said terminal is united with said antenna portion in the side
of said back surface. 
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
in claim 4, wherein said antenna portion is also foldably

connected to said terminal by said primary hinge.
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
in claim 4, wherein said terminal has a secondary hinge (18), said

antenna portion being foldably connected to said terminal by
said secondary hinge.
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
in claim 7, wherein said primary hinge and said secondary

hinge are substantially perpendicular to each other.
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
in claim 7, wherein said primary hinge and said secondary

hinge are substantially parallel to each other.
A portable satellite communication equipment as claimed
in claim 1, further comprising a cover (117) which covers said

distributor and said signal cable contained in said primary
hinge, and thereby removal of said cover providing access to

said distributor and signal cable.
