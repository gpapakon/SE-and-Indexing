An internal vibrator (10), in particular for still unhardened concrete,
comprising:


a vibrator pipe (12) and a transverse pipe (16) attached
transversely to the vibrator pipe in the region of a bottom end

(14) of the vibrator pipe (12), wherein a vibrator drive (42) and
an imbalance (72, 74) driven by the vibrator drive (42) are

disposed in the transverse pipe (16), and wherein further a
substantially annular lateral projection (86) extending away from

the transverse pipe (16) is disposed in a central region (40) of the
transverse pipe (16),
characterized in

that a circumferential flange (88) is disposed in the region of the bottom
end (14) at the vibrator pipe (12), against which circumferential flange

rests an endface (90) of the lateral projection (86) in the assembled
state of the internal vibrator (10), that the transverse pipe (16) is

retained at the vibrator pipe (12) by means of threaded bolts (92)
penetrating the circumferential flange (88), and that a segment (96) of

the vibrator pipe (12) formed between the bottom end (14) of the
vibrator pipe (12) and the circumferential flange (88) protrudes into an

aperture (87) formed in the lateral projection (86), with the external
diameter of the segment (96) being only slightly smaller than the

internal diameter of the aperture (87). 
The internal vibrator according to claim 1,

characterized in that

the vibrator drive (42) is an electric motor having a stator (44, 50, 52)
disposed substantially in the central region (40) of the transverse pipe

(16), and a rotor (54) rigidly connected with a motor shaft (62) and
surrounded by the stator (44, 50, 52).
The internal vibrator according to claim 2,

characterized in that

the stator (44, 50, 52) comprises a stator core (44) and at least one
stator winding (50, 52), and is disposed to rest with its entire external

circumferential surface (46) against the transverse pipe (16).
The internal vibrator according to claim 2 or 3,

characterized in that

the motor shaft (62) extends substantially to an equal extent on both
sides of the rotor (54) and is disposed parallel to the transverse pipe

(16) such that the ends (68, 70) of the motor shaft (62) lie substantially
in the region of the ends (78, 80) of the transverse pipe (16).
The internal vibrator according to claim 4,

characterized in that

the motor shaft (62) is supported in the transverse pipe on both sides
of the rotor (54).
The internal vibrator according to claim 4 or 5,

characterized in that

the imbalance (72, 74) is divided, with one part (72, 74) of the
imbalance (72, 74) being disposed at each end of the motor shaft (54). 
The internal vibrator according to claim 6,

characterized in that

each part (72, 74) of the imbalance comprises a plurality of individual
imbalance elements (76) which, for selective variation of the imbalance

angle and/or the imbalance mass, are disposed at the respective end
(68, 70) of the motor shaft (62) to be angularly adjustable and

removable, respectively.
The internal vibrator according to any of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that

removable, preferably unscrewable sealing caps (82, 84) are disposed
at the respective ends (78, 80) of the transverse pipe (16).
The internal vibrator according to any of claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that

in the transverse pipe (16) there is provided a lateral aperture (89)
which substantially coincides with the aperture (87) of the annular

projection (86).
The internal vibrator according to claim 9,

characterized in that

a current supply line (24) runs through the vibrator pipe (12) and the
lateral aperture (89) in the transverse pipe (16).
The internal vibrator according to claim 10,

characterized in that

recesses (98) are provided in the external circumferential surface (46)
of the stator (44) for guiding current-carrying lines (25) to the

respective stator windings (50, 52). 
The internal vibrator according to claim 10,

characterized in that

recesses are provided in the internal circumferential surface of the
transverse pipe for guiding current-carrying lines to the respective stator

windings.
The internal vibrator according to any of claims 10 to 12,

characterized in that

the current-carrying lines (25) are connected by a plug-in connection
with the current supply line (24) running through the vibrator pipe (12).
The internal vibrator according to claim 13,

characterized in that

the part of the plug-in connection connected with the current supply
line (24) is disposed at the bottom end (14) of the vibrator pipe (12),

and that the part of the plug-in connection connected with the current-carrying
lines is disposed at the transverse pipe (16) in the region of the

lateral aperture (89) such that the plug-in connection is automatically

established when attaching the transverse pipe (16) to the vibrator pipe
(12).
