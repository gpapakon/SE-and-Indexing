<ABSTRACT>
Combinations of materials in composite form, which are thermoadhesive to themselves by treatment at temperatures not exceeding 90  C and which can be shaped in the form of a laminate at said temperature, are characterized in that they comprise a first rubber-like elastoviscous constituent having a softening point not exceeding 90  C and a second, semicristalline constituent essentially of polyester type having a fusion temperature from 35 to 80  C. These combinations have controlled adhesiveness and adequate fluidity for easy application by hand, particularly in do-it-yourself applications, orthopedics, sport and physiotherapy.

A composite combination of materials in sheets, wound 
strips or plaques, offering uniformly distributed openings of 

size from 1 to 12 mm, leaving a free passage of at least 40 
per-cent of the total surface, formable and adhesive to 

themselves at a temperature in the temperature interval from 
35°C to 90°C, and combining an open mesh textile substrate 

with specific weight not exceeding 500 g per square meter, 
whose body is successively impregnated or coated, then 

impregnated again and completely covered with at least two 
distinct materials, the first one, inside or on the surface 

of the substrate being of the group of amorphous or semi 
crystalline polymers, copolymers or alloys having a softening 

temperature not exceeding 80°C and showing above that 
softening temperature a viscoelastic to rubbery but non fluid 

behaviour, and the last one at the outer surface of the first 
ones, being of the group of semi crystalline polymers, 

copolymers or alloys with a content of aliphatic ester type 
structural units of at least !à per-cent and having a melting 

temperature comprised between 35 and 80°C and having during a 
certain time after the fusion an adhesive character on itself 

in a way the combination can be laminated in 2 or more 
layers. 
A combination according to claim 1, wherein the substrate 
is a woven or non woven fabric with openings from 1 to 12 mm 

and wherein all the materials are applied prior to 
perforation or expansion. 
The combination according to claim 1 wherein the first 
material is in weight proportion of 10 to 90 percent, 

preferably of 20 to 80 percent and the second in weight 
proportion of 90 to 10 percent, preferably of 80 to 20 

percent, among themselves, the substrate weight being from 5 
to 50 percent that of the whole combination. 
A combination according to claim 1 wherein the first 
material is selected among the group a vinyl polymer or  

 
copolymer, a polymer or copolymer of acrylic or methacrylic 

ester, a polymer or copolymer of butadiene, chloroprene or 
isoprene, a copolymer of styrene, acrylonitrile and 

butadiene, chloroprene or isoprene, a copolymer of ethylene 
and acrylic, methacrylic or vinyl ester, a thermoplastic 

polyurethane, a polyurethane or a polyurea. 
A combination according to claim 1 wherein the first 
material is a branched or partially or totally cross linked 

polymer and comprises in proportion larger than 50 percent 
the structural unit of crystallizable aliphatic polyesters. 
A process allowing to obtain the combination according to 
claim 4 or 5 wherein the first material is in whole or in 

part applied onto the substrate by laying or impregnation 
with or without a solvent, of a monomer or macromer reactive 

composition which is transformed in said material in the 
presence of the substrate, said eventual solvent is 

evaporated. 
A process allowing to obtain the combination according to 
claim 4 or 5 wherein the first material is in whole or in 

part applied onto the substrate by laying or impregnation of 
a polymer latex followed by the evaporation of the water at a 

temperature that allows the coalescence of the polymer 
particles. 
A thermoadhesive and thermomouldable structural material 
for successive lamination having a composition according to 

one of claims 1 to 5. 
A three dimensional decorative element based on material 
according to claim 8. 
A laminated part for single use framing in the moulding 
of reinforced polyester resins, based on material according 

to one of claims 1 to 5. 
A rigid or flexible bandage made by circular lamination 
after temperature treatment of a strip material according to 

one of claims 1 to 5.  
 
A supporting or immobilisation device obtained by 
lamination at temperature of a sheet or plaque material 

according to one of claims 1 to 5.
