<ABSTRACT>
The present invention encompasses a method for 
providing the same ohmic material contact (120, 122, 124) 

to N-type and P-type regions (70, 80) of a III-V 
semiconductor device. Specifically, an N-type region 

(70) extending through a semiconductor structure is 
formed. Additionally, a P-type region (80) extending 

through the substrate is formed. The P-type region (80) 
may be heavily doped with P-type impurities (81). A 

first ohmic region (117) is formed, contacting the N-type 
region (70). The first ohmic region may comprise an 

ohmic material including metal and an N-type dopant. A 

second ohmic region (119) is formed, contacting the P-type 
region (80, 81). The second ohmic region comprises 

the same ohmic material as the first ohmic region. One 
ohmic material that may be used is nickel-germanium-tungsten.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to ohmic
contacts, and more particularly, to ohmic contacts used
for semiconductor devices.Complementary semiconductor devices, and
specifically III-V complementary heterostructure field
effect transistors (CHFETs) or complementary
heterostructure insulated gate field effect transistors
(CHIGFETs) have been shown to be extremely useful for low
power, low voltage and high speed applications. See, for
example, "Low Power AlGaAs/GaAs Complementary FETs
Incorporating InGaAs N-channel Gates," Abrokwah,
US-A- 4 729 000 and "High Transconductance
Complementary (Al, Ga) As/GaAs Heterostructure Insulated
Gate Field-Effect Transistors," Abrokwah et al,
US-A- 4 814 851. The prior art discloses
complementary gallium arsenide (GaAs) heterostructure
devices using self-aligned ion implantation technology.
CHIGFETs are CMOS-like devices using a wide bandgap
insulator, such as aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) or
aluminum indium arsenide (AlInAs) to confine high
mobility two-dimensional electron or hole gases in the 
channel, for carrier transport. The two-dimensional
gases are formed close to the heterojunction of the wide
bandgap material insulator and the narrow bandgap
material channel. A typical channel material is
pseudomorphic InxGa1-xAs. The prior art, however,
exhibits several drawbacks with respect to the ohmic
contact metallization employed for electrically
contacting the active regions of the devices.The complementary nature of the devices of course
implies that they include both N-type and P-type devices
on the same substrate. The typical ohmic metallization
of the prior art is different for N-type and P-type
devices. For N-type, gold germanium nickel (AuGeNi) has
been used. For P-type, gold zinc nickel (AuZnNi) or gold
zinc gold (AuZnAu) has been used, for example see "P- and
N-Channel InAlAs/InGaAs Heterojunction Insulated Gate
FETs (HIGFETs) on InP" written by Swirhun et al. and
published from the 3rd International Conference on Indium
Phosphide and Related Materials held in Cardiff, UK
during April 8-11, 1991. Both ohmic contacts rely on Au
metallization for low resistance, resulting in several
disadvantages. The Au-based ohmics are not etchable.
Consequently, they must be defined on the device by a
lift-off process. As is well understood in the art,
lift-off is associated with relatively poor yields and
poor pattern definition, and thus limits device
geometries to relatively large dimensions. The large
dimensions decrease the maximum number of devices which
