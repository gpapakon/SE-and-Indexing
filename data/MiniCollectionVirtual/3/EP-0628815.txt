Device for determining the Wobbe index of a 
first gas mixture, comprising a mixing chamber, means for 

supplying the first gas mixture to the mixing chamber via 
a first number of openings, means for supplying an oxidation 

gas to the mixing chamber via a second number of 
openings, means for keeping a constant ratio between the 

quantity of first gas mixture and the quantity of oxidation 
gas supplied to the mixing chamber, means for burning 

the second gas mixture formed in the mixing chamber and 
means for determining the oxygen content of the combustion 

gas obtained after combustion, in which the ratio of the 
diameters of the openings for the supply of the first gas 

mixture and the oxidation gas to the mixing chamber is 
chosen such that the Reynolds numbers of the flows of 

first gas mixture and oxidation gas through the openings 
are equal, and that the number of openings is determined 

by the desired ratio of the flow rates of first gas mixture 
and oxidation gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for determining
the Wobbe index of a first gas mixture, comprising a
mixing chamber, means for supplying the gas mixture to the
mixing chamber via a first number of openings, means for
supplying an oxidation gas to the mixing chamber via a
second number of openings, means for keeping a constant
ratio between the quantity of first gas mixture and the
quantity of oxidation gas supplied to the mixing chamber,
means for burning the second gas mixture formed in the
mixing chamber, and means for determining the oxygen
content of the flue gas obtained after combustion.For the determination of the Wobbe index of gas
mixtures various types of devices are known. A number of
them are described in Dutch patent applications 8802336,
8901660 and 9000449.With these known devices, the first gas mixture
of which the Wobbe index must be determined is mixed with
an oxidation gas such as air. This mixing takes place in a
mixing chamber which is connected on the one hand to a
supply of the first gas mixture and on the other hand to a
supply of an oxidation gas such as air. It is attempted to
obtain and maintain a constant ratio between the
quantities of supplied first gas mixture and oxidation
gas. The obtained second gas mixture is conveyed from the
mixing chamber to a combustion chamber where it is burned.
The oxygen content of the combustion gas obtained in this
way is determined. Use is made of a so-called lambda probe
for the determination of the oxygen content of the flue
gas. In general, this will be done using excess air.For the determination of the Wobbe index then 
various methods can be used. A first method involves
keeping the measured value of the oxygen content constant.
The signal from the lambda probe is then used to regulate
the supply of either the first gas mixture or of the
oxidation gas, so that the resulting oxygen content remains
constant. The Wobbe index can then be determined
through the set values of either the flow rate of the
first gas mixture or the flow rate of the oxidation gas.
This method ensures that the lambda probe is always used
in the same operating range so that, when provisions are
present for keeping the temperature constant, the characteristic
and particularly the ageing and consequently the
change in the characteristic of the lambda probe have no
influence on the measured value of the Wobbe index. With
other methods, the oxygen content measured by the lambda
probe is directly converted into a Wobbe index value.If the second method is used, it is
