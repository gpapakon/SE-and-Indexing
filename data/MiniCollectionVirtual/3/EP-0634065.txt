<ABSTRACT>
In a synchronous generator of brushless type where the field winding (2) of the rotor of the main device is fed via a co-rotating rectifier (8) from the rotor windings (4) in the rotor to a supply device on the same shaft, a damping resistance is put into the excitation current circuit, connected in parallel with a turn-off thyristor (10). With de-coupling of the excitation, the thyristor (10) is turned off by means of a turn-off pulse transmitted by means of a slip-ring arrangement (11, 12).

<DESCRIPTION>
A method and device for demagnetizing brushless synchronous machinesThe invention relates to a procedure according to the preamble of claim 1 and an arrangement according to the preamble of claim 5 respectively.A synchronous generator of the normal type can be seen as an assembly of a main device and a supply device. The main device has a three-phase-wound stator which supplies the output power, and a rotor with field windings which are supplied with an adjustable direct current. The supply device is a generator which is intended to produce current for the field windings of the main device's rotor. Presently the supply device is normally an alternating- current device. With non-brushless synchronous generators the alternating-current voltage from the supply device is rectified in a rectifier and the rectified current is fed to the main device's rotor via brushes.When semi-conductor rectifiers became available at a reasonable price in the 1960's it was considered suitable to have brushless synchronous generators, i.e. to have the field winding in the rotor supplied from the supply device's rotor with an intermediary co-rotating rectifier.This means that the main device's rotor can be supplied with direct current without using brushes in that a co- rotating rectifier rectifies its three-phase current and delivers it to the synchronous generator's rotor.The regulation of the synchronous generator occurs in brushless devices by the current coming from the supply device being regulated by acting on the current in its field winding which is of course stationary. In this way a 

brushless synchronous generator can in principle be regulated in a completely normal and known manner as far as concerns its normal power regulation of magnitude and phase.A particular regulation problem remains however which has up till now remained unsolved, namely the fast regulation of the main device's voltage down to zero. Clearly it is easy to regulate the current of the field winding down to zero by acting on the current of the field winding of the supply device so that the delivered armature e. .f. becomes zero. However, the magnetic energy then remains in the field winding of the synchronous generator and prevents a quick down-regulation process. If the load line of the synchronous device is then lightly loaded with an essentially capacitative load, even the voltage can rise momentarily which can be a great disadvantage. A serious voltage rise, particularly for the safety systems, can unnecessarily actuate error
