<ABSTRACT>
An electrodynamic device such as a electric motor has a stator (16) 
comprising a substrate (41) in the form of a sheet or foil carrying a plurality of 

windings (U₁-U₃, V₁-V₃, W₁-W₃) comprising spiral coils (43, 45) on its upper and its 
lower side connected in series with one another, which stator has a number of phases 

(U, V, W) each comprising at least one winding. The device in accordance with the 
invention may comprise one or a plurality of such substrates (41), but each substrate 

always carries all the phases (U, V, W) present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrodynamic device comprising: 
a movable permanent-magnetic member (rotor) is rotatable about an axis, and an electromagnetic stator comprising: a substrate such as a sheet or foil, a plurality of windings comprising spiral first and second coils which are electrically 
connected in series with one another via interconnections and which are situated, 
respectively, on the first and the opposite second side of the substrate, and a plurality of phases each comprising at least one winding,  
said substrate carrying all the phases, 
the windings comprising electrically conductive tracks on the substrate, the interconnections comprising at least one electrically conductive track, the coils are arranged uniformly around the axis in a regular pattern, the first and second coils substantially coincide in a projection parallel to the axis, the interconnecting tracks form regular patterns which are identical in plan views of 
the first and the second side of the substrate. As is common usage, "rotor" is to be understood to mean the moving 
member of the device. This implies that it need not be a rotating member although it 
may be such a member. Apart from being rotating the rotor may be translating or may 
perform a combined translation and rotation. The rotor may be disc-shaped or 
cylindrical. If the device forms an electric motor it may be of the axial-field type or the 
radial-field type. Such a device is known from CH-A-665 303. The known device 
comprises a permanent-magnetic rotor and a disk-like electromagnetic stator. The stator 
is formed by an isolating substrate carrying windings on both sides. Windings on 
different sides of the substrate are interconnected by interconnection tracks on either 
side of the substrate and a feedthrough connection connecting the interconnection tracks 
at different sides of the substrate. The interconnection tracks are situated adjacent the 
windings and take up a lot of space.  
 It is an object of the invention to provide a device of the type defined in 
the opening paragraph, which combines an effective use of the available space with a 
satisfactory stability of operation. To this end the invention is characterized in that each 
interconnecting track is situated on the first side for one half and on the second side for 
another half. A device according to the invention has some important advantages for 
small and flat electric motors, for example for use in magnetic disc storage units. Such 
a disc storage unit has already been
