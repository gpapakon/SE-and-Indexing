<DESCRIPTION>
Thermoplastic resins, as opposed to cross-linked
thermosetting resins, possess a tendency to cloud and
undergo discoloration under certain conditions. This
effect is caused in part by polymeric decomposition when
exposed to elevated temperatures, or contact with moisture
or oxygen. Among the many thermoplastic resins, molded and
extruded polycarbonate thermoplastics are in great demand
due to their high resiliency, resistance to attack by
chemical solvents, high heat stability, non-toxicity and
clear, colorless film forming properties, many of which
properties are lacking in thermosetting resins such as
those disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,917,555.High clarity and water-white color are
particularly important characteristics in polycarbonate
products which demand an exceptionally high degree of
colorless transparency. Further, polycarbonates of high
molecular weight are generally desired for hard, resilient,
transparent and colorless products such as bullet-proof
safety glass, street light lenses, bottles, automotive
light shields, kitchen appliances, safety glasses,
packaging films and others. Clear, colorless polycarbonate
sheets are particularly desirable in applications where
transmission of light is required, as in the lenses of
automotive headlights. Prior polycarbonate lenses have
tended to yellow with time. Accordingly, it has been the
aim of research to develop a polycarbonate with eliminates
or minimizes this disadvantage. In U.S. patent 4,431,673
there are disclosed certain cosmetic formulations
containing certain guerbet alcohol derived esters.
However, such cosmetic uses do not require colorless
transparency in the final product. Exceptional uniformity 
is also demanded for precision molded articles of high
molecular weight polycarbonate thermoplastics used in laser
read compact recording discs, microwave cookware and
containers for comestible or medical products.The thermoplastic moldable polycarbonates require
special care in processing since many difficulties which
are absent from thermosetting resins and which are unique
to these resins are encountered. Notable among the
difficulties in molding is the tendency of polycarbonates
to degradation (i.e. discoloration and generation of carbon
dioxide bubbles) in the presence of small amounts of water
or methyl alcohol. It is also known that atmospheric
oxygen is troublesome since it not only causes
discoloration but also induces cross-linking, a condition
to be avoided where resiliency and absence of color are
required (Encyclopedia of Chemical
