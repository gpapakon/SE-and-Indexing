Process for the preparation of an alkanesulphonic 
acid from the corresponding dialkyl disulphide, characterized 

in that it consists in submitting an alcoholic 
solution of the dialkyl disulphide containing no 

methylene blue as photosensitizer, in the presence of 
oxygen, to an irradiation by light rays of wavelength 

between 200 and 320 nm. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the alkyl 
radicals of the dialkyl disulphide are linear or branched 

alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 16, preferably from 
1 to 4 carbon atoms. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
solvent is a C
1
 to C
4
 alcohol, preferably methanol. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in 
which the dialkyl disulphide content of the starting 

alcoholic solution is between 0.1 and 90 % by weight, 
preferably between 1 and 25 %. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in 
which the procedure is carried out at a temperature 

between -20°C and the boiling point of the alcohol, 
preferably between 18 and 45°C. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in 
which the procedure is carried out at atmospheric pressure. 
Application of the process according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6 to the synthesis of methanesulphonic acid 

from dimethyl disulphide.
