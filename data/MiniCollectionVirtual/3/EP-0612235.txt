<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article such as a sanitary napkin having a liquid distribution strip that provides improved distribution or wicking of liquid exudates. The absorbent article comprises a liquid permeable topsheet, a liquid impermeable backsheet, a liquid absorbent pad and a liquid distribution strip. The absorbent pad is positioned between the topsheet and the backsheet. The liquid distribution strip is positioned between the topsheet and the absorbent pad. The liquid distribution strip comprises a nonwoven web which has a screen pattern having high fiber density portions with reduced spacing between the fibers and/or an embossed pattern having a higly compressed portion. The high fiber density portion of the screen pattern is oriented primarily to the longitudinal ends of the absorbent pad so as to distribute the liquid exuded to the longitudinal ends. The highly compressed portions of the embossed pattern are oriented primarily to the longitudinal ends so as to inhibit the distribution of liquid toward the lateral edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel absorbent article,
particularly to a sanitary article such as a sanitary napkin
or an absorbing sheet. As used herein, the term "absorbent
article" refers to devices which absorb and contain
body exudes, and, more specifically, refers to devices
which are placed against or in proximity to the body of
the wearer to absorb and contain the various liquid exudates
discharged from the body.All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured
for the absorption of body exuded (liquids or fluids)
such as menses, urine, and feces are, of course, known.
Generally, an absorbent article comprises a liquid pervious
topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet, and an
absorbent core or pad positioned between the topsheet
and the backsheet. The exudates from a wearer's body
readily penetrate through the topsheet and are contained
in the absorbent core. An additional layer or layers can
also be interposed between any of these layers. Such
additional layers can provide a rapid distribution of the
exudates.Such distribution layers improve wicking of exudates
over and into the absorbent core. There are several reasons
why the improved wicking of liquid exudates is
important, including providing a more even distribution
of the liquid exudates throughout the absorbent core and
allowing the absorbent article to be made relatively thin.
The wicking referred to herein can encompass the transportation
of liquids in one, two or all directions (i.e., in the
x-y plane and/or in the z-direction). The distribution layer
can comprise several different materials including non-woven
or woven webs of synthetic fibers. Several references
describe absorbent products having layers for
such purpose. Examples of sanitary napkins having an
acquisition layer and a topsheet are more fully described
in U.S. 4,950,264 issued to Osborn, and DE-A-4.024.053.However, there is need for a liquid distribution layer
having a high liquid diffusion rate in a longitudinal direction.
That is, the diffusion speed of nonwovens is generally
constant irrespective of direction. In WO-A-8.901.325
and in EF-A-0.291.316 there is described a
liquid absorbent pad which is positioned between a liquid
permeable top sheet and a liquid impermeable backsheet
having a pattern which inhibits distribution of body
liquid towards the lateral edges of the article and encourages
distribution in a longitudinal direction. When non-woven
material in general is used as an absorbent core
cover sheet or as a topsheet in a sanitary napkin, a large
amount
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An absorbent article (1) having longitudinal edges and lateral edges, said absorbent
article comprising a liquid permeable topsheet (2), a liquid impermeable backsheet

(3), a liquid absorbent pad (4) for absorbing a liquid exuded from the human
body positioned therebetween and having longitudinal ends (6), and a

liquid distribution strip (10, 30) positioned between said topsheet and said absorbent
pad, said liquid distribution strip comprising a nonwoven web, 
characterized in that
 said nonwoven web has an embossed
pattern (15) which comprises discontinuous embossed lines oriented primarily in the longitudinal

direction wherein fibers are highly compressed into thin film segments so as to inhibit
the distribution of said body liquid through the embossed pattern toward said lateral

edges, the fibers being so compressed that subtantially all of the liquid must distribute around the embossed lines, and wherein said nonwoven web additionally comprises a screen pattern (13)
which comprises high fiber density portions (17) oriented primarily to said

longitudinal ends of said absorbent pad, the combination of the screen pattern (13)
and embossed pattern (15) providing superior liquid distribution in the longitudinal

direction because of good liquid diffusion rate in the longitudinal direction at the
screen pattern, and inhibiting liquid distribution in the lateral direction at the

embossed pattern (15).
The article of claim 1, wherein said screen pattern (13) comprises a continuous
pattern.
The article of claim 2, wherein said screen pattern comprises a lattice pattern (19)
having rhombuses (21), each rhombus having a long axis (23) and a short axis, said

long axis being oriented to said longitudinal ends of said absorbent pad.
The article of claim 2, wherein said screen pattern comprises plural parallel lines, or
plural lines each comprising repeated elements of a long line and a short line. 
The article of claim 3, wherein the discontinuous lines of said embossed pattern (15) are
located inside of said rhombus (21) of said lattice pattern of said screen pattern.
