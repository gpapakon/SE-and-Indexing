<ABSTRACT>
A connector apparatus (10) is disclosed for 
providing an interconnection between two IC packs (14,16) 

and a printed circuit board (18). A dual header connector 
(12) is mounted on the printed circuit board, into which 

the two IC packs are inserted and ejected. Two independent 
ejector units (34,36) each have a separate frame (40) to be 

attached to the header connector and a separate actuator 
(44,52) for moving a respective one of the IC packs from 

its inserted position to its ejected position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a connector 
apparatus for providing interconnection between two IC packs 
and a printed circuit board. A conventional connector apparatus for an IC pack 
or memory card is disclosed for example in document US-A-4,952,161 
and includes a generally U-shaped frame having a 
pair of guide grooves inside a pair of side frame portions, 
with a connector section joining or extending between the 
side frame portions. A planar IC pack is inserted into the 
apparatus within the side guide grooves. A transverse array 
of socket terminals at an edge of the IC pack electrically 
connect an associated array of pin terminals on the 
connector section. Such connector apparatus often are provided as 
header connectors used for interconnecting the semiconductor 
circuit of the IC pack to an external circuit such 
as a main electronic unit. The header connector may be used 
with an IC pack or memory card for removably coupling the IC 
pack to a printed circuit board. The IC pack is inserted 
into the header connector and is extracted therefrom as 
needed. The extraction force of the IC pack, i.e. the force 
between the respective terminal pins on the header connector 
and the respective socket terminals of the IC pack, is 
relatively high due to the tight fit required to obtain a 
good electrical interconnection between the terminals. 
These terminals typically are disposed at a high density 
which further increases the extraction forces. Often, when 
an IC pack is to be extracted from a header connector, the 
card is grasped by a user and simply pulled out. Consequently, a variety of ejecting mechanisms 
have been incorporated in various connector apparatus, such 
as the header connectors, for facilitating ejecting an IC 
pack from a header connector. Such ejecting mechanisms have 
been incorporated as integral or unitary devices fabricated  
 
as part of the connector apparatus or header connector, 
itself. On the other hand, separate ejecting mechanisms 
have been provided for assembly to the header connector, 
such as after the header connector has been coupled to a 
printed circuit board, for example the ejecting mechanism of 
US-A-4,952,161 which is constituted on a flat plate 
positioned together with an IC pack in separate guide 
grooves inside the above side frame portions. Still further, connector apparatus have been 
provided for interconnection between a plurality of IC packs 
and a main electronic unit, such as
