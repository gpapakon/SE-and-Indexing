<ABSTRACT>
A substrate (15) is secured to a casing (10) by 
means of a boss (11) having a shouldered base (12) and a 

smaller diameter spigot (13) with a tip (13a) provided 
with a blind hole (14) and passing thro
ugh aperture (16). 
Initial fixing is achieved by using a heated die (17) 

which melts and deforms tip (13a) into a head (18). For 
dismounting substrate (15) head (18) is cut-off. For 

remounting a self-tapping screw can be threaded into hole 
(14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a means for 
mounting a component or substrate to a base member being 
a plastic moulded product. Figure 10 and Figure 11 of the accompanying drawings 
show a typical prior art example of a method for mounting 
a component or substrate to a plastic moulded product. 
The method involves forming, by moulding, a head 7 to 
secure a component or substrate 4 to a boss 2. The boss 
2 is provided in advance with a small diameter spigot 
portion 3 formed on the top side. The boss 2 is 
connected at one side of a plastic moulded product 1 
during the moulding process and may be integral 
therewith. A mounting hole 5 is provided in the side of 
the component or substrate 4 into which the small 
diameter spigot 3 of the boss 2 locates. Heat for 
fusing the spigot 3 from the tip 3a is applied using a 
fusion die 6 for pressing and collapsing the spigot 3 at 
the same time. However, if the tip 3a of the spigot is pressed and 
collapsed as described above to achieve fixing then when 
the head 7 is cut off for dismounting the component or  
 
the substrate 4 or for replacing the part, the spigot 
cannot be melted and used again to fix the component to 
the boss in the same manner utilising the mounting hole 
5. Therefore, a prior art method has been adopted 
wherein a separate member of the same diameter is joined 
to the part of the spigot 3 remaining on the boss 2 and 
the spigot 3 is formed again after cutting off the spigot 
of the boss 2. This allows mounting of the component or 
substrate 4 in the same way as the first method. 
However, this method involves considerable work and 
cannot be carried out with ease. One of the objects of this invention is to provide a 
method wherein the component or the substrate can be 
secured again easily to the boss on a moulded product 
after dismounting. A further object of this invention is to provide a 
method whereby a component or a substrate can be easily 
secured to a boss on a moulded product during an original 
manufacturing procedure and wherein the connection can be 
broken (if the substrate or moulded part is damaged) and 
wherein a new part can be connected using the same boss 
on the moulded product. According to this invention there is provided a 
method of securing a component or substrate to a plastic  
 
product, the component or substrate having a mounting 
hole and the plastic product having a boss with a smaller 
diameter spigot formed on an upper end, the spigot being 
positioned in the said mounting hole of said
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of securing a component or substrate (15) 
to a plastic product (10), the component or substrate 

(15) having a mounting hole (16) and the plastic product 
(10) having a boss (11) with a smaller diameter spigot 

(13) formed on an upper end, the spigot (13) being 
positioned in the said mounting hole (16) of said 

component or substrate (15) with the tip (13a) protruding 
from an upper surface of said component or substrate 

(15), the tip being deformed by heat and pressure to form 
a head portion (18) having a diameter greater than said 

mounting hole (16) to secure the component or substrate 
(15) against a shouldered portion of the boss, 

characterised by the boss (11) including an axial hole 
(14) extending at least in part into said head portion 

(18). 
A method according to Claim 1 and for replacing or 
remounting the component or substrate (15), characterised 

by cutting off said head portion (18) to release said 
component or substrate (15) from said boss (11) and 

remounting said component or substrate (15) by 
positioning the remaining portion of the spigot (13) in 

said mounting hole (16) and screwing a self-tapping screw 
 

(20) into said axial hole (14) to secure said component 
or substrate (15) to said boss (11). 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised by 
the said hole (14) being a blind hole extending from the 

tip (13a) of the spigot (13) into the boss (11). 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised by 
the said hole (14) being a blind hole extending up 

through the boss (11) and terminating adjacent the tip 
(13a) of the spigot (13). 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised by 
the said hole (14) extending through the boss (11) and 

spigot (13).
