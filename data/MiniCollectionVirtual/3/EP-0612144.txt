<ABSTRACT>
In a power amplifier (5) circuit, deformed rises and 
overshoots in the waveform of an RF output signal (6) in the 

burst transmission mode are prevented by short-circuiting 
both ends of a capacitor (21) of a low-pass filter (10) with 

a switch (18) having a control terminal, before the start of 
transmission.
