<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises first cylinders (3a) provided 
along a first axis (Y), second cylinders (3b) 

provided along a second axis (Z), intake valves (6), one 
for each cylinder, a fuel manifold (7), supply pipes (8) 

which lead to the head of the respective cylinder, and 
injectors (11), one for each cylinder, in order to inject 

fuel along a respective supply pipe. The injectors 
comprise a nozzle (18) in which there is provided an 

injection hole (23) which is defined along an axis (B) 
which converges on the longitudinal axis (A) of the 

injector according to an angle (α). The axis of the 
injection hole of the injectors which supply the first 

cylinders converges on the intake valve of the first 
cylinders, whereas the axis of the injection hole of the 

injectors which supply the second cylinders converges on 
the intake valve of the second cylinders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel injection
system for a multi-cylinder thermic engine.As is known, the cylinders of multi-cylinder
endothermic engines may be subdivided into two rows. The
fuel injection system for these engines includes a fuel
manifold, a plurality of supply pipes (one per cylinder)
which originate from the fuel manifold and extend as far
as the respective cylinder, a plurality of injectors
suitable for injecting fuel along the respective supply
pipe towards the corresponding cylinder, and an air
intake manifold which has ducts which lead into the
supply pipes. Since the cylinders are subdivided into two
rows, the said supply pipes have a different length, a
first length for the cylinders which are closer to the
fuel manifold, and a second length for the cylinders
which are further from the fuel manifold. The fuel
manifold has a plurality of seats for the injectors,
these seats being distributed along a predetermined axis.
Owing to the difference in length of the supply pipes,
and since the injectors are mounted along the same axis,
the present system requires the fuel jet to be in line
with the longitudinal axis of the injectors, and the
latter to be oriented such that the fuel jet is directed
in a median direction between the straight line which
connects the injector and the cylinder which is closer to
the fuel manifold, and the straight line which connects
the injector and the cylinder which is further from the
fuel manifold. For this reason, the fuel jet strikes the
inner walls of the supply pipe.The above-described system has some disadvantages
caused by the fact that the fuel jet has a direction of
impact on the inner walls of the supply pipe such that
particles of fuel are deposited on these walls. In
transient conditions in particular, these deposits give
rise to problems in controlling the stoichiometry of the
air-fuel mixture, and concerning the quantity of fuel
conveyed to the cylinder. In addition, atomisation of the
fuel is less effective. In particular, accumulation of
particles of fuel on the walls distorts the stoichiometry 
of the mixture (which is controlled by an electronic
unit), since these particles of fuel can be mixed with
air in a cycle after that in which they have been
injected. Furthermore, if the particles of fuel deposited
on the walls of the supply pipe during the stage of
intake by the cylinder, remain on these walls, the
cylinder takes in a quantity of fuel which is less than
that actually injected by the injector. If these particles
which are
