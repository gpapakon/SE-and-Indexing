<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a building framework, comprising steel-made girders (5, 5') and steel-made, box-shaped columns (1, 1'). Girders (5, 5') comprise per se known internal girders of an slab assembly. The framework further includes box-shaped connecting members (12, 22, 32) for joining said columns (1, 1') and girders (5, 5') together for forming the building framework. The invention relates also to a method for the construction of said building framework.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a building framework as 
set forth in the preamble of claim 1. 
In 
particular, the invention relates to a steel-constructed 
framework of a multi-storey building. High quality of prefabricated elements manufactured in a 
favourable production environment and especially their 
dimensional accuracy is one of the most obvious benefits 
of a prefabricated steel framework. A steel framework 
requires highclass design work. On the other hand, the use 
of accurate building elements or components facilitates 
considerably erection of a building framework as well as 
other outfitting of a framework. However, the relative 
market share of building frameworks that are completely 
made of steel is quite modest. This is due to a number of 
problems associated with framework systems intended for 
industrial production. Swedish publication print SE 7113103 discloses a structure 
for connecting a plurality of horizontal girders to a 
column for producing a building framework. The top portion 
of a column of a square cross-section is provided with a 
square flange surrounding the column and holes for 
attachment. A horizontal girder of a U-shaped cross-section 
is placed on top of the column so that the flange 
of the girder and one side of the square flange of the 
column will be in register with each other. The slabs are 
supported on top of the girders, on the top edge of a 
girder. Thus, it is possible to place a total of four 
girders on top of a column in parallel to each side of the 
square. This type of solution involves several problems. 
It is necessary to place the horizontal girders on the  
 
edges of a column, which results in an asymmetric 
structure whenever the joint include less than four 
girders. Thus, the load of the girders on a column will be 
eccentric tending to bend the column. Also the attachment 
moments of girders on the support tend to distort the 
column. The girders in a joint do not create a functional 
unit but are each separately connected with a supporting 
column through the intermediary of a flange. Hence, each 
girder applies individually a load on that flange of a 
column to which it is attached. In case the number of 
girders is less than four, it is necessary to employ 
separate spacers mounted on those sides of a column flange 
having no horizontal girder. Neither is it possible to 
fill the columns with concrete, since the girders are 
detached from each other at the junction points. Due to an 
irregular and asymmetric disposition of the

<CLAIMS>
A building framework, comprising steel-made girders (5, 
5'), steel-made box-shaped columns (1, 1'), and steel-made 

box-shaped connecting members (12, 22, 32) by which said 
columns (1, 1') and girders (5, 5') are joined together 

for forming the building framework, said columns (1, 1'), 
girders (5, 5'), and connecting members (12, 22, 32) 

comprising essentially flat coupling elements (2, 9, 13, 
16) with openings (3, 7) for joining a connecting member 

(12, 22, 32) and a girder (5, 5') or a connecting member 
(12, 22, 32) and a column (1, 1') together, 
characterized
 
in that the columns (1, 1'), the girders (5, 5'), and the 

connecting members (12, 22, 32) are reinforced and filled 
with concrete such that the reinforcement extends through 

the connecting member (12, 22, 32) through said openings 
(3, 7), the girders (5, 5') being per se known internal 

girders of a slab assembly.

characterized
 in that the box-shaped connecting member 
(22) is formed at the end section of the internal girder 

(5, 5') of a slab assembly. 
A building framework as set forth in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the connecting member (32) is in the 
shape of a rectangular prism, whose horizontal and 

vertical sides form said coupling elements (13, 16) of the 
connecting member. 
A building framework as set forth in claim 3, 


characterized
 in that the vertical sides of the connecting 
member (32) are provided with three, preferably vertical, 

elliptically shaped concrete reinforcing and casting gates 
(7) of a girder.  

 
A building framework as set forth in claim 3, 

characterized
 in that the horizontal sides of the 
connecting member (32) are provided with a preferably 

square concrete reinforcing and casting gate (3) of a 
column. 
A building framework as set forth in claim 5, 

characterized
 in that the horizontal sides of the 
connecting member (32) are provided with preferably 

circular installation openings (4) for pipes or the like. 
A building framework as set forth in claim 3, 

characterized
 in that the connecting member (32) is open 
at both ends and accommodates two vertical, perforated 

support plates (26), placed in flush with the wall line of 
the column (1, 1') and extending parallel to the girder

A building framework as set forth in claim 4, 

characterized
 in that the coupling element (2) of a column
