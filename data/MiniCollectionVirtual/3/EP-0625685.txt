<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an electric arc furnace to melt
steel with alternative sources of energy and concerns also
the related operating method, as set forth in
claims 1 and 16 (EP-A-0 257 450).This invention is applied to the field of electric arc
furnaces employed to melt steel and alloys thereof and has
been conceived and designed to optimise the efficiency and
output of the plant by using alternative sources of energy
in a suitable manner.The invention is applied to furnaces working with direct
current and to furnaces working with alternating current.The furnaces to which the invention is applied may have a
tapping channel and a tapping hole without the positioning
of the tapping hole being in any way restricted.This is a typical preferred application for furnaces which
work with the method of the "pond", that is to say, with a
liquid heel always present.The invention has the purpose of achieving significant
savings of the energy consumed in feeding the furnace and of
the melting times.The invention is also particularly suitable for the
melting of completely cold charges.The invention is employed for charging the furnace with
scrap by means of skips, or for continuous charging of
scrap, or for continuous charging with pre-reduced material,
or for mixed charges.The methods of the state of the art for the melting of
metals include the process of injecting gaseous elements
into the furnace so as to accomplish a reaction of oxidation 
with the carbon and with the other oxidisable chemical
elements in the molten metallic mass.The oxidation reaction enables the intrinsic potential of
energy of the carbon and of the other chemical elements to
be recovered by means of an exothermic oxidation reaction.The gaseous elements injected may consist of air enriched
with oxygen or even of pure oxygen. These gaseous elements
may be blown onto the molten metal by means of lances
positioned above the surface of the bath and/or by nozzles
or tuyères placed on the bottom of the furnace.US-A-3,459,867 teaches the use of burners delivering
oxygen in carefully calculated quantities and therefore with
an excess of oxygen. These burners act along a
circumference positioned between the electrodes and the
sidewall of the furnace and work by following the movement
of the metal.US-A-2,909,422 teaches the delivery of oxygen and other
substances through a hollow electrode. The state of the art
therefore includes the injection of additives and powdered
coal through hollow electrodes placed in the roof of the
furnaces. These
