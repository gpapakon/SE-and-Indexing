<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an aniline derivative represented by general formula (3) by reacting a halogenated aminophenol 
derivative represented by general formula (1) or a carbonate derivative thereof with an alkylating agent of the formula (R-Y) in 

the presence of a phase-transfer catalyst in a bilayered system composed of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide and 
an organic solvent, wherein R represents (substituted) C₃-C₁₂ cycloalkyl or C₃-C₆ alkynyl; or a process for producing an aniline 

derivative represented by general formula (3) by reacting an aminophenol derivative represented by general formula (1) 
with an alkylating agent in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate in an organic solvent. The process enables an intermediate 

for producing an oxazolidinedione derivative useful as the active ingredient of a herbicide to be efficiently produced 
without the necessity for protecting the amino group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for producing
an aniline derivative of the general formula (3):
 
(where X1 and X2 represent a halogen atom and R represents
an optionally substituted cycloalkyl group having 3 - 12
carbon atoms or an optionally substituted alkynyl group
having 3 - 6 carbon atoms) by reacting a bis(amino-substituted
phenyl)carbonate derivative of the general
formula (4):

(where X1 and X2 represent a halogen atom)
with an alkylating agent of the general formula (2):
R - Y
(wherein R is as defined above and Y represents a leaving group)
in a two-layer system consisting of an aqueous
solution of an alkali metal hydroxide and an organic solvent
in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst.More specifically, this invention relates to
processes for the production of intermediates for the
manufacture of oxazolidinedione and tetrahydrophthalimide,
as well as tetrahydroindazole derivatives which are useful
as active ingredients of herbicides as described in
Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. Sho. 62-167713 or
Japanese Patent Public Disclosure Nos. Hei. 4-145071 and
Hei. 4-164067.The production of aniline derivatives of the general
formula (3) from halogen-substituted aminophenol derivatives
of the general formula (1) usually starts with aminophenol
derivatives in which the amino group suspected of doing harm
 
to the reaction is protected with a suitable protective
group and comprises the steps of alkylating the starting
material on the oxygen atom in the presence of a base and
thereafter removing the protective group. For instance,
as exemplified by Reaction Scheme (I) given below, phenol
(5) having the amino group protected as a carbamate group
is alkylated and the ester is then hydrolyzed under basic
conditions to produce an aniline derivative (see, for
example, Reference Examples in Japanese Patent Public
Disclosure Nos. Hei. 4-145071 and Hei. 4-164067) (see under
Reference Examples 1 and 2 to be described later in this
specification):
The production of aniline derivatives of the general
formula (3) from bis(amino-substituted phenyl)carbonate
derivatives of the general formula (4) usually starts
with aminophenol derivatives that are prepared by first
protecting with a suitable protective group the amino
group suspected of doing harm to the reaction and by then
hydrolyzing only the carbonate bond without impairing the
protective group and the production process comprises the 
steps of alkylating the starting material on the oxygen
atom in the presence of a base and thereafter removing
