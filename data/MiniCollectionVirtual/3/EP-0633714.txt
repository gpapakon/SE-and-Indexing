<ABSTRACT>
A processing apparatus using a fast atom beam which 
has at least one source selected from among a light energy 

source, a laser beam source, a radical source, an electron 
beam source, an X-ray or radiation (alpha rays, beta rays, 

or gamma rays) source, and an ion source, in addition to 
the fast atom beam source, so that an object to be processed 

which is disposed in a vacuum container or outside a vacuum 
is irradiated with a fast atom beam in combination with at 

least one selected from among the light energy, laser beam, 
electron beam, X-rays or radiation, radical particles and 

ion beam, to thereby increase processing speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a processing
apparatus which is designed to process an object by jointly
employing irradiation with a fast atom beam of atoms or
molecules having a relatively large kinetic energy and
irradiation with light energy, radical particles, ion beam,
laser beam, X-rays etc.Fig. 3 is a conceptual view showing a conventional
processing apparatus as known i.e. from J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 68, No. 6, 15 September 1989, pp 2613 - 2618 that uses a fast atom beam. As
illustrated in the figure, the conventional processing
apparatus has a vacuum container 2 and a fast atom beam
source 1 that releases a fast atom beam 3 into the vacuum
container 2 so that the fast atom beam 3 is applied to
an object 4 to be processed which is placed on a rotary
table 5 disposed in the vacuum container 2. The vacuum
container 2 has been evacuated by a turbo-molecular pump 7
or the like.In the processing apparatus having the above-described
arrangement, a gas which is highly reactive
with the object 4 to be processed is generally used as a
gas 6 for the fast atom beam 3 in order to increase the
processing speed. For example, chlorine gas is used for
processing GaAs. In addition, with a view to achieving
uniform processing, the object 4 is irradiated with the
fast atom beam 3 with the rotary table 5 being rotated.Advantageous features of the processing method
using a fast atom beam are as follows:
1) the directivity of the fast atom beam is
excellent; 2) it is possible to carry out processing under
high-vacuum conditions and, thus, collision rate between
the fast atom beam and other particles Is low and precise
processing is possible; and  3) since non-charged particle rays are used, it is
possible to process not only an electrically conductive
material but also an insulating material, which cannot
effectively be processed by an ion beam.However, the above-described conventional
processing apparatus using a fast atom beam suffers from
the problem that since the quantity of radical particles or
ion particles adsorbed on the surface of the object to be
processed is small in comparison to the plasma processing
technique, the processing speed is disadvantageously low.The paper "A Fast Atom Beam source with a Hollow Cathode",
published during the Eleventh Symposium on Ion Sources and Ion-Assisted
Technology, June 1st - 3rd 1987, pages 67 - 70
discusses a low energy fast atom beam source emitting fast
atoms at 100-500 eV.Attention is also drawn to US-A-5,108,543 which relates to a
method of surface treatment by
