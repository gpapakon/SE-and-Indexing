<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improvement to a so-called filtered-x active noise reduction system, in which a cyclic reference signal (x), generally synchronous with primary noise (p) to be cancelled, is applied to a control filter (6) that adaptively filters the reference signal (q) to drive an actuator (3) so as to produce secondary noise (s) for cancelling the primary noise. An error signal microphone (4) detects the residual (r) of the primary and secondary noise. A model filter (8) filters the reference signal (x) and has a filtering characteristic selected to model the transfer function for said secondary noise from the actuator through the microphone (4). An LMS controller (7) responsive to said filtered reference signal and the detected residual (r) adaptively controls the control filter (6) so as to tend to minimise the residual (r). The model filter (8) has its filtering characteristics selectible for different frequencies of the reference signal (x) and a sensor (14) is used to detect the operating frequency so that the filtering characteristic of the model filter can be selected in dependence upon the sensed frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for and a method
of cancelling phenomena such as noise.Hitherto, it has been appreciated that noise, for example,
from an engine, has a repetitive characteristic which
is a function of engine speed. Prior active
cancellation proposals have utilised a reference signal
based upon engine speed to generate a secondary signal
which can be used to cancel the primary engine noise.
In a so-called filtered-X system, a reference signal x
having a frequency corresponding to engine speed, is
filtered using an adaptive filter to produce the
secondary, cancelling signal. The adaptive filter
essentially comprises a series of delay elements each
with an individual weighting, having their outputs
connected together to form a transversal filter, the 
weighting characteristics of each delay element being
adjustable by the use of a least mean squares
algorithm, (LMS), for example as disclosed by B.
Widrow and S.D. Stearns in "Adaptive Signal Processing"
Prentice Hall 1985. The LMS algorithm is performed in
accordance with the value of an error signal detected
by a microphone, representative of the residual
occurring after cancellation of the primary by the
secondary signal. The secondary signal is typically
produced by a loudspeaker or actuator connected to the
output of the adaptive filter.This prior system tended to be unstable since there was
no compensation for the transfer function presented to
the secondary signal between the actuator and the error
detecting microphone. In order to overcome the
problem, a so-called modelling filter has been included
in the input to the adaptive control filter in order to
improve stability.A problem with the prior filtered-X system is that it
assumes that the transfer function between the actuator
and error sensing microphone is constant in all 
circumstances. In practice, the transfer function may
vary for example as a function of engine speed or some
other operating condition. As a result, the filter
characteristics for the model filter may not accurately
reflect the actual transfer function and consequently,
system instabilities can arise.With a view to overcoming this problem the present
invention provides in a first aspect, apparatus for
cancelling primary phenomena, such as noise, that are generally
synchronous with a cyclic reference signal, comprising:
control filter means for adaptively filtering the
reference signal to produce a secondary signal;
actuator means responsive to the secondary signal to
produce secondary phenomena for
