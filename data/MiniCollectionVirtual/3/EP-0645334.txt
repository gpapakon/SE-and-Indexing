<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a folding apparatus with devices for cross folding and stapling of printed products, having in each case a point or gripper folding blade cylinder and a folding jaw cylinder (6) for the first and second cross folds, and having a stapling device (5) for one of the cross folds. In order to enable printed products, which have been cross folded once or twice, have optionally been stapled additionally in one of the cross folds and can be delivered directly after the first cross fold, to be produced by a favourable modular design without limiting the processing speed, a separate stapling cylider (5) is optionally arranged on the point folding blade cylinder and the gripper folding blade cylinder, and the printed products are passed on by the folding jaw cylinder (6) for the first cross fold either, optionally stapled, into a delivery (12) or unstapled via a belt conveying system (8) to the gripper folding blade cylinder, or a stapling device comprising in each case a stapling cylinder and a staple closing cylinder is optionally arranged in the path and in the region of the belt conveying system which conveys printed products.

<CLAIMS>
Folding apparatus having devices for cross-folding 
and stapling printed products, respectively having a 

needle-type and a gripper-type folding-blade cylinder 
(2; 15; 15') and a folding-jaw cylinder (6; 14) for the 

first and the second cross fold, and a stapling device 
(5) for the first cross fold on the needle folding 

blade cylinder (2), a delivery unit (12) for the 
printed products being arranged on the folding-jaw 

cylinder (6) for the first cross fold, characterised in 
that a conveyor belt system (8; 47) conveying the 

printed products to the gripper-type folding-blade 
cylinder (15; 15') of the second cross fold is arranged 

with a pivotable guide tongue (7) which makes it 
possible to discharge the printed product into the 

conveyor belt system (8; 47), and the folding apparatus 
is equipped with a further stapling device (13; 13'; 

48; 49) for the second cross fold. 
Folding apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that arranged in the conveyor belt 

system (47) is a stapling cylinder (49) co-operating 
with a staple-closing cylinder (48). 
Folding apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that arranged on the gripper-type 

folding-blade cylinder (15; 15') is a stapling cylinder 
(13; 13') cooperating with it. 
Folding apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the stapling cylinder (13; 13') 

is mounted to be pivotable away from the gripper-type 
folding-blade cylinder (15; 15').  

 
Folding apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the stapling cylinder (13) is 

mounted with its axle journal (20; 21) on both sides 
respectively in a lever (22; 23), both levers (22; 23) 

being secured on a shaft (25) mounted pivotably in the 
frame (24; 24'), in addition one half of a coupling 

(26) being secured on one axle journal (21) and, in the 
operating position of the stapling cylinder (46; 13), 

engaging with a cam (27) in form-fitting manner into a 
radial recess (28), open on the circumferential side, 

of the other coupling half (29) which has an axle 
journal (30) mounted rotatably in the frame (24'), on 

which journal a spur gear (33) is located, in 
engagement with a drive wheel (32) secured fixedly on 

an axle journal (31) of the gripper-type folding-blade 
cylinder (15). 
Folding apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the stapling cylinder (13') is 

mounted with its axle journal (20'; 21') on both sides 
respectively in a lever (22'; 23'), both levers (22'; 

23') being secured on a shaft (25') mounted pivotably 
in the frame (24; 24'), in addition a gear wheel (35) 

being secured on one axle journal (21'), the gear wheel 
being in drive connection by means of a toothed belt 

(36) with a gear wheel (37) of a double gear wheel (38) 
mounted rotatably both on the shaft (25') and in the 

frame (24'), the second gear wheel (39) of this double 
gear wheel similarly being connected by means of a 

second toothed belt (40) with a double intermediate 
gear wheel (41), which engages by way of its spur gear 

(42) with a drive wheel (32') secured on an axle 
journal (31') of the gripper-type folding-blade 

cylinder (15'). 
Folding apparatus according to claim 5 or 6,  
 

characterised in that a working cylinder (34; 34'), 
operated by fluid pressure and pivotably connected to 

the frame (24) is articulated at least on one of the 
levers (22; 22') 
Folding apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the stapling cylinder (49) and 

staple-closing cylinder (48), arranged in the conveyor 
belt system (47) are respectively partially surrounded 

by the lower (50) and upper belts (51) of the conveyor 
belt system (47).
