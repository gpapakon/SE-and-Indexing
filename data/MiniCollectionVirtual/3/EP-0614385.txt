<ABSTRACT>
A pen-shaped syringe with automatic needle insertion has an injection system integrally displaceable in a housing (1) and comprising a basic part (17) carrying a medicine reservoir with a hypodermic needle at its distal end, and a dosing mechanism with a carrier (34) engaging a cogged piston rod (35), the carrier being coupled to a dose spindle (25) in a rotatable but not displaceable way. The dose spindle (25) is provided with a thread engaging a thread in a sequence part (20) having protrusions (22) engaging slots (21) in the basic part (17) to allow a limited axial movement of the parts (20, 17) in relation to each other, the extent of the movement being defined by the rotational position of the dose spindle (25). A spring (23) is compressed between the basic part (17) and the housing (1) when the basic part is moved in the proximal direction by exerting a cocking force on the sequence part (20), which part after having performed the set limited axial movement in relation to the basic part (17) carries this basic part against the force of the spring (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pen-shaped syringes with automatic needle 
insertion, which syringes have an injecting system comprising a basic part carrying 
a medicine reservoir being at its distal end provided with a hypodermic needle and 
being at its proximal end closed by a piston, a dosing mechanism having a carrier 
engaging a cogging on a piston rod to advance this rod in the distal direction to 
press the piston into the reservoir a distance corresponding to a set dose when an 
injection button is pressed, the injection system being integrally displaceable in a 
housing by a spring which may be compressed and released to displace the 
injecting system in the distal direction in the housing to insert the needle into the skin 
of a patient. Such pen shaped syringes are used by patients who treat themselves 
by frequently injecting a medicine dose which may be set individually immediately 
before each injection, and the setting is deleted when the injection is performed. 
Often the same dose is used by a number of injections, and consequently some 
patients might wish for a syringe by which the dose does not have to be set before 
each injection. Especially patients to whom a reduced tactile motor function makes 
it difficult to perform the setting would appreciate a syringe by which a setting is not 
deleted by the injection, but is remembered until it is altered voluntarily. It is the object of the invention to provide a syringe with automatic 
needle insertion, which syringe stores a setting of the dose and automatically sets 
that dose when the automatic needle insertion mechanism of the syringe is cocked. This is obtained by a pen shaped syringe as described above, which 
syringe according to the invention is characterized in, that the carrier is coupled to 
a dose spindle in a rotatable but not displaceable way, the dose spindle being 
provided with a thread engaging a thread in a sequence part, the sequence part and 
the basic part of the injection system being provided with mutually engaging 
protrusions and slots allowing a set limited axial movement of these parts in relation 
to each other, the basic part being affected by said spring mounted to be compressed 
when the basic part is moved in the proximal direction in the housing by cocking 
forces exerted on the sequence part.  
 According to an embodiment of 
the invention, a ramrod may be mounted displaceably 
axially in the housing with an outer end accessible for operating the ramrod, and an 
inner end abutting a protrusion on the
