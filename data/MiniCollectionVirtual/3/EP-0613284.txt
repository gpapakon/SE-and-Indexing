<ABSTRACT>
A wide format scanner moves a substrate to be 
scanned along a first axis and at a first predetermined 

speed, and moves a scanning head across the substrate 
obliquely with respect to the first axis at an angle and 

at a speed coordinated with the first predetermined speed 
so as to provide a scan trace perpendicular to the first 

axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
electro-optical scanners. Various types of scanners are known in the 
marketplace and in the patent literature. Most of them 
employ a scan trace which extends perpendicularly to the 
direction of displacement of the scanned substrate and 
thus operates in a stepped motion. There exist two basic techniques for scanning 
large formats. One technique, using multiple CCD arrays, 
is described in "A High-Resolution, High-Speed Film 
Scanner System Using Optically Butted Charge-Coupled 
Devices (CCDs)" by Richard A. Whittlesey, SPIE, Vol. 149, 
Applications of Digital Image Processing (1978), pages 
156-165. Another technique, employing a single CCD array 
which is displaced through multiple sweeps along an X - Y 
plane, is described in U.S. Patent 4,692,812. U.S. Patent 4,525,828 to Higashiyama et al 
describes an optical recording device, including a 
magnetic recording tape, a pair of magnets and a rotary 
drum. The tape is driven obliquely on the outer 
circumference of the drum causing a laser beam to create  
 
a retrace line on the tape which is inclined with respect 
to the longitudinal direction of the tape. U.S. Patent 2,044,831 to Chereau et al 
describes a message scanning or reconstituting system 
including a curved surface or message carrier involving 
relative displacement of the scanning system and of the 
message carrier. The message carrier is caused to 
undergo translation movement along a given axis by moving 
the message oblique along the carrier, i.e. by displacing 
the message along a helix traced on a cylindrical 
surface. U.S. Patent 3,314,075 to Becker et al describes 
a light recording system utilizing a laser, a beam 
guiding assembly and a recording head and film drive for 
producing a series of closely spaced helically spaced 
traces across a film. The present invention seeks to provide a 
scanner which can be operative in a continuous rather 
than a stepped mode of operation. There is provided in accordance with a 
preferred embodiment of the present invention a scanner 
comprising apparatus for displacing a substrate to be 
scanned along a first axis and at a first speed, a 
scanning head operative to scan the substrate, and  
 
apparatus for moving the scanning head across the 
substrate obliquely with respect to the first axis at an 
angle and at a speed coordinated with the first speed so 
as to provide a scan trace across the substrate which is 
perpendicular to the first axis. For the purposes of the present application, 
the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A scanner comprising means for displacing a 
substrate to be scanned along a first axis and at a first 

speed, a scanning head operative to scan the substrate, and 
means for moving the scanning head across the substrate 

obliquely with respect to the first axis at an angle and at 
a speed coordinated with the first speed so as to provide 

a scan trace across the substrate which is perpendicular to 
the first axis. 
A scanner according to Claim 1, also comprising 
a single motor for simultaneously operating both the means 

for displacing and the means for moving, thereby providing 
coordinated operation of said displacing means and of said 

moving means. 
A scanner according to either Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the scanning head comprises a linear scanning 

element and means for selectably orienting the linear 
scanning element relative to the first axis, thereby 

determining the scan resolution.

linear scanning element comprises a reading scanner 

element. 
A scanner according to either Claim 3 or Claim 4, 
wherein the linear scanning element comprises a CCD 

scanning array. 
A scanner according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, 
wherein the linear scanning element comprises a writing 

scanner. 
A scanner according to any one of Claims 3 to 6, 
wherein the linear scanning element comprises a laser 

writing head. 
A scanner according to any preceding Claim, 
wherein the operation of the means for displacing and the 

means for moving is coordinated to provide a complete scan 
of the substrate. 
A scanner according to any preceding Claim, 
further comprising an endless drive element, the scanning 

head being rotatably mounted on the endless drive element, 
and means providing reciprocal motion of the scanning head. 
A scanner according to any preceding Claim, 
wherein the means for displacing comprises vacuum 

engagement means.
