<ABSTRACT>
An automatic vessel supplying and labeling 
apparatus 
takes out a desired vessel (30) from racks 
(12A, 12B), supplies it to a predetermined position, 

supplies a desired label (22), corresponding to the 
vessel, to the position, and applies the label to the 

vessel in the predetermined position. A judging unit 
(94) checks the label information on the vessel, and 

judges whether the label is correctly applied to the 
vessel, and the vessel is sorted into one of two places 

(98a, 98b), one place for collecting vessels with 
correctly applied labels and the other for collecting 

vessels with not correctly applied labels in accordance 
with the result of judgment. The label is applied to 

the vessel after a sensor (77) detects the label supplied 
to the predetermined position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic 
vessel supplying and labeling apparatus for automatically 
taking out a desired vessel from various vessels 
which are stored in accordance with a specific classification 
and automatically applying a corresponding label 
to the taken-out vessel. The automatic vessel supplying and labeling apparatus 
as described above is used, for example to automatically 
take out a desired number of test tubes of desired 
sizes for use in desired tests from test tubes of 
various sizes, and to automatically apply labels, 
showing desired information necessary for the test, to 
the taken-out test tubes. More specifically, the automatic vessel supplying 
and labeling apparatus is used to apply bar-code labels, 
showing desired information, to blood-collecting tubes 
automatically taken out from vessel classification and 
storage means. For example in a hospital, when a patient is subjected 
to various blood tests, first, blood-collecting 
tubes of various sizes optimal for the tests are prepared. 
To each of the blood-collecting tubes label is 
applied for showing desired information such as the name 
of a patient, the date of blood collection, the medical 
department in charge, the name of a doctor in charge and 
the type of a blood test.  Then, blood is extracted from the patient into the 
blood-collecting tubes of various sizes in the proper 
amount. The blood-collecting tubes containing the blood 
are transported to a blood-test station inside or outside 
the hospital. In the blood-test station, the 
blood-collecting tubes are respectively transferred to 
blood-test apparatuses or blood-test sections in accordance 
with the types of test and are subjected to the 
corresponding blood test. The results obtained by the 
blood-test apparatuses or sections are gathered after 
the tests and written on a blood test report and the 
report is transported to the medical department of the 
hospital in charge. The above procedures other than the blood test have 
been simplified by automation using bar code labels. 
However, the aforementioned conventional automatic test 
tube supplying and labeling apparatuses used in hospitals 
frequently fail to apply labels to tubes, and 
demand has arisen for a more reliable apparatus for preparing 
blood-collecting tubes and applying labels to the 
tubes. The present invention has been derived from the 
above situation and its object is to provide an automatic 
vessel supplying and labeling apparatus which can 
apply labels to vessels such as

<CLAIMS>
An automatic vessel supplying and labeling 
apparatus for taking out a desired vessel from vessel 

classification storage means (12A, 12B, 12C, 12D, 12E) 
which stores various vessels (30) in accordance with a 

predetermined classification, supplying the desired 
vessel to a predetermined position, preparing various 

labels (22) on which information is displayed, supplying 
a desired label, corresponding to the desired vessel, in 

the various labels to the predetermined position and 
applying the desired label supplied to the predetermined 

position to the desired vessel supplied to the 
predetermined position, characterized by further 

comprising: 
   label supply detection means (77) for detecting the 

desired label (22) supplied to the predetermined 
position by the label supplying means; 

   label application judging means (94) for checking 
the information on the desired label applied to the 

desired vessel, and for judging whether the desired 
label is correctly applied to the desired vessel or not; 

and 
   vessel sorting means (82) for sorting the desired 

vessel to which the desired label is applied into one of 
two places, one place of which for collecting vessels on 

which labels are correctly applied, and the other place 
of which for collecting vessels on which labels are not 

correctly applied, in accordance with the result of 
judgment of the label application judging means, 

   and characterized in that the desired label 
supplied to the predetermined position is applied to the 

desired vessel supplied to the predetermined position, 
after the label supply detection means detects that the 

desired label (22) have been supplied to the 
predetermined position.
