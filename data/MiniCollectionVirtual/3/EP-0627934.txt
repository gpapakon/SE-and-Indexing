<DESCRIPTION>
 EARLY ANTIGEN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DIABETESThis work was supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.Technical FieldThe invention relates to factors useful in diagnosis and therapy of type I diabetes. More specifically, it concerns markers in β islet cells that mediate T-cell proliferation and stimulation associated with induction of the disease.Background ArtType I diabetes is known to be a chronic auto- immune disease that manifests itself early in life. This condition, also called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is considered a hereditary disease although nonfamilial forms also occur. The nature of the genetic control of type I diabetes has been studied in detail. It appears clear that genes associated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are involved in the hereditary transmission of the disease (Wicker, .S. et al., J Exp Med (1987) 165.:1639-1654) . Several groups have demonstrated a correlation between the absence of an aspartic residue at position 57 of the /3-chain in the human HLA-DQ class II MHC encoded glycoprotein and the occurrence of the disease (Parha , P. Nature (1990) 24 :662-664; Todd, J.A. et al., Nature (1987) 3_29_:599- 604; Morel, P.A. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1988) £5_:8111-8115) . 

 The most ubiquitously used model for the human form of type I diabetes is the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. The NOD strain of mice was originally selected by Makino, S. et al., Exp Anim (Tokyo) (1980) 2-2.:1, for its predisposition to develop a spontaneous form of diabetes. The disease as it manifests itself in this model is similar to that found in humans. There is a progressive infiltration of the pancreatic islets by mononuclear cells, mostly of T-cell origin, long prior to the onset of the symptoms of the disease which leads to the destruction of the insulin-producing S-cells. This occurs in the similar BB rat model system (see below) as long as 8 weeks before the onset of IDDM. It has been demonstrated that the NOD disease is controlled by at least three genes, one of which segregates with the MHC (Hattori, M. et al., Science (1986) 231:733: Prochaska, M. et al., Science (1987) 237d:286: Wicker, L. et al., ζ∑ Exp Med (1987) 165:1639 (supra)).In the course of the disease, the insulin- producing β-cells of the pancreatic islets are selectively destroyed; other endocrine islet cells, α cells, such as those that produce glucagon or somatostatin are unaffected. The destruction of the β-

Claims
1. An antigen in purified and isolated form, which antigen is isolatable from pancreatic islet β-cells and which antigen has a monomer molecular weight in the range of about 30-60 kd and is capable of stimulating the proliferation of NOD murine T-cells in the presence of antigen-presenting cells.
2. The antigen of claim 1 which is isolatable from human pancreatic islet /3-cell membranes, and has a molecular weight of about 37 kd, 41 kd or 51 kd as determined by HPEC; or which is isolatable from murine pancreatic islet jS-cell membranes and has a molecular weight of about 36 kd, 42 kd or 55 kd, as determined by gel electrophoresis.
3. A peptide fragment of a protein antigen of claim 1 which fragment binds to the MHC class II-encoded glycoprotein on antigen presenting cells (APC) to form a complex wherein said complex is recognized by NOD murine T-cells or a modified form thereof which binds to the MHC class II-encoded glycoprotein on APC to form a complex, wherein said complex is not recognized by NOD murine T- cells.
4. A recombinant DNA in purified and isolated form which encodes a protein antigen of claim 1; or a recombinant DNA which encodes a protein antigen of claim 1 included in an expression system capable of expressing said encoding DNA when contained in a host cell, which expression system comprises said 



encoding DNA operably linked to control sequences compatible with said host.
5. A recombinant host cell which contains the expression system of claim 4.
6. A method to produce a protein useful in therapy and diagnosis of type I diabetes which protein is isolatable from pancreatic islet β-cells and which protein has a monomer molecular weight in the range of
30-60 kd and is capable of stimulating the proliferation of NOD murine T-cells in the presence of antigen- presenting cells, which method comprises culturing the cells of claim 5 under conditions which permit the expression of said encoding DNA; and recovering the protein from the cell culture.
7. Antibodies or immunologically reactive fragments thereof specifically immunoreactive with the antigen of claim 1, which antibodies or fragments are in purified and isolated form; or are contained in a composition substantially free of red blood cells; or are substantially free of plasma proteins; or are monoclonal antibodies.
8. A method to identify an individual developing type I diabetes which method comprises contacting T-cells obtained from said individual with the antigen of claim 1 under conditions of a T-cell proliferation assay; and determining the ability of said T-cells to proliferate in the presence of said antigen; 


 so as to identify an individual whose T-cells proliferate under these conditions as developing type I diabetes.
9. A method to identify an individual developing type I diabetes which method comprises contacting serum or plasma obtained from said individual with the antigen of claim 1 under conditions whereby antibodies immunoreactive with the antigen of claim 1 will form a complex; and detecting the presence or absence of said complex; so as to identify an individual providing serum or plasma capable of forming said complex as developing type I diabetes.
10. The antigen of claim 1 in nonimmunogenic form or the peptide of claim 3 for use in preventing development or progression of Type I diabetes.
11.. The antigen of claim 1 in nonimmunogenic form or the peptide of claim 3 in combination with an immune modulator for use in preventing development or progression of Type I diabetes.
12. A pharmaceutical composition useful in preventing the development or progression of type I diabetes which comprises as active ingredient the antigen of claim 1 in nonimmunogenic form or the peptide of claim 3 in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, and optionally further containing an immune modulator. 


 13. The composition of claim 12 wherein said immune modulator comprises anti-CD4 antibodies or immunoreactive fragments thereof.
14. A composition free of red blood cells which is enriched in T-cells responsive to the antigen of claim 1.
