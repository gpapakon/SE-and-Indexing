<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to centrifugal methods and devices for 
concentrating macromolecules from a solution. There has been a number of analytical procedures developed in 
the biochemical art wherein it is required to remove solvent 
from e.g. protein solutions in order to have a more 
concentrated protein sample which can be analysed 
effectively, or in order to have a protein free filtrate for 
analysis, or to replace or remove low molecular weight ions 
or solutes, or to study protein binding attributes of various 
chemicals in combination with various protein samples. Many 
other analytical procedures involving not only proteins but 
macromolecular species in general, have also been developed 
wherein it is necessary to concentrate a macromolecular 
component in a liquid sample. When concentrating small volumes of macromolecules in 
solution using filtration, e.g. ultrafiltration, there exist 
the problems of macromolecular binding to the membrane 
surface and of filtration to dryness. If part of the 
retentate is adsorbed on the membrane surface the yield of 
the process will of course decrease and the filtration time 
will increase due to the decreasing effective membrane area. In the design of centrifugal filtration devices, the 
effective membrane area to sample volume to be filtered has 
been limited by the designs proposed. Low membrane area to 
volume ratios provide good recovery but low filtration rates. 
Conversely low volume and large membrane surfaces result in 
faster filtration but lower recoveries due to the protein 
binding to the membrane surface.  
 In the prior art, the centrifugal self-cleaning ultrafilter, 
described in US-A-3 488 768, 
is limited due to the large membrane 
surface area which causes excessive adsorptive loss of the 
macromolecules. The initial advantage of a high flow rate through a large 
filter surface area is rapidly limited as the concentration 
goes on and the physical surface area is decreasing. The flow 
rate through the remaining filter area is also reduced by the 
effect of concentration polarization. On the other hand, more recent designs such as AMICON MPS-1 
Micropartition system (AMICON Publication 472) and the AMICON 
CENTRICON device described in US-A-4 632 761 limits membrane 
surface area to the area at the bottom of the sample 
reservoir tube, frequently resulting in a poor ratio of 
membrane surface area to sample volume and extended 
concentration time. The dead stop feature which stops the sample concentrating to 
dryness according to US-A-4
