<ABSTRACT>
A process for freeze drying coffee extract in the form of pellets combines short freezing times with high drying pressures, saving time and energy in comparison with conventional processes. The thus obtained product has an excellent flavour and its surface reminds one of freshly roasted coffee beans.

<CLAIMS>
Process for freeze-drying coffee extract,
characterized in that


a) coffee extract with a dry substance content of 35
to 45 wt/vol.% is foamed to a foam weight or 450

to 750 g/l,
b) the foamed coffee extract is dropped onto a
cooled belt for the formation of pellets and the

pellets are frozen on the belt to temperatures
below -30°C, and
c) the frozen pellets are dried at pressures in the
range of 0.8 to 1.5 mbar.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the foam temperature in stage b) at the end of the

foaming process is -2 to -4°C.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that in stage b) the foamed coffee extract is

dropped onto the cooled belt in each case in a 
quantity such that pellets with a diameter of 4 to 7

mm and with a height of approximately 2.5 to 3.5 mm
form.
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the pellets in stage b) are frozen for 2 to 3

minutes to temperatures between -30 and -40°C.
Process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the pellets in stage c) are freeze-dried to a

density of 150 to 300 g/l.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the freeze drying in stage c) is carried out at

pressures in the range from 0.8 to 1.5 mbar during
the total drying time.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the freeze drying in stage c) is carried out at

pressures in the range from 0.8 to 1.5 mbar only
during a phase of 10-50% of the total drying time

and lower pressures are used for the remaining
drying time.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the freeze drying in stage c) is carried out at

pressures in the range from 0.8 to 1.5 mbar for only
0.5 to 2 hours and lower pressures are used for the

remaining drying time.
