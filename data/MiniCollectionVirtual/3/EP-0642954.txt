<ABSTRACT>
A device is proposed which is used for the adjustment of a component (100) of a motor vehicle between two end positions. The adjustment device (10) includes a device casing, in which there are mounted an electric driving motor and a step-down gear system arranged downstream of the latter and the gear drive wheel (32), which is operatively connected to the component, cooperates with a rotary potentiometer (52) which infuences the adjusting movement of the drive wheel and the base part (50) of which is fixedly connected to the casing. A particularly simple, cost-effective structure of the adjustment device is provided if the gear drive wheel (32) engages by means of a central projection (66) in a central recess (60) of the rotary part of the rotary potentiometer (52).
