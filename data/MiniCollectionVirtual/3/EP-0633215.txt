<ABSTRACT>
The fall-prevention (drop-prevention) system allows heavy and bulky objects to be transported, by suspension, with a maximum degree of safety. It comprises a cage (40) surrounding the package to be grasped and fixed to a central hub (2) supporting a gripper sucker (1). In the lower part (6) of this cage (40) there are pivoting catches (10) which release themselves into a separated position underneath the package to be grasped as soon as the latter has been lifted up by the sucker (1). Application to the handling of containers, containing radioactive waste.
