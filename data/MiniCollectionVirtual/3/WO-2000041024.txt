<ABSTRACT>
A system is disclosed for capturing super wide-angle panoramic images. In particular, a two-reflector system is disclosed which is substantially self-correcting in which optical aberrations are substantially eliminated, such as field curvature, astigmatism and the like. Moreover, the super wide-angle panoramic imaging apparatus of the invention captures a super-wide field of view from a substantially single reference viewpoint. The invention provides a substantially compact viewpoint, while also having a substantially flat and stigmatic image plane, in the context of a super wide-angle panoramic system. Devices and methods for capturing panoramic images of super wide-angle scenes are provided. In a particular embodiment of the invention, two reflectors are provided (e.g., one a hyperboloidal mirror, the other a concave ellipsoidal or spherical mirror), a relay system (e.g., optics such as a mirror, a lens, a pinhole and the like) and an image sensor (e.g., an electronic photo-sensor, a film and the like).

<DESCRIPTION>
 PANORAMIC IMAGING APPARATUS1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to panoramic image sensing of a super wide-angle field of view, and in particular, it relates to such image sensing using a two-mirror subsystem that is substantially self- corrected. The term "panoramic" means a 360° field of view in a horizontal plane while the term "super wide-angle" means a 120° or larger field of view in a vertical plane. Preferably, the field of view in a vertical plane is greater than about 180°. More preferably, it is greater than about 200°. And, for the desired apparatus, most preferably, it is greater than about 260°.2. Background of the Invention A perspective imaging system collects rays of light from the scene that pass through a single point of reference and projects them onto a sensing element such as film or a charge coupled device (CCD). The single point of reference in the perspective imaging system is known as the viewpoint of the system. Yamazawa et al., "Omnidirectional Imaging with Hyperboloidal Projection", IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 1993, by Nalwa, "A True Omnidirectional Viewer", ATT Bell Laboratories Technical Memorandum, BLOl 15500-960115-01, Jan. 1996 and by Nayar, "Omnidirectional Video Camera", DARPA Image Understanding Workshop, May 1997, all incorporated herein by reference, describe the need for a single viewpoint. We have determined that the nature of light propagation through the imaging system and the shape of imaging sensor may introduce geometric transformations in the image projected onto the sensing element. In a large number of applications including surveillance, remote sensing, navigation, model acquisition, virtual reality, computer vision and robotics, it is desirable that these geometric transformations be corrected for the purposes of viewing and analysis. The lack of a single viewpoint introduces aberrations in pupils which manifests itself as uncorrectable geometric transformations (distortions).A classification of imaging systems based on their field of view is:1. Traditional imaging systems that image a narrow field of view, usually an octant of the sphere of view (up to 90 degrees).2. Panoramic imaging systems that image a panorama of the scene. The field of view can be looked upon as a sphere truncated by two parallel planes giving a 360 degree field of view in the horizontal and a limited field of view in the vertical.3. Omnidirectional imaging systems that image substantially spherical or substantially hemispherical fields of
