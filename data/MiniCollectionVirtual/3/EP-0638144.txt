<ABSTRACT>
The proposal relates to a gear machine (pump or motor) having two outwardly engaging pairs of gears (21, 22) in staggered array which are secured by gearing (30) to a drive shaft (31) in which the number of teeth of the gearing (30) is an even multiple of the external teeth of the driven pinions (16, 18). The width (b) of the teeth of the driven pinions (16, 18) on the drive shaft (31) is smaller than the width (B) of the gears and especially smaller than half the gear width (B). This provides the gear machine with better mechanical properties and increases its efficiency. The invention is also applicable to gear machines with only one pair of gears (21a).

<CLAIMS>
Gear machine with two gear pairs (21, 22) which 
mesh with one another in external engagement, are 

separated from one another by an intermediate plate (23) 
and the driven gears (16, 18) of which are secured on a 

drive shaft (31) by means of toothing (30), characterized 
in that the width (b) of the toothing (30) joining the 

driven gears (16, 18) to the drive shaft (31) is less 
than the width (B) of the driven gears (16, 18), in that 

the driven gears (16, 18) rest in positive engagement, by 
way of offsets (29), on the end faces of the toothing 

(30), and in that the driven gears (16, 18) are arranged 
without radial play on the drive shaft (31). 
Gear machine with two gears (16a, 17a) which mesh 
with one another in external engagement, and the driven 

gear (16a) of which is secured on a drive shaft (31a) by 
means of toothing (30a), characterized in that the width 

(b) of the toothing (30a) joining the driven gear (16a) 
to the drive shaft (31a) is less than the width (B) of 

the driven gear (16a), in that the driven gear (16a) 
rests in positive engagement, by way of an offset (29a), 

on the end face of the toothing (30a), and in that the 
driven gear (16a) is arranged without radial play on the 

drive shaft (31a). 
Gear machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the width (b) of the toothing (30) 

of the driven gears (16, 16a, 18) is less than half the 
width (B) of the gears (16, 16a, 18). 
Gear machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the number of teeth of the toothing 

(30, 30a) joining the driven gears (16, 16a, 18) to the 
drive shaft (31, 31a) is an even multiple of the number  

 
of teeth of the driven gears (16, 16a, 18). 
Gear machine according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the driven gear (16a) is secured in the axial 

direction on the drive shaft (31a) by means of a 
retaining element (37). 
Gear machine according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the retaining element (37) is arranged in a 

recess (38) in a bearing body (33a).
