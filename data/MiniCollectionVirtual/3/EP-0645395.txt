<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to vinyl- and alkoxy-functional
organosilicon compounds that contain alkoxy
group which is highly reactive with the silanol group
and to a method for their preparationA large number of alkoxy-functional
organosilicon compounds in which alkoxy is bonded to
silicon are already known. These are widely used as
coupling agents for bonding glass fibers and organic
resins and as chain extenders and crosslinkers for
silicone polymers and organic polymers. Examples of
these alkoxy-functional organosilicon compounds include
monofunctional alkoxysilanes (1 silicon-bonded alkoxy
group is present), difunctional alkoxysilanes (2
silicon-bonded alkoxy groups are present),
trifunctional alkoxysilanes (3 silicon-bonded alkoxy
groups are present), and tetrafunctional alkoxysilanes
(4 silicon-bonded alkoxy groups are present). EP-A 0 480 680 describes a silicone rubber laminate comprising
a dielectric layer formed from a silicone rubber composition in
cured form comprising an organopolysiloxane containing alkenyl
groups and an organosilicon compound having an alkenyl group per
molecule and a methoxy group. From Chemical Abstracts, vol. 116,
no. 22, 01 June 1992, abstract no. 215 662, alkoxysilanes for
crosslinking of siloxanes at room temperature are known. Chemical
Abstracts, vol. 116, no. 14, 06. April 1992, abstract no.
129 932y relates to silicone powders and their manufacture which
are prepared from silanes containing a vinyl group and alkoxy
groups. Chemical Abstracts, vol. 115, no. 25, 23 December 1991,
abstract no. 280 283n describes the preparation of alkylsilyl-containing
organosiloxanes, ie 2-methyl-1,1-diphenyl-3,3,3-trimethoxydisiloxane.
As the
number of alkoxy groups in these alkoxysilanes
diminishes, the hydrolyzability of the alkoxy groups
and their condensation reactivity with the silanol
group decline. As a consequence, the difunctional and
trifunctional alkoxysilanes are substantially less
reactive than the tetrafunctional alkoxysilanes. This
has created demand for alkoxy-functional organosilicon
compounds that exhibit high reactivity for
tetrafunctional alkoxysilanes. The inventors have
proposed an alkoxy-functional organosilicon compound
with the following formula for use as a chain extender
in US Patent 5,300,612, issued April 5, 1994, to Toshio
Saruyama,
((CH3)3SiO)2Si(OCH3)2 .  
However, the alkoxy groups in this particular
organosilicon compound do not have a very high
condensation reactivity with the silanol group, and
this compound is therefore not fully satisfactory for
som
