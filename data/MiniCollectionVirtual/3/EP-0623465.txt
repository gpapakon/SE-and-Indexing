<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for processing viscous or highly viscous fluids for finishing printed products in a finishing unit on a rotary printing machine, the finishing unit comprising a plurality of rollers, which can be supplied at least at one feed point and cylinders which can be supplied by said rollers. The invention is characterised in that the supply of fluid to the lacquer-conducting cylinders (12, 13) takes place by means of a metering roller (2) which can be supplied either both via a roller (20) which can be pivoted into a first position (20') and via a feed roller (3) from a lacquer trough (10) or can be supplied from a part (26) of a roller, either between the metering roller (2) and the roller (20) which can be pivoted into a second position (20'') or between the metering roller (2) and a stationary roller (3, 4).

Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids for finishing printed products in a finishing unit

(1) on a rotary printing machine, the finishing unit (1)
comprising a plurality of rollers (2, 3) able to be

supplied by means of at least one feed location as well
as cylinders (12, 13) able to be supplied by means of the

latter, and the feed of the fluid to varnish-conveying
cylinders (12, 13) takes place via a metering roller (2),

which can be supplied from a roller wedge (26) between
the metering roller (2) and a stationary roller (3),

characterized in that the metering roller (2) can be
supplied from a varnish trough (10) pivotably or via a

pivotable roller (20) or via the feed roller (3).
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 1, characterized in that the

metering roller (2) can be displaced along an adjusting
path (11) between the feed roller (3) arranged in a

stationary manner and a squeeze roller (4).
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 2, characterized in that a

second varnish feed (5) is arranged above a roller
wedge (26), which is formed between the metering

roller (2) and the squeeze roller (4).
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 2, characterized in that sheet-metal

catchers (8, 9, 10) are arranged in a cascade
underneath the feed roller (3).
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 2, characterized in that in the

case of the metering roller (2) pivoted onto the squeeze 
roller (4) into a contact position (2''), an indirect

application of varnish to a varnishing blanket
cylinder (12) takes place via a plate cylinder (13).
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 1, characterized in that a feed

roller (3) which can be reversed in terms of its
direction of rotation is assigned to the metering

roller (2) which is supported in a stationary manner in
the finishing unit (1) and the squeeze roller (4).
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 1, characterized in that the

pivotable roller (20), which is assigned to the metering
roller (2), can be pivoted together with a varnish

supply (21) into first positions (20', 21') and into
second positions (20'', 21'').
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 7, characterized in that the

pivotable roller (20) and the varnish supply (21)
describe pivoting paths (22, 23) during the joint

pivoting movements.
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 1, characterized in that the

pivotable roller (20) and a varnish supply (21) can be
moved, with respect to the metering roller (2), in first

positions (20', 21') and into second positions
(20'', 21'').
Device for processing viscous or highly viscous
fluids according to Claim 1, characterized in that wedge

elements (7) and varnish troughs (10, 25) are mounted in
a stationary manner in side-walls (18).
