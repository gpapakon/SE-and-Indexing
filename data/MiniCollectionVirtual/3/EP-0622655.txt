<ABSTRACT>
According to the display device of the present 
invention, counter electrodes are formed in stripes (41) at a 

position facing pixel electrodes, with a polymer dispersion 
liquid crystal held between the counter electrodes and pixel 

electrodes. When a positive-polarity signal is to be 
impressed to a pixel electrode, a negative-polarity voltage 

is fed to the counter electrode. On the other hand, when a 
negative-polarity signal is to be impressed to a pixel 

electrode, a positive-polarity voltage is added to the counter 
electrode. In this impressing manner of voltages, a high 

voltage can be applied to the polymer dispersion liquid 
crystal layer on the pixel electrodes, so that the liquid 

crystal layer is turned into the transmitting state even if 
it is thick. Accordingly, the scattering efficiency is 

improved and images are displayed with high contrast as the 
liquid crystal layer can be made thick. If the thick 

transparent substrate (212) is bonded to at least one of the substrates 
(11,12) the light scattered at 

the liquid crystal layer is reflected by the thick substrate 
and returned back to the liquid crystal layer, thus eliminating 

the light to be scattered again. The display contrast is 
improved. When the display device is utilized as a light 

valve of a projection-type display apparatus, it realizes a 
video equipment able to display images on a large screen with 

high luminance and high contrast.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display device 
designed to form optical images by modulating the incident 
light, and also a projection-type display apparatus realizing 
a large-screen display by magnifying and projecting images 
formed by the display device onto a screen. Because of the light-weight and thin-size of display 
devices using a liquid crystal (referred to as a liquid 
crystal display device hereinafter), enthusiastic researches 
and developments have been directed to this field lately. For 
instance, a pocket-size TV using a twist nematic (TN) liquid 
crystal which applies the optical rotatory power of the liquid 
crystal has been brought on the market and moreover, a 
projection-type display apparatus utilizing the aforementioned 
TN panel as a light valve has also been in practical use. The above TN liquid crystal panel requires the 
incident light to be linearly polarized through a polarizing 
plate for modulation. However, the polarizing plate absorbs 
or reflects 50% or more of the incident light, and therefore, 
the using efficiency of light becomes poor in the liquid  
 
crystal display device using the TN liquid crystal panel. The 
display luminance is disadvantageously low as well. A proposal to solve the above problem is a liquid 
crystal display panel using a polymer dispersion liquid 
crystal in place of the TN liquid crystal. The polymer 
dispersion liquid crystal panel can modulate the light without 
using a polarizing plate. The polymer dispersion liquid 
crystal will be briefly depicted hereinbelow. The polymer dispersion liquid crystal is roughly 
separated into two types as follows based on the dispersed 
state of a liquid crystal and a polymer material. Drops of 
a liquid crystal are dispersed in a polymer material in one 
type, that is, the liquid crystal is present in the polymer 
material in the discontinuous state (which will be represented 
as PDLC hereinafter, and a liquid crystal panel using PDLC 
will be denoted as a PD liquid crystal panel). The other type 
of the polymer dispersion liquid crystal has a network of 
polymers spread in a liquid crystal layer, most similar to the 
state of a liquid crystal contained in a sponge. The liquid 
crystal in the structure of a network is continuous, not 
appearing in the form of drops (referred to as PNLC hereinafter). 
The display of images in the above two kinds of liquid 
crystal panels is achieved by controlling scattering and 
transmission of light.  PDLC utilizes the fact that the index of refraction 
is
