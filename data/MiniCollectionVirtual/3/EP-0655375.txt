<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in
solenoid-operated fluid-flow control valves. In
particular, the invention is concerned with
solenoid-operated flow control valves for use in
hydraulic anti-lock braking systems for vehicles.In known hydraulic anti-lock braking systems, a
master cylinder is normally in communication with a
brake via a flow control valve. The control valve
comprises a hollow valve body with a flow control
orifice working in a bore against a control spring to
control communication between the master cylinder, the
brake and an expander chamber. A pump is connected
between the flow control valve and the master
cylinder. An expander chamber, reservoir, dump or
other low pressure source is present between the pump
and the flow control valve. A normally-closed
solenoid-operated valve is located between the
reservoir and a spring control chamber housing the
control spring.In anti-lock braking, on detection of a skid
signal, the solenoid-operated valve opens to connect
the control spring chamber and the brake to the
expander chamber. Fluid pressure from the brake is
then released to the expander chamber. The pressure
differential developed across the valve body moves it
to isolate the master cylinder from the brake, and the
pump is energised to pump fluid from the expander
chamber to the master cylinder. Once the wheel
recovers, the solenoid-operated valve is switched to
isolate the brake from the expander chamber. The
pumped fluid now reapplies the brake. The brake 
pressure is able to build until it matches the master
cylinder pressure and the valve body returns to its
normal operating position. However, in practice, when
the solenoid-operated valve isolates the brake from the
expander chamber, there is a sudden build up of
pressure, or a pressure spike, in the control spring
chamber. This causes the valve body to be forced back
into its normal operating position, immediately
re-connecting the master cylinder to the brake, and
re-applying the brake. In such circumstances control
of the brake on re-application is lost.In summary, previous fluid-flow control valves in
use in hydraulic braking systems have followed a three
stage approach:-
1. To isolate the master cylinder from the
brake;2. To open the brake to an expander chamber,
reservoir, dump or some other low pressure source;
and3. To allow the valve body to move to a metering
position to control the re-application of the
brake.While this approach works well, as described above
it can lead to problems.Also, in flow control valves in
