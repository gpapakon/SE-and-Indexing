<ABSTRACT>
A refuse container has a container body (5) which is open at the top and which, when it is put to use, is closed with a lid (3) which has a likewise closable feeder opening. To prevent the lid (3) coming loose from the container body (5) which is closed by it, a lid-securing means is provided whose one part is designed in the form of a plurality of catch elements (8) which are arranged spaced apart from one another and which protrude elastically from the container body (5) or from the lid (3), and whose other part is designed as an abutment (5, 9) for these catch elements, with which abutment the catch elements (8), which are inaccessible after closure of the container body (5) with the lid (3), engage in the manner of a safety catch.

Waste disposal container with a container body which can be
closed by a lid and a lid securing device to prevent deta
ching of
the lid from the container lid opening, the lid securing means

comprising at least two securing parts, one of which is formed on
the container body in the region of the container lid opening and

one is formed on the lid in the region of the lid rim and the one
securing part is formed as an arrangement of a plurality of

latching elements (8) which each project elastically from the
relevant region at least with a portion or component distanced

from adjacent latching elements (8) and directed at least
partially downwards, and the other securing part is formed as an

abutment (9) for the latching elements (8), a latching position
which can be assumed by latching and is determined by the carrier

of the abutment being provided for these latching elements (8) in
the arrangement of the lid (3) provided for the latching elements

in the container lid opening (2), in which latching position the
latching elements (8) mesh with the abutment (9) in a locking

pawl-like manner, characterised in that the rim (6) of the
container lid opening (2) is widened in the manner of a flange,

in that the latching elements (8) are formed externally on this
rim (6) so as to protrude therefrom elastically and have a free

end (8a), the free ends (8a) pointing downwards, in that the lid
(3) has in its container closure arrangement an approximately U-shaped

peripheral collar (4) which surrounds the rim (6) of the
container lid opening (2), in that the abutment (9) is formed

internally on the outer limb (5) of this peripheral collar (4),
in that the free ends (8a) of the latching elements (8) engage in

their latching position in the abutment (9) and in that the rim
(6) widened in the manner of a flange of the container lid

opening (2) forms a sealing support face which promotes the
container tightness. 
Container according to claim 1, with a circular container
lid opening formed by the open container body which is circular

at the top, characterised in that the latching elements (8) are
formed as tongues which are evenly spaced apart from one another

and project from the rim (6) of the container lid opening (2) in
a ring-like manner and in that the abutment is formed as a

latching lip (9) which extends round the inside of the lower edge
of the outer limb (5) of the peripheral collar (4) of the lid.
Container according to claim 2, characterised in that when
the container body (1) is not closed, the tongues (8) project

from the side wall of the container body (1) at an acute angle
formed with the container axis of approximately 30°, and in that

the outer leg (5) of the peripheral collar (4) of the lid forms
an acute angle with the lid axis of approximately 20°.
Container according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that
the thickness of the tongues (8) increases from the tongue root

at the rim (6) of the container lid opening (2) toward the free
tongue end (8a).
Container according at least to claim 2, characterised in
that the width of the latching lip (9) increases at least from

its inner edge (10) to its base.
Container according to at least claim 2, characterised in
that the tongues (8) widen trapezoidally from the tongue root at

the rim (6) of the container lid opening (2) toward the free
tongue end (8a).
