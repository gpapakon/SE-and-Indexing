<CLAIMS>
A prosthetic element made of textile material, intended for treating
ruptures, comprising two layers (1,2) which are parallel and are coupled

together in their central part in thus defining a three-dimensional central zone
(3) and two free end parts (1a, 2a; 1b, 2b) which extend at both sides from

said central zone (3), and which are able to partially embrace a muscle,
characterised in that said three-dimensional central zone (3) is made by

knitting by means of a double needle bed loom.
The prosthetic element according to claim 1, characterised in that
the knitting is made in polyester fibres.
The prosthetic element according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that, after the knitting, the article obtained is impregnated with purified

collagen.
