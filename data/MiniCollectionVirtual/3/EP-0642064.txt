<ABSTRACT>
A heat-fixing apparatus for use in an 
electrophotographic apparatus such as a copying machine. 

It comprises a substrate roller formed of a material 
having a heat conductivity of 0.7 kcal/mhk or less, a 

resistant heat-generating layer provided on the surface 
of the roller, and a surface coat layer provided on the 

resistance heat-generating layer. This heat-fixing 
apparatus has a very high heat efficiency, and can 

perform heat-fixing of a toner at a low consumption of 
electric power. In addition, since the heating is 

carried out rapidly, the rising time is markedly 
shortened, and it is not necessary to perform pre-heating. 

In this respect, too, the electric power to be 
consumed is decreased. Furthermore, since it is a 

roller-type fixing method, it can effectively cope with 

high-speed copying. Moreover, because the apparatus has 
a large strength, the apparatus can be effectively made 

light in weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat fixing 
apparatus for use in an electrophotographic apparatus 
such as a copying apparatus. As a heat-fixing apparatus in commercial 
electrophotographic apparatuses, hollow rollers in which 
a heating source such as a halogen lamp is provided are 
widely utilized. This fixing apparatus of the heat 
roller type performs the fixation of a toner by directly 
contacting a heating surface with the toner on a 
transfer paper, and the fixation can be performed 
uniformly and stably in high speed copying. In 
addition, it has high safety and presents an advantage 
that the apparatus itself is small sized. However, in the convention known heat fixing 
apparatus, an air layer is interposed between the roller 
surface which is a heating surface and a heat source, 
and since heating of the surface of the roller is 
carried out indirectly via the air layer, there is a 
problem of a low efficiency of heat. Furthermore, it 
takes time to heat the roller to a certain temperature, 
and in order to carry out fixation at the same time as 
the beginning of the copying operation, the electric 
power should be always supplied. In order to solve this problem, Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. 242671/1991 provides a flat 
plate-type heater in contact with a thin heat-resistant 
belt and proposes a heat fixation apparatus in which the 
toner is heated and fixed via the belt. This heat fixing apparatus has an increased heat 
efficiency as compared with the heat roller fixation  
 
type apparatus using the halogen lamp, etc. as the heat 
source, and the heat fixation can be carried out at a 
lowered consumed electric power. In addition, it is 
very useful because the time required to heat the heat 
resistant belt to a fixed temperature (the rising time) 
can be shortened. However, since this heat-fixing 
apparatus employs a belt driving method, it is 
impossible to avoid the important problem of the 
deviation of the belt. When the copying is carried out 
at a higher speed, this problem becomes more marked, and 
it becomes difficult to carry out fixation uniformly and 
stably. An apparatus in which a heat roller itself is made 
a heat source is provided. A heat-fixation apparatus of 
this type can cope with high-speed copying, but since a 
heat pipe is embedded in a roller substrate, or a heat-generating 
wire such as a Nichrome wire is interposed 
with an insulation layer and provided in the roller 
substrate, it is still unsatisfactory in fully improving 
the heat efficiency and
