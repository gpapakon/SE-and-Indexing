Process for decontaminating soils polluted with
metallic elements, comprising:


a stage of leaching (I) of the polluted soils
(1) in a basic medium, so as to bring about the selective

dissolution of metallic elements to be removed,
a stage of cementation (II) of the leachate (4)
originating from the leaching stage and bringing about

the deposition (6) of the said elements in metal form,
performed by exchange with metallic zinc,
and a stage of electrolysis (III) of the
solution (7) originating from the cementation stage,

producing metallic zinc (8),

   characterized in that the concentration of zinc
in the solution (7) originating from the cementation

stage is brought to a value of at least 8 g/l to satisfy
the conditions required to obtain zinc powder in the

electrolysis stage by introducing elemental zinc after
the leaching stage, in the form of waste from iron and

steel manufacture treated to dissolve the zinc it contains,
and in that the metallic zinc (8) produced in

powder form in the electrolysis stage (III) is recycled
in its entirety or partially (8') into the cementation

stage to satisfy the requirements (5) for metallic zinc
in the said cementation stage.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said waste from iron and steel manufacture is

dust (13) from electrical steel manufacture (15).
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the electrolysis is carried out with a magnesium

electrode forming the cathode. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the electrolysis is performed with a high current

density of between 10 and 30 A/dm
2
, and preferably of the
order of 20 A/dm
2
.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the cathode in the electrolysis is subjected to

vibrations.
Decontamination process according to Claim 1, 3
or 4, characterized in that the electrolysis stage is

carried out at a temperature of 20 to 50°C and preferably
of the order of 40°C.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the stage of leaching in a basic medium is carried

out with a soda solution with a strength of 240 g/l to
300 g/l.
Process according to Claim 1 or 7, characterized
in that an injection of aqueous hydrogen peroxide is

performed during the leaching.
Process according to any one of Claims 1, 7 or 8,
characterized in that the leaching is performed at a

temperature higher than or equal to 90°C.
Process according to any one of Claims 1, 7 or 9,
characterized in that the leaching is performed in the

presence of ultrasound.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that during the stage of cementation with zinc powder

(5), the latter is added in a stoichiometric ratio of 1
to 2 to the metallic element.
