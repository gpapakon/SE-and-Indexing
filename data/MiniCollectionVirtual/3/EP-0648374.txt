<ABSTRACT>
For the overall planarisation of a semiconductor circuit or a micromechanical component with a stage between a higher and a lower region, where the areas of the regions are large, a first layer (50) is removed, and in the higher region as far as a projection (50a), a second layer (51) is removed, and then in a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) step, i.e. a grinding process, the entire arrangement is planarised.

<CLAIMS>
Global planarization process for integrated
semiconductor circuits or micromechanical components

having large-area regions of various heights and a step
to be planarized between a higher-lying region and a

lower-lying region, in which process a first layer is
applied and structured, in which process a second layer

is subsequently applied and then a polishing process is
carried out,

characterized by the following process steps:

determining the height of the step by means of a
measurement,
applying the first layer over the entire surface in a
thickness which corresponds to the measured height of

the step,
removal of the first layer in the higher-lying region
with the aid of a photolithographic procedure, the

first layer remaining only in a border area of the
higher-lying region as a rib,
applying a second layer of the material of the first
layer over the entire surface,
levelling of the entire surface assigned to the
higher-lying region and the lower-lying region with the

aid of a polishing process, in which the entire second
layer on the rib is removed and part of the second

layer in the remaining higher-lying region and lower-lying
region is removed.
Global planarization process according to Claim
1, characterized


in that a semiconductor memory arrangement with one-transistor
memory cells is used as the integrated

semiconductor circuit,
in that a periphery (P) containing a wiring is used
as the lower-lying region,
in that a cell array (Z) containing the memory cells
is used as the higher-lying region, the memory cells

having a bitline (10) arranged above the transistor and
a capacitor (11, 47, 16) arranged above the bitline,

and the capacitors being arranged on a globally
planarized first isolating layer (15), covering the

cell array (Z) and the periphery (P),
in that a dielectric is used as the first layer (50)
and as the second layer (51), and
in that the first layer (50) is deposited in a
thickness which corresponds to the height of the

capacitors (11, 47, 16).
Global planarization process according to one
of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 an etching
process selective with respect to the material of the

underlying region is used for removing the first layer
(50).
Global planarization process according to one
of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
, before
production of the capacitors (11, 47, 16), the first

isolating layer (15) is globally planarized with the
aid of a CMP step.
