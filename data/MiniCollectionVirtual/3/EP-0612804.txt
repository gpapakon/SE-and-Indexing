<ABSTRACT>
An oil-repellent fluororubber composition comprising 
a low-molecular weight tetrafluoroethylene resin with a 

peroxide crosslinked fluororubber having a Mooney viscosity 
of 90 or more ML₁+₁₀ (100°C) and, optionally, an inorganic 

filler which is a powder of a solid substance having a 
surface energy higher than that of copper, forms an oil-repellent 

fluororubber elastomer having excellent oil 
repellency and at the same time maintaining sufficiently 

the original mechanical and physical characteristics. 
Easily available materials on the market may be used and 

special means of processing and treatment are not required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oil-repellent
fluororubber composition, and, more specifically, to
an oil-repellent fluororubber composition prepared by
compounding a low-molecular weight ethylene
tetrafluoride resin to a peroxide crosslinked
fluororubber having a Mooney viscosity of 90 or more
ML1+10 (100 °C) or compounding a low-molecular weight
ethylene tetrafluoride resin and an inorganic filler
selected from the powders of solid substances having
surface energy higher than that of copper to a
peroxide crosslinked fluororubber.Conventionally, fluororubber products have been
used primarily as heat-resistant and oil-resistant
materials for oil seal components for cars,
diaphragms, tubes, hoses, gaskets and O-rings, as
packing materials for chemical resistance, as sealing
materials for ozone resistance and as wire coating
materials, their excellent heat resistance, oil
resistance, chemical resistance, solvent resistance
and high-corrosive gas resistance being utilized.
However, according to the object of use and conditions
in use, fluororubber products hardly have oil
repellency as is described hereunder and hence are
poor in oil resistance to some kinds of oils, not
showing sufficient endurance. Hence, some attempts to
impart oil repellency to fluororubber products have
been taken with a view to improving endurance, and
various methods have been proposed. The methods are
divided largely into 1) methods of modifying the
surface of a fluororubber product and 2) methods of
modifying the composition of a fluororubber 
composition.As the method 1) have been performed a treatment
according to fluorine gas, a treatment according to
chemicals having reactivity with fluororubbers and, as
a more general method, surface coating with a fluorine
resin (selected from a polytetrafluoroethylene resin,
an ethylene tetrafluoride-perfluorovinyl ether
copolymer resin, an ethylene tetrafluoride-propylene
hexafluoride copolymer resin and the like according to
temperature conditions for use).As the method 2), generally the compounding of a
powder of a fluorine resin as above to a fluororubber
is performed.In addition, the irradiation of high-energy
radiations of 10 to 30 Mrad is carried out.However, fluororubber products subjected to a
surface treatment come to lose oil repellency due to
the breakage and peeling of the surface layer caused
by repeated loading in use (compression, abrasion,
extension, etc.). On the other hand, products from
the composition with only a fluorine resin powder
compounded therein do not lose
