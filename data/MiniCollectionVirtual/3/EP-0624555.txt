<ABSTRACT>
A process for the treatment of caustic sulfide liquor by 
wet oxidation in a ferrous-based alloy system at 

temperatures less than about 175°C is described. The 
liquor is first analyzed for alkalinity consuming species 

and for nonsulfidic alkalinity. If excess alkalinity 
consuming species is present compared to nonsulfidic 

alkalinity, then additional nonsulfidic alkalinity is 
added to the raw liquor such that excess alkalinity is 

present during the wet oxidation treatment, thus 
preventing excess corrosion to the ferrous-based alloy 

system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for treatment of
caustic sulfide liquor by wet oxidation, and more particularly
to treatment of the liquor in a ferrous-based alloy wet
oxidation system.Caustic sulfide liquors are generated in a variety of
processes from a number of industrial sources. These caustic
liquors are commonly used to remove acidic components from
various gas streams by scrubbing or from liquid streams by
extraction. The gas streams are generated in the
petrochemical industry, petroleum refining, pulp and paper
manufacture and various chemical manufacturing processes. The
acidic components include hydrogen sulfide, H2S, mercaptans,
RSH, and possibly organic acids. Analysis of caustic sulfide
liquors for acidic components, as well as metal
carbonates/bicarbonates and caustic soda, is described by J.W.
McCoy in Chemical Analysis of Industrial Water, Chemical
Publishing Co., New York, 1969. See particularly pages 125-153.The contaminated caustic liquors represent a formidable
disposal problem due to their caustic content as well as the
captured acidic components therein. Neutralization of the
caustic liquor by acid addition can result in release of the
acidic components. Therefore it is essential to convert the
captured acidic components to a form suitable for release to 
the environment. Further, there may be additional components
present in the caustic liquor which add to the Chemical Oxygen
Demand (COD) of the liquor. These components include various
carbonaceous materials including phenolics, organic acids and
oils.Wet oxidation is the preferred method of treatment for
caustic sulfide liquors since the products of oxidation are
inorganic sulfate, carbon dioxide and water. Also, the
oxidation is carried out within a closed system which prevents
transfer of pollutants to the atmosphere. The highly alkaline
nature of these caustic liquors requires special materials of
construction for wet oxidation systems employed in their
treatment. The nickel-based alloys, such as Inconel 600, are
well suited to withstand the elevated temperatures and
pressures employed in the wet oxidation process for caustic
liquor treatment. The ferrous-based alloys, such as carbon
steel, stainless steel, or superstainless steel may be
considered for wet oxidation treatment of caustic wastewaters.
However, under wet oxidation conditions, corrosion is a
serious problem for these alloys. Ferrous-based alloys shall
be defined as those containing a majority of iron, at least
50%.US-A-3,761,409 discloses a continuous process

<CLAIMS>
A process for treatment of a caustic sulfide liquor by wet
oxidation in a wet oxidation system constructed of a ferrous-based

alloy (hereinafter referred to as a ferrous-based alloy wet
oxidation system) comprising the steps:


a) analysing the caustic sulfide liquor to determine the
initial concentrations therein of total alkalinity, total

sulfides, mercaptans, COD, thiosulfate, total carbonate and
pH, and determining from the results of this analysis the

amount of nonsulfidic alkalinity which would be consumed by
said liquor upon wet oxidation treatment and the amount of

nonsulfidic alkalinity initially available in said liquor;
b) adding a sufficient amount of additional nonsulfidic
alkalinity to said caustic sulfide liquor such that the sum

of the initially available nonsulfidic alkalinity and said
additional nonsulfidic alkalinity exceeds the amount of

nonsulfidic alkalinity which will be consumed upon wet
oxidation treatment as determined in step (a); and
c) carrying out said treatment process of wet oxidation
upon said caustic sulfide liquor within said ferrous-based

alloy wet oxidation system at temperatures less than 175°C
to destroy sulfides and mercaptans and produce a treated

liquor containing excess nonsulfidic alkalinity.
A process according to claim 1 wherein said caustic sulfide
liquor is produced from a scrubbing process.
A process according to claim 1 wherein said caustic sulfide
liquor is produced from an extraction process. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein said additional
nonsulfidic alkalinity is added to said liquor in the form of

alkali metal hydroxide.
A process according to claim 1 wherein said additional
nonsulfidic alkalinity is added to said liquor in the form of

alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the pH range for
said treated liquor is between 8 and 14.
