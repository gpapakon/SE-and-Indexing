<ABSTRACT>
Crash-helmet for cyclists and for non motor sports in general, 
comprising a first cap (1) of foamed polystyrene provided with slots (3) 

and cavities (4) for the circulation of air and with raised zones (5) at 
least at the opposite sides of the cap (1), and a second cap (2) or 

rigid plastic material, substantially polycarbonate, provided also with 
slots (6) placed at least in part in correspondence of those of the 

first cap (1), and with large openings (7) at the opposite sides, 
permitting the coupling of said two caps (1,2) by snap-fitting of the 

raised zone (5) of the polystyrene cap (1) into said large openings (7) 
of the second cap (2) of rigid material. 
In said cap (1) of foamed polystyrene, housings (19) are also 
provided suitable for holding the fasteners (11) of the chin-strap (17), 

which can be inserted in such a way as to permit to the second cap (2) 
to hold said fasteners (11) in stable position within said 

housings (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
Object of the invention is a crash-helmet especially 
fit for cyclists and sportspeople who practice sports 
requiring physical effort, whose structure offers a 
high resistance to accidental hittings. As known, the main function of crash-helmets for cyclists 
and sportspeople who practice sports involving 
dangers of damages due to falls, accidental hittings 
and the like, is to develop an efficacious activity of 
protection of the head of the user, and in particular 
of the skull, ensuring at the same time an efficient 
aeration of the head. Besides, as is also known, helmets for cyclists must be 
very light and are therefore usually made of materials 
such as foamed polystyrene or the like. These helmets are usually shaped as a cap, which cap is 
provided with holes or slits to let the ventilation air 
enter, to the purpose of a correct distribution of the 
air within said cap. To hold correctly in place these helmets, straps or 
chin-straps are utilized which are variously fixed to 
the two opposite side faces of the cap; in some cases, 
said chin-straps are directly fixed in the inside of 
the helmet by means of rivets or the like or by means 
of pins buried in the thickness of the cap; in other  
 
cases, two through-slits are made in the cap, parallel 
to one another, in one of which the strap is inserted 
from the inside towards the outside and then reintroduced 
in the cap through the other slit. A particular and highly reliable system for fastening 
chin-straps is disclosed in a co-pending patent application 
on behalf of the same Applicant; said system 
provides for a small frame having the shape of an angle 
with eyelets for keeping a strap-holding bar inserted 
in said eyelets; said frame fits into a suitable housing 
provided on both sides of the protection cap. It is also known that, to improve the aesthetical 
appearance of cyclist helmets and in some cases to try 
to increase the shock-resistance, some solutions have 
been proposed that provide, for instance, the covering 
of the cap with a second cap of light plastic material 
and the fastening of the latter to the underlying cap 
of foamed polystyrene by means of tape or gummed tape 
placed around the whole circumference of the peripheral 
edge of said lighter cap; in other cases, the polystyrene 
of the protective cap is directly expanded within 
the covering lighter cap, so as to obtain a one-piece 
helmet. The crash-helmets of the type described hereinabove 
have however some severe drawbacks and disadvantages, 
as concerns their

<CLAIMS>
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sportspeople in general, 
of the type shaped as a rigid cap of plastic 

material, characterized in that it comprises: 

a first protection cap of foamed polystyrene provided 
with a plurality of grooves, cavities and slots, to let 

in the air necessary to create an adequate ventilation 
within the cap, as well as with housings and slits 

provided on two opposite sides of said cap for holding 
the fasteners of the chin-straps, and at least two 

large raised zones on the opposite external sides of 
said cap; 
a second cap or reinforcement shell of rigid plastic 
material, so shaped and sized as to fit on to the 

protection cap through snap-fitting on the large slots 
provided in it on said raised zones emerging from said 

first protection cap, and 
a plurality of slots and cavities, provided on said 
reinforcement cap in positions corresponding at least 

partly to the cavities and slots of said protection 
cap, to permit the passage and the distribution of air 

from the outside to the inside of the helmet, said 
reinforcement cap being also a means for holding said 

chin-strap fasteners in their housing. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said second reinforcement cap is made of rigid 

plastic material such as polycarbonate. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said second reinforcement cap is so sized as to 

stop against the peripheral edge of the base of the 
underlying cap, once the coupling is complete. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 1, characterized in 
that on the opposite sides of said first cap of foamed 

polystyrene a housing is provided suitable to house the 
chin-strap fasteners, so as to permit to said second 

external cap to hold said fasteners in stable position 
in their housings. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 4, characterized in 
that said chin-strap fasteners comprise a small frame 

constituted by an angle with two flanges placed at 90Â° 
to one another and forming an isosceles triangle, two 

coinciding axis holed cylinders being fixed between 
said two flanges, a pin suitable to house a loop or 

eyelet of a chin-strap being inserted in to said opposite 
holes. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 5, characterized in 
that said pin is provided on one end with a slightly 

 
protruding head suitable to be housed in a corresponding 

recess provided in one of the cylinders and with a 
slit on the opposite end suitable to make elastically 

yielding said end causing the latter to be press-heldable 
in the hole provided in the other opposite 

cylinder.
