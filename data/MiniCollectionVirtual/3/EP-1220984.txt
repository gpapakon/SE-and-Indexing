<ABSTRACT>
An air resonator for an air intake system includes a plurality of serially positioned increasing volume chambers (3, 5, 9, 11). Air passing to the engine passes through these chambers. Noise passing from the engine back towards the source of air will also pass through these increasing volume chambers. As the noise serially passes through the increasing and then decreasing volume, the noise is dissipated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air resonator assembly for use in reducing noise
adjacent to a vehicle engine wherein the air passes through a plurality of expanding and
contracting chambers.Vehicle engines are subject to a good deal of engineering effort. One major
effort is to reduce the noise associated with an engine. An engine typically has an air
supply system that communicates a source of air to the engine. This air supply system
is also a source of noise, in that noise tends to travel back upstream towards the source
of air from the engine. Thus, the air intake systems for engines are typically provided
for a resonator assembly. The goal of resonator assemblies as used in the prior art is to
reduce the engine noise to the extent possible.Whilst known air resonator systems have reduced the engine noise somewhat, it
would still be desirable to further reduce engine noise. Typically, known resonator
systems include a single chamber which communicates with the air supply to provide a
chamber for dissipating engine noise.US 1,611,475 discloses a silencer having a number of chambers each having a
cross-section which varies along the flow path.The present invention discloses a system wherein the air flow and thus the
engine noise each experience a series of expanding and contracting chambers.In the disclosed embodiment of this invention, a resonator chamber is placed
between a source of air and a vehicle engine. Air passes through the resonator chamber
to the engine, and noise from the engine passes back through the chamber toward the
source of air. The resonator chamber is preferably formed of a plurality of chambers
which are of changing volume. Preferably, the engine noise passes into a chamber of
relatively large volume which converges to a smaller volume. The noise then passes
through a first chamber port of the first chamber and then into another enlarged volume
which is again reduced. Air on the other hand enters into the chambers at a smaller area 
and moves towards a larger volume before passing through the ports. As known, the air
passes in an opposed direction relative to the noise. The noise is repeatedly dissipated
by the serially encountered expanding chambers.In one disclosed embodiment the resonator is relatively flat, and formed of a
plurality of wedge-shaped chambers. The air flow moves to one end of the resonator
through a plurality of expanding volume wedge-shaped chambers and then back in an
opposed direction through a second plurality of expanding wedge-shaped chambers.
