<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for dissolving CO2 gas in water to produce carbonized water in a storage tank fitted with refridgeration pipes forming part of a refridgeration circuit designed to cool the contents and to form a shroud of ice in the region of the tank walls. The invention calls for means to be fitted in the vicinity of the walls cooled by the refridgeration pipes of the refridgeration circuit to ensure local ice formation in some areas and not in others.

<CLAIMS>
Device for enriching water with CO
2
 gas to produce
carbonated water in a storage tank (1), which is provided

with cooling pipes (9) of a cooling circuit to cool the

contents of the storage tank (1) and to form an ice shell
(10) in the wall area, in whose interior a circulating

pump (5) is placed, by which CO
2
 gas from the head area of
the storage tank (1) is mixed with the water and/or the

water inside the storage tank (1) is put in rotation
and/or circulation, and in which both water and CO
2
 gas
can be fed to the head area and removed from the

carbonated water in the bottom area, 
characterized

in that structural measures for specific
local ice formation preferred over the other areas are

taken in the storage tank (1) in the area of its wall
provided with the cooling pipes (9) of the cooling

circuit, which measures being different from the cooling
pipes (9).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that a space
for the contents of the storage tank (1) is separated as a

measure for the preferred local ice formation in the storage
tank (1) in the immediate vicinity of its cooling pipe

(9), space which is deficient in flow or without flow and
open toward the interior of the storage tank (1).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the
space separated in the interior of the storage tank is

smaller than 100 mm
3
.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the
space separated in the interior of the storage tank is

smaller than 10 mm
3
. 
Device according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterized
in that the space stabilised with respect to flow

in the interior of the storage tank is formed by a pipe
(13) mounted to the wall of the storage tank in the area

of the cooling pipe.
Device according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterized
in that the space stabilised with respect to flow

is formed by a projection (12'') of the wall of the storage
tank (1) directed outward between two cooling pipe

coils and a plate covering this projection to the greatest
possible extent relative to the interior of the storage

tank.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
wall of the storage tank (1) is at least partially

roughened relative to the interior of the storage tank in
the upper area preferably provided with the cooling pipe

and otherwise is made smooth especially in the lower area
of the storage tank.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the measures for specific local ice

formation, preferred relative to the other areas, are
taken in the lower area of the cooling pipes (9) on the

wall of the storage tank (1).
