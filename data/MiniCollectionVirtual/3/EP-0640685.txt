<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cell strain capable of 
separating and multiplying an EB virus and derived from human 

lymphocyte cancer cells and a method of separating and 
multiplying the EB virus by means of said cell strain. The 

present cell strain can be applied to the separation and 
multiplication of the wild type virus present in various places, 

as well as to the separation and multiplication of the virus 
produced by homologous recombination etc. The virus newly 

separated and multiplied can be applied to vaccine etc. For the 
more efficient separation and multiplication of the virus, 

several markers can be inserted into the present cell strain.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cell strain applicable to
viral diagnosis etc. of an Epstein-Barr virus (hereinafter
referred to as "EB virus") and capable of effectively separating
and multiplying the EB virus conventionally difficult to separate
and multiply and a method of separating and multiplying the EB
virus by means of said cell strain.The EB virus infects umbilical cord blood lymphocyte or
peripheral blood lymphocyte to transform the cells. However, the
EB virus generally infects cells to remain merely latent, so the
infected cells hardly produce mature viruses. Although B
lymphocyte cell strains (BJAR, Ramos, etc.) uninfected with the
EB virus can be infected with the EB virus to continuously carry
it, such strains cannot produce a large amount of EB virus
(Fields, B.N. and D.M. Knipe (ed.), 1990, Virology, 2nd ed. Raven
press, New York: Chapter 68, Epstein-Barr Virus, Biology,
pathogenesis, and medical aspects, G. Miller, pp. 1921-1957).Cells such as Akata, B95-8, P3HR1, etc., are known as EB
virus-producing cells. In particular, Akata cells treated with 
anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies produce a large amount of EB
virus (Takada K, Int. J. Cancer, 33, 27-32 (1984) and Takada, K.
and Ono Y, J. Virol. 63, 445-449 (1989)). However, these cells
are those already infected with the EB virus, and merely produce
the EB virus that has already infected, and there is no report on
the use of these cells to effectively separate and multiply
extracellular EB viruses.In addition, there are reports on investigations into the
separation and multiplication of EB virus by means of BJAB, BL30,
BL41 and Loukes, i.e. EB virus-negative B-lymphocyte cancer cells
(A. Marchini, R. Longnecker and E. Kieff, J. Virol. 66, 4972-4981
(Aug. 1992)). For production of EB virus, however, these cells
should be induced with a chemical substance such as 5-AZACYTIDINE,
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) etc. or
with a special plasmid (pSVNaeZ), so that there are problems such
as the harmful influence (safety) of the chemical substance on
the human body, the poor efficiency of plasmid induction, etc.,
and such a cell strain for separation and multiplication of EB
virus is not satisfactory in respect of the separated and
multiplied viral amount. 
Further, the four different cell lines (BJAB, BL30, BL41 and
Loukes) disclosed in this document are useful for isolating and
propagating mutant EBV recombinants. The mutant recombinants
obtained by using these cell lines are products of a homologous
recombination event
