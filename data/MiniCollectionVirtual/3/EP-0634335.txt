<ABSTRACT>
A foot for the palletization of cartons comprising two 
elements (11, 12) superimposed so as to grip a part of 

a flap (14') of a carton bottom and block it firmly by 
means of a screw (13) piercing the carton, resting on 

an element (12) at one side and screwed to the other 
element (11) at the opposite end, said elements (11, 

12) and the screw being made in plastic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns palletization of 
cartons in general, and more particularly feet 
applicable to cartons for such palletization. In practice, palletization of cartons is getting 
more and more widespread for direct handling by means 
of ordinary fork-lift and translation devices, with no 
need for any pallets or supporting platforms. 
Palletization is performed by applying detachable 
supporting feet to the bottom of each carton when using 
it, with the possibility of recovering and recycling 
carton and feet separately. At present, feet may be applied to a carton by 
means of a bayonet cap or by providing each foot with a  
 
neck designed to be introduced into a hole provided in 
the carton and blocked therein by means of an element 
coupled to the neck by pressure or in any other way. In 
any case however, cartons require adequate prior 
punching so as to be provided with the openings 
designed to receive the feet. Moreover, said feet are 
fixed only on a limited area corresponding to the edges 
of said openings, sometimes in unstable condition, and 
may accidentally come off. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a foot which may be removably applied to a carton to be 
palletized thus permitting separate recycling of 
cartons and feet, and which rests on a large surface so 
as to remain steadily fixed thereto with no need for 
any prior punching. Such object is achieved by a new, original 
embodiment of a foot comprising two elements designed 
to be superimposed so as to grip part of a flap of a 
carton bottom, which is firmly blocked by means of a 
screw pin piercing the carton, resting on an element at 
one end and screwed to the other element at the 
opposite end. Further details will however become apparent from 
the continuation of the description of the invention, 
illustrated only by way of non-limitative example with  
 
reference to the accompanying drawings showing a 
practical embodiment of the foot, in which: 
Figure 1 shows the components of a foot according to 
the invention, separately Figure 2 shows a sectional view of the foot applied to 
the bottom of a carton Figure 3 shows a palletized carton. The foot according to the invention essentially 
comprises plastic components such as a body 11, a plate 
12 and a screw pin 13. The body 11 may be prism-shaped 
and constitutes the real foot, designed to define, with 
other feet, adequate supports for the palletization of 
a carton 14. The body 11 may be provided with a 
relieving cavity open downwards and

<CLAIMS>
A foot for palletization of cartons characterized 
in that it comprises two elements (11, 12) superimposed 

so as to grip a part of a flap (14') of a carton bottom 
and block it firmly by means of a screw (13) piercing 

the carton, resting on an element (12) at one end and 
screwed to the other element (11) at the other end, 

such elements (11, 12) and the screw being in plastic 
material. 
A foot as claimed in claim 1 which comprises a 
hollow prismatic body (11) having a horizontal top wall 

(15) provided with a threaded hole (16); a plate (12) 
articulated to a side of said body which extends above 

the top wall (15) so that they define a pocket (20) 
designed to receive the carton flap (14') to which the 

foot is applied and provided with a hole (21) 
coinciding with the threaded hole (16) in said top wall 

(15); and a screw pin (13) provided with a piercing end 
(22) and a large head (23), said screw pin (13) passing 

through the hole (21) of the plate (12) and through the 
carton introduced in said pocket (20) after piercing it 

and being screwed down in the threaded hole (16) of the 
top wall of said body (11) so as to rest on said plate 

with its head (23). 
A foot as claimed in claim 2, wherein said plate 
(12) is separably articulated to said body (11). 
A foot as claimed in claim 3 wherein said plate 
(12) is supplied with a square-shaped fin (18) designed 

to be introduced into a corresponding slit (19) 
provided in the top wall (15), said fin having an 

intermediate shoulder (18') which limits penetration 
thereof into said slit (19) and permits spacing between 

such plate and said top wall in order to define a 
pocket (20). 
A foot as claimed in the previous claims, wherein 
pointed projections (17) are provided on the outside 

surface of such top wall (15). 
A foot as claimed in the previous claims wherein 
a hexagonal hole for a wrench is provided at the centre 

of the head of the screw pin (13).
