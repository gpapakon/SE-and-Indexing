<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for protecting a needle (6) in medical equipment. It has a rigid front part (10) connected to a flexible rear part (12). The front and rear parts surround the needle (6) circumferentially. A locking means (36) is accommodated in a chamber (24) provided in the front part (10). In a position of preparedness, the locking means allows the needle (6) to pass through a hole or a channel (14) in the front part (10) and, in an activated position, prevents the needle (6) from passing through. In the position  of preparedness, the parts (10, 12) are spaced from the tip of the needle (6). The novelty of the invention is that the locking means (36) is a resilient member which in the position of preparedness is maintained under tension, exerting a force substantially at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the needle (6), that at least the tip of the needle (6) in the position of preparedness is supported by the hole or the channel (14), the resilient member (36) being thus maintained under tension, and that the resilient member (36), after passing from the position of preparedness to the activated position when the needle (6) is moved rearwards relative to the front part (10), prevents the needle (6) from passing through the hole or the channel (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a device
for use in infusion cannulas, and more specifically to a
device for protecting a needle or the tip of a needle used
in such contexts.The existence of contagious or infectious diseases,
such as Aids and hepatitis B, which via the blood, other
body fluids or tissue parts can infect the nursing staff,
makes the treatment/care of patients extremely hazardous,
since each patient must be regarded as a potential
infection source.Since the discovery of HIV, many people in the
health service, ambulance personnel, nurses, doctors
and others have been infected, e.g. by body contact with
or accidental pricking by infected needles which have
been used in the treatment of blood-infected patients.To protect the nursing staff who is directly involved
in the care of such highly infectious patients, extensive
efforts have been used for developing syringes and infusion
cannulas, as well as protection devices for use in
such syringes and infusion cannulas, with a view to preventing
direct contact with infected needles and safeguarding
against accidental needle pricking.One example of such a device is disclosed in US-A-4,725,267,
in which a spring-biased needle tip protection
means is moved forwards over the needle tip after the
needle has been used. The spring actuating the protection
device may be integrated with a flexible tube which
prevents direct contact with the end of the needle remote
from the needle tip.Another example of a protection device of the above-mentioned
type is disclosed in DE-A1-38 08 688. A needle
tip protection means connected to a flexible tube is
moved forwards over the needle after this has been used,
and is so angled as to bring the needle tip into a clamped
position inside the protection device. The flexible tube is
then pulled over the end portion of the needle remote
from the needle tip.Further, protection devices are known in the art
which have no flexible tube, but yet cover, that is surround,
the entire needle. One example of such a device
is illustrated in US-A-4,850,994, in which a rigid sleeve-shaped
member, which is movable in the longitudinal
direction of the needle, is moved, after the needle has
been used, over the needle, which then is completely
surrounded by the sleeve-shaped member in spaced-apart
relationship thereto.US-A-4,955,866 disdoses a needle tip protection
means which is in the form of a cylindrical part surrounding
the needle. The cylindrical part is fixed, e.g. by a
thread, to the end of the needle remote from the

<CLAIMS>
A device for protecting a needle (6) in medical equipment (2), especially after using this
equipment, having a rigid front part (10) with a chamber (16, 24) provided therein, said

front part being connected to a flexible rear part (12), said front and rear parts, when in a
position of preparedness, being spaced from the tip (8) of the needle (6) and surrounding

the needle circumferentially, wherein at least the tip (8) of the needle in said position of
preparedness is supported by a hole or channel (14) in the front part (10), the device

accommodating a needle locking means (26, 36, 46) which in a position of preparedness
allows the needle (6) to pass through the hole or channel (14) in said front part (10) and

which in an activated position prevents the needle (6) from passing through,

the locking means being accommodated in the chamber (16, 24) and being a resilient
member (26, 36, 46) which in said position of preparedness is under tension, exerting a

force on the needle (6) substantially at right-angles to the longitudinal direction of the
needle (6), and wherein the resilient member (26, 36, 46), after passing from the

position of preparedness to the activated position when the needle (6) is moved
rearwards relative to the front part (10), prevents the needle (6) from passing through

said hole or channel (14), the rear, flexible part (12) of the device being connected to a
mount (4) for the needle (6);

characterised in that;

the resilient member is compressible in an axial direction perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the needle and is under compression in the position of preparedness;

and
the front part (10) of the device has circumferentially spaced elastic fingers (54)
extended in the longitudinal direction of the device and are provided with a bead or a

lug extending substantially inwards towards the axis of the device for engaging a
catheter unit, the elastic fingers and bead or lug (52, 54) being detachable from the 

catheter unit by the application of an additional tractive force on a casing (18) attached
to the mount (4) of the needle (6) and surrounding the rear part (12), when the rear part

Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that each finger (54) and the lug
or bead (52) are adapted to engage an annular flange (56) of the catheter unit.
Device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the casing (18) has
such an inner diameter and such an extent in the longitudinal direction that, in the

position of preparedness, i.e. before use, it encloses the front part (10) so as to further
