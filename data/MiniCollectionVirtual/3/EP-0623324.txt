<ABSTRACT>
The impacting device is used to manipulate the stem of endoprostheses made or steel or a fibre composite having a smooth conical or cylindrical proximal end. For anchorage, conventional impacting devices require a positive connection to the prosthesis end or else their bulky construction restricts their use in a narrow wound. The novel device is exclusively connected to the prosthesis end by frictional engagement and can even be handled easily in a narrow wound due to its extremely compact design. The cylindrical grip head (2) with the clamping ring (8) mounted therein is attached to the prosthetic cone (16) and braced by cheese head screws (7). At the same time, the clamping ring (8) is radially compressed via the double cone (9), and the frictional engagement with the prosthetic cone (16) is thereby produced. The axially parallel arrangement of the cylindrical bolt (13) relative to the axis of the prosthetic stem (18) and the slight coaxial offset of the two axes permit insertion and extraction of the prosthesis (1) virtually without transverse forces and in a manner that is not damaging for bone.

Driving-out device to remove and to drive in shaft endoprostheses

(1)
 having a smooth conical or cylindrical proximal end 
(16),

consisting of a conical clamping device, allowing to establish a
friction-locking connection to the proximal end 
(16)
 of the endoprosthesis

(1),
 where the clamping device is consisting of a cylindrical
chucking head 
(2)
 with an inlaid clamping ring 
(8),
 which
with its inner surface can be brought into position of the proximal

end 
(16)
 of the endo-prosthesis 
(1)
 and where, by means of the
chucking head 
(2),
 the clamping ring 
(8)
 can be compressed radially,

characterized thereby
 that on the surface of its outer casing, the
clamping ring 
(8)
 is disposing of a double cone 
(9)
 and that the chucking
head 
(2)
 is disposing of a pressure flange 
(10)
 provided with
an inner cone and of a chucking ring 
(11),
 also provided with an
inner cone, whereby the inner cones of the pressure flange 
(10)
 and
of the chucking ring 
(11)
 have a common effect together with the
double cone 
(9)
 of the clamping ring 
(8),
 whereby the clamping ring

(8)
 can be chucked and be radially compressed from two sides.
Driving-out device as per claim 1, 
characterized thereby
 that the
clamping ring 
(8)
 is seated backlash-free together with the double
cone 
(9)
 in the corresponding inner cones of the pressure flange

(10)
 and of the chucking ring 
(11).
Driving-out device as per claims 1 and 2, 
characterized thereby

that during the chucking process, the clamping ring 
(8)
 is seated
unremoveably in axial directions.
Driving-out device as per one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
thereby
 that the clamping ring 
(8)
 can consist of steel, or of a nonferrous
metal or of a plastic material and that it can be slotted

axially.
Driving-out device as per one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
thereby,
 that for determination and securing of the necessary prechucking
force, cylinder-head screws 
(7)
 with underlaid strain
washers 
(12)
 are arranged at the chucking head 
(2).
Driving-out device as per one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
thereby,
 that a cylindrical rod 
(3)
 is coordinated with the chucking
head 
(2)
 serving to absorb the impacting pulses created by the
driving-out weight 
(4).
Driving-out device as per the claim 6, 
characterized thereby,

that in lieu of the cylindrical rod 
(3),
 a cylindrical bolt 
(13)

with an absorption surface 
(15)
 is coordinated to the chucking head

(2),
 with which the driving-out appliance can also be used as a
driving-in appliance.
