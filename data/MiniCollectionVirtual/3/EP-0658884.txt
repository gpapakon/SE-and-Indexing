<ABSTRACT>
An optical recording/reproducing apparatus 
includes an irradiation optical system for irradiating 

a light beam from a light source onto a predetermined 
track of an optical recording medium having a plurality 

of neighboring tracks as a fine light spot so as to 
perform recording/reproduction of information or 

reproduction of information, and a detection optical 
system for detecting a returned light beam from the 

optical recording medium. A mask is arranged in a far 
field region sufficiently separated from a focal plane 

of the detection optical system, for masking marginal 
rays, in a direction perpendicular to the track, of the 

returned light beam, so that information reproduced 
from a track adjacent to the predetermined track upon 

reproduction of information on the predetermined track 
is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
recording/reproduction apparatus for
recording/reproducing information on/from or
reproducing information from an optical disc, a
magneto-optical disc, or the like and, more
particularly, to an optical arrangement which reduces
crosstalk from an adjacent track and intersymbol
interaction from an adjacent mark by inserting an
aperture in the pupil or the far field region of a
detection optical system for detecting a returned light
beam from an optical disc so as to prevent marginal
rays from becoming incident on a photodetector.In recent years, various optical memories which
perform recording/reproduction using a semiconductor
laser beam have been placed on the market, and in
particular, magneto-optical recording/reproduction
apparatuses which can rewrite information are
considered to be promising.A magneto-optical recording/reproduction apparatus
magnetically records information by utilizing a local
temperature rise of a magnetic thin film upon spot
irradiation of a laser beam, and reproduces information 
by a magneto-optical effect (Kerr effect). Recently,
as the information amount to be processed by, e.g., a
computer has increased, a further increase in density
of the magneto-optical recording/reproduction apparatus
has been studied. In order to increase the density,
the interval between two adjacent recording tracks is
decreased, the length of each recorded mark is
shortened, or mark edge recording is adopted in place
of mark position recording. On the other hand, in an
optical head as well, the wavelength of a laser beam is
reduced to decrease the light spot diameter, or the
super-resolution is used so as to increase the density.An optical system of an optical head using the
super-resolution in a conventional optical
recording/reproduction apparatus will be described
below.An example of application of the super-resolution
to a light spot on an optical disc using an annular
aperture described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. 56-116004 will be described below with
reference to Fig. 1. A light beam emitted from a
semiconductor laser 1 is collimated by a collimator
lens 2, and is then incident on a beam splitter 3. The
light beam transmitted through the beam splitter 3
forms a fine light spot 9 on a magneto-optical disc 5
by an objective lens 4 via an annular aperture 8. The
annular aperture is constituted by arranging a circular 
mask (diameter ε) at the central portion of a normal
circular aperture (diameter A). Returned light from
