<
2.0 % in the hard state after hardening and tempering and 
in its micro-structure, contains either or both of M₆C and 

M₂C type carbides representing a ratio of 0 to 2 % to the

type carbide. The difference of crystallization temperatures 
is 30 °C or more between MC type carbide and M₆C or M₂C type 

eutectic carbide.

small anisotropy of the mechanical properties, namely, a 

hardness of HRC 60 or more and a Charpy impact value ratio 
between the longitudinal direction and the direction 

perpendicular thereto in a forged material is 0.7 or more, 
and is quite useful for plastic working.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-speed steel member 
with a high toughness used for plastic working and a manufacturing 
method thereof. The steel referred to as high-speed steel has a micro-structure 
containing two forms of primary carbide. One is a 
complex carbide called M₆C or M₂C, whose crystal structure 
constitutes cubic system with a composition of Fe₃(W, Mo)₃C or 
Fe₄(W, Mo)₂C. The other is a mono carbide called MC with a 
composition of (V, Ti, Nb)C. The former is formed as 
herringborn-like or feather-like eutectic carbides obtained in 
eutectic reaction during solidification process of molten steel 
where austenite (γ ) and M₆C (M₂C) type carbides are 
simultaneously crystallized from melt (L). In case of the 
latter, crystallization style is a little complicated: The MC 
type carbide may be formed in two solidification types, one is 
crystrallized alone in the melt (L) and the other is formed 
during eutectic reaction. The MC type carbide crystallized alone 
is first formed as a single type crystal from the melt (L) in 
solidification process. Then, in the eutectic reaction where 
austenite (γ) and MC type carbide are simultaneously 
crystallized from the melt (L), MC type carbide may be formed 
again. In case of ordinary high-speed steel, M₆C (M₂C) type  
 
carbide, which is an eutectic carbide, is generated much more 
than MC type carbide, which is crystallized alone, of the above 
primary carbides. Besides, M₆C (M₂C) type carbides are always 
generated in eutectic reactions under general industrial 
conditions for ingot making and cannot be crystallized alone. 
According to Steven (G.S. Steven, A.E. Nehrenberg: Trans, 
ASM57(1967) p.925), the eutectic temperature here can be 
expressed in weight % of the elements as shown below:

Formula:   TM₆C (°F) = 2310-200(%C)+40(%V)+8(%W)+5(%Mo).....When the crystallization temperature difference between MC 
type carbide and the M₆C(M₂C) type eutectic carbides is 
expressed as ΔT(°C), the more V, Si, N and C are contained and 
the less W and Mo are included in a steel, the larger the 
difference ΔT(°C) becomes. In general, higher ΔT(°C) involves 
more coarse MC type carbide, which lowers steel grindability. To provide the structure with a finer MC type carbide, it is 
proposed to decrease the crystallization temperature difference 
between MC type carbide and M₆C (M₂C) type carbide by adjusting 
the alloying elements (Electric Steel Making, vol. 55, No. 4, 
1984, p.225). According to a conventional method to improve the 
grindability of
