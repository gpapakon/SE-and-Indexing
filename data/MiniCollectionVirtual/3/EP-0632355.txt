of the engine, generates equal number of pulses to the number 
of rotation, a detector which detects the tilt angle of a swash 

plate of the pump, a detector which detects the operating 
displacement of the actuator, a detector which detects the load 

pressure acting on the pump, and a controll unit which 
controls a target discharge flow amount of the pump which is

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a discharge flow control
system and method of a hydraulic pump in hydraulic
equipment such as excavator, loader, dozer, crane, etc., and
more particularly to a discharge flow control system and
method to make the hydraulic pump to discharge a fairly
precise amount of flow required for a desired workIn recent years, with the developement of electronic control
unit such as microprocessors, the hydraulic system,
particularly in heavy construction equipment, incoporates the
electronic devices for automation.The fundamental technologies required in the automation of
construction equipment such as excavator include a position
control technology for various moving parts, and an energy 
minimization technology for preventing flow loss.The most general way which has been used for the
enhancement of the operation efficiency of equipment and for
the precise position control is to compare the flow amount
required by an operator with the tilt angle data of the swash
plate in hydraulic pump by a tilt angle detecting means, and
compensate for errors therebetween.Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of hydraulic system in
a conventional excavator.As shown in Fig. 1, the hydraulic system has an engine 1
which serves as a power source, two variable displacement
pumps 2 and 3 and an auxilliary pump 4 for discharging a
constant amount of operating oil, two pump requlators 5 and 6
for controlling each pump by moving each swash plate in
pumps 2 and 3, solenoid controlled proportional valves 7 and 8
for pumps 2. and 3 to generate a pilot pressure proportional to
an input signal by the operating oil supplied from auxilliary
pump 4 and to provide the pilot pressure to pump requlators 5
and 6, at least one or more hydraulic actuators 9, 10 and 11
which are driven by a discharge flow of pumps 2 and 3, a
flow control valve 12 to control the direction and the amount
of flow between actuators 9, 10 and 11 and pumps 2 and 3 by
the displacement of a spool therein, and a solenoid controlled
proportional valve 13 generating a pilot pressure for flow
control valve 12. However, the conventional system described in the above has the drawbacks
that a frequent operation error occurs due to hysterisis characteristics of the
solenoid controlled proportional valves, and that a precise control of the
discharge flow amount is difficult due to the variable efficiency of the pumps.The document FR-A-2 677 407 discloses a system for controlling a discharge
flow amount of a hydraulic pump without the characterizing means
