<ABSTRACT>
An object of the invention is to provide an apparatus which is simple in construction without the need of any 
power supply and the like and is capable of easily and positively getting an umbrella received into an umbrella cover, 

and an umbrella cover suitable for the apparatus. To this end, the apparatus for getting an umbralla received into an 
umbrella cover according to the invention comprises a body (1) for receiving a plurality of umbrella covers (5), a 

movable support plate (11) vertically movable provided in the body (1), a bearing plate (25) for moving the movable 
support plate downward when the ferrule of an umbrella to be received in the cover (5) abuts against the bearing plate, 

and an opening operating lever (28) for opening the opening portion of the umbrella cover (5) by interlocking with 
the downward movement of the movable support plate (11). With the arrangement, the ferrule o
f an umbrella to be 
received in the cover (5) is caused to abut against the bearing plate to move the movable support plate (11) downward 

whereby the opening operating lever (28) is actuated to open the opening portion of the umbrella cover (5) and at the 
same time the bearing plate (25) is swingingly retracted downward to permit the umbrella to be automatically inserted 

into the umbrella cover (5). As a result, it is possible according to the invention to easily get an umbrella received 
into an umbrella cover in a single action without the use of a motor and the like. Moreover, it is possible to reduce 

manufacturing cost and to use the present apparatus even in a place where any power supply is not available. Besides, 
the present apparatus is quite practical because any power cable does not interfere with our movements and there is 

no fear of leakage of electricity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a storage device
for wet umbrellas that automatically wraps the umbrellas
and places them in sacks. It can be used, for example,
at entrances of hotels, shops and department stores, so
that when it is raining, the umbrellas can be adequately
handled and stored.When it is raining, synthetic resin sacks (plastic
sacks) have traditionally been used to wrap wet
umbrellas in order to avoid wetting clothes, floors or
goods while customers walk around carrying their wet
umbrellas inside hotels, shops or department stores.As shown in Japanese Patent Application No. JP-A-60-134817,
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 62-125708
and Japanese Patent Application No. JP-A-4-31222, a variety
of storage devices, that can open the storage sacks and
store the umbrellas by just inserting them into the
openings, have been proposed to ease the storage
operation.In the prior methods, as mentioned above, there can
be complex structure problems resulting from the use of
suction as a means to open the storage sacks, from the
number of links, or from the cam mechanism. In
addition, since a vacuum pump or a motor is used, the
production cost increases and such devices cannot be
used where a power source is not available close to the
device. Furthermore, power cords are a hindrance and
there is a danger of a short circuit, in that the
devices are usually operated when it is raining.It is known from JP-A-4-31229 to provide a storage
device for umbrella sacks
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 and
comprising a device body for
storing a plurality of storage sacks.The present invention is characterised by a
vertically movable support arranged in the device body;
a wear plate which is coupled to said support so as to 
lower it when pressed by the end of an umbrella to be
stored; and opening levers pivotally mounted to said
support for insertion into and subsequent opening of said
opening in said foremost sack upon a downward movement of the
movable support, wherein further downward movement of
the support causes said wear plate to rotate downwardly,
thereby allowing said end of an umbrella to enter into
the open storage sack.The storage sacks used in the device, have an open
upper end. The upper front side of the opening is
folded and the upper rear side extends above the front
side. Locking holes are provided at the upper end of
the extended portionIn a preferred embodiment of the present invention,
a number of storage sacks are charged in a storage
device and the openings of said sacks are

<CLAIMS>
A storage device for umbrella sacks comprising a
device body (1) for storing a plurality of storage sacks

(5;104) having an opening in their upper part (5a;104a), and means
(28,128) for opening the opening of the foremost one of said

storage sacks 
characterised by a vertically movable support

(11) arranged in the device body; a wear plate (25)
which is coupled to said support so as to lower it when

pressed by the end (U1) of an umbrella (U) to be stored;
and opening levers (28;128) pivotally mounted to said

support for insertion into and subsequent opening of said
opening (5a;104a) in said foremost sack upon a downward

movement of the movable support (11), wherein further
downward movement of the support causes said wear plate (25)

to rotate downwardly, thereby, in use, allowing said end
of an umbrella to enter into the open storage sack.
A storage device according to claim 1 wherein
the upper part

(51a;141a) of the front side of the opening
of said storage sacks

is folded;
the upper part (52a;141a) of the rear side extends

beyond the front side; and locking holes (5b;104b) are
provided on the upper extended portion.
A storage device for umbrella sacks according to
claim 2 wherein said storage sacks (5;104) are removably

contained in a box (105), the box being removably stored
in the device body (1).
A storage device for umbrella sacks according to
claim 3 wherein said storage sacks (5;104) are suspended

from a hanger (107) in said box (105).
