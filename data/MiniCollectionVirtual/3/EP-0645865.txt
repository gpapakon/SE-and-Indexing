<ABSTRACT>
A surge protector particularly adapted for use with 
telecommunication equipment is non-conductive during normal 

operation and becomes conductive upon surge conditions of a first 
level and provides a short circuit condition when subjected to 

surge condition above a second, greater level. The protector 
comprises a semiconducting chip (16) disposed between first (32, 

32') and second (30, 30') electrodes and is provided with an 
environmental seal (60, 60') shrunk abut the outer peripheral 

surfaces of the electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is that of surge protection
systems and the invention relates more particularly to systems
having solid state surge protection elements.Solid state surge protection systems conventionally employ a
surge protection device having a semiconducting element between a
pair of electrodes. This element is arranged in the circuit to
selectively conduct electrical energy between a portion of a
telephone circuit and ground, for example, in the event the
circuit experiences an electrical surge as a result of lightning
or a short circuit or the like in the circuit, thereby to protect
electrical components connected in the circuit from damage due to
the surge condition. On occasion the circuit will experience an
electrical surge which results in destruction of the
semiconducting element so that the circuit components would not
thereafter be protected against subsequently occurring electrical
surge conditions. Accordingly, conventional surge protection
systems typically incorporate means to move the electrodes into
electrical engagement with each other following destruction of
the semiconductor elements, thereby to maintain a short circuit
condition between the electrodes to protect the circuit
components against subsequently occurring surge conditions until
such time as the semiconducting element is replaced. Frequently,
difficulty is encountered in establishing and maintaining the
desired short circuit condition between the electrodes following
destruction of the semiconducting element. In U.S. Patent No. 5,224,008, issued June 29, 1993 and
assigned to the assignee of the present invention, a surge
protection system comprising a circuit and a device is disclosed
and claimed which provides first and second levels of surge
protection for the circuit and for electrical components in the
circuit. The device comprises a semiconducting element having
first and second electrodes disposed in electrically conductive
relation with respective opposite sides of the element and the
element is normally operable to selectively conduct electrical
energy between the electrodes to provide a first level of surge
protection for the circuit. For example, in one embodiment the
electrodes are connected to a portion of the telephone circuit
and to ground respectively, and the semiconducting element is
non-conductive under normal telephone circuit voltage conditions.
The element becomes conductive on occurrence of selected surge
voltages in the circuit due to lightning or the like for
connecting the circuit to

<CLAIMS>
A surge protection device for protecting a circuit
providing a first level of surge protection for the circuit

and also a second, higher, level of surge protection for
the circuit, the surge protection device comprising a

semiconducting element (16) having two opposite sides, a
first electrode (32) having an outer periphery, said first

electrode being in electrically conductive engagement with
one of the sides (21) of the element, a second electrode

(30) having an outer periphery, said second electrode being
in electrically conductive engagement with the other side

(19) of the element, the element being operable to
selectively conduct electrical energy between the

electrodes to provide said first level of surge protection,
the electrodes further being adapted to move into

electrically conductive relation with each other to
maintain a short circuit condition between the electrodes

in the event of element destruction thereby providing said
second higher level of surge protection, characterised in

that the surge protection device has a sleeve (60) formed
of electrically insulative, heat shrinkable material, the

first and second electrodes being received within the
sleeve and the sleeve being shrunk onto the outer

peripheries of the first and second electrodes (32,30) in
close conformance to the outer peripheries of said

electrodes while being non-adhering to both, to provide
contaminant protection and free slidability of the

electrodes within the sleeve.
A surge protection device according to claim 1 in
which the first and second electrodes (32,30) have

coextensive, outer circular peripheral surfaces having a
diameter less than approximately 0.5 cm, the semiconducting 

element (16) has a rectangular configuration and the sleeve
has a wall thickness in the range of approximately

0.15 - 0.2 cm, whereby the semiconducting element, which
can protrude beyond the outer periphery of the electrodes

by up to approximately 0.075 cm due to tolerances involved
in assembling the surge protecting device, is protected

from mechanical damage due to handling and the like.
A surge protection device according to claim 1 or
claim 2 in which the upper surface of the second electrode

(30) is formed with a recess (48), the side (19) of the
semiconductor element (16) being received in the recess.
A surge protection device according to claim any one
of claims 1, 2 and 3 in which the sleeve (60) is formed of

polyvinyledene fluoride/polyolefin blend.
A surge protection device according to any one of the
preceding claims in which the sleeve (60) is color coded

according to selected electrical characteristics of the
protector.
A surge protection device according to any one of
the preceding claims in which the first electrode (32)

has a bottom surface with a centrally disposed node (44)
depending downwardly therefrom and being adapted to be

placed in electrical engagement with a central portion of
one of the two opposite sides of the semiconducting

element.
