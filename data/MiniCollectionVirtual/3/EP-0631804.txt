<ABSTRACT>
A unit intended to filter and cool the oil of an internal combustion engine, comprising, superposed in the same casing (5), an exchanger with plates (6) with water circulation and a removable cylindrical filter cartridge (12). The exchanger is secured to the crank case (2) of the engine with the aid of a hollow screw (9) which passes right through it and through which passes the oil exit from the unit. An excellent leakproofing between the water and oil is provided inter alia by double ring seals designed with discharge towards the outside of the casing through small holes pierced between the seals in the wall of this casing.

<CLAIMS>
Oil filter / heater exchanger assembly designed to be 
mounted on an engine crankcase (1), comprising on the one hand 

a cylindrical container (5) which can be fixed at its base to 
the crankcase and contains a heat exchanger (6) through which 

both the oil to be cooled and the cooling water can pass, the 
said exchanger being mounted in the container by screwing onto 

the crankcase, directly or otherwise, a central piece (9) 
which is threaded externally and hollow over its entire 

length, and on the other hand an oil filter itself having a 
cylindrical housing and, in this housing, a cylindrical filter 

cartridge (12), the said filter being mounted on the 
exchanger, coaxially with it, so that the spaces external and 

internal to the said cartridge communicate respectively with 
the oil outlet (16) of the exchanger and with the inside of 

the threaded piece, characterised in that the side wall of the 
container (5) is extended beyond the exchanger so as to 

constitute itself the side wall of the housing of the oil 
filter and in that this extension is capped by an easily 

removable cover (15) whose opening allows easy replacement of 
the cartridge (12). 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
heat exchanger (6) is of a stacked plate type. 
Assembly according to either one of Claims 1 and 2, having 
annular sealing joints vis-a-vis the water contained between 

the internal face of the side wall of the container (5) and an 
outer annular surface (18) of the exchanger, characterised in 

that at least one of these joints comprises two axially-close 
O-ring seals (19), the said side wall having in it at least 

one radial hole (21) connecting to the outside the annular gap 
between the two joints.
