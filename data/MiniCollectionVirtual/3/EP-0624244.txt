<CLAIMS>
A rheometer (100) for placing at the outlet of a feed screw of a 
machine for transforming polymer material, the rheometer comprising a 

body (110) having a first end provided with a piece (120) for 
mechanical coupling to said feed screw and having a second end, 

remote from the first, provided with a nozzle (130) for injecting the 
polymer material, said rheometer body (110) having a duct for 

conveying a flow of said polymer material and at least two pressure 
sensors (111, 112, 113) placed along said duct, said duct being 

constituted at least in part by a die (140) presenting a cylindrical 
longitudinal flow hole (144), the rheometer being characterized in 

that the die (140) presents at least two transverse holes (141, 142. 
143) opening out into said flow hole and designed respectively to 

receive said pressure sensors (111, 112, 113) at their outlets into 
the flow hole (144), and in that the rheometer body (110) comprises 

two main parts (116, 117) and an intermediate part (118) assembled 
together in releasable manner and receiving the die, such that the 

intermediate part can be omitted or replaced by an intermediate part 
of different height, the die being replaceable by a corresponding die 

of different height and/or diameter. 
A rheometer according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
rheometer body (110) further includes at least one housing hole (114, 

115) for receiving a temperature sensor. 
A rheometer according to either preceding claim, characterized in 
that the diameter of the flow hole (144) of the die is less than or 

equal to 2.5 mm. 
A rheometer according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
diameter of the flow hole (144) of the die lies in the range 2 mm to 

2.5 mm. 
A rheometer according to claim 2, characterized in that said 
coupling piece (120) includes a housing hole (121) for receiving a 

temperature sensor.  
 
A rheometer according to claim 2 or 5, characterized in that the 
rheometer body (110) includes at least two housing holes (171, 172) 

for receiving temperature sensors and opening out into the duct 
respectively upstream and downstream from the die (140). 
A rheometer according to any preceding claim, characterized in 
that the die (140) presents at least three transverse holes (141, 

142, 143) opening out into the flow hole and receiving pressure 
sensors (111, 112, 113) at their outlets into said flow hole (144). 
A rheometer according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
pressure sensors (111, 112, 113) are connected to a processor unit 

which determines the apparent viscosity and the elasticity of the 
polymer material as a function of the pressure measurements provided 

by said sensors.
