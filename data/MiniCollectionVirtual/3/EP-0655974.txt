<ABSTRACT>
Anti-reflective composites (84) comprising carbon-based polymer substrates (86),such as polyesters, are antireflected by applying to the substrates one or more discontinuous layers of inorganic materials (88, 92) having an index of refraction greater than that of the substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the treatment of
organic polymer surfaces with antireflection coatings.
More specifically, this invention relates to a composite
structure that includes an organic polymer substrate film
having on one or both of its surfaces at least one
coating which reduces light reflection and increases
light transmission. The coatings of this invention are
characterized as causing relatively small amounts of
coloration and haze.One method for reducing light reflection from a
substrate (such as a polymer surface) is to coat the
surface with an antireflective layer having a thickness
of about a quarter wavelength. The antireflective layer
may be a second polymer, or an inorganic material such as
a metal fluoride, metal oxide, or metal nitride, where
the deposited layer has a refractive index less than that
of the substrate. A method for producing such a layer is
disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,066,814. If the
deposited antireflection layer is in contact with the
air, the maximum reduction in reflection is achieved when
the reflective index of the deposited antireflective
layer equals the square root of the refractive index of
the substrate. This approach has two limitations.
First; single layer, low refractive index, antireflection 
coatings have substantial reflected and transmitted
coloration. Secondly, the low refractive index inorganic
materials typically used in these antireflection
coatings, for example magnesium fluoride, silicon
dioxide, or cryolite, are often deposited by evaporative
techniques, not by dc magnetron sputtering, a popular
method for accurately coating polymer substrates.Antireflection coatings having wider bandwidths
(and consequently less coloration) may also be obtained
by using multiple deposited layers. As described in
Optical Thin Films User's Handbook by James D. Rancourt,
Macmillan Publishing Company, 1987, two common
antireflective coating designs are the quarter-quarter
and the quarter-half-quarter stacks. That is to say, the
reflective coating is made up of a number of layers
having differing refractive index materials, each equal
in thickness to one-quarter or one-half of a wavelength
sought to be antireflected. The applicability of these
designs to dc magnetron-sputtering is restricted due to
materials availability and to manufacturing complexity.Another way to decrease the reflection of a
substrate surface is to include a porous coating. As
taught in United States Patent No. 4,252,843, porous
coatings which result in a graded refractive index are
pa
