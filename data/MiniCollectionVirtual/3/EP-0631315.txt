<ABSTRACT>
An assembly structure which can reduce the size and thickness of a 
semiconductor memory package having an LOC structure is provided. It is 

reliable as well as free from short-circuiting between a bonding wire and 
a bus bar due to, for instance, the falling of the bonding wire. A bus 

bar (7) is etched, where necessary, in advance to produce steps (9) and a 
plurality of bus bar regions (8) which are to be traversed by respective 

bonding wires (6), in consideration of the diameter and length of the 
bonding wires used, how they fall, and other factors. One surface of the 

bonding layers of an insulating tape (10) is attached to the back surface 
of the inner leads (4) and the bus bar having the steps, and the 

insulating tape is heated while being pressed at a predetermined 
pressure. As a result, the bonding layer of the insulating tape climbs 

up the side surfaces of the inner leads and the bus bar to form fillets 
(11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit 
and, more specifically, to an assembly structure for a resin-sealing type 
semiconductor package having an LOC (lead-on-chip) structure. With the increase of the size and the integration degree of 
semiconductor memory chips, demands are growing that plastic sealing 
molds for packaging chips be smaller and thinner. A semiconductor 
package having an LOC structure has been proposed in line with this. A 
lead called the "bus bar" is used in an LOC structure type semiconductor 
package to accommodate a number of wires in a limited space. The bus bar 
serves as an inner lead for supplying a voltage (e.g., a power supply 
voltage (Vcc) and a reference voltage (Vss)) to a semiconductor chip, and 
is disposed so as to traverse the chip. Since the bus bar can be 
connected to any point of the chip by short-distance wire bonding to 
supply a voltage, it can be effectively employed to reduce noise and 
increase processing speed. However, since bonding wires for connecting inner leads are 
provided with bonding pads traversing the bus bar, they may fall or may 
be laterally pushed and deformed by a mechanical impact during the 
assembly process, their own weight, or the pressure of an injected resin 
sealing agent. In this manner, the bonding wires may contact the bus 
bar, or may contact each other, thus causing a short-circuit. If bonding wires are wired so as to form a large loop in order to 
avoid their contact with a bus bar, they become longer, thus increasing 
the manufacturing cost. Furthermore, the looping of bonding wires makes 
it more difficult to reduce the size and thickness of semiconductor 
devices. To solve the above problems, various techniques for preventing 
short-circuiting due to the contact of two bonding wires or of a bonding 
wire and a bus bar have been proposed in the past. Figures 4 and 5 show 
an example of those conventional techniques. This is a technique disclosed in Published Unexamined Patent 
Application (PUPA) No. 4-114438. Figure 4 is a perspective view of an  
 
LSI package which is partially cut away to reveal the main part. Figure 
5 is a sectional view taken along its shorter axis. As shown in Figure 
4, a semiconductor chip 2 is sealed in a package main body 1. A pair of 
insulating films 3 is bonded to the principal surface of the 
semiconductor chip 2 so as to extend along its longer sides. The 
insulating films 3 are thin films of, for instance, polyimide type resin, 
and are bonded to the principal
