<ABSTRACT>
The oral hygiene appliance (20) includes a 
base (22) on which upstands a cabinet (34) having top, 

front and rear vertical walls (36,38,40). A pair of 
recesses (42,44) are formed in either side of that 

front wall (38). A plurality of seats (50) within those 
recesses (42,44) are each receptive of a jet tip (56). 

An inlet (60) is defined in the top wall (36). A cover 
(72) is shaped to envelope the cabinet (34) over the 

recesses (42,44) and the inlet (60) with the cover (72) 
being invertable to serve as a reservoir to be positioned 

on top of cabinet (34). Disposed 
within the cabinet (34) is a pump responsive to a 

pressure control for delivering water received from the 
inlet (60). Seated toward one end of the base (22) is 

the lower end of an elongated electric toothbrush body 
(28). Individual brushes (166) are seated in the base 

(22) around the body (28) and those brushes (166) 
ordinarily to the rear of the body (28) are elevated on 

a pedestal (160). At the opposite end of the base (22) 
is a well in which is seated the lower end of a handle 

(26) in which a faceted lower end of one of the jet tips 
(56) may be captivated. A pressure control unit 

cooperates with the pump assembly to guard against 
excessive pressure and permit easy control of the level 

of pressure delivered from the jet tip (56) mounted in 
the handle (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an oral
hygiene appliance. More particularly, it relates to an
oral hygiene center in which are included both an
electric toothbrush together with a plurality of
individual brushes as well as a handle in which is
inserted a selected one of several stored jet tips for
the delivery of pulses of water to the teeth and gums of
the user.Oral hygiene appliances of a kind which
deliver to the teeth and gums of the user jet pulses of
water have come into widespread use since their
introduction into the marketplace well over twenty-five
years ago. An example of one quite successful early unit
is that disclosed and claimed in U.S. reissue patent
RE27274 to Mattingly and assigned to the same assignee
as the present application. RE 27274 discloses the features defined
in the preamble of claim 1. In the appliance of that
patent, a cabinet encloses an electric motor and pump
assembly which feeds the jet pulses through a flexible
hose to the base of a handle into which is fitted a jet
tip. Water inletted to the pump is stored in a reservoir
which in use mounts on top of the cabinet but which for
storage is invertible so as to cover the unit and also
the stored jet tip and its hose. That appliance also
includes in association with its pump a control for
adjusting the level of pressure at which the pulses are
delivered. Many of the principles associated in that
patent still find use today.Over the intervening years numerous
additional patents have issued with respect to oral
hygiene appliances having improvements or worthwhile
additional features over the basic approach and a number
of different manufacturers have entered the field. One
quite successful newer version again introduced by
applicants assignee is that disclosed and claimed in
U.S. patent No. 4,989,590. Indeed, certain features of
that patent continue forward into the appliance to which
the present application is directed. At the same time, the use of the more
ordinary toothbrush has continued to be desirable both
separately and in addition to use of oral irrigators of
the kind discussed above. One version of toothbrush
which has proved to be quite popular is that in which
the brushhead is driven by an electric motor energized
by a battery contained along with the motor in an
elongated handle. Desirably, the unit when stored sits
down into a charging base as to enable recharging of the
battery. One attractive form of electric toothbrush
having all of the basic features necessary is that
disclosed and claimed U.S. patent No.
