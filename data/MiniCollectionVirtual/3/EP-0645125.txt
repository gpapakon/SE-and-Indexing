<ABSTRACT>
A stent for expanding lumens, formed of a wire 
member (8) which has a zigzag configuration comprising a 

series of first and second straight sections (7,17) joined 
by a plurality of bends which are cross-linked with each 

other to form a plurality of turns. The stent need not 
provide means for connecting wire members, and the 

elasticity of the stent is uniform. The position of the 
stent in a body cavity is maintained since any 

longitudinal change of the stent is very small. Also the 
stent provides means for preventing restenosis of the 

lumens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stent and,
more particularly, to a self-expandable stent for
expanding the lumens of a blood vessel or liver in cases
where these are constricted.In many situations, a device is required for
expanding a constricted passageway of a blood vessel or
the liver, or maintaining an open passageway through a
vessel portion. Such situations arise, for example, when
the blood does not flow smoothly or the passageways of the
vessel portion are constricted due to arteriosclerosis or
the growth of a tumor.It is necessary to expand the passageway for
smooth blood flow in such cases, and, for this purpose,
devices are proposed and used for pushing a self-expandable
elastic body into the constricted passageway.
The elastic body is called a stent, which is, for example,
a wire formed in a closed zigzag configuration, joined by
a plurality of bends and wound cylindrically, as disclosed
in EP 0177330.Each section of the stent of the above structure
is formed by a plurality of connecting members which link
sections to each other for practical use. Thus, when the
stent is placed in a bent portion of the lumen, a space is
formed between a bend of a first stent section and a
corresponding bend of a second stent section. This space
allows restenosis of passageways or ducts in the body.To avoid the use of numerous connecting members,
U.S. Patent No. 4,733,665 discloses a graft which is
formed by a tubular shaped member having first and second
ends and a wall disposed between the first and second
ends. The wall surface is formed by a plurality of
intersecting elongate members, at least some of which
intersect with one another intermediate the first and
second ends of the tubular shaped member. In a graft of 
this configuration, since a plurality of elongate members
intersect only with one another, the elasticity of the
graft is formed only in the first and second ends of the
tubular shaped member and it is weak therebetween.EP-A-556850 (see preamble of Claim 1) discloses a stent comprising a helix
of zigzag wire. Adjacent apices of the wire are joined
together by separate joining members in the form of loops.
One loop is provided for each joint, so the apices of the
wire are not directly looped together.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a stent which can form a passageway for blood in
its bent state yet prevent tissue from penetrating it.Another object of the present invention is to
provide a stent which maintains its length in case of
constriction or expansion thereof.A

<CLAIMS>
A self-expandable, cylindrical stent for
expanding a lumen comprising: a single length of wire (8)

bent into a zigzag configuration by forming alternating
peaks and valleys, the zigzag configuration being spirally

wrapped about an axis into a plurality of turns, said axis
forming a longitudinal axis of the stent, and

characterised in that peaks (1) of one turn of the stent
are interlocked with valleys (82) of an adjacent turn of

the stent by directly cross-linking said peaks and
valleys.
A stent according to Claim 1, wherein the wire

has first and second end portions (9,10) each of which is
bent towards and extends towards a central turn of the

stent and is woven in and out of turns of the stent.
A stent according to Claim 2, wherein distal
ends of the first and second end portions are hooked

around a straight portion of a turn.
A stent as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the
length of wire (8) consists of a series of first and

second straight sections joined by a plurality of bends
consisting of lower and upper bends, wherein each of the

first and second straight sections is defined between each
of the upper and lower bends, the first straight section

(7) being longer than the second straight section (17) and
the upper bends (2,12,22..) of one turn being directly

cross-linked with corresponding lower bends (1,11,21..) of
an adjacent turn, and wherein the stent is resiliently

compressible into a smaller diameter first shape in which all of the
straight sections are arranged side by side and closely

adjacent one another for insertion into a passageway with
the bends having a stress therein, the stent being

resiliently radially expandable by release of said stress
into a second shape in which it defines a generally

cylindrical configuration for pressing against a wall of 
the passageway.
A stent according to Claim 4, wherein the wire
has top and bottom end portions (9,10) which extend in a

generally diagonal direction towards the bottom and the
top of the stent, respectively, and which are woven in and

out of turns of the wire from top and bottom ends of the
stent, respectively, towards a center of the stent.
A stent according to Claim 5, wherein distal
ends of the top and bottom end portions (9,10) are fixed

by being wound around a straight section of a turn.
A stent, according to any one of Claims 4 to 6,
in combination with a tubular guide (G) containing the

stent such that the stent is resiliently compressed into
said smaller diameter first shape.
The stent according to any preceding claim,
wherein the stent additionally comprises coating means for

preventing a tumor from penetrating gaps created by the
stent.
The stent according to Claim 8, wherein the
coating means is a nylon mesh (13).
The stent according to Claim 9, wherein the mesh
is additionally coated with silicon rubber (14).
