<ABSTRACT>
A film cassette (1) comprises a cassette shell 
adapted to house a filmstrip, and film exposure-status 

indicating means (35,37,39,41) for providing respective indications 
that a filmstrip housed in the cassette shell is 

unexposed or exposed. According to the invention, the 
film exposure-status indicating means includes a 

plurality of icon cut-outs (35,37,39,41) in the shell uniquely shaped 
to be different from each other for one of the cut-outs 

to denote the filmstrip is unexposed and another of the 
cut-outs to denote the filmstrip is exposed, and an 

indicator flag (43) rotatably supported to be successively 
visible through the cut-outs to highlight the cut-outs to 

provide respective indications that the filmstrip is 
unexposed or exposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to commonly assigned, 
copending applications Serial No. 066,285 entitled FILM 
CASSETTES WITH COMBINED FILM EXPOSURE-STATUS AND FILM 
SPEED INDICATOR DEVICE in the name of Jeffrey R. 
Stoneham, and Serial No. DE 008,735 entitled FILM 
CASSETTE WITH EXPOSURE STATUS INDICATORS and filed 
May 20, 1993 in the name of Dennis R. Zander. The invention relates generally to the field of 
photography, and in particular to film cassettes. More 
specifically, the invention relates to a film cassette 
with a film exposure-status indicator device for 
providing respective indications that a filmstrip housed 
in the cassette shell is unexposed or exposed. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,820, 
issued June 16, 1992, discloses a film cassette 
comprising a cassette shell adapted to house a filmstrip, 
and film exposure-status indicating means for providing 
respective indications that a filmstrip housed in the 
cassette shell is unexposed or partly exposed or fully 
exposed. The film exposure-status indicating means 
includes a colored indicator rib which is rotatable with 
a film spool inside the cassette shell to successively 
move into three identical windows. The respective 
indicator windows are formed in an end cap of the 
cassette shell opposite three visible indicia 
"UNEXPOSED", "PARTIAL", and "EXPOSED" printed on labels 
adhered to the cassette shell. The film spool has three 
spaced detents arranged at separate radial locations for 
engagement to lock the spool in corresponding rotational 
orientations to hold the indicator rib in any one of the 
three windows. The cassette shell has a radial slot in 
which a locking member is movable between a locking 
position for individually engaging anyone of the three  
 
detents and a non-locking position for disengaging anyone 
of the three detents. Prior art U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,820 teaches the 
use of label indicia and corresponding windows to provide 
respective film exposure-status indications. As film 
cassettes are made more compact, the available space for 
separate label indicia and corresponding windows becomes 
scarcer. Thus, it is desirable to consolidate them. According to the invention, a film cassette 
comprising a cassette shell adapted to house a filmstrip, 
and film exposure-status indicating means for providing 
respective indications that a filmstrip housed in the 
cassette shell is unexposed or exposed, is characterized 
in that:
 
   the film exposure-status indicating means 
includes a plurality of icon cut-outs in the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A film cassette comprising a cassette shell 
adapted to house a filmstrip, and film exposure-status 

indicating means for providing respective indications 
that a filmstrip housed in said cassette shell is 

unexposed or exposed, is characterized in that: 
   said film exposure-status indicating means 

includes a plurality of icon cut-outs in said shell 
uniquely shaped to be different from each other for one 

of said cut-outs to denote the filmstrip is unexposed and 
another of the cut-outs to denote the filmstrip is 

exposed, and an indicator flag rotatably supported to be 
successively visible through said cut-outs to highlight 

the cut-outs to provide respective indications that the 
filmstrip is unexposed or exposed. 
A film cassette as recited in claim 1, 
wherein said film exposure-status indicating means 

includes another icon cut-out in said shell which is 
uniquely shaped to denote the filmstrip is processed to 

develop latent images on the filmstrip.
