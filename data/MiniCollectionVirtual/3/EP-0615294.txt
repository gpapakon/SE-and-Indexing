<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric 
device for converting an input mechanical quantity into 
an output electrical quantity, and vice versa. As generally known in the art, piezoelectric 
devices are typically used to convert an input 
mechanical stress into an output electric charge 
(voltage) and also to convert an input electric voltage 
into an output mechanical distortion. In the latter 
case, the output distortion can be used to generate 
mechanical force, displacement or vibration, and the 
device is sometimes called as an electrostrictive device. 
The term "piezoelectric device" as used herein is to be 
interpreted in its broadest sense, as encompassing an 
electrostrictive device as well. Similarly, the term 
"piezoelectric material" as used herein is to be 
interpreted in its broadest sense as encompassing an 
electrostrictive material as well. Conventionally, piezoelectric devices have been 
used for detecting fine mechanical displacement or for 
adjusting lengths and/or positions of the optical path  
 
on a sub-micron order. There have been known unimorph- 
or bimorph-type piezoelectric devices which serve to 
convert an electrical voltage into a bending or flexural 
deformation as actuators for ink jet printing heads, for 
example. In this instance, customers' or end users' 
requirements are oriented to a high-quality and high-speed 
printing performance, and it is desirable to 
realize an improved device with a minimized size and 
operability at a low driving voltage, which provides a 
satisfactory response characteristic and operational 
reliability. Known unimorph- or bimorph-type piezoelectric 
devices typically include a first electrode layer, a 
piezoelectric layer and a second electrode layer which 
are sequentially laminated with each other. With such 
an arrangement of the piezoelectric layer and the 
electrode layers, it is important for the piezoelectric 
layer to have a dimension which is sufficient to cover 
the first electrode layer so as to avoid short-circuit 
between the first and second electrode layers and to 
assure a proper operation of the device. In this 
instance, however, when the piezoelectric layer has an 
edge which protrudes beyond the first electrode layer, 
the edge does not perform a piezoelectric function and 
may restrict the desired movement, relative to the 
substrate, of the remaining region of the piezoelectric  
 
layer which does perform the intended piezoelectric 
function. This is because the edge may be brought into 
a rigidly bonded
