<ABSTRACT>
A positively charged organic photosensitive body 
is provided, the photosensitive body being free from 

public hazards, and being highly sensitive and highly 
durable. The photosensitive body has a photosensitive 

layer (2) of a laminated structure on a conductive 
substrate (1). Th
e photosensitive layer (2) has a 
charge transport layer (I) (2a) having hole mobility, 

a charge generation layer (2b), and a charge transport 
layer (II) (2c) containing a curing product of a doped 

amino resin and having electron mobility. The charge 
transport layer (I) (2a), the charge generation layer 

(2b), and the charge transport layer (II) (2c) are 
laminated in this order on the conductive substrate 

(1). Various suitable substances may be added to the 
charge transport layer (II) (2c), thereby enhancing 

its durability without deteriorating the 
photosensitive characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive 
body for electrophotography and more specifically to 
an organic photosensitive body for electrophotography 
which includes a photosensitive layer having a novel 
structure and which is used in a positively charged 
state. A photosensitive body for electrophotography 
(hereinafter may be referred to simply as 
photosensitive bodys) for use in electrophotographic 
apparatus that was begun with the invention of 
Carlson, there have been widely employed 
photosensitive bodys comprising inorganic 
photoconductive materials such as selenium, selenium 
alloys, zinc oxide, and cadmium sulfide. Recently, 
however, photosensitive bodys comprising organic 
photoconductive materials have been developed 
energetically because of their nontoxic nature, film-forming 
properties, light weights, low prices, and so 
on. Among them are so-called double-layered laminate 
type organic photosensitive bodys having a 
photosensitive layer divided into a charge generation 
layer for receiving light to generate charge carriers 
therein, and a charge transport layer for transporting 
the charge carriers which are generated in the charge 
generation layer. The photosensitive bodys of this  
 
type have many advantages such that their sensitivity 
can be enhanced markedly by combining the respective 
layers formed of materials optimal for their 
functions, and that their spectral sensitivity can be 
increased in response to the wavelength of exposing 
light. Thus, they have become the mainstream of 
development, and their practical use is under way. Many of the double-layered laminate type organic 
photosensitive bodys that have now found practical use 
comprise a charge generation layer and a charge 
transport layer in this order arranged on a conductive 
substrate. This layered structure is preferred, 
because it is advantageous in that the charge 
generation layer in the form of a thin film with a 
thickness of 1 µm or less can be protected with the 
charge transport layer with a film thickness of 
several tens of micrometers. At the time of image 
formation, the photosensitive body is usually charged 
negative on its surface. This is because the charge 
transfer substance of the charge transport layer now 
in practical use has hole mobility. For the purpose of image formation, the surface of 
the photosensitive body is charged normally by a 
corona discharge. A corona discharger such as a 
corotron discharger or a scorotron discharger gives 
off ozone. Compared with a
