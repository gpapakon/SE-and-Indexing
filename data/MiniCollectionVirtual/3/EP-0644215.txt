<ABSTRACT>
Bis(N-alkylaminocyclohexyl)methanes are excellent curing agents or chain extenders 
in the formation of polyurethane and polyurea polymers, both elastomers and coatings, from 

both monomeric polyisocyanates and isocyanate-terminated prepolymers. These chain 
extenders may be used alone or in combination with other polyamines and with polyols. A 

broad spectrum of unique polymeric material can be formed with a range of diverse 
properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
As a subclass of commercially available polymers, polyurethane elastomers
have several properties whose advantages confer unique benefits on them. Typically,
polyurethanes and the related polyureas show high abrasion resistance with high load
bearing, excellent cut and tear resistance, high hardness, and resistance to ozone
degradation, yet are portable and castable. Compared to metals, polyurethanes are
lighter in weight, less noisy in use, show better wear and excellent corrosion
resistance while being capable of less expensive fabrication. Compared to other
plastics, polyurethanes are non-brittle, much more resistant to abrasion, and exhibit
good elastomeric memory. Polyurethanes find use in such diverse products as aircraft
hitches, bushings, cans, gaskets, star wheels, washers, scraper blades, impellers, gears,
and also serve as coatings in a wide variety of uses.Part of the utility of polyurethanes (and polyureas) derives from their
enormous diversity of properties resulting from a relatively limited number of
reactants. Typically, polyurethanes are prepared on site by reacting (curing) the
terminal isocyanate groups of a monomeric polyisocyanate or of a low molecular
weight prepolymer with the isocyanate-reactive hydrogens of a polyfunctional
compound so as to form high polymers through chain extension and, in some cases,
crosslinking. Urethane prepolymers are adducts of polyisocyanates and polyhydric
alcohols as exemplified by the 2:1 adducts of a diisocyanate and a diol, and urea
prepolymers are adducts of monomeric polyisocyanates and polyamines. Diols, and
especially alkylene diols, are the most common isocyanate-reactive materials used as
curing agents and lead to linear polymers by chain extension. Where a triol or a
higher polyhydric alcohol is used crosslinking occurs to afford a non-linear
polymer.
Although other polyfunctional materials, especially diamines, are theoretically 
suitable, with but a few exceptions none have achieved commercial importance as a
curing agent. The major exceptions are 4,4'-methylene-di-ortho-chloroaniline
usually referred to as MOCA, and the 2,4- and 2,6-diamino-3,5-diethyl-1-methylbenzene,
often referred to as diethyltoluene diamine or DETDA, curing agents
which are both a chain extender and a crosslinker. More recently selected secondary
diamines and polyamines have found favor as curing agents. The secondary diamines
act solely as chain extenders.Among the unsatisfied needs in the polyurethane and polyurea elastomer field
is that for a product which shows
