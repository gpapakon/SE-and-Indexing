<ABSTRACT>
An intramuscular lead (100) for the electrical 
stimulation of muscle tissue. The improved lead has a 

needle (118) connected to a strand of suture (120), a 
coiled conductor (108) coupled to the strand by a 

reduced diameter portion of the coiled conductor, an 
insulative cover (101) over part of the coiled 

conductor; and terminal connector means (102) coupled to 
the coiled conductor to provide a connection to a pulse 

generator. Through such a construction the lead may be 
more readily introduced through muscle tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to skeletal
muscle stimulation, and more particularly, it relates to
an intramuscular lead system having an improved
electrode end for easier insertion.Skeletal muscle tissue is often used to provide
cardiac assistance. Such systems which utilize skeletal
muscle tissue may be seen in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,411,268,
4,813,952, and 4,735,205.Such systems use a patient's own muscle tissue in
conjunction with an implantable pulse generator to
provide cardiac assistance. In comparison to presently
available cardiac assist systems using wholly artificial
structures, systems using a patient's skeletal muscle
are extremely compact and energy efficient. Such
cardiac assist systems, however, are not without
limitations. One problem presented by the use of
skeletal muscle power for cardiac assistance is the
application of electrical stimulation signals to cause
skeletal muscle contraction.The electrical connection between an implantable
pulse generator and the desired skeletal muscle is
accomplished through a lead. Generally speaking a lead
is a wire insulated along its length and having an
electrode at one end and connectable to a pulse
generator at its other end. Through a lead the
electrical signal may be communicated to and from
skeletal muscle tissue.The earliest skeletal muscle powered cardiac
assist systems used screw-in type leads for skeletal
muscle stimulation. A major improvement to these leads
is found in the use of steroid eluting pacing leads.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,251 teaches the use of an
endocardial pacing lead having steroid drug embedded in
the distal tip. This embedded steroid drug treats the
heart tissue immediately in contact with the pacing 
electrode. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,506,680; 4,577,642; and
4,606,118 teach similar endocardial leads, all of which
treat the electrode contact area with a steroid. United
States Statutory Invention Registration No. H356
discloses an endocardial pacing lead suitable for
epicardial insertion which elutes a steroid drug from
the electrode.A further improvement in intramuscular lead
technology arose with the adaptation of heart wire
technology for chronic pacing use. Typically such leads
are constructed as follows: A connector assembly has a
coiled connector attached thereto. The coiled connector
is insulated along a part of its length while a suture
runs throughout its inner lumen, from the connector
assembly to an end. At the end of the suture a helical
portion is formed, and a needle is attached to the end
of the suture. The
