<ABSTRACT>
A catalytic system for the acylation of cellulose comprises the addition product of sulphuric acid and N,N-dimethyl 
acetamide as well as free sulphuric acid or free N,N-dimethyl acetamide in the following rations by weight (in moles): addition 

product of sulphuric acid with N,N-dimethyl acetamide 1.0; free sulphuric acid, not more than 0.49; or free N,N-dimethyl 
acetamide not more than 0.40. The process for obtaining such a catalytic system involves allowing sulphuric acid to react with 

N,N-dimethyl acetamide in the absence of water at a temperature of 0 to 25 
o
C and in the following proportions by weight (in 
moles): sulphuric acid 1.0; N,N-dimethyl acetamide not more than 1.4. A method of
 acylating cellulose in the presence of the 
proposed catalytic system involves treating the cellulose with acetic acid, following which the activated cellulose thus obtained 

is treated with an aliphatic acid anhydride at a temperature of 10 to 90 
o
C in the presence of the proposed catalytic system 
whose proportion by weight is 1.5 to 30 % that of the weight of cellulose calculated in respect of sulphuric acid, the weight ratio 

of the liquid phase to cellulose being accordingly 3 to 7:1. The process for obtaining acetone-soluble primary acetates of 
cellulose using the proposed catalytic system and acylation method disclosed involves activating the cellulose with acetic acid, 

acetylating the activated cellulose using acetic anhydride in the presence of the proposed catalytic system which contains 0.2 
to 0.4 moles of free N,N-dimethyl acetamide to 1.0 mole of the addition product of sulphuric acid and N,N-dimethyl acetamide, 

and is applied in an amount equal to 20 to 30% by weight of the weight of the cellulose calculated in respect of sulphuric acid. 
The weight ratio of the liquid phase to cellulose is 4 to 7:1 and treatment of the cellulose acetate thus formed with aqueous 

acetic acid takes place in two stages: in the first stage, treatment is carried out at a temperature of 70 to 85 
o
C for one to two 
hours with aqueous acetic acid containing 4.0 to 5.0 % by weight water and a neutralizing agent in an amount such that the 

free sulphuric acid content in the system will be equal to 5.0 to 10.5 % by weight of the cellulose; in the second stage, treatment 
is carried out with aqueous acetic acid containing 14.0 to 15.0 % water at a temperature of 65 to 70 
o
C for 1 to 2 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalytic system
for cellulose acylation and to processes for producing
said catalytic system and its application for cellulose
acylation and synthesis of acetone-soluble primary cellulose
acetates.The aforesaid catalytic system incorporates as the
base an adduct of sulfuric acid and an aliphatic acid
N,N-dialkylamide (DAA). No direct reference to the presence
or formation of said adduct in the reaction medium
for producing cellulose esters. At the same time a number
patents describe nonindustrial processes for synthesis of
cellulose esters, wherein said adduct, in our opinion, may
be formed and may function as a specific catalyst. Such
processes are recommended for carrying into effect an accelerated
process of cellulose acetylation at high temperatures,
with maintaining high degree of polymerization of
the product obtained.Cellulose esters produced with the use of said catalytic
system are used in traditional fields, e.g., for producing
artificial fibers, cigarette stick, cine and photographic
materials, commercial and household-use plastics,
lacquers and varnishes, surface-coating materials, and for
other applications.US Patent A, 2,705,710 discloses a cellulose acetylation
process which, in our opinion, (since no direct reference
is given in said Patent) incorporates formation of
an adduct of sulfuric acid with N,N-dialkylamide (DAA) selected
from the group consisting of N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMFA), N,N-diethylformamide (DEFA), N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMAA), and N,N-diethylacetamide (DEAA), said adduct being 
dissolved in a great amount of the respective amide. The
inventors have to use a large proportion of amide (450 moles
per mole of sulfuric acid) which, in our opinion,
enables one to suppress an excess high-temperature dissociation
of the adduct into free sulfuric acid and amide,
thereby retaining an increased degree of polymerization
of the cellulose triacetate being synthesized. This, however,
results in too a high acetylation module and therefore
complicates the process of regeneration of a mixture
of a large number of solvents (acetic acid and N,N-dialkylamide).Known in the present state of the art is a process
for producing primary acetone-soluble cellulose acetates,
using titanium compound as the catalyst (US, A, 2,976,277),
wherein a "homogeneous" acetylation mechanism takes place.
A disadvantage inherent in said process resides in that
acetylation is conducted in the medium of acetic anhydride
with a high module of acetylation equal to 13, the amount
of
