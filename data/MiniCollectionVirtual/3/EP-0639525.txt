<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to develop further a method of this type, so that the preparation efficiency is increased. This object is achieved, according to the invention, in that, in the event of a negative pressure prevailing at the suction nozzle, the unwinding bobbin is rotated in the direction of turns of the winding, before the unwinding bobbin is driven opposite to the direction of turns. In the case of an arrangement of a plurality of preparation devices within a transport circuit of a winding machine, this measure can extend only to a preparation device located furthest downstream. For a further improvement in the loosening of opposed laps, mechanical thread-loosening means can additionally be used.
