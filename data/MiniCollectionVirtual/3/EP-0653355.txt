<ABSTRACT>
A container for small objects, with mutual coupling 
means, comprising a first (2) and a second (3) half-shells 

which can be mutually coupled to form a container (1) for 
removably accommodating small objects. Furthermore, on at 

least one of the half-shells (2,3), engagement means 
(10,11) are provided for coupling with engagement means 

(10,11) formed on the half-shell of an adjacent container 
(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container for small
objects, with mutual coupling means.It is known that containers for small objects,
generally but not necessarily games and the like, are placed
inside many products.These containers are usually constituted by two half-shells
which mutually couple and substantially have a
cylindrical shape with a rounded bottom.Said container, normally made of plastics, has a very
limited usefulness, since it merely contains the small
objects when the container is placed inside the product to
be sold but cannot be subsequently reused, as it cannot
assume a specific function of its own; accordingly, said
container is usually thrown away.It is known from FR-A-2 595 667 a container as defined
in the preamble of claim 1.A principal aim of the invention is indeed to solve the
above described problem, providing a container for small
objects that can have a specific function of its own, so
that in addition to containing small objects, as occurs with
conventional containers, it can be used as an element for a
snap-together game or the like.Within the scope of this aim, a particular object of
the invention is to provide a container which despite having
an additional function can be used and handled with the
devices that are currently in use.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
container that can be used as an integral element of more 
complicated structures obtained by applying further
completion elements to the outer surface of the container.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
container that can be used as an integral element of more
complicated structures obtained by applying further
completion elements to the outer surface of the container.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
container that can be easily obtained starting from commonly
commercially available elements and materials and is
furthermore competitive from a merely economical point of
view.This aim, these objects, and others which will become
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a container as defined
in appended claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages will become
apparent from the following detailed description of a
container for small objects, illustrated only by way of non-limitative
example in the accompanying drawings, wherein:
figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of the
container according to the invention;figure 2 is a perspective view of the container with
the two half-shells in open position;figure 3 is a front elevation view of the

<CLAIMS>
A container for small objects, with mutual coupling
elements, comprising a first (2) and a second (3) half-shell

which can be mutually coupled to form a container (1) for
removably accommodating small objects, the container further

comprising, on at least one of said half-shells (2, 3)
engagement means (10, 11) for coupling engagement means (10,

11) formed on the half-shell of an adjacent container,
characterized in that a protruding lip (4) is formed on

one of the first and second half-shells and a corresponding
groove (5) is formed on the other of the first and second

half-shells (2, 3), said first and second half-shells
being coupled in a snap-together manner by means of the coupling

of said lip (4) in said groove (5).
A container according to claim 1, characterized in
that said engagement means comprise male (10) and female

(11) engagement means that alternate on the same half-shell
(2, 3).
A container according to claim 1, characterized in
that said first and second half-shells (2, 3) have a

polygonal cross-section.
A container according to claim 3, characterized in

that said first and second half-shells (2, 3) have a
hexagonal cross-section.
A container according to claim 2, characterized in
that said engagement means have a male dovetail engagement

protrusion (10) adapted to be detachably coupled in a
corresponding female dovetail engagement seat (11) formed on

the adjacent face of the respective half-shell (2, 3).
