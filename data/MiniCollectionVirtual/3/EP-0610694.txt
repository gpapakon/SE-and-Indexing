<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of drilling, desmearing, and additively 
circuitizing a printed circuit board. The printed circuit 

board is drilled under conditions which produce glass and 
polymer smeared vias and through holes. The particulate 

debris is removed by vapor blasting the drilled printed 
circuit board. Next the printed circuit board is soaked in a 

solvent to swell the drill smear on the circuit interplanes of 
the printed circuit board. This solvent is then removed by 

entrainment in a gas, and a stream of an aqueous, acidic, 
oxidizing solution is passed through the printed circuit board 

holes to remove swollen smear in the thru holes and produce an 
etchback of conductors. After a water rinse an aqueous 

reducing solution is passed through the printed circuit board 
to reduce and remove aqueous acidic oxidizing solution, e.g., 

residual aqueous acid oxidizing solution. The printed circuit 

board is rinsed to remove the aqueous reducing solution. The 
surface of the printed circuit board is then seeded, the 

intended circuitization is photolithographically defined on 
the printed circuit board, and the circuitization, including 

the surface circuitization and the plated through hole 
circuitization, is additively plated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the fabrication of microelectronic 
circuit packages. The circuit packages have X-Y plane (surface 
and internal) circuitization and Z-axis (vias and through 
holes) circuitization. Generally, the metallization is multi-layer, 
with a palladium seed layer deposited on the dielectric 
surface, and a copper circuitization layer deposited atop the 
palladium seed layer. The vias and through holes are prepared by drilling through 
the substrate, desmearing the drilled holes, and plating the 
via and through hole walls to impart electrical conductivity 
thereto. One problem encountered in drilling, desmearing, and 
plating the vias and through holes is the incompatibility of 
the swelling reagents with the oxidizing materials used in 
subsequent processing steps. It has heretofore been necessary 
to utilize halocarbons, such as methyl chloroform, to remove 
the swelling agents. Specifically, the swelling agents react with the CrO₃ used in a 
subsequent step, requiring an increased rate of oxidizing 
agent make-up. In additive circuitization, a Pd "seed" layer is applied onto 
the surface of the substrate, and photoresist is applied atop 
the "seed" palladium, imaged, and developed to expose areas 
where circuitization is to be applied. The circuitization, 
i.e., copper circuitization, is deposited atop the seed layer, 
between walls of photoresist. According to the invention the drill smear is removed by a 
carefully monitored process that eliminates the need for ozone  
 
depleting solvents, such as methyl chloroform, and instead 
utilizes a vapor blast of the drilled printed circuit board to 
remove the particulate residue, followed by a soaking in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 
or another suitable solvent, such as N,N-dimethyl formamide, 
or dimethyl sulfoxide to "swell" the smear on the circuit 
interplanes of the board, increasing its susceptibility to 
attack by the oxidizing medium. This swelling solvent is 
removed from the printed circuit board by mechanical means, 
for example by a relatively long air blow, where the air 
stream is scrubbed to remove and recover the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 
or other solvent. Following the removal of the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 
an aqueous acidic oxidizing solution is 
fed, e.g., gravity fed, through the printed circuit board. 
One preferred aqueous acidic oxidizing solution is aqueous 
H₂SO₄-CrO₃. The oxidizing agent is fed through the printed 
circuit board holes to remove smear in the thru holes and 
produce an etchback of the exposed
