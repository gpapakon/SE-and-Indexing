<ABSTRACT>
The production of slit-type slide fasteners in injection moulds is accelerated by the movement of the slit former (17) being synchronised with the movement of the ejector (13, 45, 46, 49). Part of the slit former slides during ejecting of the product and during closing of the mould in a guide (28) which effects a movement of the slit-forming part (15) of the slit former (17) obliquely to the general ejecting direction, as a result of which this slit-forming part (15) of the slit former (17) is inevitably drawn out from the heads of the slide fastener teeth (32). The production of the slide fastener is preferably performed in a mould in which the split (5), which has inter alia the forms for the end elements (20, 21; 25; 26) is fitted decentrally at one end of the mould. The hot runner (35) in this mould is designed such that the material flow is initially conducted to the feed nozzle (41) furthest away from the split (5) and from there is conducted to the nozzle (43) which is closest to the split (5) and is in operation no matter the length of the slide fastener. In this way it is ensured that, even in the case of short slide fastener lengths, the material is permanently exchanged over the unrequired nozzles (41, 42) and ageing or decomposing processes of stationary material in the hot runner (35) are avoided.

Method for injection moulding a zip fastener having 
at least one tape comprising teeth (32) which are 

attached to a carrier tape (31), the teeth (32) being 
provided with bases which connect them to the carrier 

tape (31), and the heads of the teeth (32) being 
provided with a slit, in an injection mould (1, 30) in 

which the teeth (32) are moulded to said tape (31) laid 
down in said injection mould and which contains at least 

one slit former (17) for producing said slit in the 
teeth heads, characterized in that the slit former (17) 

is moved in the ejecting direction when the tape (31) is 
ejected from the mould after the injection, the slit 

former (17) being pulled out of the tooth head slits by 
the double action of a guide (28) which is disposed 

obliquely to said ejecting direction. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the slit former movement is effected synchronously with 

the ejecting movement. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that ejectors (45, 46) are provided which during the 

ejection press on sprue parts (11) of the teeth (32) and 
on slit formers (17) directly or via intermediate 

elements and which forcibly withdraw at least the slit 
formers (17) when returning to the injecting position. 
Device for carrying out the method according to one 
of claims 1 to 3 with an injection mould which comprises 

at least one row of moulds (9) for the teeth of a zip 
fastener and at least one slit former (17) for shaping 

slits in the heads of the teeth (32), and whose mould 
partition plane extends about centrally through the  

 
tooth moulds (9), characterised in that the slit former 

comprises, in addition to its slit shaping portion (15) 
which serves for the formation of slits in the tooth 

heads, a guide portion (16) which is slidingly guided 
within a double acting guide (28) which is arranged 

within the injection mould (1) obliquely to the ejecting 
direction and whose shape is complementary to the guide 

portion (16) of the slit former. 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the guide portion (16) of the slit former (17) is a 

strip, an interrupted strip or a row formed of at least 
two pins. 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 5, 
characterised in that the slit former (17) is 

essentially an angled strip having an inversed L-shaped 
cross-section, said L forming an angle different from 

90째, the base of the L representing the slit former tool 
(15), and the leg of the L being essentially the guide 

portion (16). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the base (15) and the stem (16) of the L enclose an 

angle in the range of from 50째 to 85째, preferably of 
about 75째. 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 7, 
characterised in that the guide portion extends into the 

slot-shaped guide (28) arranged in the injection mould, 
the slot (28) being adapted to the thickness of the 

guide portion (16), and the surfaces of the slot (28) 
and of the guide portion (16) being selected such as to 

allow an essentially play-free but smooth sliding of the 
guide portion (16) within the guide (28).  

 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 8, comprising 
an injection mould with a slider (5) which includes at 

least two sets of moulds, namely for top and bottom stop 
elements and for zip fastener tapes, respectively,
 
the slider (5) being movable transversely to the row of 

moulds (9) for the zipper teeth and comprising at least 
one mould (26) for at least one zipper tape which 

essentially consists of moulds for zipper teeth,
 
the injection material being capable of being supplied 

by at least one nozzle (43) from a hot runner to a gate 
runner (11) extending along the tooth moulds (9), from 

which it can pass into the tooth moulds (9) and into the 
moulds (26; 20, 21; 25) within the slider (5),
 
the slider (5) being disposed at one end of the tape 

moulds (3),
