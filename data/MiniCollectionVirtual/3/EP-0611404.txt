<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are flexible, kink-resistant shaped fabric products which are particularly well adapted for protecting and/or covering elongate substrates, such as cables, conduits, wiring and the like. The shaped fabric products include a wall portion comprising a filament resiliently set in a spiral configuration with respect to the longitudinal axis of the shaped product. The wall portion may also preferably comprise a filament in the form of circumferential hoops substantially conforming in shape and size to the cross-sectional configuration of the shaped product. Also disclosed are methods for forming such shaped product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to tubular 
products, and more particularly to tubular fabrics which are 
particularly well adapted for bundling and protecting 
elongated articles, such as wires, cables, hoses and conduits. The use of fabric sleeves for encasing cables, hoses 
and other elongated flexible articles is well-known in the 
art. Examples of such sleeving are available from the 
Bentley-Harris Manufacturing Company under the registered 
trademark EXPANDO. The EXPANDO® sleeving is lightweight and 
provides tough physical protection for cable assemblies, wire 
harnesses and the like. The open construction of this type of 
product is of advantage over solid material in that it 
breathes and prevents the entrapment of moisture. In 
addition, this type of sleeving maintains the bundled, 
elongated articles in clean, compact condition. While sleeving of the type employed by the EXPANDO® 
product has achieved significant success and possesses certain 
advantageous characteristics, a need for flexible, kink-resistant 
woven tubular products continues to exist. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,228,824 - Evans et al., for example, recognizes 
the difficultly of providing woven tubular products which 
resist kinking when curved or bent. Evans et al. teaches that 
this difficulty may be overcome by providing a hose having a 
reinforcement structure comprised of plied warp yarns formed 
of filaments of high modulus material which resists 
longitudinal extension of the hose. The warp elements of 
Evans et al. are said to have a high degree of twist in the  
 
filaments in order to provide stability to the hose wall when 
compressed during curving of the hose. Furthermore, Evans et al 
illustrates the warp elements as extending along the length of 
the hose in a direction substantially parallel to the axis of the 
hose. US Patent No 4,652,263 - Herwick et al is directed to woven 
fabric tubes especially adapted for use as prostheses in 
biomedical applications. Herwick et al note that such woven 
fabric tubes are preferably capable of returning their original 
shape after being stretched, compressed or bent. Herwick et al 
also note that such tubular products should also be resistant to 
kinking or radial collapse. Elasticity is imparted to the tubes 
of Herwick et al by providing the woven tubular products with 
axially-orientated warp threads forming loops extending radially 
outward between circumferential fill threads. The loops are set 
to return to the loop configuration upon release of tension 
applied axially

<CLAIMS>
A flexible abrasion and kink-resistant fabric sleeve (10) 
for the bundling and protection of elongated articles, such 

as wires, cables, hoses, and conduits, said sleeve being 
comprised of warp (14) and fill (13) ends, the wall portion of said sleeve having an open 

construction, said sleeve having a substantially circular 
cross-sectional configuration and characterised by an ARP 

abrasion resistance of at least about 25,000 cycles, and by 
comprising at least one resilient filamentary fill end (13) 

having a resilient set in a hoop configuration disposed in 
a plane extending substantially perpendicularly to the 

sleeve central axis (Z); and
 
at least one resilient filamentary warp end (14) interwoven 

with said fill end, said warp end having a resilient set in 
a spiral configuration and having a pitch of from about 0.2 

to about 0.3 turns per 25.4mm (1 inch) of sleeve length. 
The sleeve of claim 1 characterised in that said 
filamentary fill end and said filamentary warp end each 

comprise a synthetic monofilament. 
The sleeve of claim 1 characterised in that said sleeve is 
discontinuous in the circumferential direction thereby 

forming adjacent longitudinal edges that define a 
slit (15). 
The sleeve of claim 1 characterised in that said fill ends 
and said warp ends each comprise filament formed of 

thermoplastic resin. 
The sleeve of claim 1 characterised in that said 
filamentary fill end and said filamentary warp end each 

comprise a monofilament of thermoplastic resin selected 
from the group consisting of polyamides, polyesters and 

combinations of these.  
 
The sleeve of claim 1 characterised in that said sleeve 
consists essentially of one or more of said filamentary 

fill ends and one or more of said filamentary warp ends. 
The sleeve of claim 1 characterised in that said sleeve has 
a substantially circular cross-section with an inner 

diameter of from about 6.4mm (0.25 inch) to about 102mm 
(4 inches). 
A sleeve according to claim 3 characterised in that said 
adjacent longitudinal edges (15) are in an overlapping 

relationship.
