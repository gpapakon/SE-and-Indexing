Compositions and methods are disclosed for sanitizing aqueous media, which combine a chlorine-source composition and a glycoluril-source composition. The compositions are added together or separately, continuously or periodically, and by any of a variety of methods. The glycoluril compound stabilizes the chlorine and prolongs its useful life as a microbicidal agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
disinfectant systems for swimming pool and spa water, cooling
tower water, and other aqueous media. More particularly, the
invention relates to systems utilizing chlorine as a
disinfectant, and to compositions and methods for stabilizing
and increasing the useful life of the chlorine in such
systems.The steady increase in the number of swimming pools in
use each year has given rise to the need for a more
effective, safe, and convenient chemical sanitation.
Chlorine in various forms is the most widely used chemical
for this purpose, since it is both economical and also highly
effective in bacteria and algae control. However, its
efficiency and effectiveness vary, and depend upon the method
used to introduce the element into the pool water and the
type of chlorine compound used. Gaseous chlorine,
hypochlorites, and chlorinated organics are all used for
swimming pool sanitation and exhibit different types of
chlorine residuals and various degrees of bactericidal
activity, algicidal activity, and chemical consumption. In
addition, such external variables as pool usage and climatic
conditions have significant effects upon the efficiency of
the sanitizing action.Various approaches have been proposed in the prior art
for stabilizing the chlorine in disinfecting systems. For 
example, in U.S. Patent No. 2,988,471, issued to Robert J.
Fuchs et al. on June 13, 1961, there is described a method
for stabilizing chlorine in aqueous solutions against
decomposition by exposure to ultraviolet light or by contact
with iron and copper. The method involves adding to the
aqueous solution cyanuric acid, ammelide or a salt thereof.
The loss of active chlorine is reported to be substantially
reduced when the weight concentration of the cyanuric acid is
greater than the weight concentration of the available
chlorine. The use of cyanuric acid to substantially reduce
the loss of active chlorine in aqueous systems exposed to
sunlight, for example in swimming pools, has received wide
commercial acceptance. See also, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
4,187,293, issued to Nelson on February 5, 1980.Although satisfactory results are achieved with the use
of cyanuric acid, serious problems exist. One problem is the
relatively short half life of active chlorine when exposed to
sunlight. At 50 ppm cyanuric acid, the chlorine half-life is
only seven hours. On a normal sunny day the majority of the
chlorine sanitizer is depleted rapidly.A second problem that exists is the build up of cyanuric
acid in the
