<ABSTRACT>
A set of contiguous and partially overlapping cDNA sequences and polypeptides encoded thereby, designated as LS170 and transcribed from lung tissue, is described. These sequences are useful for the detecting, diagnosing, staging, monitoring, prognosticating, in vivo imaging, preventing or treating, or determining the predisposition of an individual to diseases and conditions of the lung, such as lung cancer. Also provided are antibodies which specifically bind to a LS170-encoded polypeptide or protein, and agonists or inhibitors which prevent action of tissue-specific LS170 polypeptides, which molecules are useful for the therapeutic treatment of lung diseases, tumors, or metastases.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REAGENTS AND METHODS USEFUL FOR DETECTING DISEASES OF THE LUNGBackground of the Invention The invention relates generally to detecting diseases of the lung.Furthermore, the invention also relates to reagents and methods for detecting diseases of the lung. More particularly, the present invention relates to reagents such as polynucleotide sequences and the polypeptide sequences encoded thereby, as well as methods which utilize these sequences. The polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences are useful for detecting, diagnosing, staging, monitoring, prognosticating, in vivo imaging, preventing or treating, or determining predisposition to diseases or conditions of the lung, such as lung cancer.Lung cancer is the second most common cancer for both men and women in the United States, with an estimated 171,500 newly diagnosed during 1998 (American Cancer Society statistics). It also is the most common cause of cancer death for both sexes, with over 160,000 lung cancer related deaths expected in 1998. Lung cancer is a major health problem in other areas of the world, with approximately 135,000 new cases occurring each year in the European Union, and its incidence rapidly increasing in Central and Eastern Europe. See. Genesis Report. February 1995 and T. Reynolds, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 87: 1348-1349 (1995).Early stage lung cancer can be detected by chest radiograph and the sputum cytological examination; however, these procedures do not have sufficient sensitivity for routine use as screening tests for asymptomatic individuals. Potential technical problems which can limit the sensitivity of chest radiograph include suboptimal technique, insufficient exposure, and positioning and cooperation of the patient. T.G. Tape et al., Ann. Intern. Med. 104: 663-670 (1986). Moreover, radiologists often disagree on interpretations of chest radiographs; over 40% of these disagreements are significant or potentially significant, with false-negative interpretations being the cause of most errors. P.G. Herman et al., Chest 68: 278-282 (1975). Inconclusive results require 

additional follow-up testing for clarification. T.G. Tape et al., supra. Sputum cytology is even less sensitive than chest radiography in detecting early lung cancer; of 160 lung cancer cases, radiography alone detected 123 cases (77%) while cytological examination alone detected 67 cases (42%).
