<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for the elimination of false negative test results in assays for the detection of amplified analyte nucleic acid in a sample. Prior to amplification, an internal control is added to the sample, comprising a nucleic acid distinguishable from the analyte nucleic acid, that can be amplified with the same amplification reagents as the analyte nucleic acid. Preferably the internal control comprises a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to the analyte nucleic acid that has been mutated to discriminate it from the analyte nucleic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
elimination of false negative test results in assays for
the detection of amplified analyte nucleic acid.Normally, when amplified nucleic acid is to be detected in
a sample, negative test results, that is results
indicating that no analyte nucleic acid was originally
present in the sample under investigation, can only be
confirmed by carrying out a separate confirmation assay.
Since the performance of separate confirmation tests is a
rather time consuming event the need exists for a method
for providing a control on negative test results in assays
for the detection of amplified analyte nucleic acid. When
each sample can be provided with a direct internal check
on the assaying procedures and the amplification method no
separate confirmation tests have to be performed.The addition of other sequences to a sample comprising
analyte nucleic acid, which are capable of being
coamplified with the analyte nucleic acid, has been
described by Becker and Hahlbrock (Nucleic Acids Research,
Vol. 17. Number 22, 1989). The method described by Becker
and Hahlbrock is a method for the quantification of
nucleic acid where different known amounts of internal
standard, comprising a nucleic acid sequence that differs
from the analyte nucleic acid by just one nucleotide
(point mutation) are added to a sample containing an
unknown amount of analyte nucleic acid and coamplified by
PCR with the analyte nucleic acid. By introducing one base
change in the internal standard sequence a specific
restriction site is created and the mutant sequence is cut
with the appropriate restriction enzyme before the sample
containing the amplified nucleic acid is applied to an
electrophoretic gel. The nucleic acid is quantified by
comparing the bands in the gel representing (a part of)
the mutant sequence and the analyte nucleic acid. Becker and Hahlbrook use the internal standard as a marker
in their quantification method where both analyte and
marker are non-competitively amplified.
Quantitative PCR reactions using the co-amplification of an internal standard
have been described in Wang et al., PNAS, USA, 86, 9717-9721, 1989and
WO 91/02817. WO 92/01812 relates to a quantitative PCR method using
biotinylated primers. This method cannot be applied to transcription based
amplification techniques, since in transcription based amplification
techniques the primers do not become part of the generated RNA
transcripts. Another quantitative DNA amplification method is described in
WO 93/10257, which is

A method for the detection of RNA obtained by way of amplification
from a target sequence present in an analyte nucleic acid sequence

using a transcription based amplification method wherein, prior to
amplification, an internal control is added, that differs from the target

it can be amplified with the same amplification reagents as the analyte
nucleic acid.
Method according to claim 1 wherein the internal control comprises
the same primer binding sites as the analyte nucleic acid.

of forming a detectable complex with a different complementary
oligonucleotide.
A method according to claim 1, wherein all amplified nucleic acid is
reacted with an enzyme labeled probe capable of hybridizing to both

the RNA generated from the target sequence and the RNA generated
from the internal control sequence to form a complex and

subsequently the complexes thus formed are subjected to gel
electrophoresis to separate them from any remaining free enzyme

labelled probes and the enzyme label in the gel is detected by reacting
the gel with an appropriate enzyme substrate, whereafter the

presence of either complexes comprising the RNA derived from the

A method for the detection of RNA obtained by way of amplification

same amplification reagents as the analyte nucleic acid, is added to a

sample of biological material prior to isolation of the nucleic acid to be
amplified therefrom.
