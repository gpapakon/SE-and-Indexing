<ABSTRACT>
A device for testing line connections (5) at a telephone 
exchange (3) comprises a combined generator and comparator (9) 

for generating a bit sequence of pseudo-random type and for 
comparing a received bit sequence to a generated bit sequence. A 

generated bit sequence is through a line connection (5) 
forwarded to a telephone set (1) and back again to the generator 

and comparator (9), where the received sequence is compared to 
the forwarded one. The number of bit errors occurring in the 

transmission is a measure of the transmission quality of the 
connection. A selector device (11) selects one of several line 

connections which is to be tested, thus only one testing device 
being required for testing a number of line connections (5) 

which through the same pair (17) of one serial output line and 
one serial input line are connected to a telephone exchange (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital switches, in particular
digital private branch exchanges (PBX) or local digital
exchanges and the testing of a connection between a switch and a
subscriber set.In telephone networks such as for instance a private branch
exchange or local digital exchange having telephone sets
connected through line boards, there is always a possibility
that some line will be incorrect due to a faulty attachment,
loosened or oxidized terminal contacts, faults in a line circuit
board, etc. Then some suitable method is used for localizing the
fault, so that for instance an faulty line board can be
replaced. There is thus a general need of simple devices for
testing the quality of a connection.Previously, external instruments have been connected for testing
line connections by means of bit error measurements, i.e. if a
bit sequence transmitted on a line will arrive unchanged to the
source transmitting the sequence.In the published patent application GB-A 2 158 326 a device is
disclosed for testing a digital exchange, in particular a
connection between the exchange and a subscriber set. A bit
sequence formed from pseudo random numbers is transmitted from
the exchange on a channel and is transmitted back from a desired
point in the connecting path between the exchange and the
subscriber set. After each retransmission the bit sequence is
tested and its state will indicate if there is a fault. By a
successive use of several different retransmitting positions
along the connection path the position of a fault can be
determined.In the patent US-A 4,070,554 a digital telephone system is
disclosed comprising a test center for digitally testing the
lines between an exchange and the telephone sets. A digital test
signal transmitted from the test center is modified in a 
telephone set at the end of a line under test in a particular
way and the modified signal is transmitted back to the exchange.
At the test center, the returned signal is compared with a
similarly modified non-transmitted test signal. The test center
can be located anywhere in the telephone system, allowing any
selected subscriber line to be selected for a test. The center
is not physically connected to any particular group of
subscriber line connections.A test equipment which also is centrally connected to a digital
network is disclosed in the published patent application JP-A
59-109070, publ. No. 60-251751.It is a purpose of the invention to provide a simple and cost-saving
device for testing line connections to telephone sets

<CLAIMS>
A testing device for testing line connections at a digital telephone
exchange,


the digital telephone exchange being arranged for the transfer of digital
information and comprising


line circuits (15), each line circuit being intended for
connection through a line to a subscriber set (1) and for forwarding

bit sequences to and from this subscriber set (1),
pairs of input and output lines (5), each pair of one input line
and one output line being connected to a group of line circuits,

each group comprising at least two line circuits, thus on each
pair of lines information being intended to be transmitted to

and from subscriber sets (1) connected to the line circuits (15) of the
corresponding group, the digital information being transmitted

as bit sequences on the lines,
the testing device (27,32) comprising

a generator (9) for generating a bit sequence,
a comparator (9) for the comparison of a received bit sequence
to a generated bit sequence,
means (32) for indicating if the comparison as a result gives an
agreement or not,
characterized in
 that the testing device (27,32)
is connected to only one pair of an input and an output line
of the digital telephone exchange and
comprises means (21,23;31) for insertion in a data stream on the
output line and for extraction (34, 36) from a data stream on the input

line of the pair, bit sequences transmitted to and from a
selected one of the line circuits.
A testing device according to claim 1 in a digital telephone
exchange, in which communication from the exchange to a group of

several line circuits is performed by means of a time
multiplexed serial transmission, such that each line circuit (15) and

thereby a connected subscriber set (1) is always assigned fixed,
periodical time slots, 
characterized in
 that the insertion and
extraction means are controlled by a signal, in such a way that

after the reception of the signal it directly transmits a
portion of a bit sequence generated by the generator and having 

a predetermined length corresponding to a part of or a whole
