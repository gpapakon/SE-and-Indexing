<ABSTRACT>
The method performs automatic determination of a suitable address for an operating unit (1, 2, 3, 8, 9) connected to other similar operating units by a bidirectional communication space (4). The address chosen is the one with rank immediately above that of the address of highest rank already allocated. Each operating unit connected to the space has the said address of highest rank in memory. When a unit needs to adopt an address, the others inform it of the address of highest rank. When the unit has chosen its address, the others update their already allocated address of highest rank memory. Use to avoid the operator being forced to make a coherent choice of multiple addresses, for example in a network of domestic appliances, and to preclude the search for an available address greatly encumbering the communication space and/or culminating in the adoption of the address of another unit which is merely temporarily absent.
