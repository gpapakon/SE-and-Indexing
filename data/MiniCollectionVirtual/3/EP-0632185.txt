<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a roller-blind box (1) having a housing (2) which exhibits an inner wall (3), two side walls (5) and a box base (35), and having a shaft (9) which is mounted in the housing (2) and by the rotation of which a roller blind can be wound up and unwound. According to the invention, the roller-blind box is distinguished in that there is provided a thin-walled profiled covering plate (7) which serves to cover the roller-blind box (1) towards the outside. The roller-blind box according to the invention achieves the advantage that, after installation, jutting-out to a great extent on the one hand, and jutting-out of the inner wall of the roller-blind box beyond the adjacent wall of the building, on the other hand, are avoided, additional corresponding construction work or overhanging likewise being avoided.

preceding claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the

equalising part (17, 117, 217) is composed of at least two
layers (25, 27; 125, 127; 225, 227), wherein one layer (25,

125, 225) is formed from a material which bonds to plaster,
such as plasterboard, for example. 
Roller shutter box according to at least one of the
preceding claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the inner

wall (3, 103, 203) is connected to the box bottom (35) in a
separable manner.
