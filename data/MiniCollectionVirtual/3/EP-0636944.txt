<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a positive charge director (15) for liquid 
electrographic toners. The charge director (15) comprises a very strongly 

cheating functional group (13) covalently bonded in the resin coating or pigment 
component, or an intrinsic part of the pigment component, of the toner particle 

(11), and a very weakly associated, preferably ionic, molecule (14) dispersed in 
the liquid phase (17) to achieve charge separation. The strong chelation site 

(13) on the resin is prepared, via well-known polymer chemistry. For the ionic 
molecule (14), preferred cations are those with no regulatory, health or 

environmental issues, such as K +, Na +, Ca²⁺, Al³⁺, Zn²⁺, Zr⁴⁺, Mg²⁺, 
ammonium (NH₄+), and organic cations. 
The chelate-containing resin is brought into dispersion with the 
liquid phase (17) containing the ionic molecule (14). When this is done, the 

equilibria that compete for the cation are such that it is released from the ionic 
molecule (14) and bound in the chelate (13). The toner particle (15) is left with 

a net positive charge which is permanent, but which is balanced by an equal, 
opposite charge on the counter anionic species (16) in the continuous phase 

(17). Preferably, there are no other sources of charge in the dispersion, and 
there is no excess of charge carriers in the continuous phase which would interfere 

with development.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to liquid toner dispersions of the 
type used in electrophotography. More specifically, the invention relates to 
toner particles containing a strongly chelating component which act as charge 
directors left with a net positive charge after contact with a cation in the liquid 
toner dispersions. In electrophotography, a latent image is created on the surface of a 
photoconducting material by selectively exposing areas of the charged surface to 
light. A difference in electrostatic charge density is created between the areas 
on the surface exposed and unexposed to light. The visible image is developed 
by electrostatic toners containing pigment components and thermoplastic 
components. The toners are selectively attracted to the photoconductor surface 
either exposed or unexposed to light, depending on the relative electrostatic 
charges of the photoconductor surface, development electrode and the toner. 
The photoconductor may be either positively or negatively charged, and the 
toner system similarly may contain negatively or positively charged particles. 
For laser printers, the preferred embodiment is that the photoconductor and 
toner have the same polarity, but different levels of charge. A sheet of paper or intermediate transfer medium is then given an 
electrostatic charge opposite that of the toner and passed close to the 
photoconductor surface, pulling the toner from the photoconductor surface onto 
the paper or intermediate medium, still in the pattern of the image developed 
from the photoconductor surface. A set of fuser rollers fixes the toner to the 
paper, subsequent to direct transfer, or indirect transfer when using an intermediate 
transfer medium, producing the printed image. The toner may be in the form of a dust, i.e., powder, or a pigment 
in a resinous carrier, i.e., toner, as described, for examples in Giaimo, U.S.  
 
Patent No. 2,786,440, issued March 26, 1957. The toner particles may be 
used or fixed to the surface by known means such as heat or solvent vapor, or 
they may be transferred to another surface to which they may similarly be fixed, 
to produce a permanent reproduction of the original radiation pattern. Dry development systems suffer from the disadvantage that 
distribution of the powder on the surface of the photoconductor, and the charge 
to mass ratio of the particles, are difficult to control. They can have the further 
disadvantages that excessive amounts of dust may be generated and that high 
resolution is difficult to
