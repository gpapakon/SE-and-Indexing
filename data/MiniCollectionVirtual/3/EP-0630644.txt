<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medicine and, more 
specifically, to an antimicrobial and interferon-inducing 
medicament. Widely known in the prior art is administration of para-aminobenzenesulfamide 
(Streptocidum album, Sulfanilamidum), 
one of the chemotherapeutic preparations of sulfanilamide 
group. The preparation exerts an antimicrobial effect with 
relation to streptococcus, meningococcus, genecoccus, pneumococcus, 
colibacillus and some other bacteria. Said preparation 
is utilized predominantly in a tablet form. Injection 
forms of said preparation presuppose their conversion into 
soluble salts, for example, the formation of soluble compounds 
through a primary aromatic group. However, this structure is 
unstable and calls for introducing a stabilizer, i.e. toxic 
sodium sulfite (M.D. Mashkovsky "Medicinal Drugs", Moscow, 
"Meditsina", 1984, vol. 2, p. 275-277; G.A. Melentieva, 
"Pharmaceutical Chemistry", Moscow,, "Meditsina", 1986, p. 
285-286). In addition, the antimicrobial effect of said preparation 
is exhibited only in, presence of an open aminogroup 
in a para-position to the sulfanilamide group, so that the 
degree of its opening and, consequently, its antimicrobial  
 
effect well depend on time and on physiological constants of 
blood. This currently-used preparation in a soluble form 
(Streptocidum Solubile) features a number of negative properties, 
such as side effects associated with administration of 
a toxic stabilizer, irritant effect, low biological availability. It is common knowledge that para-aminobenzenesulfanilamide 
can crystallize in the form of three polymorphic modifications 
designated by α -, β -, γ -forms (Journal of Pharmaceutical 
Sciences, v. 58, 59, No. 7, July 1970, p. 972-975; 
Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Japan, 1942, m.63, 
No.11, p. 17-19) of which only α -form is used in practical 
medicine. The pharmacokinetic properties of the crystalline 
γ -modification of para-aminobenzenesulfanilamide 
have not been described. The use of γ -modification as an 
active principle of the medicament is unknown. Besides, 
the use of α -, β - and γ -modifications of para-aminobenzenesulfanilamide 
in the capacity of interferon 
inducers is not known either. It is common knowledge that all inducers of interferon, 
the most important factor of nonspecific resistance of cells, 
are divided into two groups, viz., natural (viruses and natural 
two-spiral nucleic acids) and synthetic (polymers and low-molecular 
preparations) (F.I. Ershov et al, collected works
