<ABSTRACT>
Corner-cupboard hinge (30) for the articulation of the free part-leaf (14b) on the part-leaf (14a), of a two-part corner-cupboard door leaf (14), which, for its part, is pivotably fastened, by means of a hinge, on the load-bearing wall of the body of the piece of furniture. The hinge (30) exhibits two fastening parts which are each assigned to the part-leaves and are in the form of a hinge pot (38), arranged in one of the door leaves, and of a hinge arm (34) which is mounted pivotably in the hinge pot and is adjustably fastened on the other part-leaf. Provided in the region of the mounting of the hinge arm (34) in the hinge pot (38) is a tumbler device which prestresses the part-leaves, in the closed position of the door leaf (14), into a part-leaf position assuming an angle of slightly more than 90@. The tumbler device exhibits a pressure-exerting piece, which is mounted displaceably in the hinge pot and is prestressed in the direction of that end of the hinge arm which is mounted in the hinge pot, and a control surface which is formed at said end of the hinge arm and on which the pressure-exerting piece acts.

<CLAIMS>
A hinge (60) for articulating the free part-leaf (14b) of a two-part
corner cupboard door leaf (14) on the carcase-articulated part-leaf which

is in turn pivotally hung on the carcase support wall by means of a hinge,
consisting of two door-hanging parts respectively associated with the part-leaves,

which door-hanging parts are pivotable through about 90° out of
the position in which they hold the part-leaves (14a, 14b) approximately at

right angles to one another in the closed position of the corner cupboard,
into a position of substantially parallel alignment when the corner

cupboard door leaf (14) is open, one of the door-hanging parts comprising
a hinge holder (38) which is adapted to be fixed in one of the part-leaves

and in which a multi-cranked hinge arm (64) adapted to be adjustably
fixed on the other part-leaf is mounted by its free end so as to be pivotable

on a bearing pin (40) provided in the hinge holder (38), and a closure
means is provided in the zone where the hinge arm is mounted in the

hinge holder and biases the free part-leaf (14b) into a position occupying
an angle of somewhat more than 90° relative to the carcase-articulated

first part-leaf (14a), the hinge arm (64) being made up of a total of three
releasably interconnected and longitudinally consecutive portions (64a,

64b, 64c), of which the bearing arm portion (64a) pivotally mounted in the
hinge holder (38) is connected for movement in a first co-ordinate

direction to the middle connecting arm portion (64b) and the middle
connecting arm portion (64b) is connected for movement in a direction at

right angles to the first co-ordinate direction to the mounting arm portion
(64c) non-rotatably hung on the other part-leaf and the mounting arm

portion (64c) is in turn mounted for movement substantially at right angles
to the said co-ordinate directions on a mounting element fixed on the

associated part-leaf (14b), characterised in that

the mounting element comprises a seating (66) for an associated fixing
surface (102) provided on the mounting arm portion (64c) and in that the

fixing surface (74) is formed with a slot (76) through which passes the 
shank of a fixing screw (78) screwable into a tapped bore (68) in the

seating (66),
in that the facing seating and fixing surfaces (66; 102) are respectively
formed with parallel grooves which extend at right angles to the slot (76)

and which can be forced into positive engagement by tightening of the
fixing screw (78),
in that fixing surfaces (100; 88) which can be brought into abutment with
one another are provided on the mounting arm portion (64c) and in the

connecting arm portion (64b), and in that one of the arm portions is
formed with a slot (92) through which passes the shank of a fixing screw

(94) screwable into a screwthread (96) in the fixing surface of the other
arm portion, and
in that the facing fixing surfaces (100; 88) are respectively formed with
parallel grooves which extend at right angles to the slot (92) and which

can be forced into positive engagement on the tightening of the fixing
screw (94).
A hinge according to claim 1, characterised in that fixing surfaces
(82; 74) which are adapted to be brought into abutment with one another

are provided in the connecting arm portion (64b) and in the bearing arm
portion (64a), and in that one of the arm portions is formed with a slot (76)

through which passes the shank of a fixing screw (78) screwable into a
screwthread in the fixing surface of the other arm portion.
A hinge according to claim 2, characterised in that the facing fixing
surfaces (82; 74) of the connecting arm portion (64b) and of the bearing

arm portion (64a) respectively are provided with parallel grooves which
extend at right angles to the slot (76) and which are adapted to be forced

into positive engagement by tightening of the fixing screw (78). 
A hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the mounting element in the form of a hinge holder is countersunk in the

associated part-leaf (14b).
A hinge according to claim 4, characterised in that the mounting
element which holds the mounting arm portion (64c) and which is

countersunk in the associated part-leaf (14b), and the hinge holder (38)
pivotally mounting the bearing arm portion (64a) are constructed as

identical components which have both bores to receive a bearing pin (40)
in the holder interior and also a seating (66) for adjustable mounting of a

mounting arm portion (64c).
A hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
the co-ordinate direction determining the direction of movement between

the bearing arm portion (64a) and the connecting arm portion (64b) and
the co-ordinate direction determining the direction of movement between

the mounting arm portion (64c) and the mounting element are respectively
aligned at right angles and the co-ordinate direction determining the

direction of movement between the connecting arm portion (64b) and the
mounting arm portion (64c) is aligned parallel to the longitudinal centreline

of the bearing pin (40).
A hinge according to claim 6, characterised in that a measuring
scale (112) allowing the relative position to which the parts have been

adjusted to be read off is provided on the bearing arm portion (64a) and
on the connecting arm portion (64b) and a reference marker (114) is

provided on the other arm portion.
A hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that
a measuring scale (108) allowing the relative position to which the parts

have been adjusted to be read off is provided on the mounting arm portion
(64c) and on the mounting 
element which holds it, and a reference marker
(110) is provided on the other part. 
A hinge according to claims 7 and 8, characterised in that the
measuring scale (112; 108) bears measurement numerals which allow the
