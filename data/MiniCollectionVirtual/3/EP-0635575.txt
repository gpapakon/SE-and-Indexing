<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel hybridoma cell lines 
which produce monoclonal antibodies that bind epitopes 

found in the free form of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) 
but not in PSA complexed to α₁-antichymotrypsin. PSA is a 

serine protease with a molecular mass of 33 kDa found as a 
specific cancer marker of prostatic cancer. The antibodies 

recognize their epitopes on the zymogen as well as on the 
active enzyme but the epitope is hidden by their specific 

inhibitor α₁-antichymotrypsin (ACT), normally found in human 
serum. The hybridomas are produced by fusing an immortal 

cell, a cell having the ability to replicate indefinitely 
in myeloma cell culture (NS-1, P3x63-Ag8,45.6 Tg), and an 

effector immune cell following immunization of the immune 
host with PSA isolated from patient material. 
 
The monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cell 
line
s of the present invention are useful in the detection 
of free form of PSA which is important in screening of the 

patient material to distinguish carcinoma of the prostate 
(CAP) from less fatal benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides novel hybridoma cell lines 
which produce monoclonal antibodies that bind epitopes 
found in free form of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) but 
not in PSA compelexed to α₁-antichymotrypsin. The publications and other materials used herein to 
illuminate the background of the invention , and in 
particular, cases to provide additional details respecting 
the practice, are incorporated by reference. The present invention relates to carcinoma of the prostate 
(CAP) that is the most common malignant disease among males 
in Europe and in the US. The risk to develop CAP increases 
significantly with age, and the lifetime risk to develop 
clinically significant CAP is estimated to be 10%. More 
than 30% of men diagnosed to have CAP will eventually die 
from the disease. The early detection of organ confined 
prostatic cancer provides on opportunity to radical 
treatment of disease. When the tumor is spread outside the 
prostate the prognosis is poor and there is no use for 
radical treatments. At diagnosis, CAP is found to be spread 
outside the gland in about 50% of cases. If cancer has 
metastased, the prognosis after hormone treatment is about 
20-30% in five years if patient has local disease the 
survival is close to 60% (Blom J. Available screening tests 
for prostatic cancer. In: Miller A., Chamberlain J., Day 
N., Hakama M., propok R. ed. Cancer screening. Cambridge 
UICC, Cambridge University Press, 1991: 294-299). That is 
why it is possible to reduce death by performing a prostate 
cancer-related early diagnosis of the disease. However, it has recently been shown that early detection of  
 
CAP can be made using procedure that includes serum PSA 
measurement, digital rectal examination (DRE) and 
transrectal ultrasonography (Catalona WJ., Smith DS., 
Ratliff TL., Dodds KM., Coplen DE., Yuan JJ., et al. 
Measurement of prostate-specific antigen in serum as a 
screening test for prostate cencer. NEngl J Med 1991; 324: 
1156-61; Chadwick DJ., Kemple T., Astley JP., MacIver AG., 
Gillatt DA., Adams P., Gingell JC. Pilot study of screening 
for prostate cancer in general practice. Lancet 1991; 338: 
613-6). Low levels of prostate derived PSA (about 10⁻⁶ of that in 
the seminal fluid) normally occur in serum from adult 
males, but abnormally high levels are regularly detected in 
prostate disease. PSA measurements are widely used to 
monitor disease progress, evaluate therapeutic response, 
and detect early recurrence after radical treatment of CAP.
