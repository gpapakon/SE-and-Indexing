<ABSTRACT>
A two station machine (26) forms a parison from a plastic resin and 
then stretch blowing into a hollow-molded product. The machine has a 

preform station (3) for forming a parison (57) and blow mold station 
(32) for stretching and inflating the parison (57) into the hollow 

molded object and then ejecting the hollow-molded product from the 
machine. The preform station (3) and the blow mold station (32) are 

disposed at diametrically opposite locations on a circumference of a 
circle. A transfer portion (34) has a transfer head (74) rotatable about 

an axis extending through the center the circle and having pair of 
identical transfer stations (108,110) located at diametrically opposite 

locations with respect to the axis. An indexer (94) rotated the transfer 
head (74) between two aligned positions in which one of the transfer 

stations (108,110) is in registry with the preform station (3) and the 
other transfer station (108,110) is in registry with the blow mold 

station (32). Each transfer station (108,110) has at least one parison 
engaging and retaining neck mold (112) for engaging the parison (57) 

formed at the preform station (3) and retaining the parison (57) for 
transfer from the preform station (3) to the blow mold station (32) upon 

rotation of the transfer portion from one to other of the two positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an injection stretch blow molding machine, and more
particularly to a two-station machine wherein the second station is capable of
stretching and blowing the parison into a hollow-molded product and then ejecting the
hollow-molded product from the machine.It is known to have blow molding machines wherein a plastic resin is converted
into a hollow-molded product. A parison is formed at a first station. The parison is
moved to a second station where the finished product is formed. The finished product
is then moved to a third station where it is ejected from the machine. Such a
machine is disclosed in GB-A-2017565. Sometimes, additional intermediate stations
are employed, and machines having four stations are not uncommon. A transfer plate
or disk rotates in relation to the stations to move the parison through the stations to
form the finished product and then eject it from the machine. The rotating transfer
plate or disk has molds to hold a portion of the parison, usually the upper or neck
portion, as it moves the parison from station to station.It is also known to form multiple products at the same station at the same time.
The mold cavities in the blow mold section typically are in two rows, where the
first row is radially inward of the second row. The mold has a pair of mold halves
defining the cavity which open and close radially. Thus, the mold halves in the 
closed position must be sufficiently spaced from the center of the disk to allow the
mold half to move radially inward upon opening.It would be desirable to have a injection stretch blow molding machine requiring
fewer than three stations in order to minimize machine size and time spent
transferring the parison from station to station.This invention provides a machine for forming hollow molded objects by injection
stretch blow molding comprising a preform station for forming a plurality of parisons,
a blow mold station for stretching and inflating the parisons into the hollow molded
objects and then ejecting the hollow molded objects from the machine, the preform
station and the blow mold station being disposed at diametrically opposite locations on
a circumference of a circle, a transfer portion having a transfer head rotatable about
an axis through the centre of the circle and having a pair of identical transfer stations
located at diametrically opposite locations with respect to the axis, a lift and an index
drive for raising, rotating and then lowering the transfer head between two aligned
positions in which one of

A machine (26) for forming hollow molded objects (194) by injection stretch blow
molding comprising a preform station (30) for forming a plurality of parisons (57), a

blow mold station (32) for stretching and inflating the parisons into the hollow
molded objects and then ejecting the hollow molded objects from the machine, the

preform station and the blow mold station being disposed at diametrically opposite
locations on a circumference of a circle, a transfer portion (34) having a transfer head

(74) rotatable about an axis through the centre of the circle and having a pair of
identical transfer stations (108, 110) located at diametrically opposite locations with

respect to the axis, a lift (80) and an index drive (94) for raising, rotating and then
lowering the transfer head (74) between two aligned positions in which one of the

transfer stations is in registry with the preform station and the other transfer station is
in registry with the blow mold station, each transfer station (108, 110) having a

plurality of parison engaging and retaining means (112) for engaging the parisons
formed at the preform station and retaining the parisons for transfer from the preform

station to the blow mold station (32) upon rotation of the transfer portion from one to
another of the two positions. 
A machine as in claim 1 further comprising:

adjustment means (100) for moving the transfer head
between a raised transfer position for rotating the transfer head between the

aligned positions and a lowered operating position for forming the parison and
