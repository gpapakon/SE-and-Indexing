<ABSTRACT>
Woven or laid fabric, in particular for forming prepregs, specifically for fabricating structural components for use in the aircraft industry, made of fibres, preferably carbon fibres, with an elasticity modulus of above 80,000 N/mm
<

, preferably above 200,000 N/mm

, and a specific weight of preferably 1.5 g/cm
<

, the fibres consisting of single filaments and these, and thus also the woven or laid fabric, being optionally flattened, preferably rolled. To obtain a woven or laid fabric which has particularly high mechanical strength and yet is economical to manufacture, it is proposed that each fibre consists of at least 2000, preferably 3000, single filaments (3K = 200 tex = 200 g/1000 m). The woven or laid fabric is preferably used for forming prepregs and lightweight structural components, especially for the aircraft industry, advantageously overhead storage (stowage) compartments (bins) in particular.
