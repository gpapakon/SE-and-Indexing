<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lever-type hoist and 
traction apparatus in which an operation handle 18 is 

provided between a stopper 17 provided at the axial end 
portion of a driving shaft 5 and a driving member 8 screwed 

in the driving shaft 5 so as to be movable in the axial 
direction but unrotatable relatively to the driving shaft 

5. A spring 19 for energizing the operation handle 18 
toward the driving member 8 is provided to bring an 

inclined surface 31a of the engaging projection 31 provided 
on the operation handle 18 into elastic contact with an 

engaging stepped portion 37 of the driving member 8 during 
the time when the mechanical brake 13 is being operated, 

whereby the driving member 8 can be prevented from being 
reversely rotated with being accompanied by the returning 

operation of the operation lever 16 by the engaging 
resistance of the feed click 14 during the time when the 

hoist and traction is being conduction under the no-load 
condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lever-type hoist and
traction apparatus, in particular to a lever-type hoist and
traction apparatus provided with an operation lever having a
feed click and adapted to conduct a hoist and traction of
loads by driving a load-sheave through a mechanical brake by
a reciprocating operation of said operation lever.In a lever-type hoist and traction apparatus provided
with an operation lever, as disclosed in for example
Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. Hei
3-107490, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporaed by
reference, a driving shaft is provided with a driving member
having teeth on its outer periphery screwed therein. In
addition, said operation lever is provided with a feed click
engaged with said teeth of said driving member so as to be
switched over, a click portion on the, feed side of the
driving member being engaged with the teeth and the
operation lever being reciprocally operated to forwardly
screw the driving member, whereby operating a mechanical
brake, a driving power due to a reciprocal operation of the
operation lever being transmitted to a load-sheave from said
driving shaft through said mechanical brake, and the load-sheave
being driven to conduct a hoist and traction of
loads. Furthermore a click portion on the return side of
the feed click is engaged with the teeth of the driving 
member to reciprocally operate the operation lever, whereby
rearwardly screwing the driving member and thus releasing
the operation of the mechanical brake to reversely rotate
the load-sheave by a quantity rearwardly screwed of the
driving member in order to unload or release a traction.However, in said lever-type hoist and traction
apparatus having the above described construction, the
driving member is adapted to be regularly and reversely
rotated by engaging one of the portion on the feed side and
the return side of the feed click provided on the operation
lever with the teeth provided on said outer periphery of the
driving member and reciprocally operating the operation
lever and the driving member is forwardly screwed by this
regular rotation to operate the mechanical brake and
transmit the driving power due to the reciprocal operation
of the operation lever to the load-sheave from the driving
shaft, whereby driving the load-sheave to be rotated, so
that a disadvantage occurs in that in the case where no load
is applied to the load-sheave, the driving member is
forwardly screwed to operate the mechanical brake and
consequently, even though the operation

<CLAIMS>
A lever-type hoist and traction apparatus comprising
a load-sheave (3), a driving shaft (5) having a driven

member (7) for driving said load-sheave (3), a driving
member (8) provided with teeth (8a) on an outer periphery

thereof and screwed in said driving shaft (5), and an
operation lever (16) provided with a mechanical brake (13)

and a feed click (14) switchably engaged with said teeth
(8a) for driving said driving member (8) in regular and

reverse directions by a reciprocal operation whereby
rotation in the regular direction operates the mechanical

brake, further comprising a stopper (17) provided at an
axial end portion of the driving shaft (5), an operation

handle (18) movable in the axial direction but unrotatable
relatively to the driving shaft (5) and provided between

said stopper (17) and the driving member (8), a spring (19)
for energizing said operation handle (18) toward the

driving member (8), at least one engaging projection (31)
projecting toward the driving member (8) provided on a

surface of the operation handle (18) facing the driving
member (8), and at least one engaging stepped portion (37)

with which the or each said projection (31) is engaged
provided on the driving member (8) on a surface facing the

operation handle (18), 
characterised by
 there being
provided an inclined surface (31a) provided on the surface

of the operation handle (18) facing the driving member (8)
and inclined toward an axial extremity of an at least one

engaging projection (31) in the direction of regular
rotation of the driving member (8) so as to bring said

inclined surface (31a) into elastic contact with said
engaging stepped portion (37) by an energizing force of

said spring (19) when said mechanical brake (13) is being
operated.
