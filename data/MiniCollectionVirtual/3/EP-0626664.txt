<ABSTRACT>
In order to simplify the manufacture of terminals utilising IC cards, there is provision to place within these terminals a minimum instruction set and to transfer the storage of complementary instructions relating to more complex usage and/or usage of the IC card over to the IC card. In order to execute these complementary instructions, an address pointing to an instruction of a complementary set is stored in a reserved memory of the IC card. The microprocessor of the IC card is furnished additionally with a microprogram compelling the execution of an instruction thus pointed at once it has been detected that the reserved memory has been designated by an instruction from an elementary instruction set for this microprocessor. It is shown that in this way the manufacture of very powerful terminals can be simplified and rationalised.

A communication system comprising:

- a server centre (1), an electronic chip (2) carried by a chip support (3) and an interface (4) for communication between this server centre, this chip and possibly a user,
- in the interface, a microprocessor (9) and a program memory (11) provided with a limited set (11) of instructions or procedures for communication with the chip, and
- in the chip, a microprocessor (14) and a program memory (15) also provided with a corresponding limited set (16) of instructions or procedures, 
characterised in that
 the communication system comprises
- means arranged so as, from a message sent by the server centre, during a utilisation session, to select or write, in a reserved memory area (20) of the chip, with the limited sets of instructions or procedures of the interface, the characteristics of an instruction different from those of the limited sets or procedures of this interface, and
- in the chip an automatic execution controller arranged so as, during this session, to execute this different instruction after the selection or writing of its characteristics in this reserved memory area.
A system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
- the program memory of the chip comprises a complementary set of instructions,
- the written characteristics concern an address, in this program memory of the chip, of an instruction of this complementary set.
A system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the automatic controller comprises, in the program memory of the chip,

- a microprogram (37-40) for testing whether an instruction, received from the server or user, belongs to the limited set of instructions, coupled with an execution of this tested instruction, connected in series with
- a microprogram (42) for testing the designation, in the instruction thus executed, of the reserved memory area, coupled with the execution of the different instruction.
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the automatic controller comprises, in the program memory of the chip,

- a microprogram (42) for testing the designation of the reserved memory area, coupled with the execution of the different instruction.
A system according to claim 3 or claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the automatic controller comprises, in the program memory of the chip,

- a microprogram for executing an instruction of the complementary set whose address is stored in the reserved memory area.
A system according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the reserved memory area of the chip is non-volatile, in particular of the EEPROM type.
A system according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the reserved memory area comprises a field (49) for storing information making it possible to know that, after the execution of an instruction different from those in the limited sets or procedures, the execution of another different instruction should follow, and 
in that
 the automatic execution controller comprises a test (50) for the value of this field.
A system according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the microprocessor of the interface is arranged so as to execute the different instruction.
