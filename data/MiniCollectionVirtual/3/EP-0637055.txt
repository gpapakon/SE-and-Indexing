<ABSTRACT>
A plasma processing apparatus (10) has a chamber (12) with an 
open top (14) and a cover plate (22) extending across the 

open top of the chamber. The cover plate (22) has an opening 
(23) therethrough. An annular shield (30) of an electrical 

insulating material is secured to the cover plate (22) around 
the opening (23) and extends partially across the opening. 

An aluminum showerhead (42) is within the shield (30) and has 
holes (44) therethrough through which a gas can pass into the 

chamber (12). The showerhead (42) is connected to a source 
(56) of RF voltage to provide a flow of RF power between the 

showerhead (42) and an electrode (52) within the chamber. 
The shield (30) has a plurality of openings (36) therethrough 

which allows the RF power to flow through the openings from 
the showerhead (42) to the electrode (52) in the event that 

the showerhead (42) becomes coated with particles of an 
insulating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
A plasma processing apparatus, in general, comprises a chamber having 
therein a susceptor for supporting a body to be processed, and a pair of spaced 
electrodes. The susceptor can be one of the electrodes. The other electrode can 
be a showerhead through which various gases are admitted into the chamber to 
generate a plasma in the chamber. The susceptor electrode and the showerhead 
electrode are generally made of aluminum. The showerhead electrode is 
generally connected to a source of RF voltage and the susceptor electrode is 
generally grounded so that rf power is dissipated between the showerhead 
electrode and the susceptor electrode to generate a plasma in the gas in the 
chamber. The particular process achieved in the apparatus depends on the gas or 
gases used. Some gases result in an etching of the body on the susceptor, and 
other gases react to deposit a layer on the body. Such a plasma processing 
apparatus is known from EP-A- 0 296 891. Prior to performing a processing step in the chamber, it is common to 
clean the chamber by passing nitrogen fluoride (NF3) into the chamber. During  
 
this cleaning operation, any aluminum parts in the chamber, such as the 
electrodes, react with the fluorine to form particles of aluminum fluoride (AIF) on 
the surface thereof. Since aluminum fluoride is an insulating material, the 
showerhead electrode then has particles of an insulating material over an exposed 
surface thereof which limit RF power dissipation between the electrodes and thus 
limit a plasma needed for a particular reaction. The plasma reaction in the 
chamber can induce micro-arcing which results in the aluminum fluoride flaking 
off of the showerhead. These particles of aluminum fluoride can deposit on the 
body being processed and thus adversely affect the characteristics of circuitries 
and/or devices being formed in and/or on the body. In order to solve this problem the invention provides a plasma processing 
apparatus according to claim. A particular embodiment of the invention is defined in claim 6. Further advantageous features, 
aspects and details of the invention are evident from the dependent claims, the 
description and the drawings. This invention provides a plasma processing apparatus which limits the 
formation of contaminating particles, such as particles of aluminum fluoride (AIF), 
which reach a body being processed. Viewed from one aspect, the present invention is directed to plasma 
processing apparatus comprising a processing chamber, first and second spaced 
apart
