<DESCRIPTION>
THIS IS A CONTINUATION-IN-PART OF APPLICATION
SERIAL NO. 09/458,711 FILED ON DECEMBER 13, 1999.The present invention relates to a method and a device for coupling
spectacles and clip-on sunshades with each other, and more particularly,
the present invention relates to a method and a device for coupling
spectacles and clip-on sunshades with each other, which enable
sunglasses referred to as "clip-on sunshades" not having arms to
be detachably coupled to spectacles.Generally, spectacles are used for the purpose of enhancing
the eyesight of a person who has defective vision. Sunglasses help
to protect the eyes from strong light which may cause damage to the
eyes. Ordinary spectacles comprise lens frames connected together
at their inner ends by a nose frame, lenses fitted into respective
lens frames, and arms mounted to outer ends of the lens frames through
hinges.Eyesight is divided into normal eyesight, nearsightedness,
farsightedness and astigmatism. If incoming parallel lights are
imaged such that an image is focused in front of the retina,
nearsightedness (myopia) exists, whereby an observer can properly 
view close objects, but has a poor view of distant objects.
By utilizing concave lenses within spectacles, nearsightedness can
be adequately corrected. If incoming parallel lights are imaged
such that an image is focused behind the retina, farsightedness
(hyperopia) exists, whereby an observer has a poor view of close
objects, but can properly view distant objects. In the case of
astigmatism, due to the fact that a spherical surface of the eyeball,
especially the cornea, is not even, incoming parallel lights cannot
be focused directly to a point on the retina, whereby an observer
cannot properly focus his eyesight.While, as described above, spectacles are used for enhancing
the eyesight of a person who has defective vision, in hot summer
weather when ultraviolet rays dominate, a spectacle wearer requires
sunglasses with corrective lenses.In other words, unlike non-prescription sunglasses which are
worn by persons who do not have vision defects, in the case of persons
who wear spectacles due to an ocular refractive error, separate
sunglasses having vision-corrective lenses of a power which corresponds
to that of the user's normal spectacle lenses must be used, which
can be expensive.To cope with this problem, clip-on sunshades which do not have
arms and to which tinted lenses are mounted, are attached in front 
of the spectacles, thereby rendering the same vision enhancing effect
as can be achieved by
