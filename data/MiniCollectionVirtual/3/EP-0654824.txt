<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic discharge (hereafter referred to as 
"ESD") protection device (130) is disclosed for use with 

semiconductor chip packaging (hereafter referred to as 
"SCP"). The electrostatic protection device comprises 

electrically conductive shorting devices (132,134,136,138) 
that may be removably connected to the SCP (104) during the 

manufacture to short selected pins from the SCP. The ESD 
protection device (130) remains in place to provide ESD 

protection during all phases of handling and shipping and 
may be either automatically unshorted or be manually 

removed during final assembly when the SCP is installed in 
its end product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrostatic discharge
(hereafter referred to as "ESD") protection device for
various semiconductor chip packages (hereinafter referred
to as "SCP") of the type having a plurality of connector
pins which are either (a) continuously shorted and then,
upon insertion of the connector pins into complementary
receptacles, automatically unshorted or (b) continuously
shorted until the physical removal of the ESD protection
device from the SCP.For a plurality of connector pins of a SCP which mates
with a corresponding plurality of receptacles in a
connector, typically, a printed circuit board, it is
frequently necessary to short together the connector pins
of the SCP until they are inserted into complementary
receptacles in the connector in order to protect the
semiconductor's circuity from ESD. Present ESD protection
devices consist primarily of ESD packaging of the SCP in
electrically conductive strips, pellets, boxes and plastic
tubing which provides effective ESD protection until the
user is about to insert the connector pins of the SCP into
the complementary receptacles in the connector. At that
point, however, the user must remove this ESD packaging
from the SCP, thus rendering the SCP vulnerable to ESD, in
order to position and insert the connector pins into the
receptacles. Accordingly, as the user inserts the
connector pins of the SCP into the receptacles, the
semiconductor dies housed within these SCP's could be
destroyed by ESD and would have to be replaced. Moreover,
certain types of SCPs typically EPROMs, UVPROMS, and DRAMs,
are plug-in devices which have connector pins which are
repeatedly inserted into and then removed from the
receptacles. These types of SCPs require ESD protection
during the repeated insertions into and removals from the
receptacles. Specifically, the connector pins of these
SCPs require ESD protection from the moment that their
connector pins are removed from the receptacles till their 
connector pins are again inserted therein. Consequently,
a need still exists within the semiconductor chip packaging
industry for a true ESD protection device, rather than ESD
packaging, which effectively protects the semiconductor die
from ESD until the connector pins of the SCP are inserted
into the receptacles of the connector and then protects the
semiconductor die from ESD again when the connector pins
are removed from their respective receptacles.DE-OS-2348630 describes a method and device for
protecting devices from damage due to electro-static
charges by

An electrostatic discharge protection device (130) in
combination with a semiconductor chip package (104) of the

type having a top surface (106) and opposite bottom surface
and a plurality of interface surfaces (108,110,112,114)

disposed between the top and bottom surfaces, each
interface surface having a plurality of connector pins

respect to a respective plurality of connector pins extending from
a respective interface surface; and
b) a spring structure (140) mounted to the top
surface of the semiconductor chip package for urging the

plurality of electrically conductive bars against the

i) a central pad (142) securely mounted to the top
surface of the semiconductor chip package; and
ii) a plurality of spring members (144,146,148,150)

two spaced apart depending leg portions (154,156) integral
to the cantiievered portion and extending downwardly on

both sides of a respective plurality of connector

portion (152) and the two depending leg portions (154, 156) of each spring
member defining an interface therebetween adjacent which a

respective one of the plurality of electrically conductive

comprising means for yieldably biasing the spring member to 
move the cantilevered portion thereof towards the top

surface of the semiconductor chip package so as to urge the
electrically conductive bar associated therewith against

its respective plurality of connector pins
thereby creating an electrical interconnection

therebetween.

adhesive for securely mounting the central pad (142) to the

top surface (106).

selected from the group comprising an elastic, electrically
conductive foam, plastic, fiber and foil.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that

A device according to claim 1, in combination with a connector (124) for connecting the semiconductor chip package, wherein the spring
members and the connector (124) are constructed such that when the semiconductor chip package is

positioned against the surface (126) of the connector, each
cantilevered portion moves away from the top surface of the

semiconductor chip package against its yieldable bias so as to disengage its
electrically conductive bar from its respective plurality

of connector pins on the interface surface to break the
electrical connection therebetween.
