<DESCRIPTION>
 SeatingThis invention relates to seating, e.g. for domestic purposes, and more particularly to the construction of the arms of seats (including armchairs and sofas) .It is common for armchairs and sofas to have arms of a roll-form. The construction of these arms is quite complex and involves several layers of padding material etc. built up to the required shape, each layer being fixed in position: this procedure is carried out by hand.We have now devised a simplified construction for the arms of seats (including armchairs and sofas) .In accordance with this invention there is provided a seat having a frame which includes opposite side panels and moulded plastics arm preforms fitted to the respective side panels. The moulded plastics arm preforms are preferably shaped substantially to the desired profile of the arms of the seat, so that when the frame is upholstered to complete the seat, it is a simple matter to cover the arms.Preferably each arm preform includes a slot into which the top edge of the respective side panel of the seat frame fits..Also in accordance with this invention, there is provided a moulded plastics arm preform for fitting to a side panel of a seat frame. Preferably the preform comprises a rotational moulding.An embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:FIGURE 1 is a view of a seat frame and (from its inner side) a moulded plastics arm preform for fitting to one arm of the seat frame;FIGURE 2 is a view of the preform from its outer side; andFIGURE 3 is a cross-section through the preform. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, there is shown a frame for an armchair, the frame being constructed from rigid panels of wood, e.g. chipboard, including opposite side panels 10, 12 which have top edges 11, 13 at arm-rest level. 

 A moulded plastics arm preform, e.g. 30, is to be fitted to each side panel 10, 12. The preform 30 has a generally tubular portion 32 from which a hollow side portion 34 extends. The tubular portion 32 is formed with a slot 36 along its underside, at its junction with the side portion 34. The arm preform 30 fits over the top edge of the side panel, e.g. 12, with the top edge of the panel passing into the slot 36 and abutting the inside-top of the tubular portion 32. The side portion 34 of the preform 30 fits against the inner surface of the side panel 12 and extends, in the example shown, down to the level of a seat platform 18 of the frame. The front end of the preform

CLAIMS
1) A seat having a frame which includes opposite side panels (10,12) and moulded plastics arm preforms (30) fitted to the side panels.
2) A seat as claimed in claim 1, in which each arm preform 5 includes a slot (36) into which a top edge (11 or 13) of the respective side panel (10 or 12) of the seat frame fits.
3) A seat as claimed in claim 1 or 2 , in which each arm preform (30) comprises a generally tubular portion (32) from which a hollow side portion (34) extends downwardly against an
10 inner side of the respective side panel.
4) A seat as claimed in any preceding claim, in which each arm preform (30) is closed at its front end (38) .
5) A seat as claimed in any preceding claim, in which each arm preform (30) comprises a rotational moulding.
15 6) A moulded plastics arm preform (30) for fitting to a side panel (10 or 12) of a seat frame.
7) A plastics arm preform as claimed in claim 6, comprising a generally tubular portion (32) from which a hollow side portion (34) extends.
20 8) A plastics arm preform as claimed in claim 7, in which said tubular portion (32) is formed with a longitudinal slot (36) at its junction with the hollow side portion (34) , to receive a top edge (11 or 13) of the seat frame side panel.
<
 9) A plastics arm preform as claimed in claim 7 or 8, 25 having a forward end (38) which is closed.
