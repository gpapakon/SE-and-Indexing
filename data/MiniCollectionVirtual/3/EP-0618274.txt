<ABSTRACT>
The composition contains neutralized mixtures of oxidized 
asphalt and sulfonated polymer selected from sulfonated EPDM, 

sulfonated styrene-butadiene, and acrylic acid terpolymers, in an 
amount effective to allow the formation of one continuous phase or two 

interdispersed phases that do not segregate on standing at elevated 
temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to asphaltic compositions 
having viscoelastic properties that are suitable for use as binders in 
dense graded and open graded hot mix asphalt pavement. Asphalt has certain physical properties that vary widely with 
changes in temperature. For this reason, polymers often are added to 
asphalt to extend the range of its physical properties. Polymers can 
reduce the tendency of the asphalt to creep and rut in warm weather by 
increasing its high temperature viscoelastic stiffness; typical paving 
grade asphalts have softening points below 50°C, while softening 
points greater than 55°C are desired for resistance to creep in hot 
weather; and polymers can minimize cracking and stripping in cold 
weather by improving the asphalt's low temperature viscoelastic 
properties. Not all asphalts and polymers form compatible mixtures having 
storage stability. The storage stability of polymer modified asphalt 
is greatly affected by the compatibility of the asphalt with the 
particular polymer. Incompatible and partially compatible mixtures 
easily undergo phase separation.  Furthermore, some polymer modified asphalts are suitable for 
roofing applications but cannot be used in hot mix paving applications 
where the blend must be sufficiently fluid at mixing temperature to 
adequately coat the aggregate particles. For example, an asphalt 
binder for dense graded hot mix paving should have a viscosity at 
135°C between 150 and 2000 cPs, and a binder for open graded hot mix 
should have a viscosity at 135°C between 3000 and 8000 cPs. Various methods have been suggested for making polymer-modified 
asphalt compositions that are sufficiently compatible to be 
acceptably storage stable and that also have viscosities and softening 
points in the range required for a particular type of application. 
Some, for example, rely on selection of the appropriate polymer and 
other additives and require a specific sequence of blending and 
reaction steps to effect the final properties of the asphalt-polymer 
mixture (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,600,635 for use of a 
bitumen-based adhesive composition comprising bitumen, oil, and an 
ionomeric elastomer (such as sulfonated, carboxylated or phosphonated 
EPDM or butyl rubber) in less than 15% weight, preferably 3%-8%, that 
is neutralized by metal cations; British Patent No. 1,534,183 discloses 
interalia use of a metal alcoholate and the addition of from 5% to 
95% wt. of an ethylene/vinyl ester copolymer and bitumen partially 
crosslinked by
