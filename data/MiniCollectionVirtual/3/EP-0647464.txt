<ABSTRACT>
A membrane filtration module (10) is provided 
incorporating a seal assembly to seal the annular space or 

bypass channel existing between the outer diameter of the 
filtration cartridge (14) and the inner diameter of the 

housing (12) in which it is disposed. The seal assembly 
prevents a feed stream from entering the bypass channel, 

and includes a pair of seals (20) each having a flexible 
gasket (22) and a sleeve (24) extending perpendicularly 

therefrom, the sleeve being adapted to be positioned 
directly on the cartridge (14). This positioning prevents 

the feed stream from ever coming into contact with the 
housing (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of
membrane filtration and, more particularly, to an improved
device for preventing the bypass of feed flow from the
membrane filtration module.Semipermeable membranes are utilized in both high
pressure reverse osmosis and low pressure membrane
filtration such as ultrafiltration and microfiltration
processes. A typical filtration cartridge within an
membrane filtration module includes membranes wound
spirally around permeate tubes to form the cartridge. A
number of like cartridges can be combined inside of a
cylindrical housing, and are typically utilized in series
or parallel combinations for filtration of a wide variety
of food, pharmaceutical, electrodeposition paint, and
industrial waste products.In applications such as food and pharmaceutical
processing, it is essential that the filtration system be
thoroughly cleaned after processing the food or
pharmaceutical materials. Continual cleaning can also be
accomplished during processing by applying an overwrap of
plastic netting to the outer diameter of the spiral
membrane cartridge to keep the filtering membrane spaced
away from its associated housing, and utilizing
"controlled bypass" of a small amount of a feed stream
along the annular space between the inside wall of the
housing and the outer diameter of the filtering membrane
cartridge, which space is sometimes referred to as the
bypass zone or bypass channel. The flow of fluid within
this annular space continually washes away and precludes
buildup of material between the cartridge and the housing
thereby achieving the goal of thorough cleaning of the
bypass zone. The disadvantage of the controlled bypass
design is that in most cases a substantial proportion of
the feed flow will bypass the filtration membrane,
resulting in wasted pump energy and reduced operating
efficiency. This occurs because of the practical
difficulty in controlling the dimensions of the outer
diameter of the cartridge and the inner diameter of the
housing to the extent necessary to prevent a loose
cartridge fit and preferential feed flow through the
resultant gap. Alternatively, it is sometimes desirable to
eliminate the feed flow bypass, as in situations where the
fluid being processed tends to accumulate or become lodged
in the annulus between the cartridge and the housing. One
example of such a situation is the electrodeposition of
paint, whereby a paint and water feed must be filtered. It
is critical in this application that the paint does not stagnate
anywhere in the

<CLAIMS>
A device for use in filtration of a liquid feed
stream, the device comprising: a housing (12) including an

inlet (18) for receiving the feed stream at one end
thereof; a spiral filtration cartridge (14) for separating

the feed stream into concentrate and permeate, the
cartridge being disposed within the housing in spaced

relationship to the housing, the spaced relationship
presenting an essentially annular space; a pair of seals

(20) positioned on opposed ends of the cartridge, each seal
extending between the housing and cartridge for preventing

the feed stream from entering the annular space between the
cartridge and the housing, each seal comprising a gasket

(22) secured to the housing and a sleeve (24) extending
perpendicularly from the gasket and secured to the

cartridge; a first outlet (19) coupled with the housing for
accommodating withdrawal of permeate; and a second outlet

(17) coupled with the housing for discharging the
concentrate therefrom.
A device according to claim 1, wherein a first seal
(20) of the pair is positioned at an end of the filtration

cartridge (14) adjacent to the inlet (18) and wherein a
second seal (20) of the pair is positioned at an opposite

end of the filtration cartridge.
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the
sleeve (24) of each seal (20) is formed of resilient

material.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the sleeve (24) of each seal (20) has an inner

diameter slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the
cartridge (14), to allow the seals to be retained in

position on the cartridge by means of compression. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
further comprising an overwrap (36) to encapsulate the

cartridge (14) and the sleeves (24) of the associated seals
(20).
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the gasket (22) of each seal (20) is constructed of

a resilient material which can be temporarily deformed in
response to a pressure exerted thereon.
