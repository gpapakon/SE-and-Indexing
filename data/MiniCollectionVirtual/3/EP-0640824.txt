<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to structural damage detection
systems, and more particularly to structural damage detection
systems utilising optical fibres.The use of surface mounted deformation and damage
detection systems for the monitoring of structural integrity
within metallic, ceramic or composite structures is well known
within the construction and aerospace industries.The monitoring of the structural integrity of any
structure or "structural health" to which it is sometimes
referred, consists of the measurement of a number of
parameters usually including crack growth, crack direction and
point strain measurement. In the field of fibre reinforced
composites various techniques have been proposed for the
measurement of crack and strain properties. These usually
comprise of embedding the sensory device or fibre in the
lay-up of the composite thus requiring detailed and specialist
manufacturing techniques. In the field of metallic, ceramic
and civil engineering construction, crack detection is usually
conducted using "tell tales". Tell tales comprise thin
sections of either glass, conductive wire or cotton which when
fastened to the structure will break as a crack propagates
between their fastened length. Tell tales give a visual
indication of crack propagation or in the case of conductive
wire can be arranged to give an electrical indication (i.e.
breakage). Allied to the measurement of structural health
strain measurement is usually conducted using metallic strain 
gauges bonded onto the surface of a structure. A recent
advance in fibre optic technology was the use of "Bragg"
gratings which are patterns laser etched onto a single glass
fibre which perform a similar function to a conventional
strain gauge but on a far reduced physical scale.The monitoring of structural health therefore requires
the combination of a number of techniques for different
materials if it is to be conducted in situ i.e. from within or
attached to the structure, as opposed to the traditional
external non-destructive test techniques such as eddy current
sensing or dye penetrant methods.In UK Patent No. 2,145,515A (NMI Limited (UK)) a crack or
strain monitor is described which comprises two longitudinally
extending fibre-optic cables one of which is adhesively
mounted to a structure to be monitored and the other lies in
parallel to the first and above it in a super-incumbent
position. This array of fibres has light sources at one
common end of the fibres and light detectors at the other
common end. The fibre in proximity to the

A method of measuring structural defects of a structure
including the steps of:


a) Attaching to said structure at least one structural
defect sensor each comprising a plurality of longitudinally

extending fibre optic cables (2) mounted in a predetermined spaced
apart substantially parallel co-planer array (12), one side of said

array (12) being adapted for attachment to a surface (6) of a structure
to be tested,
b) coupling both ends of each of said fibre optic cables (2) to
separate ones of two light sources (18, 26) via optical

switches (16, 30) respectively,
c) monitoring variations of light parameters at both ends of
said fibre optic cables (2), and
d) determining (22) and displaying (24), from said monitored
variations, parameters describing discontinuities in the

structure.

both ends of the array (12) for connection to separate ones of
two electro-optical light sources (18, 26), switches (16, 30) and

detector circuits (20,34), the outputs of which may be
processed by a processor (22) arranged to indicate parameters

describing discontinuities on a display (24).
