A syringe adaptable to both injection and aspiration comprising a plunger (74) movable
within a barrel (10, 36), and a gasket (66) provided between said barrel and the

barrel inner wall (26, 58) disposed between two sections (16, 20) extending in the
direction of said barrel inner wall (26, 58) of said plunger or an all-round receptacle

(76) within the plunger and having a maximum thickness, seen in the longitudinal
direction of said plunger, that is less than or equal to the inside distance (A) between

said sections of said plunger or the limiting walls (80, 82, 84, 86) of said receptacle
in the area of said gasket, respectively, and having a maximum outer diameter that is

at least equal to the inner diameter of said barrel, said gasket (66) comprising an
outer, bead-like section (46) adjacent said sections of said plunger or said limiting

walls of said receptacle and said barrel inner wall, an inner, bead like section (72)
surrounding said plunger (74) sealingly, as well as a membrane-like or skin-like

central section (70), via which said outer and said inner section merge into one
another and are connected to one another, wherein a substantially linear sealing effect

is obtained between said outer section (68) of said gasket and said barrel inner wall,
characterized in that

said gasket (66) is freely movable with play between said sections of said plunger

(74) or said receptacle (76) provided therein when the syringe is at rest, said inner
and said outer section (72, 68) of said gasket (66) each form a semicylindrical section

(70) and between the said section (72) of said gasket and said plunger (74) also a
substantially linear sealing effect is obtained. 
A syringe according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

said receptacle (52, 76) for said gasket (44) is an all-round depression of V-shaped
section in said plunger (38, 74).
A syringe according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

said receptacle (78) for said gasket (76) comprises in section two rectangular or
square inner sections and trapezoidal outer sections symmetrical in respect to the

longitudinal axis of said plunger
A syringe according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

said bead-like outer section (46, 68) of said gasket (44, 66) has a radial extent (W,
R
1
) that is approximately twice as large as the radial extent (M, R
3
) of said inner
section (48, 72).
A syringe according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

when said gasket (66) is double-dumbbell-shaped in section said skin-like or membrane-like
central section between said bead-like outer or inner sections (68, 72) has

a radial extent R
2
 that is approximately equal to that of said outer section (68) and
approximately twice as great as that of said inner section (72).
A syringe according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

said gasket (24, 44) is in sealing contact between said barrel inner wall (26, 58) and
said section (20) distant from the end face of said plunger or the distant limiting wall

(62, 80, 86) when said syringe is used for injection, and in sealing contact between
said barrel inner wall and said section (26) proximal to the end face of said plunger

or the proximal limiting wall (60, 82, 84) when said syringe is used for sucking. 
A syringe according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

when said plunger (84) is moved said outer section (68) and said inner section (72)
exercise an approximately rolling movement in relation to the barrel inner wall and

to the bottom of said receptacle, respectively.
