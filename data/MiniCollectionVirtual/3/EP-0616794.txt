<ABSTRACT>
A catheter adapted to perform electrophysiological procedures 
comprises 

a body member (11), a manipulation handle (20) attached to the proximal 
end of the body 

member for applying torque to the body member, the handle having a 
control 

knob (43) adapted for control movements in a first plane (62) and 
in a second plane (66) 

simultaneously. A deflection control line is attached at its distal end 
to the distal 

portion of the catheter and its proximal end attached to the control 
device of the 

handle so that tension applied to the control line by sliding the 
control knob causes 

deflection of the distal portion of the catheter. A stiffening member 
(31) is disposed 

within the body member of the catheter and is slidable, said stiffening 
member 

providing increased rigidity to the portion of the body member in which 
the 

stiffening member is located. Rotation of the control knob controls the 
position 

of the stiffening member in the body member. In a further aspect, a 
stiffening 

member in accordance with one embodiment includes a tapered distal end 
section 

with a ball formed on the distal tip, the tapered section terminating 
at the ball. 

In accordance with another aspect, the torsional rigidity of the 
catheter body is 

increased by use of a layer of aramid fibers mixed with an epoxy. In 
yet another 

feature, the handle and rotatable sliding element are symmetrically 
shaped to 

facilitate complete single-handed operation of the handle by the 
physician of all position control aspects of the catheter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to catheters, and more particularly, to 
steerable catheters for performing electrophysiological procedures, such as 
mapping electrical signals emitted from conductive cardiac tissue and ablating 
aberrant cardiac tissue at the point of arrhythmia origination in order to terminate 
the arrhythmia. The heart beat in a healthy human is controlled by the sinoatrial node (S-A 
node) located in the wall of the right atrium. The S-A node generates action 
potentials which are transmitted through pathways of conductive heart tissue in the 
atrium to the atrioventricular node (A-V node) which in turn transmits the signals 
throughout the ventricle by means of the His and Purkinje conductive tissues. 
Improper growth of or damage to the conductive tissue in the heart can interfere 
with the passage of electrical signals from the S-A and A-V nodes resulting in 
disturbances to the normal rhythm of the heart, referred to as cardiac arrhythmia. If the arrhythmia is refractory to medication, an alternative treatment is to 
ablate the aberrant conductive tissue. However, that aberrant tissue must first be 
located. One technique involves the electrical mapping of signals emanating from 
conductive cardiac tissue to locate the aberrant tissue causing the arrhythmia. 
Ablation may then be performed. Ablation of the aberrant conductive tissue 
usually controls the arrhythmia and allows the heart rhythm to return to an 
acceptable level.  One conventional method for mapping the electrical signals from 
conductive heart tissue is to provide an array of electrodes on the distal extremity 
of a catheter and place those electrodes in contact with the interior of a patient's 
heart. Typically, the catheter is introduced into the cardiovascular system of the 
patient through a blood vessel and advanced to an endocardial site such as the 
atrium or ventricle of the heart. When placed into the blood vessel, the catheter 
must follow the irregularly shaped path defined by the blood vessel and branch 
vessels until the distal end of the catheter reaches the desired location. To assist 
in steering the catheter, some catheters have a curved distal tip. While this preformed 
curve may fit the curves of some blood vessels, it rarely fits all anatomical 
possibilities. Greater freedom of movement is desirable. To achieve greater control over the movement of the catheter in steering 
it through the cardiovascular system to the desired location in the patient, prior 
catheters have used guide wires to

A catheter for performing an electrophysiological procedure, the 
catheter comprising: 

   a body member having a distal end and a proximal end; 
   a manipulation handle attached to the proximal end of the body member 

such that when the handle is rotated about its longitudinal axis, the body member 
rotates about its longitudinal axis in response, the handle having a selectively 

moveable control device adapted for movement in a first plane and in a second 
plane simultaneously; and 

   a stiffening member disposed within the body member and slidable in a 
direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body member, said stiffening 

member providing increased rigidity to the portion of the body member in which 
the stiffening member is located, the stiffening member connected at its proximal 

end to the control device of the handle such that movement of the control device 
in the second plane controls the position of the stiffening member in the body 

member. 
The catheter of claim 1 further having a deflection control line slidable 
in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body member, the control line 

having a distal end fixedly attached to the distal portion of the catheter and the 
proximal end attached to the control device of the handle so that tension applied 

to the control line by movement of the control device in the first plane will cause 
the deflection of the distal portion of the catheter. 
The catheter of any of the preceding claims wherein the handle 
comprises a handle body and the control device comprises a rotatable slide 

 
element mounted on the handle body for rotational and sliding movement in 

relation thereto, wherein the rotatable slide element is coupled to both the 
stiffening member and the control line, and wherein the selective movement of the 

rotatable slide element controls both the tension on the control line and the 
position of the stiffening member such that sliding the rotatable slide element in 

a first direction applies tension to the control line and sliding the rotatable slide 
element in a second direction releases tension from the control line, while rotating 

the rotatable slide element in a first direction advances the stiffening element 
towards the distal end of the body member and rotating the rotatable slide element 

in a second direction retracts the stiffening element towards the proximal end of 
the body member. 
The catheter of claim 3 wherein the handle and rotatable sliding element

including rotation of the handle, rotation of the rotatable sliding element, and 
sliding of the rotatable sliding element. 
The catheter of claim 3 or 4 wherein the rotatable sliding element has 
a grooved surface, the groove disposed about the periphery of the element, for 

receiving the digit of an operator and adapted to receive the contact of the 
operator's digit on either side of the groove to slide the element. 
The catheter of claim 3, 4 or 5 wherein the range of movement of the 
rotatable sliding element and the coupling of the control line and the stiffening 

member thereto are selected so as to: 
   result in a complete release of tension on the control line when the rotatable 

sliding element is at one end of the range of sliding movement;
 

   result in positioning of the stiffening member at a position when the 
rotatable sliding member is rotated to one end of its range of rotation resulting in 

a first radius of curvature of the distal end of the body member when tension is 
applied to the control line; and 

   result in positioning of the stiffening member at a position when the 
rotatable sliding member is rotated to the other end of its range of rotation 

resulting in a second radius of curvature of the distal end of the body member 
different from the first radius when tension is applied to the control line.

member and its connection to the handle are such that when the control device is 

moved to the fully retracted position for the stiffening element, the distal end of 
the catheter will have a first radius of deflection when tension is applied to the 

control line; when the control device is moved to an intermediate position for the 
stiffening element, the distal end of the catheter will have a second radius of 

deflection for part of the distal end and a third, different radius of deflection for 
a second portion of the distal end when tension is applied to the control line, and 

   when the control device is moved to the fully extended position for the 
stiffening element, the distal end of the catheter will have a fourth radius of 

deflection when tension is applied to the control line.
