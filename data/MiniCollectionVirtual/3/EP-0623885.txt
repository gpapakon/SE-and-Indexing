<ABSTRACT>
A device to acquire classification information (38) on the basis of defects (23) or other patterns (12), particularly for sorting profiled boards, has, for inexpensively produced real time operation with high throughput, data reduction, which is based first on selection in each case of a group of adjacent pixels (p) in the sight line (16). The intensity values (i[p]) which are assigned to the selected pixels undergo bit width reduction by a weighting template (30) for unblurred edge detection in the direction of the sight line (16), and in the transport direction (10) which is orthogonal to it, while all intensity contributions of adjacently detected pixels (p) become zero, where a marked intensity jump does not indicate a leading or trailing pattern edge, with subsequent linkage of the resulting edge information with two-level grey value intensity information into pattern information (34), for the representatives of each pixel group of the sight line (16). Horizontally, orthogonally and diagonally adjacent agreeing information in the pattern information (34) of each sequence of two sight lines (16) is individualised by assignment of object numbers (37), and represents, as the result of the fast hardware pre-processing, the classification information (38) for a computer program for pattern classification and for output of sorting class information (40).

Device for deriving items of classification information
(38) from items of video gray-scale-value information (17)

of samples (12) scanned along lines of sight (16) displaced
so as to be parallel in relation to one another,

particularly for grading profiled boards according to the
type and distribution of defects (23) which can be opto-electronically

detected on their surfaces,

characterized in that

first of all, by means of hardware, each time from a
sequence of pixels (p), which are adjacent to one another

in the line of sight (16), only that pixel (p), which in
this sequence has an item of gray-scale-value information

(17) of extreme amplitude, is connected both to a colour-intensity
filter (25) and to an edge filter (26), in

which the remaining intensity values (i[p]) of one line

of sight (16) are converted into a two-bit item of
intensity information and the intensity values (i[p]
)
of successive lines of sight (16) are also converted by

means of weighting masks (30.1, 30.2) to four-bit items
of edge information as regards a sample limitation in

direction of the line of sight (16) and orthogonally to
it, with subsequent linkage and reduction in a table

selection circuit (32) to four-bit items of sample
information (34) according to intensity and edge

gradients for each of the remaining pixels (p); after
which these items of sample information (34) are

separated from one another as regards pixels (p) which
are horizontally adjacent to one another in the manner

of pixels in the actual line (16) and also pixels (p)
which are orthogonally and diagonally adjacent to one

another in the manner of pixels in successive lines of
sight (16) with corresponding information content by

allocating object numbers (37) so as then to be
evaluated as a sequence of individual geometric items

of classification information (38) by a classification
programme for determining and evaluating shape, for

example with regard to defects (23). 
Device according to Claim 1,

characterized in that,

before the group reduction, an accentuation of the
intensity values (i) of pixels (p) of weak intensity in

the item of gray-scale-value information (17) is provided.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that,

before the group reduction, a storage of the items of
gray-scale-value information (17) is provided for

presentation on a display unit (21).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that

the surfaces of wooden boards, in which defects (23)
should lead to items of classification information

(38) are illuminated from a red-light source (22) to
suppress the graining influences on the intensity values

(i[p]).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that

the weighting masks (30) for detecting a sample edge
each detect three pixels (p) lying side by side and

always rate their intensity values (i[p]) in the

middle pixel with the factor "-1", on the other hand
the pixel (p), which could be allocated a sample edge

located in or counter to the mask's direction of
displacement, is rated with the factor "+1" and the

remaining pixel (p) with the factor "0".
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that

in the edge filter (25) for determining the edge and in
the length coder (33) for the proximity search, in each

case intermediate stores (31) are provided at right
angles to the line of sight (16) for the corresponding

pixel intensities (i[p]) of the previously registered

line of sight (16). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that

in the colour intensity filter (25), two intensity
thresholds (27) with clearly different gray-scale-value

thresholds work in parallel.
Device according to Claim 7,

characterized in that,

after the colour-intensity and edge filtering, the
intensity values (i[p]
) are read out from the table
selection circuit (32) for an item of sample information

(34) of reduced bit width, which registers the two
intensities and a statement as to whether or not there

is an edge for the respective intensity.
