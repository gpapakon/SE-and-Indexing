<ABSTRACT>
Sprayable concrete is produced by carrying out the known dry spraying process and here using, besides known aggregates and water, as cement a cement having a defined sulphate content and adding to the make-up water a non-demixing, low-viscosity liquid of amorphous silicon dioxide in colloidal particle size and here omitting the addition of setting accelerators.

<CLAIMS>
Sprayed concrete, processable by a known dry spraying 
process, wherein in addition to known additives and 

water the cement used is a cement having a calcium 
sulphate content of from 0.04 to 2 wt.%, calculated as 

SO
3
 and/or an alkali sulphate content, calculated as 
SO
3
, in the range of from 0.3 to 2.6 wt.% for potassium 
sulphate and in the range of from 0.05 to 2.8 wt.% for 

sodium sulphate, and a low-viscosity liquid, which 
does not demix, of amorphous silicon dioxide of 

colloidal particle size, is added to the mixing water 
and the addition of setting accelerators is dispensed 

with. 
Process for the production of sprayed concrete 
according to claim 1, characterised in that a known 

dry spraying process is carried out and in the course 
of this in addition to known additives and water the 

cement used is a cement having a calcium sulphate 
content of from 0.04 to 2 wt.%, calculated as SO
3
 
and/or an alkali sulphate content, calculated as SO
3
, 
in the range of from 0.3 to 2.6 wt.% for potassium 

sulphate and in the range of from 0.05 to 2.8 wt.% for 
sodium sulphate, and wherein a low-viscosity liquid, 

which does not demix, of amorphous silicon dioxide of 
colloidal particle size, is added to the mixing water 

and the addition of setting accelerators is dispensed 
with.
