Adjustable device coupling the drive (5) and the stirring 
shaft rod (3), for each of the stirring devices on paint stirring 

machines, characterised by the fact that it causes operation of a drive 
(5) of which the part coupling with the stirring shaft rod (3) is in 

the form of a sleeve (7) which receives the said stirring shaft rod in 
its bore with low play, the said sleeve having at least one lengthwise 

port (9) formed on its wall and external side notches (11) spaced 
lengthwise, the stirrer rod (3) received in the sleeve (7) which has at 

its upper end at least one transversal drilled hole (15) and an element 
in clip form (17) having two flexible claws (21) connected to a base 

part (19) and orientated towards each other so as to flexibly embrace 
said drive sleeve, each of the said claws also having an internal rise 

(23) complementary respectively to each of the said notches (11), the 
base part (19) being provided with a pin or shaft element (25) 

extending towards the opening in the clip element and engaging in the 
said drilled hole in the stirrer shaft, the said clip element being 

made to engage on the sleeve on the port side (9) by a simple manual 
push so as to lock the connection between drive and shaft rod, the said 

pin element (25) engaging in the port and the hole on the stirrer rod, 
while the claws of the clip simultaneously grip the sleeve casing at an 

appropriate height for coupling, their internal rises engaging in the 
sleeve notches, and for disengagement by reverse traction to free the 

coupling connection. 
Coupling device according to Claim 1, characterised by the 
fact that the drive (5) has several sets of notches (11) opposite each 

other two by two on the sleeve casing. 
Coupling device according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised by the fact that the clip element (17) is symmetrical in 

relation to a median plan of the base part (19).  
 
Coupling device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by the fact that the said notches opposite each other 

(11) are arranged parallel to the median plan (P) of the drive, in a 
zone of grip by the clip claws on the drive casing. 
Coupling device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by the fact that the notches (11) are variable in 

conformation. 
Coupling device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by having several ports (9) for insertion of the clip 

shaft pin (25), the said ports being linked by systems of notches (11) 
staggered in height. 
Coupling device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by the fact that the stirrer rod (3) in its upper part 

has a number of drill holes (15) staggered in height.
