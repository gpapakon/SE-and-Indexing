<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of stabilizing the 
gain of spectroscopy equipment using the actual measured spectrum 

of the formation of interest and thereby eliminating the need to 
use external radioactive calibration sources. The gain is 

measured and adjusted using spectral fitting techniques. In 
these techniques, an energy spectrum of the radiation from an 

earth formation is measured. The measured spectrum is compared 
to a standard spectrum or composite spectrum. As a result of the 

comparisons, deviations between corresponding features of the two 
spectra are determined. Gain correction signals are calculated 

based on the determined deviations. The gain of the spectroscopy 
equipment is adjusted based on these calculated correction 

signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of regulating gain for
downhole spectroscopy tools without using a calibration source.
In particular, it relates to a method of adjusting the gain of
this equipment using features from the measured energy spectrum
of an earth formation.The major objective of well logging is to obtain quantitative
and qualitative information related to hydrocarbons in earth
formations surrounding a well. In many nuclear well logging
techniques the formation and borehole are irradiated by energetic
nuclear particles such as neutrons and gamma rays. These
particles may either be scattered in the formation or the
borehole or they may undergo a nuclear reaction which results in
the creation of a new particle or gamma ray. The scattered
particles or newly created particles can be detected at one or
several locations and by one or more detectors. The number of
energy particles detected and their energy levels generate 
signals that contain information about the irradiated earth
formation and the borehole. During the logging process, various
processing techniques can be applied to these signals in order to
get the desired logging information from the signal. One of
these processing techniques is comparing features of these
signals with other known data to make certain determinations
about the information contained in the signals.Many of the nuclear well logging techniques compare the
measured signal with additional information. Many of the
techniques compare the measured signals with other data based on
spectral analysis of the measured signal. As stated earlier,
these signals are sometimes gamma rays that result from
interactions of atoms with neutrons emitted from a downhole
radiation source. Such gamma ray signals are representative of
certain atoms of the lithology of the formation (i.e. the matrix
or the formation fluid) or of the borehole. In one example of
spectral analysis, the energy spectrum of gamma rays resulting
from the capture of the neutrons is decomposed into contributions
due to individual formation elements, usually called "elemental
yields". These elemental yields reveal information concerning
the presence of earth formation elements such as hydrogen,
silicon, calcium, chlorine, sulfur and iron. Important
petrophysical parameters such as porosity, matrix lithology and
water salinity may be derived from the elemental yields. An 
example of a capture gamma ray spectra analysis is depicted in U.

<CLAIMS>
A method of regulating the gain of a nuclear well logging
apparatus positioned in a wellbore traversing an earth formation,

the method comprising the steps of:

detecting energetic particles from the wellbore and formation
and measuring the energies of the detected particles in order to

generate a measured energy spectrum of said particles;
comparing at least two parts of the measured energy spectrum
with the corresponding parts of a composite standard spectrum;
determining from said comparison a gain factor which if
applied to the measured spectrum results in the best fit between

the measured spectrum and the composite standard spectrum;
using said gain factor to adjust the gain of the apparatus
during a subsequent detection step; and
repeating the preceding sequence of steps from time to time to
reduce the effect of apparatus gain variations on the spectrum

measurements.
The method of claim 1, further including setting an initial
gain, determining whether the quality of said fit is within a

desired tolerance for fit quality, and if it is not, adjusting the
gain in steps, repeating the spectrum comparing step for each gain,

until a best fit is found within the desired tolerance.
The method of claim 2, further comprising the step of
producing an error message if a fit quality within the desired

tolerance is not found within a specific number of attempts.
The method of claim 1, wherein an initial gain is determined
by using a grid search that is performed to obtain the range of

gains for which a quality fit can be found, comprising the steps
of: 


setting an initial gain estimate which is much higher or lower
than an anticipated gain value;
fitting the measured spectrum to a set of standard spectra;
determining the quality of fit;
adjusting the gain of the measured spectrum by a predetermined
amount;
saving this gain value and the corresponding quality of fit
value;
repeating the steps of setting, fitting, determining, adjusting
and saving for a predetermined number of times until the gain

estimate is significantly lower or higher than the anticipated gain
value;
determining from the saved gain values the gain for which the
quality of fit is best;
using that value as an initial gain.
The method of claim 2, wherein an initial gain is estimated by
dividing the spectrum in two or more strategically located windows

and using a function of counts in the two or more windows to obtain
the estimate of the gain.
The method of claim 5 where said function of the counts is the
ratio between the counts in the two or more windows.
The method of claim 5 where two windows are used and the
function of the counts is the ratio between the counts in the two

windows.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the fit quality data
used for gain regulation are obtained from the fitting procedure 

being simultaneously performed to determine the relative earth
element formation contributions in the measured energy spectrum.
