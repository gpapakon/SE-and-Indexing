<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light input reflector 
for optical-fiber systems. The reflector is calculable 
with an algorithm and distinguishes itself from conventional 
reflectors by its many times higher efficiency. Light input reflectors are known from traffic signal 
technology and medical technology for coupling light into 
optical-fiber systems, for example glass fibers. Up to now 
efficiencies of 1 to about 7% have been obtained, based on a 
1.5 m glass-fiber bundle with an optical diameter of 14 mm 
(efficiency is defined by the DIN standard as the coefficient 
of utilization, the ratio of the luminous flux radiated 
by the illuminating system to the luminous flux emitted 
by the illuminant). The efficiencies hitherto reached in light input reflectors 
for optical-fiber systems are very low. In addition, 
the luminous intensity distribution on the light entrance 
surface of the optical-fiber system is extremely uneven 
in known reflectors, which entails various serious 
disadvantages. The invention is therefore based on the problem of 
providing an improved light input reflector for optical-fiber 
systems, in particular one characterized by higher efficiency 
and permitting uniform light distribution based on 
the light entrance surface of the optical-fiber system. The invention is based on the finding that this problem 
can be solved by calculating the reflector curve according 
to a certain algorithm that does not correspond to the algorithm 
for an ellipse or parabola. The object of the invention is a light input reflector 
for optical-fiber systems characterized in that at least 50% 
of the deviated luminous flux of the lamp hits the light 
entrance surface of the optical-fiber system.  Conventional reflectors did not permit such high illumination 
of the light entrance surface. At least 80%, in 
particular at least 85%, of the deviated luminous flux of 
the lamp is preferably guided onto the light entrance surface. The inventive light input reflector permits the efficiency 
according to the above definition to be increased to 
about 30%. The light input reflector is also characterized in that 
the luminous intensity is very constant over the light entrance 
surface of the optical-fiber system, in particular 
varying no more than 10%, preferably no more than 5%. This makes it possible to avoid the hitherto customary 
disadvantages in the luminous intensity distribution at the 
input point, as given e.g. in ellipsoid reflectors, which 
theoretically offer the best focusing but cause
