<ABSTRACT>
The air distributor has an air outlet chamber (2) which tapers conically from an inflow duct (3), so that the air flowing off into the surrounding room (9) through numerous air outflow orifices (7, 8) is directed correspondingly obliquely. The air outlet chamber (2) has different outflow regions (13, 14) following one another in its circumferential direction, the outflow regions differing by the size of the numerous air outflow orifices (7, 8) arranged in them. In respectively adjacent regions (13), a higher energy flow thus flows off, with an inductive effect on the other outflow regions (14).
