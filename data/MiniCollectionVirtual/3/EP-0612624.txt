<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet printer which includes a printhead pen (20) 
using more than one color of ink and having a nozzle 

plate (22) for ejecting ink from the printhead onto a 
print medium, the nozzle plate including a plurality of 

nozzles (24) arranged in a column with the nozzles which 
are to supply like colors separated into a plurality of 

groups of nozzles (32,34,36,38) such that the nozzles for 
different color inks are physically separated by a 

greater distance than are nozzles for the same color ink.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computer 
hardcopy printers and more particularly to ink-jet printers. 
The predominant current usage of the improved thermal 
ink-jet printer assembly of the present invention is as a 
means of obtaining high definition color printouts of computer 
generated text and graphics. With the advent of computers came the need for devices 
which could produce the results of computer generated work 
product in a printed form. Early devices used for this 
purpose were simple modifications of the then current electric 
typewriter technology. But these devices could not 
produce picture graphics, nor could they produce multicolored 
images, nor could they print as rapidly as was desired. Numerous advances have been made in the field. Notable 
among these has been the development of the impact dot 
matrix printer. While that type of printer is still widely 
used, it is neither as fast nor as durable as is required 
in many applications. Nor can it easily produce high definition 
color printouts. The development of the thermal 
ink-jet printer has solved many of these problems. U. S. 
Pat. No. 4,728,963 issued to S. O. Rasmussen et al., and  
 
assigned to the same assignee as is this application, 
teaches an example of this type of printer technology. Thermal ink-jet printers operate by employing a plurality 
of resistor elements to expel droplets of ink 
through an associated plurality of nozzles. In particular, 
each resistor element, which is typically a pad of resistive 
material about 50µm by 50µm in size, is located in a 
chamber filled with ink supplied from an ink reservoir. A 
nozzle plate, comprising a plurality of nozzles, or openings, 
with each nozzle associated with a resistor element, 
defines a part of the chamber. Upon the energizing of a 
particular resistor element, a droplet of ink is expelled 
by droplet vaporization through the nozzle toward the print 
medium, whether paper, fabric, or the like. The firing of 
ink droplets is typically under the control of a microprocessor, 
the signals of which are conveyed by electrical 
traces to the resistor elements. The pen containing the nozzles is moved repeatedly 
across the width of the medium to be printed upon. At each 
of a designated number of increments of this movement 
across the medium, each of the nozzles is caused either to 
eject ink or to refrain from ejecting ink according to the 
program output of the controlling microprocessor. Each 
completed movement across the medium can print a swath 
appro

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printer for depositing ink upon a print 
medium, including: 


a printhead pen using more than one color of ink, 
said printhead being movably affixed to said printer such 

that it can be moved under computer control across a print 
medium, dispensing ink as required upon said medium, said 

printhead having a nozzle plate adapted for ejecting ink 
from said printhead onto said print medium, said nozzle 

plate including a plurality of nozzles arranged in a column 
with the nozzles which are to supply like colors being arranged  

 
into a plurality of groups of nozzles, each group being separated by 

inter-group spacings such that the nozzles 
for different color inks are physically separated by a 

greater distance than are nozzles for the same color ink, 
said inter-group spacings being an integer multiple of an index distance between adjacent 

nozzle centres for the same colour nozzles in one of said groups, and said inter-group 
spacings being less than a swath width established by one of said nozzle groups. 
The ink-jet printer of Claim 1 , wherein the column 
into which the nozzles is arranged is a staggered column 

with alternate of the nozzles aligned and consecutive 

nozzles non-aligned. 
The ink-jet printer of Claim 1 , and further including: 

means for advancing said print medium past said 
printhead after each swath of said printhead, said means 

adapted to advance said medium by a medium advance span 
which is the length of a portion of the column of nozzles 

which includes all of the nozzles associated with one color, 
and wherein data sent to the columns of nozzles associated 

with successive color bands is delayed relative to the 
data that is fed to the immediately preceding column of 

nozzles by a number of index lines equal to the number of  
 

nozzles in a column associated with one color ink plus a 
number of index lines equivalent to the space between columns 

of nozzles associated with different colors. 
The ink-jet printer of Claim 1 , and further including: 

a platen heater positioned adjacent to said print 
medium and opposing said printhead such that said print medium 

is drawn between said platen heater and said printhead. 
The ink-jet printer of Claim 4 , and further including: 

(a) a vacuum-creating means for producing a partial 
vacuum behind said platen heater, said vacuum-creating 

means being affixed to said ink-jet printer such that a 
partial vacuum is formed in a cavity behind said platen 

heater on a side of said platen heater opposite said print 
medium; and 
(b) a plurality of holes in said platen heater 
positioned to expose said print medium to the partial vacuum 

such that said print medium is held against said platen 
heater for efficient transfer of heat from said platen 

heater to said print medium. 
The ink-jet printer of Claim 5 , and further including: 

means to mechanically press said print medium 
against said platen heater to maximize the conduction of 

heat from said platen heater to said print medium. 
The ink-jet printer of Claim 4 , wherein: 

said platen heater further is extended into a 
preheating area, said preheating area being the area over 

which said print medium passes just prior to its being  
 

printed upon, such that said print medium is already heated 
prior to application of ink thereto. 
The ink-jet printer of Claim 4 , wherein: 

said platen heater further is extended into a 
post-heating area, said post-heating area being the area 

over which said print medium passes just after it is printed 
upon, such that said print medium continues to be heated 

by said platen heater even after it is printed upon. 
An ink-jet pen for use in an ink-jet printer for 
depositing ink upon a print medium, including: 


a printhead pen using more than one color of ink, 
said printhead being movably affixed to said printer such

print medium, dispensing ink as required upon said medium, 

said printhead having a nozzle plate adapted for ejecting
