<ABSTRACT>
The caseinate replacement composition for 
imitation cheese is made of a granular 

hydroxypropylated, high amylose starch having a degree 
of substitution of greater than 0.04, gelatin and a gum 

such as pectin and carrageenan. The gum is used to 
decrease the amount of gelatin necessary and to improve 

the texture of the overall cheese analog. The 
caseinate replacement composition replaces all or a 

portion of the caseinate in the imitation cheese.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to imitation cheese and, 
more specifically, to a caseinate replacement 
composition for use in imitation cheese. Imitation cheese is a product in which vegetable 
fats and/or oils are used to replace milk fats normally 
present in cheese. Typically, imitation cheeses are 
made from water, caseinate, vegetable fat/oil and 
flavoring. A starch such as thin-boiled starch may 
also be present in a typical imitation cheese 
formulation. The caseinate is usually sodium, 
potassium, or calcium caseinate as well as the salts 
generated by treating casein and rennet casein with a 
base. Caseinate provides not only protein to the 
cheese but also provides the cheese with certain 
physical attributes. Casein and caseinates, which are obtained from 
milk, often fluctuate in price and availability. 
Pregelatinized, converted and/or derivatized starches 
have been suggested as alternatives to caseinate, e.g. 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,499,116; 4,608,265; and 4,695,475. It has now been discovered that caseinate can be 
replaced with a composition comprising a granular, 
hydroxypropylated high amylose starch and a gel 
component. This composition can be used to replace all 
or a portion of the caseinate used in imitation cheese. The gel component is preferably a combination of 
gelatin and a gum such as xanthan gum or pectin. Gums 
are generally obtained from natural sources and often 
fluctuate in availability and cost. Typically, gums 
are too expensive to use alone and it has been found 
that by using a gelatin in combination with the gum, 
the cost of the caseinate replacement of the present 
invention is reduced. However, a gum alone or a 
gelatin alone can be used as the gel component in the 
formulation of the caseinate replacement of the present  
 
invention. The caseinate replacement composition of the 
present invention provides for a more efficient use 
of starch than conventional caseinate replacement 
compositions that employ pregelatinized starch. The 
granular starch of the present invention provides more 
efficient use of starch than the prior art 
pregelatinized starches because the granular starch of 
the present invention provides better thickening 
capability than the pregelatinized starches. 
Additionally, by eliminating the pregelatinization 
step, the cost of manufacture of the starch component 
of the present invention is less than conventional 
pregelatinized caseinate replacement starches. If a thin-boiled starch is present in the 
conventional imitation cheese formulation,
