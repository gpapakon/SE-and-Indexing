<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic 
system for computing the fuel injection time of an 
internal combustion engine. Electronic systems for computing injection time 
are known wherein an electronic microprocessor system is 
supplied with a number of signals relative to parameters 
typical of an internal combustion engine (e.g. air 
intake and/or pressure, position of the throttle valve 
in the air intake manifold, air intake temperature, 
engine cooling water temperature, battery voltage, 
etc..), and processes the signals to generate an output 
signal controlling the fuel injection system. Known computing systems take some time (normally 
in the order of a few tens of milliseconds) to process 
all the incoming information signals, so that, during 
transient operating states of the engine (e.g. sharp 
acceleration), they fail to respond promptly to rapid 
variations in the input signals, thus resulting in an 
inadequate output control signal. Processing of the information signals may be  
 
accelerated using faster microprocessors, but only at 
the expense of increasing the total cost of the 
computing system. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a low-cost electronic computing system designed 
to enable high-speed processing. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an electronic system computing the fuel injection 
time of an internal combustion engine, and applying in use 
the computed fuel injection time supplied to an output of 
the electronic system to a fuel injection control 
apparatus, comprising first computing means supplied with 
a number of information signals (X1,...XN,Qt) measured in 
said engine; said first computing means generating at the 
output a fuel injection time (T) computed on the basis of 
a characteristic (T=F(X1,...XN,Qt)) depending on said 
information signals at a first rate; characterized by the 
fact that it also comprises: means for processing an 
expansion of said characteristic (T=F(X1,...XN,Qt)), which 
expansion is computed, as a function of a previously 
computed injection time (T) and of a first value (Qt) of 
at least one significant information signal used for 
computing said injection time, about said first value (Qt) 
of said significant signal; second computing means 
supplied with said expansion of said characteristic 
(T=F(X1,...XN,Qt)) and with a second value (Qt+1) of said 
significant signal; said second computing means generating 
at the output an approximate injection time (Tn) computed
