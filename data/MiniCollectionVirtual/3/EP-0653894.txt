<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to public mobile phone 
systems for mass-transit application which utilize time 

division multiplexing and time slot interchanging 
techniques useful for allowing individual passengers to 

make calls during commuting, and charging the individual 
for their telephone call(s) made, only. Such mass-transit 

applications include, but are not limited to buses, 
trains, metrorails, sea coastal vessels and streetcars.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a public mobile 
phone system and more particularly to a public mobile phone 
system for mass transit applications, including, but not 
limited to buses, trains, metrorails, streetcars and sea 
coastal vessels, for allowing individual passengers to make 
calls while commuting. Cellular telephony, to date, has addressed the need of 
communicating with the rest of the world when the subscriber 
is in a vehicle and in traffic or when in an area where 
stationary telephones are not easily accessible and the area 
is serviced by cellular telephony. The mobile telephone, 
however, is a "personal" phone; i.e. the subscriber "owns" 
it, must carry it with him/her, and must pay subscription on 
a monthly basis, in addition to all telephone charges for 
calls made with his/hers mobile telephone. However, for a 
variety of reasons, not everyone can have a mobile 
telephone. Herein, the terms cellular telephone or mobile 
telephone refer to the same apparatus. Consequently, to date, cellular telephony has not 
addressed another need: communication from a public 
transportation vehicle whereby a passenger can call during 
commuting, without "owing" the cellular phone and be charged 
for the telephone call made, only. United States Patent no. 5,134,651 issued to Ortiz et 
al is directed to an autonomous pay telephone which allows 
a user to access information regarding the amount owed for 
individual calls such that an owner of such telephone can 
charge the user an appropriate fee. Such system, however,  
 
does not pertain to mass-transit vehicles where the 
telephone is not owned and the user is allowed to pay for 
such call using a personal credit card or calling card as in 
the present invention. United States Patent No. 5,109,401 issued to Hattori et 
al is directed to a radio telecommunication apparatus which 
calculates and stores a charge rate, however, does not 
pertain to a system whereby the apparatus is to be used by 
a plurality of user's who will be charged separate fees as 
in the present invention. Therefore, none of the prior art teaches a pay-by-call 
mobile telephone system for mass-transit vehicles whereby 
the cellular telephone is not owned. The present invention pertains to a public mobile 
telephone system whereby a multiplicity of telephones is 
multiplexed and placed in a public transportation vehicle. 
This system is connected with a stationary cellular 
telephone system over a wireless link, and provides a pay-by-call 
service to passengers without

<CLAIMS>
A mobile telephone system for mass-transit applications comprising: 

(a) a plurality of mobile telephones having a plurality of handsets and a 
plurality of corresponding cradles, said plurality of mobile telephones 

having a plurality of respective ON/OFF switches therein, activation of 
said OFF switch producing a first signal indicating a handset is off a 

cradle and activation of said ON switch producing a second signal 
indicating said handset is on said cradle; and, 
(b) controller means for receiving and responding to said first and 
second signals, said controller means including means for processing 

said signals via cellular radio telecommunication channels to allow a 
plurality of users to make calls, and including means for calculating said 

plurality of users' charges based on at least one predetermined 
parameter. 
The system of claim 1, further comprising a plurality of ports which 
communicate with said controller means by producing ON/OFF signals for allowing 

said plurality of users to hook-up personal computers for data transmission. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said controller means includes a 
micro-processor. 
The system of claim 3, wherein said controller means further 
comprises circuitry channels and radios. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said plurality of telephones comprises 
display means for displaying instructions to said users. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said plurality of telephones further 
comprises audio means for instructing said users in operating said telephones. 
A mobile telephone system for mass-transit applications comprising: 

(a) a plurality of user telephones having respective ON/OFF switches; 
(b) a plurality of radio channels; 
(c) means for processing said switches of said plurality of telephones, 
said means for processing providing available radio channels to a 

respective number of user telephones; 
(d) means for sequencing said switches of said plurality of telephones 
such that a first of said plurality of telephones is assigned a first available 

radio channel and an x number of said plurality of telephones is assigned 
a y number of said plurality of radio channels, where x is and integer of 

at least two and y is an integer less than or equal to x; 
(e) means for displaying instructions to users for placing a call when 
said available radio channel is attained; 
(f) means for calculating said users' charges based on at least one 
predetermined parameter. 
The device of claim 7, wherein the means for processing said switches 
of said plurality of telephones is a micro-processor. 
The device of claim 7, wherein the means for sequencing is a time slot 
interchange circuit. 
The system of claim 5 or 7, wherein said display means is an 
alphanumeric light-emitting diode (LED) or a backlighted liquid crystal display 

(LCD). 
The device of claim 1 or 7, wherein said respective ON/OFF switches 
are located within either respective handsets or respective cradles of said telephones. 
A mobile telephone system for mass-transit application comprising: 

(a) a plurality of transmission means having means for communicating a 
first message for directing a user in operating the telephone system and 

respective ON/OFF switches therein; 
(b) means for detecting and translating information from said ON/OFF 
switches thereby producing a code for each of said plurality of 

transmission means; 
(c) means for processing said code and producing a signal based on said 
code; 
(d) means for communicating a second message for directing the user to 
enter a calling card or credit card number; 
(e) means for terminating said second message;
