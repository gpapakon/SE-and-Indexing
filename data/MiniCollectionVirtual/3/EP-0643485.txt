<ABSTRACT>
If an IGBT (1) or power MOSFET is switched off in the event of overcurrent or short circuit of the load, high voltages occur across the stray inductances because of its essentially current-independent switching-off rate. The circuit contains a transistor (9) which is connected between gate and emitter and which, when an external turn-off signal (AUS) is chosen and overcurrent occurs at the same time, is driven into a range of high forward impedance.

Circuit arrangement for turning off a field
effect-controlled semiconductor component (1) in the

event of overcurrent, having a transistor (9) whose load
path is connected between the gate terminal and the

cathode terminal of the semiconductor component (1), the
transistor (9) being switched on by a control voltage,

and having a device (17) which, in the event of
overcurrent and the simultaneous presence of a turn-off

signal, sets the control voltage of the transistor in
such a way that the forward resistance of the transistor

is increased,

characterized in that a resistor (10) is connected in
series with the load path of the transistor (9), in that

the resistor terminal which is not connected to the
transistor (9) is connected to a common terminal (11), in

that two bipolar transistors (15, 16) which are connected
in series with regard to their load paths are connected

between the control input of the transistor and the
common terminal, in that the base terminal of the first

bipolar transistor (15) is connected to the node between
resistor (10) and transistor (9), in that the second

bipolar transistor (16) is switched on via its base
terminal in the event of overcurrent, and in that the

control input of the transistor (9) is connected via a
resistor (14) to the terminal (12) at which the turn-off

signal is present.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the base terminal of the second

bipolar transistor (16) is connected between the cathode 
terminal and a resistor (18) which is connected in the

current path of the field effect-controlled semiconductor
component (1).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the field effect-controlled

semiconductor component (1) has a "sense" terminal (S),
and in that the resistor (18) is connected to the "sense"

terminal.
