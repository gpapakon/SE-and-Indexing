<ABSTRACT>
Strain in a workpiece W is measured by sensing 
changes in spectral patterns produced by laser beams 

directed onto the workpiece. Lasers 11 and 21 direct 
beams B1 and B2 perpendicularly onto the surface of the 

workpiece at points spaced along the direction of strain. 
The different frequencies of the two beams are selected by 

filters 13 and 23 so that sensors 12 and 22 receive 
reflected light from the beams B1 and B2 respectively. 

The difference between the displacements of the spectral 
patterns detected by sensors 12 and 22 provides a measure 

of strain and is calculated by a computer 30 fed with the 
outputs of the sensors through A/D converters 14 and 24.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a strain measuring instrument for use in association with
material testing machines, and more particularly to an instrument for measuring any
strain such as elongation or contraction of a test piece in a non-contact manner with the
use of laser beams. In particular, the invention relates to a strain measuring instrument
comprising a source of laser beams for projecting at least one laser beam on a test
piece, image sensors for receiving reflected light from respective laser applied spots on
the test piece and an arithmetic means for calculating the amount of strain of the test
piece by reading outputs from the image sensors.It is known in the art to measure any strain involving dimensional change occurring in
a test piece through the observation of a speckle pattern produced on it when it, is
irradiated with a beam of laser. For example, Japanese Patent Publication (allowed)
No. 59-52963 and No. 61-27681 disclose a non-contact method for measuring a strain
at a real time by means of laser beams.The common practice with the above-identified two known methods is that a laser beam
is projected on a spot of a test piece, and the reflected light is converted by an image
sensor into electric signals depending upon the speckle pattern. Then the amount of
displacement of the speckle pattern is measured by seeking a function of correlation
between signals at the pre- and post-displacement. In the latter method (No. 61-27681),
in order to measure the amount of deformation of the test piece on the basis of the
measured displacement of speckle pattern, two laser beams are projected onto one spot at symmetrical 
angles on opposite sides of a reference normal axis, and a difference in displacement
between the speckle patterns produced by the two laser beams is obtained.
Alternatively a single laser beam is projected on the same spot and the reflected light
is observed at two spaced points so as to obtain a speckle pattern at each point of
observation. Then it is observed how the speckle patterns at these points are differently
displaced, and if any difference is found, the difference indicates that a deformation of
the test piece has occurred.. This method is designed to cancel the data about any
translation contained in the measured amount of displacement of each speckle pattern,
and retain the data about the amount of displacement at the laser applied spots.Apart from the methods utilizing speckle patterns, there is another method characterized
by utilization of Doppler
