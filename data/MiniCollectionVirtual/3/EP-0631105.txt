<ABSTRACT>
A method of measuring light reflected by a test sample with a microscopic 
photometric system. The test sample placed in an in-focus position of an 

objective is irradiated, and light reflected by the test sample is measured. Stray 
light generated by microscopic optics including the objective is measured with the 

test sample placed in an out-of-focus position of the objective. Light actually 
reflected by the test sample is determined from a difference between the reflected 

light and the stray light measured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microscopic photometric system for use in 
film thickness measurement, line width measurement or the like. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a method executed with use of such a 
microscopic photometric system to measure light reflected by minute test 
samples, and to a reflected light measuring apparatus. At a testing stage of a semiconductor manufacturing process, for example, a 
thickness of silicon oxide film formed on a silicon substrate is measured by first 
measuring light reflected by a surface of the substrate. A conventional apparatus used for measuring this reflected light will be 
described hereinafter in relation to a relative reflectance measuring apparatus. In this apparatus, light from a light source such as a halogen lamp, deuterium 
lamp or the like is reflected toward a sample by a half mirror mounted in the body 
tube of a microscope, and projected through an objective to a surface of the 
sample. Light reflected by the sample surface and having a predetermined 
wavelength range travels through the objective and the half mirror to a 
spectrophotometric unit. This spectrophotometric unit has an electromagnetic 
shutter disposed at an entrance thereof to open and close the entrance, and a 
pinhole disposed downstream of the shutter. The light having passed through the 
pinhole is dispersed by a concave diffraction grating and reaches a one-dimensional  
 
solid-state image pickup device. This image pickup device has a 
signal output connected to a CPU included in a data processor. The CPU also 
controls opening and closing of the electromagnetic shutter mentioned above. Methods of measuring a relative reflectance with this apparatus will be 
described next. In a first method, a sample to be used as a reference (a silicon substrate 
without silicon oxide film in this example) is placed on the stage of the 
microscope first of all. Intensity C(λ) of light reflected by the sample and incident 
upon the spectrophotometric unit is measured. Next, the electromagnetic shutter at the entrance is closed to darken the 
spectrophotometric unit. Then, a dark current D(λ) of the one-dimensional solid-state 
image pickup device is measured. A sample to be tested for relative reflectance (a silicon substrate having silicon 
oxide film in this example) is placed on the stage of the microscope next. 
Intensity M(λ) of light reflected by this test sample is measured after opening the 
electromagnetic shutter of the spectrophotometric unit. Based on the above
