<ABSTRACT>
A coating method characterized in that, when the surfaces of solid particles kept flowing are spray-coated with thermally 
melted wax, a two-fluid nozzle adapted to mix thermally melted wax with a heating gas in and eject the resultant mixture from 

one flow passage and eject the heating gas from the other is used, the two-fluid nozzle having spray ports the diameter of which is 
in the range of 1.5 - 5.8 mm, the two-fluid nozzle having no needle valves. According to this method, the use o
f an organic solvent 
for melting wax is omitted, and complicated operations for pulverizing wax and thermally melting wax powder after it has been 

deposited on solid particles are not required. This method also prevents the clogging of the nozzle, the powdering of melted wax 
and the forming of agglomerated particles of wax, and permits simple and easy production of sustained release medicine and 

medicine for masking materials of unpleasant and bitter tastes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating method of a wax on 
the solid particles. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
coating method which can make it available a simple and easy spray-coating 
of a thermally melted wax on the surfaces of solid particles kept 
flowing without using any organic solvent. There have been well known some methods for preparing 
sustained release preparations which control the release of an active 
ingredient therefrom, or preparations for masking materials of unpleasant 
and bitter tastes, which comprise coating a wax on the surfaces of solid 
particles containing an active ingredient. For example, there are disclosed a method of coating solid 
particles containing an active ingredient with a wax, which comprises 
dissolving a wax in an organic solvent and spraying the resultant solution 
on the surfaces of solid particles containing an active ingredient, and 
drying them (Japanese Patent Second Publication (Kokoku) No. 
26837/1965), a method of coating solid particles containing an active 
ingredient with a wax, which comprises pulverizing a wax to fine powder, 
depositing said fine powder on the surfaces of solid particles containing an 
active ingredient, further thermally melting thereof (Japanese Patent 
Second Publication (Kokoku) No. 3789/1965), and the like. Recently, it 
has been tried to effect the coating by thermally melting a wax and directly 
spraying the resultant (cf. PHARM TECH JAPAN, 7, 711-718 (1991)).  
 However, in the coating method which comprises dissolving a 
wax in an organic solvent and spraying the resultant solution, there are 
used as an organic solvent, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons such as 
carbon tetrachloride, chloroforrn, trichloroethane, etc., hydrocarbons such 
as hexane, benzene, etc., lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 
propanol, etc., ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, etc., and the 
use of these solvents has many problems, for example, bad effects on 
human beings, air pollution, and causes of disasters, etc. Besides, in order 
to avoid these problems, the method should be carried out in a closed 
system, and needs a large equipment such as an equipment for recovering 
organic solvents. Moreover, it has some problems in view of industrial 
efficiency, because the large amount of organic solvents are used and 
hence, it takes a lot of time to remove these solvents from the resulting 
preparations after coating. In the method which comprises pulverizing a wax to fine 
powder, depositing

<CLAIMS>
A coating method for spray-coating the surfaces of solid particles, which 
are kept flowing, with a thermally melted wax, which comprises ejecting a mixture of a 

thermally melted wax and a heating gas from one of the flow passages of a two-fluid 
nozzle and, simultaneously, ejecting a heating gas from the other flow passage of said 

two-fluid nozzle, the diameter of spray ports of said two-fluid nozzle being in the range 
of 1.5 to 5.8 mm, and said two-fluid nozzle having no needle valve. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the wax is a member 
selected from a group consisting of higher alcohols, higher fatty acids, 

higher fatty acid glycerin esters, fats and oils, waxes, higher 
hydrocarbons, or a mixture thereof, which are solid at ordinary 

temperature. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the temperature of the 
thermally melted wax and the heating gas are controlled so that the temperature thereof 

at the surfaces of the solid particles is 1 to 100Â°C higher than the melting point of said 
wax. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the pressure of the 
heating gas is in the range of 0.05 to 10 kg/cm

. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the solid particles are 
kept flowing by using a fluidized bed granulator, a centrifugal granulator, 

a conventional coating pan, a side vented coating pan, a vacuum coating 
pan, a high-shear mixer, or a combination of these apparatuses. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the solid particles are
