Central locking system for motor vehicles, including a 
number of actuators (1-4), each of which has a signal 

transmitter unit (12a-12d), which sends data signals to a 
control unit as a function of current condition parameters 

of an opening monitored by it and/or of an operating 
element of the motor vehicle, or as a function of 

externally input command signals, and the control unit 
generates control signals from these data signals, and 

final control elements of the central locking system, 
which bring about the locking and unlocking of the 

openings of the motor vehicle, are triggered by these 
control signals,
characterized
 in that each actuator (1-4) of 
the central locking system has a separate control unit 

(processor) (20a-20d), to which the data signals of the 
signal transmitter unit (12a; 12b; 12c; 12d) of its 

actuator (1; 2; 3; 4) as well as selected data signals of 
the signal transmitter units (12b-12d; 12a, 12c, 12d; 12a, 

12b, 12d; 12b-12d) of the other actuators (2-4; 1, 3, 4; 
2-4) of the central locking system are sent. 
Central locking system as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the data transmission 
among the actuators (1-4) of the central locking system is 

performed in time-division multiplex by way of a bus 
system (30) designed as a multi-master system. 
Central locking system as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the data transmission 
among the actuators (1-4) of the central locking system  

 
takes place by way of parallel lines (30a-30d), and the 

number of lines (30a-30d) corresponds to the number of 
bits of a condition message of the central locking system 

to be transmitted. 
Central locking system as claimed in claim 2 or 3,
characterized
 in that the actuators (1-4) of 
the central locking system have an interface logic each, 

which establishes the connection between the control unit 
(20a-20d) of each actuator (1-4) and the bus system (30). 
Central locking system as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the interface logic of 
each actuator (1-4) is connected to the bus system (30) by 

way of an output, especially an open collector output, and 
it generates a dominant level on the bus system. 
Central locking system as claimed in any one of the claims 
1 to 5,
characterized
 in that each condition message 
transmitted from the control unit (20a-20d) of the 

actuator (1-4) by way of the interface logic to the bus 
system (30) has a standardized structure, such that each 

condition message is transmitted to the bus system (30) in 
the form of a bit block of defined length, and that each 

bit block consists of a start bit and one or more message 
bits following it. 
Central locking system as claimed in claim 6,
characterized
 in that each bit block has a 
start bit end bit, which is transmitted after the start 

bit and before the first message bit, and the start bit  
 

and the start bit end bit have complementary values. 
Central locking system as claimed in any one of the claims 
1 to 6 or 7,
characterized
 in that the message bits 
represent parity bits or control bits or data signals, 

which are generated by signal transmitters (13a-13g; 13a'-13g') 
of the signal transmitter units (12a-12d). 
Central locking system as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that at least one signal 
transmitter (13c; 13c') of one signal transmitter unit 

(12a, 12b) of at least one actuator (1-4) of the central 
locking system responds to an external command signal, 

which is sent by the user of the motor vehicle to activate 
or deactivate a theft protection system cooperating with 

the central locking system. 
Central locking system as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that at least one signal 
transmitter (13d, 13e; 13d', 13e') of at least one 

actuator (1-4) of the central locking system responds to 
an external command signal, which is sent by the user of 

the motor vehicle to activate or deactivate a central 
locking system. 
Central locking system as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the signal transmitters 
of the signal transmitter units (12a-12d) are designed as 

Hall sensors (13a-13g) and/or as conventional switches 
(13a'-13g').  

 
Central locking system as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that only one actuator (2) 
of the actuators of the central locking system is used to 

trigger functional components (5) of the vehicle, whose 
activation depends on the condition parameters of the 

openings to be monitored, and which assume a function 
independent from the actual central locking system and/or 

theft protection system. 
Central locking system as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that each actuator (1-4) of 
the central locking system contains at least one drive 

(22, 23), which generates adjusting signals for the final 
control elements of the central locking system and/or the 

theft protection system.
