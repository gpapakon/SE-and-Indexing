<ABSTRACT>
When a multi-fiber type optical cable coupler obtained from a tape core wire (1) is fixed to a reinforcement 
case (3), a glass portion (2b) as a non-extension portion outside a fusing extension portion (2c) of the coupler and a 

protective cladding layer (2a) at the back of the glass portion (2b) are fixed by an adhesive layer (4). A collective 
coating resin layer (1a) of the tape core wire (1) is not fixed to the reinforcement case (3). When it is fixed, it is fixed 

to the reinforcement case (3) by a soft adhesive layer (5) different from the adhesive layer (4) described above. A 
resin having a viscosity of 50 to 200 P or a UV-curing and thermosetting resin is suitable as the resin of the adhesive 

layer (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a multiple-optical-
fiber coupler in which 2n optical core fibers
are melted, coupled and elongated.Generally, a conventional optical fiber coupler
has a drawback that it easily changes in
characteristics and is damaged due to external force
or temperature change, because it has a small outer
diameter portion of a few tens of µm. Therefore, the
conventional optical fiber coupler is designed such
that the coupler for the melted, coupled and elongated
optical fibers is fixed to a reinforcement substrate
having a linear expansion coefficient as much as
quartz, so that the characteristics are stable.As the reinforcement substrate, a plate member is
used as described in Japanese Utility Model
Application Laying-open No. 23408/1989 and a pipe
member is used as described in Japanese Patent
Application Laying-open No. 63907/1989, for example. On the other hand, thermosetting adhesive or
ultraviolet cure adhesive of epoxy, urethane acrylate,
and cyanoacrylate is used as the adhesive for adhering
the conventional coupler.Recently, a high density optical communication
line has developed so that the number of optical
couplers increases. Therefore, since the conventional
optical fiber coupler is designed to couple a pair of
optical fibers to each other, there are caused
problems that an occupied area by the optical fiber
coupler increases and accommodation of excess portions
at the ends of the optical fibers is complex.On the contrary, as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laying-open No. 295211/1990, for instance,
the reinforcing method of the optical fiber coupler is
proposed in which after an optical fiber coupler for
coupling two optical fibers is fixed to a
reinforcement member so that a plurality of
reinforcement members are accommodated in a package,
the optical fibers are coupled outside of the package
by a tape to construct an arrayed optical fiber
coupler. Another method of reinforcing an optical
fiber coupler is proposed in which optical fiber
couplers for each coupling two optical fibers to each
other are arranged on a fixing member having a
plurality of grooves in a comb manner, as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application Laying-open No.
254406/1988.The methods disclosed in the above Japanese Patent
Application Laying-open No. 295211/1990 and Japanese
Patent Application Laying-open No. 254406/1988 are
complicated and have a problem that it takes a long
time to form an arrayed optical fiber coupler because
the optical fiber couplers for
