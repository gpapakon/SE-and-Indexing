<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing
a substrate for a recording head
according to the preamble of claim 1, wherein said recording
head is
to be used in an ink jet recording
device which performs recording by forming droplets
of ink by discharging ink and attaching the droplets
onto a recording medium such as paper, etc., and
to a method of preparing an ink jet
head. Principal structure of a recording head of
the type utilizing heat energy as the ink discharging
energy are exemplarily shown in Figs. 1A and 1B.The recording head has a structure formed by
bonding a substrate comprising an electrothermal
transducer as heat generating means provided for
converting electrical energy to heat energy to be
utilized for ink discharge arranged on the surface
exhibiting insulating property of a support 1, and
further, if necessary, an upper layer 4 as the protective
layer provided at least on the heat-generating resistor
2 and electrodes 3 to be positioned finally below
a liquid path 6 and a liquid chamber 10 having an
ink supply opening 9, to a covering member 5 having
a recession for the liquid path 6 and the liquid chamber
10, etc. formed thereon.The discharging energy for ink discharge in
this recording head is imparted by the electrothermal
transducer having a pair of electrodes 3 and a heat-generating
resistor 2 connected electrically to these
electrodes. That is, when current is applied on the
electrodes 3 to generate heat from the heat generating 
portion 8 of the heat-generating resistor 2, the ink
in the liquid path 6 near the heat-generating portion
8 is momentarily heated to generate bubbles thereat,
and through volume change by momentary volume expansion
and shrinkage by generation of the bubbles, ink are
discharged as a droplet from a discharge opening.As the representative method for preparing
the electrothermal transducer of the substrate in
such constitution of the recording head as described
above, there has been known the method as disclosed
in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 59-194859
according to the steps, in which at first a heat-generating
resistor layer comprising HfB2, etc. and
an electrode layer comprising Al, etc. are successively
laminated on an appropriate support, next the electrode
layer is etched to a predetermined shape by use of
an etchant, and then the heat-generating resistor
layer is further etched to a predetermined shape with
the use of an etchant.Whereas, according to such method, during
etching of the heat-generating resistor layer, the
etchant will
