<ABSTRACT>
A field-emission display has a phosphor panel assembly 
comprising a transparent electrode (12), a plurality of 

coated phosphor layers (15) disposed on said transparent electrode (12) 
for emitting light in response to bombardment of electron 

beams emitted from field-emission cathodes, a plurality of 
black insulating layers (13) disposed between said coated phosphor 

layers (15), and a plurality of conductive layers (14) disposed on said 
black insulating layers (13), respectively, between said coated 

phosphor layers (15) and electrically insulated from said transparent 
electrode (12) by said black insulating layer (13).

 
The black insulating layers (13) provide a black mask between the 

phosphor layers to improve the contrast ratio, and the conductive 
layers are effective to increase the percentage of 

electron beam utilization, thus improving the quality and 
resolution of displayed images. These advantages can be 

achieved without making image display unstable due to charging-up 

of the black mask and straying of secondary electrons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a field-emission 
display having low-speed electron beam phosphor layers for 
emitting light in response to bombardment of an electron beam 
applied from field-emission cathodes. Electron-beam excited field-emission display devices 
include a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) employing a 
low-speed electron beam phosphor layers, so-called Aiken and 
Gerber tubes, a flat display in the form of a secondary electron 
multiplier, and a display with a matrix drive system. Most of these displays are energized at a high 
voltage, and hence it is difficult to lower their power consumption. The VFDs are low-voltage excited displays. Since 
the VFDs have not been advanced to a technical level for displaying 
television images, and have a relatively low resolution, 
there have been no reports on attempts to produce high-contrast 
VFDs for displaying high-quality, high-resolution 
NTSC and high-definition television images. Research and development efforts have been made to 
field-emission displays (FEDs) employing field-emission microcathodes 
which can be energized at a low voltage and have 
a relatively high resolution. A flat field-emission display comprises an ultra-thin 
display panel having microtip cathodes in the form of  
 
very small conical cathodes fabricated according to a micro-fabrication 
process. Electrons are emitted from the microtip 
cathodes and applied to excite a confronting phosphor panel 
to display signals. One such flat field-emission display is 
schematically illustrated in FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings. As shown in FIG. 1, the flat field-emission display 
has a cathode panel 1 made of glass or the like, and a plurality 
of cathode electrodes 2 made of Cr or the like which 
are patterned in stripes on the cathode panel 1. A plurality 
of gate electrodes 4 made of Mo, W, or the like are patterned 
as stripes perpendicular to the cathode electrodes 2 on insulating 
layers 3 which are deposited on the cathode electrodes 
2. The cathode electrodes 2 and the gate electrodes 4 have 
areas of intersection which have a plurality of small holes 5 
defined therein, each of the small holes 5 housing a cathode 
therein. FIG. 2 of the accompanying drawings schematically 
shows a cathode arrangement of the flat field-emission display. 
After the cathode electrodes 2, the gate electrodes 4, 
and the insulating layers 3 have been successively deposited 
by sputtering, vacuum evaporation, or the like, holes 5 are 
defined by wet etching, for example. Thereafter,
