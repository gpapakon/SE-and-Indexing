<ABSTRACT>
In the catalytic conversion of at least two reactants in a flow medium, it is necessary to bring the reactants into contact with a catalyst in a suitable mutual stoichiometric ratio, in order to achieve high deposition coefficients with simultaneously low creep (slip) of the reactants. Measurement of the concentration of the reactants such as, for example, NH3 and NOx in the flow medium is technically laborious and expensive, in particular for the examples mentioned. In order to overcome this deficiency, the invention provides a sensor (4, 46) for determining the variation in the concentration of an adsorbable material (NH3), which diffuses out of a flow medium (36) and into the sensor material (34, 54) via a surface (33) of the sensor material (34, 54), as a function of the distance to this surface (33), in which the sensor material (34, 54) is provided with contact pairs (12, 62) provided with electrical supply lines (16, 18, 58), in the sensor material (34) and, if appropriate, on the surface (33) of the sensor material (34, 54), by means of which the electrical conductivity of the sensor material (34, 54) between the contacts (28, 30, 62) of the individual contact pairs can be determined. By measuring the variation in the electrical conductivity as a function of the material depth, it is possible to deduce the concentration of the material adsorbed onto the sensor material and the concentration of this material in the flow medium. The sensor is particularly suitable for supporting the deposition of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases of diesel and lean-burn engines.
