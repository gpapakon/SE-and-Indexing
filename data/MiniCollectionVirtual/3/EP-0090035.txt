<DESCRIPTION>
 VOLTAGE REGULATION AND BATTERY DISSIPATION LIMITER CIRCUITTechnical FieldThis invention relates to a voltage regulator 5 circuit. The invention further relates to a voltage supply system which provides voltage regulation to a utilization circuit while the normal supply of power thereto is available and which includes a battery back¬ up circuit, the utilization circuit being arranged to 10 be operated from the battery when the normal supply of power is disrupted.Background Art •Certain computer systems, for example, utilize dynamic random access memories (RAMs) which must be per- 15 iodically refreshed by a regulated voltage supply system in order to retain the data stored therein. Usually, these systems provide a battery back-up circuit to re¬ fresh the RAMs in the event of a power failure. Gen¬ erally, these back-up circuits are designed to provide 20 power to refresh the RAMs for a time period of about 72 hours, which period covers a usual weekend in which a power failure may occur while the system may be left unattended. In some countries, it is necessary to dis¬ connect the computer systems from the usual power recep- 25 tacles as a safety measure when the systems are left un¬ attended over a weekend, and in these situations the battery back-up circuits are periodically used. -. The batteries which are typically used in these battery back-up circuits are of the re-chargeable 30 .type. These batteries can be recharged after normal use providing that they are not drained beyond what is termed a "deep discharge" level. However, if they are drained beyond the deep discharge level, it is difficult to re¬ charge them, and consequently it may be necessary to 35 replace them at considerable expense. 

Disclosure of the InventionIt is an object of the invention to provide a voltage regulator circuit which alleviates the risk of an associated back-up battery being drained beyond the. deep discharge level.According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a voltage regulator circuit including input means arranged to be connected to a D.C. voltage source, and output means arranged to be connected to a load, characterized by a first circuit portion which in¬ cludes means coupled to said input means for establishing a reference Voltage, and input voltage responsive means for producing a first output when the input voltage at said input means falls to a predetermined critical level and for producing a second output while the voltage at said input means is above said critical level; and a second circuit
