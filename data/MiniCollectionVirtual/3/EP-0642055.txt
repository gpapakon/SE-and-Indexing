<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming an image is disclosed, comprising 
imagewise-exposing a silver halide photographic light 

sensitive material and developing the exposed photographic 
material to form a high contrast image, wherein said silver 

halide photographic material contains a spectral sensitizing 
dye represented by the following formula [S]
, and wherein said 
photographic material is developed with a developer having a 

pH of 10.9 or less, said developer being replenished by a 
developer-replenishing solution having a pH value of 10.9 or 

less in an amount of 300 ml or less per mÂ² of the photographic 
material. The photographic material further contains a 

hydrazine compound and a nucleation-accelerating agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming method
which is stable and free from residual color stains.In recent years, development of a laser light source
emitting a light of a red wavelength region has made the use
of a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material
recorded by the laser source active in the printing or medical
fields. Particularly in the printing field a large amount of
facsimile films or scanner films are used, and a helium-neon
laser having an output wavelength of 632.8, a semiconductor
laser having an output wavelength of 650-700 nm and a light
emitting diode (LEWD) are used.However, a dye having a high spectral sensitivity in a
red-light wavelength region is difficult to dissolve out on
development, and the elimination of the residual color stains
is insufficient when rapid processing or a small amount of 
replenishing is conducted as in recent years. As a result, a
serious problem occurs in view of photographic properties or
commercial value.Improvment of such residual color stains of the
light sensitive material is disclosed in U.S.Patent Nos.
2,493,747 and 2,526,632 incorporating a water solubilizing
group to a cyanine dye. Further, there are proposed methods
that use a three nuclear merocyanine dye disclosed in Japanese
Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection No.2-143242 and a
three nuclear merocyanine dye having two water solubilizing
groups disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public
Inspection No.3-171135.However, when the replenishing amount of a developer
replenisher is small, such as not more than 300ml/m2 of a light
sensitive material and the pH of a developer is not more than
10.9, these sensitizing dyes had problems in that the dyes
dissolved out of the light sensitive material or decomposition
products thereof accumulated in the developer and had an
adverse effect on photographic properties, and in that the
developer was dyed resulting in dyeing of the light sensitive
material. Particularly, the problems are remarkable in a
hybrid light sensitive material containing a tetrazolium salt
likely to be influenced by development conditions, a hydrazine
compound or a pyridium salt as a contrast increasing agent.
Therefore, a new development technique has been demanded on
small amounts of replenishing. An objective of the invention is to provide an image
forming method which is improved in fog and black spot,
furthermore, stable and free from residual color stains in the
case of small amounts of replenishing.The above problems can be solved by an
