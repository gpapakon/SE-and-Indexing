the terminals of the head (65,66) and other devices is easy, which is 

suitable for the mass production of magnetic 
recording/reproducing equipment and which is highly reliable 

comprises a pair of bases (2,32) facing each other, a thin film 
coil (19,49) formed on at least one of the bases, and a terminal 

portion (5,6) connected to the thin film coil formed on the same base; 
a portion of the other base is cut away and the terminal 

portion is exposed at this cutaway portion (32a) and the terminal 
portion is formed at the cutaway portion on a surface 

intersecting the main surface of the magnetic head at an 
obtuse angle (ϑ).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic head and to for
example a magnetic head suitable for a video tape recorder or
a magnetic disk unit.In magnetic recording and reproducing devices such as
video tape recorders (VTRs), digital recording, wherein
signals are digitized before being recorded in order to
improve the picture quality, is being advanced, and recording
densities and recording frequencies are being increased to
realize this digital recording.With the adoption of higher densities and frequencies of
magnetic recording, high output at high frequencies and low
noise is required of magnetic heads used for recording and
reproduction. For example, with a so-called compound
metal-in-gap head which is widely used as a magnetic head for
VTRs and comprises a ferrite material coated with a metallic
magnetic film and wire-wound, the inductance of the head is
high and because of output reduction due to the inductance
the output of the head in high frequency regions is low and
consequently it is difficult to achieve satisfactory digital
image recording, which requires high frequency and high
density, with this type of head.In view of this, the use of so-called thin film magnetic 
heads made by thin film forming processes as magnetic heads
capable of handling high frequencies has been being studied.A thin film magnetic head is made by forming a coil in
a spiral shape on a ceramic substrate using a thin film
forming method such as photolithography and forming a
protective film of an oxide such as alumina thereon. One
terminal extending from the coil and the another terminal
electrically connected to the coil are left exposed without
any protective film being formed thereon.Particularly in manufacturing a magnetic head for a VTR,
in order to stabilize the sliding characteristics between the
magnetic head and the magnetic tape it is preferable that a
substrate made of the same material as the ceramic substrate
be affixed to the magnetic head after it is formed or that a
pair of magnetic head halves made by thin film forming
processes be adhered together at the magnetic gap portion.
In this case, the terminals can be exposed at the end surface
of the magnetic head after the magnetic head is made by the
length dimension of the magnetic head half on the side where
terminals were formed being made smaller than the length
dimension of the other magnetic head half.In the case of a magnetic head for a VTR, it is usual
for the magnetic head (the head tip) to be adhered to a head
mounting base. Fig. 1 shows a magnetic head
