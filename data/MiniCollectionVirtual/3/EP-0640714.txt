<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an iron (1) comprising a metal soleplate 
(2) which is 

provided with an anti-friction layer (3) of an inorganic polymer, 
preferably of polysilicate, 

which is provided by means of a sol-gel process. Such anti-friction 
layers exhibit a high 

hardness, a high corrosion resistance and a satisfactory resistance 
against rapid 

temperature variations. The anti-friction layer preferably also 
comprises fluoridized 

hydrocarbon compounds. By virtue of these compounds the anti-friction 
layer has a 

higher coefficient of friction which is comparable to that of teflon. 
The anti-friction 

layer can be provided in various ways. Preferably, it is provided by 
spraying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an iron comprising a metal
soleplate which is provided with an anti-friction layer. The
invention also relates to a method of providing an anti-friction
layer on a metal soleplate.An iron of the type mentioned in the opening
paragraph is known per se. For example, in German Patent
Specification DE 36.17.034, a description is given of an iron
whose soleplate is provided with an anti-friction layer which
is composed of at least two sub-layers. The first sub-layer
consists of a base layer of, for example, aluminium oxide or
a mixture of aluminium oxide and titanium oxide, which is
applied to the metal soleplate by, for example, plasma
spraying. Said base layer is provided with a second sub-layer
of synthetic resin, for example on the basis of teflon.The known iron has disadvantages. For example, it
has been found that, in particular, the mechanical strength
of the anti-friction layer is insufficient. This is caused
by, in particular, the relatively low scratch resistance of
the synthetic resin layer. It has further been found that the
stability of the synthetic resin layer presents problems. The
stability of synthetic resins at temperatures of maximally
approximately 300Â°C, which are customary for irons, is
generally not optimal. In addition, the provision of a double
layer, as described with respect to the known anti-friction
layer, is time-consuming and expensive.DE-A 21.51.858 also describes an iron with a metal
soleplate comprising an antifriction layer. Said layer
consists of silicon oil, a silicon emulsion or a silicon
lacquer. Layers of such silicon material are neither hard nor
scratch resistant and are easily removed during ironing.GB 956.740 discloses household appliances, such as
irons, having an antifriction layer. Said layer is sprayed on 
a surface of the appliances and consists of a metal of
aluminium or its alloys, copper or its alloys, copper-nickel
alloys or irons or its alloys, whereby pores within the layer
are filled with non-stick material, such as fluorocarbon
polymers.EP-A 227.111 describes another iron with an
antifriction layer. Said layer comprises a first sprayed
layer of ceramic or metallic material. A second layer of
organic binder material is subsequently sprayed on said first
layer.It is an object of the invention to provide an iron
in which the above disadvantages have been overcome. The
invention more particularly aims at providing an iron
comprising a metal soleplate whose anti-friction layer has a
high scratch resistance. It should be possible to
