<ABSTRACT>
DNA constructs comprise a DNA sequence homologous to some or all of the gene encoded by the clone pTOM75. The constructs may further comprise a transcriptional initiation region operative in plants for transcribing this DNA sequence, optionally in the antisense direction to produce mRNA complementary to the pTOM75 gene. From such constructs may be derived transformed plant cells and plants in which expression of the pTOM75 gene is inhibited: fruit from the plants (such as tomatoes) can show modified ripening properties, such as increased acid content.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DNA, DNA CONSTRUCTS, CELLS AND PLANTS DERIVED THEREFROMThis application relates to novel DNA constructs, plant cells containing them and plants derived therefrom. In particular it involves the control of gene expression in plants .As is well known, a cell manufactures protein by transcribing the DNA of the gene for that protein to produce messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then processed (eg by the removal of introns) and finally translated by ribosomes into protein. This process may be inhibited by the presence in the cell of "antisense RNA". By this term is meant an RNA sequence which is complementary to a sequence of bases in the mRNA in question: complementary in the sense that each base (or the majority of bases) in the antisense sequence (read in the 3' to 5' sense) is capable of pairing with the corresponding base (G with C, A with U) in the mRNA sequence read in the 5' to 3' sense. It is believed that this inhibition takes place by formation of a complex between the two complementary strands of RNA, preventing the formation of protein. How this works is uncertain: the complex may interfere with further transcription, processing, transport or translation, or degrade the mRNA, or have more than one of these effects. Such antisense RNA may be produced in the cell by transformation with an appropriate DNA construct arranged to transcribe backwards part of the coding strand (as opposed to the template strand) of the relevant gene (or of a DNA sequence showing substantial homology therewith). 

 The use of this technology to downregulate the expression of specific plant genes has been described, for example in European Patent publication no 271988 to ICI (corresponding to US serial 119614). Reduction of gene expression has led to a change in the phenotype of the plant: either at the level of gross visible phenotypic difference e.g. lack of anthocyanin production in flower petals of petunia leading to colourless instead of coloured petals (van der Krol et al, Nature, 333, 866-869, 1988); or at a more subtle biochemical level e.g. change in the amount of polygalacturonase and reduction in depoly erisation of pectins during tomato fruit ripening (Smith et al, Nature, 334, 724-726, 1988; Smith et al, Plant Mol. Biol. 14, 369-380, 1990). Thus antisense RNA has been proven to be useful in achieving downregulation of gene expression in plants.In work leading to the present invention we have identified a gene which expresses a protein during the ripening of tomatoes. This gene is also expressed in roots and
