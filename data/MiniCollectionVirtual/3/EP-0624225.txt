<ABSTRACT>
A control (1) for at least two stabilizing arms (2) in a drilling or boring device, and particularly arms (2) in a drilling or boring head. Each arm has an end pivotable about an axis (6) parallel to the drilling head axis (4) and including, for each arm (2), a piston (8) for pivoting the arm about said axis (6) between two end positions, i.e. a first position in which it is housed in the head and a second position in which it projects therefrom. Control (10) and synchronizing (11) means are respectively arranged to move the pistons (8) away from the drilling fluid substantially simultaneously in the same direction and with the same amplitude.

Control (1) of at least two stabilizing 
arms (2) in a drill or core device, in particular 

stabilizing arms (2) in a drill or core bit (3), each arm 
(2) being offset with respect to the other over the 

circumference of the bit (3) and having an extremity 
which is pivoted about an axis (6) parallel to the axis 

(4) of the drill bit (3) in such a manner that the free 
extremity (7) of the arm (2) is situated upstream of said 

pivot axis (6) with respect to the rotation direction 
(77) of the bit (3) during drilling, the control being 

characterized in that it comprises, per arm (2), a piston 
(8) arranged for pivoting the arm (2) about said axis (6) 

so that the free extremity (7) of the arm (2) takes in 
two extreme positions, a first so-called rest position 

wherein the arm is housed in the bit (3) and a second so-called 
operative position wherein said free extremity (7) 

projects with respect to said bit (3), control means (10) 
and synchronization means (11) being arranged respectively 

for displacing the pistons (8) by the drill fluid and 
in order that the pistons (8) act substantially simultaneously 

in the same direction and according to the same 
amplitude. 
Control (1) according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the longitudinal axes (12) of the 

pistons (8) are tangential to an imaginary cylinder 
coaxial to the bit (3), and preferably in that they are 

comprised in at least one plane transverse to the axis 
(4) of the drill bit (3). 
Control (1) according to either one of 
the claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the means (10) 

for controlling the pistons (8) comprise an annular 
piston (13) which is coaxial to the bit (3), arranged in 

order to be able to be displaced according to their 
common axis (4) in a cylinder (14) formed in the bit (3), 

and shaped, on the one hand, for being actuated by the  
 

drill fluid and, on the other hand, for acting on a fluid 
which actuates each of said pistons (8) and which is 

contained in the cylinder (14) in communication with the 
chambers (9) of the pistons (8). 
Control (1) according to either one of 
the claims 2 and 3, characterized in that the synchronization 

means (11) comprise a toothed rack (24) provided 
on each of the pistons (8) and a crown wheel (25) which 

is coaxial to the bit (3) and which meshes with all of 
the toothed racks (24) associated to the pistons (8). 
Control (1) according to either one of 
the claims 3 and 4, characterized in that the crown wheel 

(25) is mounted around the annular piston (13), in such 
a manner that it can rotate freely about this piston, and 

is housed in a tight chamber (26) which is in communication 
with the chambers (9) of the pistons (8) and with 

said cylinder (14). 
Control (1) according to claim 5, 
characterized in that the chamber (9) of each piston (8) 

and/or this piston are arranged in such a manner that the 
piston (8) is entirely subjected to the action of the 

fluid, the transverse section of the piston rod (80) 
being preferably smaller than the corresponding section 

of the piston (8).
