<ABSTRACT>
The diode (13) is incorporated in a fixed manner on 
the optical axis (14) of 

a carrier lens (12). The carrier lens (12) consists 
of a front portion (18) with 

an outer transverse surface (25), formed concave towards the emitted 
light, and a longitudinal portion (19) for incorporating the diode (13). 
The longitudinal portion (19) 
has its outer longitudinal surface (22) formed 

concave towards the diode. The concave transverse surface (22) is 
surrounded by a further outer transverse system. The concave 

longitudinal surface (22) is arranged to reflect the diode-emitted 
light rays (30) towards the further outer transverse surface (24), which is 

arranged to transmit the light rays to the outside in a 
longitudinal direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical system for light emitting
diodes.An optical system for light emitting diodes (LEDs) is known in
which the diode, which acts as a light-emitting semiconductor
element, is incorporated in a fixed manner on the optical axis of a
carrier lens. The carrier lens consists of a front portion with
an outer transverse surface formed concave towards the emitted
light, and a longitudinal portion with an outer longitudinal
surface, for incorporating the diode.
For example, US-A-4,698,730 and US-A-5,173,810 disclose
optical systems according to the preamble of claim 1.
This optical system has the drawback that the light rays are
emitted with considerable dispersion, causing wastage of the
emitted light energy and a consequent limitation in the
performance of the optical system. This dispersion is also very
influenced by the extent of the geometrical tolerances in
positioning the LED relative to the carrier lens, which acts as a
container and rigidifies the position of the constituent elements
of the active part of the LED. These geometrical tolerances are
practically inevitable with current LED production methods,
because of which the optical systems are produced only in a few
limited types without particular adaptation and personalization to 
the emitting element. Manufacturers are therefore compelled to
apply a careful selection procedure to the LEDs produced, with
substantial cost increase, in order to market homogeneous batches.Moreover, in order to overcome these drawbacks DE-A-2,510,267
discloses a light-emitting unit, in which a
diode is fixed in an inner lens element that is
secured in a cavity by an intermediate lens element
positioned between the inner lens element and a
carrier lens element, and formed by in-situ
polymerisation. However, the longitudinal part of the
outer lens element is cylindrical and the inner
element has a corresponding shape; this causes a
problem in fitting the inner element in the outer
element, since even in this case, the tolerances
concerning size and shape of the inner element may be
quite small.The object of the present invention is to provide an optical
system which does not present said drawbacks and which enables
high intensity to be achieved with only modest dispersion.
This object is achieved according to the invention by an optical
system for light emitting diodes, according to claim 1.This optical system of the present invention has the advantage
that the performance of the optical system is considerably
increased by the reduction in
