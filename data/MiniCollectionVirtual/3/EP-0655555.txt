<ABSTRACT>
A scroll machine has an intermediate pressure cavity which is operable to 
open and close a leakage path between the discharge zone and the suction zone 

of the scroll machine. The leakage path is closed when intermediate pressurized 
fluid is supplied to the cavity and the leakage path is open when the cavity is open 

to the suction zone of the compressor. A valve which can be mechanical or 
electrical is used to open and close a passageway extending between the cavity 

and the suction zone of the machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to scroll machines, and more
particularly to the elimination of reverse rotation problems in scroll machines such
as those used to compress refrigerant in refrigerating, air-conditioning and heat
pump systems.Scroll machines are becoming more and more popular for use as
compressors in both refrigeration as well as air conditioning and heat pump
applications due primarily to their capability for extremely efficient operation.
Generally, these machines incorporate a pair of intermeshed spiral wraps, one of
which is caused to orbit relative to the other so as to define one or more moving
chambers which progressively decrease in size as they travel from an outer suction
port towards a center discharge port. An electric motor is normally provided
which operates to drive the orbiting scroll member via a suitable drive shaft.Because scroll compressors depend upon a seal created between opposed
flank surfaces of the wraps to define successive chambers for compression, suction
and discharge valves are generally not required. However, when such compressors
are shut down, either intentionally as a result of the demand being satisfied, or
unintentionally as a result of a power interruption, there is a strong tendency for
the pressurized chambers and/or backflow of compressed gas from the discharge
chamber to effect a reverse orbital movement of the orbiting scroll member and
the associated drive shaft. This reverse movement often generates noise or
rumble which may be considered objectionable and undesirable. Further, in
machines employing a single phase drive motor, it is possible for the compressor
to begin running in the reverse direction should a momentary power failure be
experienced. This reverse operation may result in overheating of the compressor
and/or other damage to the apparatus. Additionally, in some situations, such as
a blocked condenser fan, it is possible for the discharge pressure to increase
sufficiently to stall the drive motor and effect a reverse rotation thereof. As the
orbiting scroll orbits in the reverse direction, the discharge pressure will decrease
to a point where the motor again is able to overcome this pressure head and orbit
the scroll member in the forward direction. However, the discharge pressure will 
again increase to a point where the drive motor is stalled
and the cycle is repeated. Such cycling is undesirable in
that it results in excessive stresses on various components
within the compressor. These components must then be
increased
