<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid data underflow situation 
in a printing apparatus capable of generating second 

data such as bit map data from first data with a limited 
bit map memory capacity, the printing apparatus is 

provided with a discriminating unit for discriminating 
whether a memory for storing the second data can be 

secured, and a selecting unit for selecting either 
a first mode for generating the second data with a 

first resolving power or a second mode for generating 
the second data with a second resolving power lower 

than the first resolving power, according to the result 
of discrimination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing
apparatus for receiving input data from an information
processing apparatus such as a host computer and
generating and printing output data, and a printing
method therefor.In a printing apparatus generating pixels by
a scanning process, such as a laser beam printer, a
full-raster image of the image to be printed has to
be prepared in a bit map memory, prior to the printing
operation. This is based on a fact that the page
printing operation of the printing apparatus is conducted
with the scanning process of a constant speed. Once
the page printing operation is initiated, the printing
process is conducted with a constant speed until said
operation is completed. Consequently, in order to
avoid a situation called data underflow, in which the
data to be printed are deficient in the print engine,
the entire image to be printed is converted into a
raster image in the bit map memory prior to the printing
operation. During the actual image printing operation,
a CPU in the printing apparatus monitors the bit map
memory and confirms that the raster image is supplied 
to the printer engine with the speed of the printing
operation.For printing a simple black-and-white image
of a low resolving power, for example of 300 dot/inch
(dpi), on a standard-sized sheet for example of 8½"
x 11" with such printing system, there is required
a bit map memory of about 1 megabytes (Mb). Since
such memory of 1 Mb is inexpensive, it is not critical
even if a major part of the memory is not used for
a long time. The situation is same also when the bit
map memory has a capacity of 2 Mb, constituting a double
buffer memory system. Such double buffer system is
preferable in that the image data of the current page
can be printed from a buffer while the CPU prepares
the raster image in the other buffer from the image
data of a next page. Thus such double buffer system
allows to continuously transfer the raster image data
to the printer engine, thereby improving the throughput
in the page without significant increase in the cost.On the other hand, for a resolving power of
600 dpi, there is required, for storing the full-raster
image, a memory capacity of four times in comparison
with the case of 300 dpi. Also an even larger memory
capacity will be required for an intermediate-tone
image or a color image. For example, for an
intermediate-tone image with 16 density levels for
each pixel, there is required a memory capacity of 
4 bits per pixel. By multiplication of the memory
capacity of 4 Mb
