<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating a high pressure
discharge lamp with which the high pressure discharge lamp supplies a luminous flux of at
least 60% of the nominal luminous flux 1 s after ignition.Important types of high-pressure discharge lamps are high-pressure sodium
lamps, high-pressure mercury lamps and metal halide lamps. A comparatively high luminous
flux immediately after switching-on of the lamp is required especially when a high-pressure
discharge lamp serves as a motorcar headlamp. Metal halide lamps whose discharge vessel
contain inter alia Xe are particularly suitable for motorcar headlamp applications.From EP-A-0534280 is known a circuit for operating a high-pressure
discharge lamp for a motorcar. The known circuit is provided with
a dc converter (static converter) for converting the input voltage from a car battery,a dc-ac converter for providing the lamp with ac current,means for current stabilization during lamp operation through controlling of the dc
converter, containing means for providing an instantaneous lamp power signal, andmeans for operating the lamp with an increased run-up current and an increased power of
a constant value, as compared with nominal operation of the lamp on the basis of an
instantaneous lamp voltage signal.According to the known circuit the instantaneous lamp voltage signal
determines the moment that the increased power at which the lamp is operated is followed by
a transitional portion to nominal operation which portion has a falling characteristic with a
lamp voltage independent time constant.An aspect of the known circuit is that the constant level of the increased power
might easily result in an overpowering of the lamp leading to possible light output
fluctuations.A further circuit arrangement is known from EP-A-443795.A disadvantage of known arrangements is that the luminous flux of the lamp
after ignition in the case of a cold start exhibits a considerable fluctuation during the run-up
of the lamp to a stable operating condition. This fluctuation may amount to more than half
the nominal luminous flux under certain circumstances. The occurrence of such a major 
luminous flux fluctuation is unpleasant both for the user and for the other road users, and
may even lead to hazardous traffic situations.The nominal lamp voltage often lies between 60 and 110 V in practice.
This depends to a high degree on the lamp manufacturing technology.
A reduction of the nominal lamp voltage, all other circumstances remaining the same, will
lead
