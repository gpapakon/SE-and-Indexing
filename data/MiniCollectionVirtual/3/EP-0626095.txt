<ABSTRACT>
It is usual to keep audio or video cassettes with a front label in the individual compartments of a support. The object of the invention is to make it easier to find determined cassettes or recordings. The compartments (2) of the support (1) contain contact sets that cooperate with contacts of the memory (M) of a cassette (3) inserted into the compartment (2) and that are connected with a cassette selection control panel (7) that cooperates with a central memory (9). The invention is particularly suitable for video cassettes.

<CLAIMS>
Cassette including a recording medium and a semiconductor memory for items of data that
are typical of the cassette, said semiconductor memory being disposed on the cassette housing

and its contacts being contactable by the contact set of a device for evaluating the items of
data, characterised in that, the cassette is stored in a protective sleeve (29) and the protective

sleeve (29) comprises means (31, 35, 36) in the vicinity of the memory (M) by means of
which the contacts (26) can be contacted externally by the contact set (33) (Fig. 3).
Cassette in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, the wall (30) of the protective
sleeve (29) comprises a plurality of holes (31) which are associated with the contacts (26)

and/or the wall (30) of the protective sleeve (29) comprises an elongated opening (35) which
extends over several or all of the contacts (26) located in a row (Fig. 4).
Cassette in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that, the holes (31) or openings (35)
are dimensioned such that resilient contact fingers (33) provided on the device engage in the

holes (31) or openings (35) by virtue of their springiness and impinge on the contacts (26).
Cassette in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, a part (46) consisting of a Zebra-connector
is inserted into the wall (30) of the protective sleeve (29) (Fig. 5).
