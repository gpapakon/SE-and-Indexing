<ABSTRACT>
A gate array architecture is disclosed that utilizes 
significantly less silicon area than the prior art. The core cell 

includes a four transistor arrangement in which a substrate tap is 
located adjacent to the transistor pair. This provides for a more 

"symmetric" cell array than those in the prior art. Through the 
placement of the taps outside of the transistors the power line 

connections can be routed in a simple and efficient manner. The 
architecture includes an extension portion in the contact region of 

the cell to further reduce wiring complexity. In addition the gate 
array architecture mirrors pairs of transistor columns to allow for 

the sharing of substrate taps between pairs of columns. This 
mirroring feature further reduces routing complexity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a complementary metal-oxide 
silicon (CMOS) logic gate array and more particularly to a CMOS 
logic gate array having a plurality of core cells. Gate arrays are used in VLSI integrated circuit chips to 
implement MOSFET circuits in semiconductor wafers. An MOS gate 
array consists of an array of MOS transistor sources and drains 
separated by channels, above which are formed gates to control the 
conductivity of the channels and thus the state of the transistors. 
An array of these gates (and their sources and drains) becomes 
functional only when connected by conductive wiring to appropriate 
other elements. Generally, the connecting is accomplished in two steps: a 
library of macrocells is available to translate simple frequently 
used logic functions such as NAND, flip-flop, AND, multiplexer, and 
counter into a gate array wiring pattern, then the macrocells are 
connected together to form the complex logic functions of the VLSI 
chip. Although conceptually there are two steps, the actual 
metallization to accomplish the two steps is laid out in as few 
layers as possible, preferably two, so the metal to implement a 
single macrocell and the metal to connect macrocells to each other  
 
is in the same metallization layers. Therefore if an area in a 
metal layer is used for connecting points within a macrocell, it is 
not also available for connecting macrocells to each other. There has been considerable interest in implementing complex 
logic operations on smaller areas of semiconductor material, while 
simultaneously retaining the flexibility provided by a gate array 
in which identical structural units or core cells repeat throughout 
a large portion of the semiconductor area. A gate array structure 
consists generally of a base array of many active areas which can 
be fabricated as a standard product on which is formed one or more 
"personality layers" comprising conductive material to interconnect 
the active areas into a desired logical structure. The personality layers reflect the function or functions to 
be implemented by the finished array. A given base array can be 
used to implement many different functions by appropriately 
designing the personality layers. Thus a gate array allows many 
different logic functions to be implemented using the same base 
array. The geometry of the base array cell affects the ability of 
the designer using later metallization to achieve a final product 
having maximum density and performance. One prior art layout of a CMOS
