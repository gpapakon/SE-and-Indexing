<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
electronic apparatuses and more particularly to a heat 
sink structure adapted for mounting upon a substrate of 
an electronic apparatus for cooling the same. With recent developments in high speed 
computers and other electronic processing apparatuses, 
there is a demand for increasing the mounting density 
of module substrates that are used for carrying a 
circuit module. However, such an increased mounting 
density has led to a problem of increased heat 
generation. Therefore, there is an acute demand for a 
more efficient heat sink structure characterized by a 
reduced thermal resistance for heat dissipation, for 
module substrates. Generally, heat sinks of module substrates 
have a size corresponding to the size of the module 
substrate itself and may have a size as large as 70 mm 
for each edge. Such a heat sink having a large size 
and designed for mounting directly upon the module 
substrate, is required to have a small rigidity such 
that the difference in the thermal expansion between 
the heat sink and the substrate is effectively 
absorbed. In recent electronic apparatuses, as a 
result of the increased mounting density of the 
substrates or mother boards within the electronic 
apparatuses, there is a tendency that the substrates 
are disposed with each other with a decreased 
separation. When cooling an electronic apparatus having 
such a structure by air, it is preferable to apply the 
cooling air to flow generally parallel to the  
 
substrates rather than applying the cooling air 
perpendicularly to the substrate. Thereby, one can 
simplify the construction of the apparatus and reduce 
the space needed for cooling. Therefore, it has been desired to provide a 
heat sink that is: (1) applicable to the cooling system 
wherein the cooling air flows parallel to the circuit 
substrate; (2) characterized by a small thermal 
resistance; and (3) characterized by a small rigidity. FIGS.1(A) and 1(B) show an example of a 
conventional heat sink 10 that is disclosed in the 
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 59-202657. Referring to the drawings, the heat sink 10 
includes a number of cooling fin elements 11 connected 
with each other in X- and Y- directions by a base 12 to 
form a matrix, wherein each fin element 11 has a top 
surface formed with a hole 13. Each of the cooling fin elements 11 is formed 
with a cutout 14 that penetrates into the element 11 in 
the X-direction and another cutout 15 that penetrates 
into the element 11 in the Y-direction.
