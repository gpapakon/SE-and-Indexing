<ABSTRACT>
In switching two pictures corresponding to two picture display tasks, 
the former picture display task is permitted to run concurrently with 

the editor picture display task. A drawing command from the former 
picture display task is promptly invalidated. A window of the former 

picture display task is eliminated when the picture is switched, and 
therefore the drawing command from the former picture display task, whose 

window is eliminated, is made invalid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a picture displaying method 
whereby a picture corresponding to a picture display task 
switched among a plurality of the picture display tasks is 
displayed on a displaying device such as a CRT displaying 
one or the like. Generally, a man-machine interface apparatus 6 as 
indicated in a block diagram of Fig. 1 consists of a CRT 
displaying device 1, a frame memory 2 for recording pixel 
information per a dot unit, a drawing controller 3 for drawing 
a picture into the frame memory 2, a microcomputer 4 
incorporated with a multi-task operation system and, a keyboard 
5 for inputting data into the microcomputer 4 therethrough. 
The microcomputer 4 is connected with a controller 
7 which holds the drawing data and controls the microcomputer 
4. Fig. 2 illustrates the constitution of tasks inside the 
microcomputer 4. There are three kinds of picture display 
tasks a,b and c as well as a picture switching control task 
d for controlling the activation and switching of the picture  
 
display tasks a-c. By way of example, if a key A (not 
shown) of the keyboard 5 is depressed, the picture switching 
control task d detects the depression thereby to activate 
the picture display task a. In consequence, the drawing 
controller 3 is turned intelligent, drawing a picture in the 
frame memory 2 on the basis of a drawing command from the 
microcomputer 4 (picture display task a), etc. The result 
is displayed on the CRT displaying device 1. The operation of each picture display task a,b or c is 
shown in a flow chart in Fig. 3, and the procedure for the 
picture display (in the present instance, the picture display 
task a) will now be described with reference to this 
Fig. 3. In the first place, a start demand from the picture 
switching control task d is waited for (step S1). When the 
start demand is extracted from the task d, a window is 
formed (step S2). In forming the window, the drawing area 
in the frame memory 2 is determined. Although it is possible 
to divide the screen into a plurality of sections thereby 
to draw a plurality of pictures simultaneously at one 
time, the whole of the frame memory 2 is rendered one window 
in the present instance for brevity. Moreover, the picture 
display tasks a,b and c are allotted with the window Nos. 
1,2 and 3, respectively. Therefore, a window forming command 
extracted from the picture display task a reads as  
 
"Window forming (command), window No. 1-the drawing area is 
the whole area of the frame memory". Every drawing command

<CLAIMS>
A picture displaying and switching method, for activating 
a picture display task, for extracting a drawing 

command from the activated picture display task and for 
displaying a picture on a displaying device on the basis 

of said drawing command, and for switching a first 
picture display task toa second picture display task 

when said first picture display task is activated, said 
method comprising: 


a first step of activating (S1, S2) a first picture 
display task (b); 
a second step of extracting a drawing command (C1, C2) 
from said first picture display task; 
a third step of displaying (S3 - S6) a picture corresponding 
to said first picture display task on said displaying 

device on the basis of said drawing command; 
a fourth step of responding to a switching command 
(S21, S22, S24) to switch to a second picture display 

task (a) different from said first picture display 
task; and 
a fifth step of displaying (S24, Figure 6) a picture 
corresponding to said second picture display task on 

said displaying device on the basis of the drawing command 
(C5, C7) extracted from said second picture display 

task; 
and characterised in that said fourth step further comprises:  
 
a sixth step of activating said second picture display 
task while said first picture display task is still 

activated; 
a seventh step of extracting drawing commands (C5 - C7) 
from said first picture display task and said second 

picture display task in response to said switching command; 
and 
an eighth step of invalidating (S23, C3, C4) the 
drawing command extracted from said first picture display 

task. 
A picture displaying method as set forth in claim 
1, further comprising: 


a step of adding a signal indicating the display area 
in said displaying device (1) to said drawing command extracted 

from each picture display task; and 
a step of displaying a window corresponding to each 
picture display task on said displaying device on the basis 

of said signal. 
A picture displaying method as set forth in claim 
2, wherein said eighth step includes a step of eliminating 

the window corresponding to said first picture display task (b) 
in response to the command (S23) to switch to said second picture 

display task (a). 
A picture displaying method as set forth in claim 
1, wherein said third and fifth steps include a step of 

collecting drawing data (S4) on the basis of said drawing command, 
a step of storing the collected drawing data temporarily 

into a memory (2), a step of reading out the stored 
drawing data from said memory (2) and a step of displaying a 

picture on said displaying device (1) on the basis of the readout 
drawing data. 
A picture displaying method as as set forth in claim  
 

1, wherein said displaying device is a CRT displaying device (1).
