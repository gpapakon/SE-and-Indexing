<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a piezoelectric motor comprising:   - a stator (1) including piezoelectric means of excitation (E) capable of engendering a vibratory motion of the stator (1), - a rotor (4) mounted rotatably with respect to the stator (1), the said rotor (4) including a body on which are arranged bending lugs (4b) forming means of transmission fashioned so as to transmit the vibrational motion of the stator (1) to the said rotor (4) and so as to drive this rotor in rotation, these bending lugs (4b) travelling over a displacement path (C) relative to the stator (1), and   - a detector (D) of angular position of the rotor.   This motor is characterised in that the said detector (D) is arranged near or in line with the displacement path (C), and in that the said detector is formed by one or more piezoelectric sensors enabling the passing of the said lugs (4b) to be noted. The motor is especially suitable for timepieces.
