<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carbon fiber-reinforced
carbon composite materials, processes for
their production and first walls of nuclear fusion
reactors made of such carbon composite materials.Carbon fiber-reinforced carbon composite materials
(hereinafter referred to simply as C/C composite
materials) are light in weight and highly strong and have
a feature that they are excellent in the heat resistance
and corrosion resistance. Therefore, they are used, for
example, for aerospace materials such as rocket nozzles,
nose cones or disk brakes of air planes, for heater
elements, for hot pressing molds, for other mechanical
parts, and for parts of nuclear reactors
(FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN, vol.9, (1989), pages 295-300).Such C/C composite materials are usually prepared by
impregnating or mixing a matrix material such as a
thermosetting resin such as a phenol resin or a furan
resin, or a thermoplastic resin such as pitch, to long or 
short carbon fibers of e.g. polyacrylonitrile or pitch
type, followed by heating and molding, then baking the
molded product in a non-oxidizing atmosphere such as an
inert gas atmosphere at a temperature of from 600 to
1,000°C, and further densifying the product by
impregnating pitch or a resin thereto, followed by
baking, or by a chemical vapor deposition method, or a
combination of such methods, followed, if necessary, by
graphitization.However, the resulting C/C composite materials were
not necessarily satisfactory when they were used for the
purposes of conducting or removing heat in one direction
i.e. in the thickness direction, and they had problems in
their practical application.For example, a first wall of a nuclear fusion reactor
represents the entire structure in the nuclear fusion
reactor, which is disposed to face the plasma, and
includes e.g. limiters, diverters, blankets, and parts
thereof. Such first wall is disposed close to the plasma
and thus is under a severe environmental condition such
that it is subjected to heat from plasma and bombernment
of plasma particles. Particularly, the limiters and
diverters receive high temperature loads, whereby the
heat load conditions are particularly severe. As one of
materials used for the first wall under such severe
conditions, graphite may be mentioned. Graphite is an
excellent low atomic number material from the viewpoint 
of plasma impurities and also has high thermal shock
resistance.Figure 4 in the drawings illustrates the most typical
conventional first wall wherein graphite is used. In the
