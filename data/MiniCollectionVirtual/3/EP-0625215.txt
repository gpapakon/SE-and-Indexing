<ABSTRACT>
A device for tempering steel tubes comprising an immersion tank (6) for cooling fluid, a chassis (2) for horizontally supporting the tube (5) to be tempered in the tank (6), means for displacing the chassis (2) from a suspended position over the tank to a second position in which the tube is inside the tank, means (3i, 4i) for maintaining the tube on the chassis, so that it does not float and a cooling fluid injection nozzle (1) abuttable against an end of the tube (5) for injecting the cooling fluid into the tube. The invention provides an injection nozzle support actuable (9) for coupling the nozzle (1) to the end of the tube (5) in the suspended position and allowing it to accompany the tube to the second position. The invention further refers to a method for tempering steel tubes, in which dipping in, and injection of cooling fluid are effected in a substantially simultaneous manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to tempering steel 
tubes, which are cooled at a high speed by contact with a 
cooling fluid. More specifically, an injection nozzle is used 
for cooling from the inner surface of the steel tube, which is 
dipped into a tank containing a cooling fluid, for cooling it 
also from its outer surface. In recent years a continuous search for petroleum 
reserves has been effected, especially in deep regions of the 
sea and oceans. With a view to meeting the new requirements 
for the quality of the steel tubes designed for prospection 
and production conditions in these oil fields, methods and 
equipment have been developed for heat treatment of the steel 
tubes employed therein. Most of the tubes to be tempered seek 
to meet the requirements of the API (American Petroleum Institute) 
standards. For certain degrees of quality, these standards 
require the use of a temper system in the process of 
manufacturing steel tubes, among such the following can be 
cited: C75, C90, C95, L80, N80, P105, P110 and Q105. Among 
these standards can be cited API 5 CT (SPEC 5 TC) which refers 
to Casing and Tubing type pipes designed for oil well linings 
and production, and API 5 D referring to Drill Pipe type 
tubes, directed for drilling oil wells. At present there are different methods and devices 
for tempering steel tubes by means of internal and/or external 
cooling, by employing water, air and oil as a cooling fluid, 
among others. Among the principal methods for cooling steel tubes  
 
the following can be cited: 
1- external cooling by means of rings having nozzles 
around the tube; 2- cooling by dipping the tubes into a tank containing 
a cooling medium; 3- internal and external cooling by dipping the 
tubes into a tank containing a cooling fluid and having an injection 
nozzle installed inside the cooling-fluid tank, by rotating 
the steel tube during the process; 4- internal and external cooling by dipping and employing 
an injection nozzle in accordance with the teachings 
of European patent No. EP-A-0086988 to Kruppert Enterprises 
Inc.; 5- internal cooling by means of an injection nozzle 
and external cooling by means of a water curtain upon and 
along the tube, in accordance with the teachings of DE Pat 
3216496 A1.; 6- internal and external cooling by dipping and employing 
a replaceable injection nozzle matched with the size 
of the tube in accordance with the teachings of EP-A-0 172 250. In the case of cooling steel tubes having a thick 
wall according to method (1) it is
