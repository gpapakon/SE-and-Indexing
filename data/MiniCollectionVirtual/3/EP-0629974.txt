<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an non-impact printer
incorporating a linear array of recording sources. More
in particular, the invention relates to the correction of
undesired unevenness of the optical density of the
produced images.Examples of non-impact printers include, but are not
restricted to include only, (i) recording sources such as
light emitting diodes (LEDs), ion deposition control
electrodes, (ii) receptor means such as organic
photoconductive (OPC) drums, capacitive drums, (iii)
developing means such as dry or liquid toner development
units and (iv) transfer means such as electrostatic
transfer systems.In a printer wherein LEDs are used as recording sources,
the linear lens used with said LED-based printer is
considered to be fictively divided into as many partial
lenses as there are recording sources, each of said
partial lenses being considered a part of a single
recording source. As such, when describing a linear
array of LEDs, a recording source comprises (i) a LED,
(ii) a current source driving the LED and (iii) the
portion of the lens responsible for projecting the light
of the respective LED onto the receptor surface. In
general, said recording source comprises the
spot-specific electrical, mechanical and/or optical means
needed to produce a single spot on a receptor surface. In many existing non-impact printers an image is built by
repetitively producing lines of spots, each spot being
formed by means of one of a number of recording sources
forming a linear array of said recording sources. Each
of said recording sources delivers a controlled amount of
energy to a receptor surface in order to form a latent
image on said receptor surface. Also, said non-impact
printers comprise means for developing said latent images
and transferring the developed images to the output
medium, being paper or the like.In such printers, multiple gradation levels of the
optical density of each spot constituting an image to be
printed are obtained by providing multiple energy levels
for each spot, and as energy equals power times time,
each of the recording sources is typically driven with a
constant output power level, for a period of time
proportional to the gradation value of the respective
spot. This approach is much easier to implement than the
approach wherein the multiple energy levels are obtained
by providing multiple levels of output power for a
constant period of time. In printers where the recording
sources comprise LEDs for example, multiple optical
energy levels are obtained by driving
