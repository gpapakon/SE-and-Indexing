<ABSTRACT>
Known antennas of which the conductors are about a quarter wavelength 
long of the waves to be transmitted and/or received by the antenna take up rather much 

space. The antenna (1) according to the invention comprises a first conductor (2) folded 
in a plurality of loops (3) which at least partly overlap, seen in a first direction (z). As 

a result, the antenna (1) seen in the first direction (z) is more compact than quarter 
wavelength antennas known thus far and are therefore highly suitable for incorporation 

in the housing of, for example, a cordless telephone. 
The invention further relates to a cordless telecommunication apparatus 
comprising such an antenna (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an antenna, comprising a first conductor having a
length of substantially a quarter wavelength of electromagnetic waves to be transmitted and/or
received by the antenna.The invention further relates to a cordless telecommunication apparatus
comprising an antenna, which antenna includes a first conductor having a length of
substantially a quarter wavelength of electromagnetic waves to be transmitted and/or received
by the antenna. A cordless telecommunication apparatus is understood to mean, for example,
telecommunication apparatus exchanging information by means of radio links. Such cordless
telecommunication apparatuses are, for example, a telephone operating according to the CT1
standard or a pager.Known quarter wavelength antennas are the antennas used in cordless
telephones manufactured by Hagenuk operating around 900 MHz. They consist of a PCB
(Printed Circuit Board) on which a conductor functioning as an antenna is realised. The
conductor consists of sections positioned in a first direction, connected to each other by means
of sections positioned substantially perpendicular to the first direction. As a result, an antenna
structure is obtained taking up rather much space in the first direction. Especially if such an
antenna is to be accommodated in the housing of a cordless telephone or pager this is a
drawback, because in view of the ever continuing miniaturisation of such equipment it is
desirable to keep the space to be used by the antenna smallest possible. A compact antenna in the form of a substantially quarter wavelength meander wire
stretching out from a feed point, possibly in dual symmetric form, is disclosed in
US 4 860 020. It is an object of the invention to provide an antenna of the type defined in the
opening paragraph, which is more compact than the antenna already known.An antenna according to the invention is characterized in that the first
conductor comprises a plurality of distinct loops lying in a single plane stretching out in a first
direction seen from an antenna base, said loops overlapping each other at least partly. As a
result, the antenna is more compact in the first direction than the antenna already known, so
that less space for an antenna is needed in the housing of a cordless telephone or a pager.
Measurements have shown that the performance of the antenna according to the invention is
equivalent to that of the Hagenuk antenna. Furthermore, the antenna is rather insensitive to
minor 
dimensional modifications. This leads to the fact that the
