<ABSTRACT>
In a process for synthesising and exploring unknown chemical compounds, substances are randomly synthesised. For that purpose, mixtures composed of combined known pure substances are subjected to reaction-inducing chemical and/or physical conditions. The large number of thus obtained unpredictable products are examined by selective biotests for positively-reacting components, which are isolated, represented in their pure form and subjected to a chemophysical exploration of their structure. A comparison with external data banks indicates whether the discovered chemical structures were previously unknown.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the random generation and testing of chemical compounds by means of the
following method steps:


Combinatorial production of mixtures from known, soluble educts;
exposure of mixtures to radiation, such that the known educts react to become product
cocktails of unpredictable composition;
testing of the product cocktails in specific biological test systems for specific biological
activities;
separation of the product cocktails showing activity by means of non-destructive methods
and testing of the individual fractions concerning biological activity.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
, the structure of the isolated components
is determined.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the exposure to radiation is effected
by means of an ionizing radiation or neutron bombardment.
