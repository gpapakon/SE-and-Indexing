<ABSTRACT>
An image detection device, notably a semiconductor image detection array 
for detecting x-ray images, is provided wherein perturbations due to 

phantom-images 
are substantially mitigated. In such an image detection array incident 

image carrying 
radiation is converted into charges. Delayed charge transfer due to 

trapping of charges 
in the semiconductor material of radiation sensor elements causes such perturbations. 

In 
an image detection device according to the invention a correction circuit is provided 

which is arranged to form an image correction signal being representative of delayed 
transferred charges. In a particular embodiment of a image detection device according 

to the invention the image correction signal is assembled as a superposition of 
exponentially decaying signals of images which were detected before the detection 

of a 
currently detected image. An image signal containing artifacts due to delayed charge 

transfer is formed by a read-out circuit whereto charges formed by the radiation 
sensor 

elements are transferred. A corrected image signal is subsequently assembled 
from the 

image correction signal and said image signal containing artifacts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image detection device comprising an image
detection array which incorporates radiation sensitive elements to convert incident
radiation into charges, and read-out-lines to transfer said charges to a read-out circuit
which is arranged to convert transferred charges into a primary electronic image signal.
The invention also relates to an x-ray examination apparatus provided with an image
detection array.An image detection array of said kind has been described in the European
Patent Application EP 0 440 282. In the cited reference an image detection array is described which is in
particular intended for use in an x-ray examination apparatus. X-ray examination is
performed by irradiating a patient with an x-ray beam, so that an x-ray image is formed
on an x-ray detector. The x-ray detector of the x-ray examination apparatus of the cited
reference has the form of an image detection array. The x-ray image can either be
converted into charges by the radiation sensitive semiconductor elements, or the x-radiation
which is incident on the x-ray detector can be first converted by a scintillator
layer e.g. a CsI:Tl layer into electromagnetic radiation of a longer wavelength, notably
in the region between ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Next, the radiation produced by
the scintillator layer is converted into charges by the semiconductor elements. The
semiconductor elements may consist e.g. of α-Si:H, α-Se, or α-Se:As which are
sensitive to x-radiation, or α-Si:H semiconductor elements covered by a CsI:Tl layer
can be employed. The radiation sensitive elements of the array are arranged in rows and
columns, so that the image detection array is shaped as an image detection matrix. The
charges are read-out by way of read lines under control of a row-driver circuit which
controls switching elements e.g. having the form of thin-film field effect transistors
which are provided for each of the radiation sensitive elements. The read lines transfer
the charges to a read-out circuit which forms a primary electronic image signal from the 
transferred charges. The primary electronic image signal is employed to display the
image which is detected by the x-ray detector on a monitor, store the image information
in an image memory or make a hard-copy of the image.In the primary electronic image signal formed by an image detection array
of the cited reference, artifacts due to memory effects can occur, adversely affecting the
diagnostic quality of the stored and/or displayed images. Such artifacts
