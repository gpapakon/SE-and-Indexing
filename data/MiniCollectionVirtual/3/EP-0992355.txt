<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning fluid for use with an inkjet printer having orifices (9) for
ejecting ink, the surface of the orifices at the ejection point being formed by a

predetermined material includes a liquid for cleaning the orifice surface; and an
additive (100) in the liquid having a strong affinity for the material which forms the

orifice surface and coats such surface to form a protective coating of such additive
so that if a portion of the protective coating is removed, such portion will be

repaired by the additive material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inkjet printing and, more particularly, to a
cleaning fluid for cleaning an inkjet printing head with a hydrodynamic cleaning
apparatus and applying a protective layer to the surface of the printhead.Inkjet printing is a non-impact method for producing images by the
deposition of ink droplets on a substrate (paper, transparent film, fabric, etc.) in
response to digital signals. Inkjet printers have found broad applications across
markets ranging from industrial labeling to short run printing to desktop document
and pictorial imaging. In recent years the drop size of inkjet printers has tended to
become smaller and smaller, resulting in higher resolution and higher quality
prints. The smaller drop size is accompanied by smaller nozzle openings in the
inkjet printhead. These smaller nozzle openings are easier to plug and more
sensitive to extraneous deposits which can affect both the size and placement
accuracy of the inkjet drop.It has been recognized that there is a need to maintain the ink
ejecting nozzles of an inkjet printhead, for example, by periodically cleaning the
orifices when the printhead is in use, and/or by capping the printhead when the
printer is out of use or is idle for extended periods of time. The capping of the
printhead is intended to prevent the ink in the printhead from drying out. There is
also a need to prime a printhead before use, to insure that the printhead channels
are completely filled with ink and contain no contaminants or air bubbles and also
periodically to maintain proper functioning of the orifices. Maintenance and/or
priming stations for the printheads of various types of inkjet printers are described
in, for example, US-A-4,855,764; US-A-4,853,717; and US-A-4,746,938.
Removal of gas from the ink reservoir of a printhead during printing is described
in US-A-4,679,059. In US-A-4,306,245 a liquid jet recording device provided
with a cleaning protective means for cleaning and protecting an orifice is
described. The cleaning protective means is provided at a reset position lying at
one end of the scanning shaft of the device.US-A-5,128,690 describes an inkjet apparatus comprising an inkjet
head having plural discharge openings for discharging ink. A partial cap member, 
which can cover at least one of the discharge openings, is connected to a pressure
source that can supply sufficient pressure through the covered discharge openings
to force any foreign matter into a common liquid chamber. A liquid flow is created
in the common chamber to flush

<CLAIMS>
A cleaning fluid for use with an inkjet printer having
orifices for ejecting ink, the surface of the orifices at the ejection point being

formed by a predetermined material, comprising:

a) a liquid for cleaning the orifice surface; and
b) an additive in the liquid having a strong affinity for the
material which forms the orifice surface and coats such surface to form a

protective coating of such additive so that if a portion of the protective coating is
removed, such portion will be repaired by the additive material.
The cleaning fluid of claim 1 wherein the material includes
a hydrophobic additive in cleaning fluid.
The cleaning fluid of claim 1 wherein the hydrophobic
additive is an alkane thiol.
The cleaning fluid of claim 1 wherein the ink has a
hydrophilic additive.
The cleaning fluid of claim 4 wherein the hydrophilic
additive is selected from the group consisting of mercaptopropyltrihydroxysilane

for a neutral hydrophilic surface, a thioalkylsurfonic acid for an anionic
hydrophilic surface, and a thioalkyltrimethylammonium salt for a cationic

hydrophilic surface.
An inkjet printhead including a structure defining:

a) a plurality of orifices for ejecting ink droplets;
b) means defining a pumping cavity in communication with
the orifices for receiving ink and formed, at least in part, of a piezo electric

material which, when energized, squeezes the chamber to eject ink through the
orifice, the ink including a hydrophilic additive with respect to the piezo electric

material; and
c) a cleaning station including means for applying a cleaning
liquid to clean the orifices, such cleaning liquid including an additive in the liquid

having a strong affinity for the material which forms the orifice surface and coats
such surface to form a protective coating of such additive so that if a portion of the

protective coating is removed, such portion will be repaired by the additive
material.
