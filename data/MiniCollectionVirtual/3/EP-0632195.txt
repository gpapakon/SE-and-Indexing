<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to sealing two housing parts (2, 3) by means of an elastomer seal (5), which has elastic elements (9) on the outer circumference, which can be inserted into through-bores (11) by folding over. In this way a placement of the housing part (2) against the housing part (3) is created which is insulated against structure-borne noise.

<CLAIMS>
Sealing arrangement of adjoining sealing surfaces of an oil tank and a crankshaft 
casing in internal combustion engines using an elastomer seal, which may be 

clamped between the two housing parts via fastening screws, said fastening screws 
being arranged in continuous holes in the oil tank by elastic elements so as to be 

insulated against solid-borne noise from the oil tank, characterised in that the 
elastic elements (9) extend on the outer periphery of the elastomer seal (5) and may 

be attached onto or inserted into the continuous holes (11) by folding them over. 
Sealing arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the elastic elements 
(9) are connected in one piece to the elastomer seal (5). 
Sealing arrangement according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that elastic 
elements (9) distributed over the periphery of the elastomer seal (5) are arranged 

with different axial height. 
Sealing arrangement according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that spacer 
sleeves (11) are arranged in the holes of the elastic elements (9). 
Device according to Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the spacer sleeves (11) 
have a retaining means (12) in the end region. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the retaining means (12) is 
constructed as a radially projecting collar. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the retaining means (12) is 
constructed as an undercut. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the spacer sleeve (11) is 
made of metal.
