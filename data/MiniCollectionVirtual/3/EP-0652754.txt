<ABSTRACT>
A topical drug application for the alleviation of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) is comprised of a solution of sex steroids or their derivatives suspended or dissolved in a vehicle, and the method of preparation and application of the same. In the preferred embodiments, the sex steroid consists essentially of conjugated estrogen in a lipid vehicle or a derivative of estrogen known as 17 beta-Estradiol 3-phosphate disodium dissolved in an aqueous vehicle having a pH of between 6 and 8.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drugs for the topical application
of sex steroids in the treatment of human dry eye syndrome
(keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and, more specifically, to the
preparation and application of estrogen and its derivatives in
lipid or aqueous vehicles for the topical treatment of the ocular
surface tissues.In the specification and claims hereinafter the term 'sex
steroids' is defined to include estrogen, progesterone,
testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and chemical variants and
derivatives of the same.The high incidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca in the
population of postmenopausal women is attended by symptoms
ranging from mild foreign body sensation to frank pain and visual
loss due to ocular surface abnormalities.The standard treatment with artificial lubricants, which
provides temporary symptomatic relief in most cases does not,
however, address the cause of the dry eyes. While Fried and
deRoetth have anecdotally described treatment of post menopausal
females with dry eye syndrome using oral premarin therapy, the
oral or parenteral administration of estrogen frequently produces
vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness and other undesired effects.
Further, such oral or parenteral administration implicates the
entire body structure in an indeterminate effort to secure an
effect in a localized area (the eye), in the absence of any data
relating the level of estrogen introduced into the blood stream
to the level, if any, resulting in the tear fluid. Conservative
medicine would indicate the desirability of limiting the specific
effect of the hormone to the recipient site if possible.Although many enzymes, hormones and metabolites are known
to be present in human tear film, there was no data showing that
estrogen was or should be present in the tear fluid of normal 
persons. Further, there was no data correlating the dosage of
orally or parenterally administered estrogen to the level, if
any, of estrogen resulting in the tear fluid. Inasmuch as no
significant direct evidence of estrogenic control of lacrimal
function exists in the literature, both human studies and animal
model were undertaken to determine the role of estrogen
metabolism, if any, in dry eye syndrome.The first series of experiments determined that sex
steroids, namely estrogen and testosterone, are present in human
tear film. Testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol levels were
determined for blood serum, saliva, and tears by
radioimmunoassay. Estradiol levels in the lacrimal and salivary
secretions were found to range between 2
