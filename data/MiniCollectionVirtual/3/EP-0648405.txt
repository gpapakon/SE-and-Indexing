<ABSTRACT>
Flat circuit units (10) with electronic components which are irreversibly and/or reversibly alterable in relation to component-specific circuit variables are automatically functionally aligned in that the "irreversible" electronic components are altered using scanned local co-ordinates directly by a laser (130) and the "reversible" electronic components are altered using scanned local co-ordinates indirectly with an adjusting device (134), in relation to the component-specific circuit variables.

Arrangement for the functional trimming of flat 
circuit units, having a positioning device (131, 133), 

which on the basis of predetermined position data of 
electronic components of the flat circuit unit (10) 

arranged in a receptacle (131) pre-positions the components 
for a scanning, having a scanning device (130), 

which determines local coordinates of the electronic 
components by scanning, having a measuring/evaluating 

device (132), which carries out circuit function measurements 
of the flat circuit unit (10) arranged in the 

receptacle (131) and having an operating device (130, 
134), which in dependence on the circuit function measurements 

operates on the electronic components to alter 
component-specific circuit variables of the circuit 

functions, characterized in that a single laser is 
provided, which undertakes both the scanning and the 

operating on the electronic components. 
Arrangement according to the precharacterizing 
clause of Claim 1, characterized in that 


a) the scanning device (130) is designed as a laser 
which determines the local coordinates of further electronic 

components which can be reversibly altered in 
relation to the component-specific circuit varia
bles and 
b) an adjusting device (134) is provided, which with 
the aid of these determined local coordinates alters the 

component-specific circuit variables by setting procedures 
on the components. 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the electronic components which can be reversibly 

altered in relation to the component-specific circuit  
 

variables are designed as variable capacitors and/or 
potentiometers. 
Arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the adjusting device (134) is designed as a screwdriver. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the flat circuit units (10) contain 

high-frequency circuits for telephone sets. 
Process for the functional trimming of flat circuit 
units, in which electronic components of the flat circuit 

unit (10) are pre-positioned for a scanning, in which 
local coordinates of the electronic components are 

determined by scanning, in which circuit function measurements 
are carried out on the flat circuit unit (10) 

and in which, in dependence on the circuit function 
measurements, the electronic components are operated on 

to alter component-specific circuit variables of the 
circuit functions, characterized in that the determination 

of the local coordinates of the electronic 
components and the operating on the electronic components 

for altering the component-specific circuit variables of 
the circuit functions in dependence on the circuit 

function measurements are performed by a single laser. 
Process according to the precharacterizing clause of 
Patent Claim 6, characterized in that a laser determines 

the local coordinates of further electronic components 
which can be reversibly altered in relation to the 

component-specific circuit variables and, on the basis of 
the local coordinates determined, an adjusting device 

(134) alters the component-specific circuit variables by 
setting procedures on the components.
