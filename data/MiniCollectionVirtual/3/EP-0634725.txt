<CLAIMS>
Processor node comprising processors (8), a shared
local memory (11) and at least one local bus (10) ensuring

a parallel link between the processors (8), characterised
in that it comprises:


a shared local cache (12), the local bus (10)
providing a parallel link between the processors (8), the

shared local memory (11) and the shared local cache (12),
the local bus being used only for the transmission of

messages that are of direct use to the processors,
means for linking said node to at least one
other node or, where appropriate, to an input/output

member (6),
at least one network bus (13) providing a
parallel link between the shared local memory (11), the

shared local cache (12) and said linking means and also,
where appropriate, to at least one input/output member

(6), the network bus being used for the transmission of
linking messages between nodes.
Processor node according to Claim 1, characterised in
that said linking means comprise at least one serial link

controller (14) connected to the network bus and ensuring
the relationship with at least one other node or, where

appropriate, with an input/output member.
Processor node according to Claim 1, characterised in
that it comprises two local buses (10.111, 10.112) each

associated with the processors (8), with a shared local
cache (12.111, 12.112) and with a shared local memory

(11.111, 11.112), and two network buses (13.111, 13.112)
also each associated with a shared local cache (12.111,

12.112) and with a shared local memory (11.111, 11.112). 
Processor node according to Claims 2 and 3,
characterised in that the two network buses (13.111,

13.112) are each associated with each serial link
controller (14).
Processor node according to Claim 1, characterised in
that it comprises a private cache (9) associated with each

processor and arranged between the processor and the local
bus (10).
Processor node according to Claims 3 and 5,
characterised in that it comprises two interfaces (15)

each associated with two private caches (9.1111, 9.1112)
and with a local bus (10.111, 10.112).
Processor node according to one of Claims 1, 5 or 6,
characterised in that it comprises two series of

processors (8.11-8.14, 8.21-8.24) each associated with a
local bus (10.1, 10.2) and with a shared local memory

(11.1, 11.2), and a network bus (13) common to two series
of processors.
Shared-memory processing system comprising at least
two processor nodes according to one of Claims 1 to 7.
