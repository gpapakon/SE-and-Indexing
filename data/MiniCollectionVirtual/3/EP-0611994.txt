<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for making a low volume 
photographic material processing apparatus employing a 

rack (11) and a tank (12) out of an existing larger volume 
photographic processing apparatus. The converted 

photographic processing apparatus will contain a 
smaller volume of the same photographic solution that 

was previously used in non-converted processing tanks.

Reference is made to commonly assigned
copending patent applications: Serial No. 844,820
entitled "A DRIVING MECHANISM FOR A PHOTOGRAPHIC
PROCESSING APPARATUS" filed March 2, 1992 in the names
of Ralph L. Piccinino, Jr., David L. Patton, Roger E.
Bartell, Anthony Earle, and John Rosenburgh, Serial No.
844,343 entitled "ANTI-WEB ADHERING CONTOUR SURFACE FOR
A PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESSING APPARATUS" filed March 2,

David L. Patton, Serial No. 844,355 entitled "A SLOT
IMPINGEMENT FOR A PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESSING APPARATUS"
filed March 2, 1992 in the names of John Rosenburgh,
David L. Patton, Ralph L. Piccinino, Jr., and Anthony
Earle, Serial No. 844,815 entitled "A RACK AND A TANK
FOR A PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESSING APPARATUS" filed March 2,
1992 in the names of David L. Patton, Roger E. Bartell,
John H. Rosenburgh and Ralph L. Piccinino, Jr. and
Serial No. 855,806 entitled "RECIRCULATION,
REPLENISHMENT, REFRESH, RECHARGE AND BACKFLUSH FOR A
PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESSING APPARATUS" filed March 2, 1992
in the names of Roger E. Bartell, David L. Patton, John
Rosenburgh, and Ralph L. Piccinino, Jr.The invention relates to the field of
photography, and particularly to a photosensitive
material processing apparatus.The processing of photographic film involves
a series of steps such as developing, bleaching,
fixing, washing, and drying. These steps lend 
themselves to mechanization by conveying a continuous
web of film or cut sheets of film or photographic paper
sequentially through a series of stations or tanks,
each one containing a different processing liquid
appropriate to the process step at that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, employing a rack and a tank,
i.e., large photofinishing apparatus and microlabs. A
large photofinishing apparatus utilizes tanks that
contain approximately 100 liters of each processing
solution. A small photofinishing apparatus or microlab
utilizes tanks that may contain less than 10 liters of
processing solution.The chemicals contained in the photographic
solution: cost money to purchase; change in activity
and leach out or season during the photographic
process; and after the chemicals are used the chemicals
must be disposed of in an environmentally safe manner.
Thus, it is important in all sizes of photofinishing
apparatus to reduce the volume of processing solution.
The prior art suggest various types of replenishing
systems that add or subtract specific
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A kit for reducing the volume of a tank (12;12A) and rack (11;11A) arrangement which
contains a processing solution in an apparatus for processing photosensitive

material (33), the kit comprising:

a pair of first inserts (50,60;50A,60A) arranged to be placed adjacent opposite side
walls (44,45;62,63) of the tank, wherein the rack is placed between the pair of

first inserts; and
a second insert (2,3;2A,3A) placed within the rack, said pair of first inserts and
said second insert being dimensioned with respect to said rack and tank so that a low

volume thin processing chamber (10;10A) is provided between said first and
second inserts and said rack.
The kit according to Claim 1, wherein at least one slot nozzle (38-41;38A-C
to 41A-C) is provided in at least one of said pair of first inserts, said rack or said

second insert for providing imaging processing solution against the photosensitive
material so as to disrupt an exhaustive processing solution on a surface of the

photosensitive material.
A kit for reducing the volume of a tank (12;12A) for containing processing solution in an
apparatus for processing photosensitive material (33), the kit comprising a pair of

inserts (50,60;50A,60A) arranged to be placed adjacent opposite side walls of the tank
and a rack (11;11A) arranged to be placed between the inserts, said inserts and said rack

being dimensioned with respect to said tank so that a low volume thin processing chamber (10;10A) is
provided between said inserts and rack, said rack containing fluid displacing

means (2,3;2A,3A) to displace sufficient processing solution so that a small low
volume for holding moving processing solution and photosensitive material is

formed between the rack and said inserts; and at least one slot nozzle (38-41;38A-C
to 41A-C) is also provided in at least one of said rack or said inserts for

providing impinging processing solution against the photosensitive material so as
to disrupt the exhaustive processing solution on the surface of the photosensitive

material.
