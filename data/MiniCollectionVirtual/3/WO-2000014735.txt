<ABSTRACT>
An optical information recording medium comprising a substrate and a phase-change recording layer including a crystal portion, which is brought into an unrecorded/erased state, and an amorphous portion, which is brought into a recorded state, for recording information by using recording marks whose shortest mark length is 0.5  mu m or less, is characterized in that erasure is effected by recrystalization substantially progressed by the growth of crystals from the boundary between the amorphous portion or a fusible portion and the peripheral crystal portion.  The medium has a feature that high-speed overwrite is possible, the jitters at the mark edges are small, high-density variable mark-length recording is possible, and the stability of the marks with time is very good. An optical recording method suitable for such a medium is also disclosed.
