<ABSTRACT>
A tapping attachment for use in connection with radial tapping 
comprises a tap spindle member (34) rotatable in a tapping direction, a 

driven part (20) engageable with a driving (16) part from a power source 
in a different direction from the tapping direction, a forward drive 

member (28) engageable with the tap spindle member (34) to drive the tap 
spindle member in the tapping direction, a reverse drive member (30) 

engageable with the tap spindle (34) to drive it in a direction opposite to 
the tapping direction, means (24,26) for transmitting drive to the forward 

drive member (28) and the reverse drive member (30) and engageable 
with the driven part (30) for receiving drive and with the tap spindle 

member. The forward drive member (28) and the reverse drive member 
(30) are moveable axially along the tapping direction relative to the tap 

spindle member (34) and upon relative axial movement in a direction 
opposite to the tapping direction, the forward drive member disengages 

from the tap spindle member and the reverse drive member engages in 
driving engagement with the tap spindle member to impart reverse rotation 

to the tap spindle member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is that of tapping
attachments for providing tapping in a radial direction,
that is in a direction different from that of a driver
member from a driving machine. In particular, the invention
relates to radial tapping attachments which are
self-reversing.The field of the invention and prior art patents
are exemplified in the field of self-reversing tapping
attachments by reference to prior patents of the inventor of
the invention of the instant application. These include
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,999,642, 4,014,421, 4,705,437,
European Patent Application Serial No. 0 520 771, and
patents cited therein.The aforesaid patents disclose and claim
self-reversing tapping attachments including a tap-holding
spindle together with simultaneously rotating forward and
reverse drivers, the spindle being freely floating and
moveable axially with respect to the forward and reverse
drivers. Under the influence of the forward driver, the tap
in effect screws itself into the hole being tapped in the
workpiece. Upon cessation of feed by the tapping machine
and retraction of the tapping machine, causing relative
axial movement between the tap holding spindle and the
driver members, the forward drive member becomes disengaged
from the tap spindle. Upon further retractive movement by 
the tapping machine, additional relative movement occurs
whereby the reverse drive member becomes engaged with the
tapping spindle, causing reverse rotation of the tap spindle
and unscrewing the tap from the hole. In this manner,
self-reversing is accomplished.US 5 143 161 discloses a self-reversing tapping attachment for
effecting radial tapping with such a type of self reversing arrangement. The
device comprises:
a) a driven part engageable with a driving part directed in a first
direction from a power source;b) gear means engageable with said driven part for transmitting rotary
drive from said driven part in a perpendicular direction, the gear means
being engageable with a forward drive coupling gear on a vertical shaft
and a reverse drive coupling gear on the vertical shaft;c) a forward drive coupling gear engageable in driving engagement
with said gear means;d) a reverse drive coupling gear engageable in driving engagement
with said gear means;e) a tap spindle member including a tap holder for holding a tap, said
tap spindle member being rotatable in a tapping direction different from
said first direction, said tap spindle member being engageable with said
forward drive coupling gear for forward rotation to produce

A self-reversing tapping attachment (10) for radial tapping
comprising:


(a) a driven part (20) engageable with a driving part (16)
directed in a first direction from a power source;
(b) gear means (24,26) engageable with said driven part (20)
for transmitting rotary drive from said driven part to a forward drive

member and a reverse drive member;
(c) a forward drive member (28) engageable in driving
engagement with said gear means (24);
(d) a reverse drive member (30) engageable in driving
engagement with said gear means (26);
(e) a tap spindle member (34) including a tap holder (38) for
holding a
 tap (40), said tap spindle member (34) being rotatable in a
tapping direction different from said first direction, said tap spindle

member (34) being engageable with said forward drive member (28) for
forward rotation to produce tapping in said tapping direction, said

reverse drive member (30) being engageable with said tap spindle
member (34) for producing reverse rotation of said tap spindle member

(34) said tap spindle member (34) being moveable in said tapping
direction and in a reverse tapping direction opposite to said tapping

direction relative to said forward drive member (28) and said reverse
drive member (30) such that said tap spindle member (34) is

disengageable from said forward drive member (28) upon relative
movement of said forward drive member (28) said reverse tapping

direction.
The self-reversing tapping attachment as set forth in claim 1 wherein said tap spindle
member (34) is engageable with said reverse drive member (30) to 

rotate said tap spindle (34) in the reverse tapping direction upon relative
movement between said tap spindle member (34) and said reverse drive

member (30) in the reverse tapping direction.
The self-reversing tapping attachment as set forth in claim 2 wherein said forward drive
member (28) is disposed forwardly in said tapping direction from said

reverse drive member (30).
The self-reversing tapping attachment as set forth in claim 2 wherein said tap spindle
member (34) and said forward drive member (28) are biased to engage

one another in driving engagement.
The self-reversing tapping attachment as set forth in claim 2 wherein said gear means
(24,26) is engageable with said reverse drive member (30) and said

forward drive member (28) to impart rotation thereto substantially
