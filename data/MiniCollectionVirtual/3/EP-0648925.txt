<ABSTRACT>
An exhaust gas recirculation control system for 
an internal combustion engine includes an exhaust gas 

recirculation passage extending between the intake 
system of the engine and the exhaust system thereof, 

and an exhaust gas recirculation control valve for 
controlling the flow rate of exhaust gases to be 

recirculated through the exhaust gas recirculation 
passage. The system further includes an ECU which 

calculates a desired air-fuel ratio of a mixture 
supplied to the engine, based on engine operating 

conditions detected by engine operating parameter 
sensors, and also a desired valve opening of the 

exhaust gas recirculation control valve, based on 

engine operating conditions detected by the operating 
parameter sensors and the calculated desired air-fuel 

ratio. The ECU modifies the calculated desired valve 
opening by a first predetermined amount, and starts the 

controlling of the flow rate of exhaust gases to be 
recirculated by the exhaust gas recirculation control 

valve, by the use of the modified desired valve 
opening, when it is determined that the desired air-fuel 

ratio has been changed from a lean state to a rich 
state or vice versa.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an exhaust gas recirculation 
control system for internal combustion engines, and more 
particularly to an exhaust gas recirculation control system 
which recirculates part of exhaust gases emitted from the 
engine to the intake system thereof, to thereby decrease 
emission of noxious components in the exhaust gases, such as 
NOx. In prior art, a method of controlling exhaust gas 
recirculation has been proposed, for example, by Japanese 
Provisional Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 60-173361, which 
method comprises providing an exhaust gas recirculation 
passage for recirculating part of exhaust gases emitted from 
an internal combustion engine to the intake system thereof, 
and an exhaust gas recirculation valve for controlling the 
flow rate of exhaust gases to be recirculated through the 
exhaust gas recirculation passage, and calculating a desired 
amount of exhaust gases to be recirculated in response to 
the air-fuel ratio of a mixture supplied to the engine, to 
thereby control the exhaust gas recirculation valve, based 
on the calculated desired amount of exhaust gases to be 
recirculated. The above conventional method, however, has the following 
disadvantage: For example, when the air-fuel ratio of the 
mixture has been changed from a rich state to a lean state, 
NOx is emitted in large amounts.  
 To reduce the emission of NOx, a large amount of 
exhaust gases should be supplied by recirculation to 
the engine. However, the method does not contemplate a 
so-called "dynamic delay" of exhaust gases to be 
recirculated, which is a time lag from the time the 
amount of exhaust gases to be recirculated is 
calculated to the time the calculated amount of exhaust 
gases is actually supplied to the engine. Therefore, 
the desired amount of exhaust gases to be recirculated 
is not supplied to the engine immediately after the 
above change in the air-fuel ratio, resulting in 
failure to reduce the amount of NOx to a satisfactory 
degree immediately after the change. It is the object of the invention to provide an 
exhaust gas recirculation control system for internal 
combustion engines, which is capable of restraining 
emission of noxious components such as NOx to amounts 
as small as possible, even immediately after a change 
in the air-fuel ratio of the mixture from a lean state 
to a rich state or vice versa. To attain the above object, the present 
invention provides an exhaust gas recirculation control 
system for an internal combustion engine having an 
intake system,
