<ABSTRACT>
An instrument and related process for measuring color, shade, gloss, shape and/or translucence of a tooth. First, the instrument uses searchlight illumination to illuminate a tooth with constant irradiance. Second, the instrument uses colorimetric imaging to collect time-separated frames of different wavelengths of light reflected from a tooth and to combine those frames into a color image. Third, the instrument includes a sanitary shield to establish a reference color and a predetermined distance to a target tooth. Fourth, the instrument provides line-of-sight viewing so an operator may simultaneously view a display of the image on the instrument and the object being measured. Fifth, the instrument is impervious to pollutants because it incorporates a sealed measurement window. Sixth, optical measurements of a tooth taken by a dentist are compared to optical measurements of a prosthetic restoration for that tooth to confirm satisfactory matching of optical characteristics of the tooth and restoration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shield for instruments for measuring optical
characteristics--for example color, translucency, and/or gloss--of objects and, more
particularly, to such instruments for use in dental applications.
A shield according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed
in WO-A-97/25913.The determination of shade or color of an object is a process that is frequently
performed in the field of dentistry. To perform dental restorations of a damaged tooth, a
dentist visually compares the color of the tooth to be replaced with an assortment of shade
tabs. These shade tabs are physical tabs representing the color of commercially available
restorative material, such as ceramics. The tabs include the exact specification of materials
needed to produce a restorative tooth with the shade of the original tooth as determined by
the dentist's visual comparison. Once the dentist finds a shade tab that matches the color of
the tooth, or remaining adjacent teeth in some cases, he is in a position to manufacture the
required restoration. This process, however, is very time consuming and quite subjective,
and frequently results in poorly shaded restorations.In the field of dentistry, intraoral cameras are frequently used to acquire
images of teeth and determine treatment plans for cavities and other mechanical
reconstruction. These cameras are designed to be versatile and able to collect measurements
in tight places often found in the mouth: however, they do not preserve the color fidelity--that
is, they do not collect the true color--of the object measured.Some dentists attempt to use intraoral cameras to assist in the shade
determination process. Unfortunately, conventional intraoral cameras suffer two problems:
distance sensitivity due to illumination geometry and color discrimination error due to sensor
limitations. With regard to the first problem, intraoral cameras typically use fiberoptic
illumination to reduce the size of the handpiece. Such a device is disclosed in U.S. Re.
36.434 to Hamlin et al. reissued December 7.1999. The goal of Hamlin, and most intraoral
cameras, is to provide a small measuring tip on a handpiece that can be used to probe hard to
reach areas in a mouth. Although fiber-optic illumination is useful for providing high levels
of illumination and is compatible with small measuring probe tips, a drawback of any small
illumination source that illuminates a larger area is that the projected beam must be divergent
light. The intensity of a divergent beam is governed by the

<CLAIMS>
A shield (300) for a device (10) used to measure the colour of dental
objects within a field of view comprising a one-piece integral body defining a

cavity through which illumination passes, said body being of a predetermined
length, said body including means (324) for attaching said body to an

instrument, 
characterised in that
 said body includes an illumination reference
area (330) in the field of view (350) when, in operation, the device collects an image of an object.
A shield as claimed in claim 1 wherein said attaching means comprises
means for releasably securing said body to the colour measuring device.
A shield as claimed in claim 2 wherein said body is disposable.
A shield as claimed in claim 3 wherein said body is opaque to prevent
ambient light from entering said cavity.
A shield as claimed in claim 4 comprising indicia means (340) for
providing information captured in the field of view.
A shield as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the body includes first
(310) and second (322) ends said first end separated from said second end a pre-selected

distance, the first end defining a first aperture (312) to be disposed in a
position chosen from against and adjacent an object to be colour measured, the

second end defining a second aperture to be disposed proximate the measuring
device, said reference area associated with said body proximate said first

aperture. 
A shield as claimed in claim 6 wherein the device has an illumination
source (80) and wherein the body is a unitary hollow body, wherein an object is

measured through said first aperture; and said first end includes the reference
area with the body and proximate said first aperture.
A shield as claimed in claim 7 wherein said means for attaching said
body to an instrument restricts ambient light from entering said body; and

further comprising means for indicating at least one of the origin of the shield,
lot number of the shield, expiration date of the shield and patient information,

said indicating means disposed proximate said first aperture and in said field of
view.
A shield as claimed in claim 1 wherein said body is disposable.
A shield as claimed in claim 1 wherein said body is reusable.
An instrument (10) for acquiring a colour image of a tooth within a field
of view (350), said instrument comprising: a housing; an illumination source

(80) within said housing for illuminating the field of view; an image sensing
device (56) within said housing for sensing an image of the tooth; and

a disposable shield (300) as claimed in any previous claim.
An instrument according to claim 11, wherein the disposable shield is
removably connected to said housing and provides a desired spacing between

the tooth and the image sensing device. 
An instrument as claimed in claim 12, wherein said second end provides
a light tight seal against said housing.
An instrument as claimed in claim 12, wherein said reference area
establishes a compensation factor for illumination.
