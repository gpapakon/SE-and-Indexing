<ABSTRACT>
This composition contains, in an appropriate cosmetic vehicle, a pseudolatex consisting of particles of a free-radical film-forming polymer containing carboxylic acid functional groups neutralised to a degree of neutralisation of between 10 and 80% using a multifunctional neutralising agent consisting either of a diamine or of the combination of a polyvalent metal salt and of an inorganic or organic base, the mean diameter of the said particles being between 10 and 450 nm. The composition is preferably provided in the form of a shampoo, a conditioner, a styling or treatment gel or lotion, or a hair shaping product or in the form of a make-up product such as a mascara or a nail varnish.
