<ABSTRACT>
Event or ambient condition detectors which incorporate isolation
circuitry will generate the address of the next detector. The detector which

receives the address communicates an acknowledge signal to the address assigning
detecting indicating that it has properly received the address. The address

receiving detector in turn, after storing the received address, increments same and
transmits it to an adjacent detector. The adjacent detector upon receipt of a valid

address acknowledges same. The detectors communicate on a bidirectional
communication link and utilize isolation circuitry for the purpose of transmitting

an address to be received by and stored in an adjacent detector. The isolation
circuitry can incorporate solid state or mechanical switches.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to detection systems, in particular systems which
incorporate a plurality of event or ambient condition detectors.Systems for monitoring regions of commercial and industrial
establishments have been found to be useful for security and safety purposes. One
type of system includes a control unit which is coupled to a plurality of spaced
apart ambient condition detectors via a communications link. The detectors can for
example include intrusion, smoke, flame, temperature or gas sensors.In such systems, detector designations, sometimes called addresses,
are used to facilitate communication and to identify a particular detector. The
control unit includes a data base that links detector addresses, arbitrarily assigned,
to physical locations. It is often useful to be able to establish which detectors are
adjacent to one another on the communication link.Addresses can be assigned when detectors are manufactured.
Alternately, they can be set at installation manually or by the control unit.Detectors are usually removably mountable on a permanently
installed base. A given detector can be removed for maintenance or repair and
then replaced on the respective base.When the detector, or detectors is, are replaced on the respective
base or bases, there is not necessarily any assurance that a given detector will be
replaced on the base from which it was removed. This presents a problem to the
control unit which must keep track of the locations of the detectors so as to be able
to map a particular detector, which may be indicating the presence of an event or
an ambient condition of concern, into a physical location. One solution to this problem has been disclosed and claimed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,357,243 entitled Electrical Unit with an Adjustable Mechanical Switch
For Address Verification, assigned to the Assignee hereof. The system of the '243
patent while effective, required that address switches installed on the detector be
manually set to an appropriate address corresponding to the address of the base.
Hence, a mismatch between a base and a detector kept the detector from engaging
the base.In another known approach, the detectors are coupled in series to a
communication line. The detectors open circuit the communication line, and then
close circuit the line sequentially.The control unit senses the first open circuited detector and it closes
the circuit therethrough. The control unit then senses the second detector and it
closes the circuit therethrough. Each of the detectors, which are serially
