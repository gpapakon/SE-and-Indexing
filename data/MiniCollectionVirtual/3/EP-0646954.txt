<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming high aspect ratio vias (376, 377, 378) through a plurality of 
polymeric dielectric layers (155a ... 155i) in a multichip module, and a multichip module structure 

incorporating such high aspect ratio vias are disclosed. Preferably, electron 
cyclotron resonance (ECR) etching is used to form the vias, at least some of which 

have aspect ratios greater than 3:1 and heights greater than 20 microns. According 
to the present invention, vias which extend to different patterned conductive layers (110, 115, 120) 

within the multichip module may be formed in a single step. The method is 
particularly useful for forming vias to capacitor plate layers within the multichip 

module because it substantially eliminates the risk of shorting due to defects in the 
mask layer when vias are formed solely through very thin dielectric layers between 

capacitor plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the packaging of 
semiconductor devices, and is specifically related to methods of forming high 
aspect ratio vias in semiconductor device packages, and to a multilayered 
packaging structure incorporating high aspect ratio vias. The device density of semiconductor integrated circuit chips (IC 
chips) has dramatically increased in the years since their initial introduction, such 
that millions of discrete components are now routinely included on a single IC 
chip. In addition, the clock speeds at which such chips operate has dramatically 
increased, such that digital signals at microwave frequencies are now heing used in 
high performance systems. The increasing complexity of the devices being used, 
along with the higher speeds of such devices, have challenged the traditional 
methods of packaging chips. Various multichip module structures have been developed to address 
the need to provide improved packaging for modern high-performance IC chips. 
One important reason for using multichip modules is to minimize signal 
propagation delay thereby improving system performance. Multichip module 
structures involve mounting a plurality of IC chips on one or more substrates to 
form a two- or three-dimensional array of chips. A substrate of a multichip 
module may include means for delivering power and ground to the individual chips 
mounted on the substrate, as well as signal paths for interconnecting the chips on 
the module, and for interconnecting these chips with other devices that are external 
to the module. In some instances, the delivery of power to the chips requires that 
more than one voltage level be provided. Finally, the substrate may also include 
by-pass capacitors to reduce DC noise associated with high speed switching of 
power to the chips. Due to the complexity of providing all of the foregoing to 
each of the chips mounted on a substrate, such substrates are often fabricated as 
multilayer structures, with various patterned conductive layers being used for the  
 
required voltages and ground connections, and other conductive layers being used 
for signal lines. As described, at least two layers of patterned conductive material 
may be dedicated to forming bypass capacitors. Interleaved between the patterned 
conductive layers are insulation layers to prevent shorting between the conductive 
layers. Initially, the primary technology for forming multilayered multi-chip 
module substrates was ceramic-based, (sometimes referred to as "co-fired" 
cer
