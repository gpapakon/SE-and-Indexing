<ABSTRACT>
An atomizing pump for dispensing a quantity of liquid in a fine spray. The pump mechanism is constructed entirely of plastic, including the inlet and outlet valves (10), the piston (4), pump housing (1), and spring (18). This construction allows the pump to be easily recycled. The pump can also be constructed using two biasing springs (118, 135). The first spring (118) is used only to return the pump piston (104); the second spring (135) is used only to bias the outlet valve. In this manner, the person operating the pump only presses downwardly against the force of the first spring (118), and not the second spring (135). As a result of this biasing arrangement, less actuation force is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
Atomizing pumps which dispense a quantity of liquid in a fine spray are
generally constructed with a metallic coil spring which is used to bias the pump
piston axially outwardly. More often than not, the spring is located within the
pump chamber, or below the pump chamber in a location through which liquid
flows on its way to the pump chamber. Examples of pumps which include a
metallic coil spring in the pump chamber include U.S. Patent Nos. 3,211,346;
3,746,260 and 4,113,145. Examples of pumps which include a metallic coil spring
in a location through which liquid flows on its way to the pump chamber include
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,025,046; 4,122,982 and 4,389,003. In all of these pumps, the
liquid to be dispensed contacts the metallic spring as it passes from the container
to the atmosphere via the pump.Although many atomizing pumps are still manufactured with metallic valve
mechanisms, other pumps have been created which eliminate the need for
metallic valve mechanisms. An example of the latter is shown in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,113,145; 4,144,987 and 4,389,003. However, these pumps still include a metallic
coil spring which is in contact with the liquid to be dispensed. The contact of
liquids with metallic elements, either valves or springs, can result in unwanted
chemical reactions which can degrade either the liquid or the metallic elements.
Furthermore, the existence of metallic parts within a plastic pump makes the
pump difficult to recycle, as the metallic parts must be removed from the plastic
before it is remelted. Another form of atomizing pump which has come into use in recent
years is the so-called "precompression" pump. This type of pump has an outlet
valve which opens in response to a predetermined minimum pressure in the
chamber. This is generally accomplished by including a valve member or stem
within the pump chamber which has a net upwardly-facing surface upon which
pressure acts. When the pressure acting on this valve is sufficiently high, it
overcomes a biasing spring, pushing the valve member downwardly and
opening the outlet valve. Examples of these types of pumps are found in U.S.
Patent Nos. 3,399,836; 4,025,046; 4,144,987 and, 4,389,003. These pumps use
a single metallic coil spring, which urges the valve member as well as the
piston member upwardly. Because this one spring is used to resist pressure
action on the valve stem and to return the pump piston, the spring must be
sufficiently stiff to provide both functions. However, this high stiffness
requires an operator to press down
