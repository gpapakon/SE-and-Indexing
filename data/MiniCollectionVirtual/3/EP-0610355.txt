<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYMERIC POWDER COATING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT POLYETHYLENE POLYOLSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to polymeric powder coating compositions. More particularly, the present invention relates to polymeric powder coating compositions which comprise a low molecular weight polyethylene copolymer or polyethylene terpolymer.10DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Powder coating compositions find wide use in the production of articles which require that a sheet, rod, tube, wire, or other structure need be imparted with a 15 coating of a polymeric material. For example, it may be desired that a continuous pipe be provided with an exterior jacket of a polymeric material so to provide particular benefits which may include resistance to corrosive effects in the environment, improvements in 20 the appearance thereof, or electrical or thermal insulation thereof. Alternately, it may be desired that a continuous rod like structure, or wire type structure be provided with an exterior jacketing of a polymeric materials. Generally, such articles are 25 provided with a powder coating composition by causing an uncrosslinked/uncured composition in a fine \ particulate form to be adhered to the exterior surf ce of the item desirably to be coated and thereafter « causing the crosslinking/curing of the composition by30 any of a variety of means which may include exposure to elevated temperatures, infrared radiation, or other effective means. 

 Accordingly, the art includes various teachings directed towards polymeric powder compositions.U.S. Patent 4,009,224 to Warnken describes a stable free-flowing epoxy resin powder which fuses to and cures upon striking an object which has been preheated to the curing temperature of the composition so to provide a tough protective coating. The compositions includes 3-30 party of a copolymer of 2- 50% vinyl acetate and 5-75% ethylene per 100 parts of the epoxy resin.A paper entitled "Developments in Thermoplastic Powders" by G.E. Barrett published in the proceedings of the 4th International Plastics Powder Coating Conference, London, UK, 5th and 6th of March 1974 describes properties, applications techniques and perfomrance of various thermoplastic powders used in protective coatings applications.An article indexed in the Chemical Abstracts 98:73886b titled "Properties of crosslinked coatings from modivied ethylene-vinyl acetate polymer" in Plast. Massy 1983, Vol. (1) , 56 described compositions which include a partially saponified ethylene-vinyl acetate
