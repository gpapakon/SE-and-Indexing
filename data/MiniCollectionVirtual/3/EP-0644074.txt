<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for driving a door 
arranged in a vehicle, movable substantially parallel to a 

wall of the vehicle and adapted to close an opening arranged 
in a vehicle wall, which device comprises a flexible belt, 

two ends of which are connected to the door, and a drive 
device connected to the vehicle which is adapted to exert 

tractive forces on the belt by means of engaging means. 
Such a door is particularly suitable for delivery 
vans in order to prevent deliverymen leaving open the door 

of their vehicle when delivering orders. 
The device is also particularly suitable for doors 
which, in addition to performing a movement parallel to a 

wall, also perform a movement substantially perpendicularly 
of this wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
driving a door arranged in a vehicle, movable substantially 
parallel to a wall of the vehicle and adapted to close an 
opening arranged in a vehicle wall, which device comprises a 
flexible belt, two ends of which are connected to the door, 
and a drive device connected to the vehicle which is adapted 
to exert tractive forces on the belt by means of engaging 
means. Such a device is not known up to the present time. Up until now such doors have therefore been opened 
and closed manually. There nevertheless exists a need for a mechanical 
drive device for such a door. This need is particularly felt 
by delivery and courier companies, wherein deliverymen or 
couriers in their haste often leave the door of their 
vehicle open when delivering the packages. This means that 
for the length of time necessary for delivering a package 
the door remains open, with a considerable danger of theft. 
This is of particular importance because the packages for 
delivering are often of a high value, or the documents are 
confidential. This problem likewise occurs in the collection of 
packages or documents. Opening and closing such a sliding door is moreover 
a difficult operation, wherein relatively great force is 
needed which, when not exerted with the necessary care, 
which is often the case when haste is required, can result 
in back complaints. It will be apparent that there is therefore a need 
for such a drive device. The invention meets the needs of such a drive device 
in that it is provided with a flexible belt, two ends of 
which are connected to the door, and a drive device 
connected to the vehicle which is adapted to exert tractive 
forces on the belt by means of engaging means. The use of a 
belt makes it possible to compensate any movements 
perpendicularly of the main direction of movement of the  
 
door, so that when the door becomes worn, the danger of gear 
wheels and gear racks or similar drive elements becoming 
disengaged is prevented. The application of a flexible belt moreover enables 
use of such a drive device in an existing vehicle. Few 
structural adjustments then have to be carried out on the 
vehicle itself. It will be apparent that it is desirable that, when 
the door is provided with a lock, the lock must be released 
before the door can be opened. The invention provides 
herefore in that at least one end of the belt is adapted to 
engage onto an auxiliary body which is resiliently connected 
to the door and which is connected with a

Device for driving a door arranged in a vehicle, 
movable substantially par
allel to a wall of the vehicle and 
adapted to close an opening arranged in a vehicle wall, 

which device comprises a flexible belt, two ends of which 
are connected to the door, and a drive device connected to 

the vehicle which is adapted to exert tractive forces on the 
belt by means of engaging means. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one end of the belt is adapted to engage on an 

auxiliary body which is resiliently connected to the door 
and which is connected with a transmission mechanism to a 

lock fixed on the door. 
Device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
door is provided with guide means for moving the door 

substantially transversely of the wall direction into and 
out of the closed position, characterized by guide means for 

guiding the flexible belt, which guide means are movable 
substantially transversely of the wall direction. 
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the guide means for the movement in the transverse 

direction are drivable by the drive means. 
Device as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that the drive means comprise a differential, the input 

shaft of which is driven by an electric motor, a first 
output shaft drives the transverse movement of the engaging 

means, and a second output shaft drives the rotating 
engaging means. 
Device as claimed in claim 5, characterized in 
that the differential comprises a planetary gear assembly. 
Device as claimed in any of the claims 3-6, 
characterized in that the guide means are formed by at least 

two rollers which are fixed to a carriage, which carriage is 
fixed on an arm which is drivable in rotation by the first 

output shaft of the differential. 
Device as claimed in any of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that to the inside of the door is fixed a 

 
profile to which the at least one auxiliary body is resiliently 

attached and which is adapted to guide the carriage. 
Device as claimed in claim 8, characterized in 
that the profile is provided with edges for retaining the 

belt and that additional guide wheels are arranged on the 
carriage for pressing the belt under the edges. 
Device as claimed in claim 8 or 9, characterizedin that the carriage is slidably connected to the profile by 
means of a ball-bearing circuit. 
Device as claimed in claim 10, characterized in 
that a path is arranged in the profile for the ball-bearing 

circuit which comprises at least two removable running 
surfaces. 
Device as claimed in any of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the device can be operated by 

means of a remote control.
