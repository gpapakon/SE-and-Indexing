TITLE OF THE INVENTIONNEW QUINAZOLINES AS INHIBITORS OF HIV REVERSETRANSCRIPTASEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of Merck Case 18727, USSN 07/880,119, filed May 7, 1992.A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system (acquired immune deficiency syndrome; AIDS) and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system. This virus was previously known as LAV, HTLV-III, or ARV. A common feature of retrovirus replication is reverse transcription of the RNA genome by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase to generate DNA copies of HIV sequences, a required step in viral replication. It is known that some compounds are reverse transcriptase inhibitors and are effective agents in the treatment of AIDS and similar diseases, e.g., azidothymidine or AZT.Nucleotide sequencing of HIV shows the presence of a pol gene in one open reading frame [Ratner, L. et al., Nature, 313. 277 (1985)]. Amino acid sequence homology provides evidence that the rjoi sequence encodes reverse transcriptase, an endonuclease and an HIV protease [Toh, H. et al, EMBO J. 4, 1267 (1985); Power, M.D. et ah, Science, 231, 1567 (1986); Pearl, L.H. et al., Nature 329, 351 (1987)].Applicants demonstrate that the compounds of this invention are inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. The particular advantages of the present compounds are their demonstrated inhibition of resistant HIV reverse transcriptase.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONCompounds of formula I, as herein defined, are disclosed. These compounds are useful in the inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase (and its resistant varieties), the prevention of infection by HIV, the treatment of infection by HIV and in the treatment of AIDS 

and/or ARC, either as compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts (when appropriate), pharmaceutical composition ingredients, whether or not in combination with other antivirals, anti-infectives, immunomodulators, antibiotics or vaccines. Methods of treating AIDS, methods of preventing infection by HIV, and methods of treating infection by HIV are also disclosed.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION ANDPREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThis invention is concerned with compounds of formula I, combinations thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase and its resistant varieties, the prevention or treatment of infection by HIV and in the treatment of the
