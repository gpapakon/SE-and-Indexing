<ABSTRACT>
A package blank and a packaging method 
for wrapping flat articles, such as 

diskettes, cassettes and books. A flat 
sheet of paperboard or cardboard is 

provided with a rectangular mid-section 
(1) defined by four bending lines 

(3, 5), one along each side of the 
rectangle. The sections beyond the 

sheet bending lines (3, 5) provide two 
side flaps (2) and two end flaps (4). 

The side flaps (2) defined by the 
longer bending lines (3) have a total 

width which exceeds the width of the 
rectangular mid-section (1). An article 

to be wrapped is placed on top of 
the rectangular mid-section (1) of a 

flat sheet and the side flaps (2) are 
folded along the bending lines (3), on 

top of the article to be wrapped. The 
side flaps (2) include overlapping 

sub-areas (2a) which are sized into 
contact with each other, whereby the 

side flaps (2) are subjected to a 
flexural stress between the bending 

line (3) and the overlapping sub-areas 
(2a). Finally, the end flaps (4) are 

folded along the bending lines (5), 
and the folded end flaps (4) are sized 

against the outer surfaces of the side 
flaps (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembled package containing a flat article,
such as a diskette, cassette or thin book, said package being made of a package
blank comprising a flat sheet including a rectangular mid-section defined by four
bending lines, one along each side of the rectangle, and the sections of said sheet
beyond the bending lines providing two side flaps and two end flaps, the side flaps
having overlapping sub-areas adjacent their longer edges and end sections adjacent
their shorter edges, and the end flaps being attached on outer surfaces of the end
sections of the side flaps, and the finished package having a border edge defined by
said bending lines. The invention relates also to a method for wrapping a flat article
such as a diskette, cassette or thin book in such a package.An assembled package as defined in the preamble of claim 1 has become
known from US-A-3,648,932. The package disclosed therein is a light-weight expansible
mailing envelope which is fabricated from a single blank of spun-bonded
olefin sheet stock. The 90° inside corners at the open mouth of the envelope include
radiust filets at the intersection of non-coextensive planes which the side gusset sections
form with the front and back panels. Corner closure flap extensions are incorporated
to increase the number of non-coextensive planes at the open end of the
envelope. Due to this structure, the envelope is adapted to be expanded into box-like
structure .GB-A-2 239 446 teaches a package having edge portions of V-shaped cross-section.
This package is made also of plastics and has one edge which is permanently
open so as to form a gripping nip at the periphery of a disk inserted into the
package.An object of the invention is to provide an assembled package and a method
for wrapping a flat article in such a package, which employ a package blank as 
simple and economical as possible and facilitating the automatic wrapping in highly
protective package, free movements of the article being prevented without internal
paddings.This object is achieved by means of an assembled package and a method as
defined in claims 1 and 5. The invention will now be described in more detail with
reference made to the accompanying drawing which is a plan
view and shows schematically a packaging line and a package
blank during various operations included in the packaging
method.The package blank is intended for packaging or wrapping flat
articles, such as diskettes, cassettes or thin books. The
package blank is a flat sheet of paperboard or
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An assembled package containing a flat article, such as a diskette, cassette
or thin book, said package being made of a package blank comprising a flat sheet

including a rectangular mid-section (1) defined by four bending lines (3, 5), one
along each side of the rectangle, and the sections of said sheet beyond the bending

lines (3, 5) providing two side flaps (2) and two end flaps (4), the side flaps having

overlapping sub-areas (2a) adjacent their longer edges and end sections adjacent
their shorter edges, and the end flaps (4) being attached on outer surfaces of the end

sections of the side flaps (2), the finished package having a border edge defined by
said bending lines (3, 5), characterized in that the sheet is made of relatively stiff

card board or paper board, that the outline of the article is substantially smaller than
that of said rectangular mid-section (1), and that the edge portions of the assembled

package are of V-shaped cross-section so that the thickness of the assembled
package increases from the border edge towards the outline of the article and said

side flaps (2) are subjected to flexural stress between its bending lines (3) and its
overlapping sub-areas (2a).
A package as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that the end flaps
(4) are of parallelogram shape and the longer of the parallel sides of the parallelogram

adjoins the bending line (5) which separates the end flap (4) from the
rectangular mid-section (1).
A package as set forth in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
rectangular mid-section (1) is provided with an address window (6). 
A package as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that the bending
lines (3, 5) each are a double line with the spacing between the parallel lines of the

double line being smaller than the thickness of the flat article to be packed.
A method for wrapping a flat article, such as a diskette, cassette or thin
books in a package as defined in any of the preceding claims, in which method the

article to be wrapped is placed on top of the rectangular mid-section (1) of the flat
sheet, the side flaps (2) are folded, each along said at least one bending line (3), on

top of an article to be wrapped, and overlapping sub-areas (2a) included in the side
flaps are attached with glue into contact with each other, whereby the side flaps (2)

are subjected to flexural stress between the bending line (3) and the overlapping
sub-areas (2a), followed by folding the end flaps (4), each along said at least one

bending line (5), and the folded end flaps (4) are glued against the outer surfaces of
the side flaps (2).
A method as set forth in claim 5, employing a package blank which is
provided with an address window (6), characterized in that on top of the rectangular

mid-section (1) is first placed an addressed invoice or a like form (7) and on top of
that is placed an article (8) to be wrapped.
A method as set forth in claim 5, characterized in that the package
advancing direction is deflected by 90° after the bending of the side flaps (2) but

before the bending of the end flaps (4).
