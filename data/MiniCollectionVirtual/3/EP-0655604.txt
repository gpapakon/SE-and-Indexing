<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bullet and to the
use of an Sn alloy therefor.*Understood by a bullet in this context are a solid
projectile and shot particles for a small-shot cartridge.At the present time lead alloys are used for bullets
for sport and professional purposes. There is however
increasing resistance to the use of such lead-containing
bullets, since fired bullets which are not found produce in
the environment ground pollution and accumulation of heavy
metals in organisms due to leaching.Another problem is that when the bullet is fired the
weight of the bullet decreases. This weight decrease takes
the form of lead-containing dust which is inhaled during
firing. Another further problem is that lead fumes are
inhaled during casting of the lead-containing bullets.A lead free bullet is known from WO 92/08097.Up to the present there has been no good alternative to
lead-containing bullets.A problem of other types of alloys, for instance based
on iron, is that such bullets are very hard, cause damage to
the barrel and, when trapped in trees, can result in damage
when such trees are sawn down.A high density projectile and method of making
the same is known from WO 92/22089.The invention has for its object to provide a bullet
substantially free of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium,
whereof both the interior ballistics (barrel fouling/dust
formation) and the exterior ballistics (predictable bullet
flight and accuracy) are optimal, while in terms of
dimensions the bullets can be properly calibrated and have a
narrow tolerance. After extensive alloy and firing tests a series of
alloys has been developed which substantially fulfil the
above described requirements and substantially do not have
the above described drawbacks.According to the present invention there is
provided a bullet based on an Sn alloy, wherein the
bullet comprises 60 wt.% or more Sn.A bullet according to the present invention is
substantially free of heavy metals, has good interior and
exterior ballistics, can be properly calibrated and have
a narrow tolerance.It has been found that bullets based on a
number of Sn alloys are satisfactory, wherein Cu, Sb, Bi
and/or Zn can be used as alloying element for such an Sn
alloy. With respect to the alloying element Cu, the Sn alloy
can contain 0.2-10% by weight Cu, preferably 0.2-6% by weight
Cu. Found to suffice well in practice were Sn alloys with
1-5% by weight Cu, such as Sn 3 Cu. Such Cu-containing Sn
alloys were found to have optimum interior and exterior
ballistics.With regard to
