<ABSTRACT>
When one switch (1) in an automatic call distribution (ACD) network 
has blocked services, calls are distributed to another switch (e.g. 2,3,4 or 5) with 

available services; such distribution is based on information stored in each switch 
(in 16). The stored information comprises a list of switches within the network 

wherein an availability status is associated with each service, and an availability 
status of a trunk connecting the initial switch and the other switches (2,3,4 or 5) in 

the network. Each switch sends an updated status to the other switches via a 
signaling network (107) whenever a service changes status.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of automatic call distribution systems 
(ACD), and more specifically to a non-blocking ACD network that efficiently 
handles call overflow. Automatic Call Distribution systems (ACD) are widely used to answer 
calls quickly while using as few telephone network resources as possible. When an 
ACD receives a call, the goal is to distribute the call to the first available operator or 
service circuit that can handle the call. These systems work well until call handling 
resources are at or near capacity. Several systems have been proposed and/or 
implemented that reroute calls to other ACD systems or other resources within the 
same ACD system at such times. These systems generally rely on a priority list so 
that, when services are blocked at one ACD, the list is consulted and the call is sent 
to another ACD system on the list. There are various algorithms (such as time of 
day, day of week, etc.) used for determining which entry in the list is used. These 
schemes do not take into account the specific situation when network resources are 
not available to deliver the call to the alternate destination and resources are not 
available at the alternate destination. This results in more blocked calls and higher 
network occupancy. Therefore, a problem in the art is that no ACD system can route 
a call from a switch with blocked resources to another switch with a reasonable 
degree of certainty that the destination switch and path thereto is not blocked. This invention provides a network ACD that, when one switch in the 
network has blocked resources, uses information stored in that switch to insure that 
the calls it distributes are routed to another switch which has available resources. 
When a call for a prespecified service is received at a switch, the switch first checks 
to determine whether it can handle the call. If the switch cannot handle the call, then 
the switch checks stored status tables to determine which other switches in the 
network can handle the call. The call is then delivered to the determined switch. 
The stored status tables comprise a list of switches within the network wherein an 
availability status is associated with each service (such a directory assistance, toll 
assistance, credit card, etc.), and an availability status of a trunk connecting the 
switch and the other switches in the network. The two statuses are "ANDed" 
together to derive the availability status. Advantageously, each switch sends an 
updated status to the other switches via
