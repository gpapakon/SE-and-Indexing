<ABSTRACT>
In construction of an upper cymbal (9) fastening assembly (11) in 
which a felt washer unit (17) holding an upper cymbal (9) 

is clamped between 
an upper lock nut unit (18) and a lower clutch nut unit (19) 

both arranged 
on a tubular holder (14) inserted over an extension rod (7), the 

clutch nut unit (19) is made up of a pair of locally joined sections 
one of which (25a) is elastically deformable toward the other when a 

vertical force is applied thereto. The elastic deformation 
brings said pair of sections (25) into firm pressure contact with the 

tubular holder (14) thereby preventing slacking of the 
clutch nut unit (19) 

due to vibrations during performance of the hi-hat cymbal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an upper cymbal fastening
assembly for a hi-hat cymbal, and more particularly relates to
improvement in a system for fastening an upper cymbal to an associated
extension rod on a hi-hat cymbal.The main parts of a hi-hat cymbal are mounted on a tripod
made up of 3 foldable legs. More particularly, the tripod supports
an upright lower pipe and an upper pipe is telescopically
coupled to the lower pipe by assistance of an wing screw which is
used for level adjustment. An extension rod extends slidably
through the lower and upper pipes with it exposed lower end being
operationally connected to a foot pedal attached to the tripod.
A return spring is accommodated in a spring casing arranged in
parallel to the lower pipe in order to urge the foot pedal to
return to its stand-by position when foot pressure is removed.
Upper and lower cymbals are attached to the upper section of the
extension rod exposed upwards from the upper pipe by assistance
of respective fastening assemblies.When the foot pedal is pressed downwards against repulsion
of the above-described return spring, the upper cymbal crashes
against the lower cymbal for sound generation. As foot pressure
is removed, the foot pedal resumes its stand-by position to 
separate the upper cymbal from the lower cymbal.Furious vibrations are generated on a hi-hat cymbal during
performance because of high pitch, repeated crash of both cymbals.
So, the cymbals must be firmly attached in position to the
associated extension rod without any undesirable displacement.
In particular the fastener assembly for the upper cymbal which
undergoes frequent, vertical reciprocation during performance, it
required to fasten upper cymbal reliably to the extension rod
whilst well withstanding furious vibrations.Examples of such a fastener assembly are disclosed in
Japanese Utility Model Publications Sho. 57-8059 and Shod. 62-30065.In the construction of JUMP Sho. 57-8059, a threaded pipe
provided with an outer thread is idly inserted over the upper
section of an extension rod and a tubular holder is attached atop
the threaded pipe whilst embracing the extension rod. A fastener
bolt is screwed into a radial threaded hole formed in the tubular
holder with its inner point in pressure contact with the extension
rod. At a position below the tubular holder, a felt washer
unit is inserted over the threaded pipe. The felt washer unit is
made up of a pair of felt pieces which sandwich an upper cymbal
between them. At a position between the tubular holder and

<CLAIMS>
An upper cymbal fastening assembly (11) for a hi-hat cymbal
stand (1) comprising


an elongated tubular holder (14) inserted over an extension rod
and made up of an upper main body (14a) and a lower threaded extension (14b),
a felt washer unit (17) inserted over said threaded extension (14b) of
said tubular holder (14) in order to clamp an upper cymbal (9),
a lock nut unit (18) screwed over said threaded extension (14b) of said
tubular holder (14) at a position above said felt washer unit (17),
a clutch nut unit (19) screwed over said threaded extension (14b) of
said tubular holder (14) at a position below said felt washer unit (17) in

order to clamp said felt washer unit (17) in cooperation with said
lock nut unit (18),

characterized by
said clutch nut unit (19) being made up of upper and lower sections
(25a, 25b) coupled to each other via a local joint (27)
whilst leaving a horizontal gap, and
one (25a) of said two sections being constructed elastically
deformable about said local joint (27) towards the other (25b) of said two

sections when a vertical force is applied thereto.
An upper cymbal fastening assembly as claimed in claim 1 in
which


said one section (25a) is configurated thinner than said the other
section (25b).
An upper cymbal fastening assembly as claimed in claim 1 in
which 


said vertical force is generated by a fastener bolt (29) in screw
engagement with said two sections (25a, 25b).
An upper cymbal fastening assembly as claimed in claim 1
further comprising


an elastic spacer (33) inserted into said horizontal gap.
