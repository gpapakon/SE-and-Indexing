<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with silylated polymers. It is known to provide polyoxyalkylenes with terminal 
groups containing a silicon atom and silicon-bonded hydrolysable 
groups through which curing reaction may be 
induced. Numerous methods of preparing such polymers by 
introducing hydrolysable silyl groups into the molecular 
chain have been proposed in the literature. For example, a 
silane having silicon-bonded hydrolysable groups X and a 
silicon-bonded hydrogen atom of the general formula 
X(3-b)RbSiH may be reacted with a polyether having groups 
including a -C=C- bond. There may be one or more -C=C- 
bonds present in the polyether molecule and these may be 
located as terminal groups on the chain or as pendant 
groups. In the case where there is one terminal -C=C-group, 
the other terminal group or groups may be hydroxyl. 
Materials of this general type have been mentioned in 
several patent specifications of which the earliest known 
to the applicant is G.B. 1 058 385. G.B. 1 058 385 
specifies various organic groups which may provide the 
hydrolysable group, namely hydrocarbonoxy, halohydrocarbonoxy, 
acyloxy, haloge-nated acyloxy, primary, 
secondary or tertiary amino radical in which the substituents 
are hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon radicals or a 
diorgano-substituted isocyanoxy radical of the general 
formula RxRyC=N-O- in which Rx and Ry are the same or 
different and are each a hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon 
radical. Numerous subsequent proposals for materials and 
methods of making them have been described in the art. 
These proposals include methods of preparing organic 
polymers by introducing hydrolysable silyl groups  
 
into the molecular chain which include, for example, those 
in which (1) a monomer having an epoxy group and a silicon 
containing hydrolysable group e.g. γ-glycidoxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane 
or γ-glycidoxytrimethoxysilane, is copolymerised 
with an alkylene oxide e.g. propylene oxide or 
ethylene oxide to produce a polyether having a hydrolysable 
silicon-containing group in the side chains; (2) a 
polyoxyalkylene glycol such as polyoxypropylene polyol or 
polytetramethylene diol is reacted with a compound having a 
functional group eg an isocyanato group, capable of reacting 
with a hydroxyl group of the polyoxyalkylene polyol 
and having a silicon containing hydrolysable group, thereby 
introducing a hydrolysable silicon containing group into 
the polymer chain end and (3) a polyisocyanate compound is 
reacted with a hydroxyl group of a polyoxyalkylene
