<DESCRIPTION>
 8-SUBSTITUTED HANTHINES AS PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORSThe present invention relates to certain novel compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for the preparation of such compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to the use of such compounds and compositions in medicine.Molecular Pharmacology, Volume 6, No. 6, 1970, p.597-603 discloses l,3-dimethyl-8-nitro-xanthine. This compound is disclosed as having lipolytic activity. Ann Chim, 47, 362-365 (1957) discloses 1,3- dimethyl-8-amino-xanthine and a process by which it may be prepared. No pharmacological utility is disclosed for this compound. Drug Res.27(1) Nr 19, 1977, pages 4-14, Van K.H. Klingler discloses certain 1,3-dimethyl- 8-substituted xanthines as intermediates solely in the synthesis of phenylethyl aminoalkyl xanthines. Drug Res. 31 (11), Nr. 12, 1981, R.G. Werner et al, pages 2044-2048 discloses certain l,3-dimethyl-8-substituted xanthines. No pharmacological activity is disclosed for these compounds.European Patent Application, Publication Number 0369744 also discloses certain 1,3- or 1,3,7- 8-H cycloalkylalkylene xanthines, for use inter alia as bronchodilators in the treatment of asthma.It has now been discovered that a novel series of 8-substituted xanthines show activity as phosphodiesterase inhibitors.These compounds are indicated to be good inhibitors of induced blood eosinophilia and that they are therefore potentially useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with increased numbers of eosinophils, such as asthma, and allergic disorders associated with atopy, such as urticaria, eczema and rhinitis.These compounds are also indicated to have bronchodilator activity and thus to be of potential use in the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, such as reversible airways obstruction and asthma. 

These compounds also have a protective effect against the consequences of cerebral metabolic inhibition. The said compounds improve data acquisition or retrieval following transient forebrain ischaemia and are therefore useful in the treatment of cerebral vascular and neuronal degenerative disorders associated with learning, memory and cognitive dysfunctions including cerebral senility, multi-infarct dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, age associated memory impairment and certain disorders associated with Parkinson's disease.These compounds are also indicated to have neuroprotectant activity. They are therefore useful in the prophylaxis of disorders
