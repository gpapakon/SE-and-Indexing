<ABSTRACT>
A gas analyser and detector has an infra red source, a 
gas chamber and a detector cell; the detector cell has a 

gas sample inlet, inlet and exit paths for an infra red 
beam and reflector means in the chamber comprising a 

convex surface and a concave surface. The reflector 
means ensures a long path length for the beam whilst 

reducing beam divergence and signal loss.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for determining the 
constituents of a gas, and for determining the concentration 
of particular constituents of the gas. Gas detectors have been known for many years and are 
used in industry and commerce for the analysis of samples 
and to find leakages which otherwise cannot be detected. 
Many detectors comprise fixed installations which raise an 
alarm if concentration of a particular gas rises above a 
predetermined limit. For example such detectors are used in 
coal mines to warn of potentially explosive gas mixtures. In recent times a demand has arisen also for a 
detector which can detect a range of different gases within 
a mixture, and their respective concentrations. Such a 
detector is useful for example where gas is collected from 
a landfill site for combustion in a power generator. The 
gas detector provides an analysis which permits the 
calorific value of the gas to be determined, and also 
provides information on gas concentrations which permits the 
gas to be burned in the most economical and environmentally 
friendly manner. These detectors are usually fixed 
installations and have no overall size constraints. A demand has also arisen for gas sniffers which detect 
concentrations of a particular gas in air and in the parts 
per million range. Such detectors may for example be 
mounted in a van which travels along roads seeking leaks 
from buried gas pipes.  Many of these prior art detectors are designed to 
detect only a particular gas or range of gases in a 
predetermined concentration band. Typically the detector 
apparatus comprises an infra-red source, a gas chamber and 
detector cell designed to sense absorption by the gas of 
infra-red radiation in a particular wavelength band. It is 
known that particular gases absorb infra-red radiation in 
distinctive patterns, and that the absorbtion characteristic 
is different for each gas. By choosing particular 
wavelength bands, the presence of a particular gas and its 
concentration can be determined. This is the principle on 
which many gas detectors work. An important constraint in gas detectors is that the 
infra-red path length must be sufficiently long to ensure 
that a measurable proportion of the infra-red radiation has 
been absorbed. The relationship between path length and the 
amount of radiation absorbed is of a generally logarithmic 
form and thus it is impractical to resolve all 
concentrations with a single path length of infra-red 
radiation. Instead the path length is chosen to
