<DESCRIPTION>
 "AQUATIC STEP EXERCISE APPARATUS"Field of InventionThis invention relates in general to exercise apparatus, and relates in particular to exercise apparatus primarily intended for use by a person while partially submerged in water.Background of the InventionExercise programs and equipment are used by many people for a variety of purposes. Some people are interested in maintaining or improving body strength, and those persons may exercise with free weights or with exercise machines designed or programmed to develop particular parts of the body. Persons may also engage in various aerobic exercise activities designed to improve respiratory and circulatory functions by increasing oxygen consumption of the body. Examples of aerobic exercise include running, walking, and swimming, and many people use exercise machines or devices such as treadmills, stair climbers, and aerobic step exercisers, to perform aerobic exercises indoor or within a relatively closed space.Generally speaking, the foregoing kinds of exercises and exercise equipment should be used by persons in good physical health who are working to maintain or improve their strength or stamina. However, exercise routines may also be important for those who, by reason of illness, mfirmity, or age, require physical therapy as a remedial treatment of bodily disorder. For example, persons who have undergone cardiovascular surgery or who are recovering from a heart attack may have prescribed a 

regimen of relatively light exercises to aid their physical rehabilitation. Exercise machines such as stair climbers or treadmills, even used sparingly, may simply be too stressful for many such therapeutic applications of exercise. Moreover, such exercise machines may appear intimidating to elderly or very infirm patients, who would feel more comfortable with exercises conducted in a familiar or nonthreatening environment.Summary of InventionStated in general terms, the exercise apparatus according to the present invention is designed and intended for use in a body of water such as a swimming pool, although it is also contemplated that the present invention may also be used on land. For its intended use in an aquatic environment, the present invention comprises a step exerciser having a base to contact a foundation surface such as the bottom of a pool, and a level platform supported by the base a predetermined distance above the foundation surface. For use in an aquatic environment, the apparatus has a specific gravity slightly greater than one, so that the

<CLAIMS>
1. Step exercise apparatus comprising: a body having a base for resting on a foundation surface so as to provide a stable support thereon for the apparatus; a level platform associated with the body in elevated relation to the base and in generally parallel relation to the foundation surface on which the base rests, so that a person can alternately step onto and off the platform from the foundation surface; the platform having an upper surface with means on the surface to provide positive grip for the feet when stepping onto and off the platform; and apertures between the means on the surface of the platform to permit a substantial flow of water through the platform when the apparatus undergoes movement within a body of water in a direction normal to the platform, thereby reducing the resistance of the apparatus to such movement
2. Apparatus as in Claim 1 , wherein: the means on the upper surface comprise raised elements protruding outwardly from the surface to provide a positive grip for the feet when stepping on and off the platform; and the apertures are between the raised elements of the upper surface.
3. Apparatus as in Claim 2, wherein: the raised elements comprise elongate ridges extending along the upper surface; and the apertures comprise elongate slots between the ridges.
4. Apparatus as in Claim 3, wherein: the elongate ridges extend substantially diagonal to the longitudinal axis of the platform.
5. Apparatus as in Claim 1, wherein the apparatus has a specific gravity greater than 1.0 so as to sink when immersed in water. 


 6. Apparatus as in Claim 1, further comprising: sides extending downwardly from the upper surface to form a skirt extending below the underside of the platform.
7. Apparatus as in Claim 1, wherein: the base comprises a pair of support members depending from the platform in mutually spaced apart relation, and each support member having a lower end for contacting the foundation surface.
8. Apparatus as in Claim 7, further comprising: an extension foot removably attached to the lower end of each support member and thereby increasing the elevation of the platform above the foundation surface on which the extension feet rest
9. Apparatus as in Claim 8, wherein: each extension foot has an element for engaging a mating locating element associated with the support member so as to provide a positive location of the extension foot in relation to the support member; and means on at least one of the extension foot and the support member for securing the extension foot in place on the support member, so that the extension member remains in place thereon when the platform is lifted off the foundation surface.
10. Apparatus as in Claim 9, wherein: the securing means comprises means defining a ledge on one of the support member and the extension foot; and means defining a locking finger on the other of the support member and the extension foot, the locking finger being positioned for engagement of the ledge when the extension foot is positioned on the support member so as to retain the extension member in place, and being resilient so as to yield sufficiently for removal of the extension member in response to manual force exerted on the extension member. 


 11. Apparatus as in Claim 1 , wherein: the body has a long dimension terminating in ends and flanked by the sides; and each end has a handle operative to permit a person to grasp and hold the apparatus while altemately moving the apparatus toward and away from the person while in the water, as a form of exercise.
12. Apparatus as in Claim 11, wherein: each handle comprises an opening formed through an end of the body adjacent the platform and defined by a smooth upper surface contiguous to the platform so that the weight of the platform is substantially balanced when the apparatus is held by the end handles while the platform is substantially vertical.
13. Apparatus as in Claim 1 , wherein: the body has a long dimension flanked by the sides; and each side has a handle operative to permit a person to grasp and hold the apparatus with the long dimension substantially vertical and the platform facing the person, while altemately moving the platform toward and away from the person while in the water as a form of exercise.
