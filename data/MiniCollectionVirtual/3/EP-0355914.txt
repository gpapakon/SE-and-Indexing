<ABSTRACT>
An overextensible, three-piece telescopic guide 
comprising an outer or housing bar (1), a middle bar (2) and 

an inner or drawer bar (3). The bars are slidable relatively 
to each other by means of two ball cages (4,5) respectively 

mounted between the housing bar and the middle bar and between 
the middle bar and the drawer bar. For the purpose of locking 

the bars (1,2,3) in the the direction of extension, loose 
sliding buffers (6,7) are mounted at both ends of the two ball 

cages (4,5) which sliding buffers are slidable within the 
corresponding bars and lock the middle and the drawer bars 

(2,3) in both extended end positions by means of end stops 
(12,14).

 
At each end (10) of the middle bar (2) a substantially 

triangular tilting member (8) is mounted, by means of which 
the guide's movement in the direction of extension is defined 

so that the drawer bar (2) and the middle bar (3) first move 
jointly outwardly until the middle bar (2) has reached its end 

position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an overextensible, 
three-piece telescopic guide, extensible in two directions, 
comprising an outer or housing 
bar, a middle bar and one inner or drawer bar, which bars are 
slidable relatively to each other by means of two ball cages 
respectively mounted between the housing bar and the middle bar 
and between the middle bar and the drawer bar, there being 
provided end stops engaging with the ball cages for locking the 
bars in the extended position relatively to each other in the 
direction of extension. A similar guide is known from US-A-4,183,596. In this known guide the end stops are formed by thickened 
corner parts of the outer, middle and inner bars, engaging the 
ball cages at their weakest points i.e. the corners thereof. 
These thickened corner parts are mounted in different vertical 
planes so that they can pass each other, which is mandatory in 
order to have a two way travel guide. The present invention aims to provide a guide of the kind 
described in which these drawbacks are overcome. To this effect 
the guide according to the invention is characterized in that 
at both ends of the two ball cages loose sliding buffers are 
mounted, which are slidable within the corresponding bars and  
 
lock the middle bar and the inner bar in both extended end 
positions by means of end stops. Mounting loose sliding buffers that are slidable within 
the corresponding bars permits the end stops not to engage with 
the ball cages directly but with said loose sliding buffers, 
which engage with the vertical body of the ball cages and 
therefore function as end stops. The sliding buffers can be 
made of a synthetic material, so that the shocks on the ball 
cages are absorbed. To lock the sliding buffers the middle bar is preferably 
provided at both ends with a strike plate which serves as an 
end stop for both the sliding buffer of the outer ball cage and 
the sliding buffer of the inner ball cage. To prevent the inner or drawer bar from being taken out of 
the middle bar in the direction of extension, said inner bar is 
provided at both ends with inwardly turned side edges for 
locking the sliding buffers of the inner ball cage. A further drawback of the guide according to US-A-4,183,596 
consists in the fact that in the retracted position 
the inner or drawer bar is extended first, the middle bar being 
locked by locking elements, so that said middle bar is 
prevented from sliding out simultaneously with the drawer bar. It is preferred, however, that when a drawer or box

<CLAIMS>
An overextensible, three-piece telescopic guide, extensible in 
two directions comprising 

an outer or housing bar (1), a middle bar (2) 
and one inner or drawer bar (3), which bars 

(1, 2, 3) are slidable relatively to each other by means of two 
ball cages (4, 5) respectively mounted between the housing bar 

(1) and the middle bar (2) and between the middle bar (2) and 
the drawer bar (3), there being provided end stops (12, 14) 

engaging with the ball cages (4, 5) for locking the bars (1, 2, 
3) in the extended position relatively to each other in the 

direction of extension, characterized in that at both ends of 
the two ball cages (4, 5) loose sliding buffers (6, 7) are 

mounted, which are slidable within the corresponding bars (1, 
2; 2, 3) and lock the middle bar and the inner bar (2, 3) in 

both extended end positions by means of end stops (12, 14). 
A telescopic guide according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the middle bar (2) is provided at both ends with a strike 

plate (10), which constitutes an end stop for both the sliding 
buffer (6) of the outer ball cage (4) and the sliding buffer 

(7) of the inner ball cage (5). 
A telescopic guide according to claims 1-2, characterized 
in that the inner bar (3) is provided at both ends with 

inwardly turned side edges (13) for locking the sliding buffers 
(7) of the inner ball cage (5).  

 
A telescopic guide according to claims 1-3, characterized 
in that at both strike plates (10) of the middle bar (2) a 

substantially triangular tilting member device (8) is mounted, 
which can pivot on a pin (9) which is perpendicular to the 

direction of travel of the bars (X, Y), the inner bar (3) thus 
being locked in between the two tilting members (8) when the 

guide is in the middle position, and of which tilting member 
(8) one corner (A) can slide along the outer bar (1), in which 

position a second corner (B) prevents the inner bar (3) from 
sliding. 
A telescopic guide according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the tilting member (8) is mounted on the pin under spring 

tension in such a way that the tilting member (8) does not 
pivot until after the middle bar (2) has reached its end 

position. 
A telescopic guide according to claims 4-5, characterized 
in that the tilting member (8) is provided with a hexagonal 

recess (15) and a slot (11) extending across said recess, the 
pin (9) of the tilting member (8) being of hexagonal shape as 

well.
