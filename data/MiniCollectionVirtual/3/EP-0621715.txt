<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement (1005) that automatically generates and manages a 
subscriber's personal greeting for a voice message system (1000), based upon 

information contained in the subscriber's electronic schedule database (1007), such 
as a calendar manager program's database, stored in a computer (1002). The 

arrangement, implemented as a process on the computer, periodically converts 
information for the present time that is stored in the schedule database (1007) into a 

voicable greeting, using text-to-speech conversation facilities, and sends the greeting 
to the voice message system (1000) for conventional use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to telecommunications, and particularly 
to messaging arrangements, such as voice messaging arrangements. Voice messaging systems, such as the AT&T Audix® system, typically 
allow a service subscriber to record one or more messages, referred to as personal 
greetings, for presentation to callers who are attempting to reach the subscriber, 
immediately upon a caller becoming connected to the voice messaging system. 
Many subscribers like to use the personal greeting mechanism as a way to provide 
information about their whereabouts during the day. The personal greeting can then 
be used by the caller to locate the subscriber, e.g., for emergency communications or 
interactions. Alternatively, the personal greeting informs the caller when and where 
the subscriber will be available for normal contact. But a subscriber's schedule may 
be such that the personal greeting may need to be changed several times during a 
day, according to the subscriber's changing schedule. It is very cumbersome and 
inconvenient to require that the subscriber manually re-record and administer a new 
personal greeting with such frequency. This invention is directed to solving these and other problems and 
disadvantages of the prior art. Illustratively according to the invention, there is 
provided an arrangement for the automated generation and management of a 
subscriber's personal greeting based upon information contained in the subscriber's 
electronic schedule database (e.g., appointments schedule file, calendar database). 
Such databases are often already maintained by subscribers for use with one of the 
many popular and commercially-available calendar-tool application programs. The 
arrangement accesses the schedule information in the database and uses text-to-speech 
conversion facilities to generate a personal greeting for the subscriber from 
this information. The arrangement further periodically re-accesses the schedule 
information to detect changes therein and uses the information to generate a new, 
updated, personal greeting for the subscriber. Generally according to the invention, there is provided an arrangement 
that integrates an automatic source of user schedule information, such as a user 
schedule database, with a messaging system having a user personal-greeting 
capability. The arrangement, illustratively implemented in a processing apparatus 
such as a computer, automatically generates a user personal greeting from user  
 
schedule information obtained from the automatic
