invention includes:


(a) a step of supplying a thin plate of band form from
the longitudinal direction,
(b) a step of forming a plurality of intermittent cuts
parallel to the edge in a first region, excluding the

central portion, of the thin plate of band form,
(c) a step of bending the central portion at a desired
angle, and
(d) a step of expanding and developing the cuts in the
width direction, while moving sequentially in the

longitudinal direction the thin plate having the first
region forming the plurality of cuts and the central

portion not having the cuts,

   in which the first track distance of the outermost side
portion of the first region having the cuts developed and

formed is nearly the same distance as the track distance of
the central portion.
In such the constitution, the plane distortion of the
grid is eliminated, the width dimension of the grid is

stable, and the quality of the electrode plate using such
grid is enhanced. Further, local stress concentration of

the grid is suppressed. As a result, the battery using the
grid of the invention presents an excellent life 

characteristic, small performance fluctuation width, and a
stable performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of expanded grid used in a storage battery, and a manufacturing apparatus of expanded grid.Generally, an expanded grid used as the core of an electrode of a storage battery is manufactured in a step of forming parallel intermittent cuts in the width direction in a surface of a region excluding the central portion of a thin plate in a band form made of metal such as lead or lead alloy continuously in a zigzag form, and a step of expanding and developing the thin plate having cuts in the width direction. The expanded grid used widely as the grid for electrode plates of a lead acid storage battery is superior to the casting grid in the mass producibility, and is suited to the lead acid storage batteries of mass-produced automobiles. Recently, a higher performance is demanded in the batteries, and it is required to reduce the mesh size of the grid in order to enhance the current collecting effect of the grid.However, in such expanded grid expanded and developed in the width direction by extending the cuts sequentially, the track distance at the outermost side of the band metal plate is longer than the track distance in the central portion. Accordingly, creases are formed when developing the thin plate having cuts in a flat plane, and the creases cause deflection, which results in periodic creases in the developed grid. Owing to such creases, the width dimension of the grid becomes unstable. As a result, it takes much labor in adjusting the manufacturing condition. Still more, the dimensional precision of the electrode plate is not stable, and the quality fluctuations are significant. In addition, a local distortion occurs in the grid, and is likely to promote grid corrosion. Such phenomenon occurs more obviously in grids with smaller mesh size. US 4303747, EP 682378 and US 4221032 disclose methods for manufacturing an expanded grid. GB 2200069 discloses a machine for producing such grid.A method of manufacturing expanded grid of the invention includes:
(a) a step of supplying a thin plate of band form from the longitudinal direction,(b) a step of forming a plurality of intermittent cuts parallel to the edge in a first region, excluding a second region, of the thin plate of band form, and(c) a step of expanding and developing the cuts in the width direction, while moving sequentially in the longitudinal direction the thin plate having the first region forming the plurality of cuts and the second region not having the cuts,
