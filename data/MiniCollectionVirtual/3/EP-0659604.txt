<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fuel tank arrangement with a storage (reserve) tank (3) in a fillable main tank (1) and with a fuel return line (4) which opens into the storage tank (3). To establish a flow connection between a feed line (9) leading to the engine and the storage tank (3) only when the main tank (1) is empty or when the fuel in the main tank shifts during cornering, the said fuel tank arrangement contains a valve (10) which can be actuated by a level sensor (17, 18) in the main tank (1).

<CLAIMS>
Fuel tank arrangement for the purpose of supplying an internal combustion 
engine comprising a fuel supply line (9) by means of which fuel is conveyed from 

the fuel tank arrangement, a storage container (3) disposed in a fillable main 
container (1), into which storage container issues a fuel return line (4), a valve (10) 

by means of which the storage container (3) can communicate with the fuel supply 
line (9), and furthermore a level sensor (17, 18) byway of which the valve (10) is 

actuated connecting the fuel supply line (9) with the storage container (3) only when 
a predetermined minimum fuel level in the main container (1) is not achieved, 

characterised in that the level sensor (17,18) is in the main container (1) and that 
the valve (10) connects the fuel supply line (9) alternately to the main container (1) 

or the storage container (3). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that the level sensor 
comprises a float (17) which is mechanically connected to the valve (10). 
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the storage 
container (3) is connected in close proximity to the base to the main container (1) 

in such a manner as to allow the passage of any leakage and comprises an 
overflow (5) which leads into the said main container. 
Arrangement according to claim 3, characterised in that the overflow (5) 
comprises a down pipe (6) which issues at the main container side immediately in 

front of the valve (10).  
 
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
valve (10) mounted on the main container base (2) protrudes with its active parts 

(11, 12) into a chamber (8) provided in a wall of the storage container (3) and 
connected to the supply line (9). 
Arrangement according to claim 5, characterised in that the valve (10) 
comprises as active parts two flaps (11, 12) which are rigidly connected to each 

other whilst forming an angle and lie alternately in a sealing manner on valve seats 
(14, 15) at the chamber (8).
