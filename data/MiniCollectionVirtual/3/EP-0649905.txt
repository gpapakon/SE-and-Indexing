<ABSTRACT>
A method for detecting or quantitating a mutagenic 
substratance in a sample includes culturing a host 

microorganism transformed with a recombinant gene 
comprising an SOS gene and genes expressing luciferase 

activity and optionally genes expressing an enzyme which 
catalyzes the production of a substrate for luciferase, 

positioned downstream of the SOS gene, in a medium to 
which the sample is added; and measuring a luminescence 

generated by expression of the gene expressing luciferase 
activity. The method is sensitive, accurate and non-time 

consuming; and gene systems used for said method, i.e., a 
recombinant gene comprising an SOS gene expressed when a 

DNA is damaged and a gene expressing luciferase activity 
positioned downstream of the SOS gene, and a host 

microorganism transformed with said recombinant gene. 
Preferably the recombinant gene further comprises a gene 

expressing an enzyme which catalyses the production of a 
substrate for the luciferase in the down stream of the 

SOS gene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for
detection of mutagenic substances using a luminescence
gene. In one embodiment, the present method uses a
luciferase gene, and in another embodiment the present
method uses a luciferase gene and a gene expressing an
enzyme catalyzing the production of a substrate for the
luciferase.At present there are many reports relating to
test methods using microorganisms for short term
screening of carcinogens. Among them, Ames test using
reverse mutation of a microorganism is widely used.
However, this test method has drawbacks. For example, it
takes about three days for completion of the test.
Recently, short term methods (umu test and SOS chromo
test) which detect damages to a DNA by genotoxic
substances such as mutagenic substances different from
Ames test which detects a mutation of a microbial cell
were reported (Oda, Nakamura et al., 'Evaluation of the
new system (umu-test) for the detection of environmental
mutagens and carcinogens", Mutation Research, 147,
219 - 229, 1985; Japanese Examined Patent Publication
(Kokoku) 4-12118).In these methods, an SOS response caused by DNA
damage is measured as an amount of β-galactosidase
expressed by lacZ gene positioned in the downstream of
one of SOS genes i.e., umu D,C genes or sfiA gene, to
detect damages to a DNA by genotoxic substances such as
mutagenic substances.More specifically, Salmonella typhimurium (umu
test) or E.coli (SOS chromo test) introducing the above-mentioned
gene is cultured in the presence of a substance 
to be tested, and the cells were disrupted by the
addition of toluene or chloroform, and an aqueous
solution of a sulfonate type surfactant such as sodium
dodecylbenzene sulfonate, to the culture broth, if
necessary after dilution with a buffer. Next, to measure
β-galactosidase activity, an aqueous solution of a
substrate for β-galactosidase, i.e., 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside
is added thereon, an enzyme reaction is
carried out at 28°C, and some ten minutes later, the
reaction is terminated with sodium carbonate. An optical
density of the enzyme reaction mixture is measured at two
wave lengths (420 and 550 nm), and a β-galactosidase
activity is calculated according to Miller's method
(Miller. J.H., Experiments in molecular genetics, Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1972).The above-mentioned umu test and SOS chromo
test are characterized by simple and speedy detection in
comparison with Ames test. However, sensitivity is low
and it takes 7 to 8 hours for the detection. Especially,
in these
