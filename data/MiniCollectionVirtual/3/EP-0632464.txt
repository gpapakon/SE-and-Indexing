<ABSTRACT>
A method of directly reading the current of cells 
(7, 8) of a memory (3) forming part of a microcontroller 

(1, 1') by performing a write operation of the cells and 
using the existing cell programming logic. For this 

purpose, the programming voltage supply line (16) is 
supplied with a low voltage (e.g. 1 V); the word line of 

the cell for reading is enabled; and a write instruction 
of a data item presenting a predetermined logic level 

(e.g. zero) is performed at the bit corresponding to the 
cell for reading. By providing an additional pass transistor 

(25) connected to each reference bit line (RBL) 
and an additional reference cell enabling line (REF-EN), 

the reference cells (8) may also be read directly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
measuring the current of microcontroller memory cells and to a system adapted to carry out such method.As known, most single memories (i.e. integrated in
a chip housing only the memory) present pins for
measuring the current of the cells and on to which a
voltage of roughly 1 V is forced directly at the
measuring step for measuring the current of each cell.
Such a method is extremely useful when checking and
engineering the memory.At present, however, the above method is not
applicable to microcontrollers featuring nonvolatile
EPROM or flash-EEPROM memories, due to the impossibility
in general of providing them with the numerous
additional pins required, or of performing the cell reading
function using the existing pins on the
microcontroller, which already provide for diverse
functions. Moreover, the same memory configuration may
be used for designing various differently structured
microcontrollers, so that a solution suitable for one is
not necessarily suitable for others. EP-A-0 318 363 discloses a method of reading the current of
cells of an EEPROM comprising the steps of supplying a
current reading voltage to a program voltage supply line of
the memory; performing a write instruction of a
predetermined cell; and measuring the current flow through
the predetermined cell, wherein the current reading voltage
has a value lower than a write voltage and insufficient to
write a cell.The article "A 512-kb Flash EEPROM Embedded in a 32-b
Microcontroller" by Kuo et al., IEICE TRANSACTIONS, vol.
E75-C, no. 4, April 1992, Tokyo, JP, pages 472-479
discloses the general architecture of a microcontroller,
according to the preamble of claims 1 and 4. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a method designed to overcome the aforementioned
drawbacks, and which provides for directly reading the
current of even microcontroller integrated memory cells.According to the present invention, there is
provided a method of measuring the current of
microcontroller memory cells, as claimed in Claim 1.According to the present invention, there is also
provided a system comprising a microcontroller as claimed in Claim 4.Two preferred, non-limiting embodiments of the
present invention will be described by way of example
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig.1 shows a block diagram of the architecture of
a first embodiment of the microcontroller according to
the present invention; Fig.2 shows a block diagram of a variation of the
Fig. 1 microcontroller.
