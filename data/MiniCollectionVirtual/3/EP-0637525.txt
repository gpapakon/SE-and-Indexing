<ABSTRACT>
In a method for avoiding motor vehicle collisions in which the distance between a motor vehicle and an obstacle located in front is determined by means of a distance measuring device and when the distance is critical a warning measure is triggered, the critical distance is shortened if the motor vehicle's own speed is reduced.

A method of avoiding collisions of motor vehicles, wherein the distance of 
a vehicle from an obstacle in front is determined by a distance meter and, when 

the distance becomes critical, a warning step is initiated if the actual speed of the 
vehicle is being reduced, characterised in that if, as a result of releasing the 

accelerator pedal and/or actuating the brake pedal, an impending reduction in speed 
is deduced, the critical distance is shortened even before the reduction has 

occurred. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the reduction in speed 
is determined from the change in speed of at least one wheel of the vehicle. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the variation in 
speed of the actual vehicle (the actual acceleration) is compared with the variation 

in time of the distance (the acceleration of approach), and the critical distance is 
shortened and the warning step is postponed as long as the actual acceleration is 

greater than or equal to the acceleration of approach. 
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the warning step in the 
extreme case is triggered at a critical distance which has a preset minimum value. 
A method according to claim 4, characterised in that the minimum value 
depends on the actual speed of the vehicle. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
warning step is triggered only when the distance falls below the critical value 

during a preset time. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a 
sequence of warning steps is carried out if the vehicle is at less than the critical 

distance, and the sequence of steps is associated with successive distance values  
 

obtained by dividing the critical distance in accordance with the number of 
successive steps. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that if the 
obstacle is removed the critical distance is reset at the value which was standard 

before the obstacle appeared.
