<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGH-VOLTAGE-STABLE ELECTROLYTES FOR Liι+xMn204/CARBON SECONDARY BATTERIESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to non-aqueous electrolyte compositions for secondary (rechargeable) lithium battery cells and, more particularly, to electrolyte compositions that are capable of resisting decomposition normally resulting from oxidation which occurs in Li1+xMn2θ4 / carbon cells during recharging under conditions of greater than about 4.5 V or 55° C.The advantages generally provided by rechargeable lithium batteries are often significantly overshadowed by dangers of the reactivity of lithium in cells which comprise lithium metal as the negative electrode. A more advanced and inherently safer approach to rechargeable lithium batteries is to replace lithium metal with a material capable of reversibly intercalating lithium ions, thereby providing the so-called "rocking-chair" battery in which lithium ions "rock" between the intercalation electrodes during the charging/recharging cycles. Such a Li metal-free "rocking-chair" battery may thus be viewed as comprising two lithium-ion-absorbing electrode "sponges" separated by a lithium-ion conducting electrolyte usually comprising a Li+ salt dissolved in a non-aqueous solvent or mixture of such solvents. Numerous such salts and solvents are known in the art, as evidenced in Canadian Patent Publication No. 2,022,191, dated 30 January 1991.The output voltage of a rechargeable lithium battery cell of this type is determined by the difference between the electrochemical potential of Li within the two intercalation electrodes of the cell. Therefore, in an effective cell the 

positive and negative electrode materials should be able to intercalate lithium at high and low voltages, respectively- Among the alternative materials that can effectively replace lithium metal as the negative electrode, carbon provides the best compromise between large specific capacity and good reversible cycling behavior. Such use of carbon, however, presents some detractions, such as loss of average output voltage and energy density, as compared to lithium metal, since the voltage of a LixC6 negative electrode is always greater than that of a pure lithium negative electrode.To compensate for the loss of voltage associated with the negative electrode, a strongly oxidizing intercalation material is preferably used as the positive electrode. Such an electrode material is the spinel phase Li1+xMn °4' usually combined with a small amount of carbon black to improve electrical conductivity
