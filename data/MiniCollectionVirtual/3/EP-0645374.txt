<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 5-amino-2-phenoxysulfonanilide 
compound having anti-inflammatory, 
antipyretic, analgesic and antirheumatic actions. Various 2-phenoxysulfonanilide compounds have 
been known in the past and especially the compounds 
described in the specification of U.S. Patent No. 
4,885,367 are considered to be the structurally close 
to the compound of the present invention. However, these compounds described in the 
above-mentioned specification are insufficiently 
effective. An object of the present invention is to 
provide drugs having excellent anti-inflammatory, 
antipyretic, analgesic and antirheumatic actions. As a result of extensive researches for the 
purpose of solving the above-mentioned problem, the 
present inventors have found that a 5-amino-2-phenoxysulfonanilide 
compound has excellently useful 
anti-inflammatory action, and have accomplished the 
present invention.  
 The present invention relates to a 5-amino-2-phenoxysulfonanilide 
compound represented by Formula (I): 
 
and to pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In the present invention, the salt refers to 
salts with alkali metals (e.g. sodium and potassium), 
alkaline earth metals (e.g. calcium and magnesium), 
ammonia and organic bases (e.g. ethanolamine, lysine and 
arginine). The compound of Formula (I) of the present 
invention can be prepared, for example, by the following 
preparation steps (a) to (f). 
(a) First, 2-fluoro-5-nitroaniline is reacted with 
methanesulfonic acid or a reactive derivative thereof 
(e.g. acid halides or acid anhydrides) to give a compound 
represented by Formula (II): 
 
This reaction wherein the methanesulfonic acid 
is used is preferably carried out in the presence of a 
condensing agent such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 
In case where the reactive derivative is used, the  
 
reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a 
base such as, for example, inorganic bases (e.g. lithium 
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium 
carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or 
potassium bicarbonate) or organic bases (e.g. triethylamine, 
tri-n-butylamine, 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-5-nonene, 
1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-7-undecene, 4-methylmorpholine, 
1-methylpiperidine, pyridine or N,N-dimethylaminopyridine). This reaction is usually carried out in the 
presence of a solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, 
chloroform, ethyl acetate, dioxane, 
tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether, benzene, toluene, xylene, 
acetone, acetonitrile, water,
