<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to an arc-quenching coating compositions having 
effective arc-quenching properties and improved track resistance properties that are 

relatively easy to apply and operationally positioned in high voltage current limiting 
fuses or expulsion fuses, circuit breakers, circuit interrupters, separable cable 

connectors, or the like. The arc-quenching coating composition comprises an arc-quenching 
material (A) and a film-forming polymer (B) having minimal tracking 

properties, wherein the film-forming polymer (B) acts as a liquid vehicle for the 

coating composition. The arc-quenching material (A) is preferably selected from the 
group of guanidine, guanidine carbonate, guanidine acetate, 1,3-diphenylguanidine, 

guanine, melamine, melamine cyanurate, urea, hydantoin, allantoin and derivatives and 
mixtures thereof. The film-forming polymer (B) is preferably selected from the group 

of urethane, acrylic, melamine-formaldehyde and derivatives and mixtures thereof. 
The invention is also directed to an arc-quenching composition having effective 
arc-extinguishing properties, and improved non-tracking properties and thermal stability 

selected from the group of guanidine carbonate, guanidine acetate, 1,3-diphenyl-guanidine, 
guanine, melamine cyanurate, urea, hydantoin and allantoin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of high voltage circuit interruption in electrical 
devices such as switchgears, transformers, and the like, and in particular concerns high 
voltage current limiting fuses or expulsion fuses, circuit breakers, circuit interrupters, 
separable cable connectors, or the like, comprising an arc-quenching composition which 
is adapted to rapidly evolve a gas in the presence of an electric arc to aid in arc 
extinction, and thereby quickly and effectively break the circuit. More particularly, 
the invention is directed to arc-quenching coating compositions having excellent arc-quenching 
properties and improved track resistance properties that are relatively easy 
to apply and operationally position in high voltage current limiting fuses. Expulsion fuses or gas-evolving fuses have been used extensively for high 
voltage circuit interruption in switchgears, transformers, and other electrical equipment. 
It is generally known that the use of arc-quenching or gas-evolving materials in such 
a circuit interruption device positioned in contact with the fusible element aids in, inter 
alia., deionizing, cooling, and thus quenching of the electric arc created under fault 
current conditions. A typical high voltage fuse comprises a generally tubular casing of electrical 
insulating material; a pair of terminal elements closing each of the opposite ends of the 
casing; a pulverulent arc-quenching filler material of high dielectric strength inside the  
 
casing such as sand, mica beads, or finely divided quartz; a fusible element or elements 
made of a highly conductive material such as silver submersed in the filler and 
conductively interconnecting the terminal elements, the fusible elements typically being 
wound in a parallel-connected relationship along the length of a supporting core; a core 
of high dielectric strength electrically insulating high temperature material such as 
ceramic, the core providing support for the fusible element by longitudinally and 
radially extending, i.e., providing fins having a cross-shaped, star-shaped or the like 
cross-section, along the longitudinal axis of the casing; and a gas-evolving material 
distributed along the length of the core or comprising part of the core itself in contact 
with the fusible element or elements. In operation, when the high voltage current limiting fuse is subjected to an 
applied current that exceeds the current carrying capability of the fusible element, the 
excessive current generates heat whereby the fusible
