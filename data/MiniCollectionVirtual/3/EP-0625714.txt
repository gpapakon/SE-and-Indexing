<ABSTRACT>
In a method for transmitting a data message comprising a synchronization 
section and a data section stored in a transponder device (10) to an 

interrogating device (12) in full duplex mode the interrogating device (12) 
continuously emits an interrogating command, the receipt of which in the 

transponder device (10) prompts output of the data message. Both the sync 
section and the data section of the data message each comprise a 

predetermined number of bits in accordance with a given transmission 
protocol. In the sync section a predetermined number N of sequential bits of 

duration τ is replaced by a lesser number n of sequential bits of longer 
duration T, where: 


T = τ N/n 
 
. The interrogating device (12) "sees" the location 

of the sync section and thus the start of the data section in the received 
data message by receiving bits having the longer duration T. For the ratio 

N/n a value is selected which is smaller than 1.5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of transmitting a data message 
comprising a synchronization section and a data section stored in a 
transponder device to an interrogating device in full duplex mode in which 
the interrogating device continuously emits an interrogating command, the 
receipt of which in the transponder device prompts output of the data 
message, whereby both the sync section and the data section of the data 
message each comprise a predetermined number of bits in accordance with a 
given transmission protocol and whereby in the sync section a 
predetermined number N of sequential bits of duration τ is replaced by a 
lesser number n of sequential bits of longer duration T, where: 
T = τ N/n  
 and 
whereby the interrogating device "sees" the location of the sync section and 
thus the start of the data section in the received data message by receiving 
bits having the longer duration T.  In transmitting a data message from a transponder device to an 
interrogating device it is usual to proceed on the basis of a transmission 
protocol which precisely defines how the data message is configured. For 
example it has been proposed to compose the data message of a sync section 
of 8 bits and a data section of 64 bits. The sync section is required so that 
the interrogating device receiving the data message can be synchronized to 
the bit rate and particularly also so that the start of the data section, 
containing the actual information to be transmitted, can be explicitly 
identified. One possibility of identifying the sync section involves, for example, using 
always the same bit pattern for this section of the data message. This 
possibility has the disadvantage, however, that all possible bit patterns can 
no longer be used because should, by chance, the same bit pattern occur in 
the data section as in the sync section then explicitly establishing the start 
of the data section in the data message is no longer possible. To eliminate this restriction as regards the content of the data section it 
has been proposed to apply the so-called code-violation method in the sync 
section. In this method it is assumed that in transmitting the data message 
the individual bits are output at a prescribed bit rate. To identity the sync 
section 3 bits in direct sequence are replaced in this section by 2 bits, the 
duration of which is lengthened, however, so that together they have the 
same duration as the 3 bits. This means that in the sync section bits having 
the bit rate occur which is used for
