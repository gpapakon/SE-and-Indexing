<ABSTRACT>
A dual gate FET structure allowing the FET to achieve 
a high gain, and circuits utilizing the dual gate FET 

including a variable gain amplifier and a mixer. The gate 
width of the first (source side) gate electrode is different 

from the width of a second (drain side) electrode. When the 
dual gate FET is used in a variable gain amplifier, high gain 

can be obtained when the drain-side gate is made narrower 
than the source-side gate. With the gate widths of the first 

and second gate electrodes reversed (source-side gate 
narrower) the FET is particularly well suited for use in a 

mixer circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a field effect 
transistor (FET) having two gate electrodes between its 
source and drain thereof, that is, a dual gate field effect 
transistor (dual gate FET). The invention is also directed 
to an amplifier circuit and a mixer circuit respectively 
using different embodiments of the dual gate field effect 
transistor. With the recent rapid development of information 
network systems, the demand for a satellite communications 
has also increased rapidly. There is a concurrent greater 
demand for the use of higher frequency bands. FETs, 
especially, MESFETs formed of GaAs have proven to be 
particularly useful in this regard. Their characteristics 
surpass those of traditional silicone bipolar transistors. FETs have proven to be particularly useful in 
variable gain amplifier circuits. The gain of the amplifier 
is a function of a voltage signal applied to a gate of the 
FET. Dual gate FETs are particularly useful in mixer 
circuits used for frequency conversion. It is known that the gain of an amplifier is 
proportional to a ratio, gm/gd, of its transmission 
conductance gm to its output conductance gd thereof. In  
 
general, the output conductance gd of a dual gate FET is 
smaller than that of a single gate FET. The gain of a dual 
gate FET amplifier can be made larger than of an amplifier 
using a single gate FET. Also, it is convenient to be able 
to apply an input signal to the first gate of a dual gate FET 
and a control voltage to the second gate that allows one to 
change the gain of the amplifier. Dual gate FETs are also convenient for use in a mixer 
circuit, such as, for example, a down-converter. A high 
frequency input signal can be input to one of the gates and a 
local oscillator signal can be input to the other gate. The 
two signals are mixed without need for extra circuitry for 
isolating the two inputs. Although dual gate FETs are effectively utilized as 
amplifiers and mixers, there are some problems still to be 
overcome. The use of a dual gate FET in a mixer requires the 
use of complicated biasing circuitry. The drain-source 
voltage associated with the first gate is narrower than the 
drain-source voltage associated with the second gate. The 
only way to get the FET to operate with a linear 
characteristic is to zero bias both the first and second 
gates. However, at zero bias, it is not possible to obtain 
sufficient gain. To cause the FET to be driven to saturation 
using only a single power source requires the use of a 
complicated bias
