<ABSTRACT>
In the removal of particulates from a wellbore, such as in air drilling for hydrocarbon recovery, a mixture of an amphoteric foaming agent and, typically, an anionic surfactant is employed. An aqueous solution thereof having a pH of at least 9.5 is used to generate a foam for removing the particulates; then the foam is collapsed by the introduction of acid to reduce the pH below about 4, the particles are removed mechanically, the pH is restored to greater than 9.5, and the foaming solution is returned to the wellbore. The solution may be used several times; partial losses of foaming agent in the process may be easily replenished with each cycle. Cationic surfactants may be used instead of anionic, with foaming and foam collapse being controlled at opposite pH's. Savings are realized in water, drilling chemicals, and settling pits and the like for removing particulates from the foam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to well drilling for
hydrocarbon recovery, and to the use of foam in well
cleaning, and especially to the use of foam for the
removal of particulate debris from wells through the
use of foam. It is particularly useful for removing
drilled material (cuttings) from the wellbore using
foam, in the process sometimes known as air foam
drilling. It provides a method and composition which
enable the recycling of foaming compositions in air
foam drilling and well cleaning with foams, resulting
in savings of foaming agents, at the same time making
unnecessary (or at least minimizing the necessity for)
the settling ponds and basins used previously to
dispose of the foam and foaming agents.It is well known to use foam to assist in the removal
of cuttings from wellbores during drilling in
hydrocarbon recovery from subterranean formations.
See Schramm and Gustafson, US Patent 3,130,798 and
Elman, Woodward and Sullivan, US Patent 3,297,098.
Foam may also be used as a workover fluid in cleaning
debris from existing oil and gas wells. The foam is
typically generated by the use of surfactants of
various kinds together with the injection down the
wellbore of air (or another gas such as nitrogen, CO2
or methane) under pressure. Responding to the
agitation and pressure of the gas during drilling, the
foam lifts the cuttings and/or other particulate
debris up through the wellbore; the foam and the 
cuttings must then be separated mechanically and/or
the foam/particulate mixture must be sent to a
settling pond or basin, creating either an
environmental problem or requiring an expensive vessel
to contain the foam/particulate mixture, or both. An
average drilling operation may generate one thousand
cubic feet of foam per minute as it expands in the
relatively low pressure of the wellhead. The
presence of foam makes the job of the mechanical
separator difficult; separators designed to handle
large quantities of foam tend to be large and
expensive, and also tend to require significant
amounts of attention. Settling ponds must be lined to
prevent seepage into the earth and their use is in any
event environmentally undesirable; for example, the
wind may blow the foam out of the ponds, carrying
various chemicals with it. Accordingly, while foaming
techniques for drilling employ less water than
conventional mud drilling, there is a need to employ
foam in a way which reduces the amount of water used,
and the volume of foam, and which ameliorates the
difficulties of disposal.Materials which generate foam in
