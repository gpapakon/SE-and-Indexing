<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to (3S,4S)-delta-6-tetrahydrocannabinol-7-oic
acids and homologs and
derivatives thereof, essentially free of the (3R,4R)
form, and to processes for their preparation. The
invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions
containing said compounds as active ingredients, having
anti-inflammatory, analgetic, leucocyte anti-adhesion,
antiplatelet activating factor (PAF), and anti-glaucoma
activities, as well as properties effective in
alleviating certain symptoms due to neuronal injury or
loss.The (3S,4S) enantiomers of cannabimimetically
active cannabinoids, such as the natural (3R,4R)-delta-1-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) are generally not
cannabimimetic. This lack of undesirable CNS side
effects makes them suitable candidates as therapeutic
agents. It has been previously shown that the (3S,4S)-7-hydroxy-delta-6-tetrahydrocannabinol
1,1-di-methylheptyl
homolog (compound la in the appended Figures) is an
analgetic, entiemetic and anti-NMDA drug [U.S. Patent
4,876,276 and co-pending Israel Patent Application No.
92238; Mechoulam, R., et al., Tetrahedron:Asymmetry, 1,
315(1990); Feigenbaum, J.J., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci., 86, 9584 (1989)]. It has also been shown that
(3R,4R)-delta-l-tetrahydrocannabinol-7-oic acid (compound
2), which also shows no psychotropic effects, is an anti-inflammatory
and analgetic compound [U.S. Patent
4,847,290]. However, the (3S,4S)-tetrahydrocannabinol-7-oic
acids have not yet been prepared and their
therapeutic activity has been unknown so far. These
compounds have now been synthesized and were found to
possess unexpected therapeutically important properties. The present invention relates to (3S,4S)-delta-6-tetrahydrocannabinol-7-oic
acids, homologs and
derivatives thereof having the general formula:

wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a C1-C5 alkyl group, R1 is
a hydrogen atom or a C1-C5 acyl group and R2 is selected
from the group consisting of: (a) a straight-chained or
branched C5- C-12 alkyl; (b) a group -O-R4, wherein R4 is
a straight-chained or branched C2-C9 alkyl which may be
substituted at the terminal carbon atom by a phenyl
group; and (c) a group -(CH2)n-O-alkyl, where n is an
integer of from 1 to 7 and the alkyl group contains from
1 to 5 carbon atoms,
with the exception of 6a,7,10,10a tetrahydro-6,6-dimethyl-9-carboxyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-olThe most preferred compounds are the 1,1-dimethylheptyl
(DMH) homologs of (3S,4S)-(+)-delta-6-tetrahydrocannabinol-7-oic
acid (hereafter designated HU-235,
