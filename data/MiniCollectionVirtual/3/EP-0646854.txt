<ABSTRACT>
A clock signal distribution circuit of a tree structure 
having a plurality of buffers (101-144;301-344) arranged in 

a plurality of hierarchal stages includes short-circuit 
wirings (161-164,171-194;361-364,371-394) for short-circuiting 

output terminals of the buffers at each stage of 
the plurality of hierarchal stages. Each of the plurality 

of buffers is formed by a single inverter or a multi-stage 
inverter wherein an input stage inverter (351) and an 

output stage inverter (352) are connected in series. The 
output stage inverter (352) has a size larger than that of 

the input stage inverter (351). The clock signal distribution 
circuit thus constructed can reduce clock skew and 

distribute a high frequency clock signal having sharp rise 
and fall characteristics to a plurality of registers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clock signal distribution
circuit that can distribute a high frequency clock signal
to a plurality of registers.To distribute a high frequency clock signal, the
reduction of clock skew and the increase of a driving
capability have previously been attempted. Several methods
of clock distribution have been known, such as follows:The first example is a tree structure driving method
represented by an H-Tree structure (for example, as disclosed
in "IEEE 1992 CUSTOM INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
CONFERENCE", 28.3.1 - 28.3.4) in which it is possible to
achieve a reduced clock skew by equalization of loads and
an increased driving capability by a hierarchal arrangement
of buffers.The second example is a large driver packaged driving
method (for example, as disclosed in "IEEE 1992 INTERNATIONAL
SOLID STATE CIRCUITS CONFERENCE", TA 6.2, pp. 106 -
107) in which it is possible to achieve the reduced skew by 
reducing a wire delay time by means of a low resistance
clock trunk line design, and to increase a driving capability
by means of a large driver. An inverter having a
simple structure and a large driving capability is utilized
as a buffer of the tree structure driving method. To
attain a large driving capability, the size of an inverter
is increased, and the number of branches in the tree structure
is reduced. A hierarchical structure made up of a
number of inverters is utilized as a driver of the large
driver packaged driving method.Moreover, as the third example of techniques for
reducing clock skew in the tree structure driving method,
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication
No. Hei-4(1992)-373160, short-circuiting of buffer
output terminals at the final stage of a distribution
circuit is also known. Fig. 1 shows such conventional
clock signal distribution circuit wherein the buffers of
the final stage are mutually connected or short-circuited
with each other. More specifically, this circuit is formed
by a buffer 401 of a first stage, buffers 402 - 405 of a
second stage, and buffers 411 - 414, 421 - 424, 431 - 434
and 441 - 444 of a third stage, and output terminals of all
the third stage buffers 411 - 444 are short-circuited by a
plurality of short-circuit wirings 471 - 494.However, the above mentioned conventional clock signal 
distribution circuits according to these methods have the
following drawbacks.Specifically, it is, in principle, impossible for the
large driver packaged driving method to realize zero skew
because there is a difference in distance from a
