<ABSTRACT>
Single-pole circuit breaker with high breaking power, in a moulded insulating box formed by two half-shells fitted together, having a sole fitting onto a standardised rail, a peak revealing an operating lever linked to a mechanism for controlling opening and closing of the circuit breaker, and two narrow lateral faces enclosing the connection terminals (6, 7), an electric circuit linking the said terminals and consisting of a bimetallic thermal disconnection strip (8), of a fork (3) including (at A, B) two moving contacts in series interacting with a pair of fixed contacts, which are placed on either side of a central partition bounding two arc cutoff chambers and supporting a magnetic disconnection assembly (9), the said cutoff chambers each accommodating a stack of anti-ion plates (10, 11), characterised in that it comprises at least one component forming a loop (C) extending transversely to the moulded box, situated symmetrically on either side of the central partition in the two cutoff chambers, and making it possible in each cutoff chamber to obtain a primary arc runner (20, 23) and a secondary arc runner (21, 22) which are placed parallel and at a short distance from one another.

Unipolar heavy-duty circuit breaker comprising, in a 
moulded insulating case (40) made of two nested half-shells 

presenting a flange (41) which fits on a standardised rail, a 
point revealing an operating lever connected to a control 

mechanism for opening and for closing the switch, and two 
narrow lateral faces enclosing the binding posts (6, 7), an 

electric circuit connecting the said posts and comprising a 
thermostatic cutoff bimetal (8), a fork (3) comprising (at A, 

B) two moving contacts in series which work in conjunction 
with a pair of fixed contacts, located on either side of a 

median partition (30) delimiting two arc quenching chambers 
(31, 32) and supporting a magnetic cutoff unit (9), the said 

cutoff chambers (31, 32) each housing a stack of deionized 
plates (10, 11), characterised in that it comprises at least 

one part forming a loop (C) extending transversally to the 
moulded case (40), situated symmetrically on either side of 

the median partition (30) in the two cutoff chambers (31, 32) 
and enabling to obtain in each cutoff chamber a primary arc 

conduction plate (20, 23) and a secondary arc conduction plate 
(21, 22) located in parallel and close to one another. 
Unipolar switch according to claim 1 characterised 
in that the said loop (C) comprising at least one part fits to 

the central partition (30) in such a way as to form a sub-assembly 
coherent with the elements comprising the arc cutoff 

chambers, the said sub-assembly being capable of being mounted 
in a single operation during the assembly of the switch. 
Unipolar switch according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the loop (C) comprises two parts (P
1
 P
2
) which overlap 
one another, each of these parts comprising a primary 

conduction plate (20, 23) of one of the cutoff chambers (31, 
32) and the secondary conduction plate (21, 22), with 

transversal connecting plates (24, 25) at the level of the 
contacts (A, B) and transversal plates (26, 27) close to the 

casing flange, designed to close the current loop (C). 
Unipolar switch according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the transversal connecting plates (24, 25) comprise 

steps permitting on the one hand their interlacing and on the  
 

other hand the distance between primary and secondary 
conduction plate (20, 21, 22, 23) of each arc quenching 

chamber (31, 32) to be fixed. 
Unipolar switch according to one of claims 3 and 4, 
characterised in that the transversal plates (26, 27) 

contiguous to the casing flange do not connect the two 
conduction plates (20, 21 ; 22, 23) of their respective part 

(P1, P2) but are in contact with one another in such a way as 
to close the current loop (C). 
Unipolar switch according to one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the two parts (P1, P2) have 

approximately the shape respectively of a q and of a p with 
rectangular body the shaft of which constitutes the primary 

conduction plate (20, 33) and the plate parallel to the shaft 
constitutes the secondary conduction plate (21, 22). 
Unipolar switch according to any one of the above-mentioned 
claims, characterised in that the contact pads of 

the moving and fixed contacts (A, B) are embedded in the 
plates which carry them in such a way as to not hinder the 

movement of the electric arc.
