<ABSTRACT>
This composition takes the form of mascara containing, mixed:   a) a pseudo-latex consisting of particles of a film-forming polymer containing carboxylic acid functions, having an average diameter of between 10 and 300 nm the carboxylic acid functions of the aforementioned polymer being neutralized to a degree of neutralization of between 10 and 80% using a non-volatile monobasic agent, the aforementioned agent being used alone, and the aforementioned pseudo-latex being present in a proportion between 0.8 and 20%, and preferably between 1 and 10%, by weight of dry matter relative to the total weight of the composition, and b) at least one wax having a melting point between 60 DEG C and 110 DEG C, and preferably between 65 DEG C and 100 DEG C, in a proportion between 2 and 40% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition.   The composition of the mascara enables an enhanced length and an attractive curvature to be imparted to the eyelashes.
