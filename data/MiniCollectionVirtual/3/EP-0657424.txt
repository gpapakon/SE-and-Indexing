<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the
manufacture of thioether compounds by reacting a
compound having a nucleophilic site with a thiol or
disulfide in the presence of a base and an oxidizing
agent.Thioether compounds are useful in many
industries including those related to pharmaceuticals,
agricultural chemicals, dyestuffs, and color
photography. In color photography using silver halidebased
light sensitive materials, a color image is
obtained by the reaction of a color image forming
coupler with the oxidation product of a color
developing agent. The oxidized developer is formed
upon development of exposed silver halide granules
present in a gelatin emulsion layer which also contains
the color image forming coupler. The two react to
generate the dye of which the color image is formed.
The color image forming materials (couplers) possess a
site that is activated toward reaction with oxidized
developer (the coupling site). It is common for
couplers to possess a leaving group (coupling-off
group) at the activated site. Couplers with such a
structure allow for the theoretical use of only two
moles of silver halide to generate one mole of dye and
are thus called two equivalent couplers. Couplers
without a coupling-off group are termed four equivalent
couplers since theoretically four moles of silver must
be used to obtain one mole of image-forming dye. In
practice, the reactions are far less efficient, and
much more than two or four equivalents is needed to
achieve the desired degree of dye formation in either 
instance. The coupling-off group itself, which may be
a photographically useful group (PUG), may serve a
function such as carrying out color correction,
assisting in the bleaching of unwanted silver,
contributing to sharpness, or otherwise providing
interimage effects. Another class of compounds that
couple with oxidized developer to release
photographically useful groups are those which form
either colorless species or dyes that are not retained
in the final image (U.S. 5,151,343) sometimes referred
to as "universal" couplers. Thiol coupling off groups
have been employed for all the above purposes and
couplers which release them are valuable tools for
obtaining desirable features in a photographic system.
(U.S. 4,556,630 and U.S. 4,853,319)A variety of methods exist for preparation of
these thioether materials. The most widely used
process is arylthiolation, and it consists of reacting
a coupler which contains one or two hydrogens at the
coupling site (a four equivalent coupler) with an
activate
