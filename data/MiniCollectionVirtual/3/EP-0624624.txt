<ABSTRACT>
A polyacetal resin composition which 
comprises (A) 100 parts by weight of a polyacetal 

resin, (B) 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight of at least one 
kind selected from the group of light stabilizers 

represented by the following formula (1) 

wherein two X's are the same or different and each 
denotes a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, 

(C) 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight of an ultraviolet light 
absorber, (D) 0.1 to 3 parts by weight of polyethylene, 

(E) 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of polyethylene glycol, 
and (F) 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a polymer of a 

methacrylate ester. This polyacetal resin composition 
is excellent in weather resistance and molding 

processability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel polyacetal
resin composition. More specifically, this invention
relates to a novel polyacetal resin composition which
is excellent in weather resistance and molding
processability.Polyacetal resins are excellent in physical
properties such as abrasion resistance, wear
resistance, fatigue resistance, heat resistance, and
electric properties and chemical properties such as
chemical resistance and water resistance. Accordingly,
the polyacetal resins have been used in electric and
electronic fields and a field of building construction.
Besides, they have found wide application in parts,
etc. in fields of automobile industry, misceraneous
goods, and so forth.However, molded articles formed of the
polyacetal resins are known to be inferior in weather
resistance. That is, it is known that when such molded
articles are exposed to sunlight or indoor lighting for
a long time and further to wind and rain, cracks occur
on the surfaces of the molded articles, and as
occurrence of the cracks proceeds, gloss is lost, the
appearance deteriorates, and mechanical properties
notably decrease.It is an object of this invention to provide
a novel polyacetal resin composition.A particular object of this invention is to
provide a polyacetal resin composition which is
excellent in weather resistance (light resistance). Another object of this invention is to
provide such a polyacetal resin composition that when
the components of the polyacetal resin composition are
extruded, while being melt-kneaded, into strands with
an extruder to pelletize the polyacetal resin
composition, occurrence of a gum-like resin substance
at an extrusion die and occurrence of surging can be
substantially suppressed.Still another object of this invention is to
provide a polyacetal resin composition which can give
an injection-molded article with beautiful surface
finish and substantially without occurrence of a flow
mark.A further object of this invention is to
provide a polyacetal resin composition in which
additives that are added to a polyacetal resin are
substantially restrained from bleeding out on a surface
of a molded article.A still further object of this invention is
to provide a molded article of a polyacetal resin
composition which is excellent in weather resistance,
which is substantially free from a flow mark and on
which surface additives substantially do not bleed out.In accordance with this invention, there is
provided a polyacetal resin composition which
comprises:
(A) 100 parts by weight of a

<CLAIMS>
A polyacetal resin composition which comprises:

(A) 100 parts by weight of a polyacetal resin,
(B) 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight of at least one kind
selected from the group of light stabilizers represented by

the following formula (1)


wherein two X's are the same or different and each
denotes a hydrogen atom or a methyl group,
(C) 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight of an ultraviolet light
absorber which is at least one compound selected from the

group consisting of a compound having a benzotriazole
skeleton, a compound having a benzophenone skeleton, a

compound having a salicylate skeleton, a compound having an
α-cyanoacrylate skeleton and a compound having an oxalic

acid anilide skeleton,
(D) 0.1 to 3 parts by weight of polyethylene,
(E) 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of polyethylene glycol,
and
(F) 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a polymer of a
methacrylate ester.
The polyacetal resin composition of claim 1 which is
prepared by uniformly kneading the components (A) to (F)

while melting the component (A).
The polyacetal resin composition of claim 1 wherein the
polymer (F) of the methacrylic acid ester is at least one

polymer selected from the group 
consisting of a homopolymer of the methacrylate ester

and a copolymer of the methacrylate ester as the main
component and the other monomer.
An article which is formed by injection-molding
the polyacetal resin composition of claim 1.
The article of claim 4 wherein in a surface
layer that is up to at least 100 µm from the surface of

the molded article, polyethylene (D), polyethylene
glycol (E) and the polymer (F) of the methacrylate

ester form fine mixed crystals with the polyacetal
resin (A) and an oriented bell-like spherulite layer of

the polyacetal resin disappears.
Use of the polyacetal resin composition of
claim 1 as an injection-molding resin.
