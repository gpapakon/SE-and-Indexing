<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a two-stage exhaust gas 
conversion catalyst system comprising a first stage reducing 
catalyst and a second stage oxidative catalyst. A number of catalysts have been suggested to convert 
automotive exhaust gas components like carbon monoxide, 
hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides into other gases. The 
nitrogen oxides present in the exhaust gas are nitric oxide 
(NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), both generally referred to 
by the formula NOx. Present simultaneous control of the 
three components, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and 
hydrocarbons, is by so-called "three-way" catalysts like 
platinum/rhodium and palladium/rhodium. These catalysts 
operate properly when the fuel mixture of a gasoline engine 
is slightly "rich" and the environment is a reducing 
atmosphere, i.e., in a narrow A/F ratio range between about 
14.7 and 14.4. Such three-way catalysts are less than 
efficient in the reduction of NOx when engines are operated 
on the lean side where the A/F ratio is greater than 14.7. 
It is desirable, however, to operate engines on the lean 
side to realise a benefit in fuel economy, estimated to be 
in the range of 5-7%. U.S. -A- 4,297,328 discloses a copper- containing 
high-silica zeolite described as being useful as a three-way 
catalyst to reduce preferentially oxides of nitrogen to N₂ 
on the "lean" side of the A/F (air/fuel) mixture. High-silica 
zeolites are described as those preferably above 20. Copper-containing zeolites are prone to degradation at 
the high temperatures found in automobile exhaust systems. 
That is, the copper tends to react with the alumina of the 
zeolite and form copper aluminate which is a low surface 
area compound with reduced catalytic activity. The invention overcomes problems associated with prior 
art catalysts and is directed to a two-stage exhaust gas 
conversion catalyst system for purification of exhaust  
 
gases containing nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and 
hydrocarbons. The exhaust gas may be automobile exhaust gas 
and the invention is adapted to be useful in lean-burn 
situations, i.e, with oxygen rich environments. The system 
comprises a first stage catalyst and a second stage 
catalyst. The first stage catalyst is a combination of (i) 
refractory oxide impregnated with transition metal (ii) and 
transition metal-containing zeolite. The refractory oxide 
is selected from the group consisting essentially of 
zirconia, silica, titania and lanthana. The second stage 
catalyst is an oxidizing catalyst such as a noble
