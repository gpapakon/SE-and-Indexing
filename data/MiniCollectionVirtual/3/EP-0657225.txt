<CLAIMS>
Protective mask for an automobile vehicle 
during painting operations, characterised in that 

it consists of a resiliently deformable rod (2) on 
which a curtain (1) is suspended, this rod being 

curved or folded, and has dimensions such that it 
may be placed against the bodywork (3), on the 

internal circumference of a wheel housing (4) of 
the vehicle. 
Mask according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the resiliently deformable rod (2) is 

curved in the general shape of a U and is integral 
with a part (7) which extends laterally in the 

plane (X-X) of the rod, this part having 
dimensions such that it may bear on the external 

face of the wheel (6) of the vehicle. 
Mask according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the rod (2) and the part (7) are curved 

and folded to define, together, a structure in the 
general form of a crescent, the internal edge (7) 

of which is offset from the plane formed by the 
outer edge (2). 
Mask according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the inner edge (7) of the structure which  

 
is in the shape of a crescent is oblique in 

relation to a plane (X-X) of the outer edge (2).
