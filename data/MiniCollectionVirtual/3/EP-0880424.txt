<ABSTRACT>
A method of wet-grinding a surface, particularly a floor comprised of stone or stone-like material, wherein liquid is delivered to the area of contact between a grinding tool and the grinding surface, wherein liquid-bound particulate solids are withdrawn from the grinding area by suction and filtered to extract the particulate solids from the liquid, and wherein the liquid filtrate is returned to the tool grinding area. The grinding tool (2) is encircled by a skirt (3) whose rim seals against the surface (30). The flow of liquid and solids is led to one or to a few of a plurality of filter bags (11) and the liquid/solids flow is switched to a fresh bag (11) or to a fresh group of bags (11) when a previous bag or previous group of bags has been filled, wherein the previous bag or group of bags is isolated from the flow (5) and left for the liquid to drain gravitationally therefrom as the fresh bags are being filled. The bags are removed and sealed when liquid no longer runs from the bags.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD AND A DEVICE FOR WET-GRINDING OF A FLOORThe present invention relates to a floor wet-grinding method of the kind defined in the preamble of the following independent method Claim.The invention also relates to floor wet-grinding apparatus of the kind defined in the preamble of the following apparatus Claim.Thus, the invention relates to a wet-grinding method, preferably for wet-grinding of floors, particularly stone floors or floors comprised of a stone-like material, with the aid of a grinding tool, wherein liquid is delivered to the tool grinding area and a resultant mixture of particulate solids and liquid is sucked away and passed to filtering equipment in which the particulate material i.e. solids, is separated from the mixture and the liquid returned to the region of the grinding tool (EP-A1-0 549 202).US-A-3,701,221 teaches a dry grinding machine for grinding terrazzo floors, said machine being coupled to a vacuum cleaner that separates the solids .Wet-grinding is the only usable method in practice for grinding floors that are made of stone or stone-like material.According to the known technique for wet-grinding floors, a stream of water is delivered to the working area of the grinding tool and it is endeavoured to transport the resultant mixture of liquid (water) and solids to a 

collecting container that lies far away from the grinding area. For instance, it has been attempted to absorb the liquid with sawdust or the like upon completion of a working operation, and then shovel-up the wet sawdust and solids and carry the same to a container. This mixture of water and solids (and sawdust) in the container constitutes a serious dumping problem. Large quantities of water are involved and the container therefore quickly becomes very heavy. This water cannot simply be emptied into the sewage system, because it contains substantial quantities of suspended solids.Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus that will enable the suspended solids to be separated by suction from a liquid/solids suspension, so as to enable the solids to be dumped as dry waste and the liquid to be recycled to the grinding machine.This object is achieved by the inventive method according to the following Claim 1.Further developments of the method are set forth in the dependent method Claims.The aforesaid object is also achieved with an inventive apparatus according to the independent apparatus Claim.Further developments of the inventive apparatus are set forth in the dependent

CLAIMS
1. A method of wet-grinding a surface, particularly a floor made of stone or stone-like material, wherein liquid is delivered to the area of contact between a grinding tool and a grinding surface, wherein a mixture of liquid and particulate solids is removed from the grinding area by suction and filtered to extract solids from the mixture, and wherein the filtered liquid is returned to the tool grinding area, characterized in that the grinding tool (2) is encircled by a skirt (3) whose rim seals against said surface (30); in that a flow of liquid and solids is led from the skirt to one or more filter bags in a filter-bag array that includes a plurality of filter bags (11); in that the flow (5) of liquid and solids is switched to a fresh bag (11) or to a fresh group of bags (11) in said array of bags when the preceding bag or groups of bags has/have been filled, wherein the previously filled bag or groups of bags is/are isolated from the flow (5) and left so that liquid present therein will filter therethrough gravimetrically as the fresh bags are being filled; and in that the bags are removed and sealed when liquid no longer runs from said bags.
2. A method according to Claim 1, characterized by filtering the filtrate from said bags in a further separating filter (17, 19) prior to said filtrate being caught in a collecting container (12), from which the liquid is returned to said skirt interior(3).
3. A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized by placing the bags (11) in a vacuum chamber (50) so that the 


subpressure in said vacuum chamber will suck the flow via those bags that communicate with said skirt interior (3 ) .
4. Apparatus for wet-grinding a surface, such as a floor made of stone material or stone-like material, wherein liquid is delivered to the grinding area of a grinding tool (2), wherein said apparatus includes means (4, 12, 14) for transporting a liquid flow from a liquid storage means to the grinding area of said tool (2), means (5-9) for drawing a mixture of liquid and particulate solids by suction from the tool grinding area to a filter means (11) from which the liquid filtrate is returned to the liquid storage means, characterized in that the grinding tool (2) is encircled by a skirt (3) whose rim seals against the grinding surface (30); in that the liquid flow is delivered to the interior space defined by said skirt (3); in that the mixture of liquid and particulate solids is removed by suction from the area inwards of the skirt (3); in that the filter means includes a plurality of filter bags (11), means (7, 8, 9, 27, 10) for leading the flow of liquid and solids to solely one or a few of the total number of bags (11), wherein filled bags (11) drain of liquid gravimetrically while being isolated from the flow of water and solids that passes to one or more other bags (11).
5. Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized by a collecting tray (16) having filter means (17) for capturing the filtrate leaving the bags (11).
6. Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized by a secondary filter means (18) having a filter medium (19) for 


filtering said filtrate prior to passing said filtrate to the collecting container (12).
7. Apparatus according to any one of Claims 4-6, characterized in that by a wheel-mounted trolley (29) which carries the bags (11) and filtrate collecting trays (16, 18) and the container (12) for re-circulation liquid.
8. Apparatus according to any one of Claims 4-7, characterized in that the filter bags are placed in a vacuum chamber (50) so that the flow of liquid and particulate solids can be drawn by suction from the skirt (3 ) into the bags that communicate therewith.
