<ABSTRACT>
A polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) drag bit 
cutter insert 32 provides more clearance between the 

cutter insert's drilling edge and the drag bit body 
mounting blade 30. This allows for more efficient 

hydraulic cooling and cleaning of the cutters, thereby 
achieving faster drilling rates. A cutter insert has a 

cylindrical carbide cutter base end 38 and an off-set 
asymmetric diamond cutting end 41. The cylindrical base 

38 is substantially completely embedded in the blade. The 
asymmetrical cutter insert provides for less interference 

of the bit head surfaces and the rock formation being 
drilled, thereby reducing detrimental heat and also 

allowing a greater depth of penetration of the cutter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diamond drag bits.
More particularly, this invention relates to diamond
cutting elements for diamond drag bits.Polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDC) are used
extensively for cutters on drag bits for drilling soft to
medium earthen formations in petroleum and mining
exploration. One of the most common type PDC cutters used
in diamond drag bits for drilling predominately ductile,
medium strength formations is a cylinder type. A cylinder
type PDC comprises a right cylinder tungsten carbide body
with a thin layer (approximately 0.7 to 1 mm) of
polycrystalline diamond chemically and metallurgically
bonded to an end face of the cylinder using a high
pressure/high temperature (HP/HT) sintering process.Although cylindrical PDC type cutters serve a
very useful purpose in drilling, there may be
disadvantages in their use for certain applications.
Typically, a cylinder type PDC cutter is fixedly mounted,
by brazing, in a socket formed on the outer surface of a
blade fabricated on the drilling face of a drag bit. The
diamond face of the cutter is oriented substantially
parallel to a radius of the borehole being drilled. The
PDC cutter is positioned with back rake and heel clearance
for the diamond cutting face by tilting the trailing end
of the cutter body upward in relation to the borehole
bottom.For drilling many ductile rock formations,
presently used PDC cylinder cutters do not have the
necessary clearance from the diamond cutting edge to the
supporting blade outer surface paralleling the formation
bottom. Therefore, the displaced rock formation
interferes with the aforementioned blade outer surface and
greatly retards the drilling rate.Also, because of the limited stand-off of the 
current diamond cutters from the blade surface,
sufficient cooling and cleaning of the cutter often is
not accomplished. This is because the entire exposed
portion of the cutter is indented into the ductile rock
leaving no room for the drilling fluid to flush across
the cutter face.Because of the relatively small exposure of the
diamond cutting face of the prior art cutters, the
drilling life of the bit is limited to the amount of wear
the cutter can experience before the rock formation
continuously bears on the insert supporting blade outer
surface, effectively stopping the drilling process. This
wear amount is normally somewhat less than one-half the
cutter diameter.Normally, prior art cylindrical PDC cutters only
have approximately one half of the cutter body surface
area brazed into the socket on the
