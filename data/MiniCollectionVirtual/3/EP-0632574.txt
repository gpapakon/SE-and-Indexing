<ABSTRACT>
A digital waveform synthesizer (10) comprises a direct 
digital synthesizer (12) for providing a digitally synthesized 

input frequency signal. Further provided is a reference frequency 
generator (25) for providing clock and predetermined frequency 

reference signals. An upconverter and divider circuit (18, 18a) 
is coupled to the direct digital synthesizer (12) for upconverting 

and dividing the synthesized input frequency signal to 
provide a divided synthesized frequency signal. Said upconverter 

and divider circuit (18, 18a) comprises a mixer (14) having 
an input coupled to the direct digital synthesizer (12) for 

receiving the synthesized input frequency signal, and having 
a second input coupled to the reference signal generator (25) 

for receiving a first predetermined reference frequency signal; 
a bandpass filter (15) coupled to the mixer (14), a divide by 

N divider circuit (16), where N is the divide number, coupled 
to the bandpass filter (15); and a low pass filter (17) coupled 

to the divide by N divider circuit (16). An output upconverter 
circuit (21) is coupled to the upconverter and divider circuit 

(18, 18a) and to the reference frequency generator (25) for 
upconverting the divided synthesized frequency signal to provide 

a desired upconverter synthesized output frequency signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to waveform synthesizers, and more 
particularly, to a digital waveform synthesizer that employs a direct digital synthesizer 
and digital frequency dividers. An existing variable frequency oscillator (VFO) uses a combination of indirect 
frequency synthesis (phase lock loop frequency synthesizer) to provide frequency 
upconversion and multiplication, and a direct digital synthesizer using a triangular 
waveform to generate very fine frequency steps. The use of the phase lock loop 
synthesizer with very narrow bandwidth limits the switching speed performance of the 
this design. In addition, the phase lock loop scheme uses programmable feedback 
dividers that degrade the noise (and spurious signal) performance inside the phase lock 
loop bandwidth by a factor of 20*log(N), where N is the divider ratio, over the noise 
floor of both the frequency divider and the direct digital synthesizer. The phase lock 
loop also adds a noise hump near its loop bandwidth. Finally, the triangular waveform 
used in the direct digital synthesizer generates a higher spur level compared to 
commercially available direct digital synthesizers that generate a sinusoidal waveform. The linear frequency modulated (FM) waveform for use in frequency modulated 
ranging (FMR) is generated by applying a linear voltage ramp derived from a linear 
voltage ramp generator to a voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO). The output of 
the VCXO is frequency multiplied to X-band to provide maximum usable linear FM 
bandwidth of 100 KHz. The linearity and the slope accuracy is limited by the linearity 
of the VCXO and the accuracy of the voltage ramp generator. The slope accuracy is  
 
increased but at a cost of using multi-unit level calibration and a microwave calibration 
target source. Also, the VCXO requires approximately 1 KHz of linear frequency 
tuning which may be achieved by degrading its FM noise performance. Accordingly it is an objective of the present invention to provide a direct digital 
synthesizer that overcomes the limitations of the above-described conventional waveform 
synthesizers. In particular, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a 
direct digital synthesizer that provides fast switching, flexible and precisely defined 
signals, and that improves the inherently poor spurious signal performance of its direct 
digital synthesizer. There are many advantages in using a direct digital synthesizer in a frequency 
synthesizer, but a primary disadvantage thereof
