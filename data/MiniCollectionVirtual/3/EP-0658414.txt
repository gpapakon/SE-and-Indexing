<ABSTRACT>
A twin screw extruder (10) and torque splitting 
transmission (12) has two output shaft portions that are 

axilly spaced apart a distance (dt) and are connected to 
elongate shafts (56,58) where at least one is bent along its 

length and powered by a driven pinion gear that has a 
diameter that is greater than the distance between the 

axes of the twin screws (16,18).

<DESCRIPTION>
One aspect of the invention relates to twin screw
mixer/extruders, but more particularly, another aspect of
the invention relates to a torque splitting transmission.The relatively small distance required between the
axes of the screw shafts of a twin screw extruder has
historically limited the diameters of final drive pinion
gears of a torque splitting transmission for driving the
closely spaced twin screws. The pinion gear size is
limited as a function of the center distance between the
shafts. In one extreme, the diameter of the driven
pinion gears cannot be greater than the distance between
two co-rotating shafts. In another extreme where the
drive gear pinions are axially offset from the other,
one of the pinion gears cannot have a radius that is
greater than the difference between the distance between
the shafts and the radius of one shaft.Unfortunately, the torque capacity of a gear varies
with the cube of its diameter and the small diameter of
the pinion gear(s) is a limiting factor of the torque
that can be delivered to the twin screws whose torque
capacity is typically greater than the torque capacity of
the pinion gear(s). In operation, twin screws generate
an axial force that is carried as a thrust load into the
torque splitting transmission. There are several prior
art solutions to enhance the torque limitations
associated with a small diameter pinion gear and bearing
loads induced by the pinion gear and twin screws.The techniques for enhancing the torque capacity of
torque splitting transmissions with closely spaced output
shafts involve avoiding overloading relatively small
teeth of the pinion gear. For example, the output torque
capability of a transmission may be enhanced by using
helical gears instead of spur gears for the pinion gear
to increase the number of teeth in contact with each 
other such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,261,225.
Another way of avoiding overloading the pinion gear teeth
and enhancing torque output capability using spur gears, is
to use planetary gearing to engage two teeth of spur type
pinion gears as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,824,875.
Another gear arrangement involving spur teeth pinion gears
is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,315,440 where two teeth of the
pinion gear are in contact with other spur gears for the
purpose of halving the tooth loading to the small diameter
pinion gear. A way of insuring that the tooth loading is
proportionately shared between two teeth of a pinion gear
is shown in the elaborate arrangement of gearing disclosed
in U.S.
