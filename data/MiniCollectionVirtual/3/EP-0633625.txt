<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an electric socket contact for insertion into a 
socket housing with a sleeve body and a laminated cage, which is 

attached axially to said sleeve body, for the displaceably 
pressing reception of a contact pin and attachment means, which 

are designed at the sleeve body, e.g. crimp extensions for 
connecting leads, there are for the purpose of making early 

contact and a reliable central guide of the contact pin the 
laminated cage (4), which is formed by a cylindrically rolled 

flat sheet metal blank (6), which exhibits a cylindrical base 
member (7) with two contact tongues (8), which are punched 

diametrically to each other and which are bent into the laminated 
cage in the direction of the free end and then are bent back 

toward the outside; and a cylindrical annular member (9) reaches 
at a distance over the free ends (8') near the plug opening (13); 

and wherein at a distance there are strip elements (14), which 
are connected rigidly to the annular member (9) and the base 

member (7) next to the contact tongues (8) and which exhibit 
depressions (10), hollows or the like, which point in the 

direction of the center longitudinal axis of the laminated cage, 
as mechanical guide members for the contact pin (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric socket contact for insertion
into a socket housing with a sleeve body and a laminated cage,
which is attached axially to said sleeve body, for the
displaceably pressing reception of a contact pin and attachment
means, which are designed at the sleeve body, e.g. crimp
extensions for connecting leads; (see EP-A-0 476 848).In the case of a socket contact (e.g. DE-A- 35 31 845) it is
well-known to insert a laminated cage so as to be fixed axially
in order to improve the contact in a sleeve body of the socket
contact. The ends of the strip-shaped lamellas of the laminated
cage are attached to annular strips and their length is bent in
the direction of the center longitudinal axis of the laminated
cage. When a contact pin is inserted into the laminated cage, the
laminated cage allows only relatively late contacts and is not
suited for preventing the contact pin from tilting and
wobbling.The object of the invention is to cause for a socket contact of
the above class the contacts near the plug opening and to provide
a reliable central guide for the contact pin in the laminated
cage.This problem is solved according to the invention as claimed in that the
laminated cage is formed by a cylindrically rolled flat sheet 
metal blank, which exhibits a cylindrical base member with two
contact tongues, which are punched diametrically opposed to each other,
The contact songues having free ends on the plug opening side of the sleeve body which are bent into the laminated cage in the direction of
the free ends and then are bent back toward the outside; and
a cylindrical annular member (9) reaches at a distance over the
free ends (8') near the plug opening (13); and that at a distance
there are strip elements, which are connected rigidly to the
annular member and the base member next to the contact tongues
and which exhibit depressions, hollows or the like, which point
in the direction of the center longitudinal axis of the laminated
cage, as mechanical guide members for the contact pin. Thus, it
is guaranteed that the contact between contact pin and socket
contact are caused essentially with the start of the plugging
operation; and upon insertion of the contact pin said contact pin
is prevented from tilting motions and wobbling motions due to the
interaction with the depressions in the laminated cage. The early
contacts produced during the insertion operation make the socket
contact especially suitable, e.g., for use between a generator
and an electronic controlling device for

<CLAIMS>
Electric socket contact for insertion into a socket housing with a sleeve
body and a laminated cage, which is attached axially to said sleeve body,

for the reception of a contact pin (11), the sleeve body being provided with

attachment means such as crimp extensions for connecting leads;
the laminated cage (4) being formed by a cylindrically rolled flat sheet

metal blank (6) which exhibits a cylindrical base member (7) with:

two contact tongues (8) punched diametrically opposed to each other, the
contact tongues having free ends (8') on the plug opening side of the

sleeve body and being bent into the laminated cage in the direction of the
free ends and then bent back toward the outside;
a cylindrical annular member (9) at a distance from the free ends (8') of
the contact tongues near the plug opening (13);
strip elements (14) spaced from the contact tongues, connected rigidly to
the annular member (9) and the base member (7) next to the contact

tongues (8) and provided with depressions (10) in the direction of the
longitudinal axis of the laminated cage;

wherein both the two contact tongues and the depressions are designed to be
in early contact with the contact pin (11) upon insertion of the contact pin

and wherein the laminated cage (4) is axially maintained between a bend (5)
of the sleeve body (1) and a fold (1') of the free end of the sleeve body

reaching clampingly over the outer end of the annular member (9) of said
cage. 
Socket contact according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the entire length of the contact tongues (8) is 
designed with the same width in the longitudinal direction.
Socket contact according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the contact tongues (8) are designed with a
width that decreases in the direction of the free end

(8') in the longitudinal direction.
Socket contact according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the contact tongues (8) are designed with a
width that decreases in the direction of the free end

(8') and are defined in the longitudinal direction by
means of side faces extending asymmetrically to each

other.
Socket contact according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the depressions (10) extend
essentially over the entire length of the spring tongues

(8) so as to project into the laminated cage (4).
