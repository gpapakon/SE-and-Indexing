<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the field of
detecting gingivitis and periodontal disease and, more
particularly to an apparatus for measuring the
concentration of sulfides within a periodontal pocket to
determine the presence and extent of gingivitis and
periodontal disease.Gingivitis and periodontal disease are, broadly
speaking, diseases which causes inflammation of the gum
area surrounding a tooth. They are thought to be caused by
the activity of Gram-negative anaerobic organisms. Early
symptoms include redness of the gingival margin surrounding
the tooth, slight edema or slight retractability of this
margin, and slight or delayed bleeding on probing of the
margin. If left unchecked, gingivitis and periodontal
disease may cause further and severe retraction of the
gingival margin, continuous and/or spontaneous bleeding,
and, even, eventual loss of the tooth due to the erosion of
the supporting and investing structures surrounding the
tooth, including the gums, cementum, periodontal membranes
and alveolar bone, even though the tooth itself, may be
perfectly healthy. It is thought that, in the United 
States each year, more teeth are lost to gingivitis and
periodontal disease than to disease and decay within the
tooth, itself.Typically, the presence of gingivitis and
periodontal disease enlarge the periodontal pocket or
gingival sulcus of the affected tooth. The gingival sulci
are the spaces or pockets between the gingival tissue
(gums) and the teeth. Many experts in the field are of
the belief that there is a correlation between the depth of
a periodontal pocket and the severity of the disease. The
depth of the periodontal pocket is usually measured from
the margin or top of the gum to the epithelial attachment,
the point where the gum attaches to the tooth. It is
measured with a mechanical probe. However, other experts
doubt the reliability of this correlation since the
gingival margins of some patients may exhibit fairly deep
pockets, and yet the patients have little or no active
periodontal disease within said pockets. In some cases,
disease may have been present in the past, but the
organisms which cause the disease may no longer be present
in the pocket.From a treatment standpoint, it is important to
know whether active periodontal disease is occurring within
a periodontal pocket, and, if so, how severe the disease
is. Hence, because even deep periodontal pockets do not
necessarily correlate with the presence of active
periodontal disease, merely measuring the depth of the
pocket does not

<CLAIMS>
A probe (10) suitable for diagnosing the presence and
extent of disease in a periodontal pocket containing sulcal fluid

by measuring the concentration of sulfides in said fluid therein,
said probe (10) comprising:


a housing (12) having a length and diameter suitably
configured to be easily handled and manipulated in the mouth of

a patient;
a tip (14) suitably configured to probe a periodontal
pocket, said tip (14) being disposed at a first end of said

housing (12) ; 
characterised in that
 said probe further comprises: 

a pair of electrodes including a first uncoated silver
electrode (16) and a second, reference silver electrode (18)

having a silver chloride coating deposited thereon, each of said
pair of electrodes (16, 18) having a surface portion at least

partially exposed in said tip (14) for contact with sulcal fluid
contained within a periodontal pocket to generate an electrical

potential difference between said electrodes (16, 18) as a
function of the sulfide concentration of said sulcal fluid; and
first and second electrical leads (22, 20) in communication
with, respectively, said first and second electrodes (16, 18).
The probe (100) of claim 1 wherein said housing comprises
a suitable length of double bore, bifilar polymeric tubing (112),

and each of said first and second electrodes (116, 118) is formed
of a suitable length of silver wire extending through a bore of

said bifilar tubing (112).
The probe of claim 2 further comprising a potting
material disposed in both bores (114) of the bifilar tubing

(112) to surround and support said pair of silver wires.
The probe of claim 2 further comprising means for
stiffening each bore of the bifilar polymeric tubing (112).
The probe of claim 1 wherein said housing (12) further
comprises a suitable length of metal tubing (24), said first

electrode (16) comprises a layer of silver plated onto 
portions of said tubing, and said second electrode (18) comprise

a chloride coated silver body disposed outside said housing (12) .
The probe of claim 5 further comprising polymeric
tubing (30) enclosing and surrounding said metal housing (24),

with a portion of said silver layer remaining exposed and
uncovered by said polymeric tubing (30) at the tip of said probe.
