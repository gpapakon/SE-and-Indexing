<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for treating sewage sludge by mixing a partially dewatered, stabilised sewage sludge with a mineral raw material. In order to treat sewage sludge to give a higher-quality, compostable secondary raw material, it is provided that a granular mineral raw material is used which has a clay mineral content and which is mixed together with a filler loosening texture and sewage sludge to give an at least coarsely homogeneous mixture, the duration of the mixing operation being chosen so that there is substantial cation exchange from sewage sludge to clay minerals and the mixture obtained is transferred to an aerobic reaction for composting.
