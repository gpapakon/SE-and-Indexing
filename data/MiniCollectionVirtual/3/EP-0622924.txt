<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided which permits mobile
computers equipped with modems for cellular telephone

systems to obtain various classes of data communication
services, as well as voice service, including taking part

in local-area networks. The LAN's may be composed of
real LANs in establishments or of other mobile computers.

In this way, mobile computers can take part in mainstream
client-server computing and also establish ad hoc

wireless LANs using the cellular telephone system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to data communications, and in particular to wireless networks. Specifically, the invention is directed to providing mobile computers with modems for cellular telephone systems the ability to obtain various classes of data communication services, voice service, and the capability to take part in Local Area Networks (LAN's).The acronyms below are used in the following description.CCCell ControllerISDNIntegrated Services Digital NetworkLANLocal-Area NetworkLLCLogical Link ControlMACMedia-Access ControlMDSCMobile Data Service ControllerMTSOMobile Telephone Service OfficePCPersonal ComputerPHYSPhysicalPSTNPublic Switched Telephone NetworkMSMobile StationWABWide-Area BridgeWANWide-Area NetworkWSWorkstationNMNetwork ManagerNCNetwork ControllerThe strongest growth area for PCs (and soon for WSs) is in portable systems, where unit shipments are projected to exceed 25 million per year by 1995. Portability generally implies untethered use and various vendors have begun to develop "wireless LAN access" products. These are based on both RF and infrared, and aim to provide within buildings a high bandwidth wireless connection to a backbone LAN, thus enabling the portables to continue to take part in LAN-based computing.Client-server and peer-to-peer applications which are widely available for PCs and WSs are written on the assumption of access within the PC or WS to one of a small number of communication protocol stacks, which in turn operate with one of a small number of physical layers. Standardization in this area has been highly successful and end-users are accustomed to buying 'shrink-wrap' software packages with network applications and installing them on their PCs.It seems equally desirable that portables retain LAN-access when they leave the establishment. The most accessible networks for wire-area communication are the public telephone networks. However the primary service offered for PC data by telephones is a serial line connection, which still leaves the PC tethered. By connecting a 2400 Baud modem to a cellular telephone set, a mobile serial line connection can be obtained, but the quality of service is extremely poor. Future digital cellular and cordless telephone systems will offer bandwidths around 8 kbps in the near-term, rising to ISDN basic service (144 kbps) by 2000 (RACE UMTS). (Private wireless wide-area networks such as ARDIS do provide computer network connectivity. However, the protocols available are relevant primarily for mainframe connectivity (LU6.2), and
