<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
electrodes or other electrically conductive elements, and 
particularly electrodes of complex shape, for example 
electrodes for metalworking processes such as electrical 
discharge machining (EDM) and electrochemical machining 
(ECM). Two most popular electro-machining processes are 
electrical discharge machining (EDM) and electrochemical 
machining (ECM). Electrodes for EDM and ECM are themselves 
usually machined from conductive materials such as copper or 
graphite. Since the shape of the electrode, or at least of 
the working (active) portion thereof, must correspond to the 
geometry of the EDM or ECM-machined part, the electrode 
manufacturing process can be time consuming depending on the 
complexity of the shape of the part. Thus far, complex 
electrodes can take a number of days to manufacture, even 
using numerically controlled (NC) machines. A review of known 
techniques for the forming of EDM electrodes is given in a 
paper by R. Gilmore, EDM Electrode Forming, Society of 
Manufacturing Engineers, Document MR92-354 (1992), and also in 
a paper by O. Rosenholm, Methods of Manufacturing Electrodes, 
SME Document MR92-350 (1992). During electrical discharge machining, electrodes are 
subject to wear. Therefore, electrode life and cost are  
 
significant factors in the EDM processes. By comparison, ECM 
processes do not cause any significant cathode wear since they 
rely on electrochemical dissolution of the part being 
machined. However, it is found frequently that the shape of 
the part produced should be modified and so should be, 
correspondingly, the cathode. A modification of the cathode 
could also be necessitated by disturbances in the electrolyte 
or variations in current density. In such cases, trial and 
error methods are used to modify or remake the electrodes. 
Even with the advent of computer aided design, measuring and 
feedback techniques to assist in effecting the modifications, 
the electrode machining still requires time, skill and 
considerable care to carry out, and even the best systems 
involve several iterations. According to the invention, there is provided a method of 
manufacturing an electrically conductive element, the method 
comprising the steps of:
 
   providing a digital representation of at least a 
working portion of the conductive element,
 
   forming a three-dimensional solid replica of the 
element or its portion from the digital representation, and
 
   applying a layer of electrically conductive
