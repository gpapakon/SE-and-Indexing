 PEPTIDES CORRESPONDING TO ANTIGENIC DETERMINANTS OF HTLVBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Technical FieldThe present invention relates, in general, to immunogenic preparations and, in particular, to synthetic peptides having amino acid sequences corresponding to antigenic determinants of the envelope proteins of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I or II, and immunogenic compositions comprising same.2. Background InformationHTLV-1 and -II are exogenous, naturally occurring human retroviruses that preferentially infect thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes. HTLV-1 and - II are causative agents of adult T-cell leukemias and lymphomas (ATLL) (Poiesz et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:7415, 1980; Kalyanaraman et al. Science 218:571, 1982). HTLV-1 infection in man can be associated with a "smoldering" pre-leukemic condition that can progress to an overt aggressive ATLL or can remain unchanged for years (Yamaguchi et al. Blood 62:758, 1983). The apparent long latency period prior to onset of ATLL presents a major epidemiological problem in containing the spread of infection by healthy, HTLV-I+ carriers and in identifying those exposed to the virus. HTLV-I can be transmitted by sexual intercourse, shared intravenous drug-abuse equipment, breast milk, and in utero or peripartum exposure (Wong-Staal and Gallo Nature 317:395, 1985). Currently, there is no way to eliminate HTLV-I from infected humans or to prevent viral transmission or development of disease.SUBSTITUTESHEET 

 In addition to ATLL, HTLV-I infection has also been associated with tropical spastic paraparesis (Gessain et al. Lancet 11:698, 1986), chronic progressive myelopathies (Osame et al. Ann. Neurol. 21:117, 1987), multiple sclerosis (Koprowski et al. Nature 318:154, 1985), non-Hodgkinâ€¢s lymphomas (Gibbs et al. Assoc. Intern, ed. 106:361, 1987) , and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Mann et al. Science 236;1103, 1987). HTLV-II has been associated with a rare form of chronic leukemia called T-cell variant of Hairy Cell Leukemia (Kalyanaraman et al. Science 218:471, 1982) .While HTLV-I has a worldwide distribution, localized endemic regions have been identified in southern Japan (Hiruma et al. Int. J. Cancer 29:631, 1983) , the Caribbean basin (Blattner et al. Lancet 11:61, 1983), southeastern United States (Blayney et al. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 250:1048. 1983), Africa (Biggar et al. Int. J. Cancer 34:215, 1984), and other regions. The epidemiology of HTLV-II is less well known, although the prevalence of HTLV-II seropositivity is increasing
