<ABSTRACT>
Tilting hinge for awnings or the like, in the case of which, as a means for preventing swinging-up, a retaining surface (51) is arranged on a retaining element (41) which is arranged in front of the stop element, which restricts the opening-out inclination, in a tension-resistant manner in the opening-out direction and such that it can move transversely with respect to the opening-out direction and is controlled by an opening-out arm (17) such that, in the retracted state of the awning, it releases the stop element (37) which restricts the opening-out inclination and, in the extended state of the awning, fully covers and locks said element.

<CLAIMS>
A tilting joint for awnings or the like, having a holder (15) which is tiltably mounted 
on a support (14), which holder bears a swivel joint (19) for a hook-out arm (17) and 

comprises a stop face (40) and a retaining face (51) for a stop element (37) which is 
fixed to the support (14) and which delimits the slope of drop-out of the awning (10), 

wherein the retaining face is disposed on a retaining element fashioned as a sliding part 
(41) which is disposed on the holder (15) so that it is resistant to tension in the 

direction of drop-out (53) and can move transversely to the direction of drop-out (53). 
and can be operated by the hook-out arm (17), 
characterised in that
 the sliding part 
(41) has a C-shaped cross-section and its end flanges (43, 44) engage round the top part 

of a T-shaped guide rail (45) constructed on the holder (15). 
A tilting joint according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the sliding part (41) which 
engages behind the holder (15) is mounted transversely displaceably in front of the 

latter and comprises the retaining face (51) on its inner face, with which retaining face 
it can cover or expose a recess (38) in the holder (15) for the stop element (37), which 

recess is provided with the stop face (40). 
A tilting joint according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the stop element (37) 
is axially adjustable on an elongated holding element (32), which is fixed to the support 

(14) and which passes, so that it is axially adjustable, through an opening (36) in the 
holder (15), and that the sliding part (41) has a slot (50) which extends in its direction 

of movement (41, 52) and which is open at the edge, the width (b) of which slot is 
somewhat greater than the diameter (d) of the elongated holding element (32). 
A tilting joint according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the 
elongated holding element (32) is a threaded rod, one end (31) of which is swivel-mounted 

on the support (14) and on to the other, free end (35) of which a threaded nut  
 

is screwed. as a stop element (37), which fits into the recess (38) in the holder (15) 
with ample clearance so that it can be turned from the outside with a socket spanner. 
A tilting joint according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the sliding 
part (41) can be operated by the hook-out arm (17), via a displacement device (54) 

which determines the length of travel (I) of the sliding part, and is moved into its 
effective position by a spring element (59). 
A tilting joint according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the 
displacement device (54) comprises a spring-loaded threaded plunger (55) which passes 

axially movably through the holder (15), is screwed into the sliding part (41) and is 
acted upon at its free top end (55b) by the hook-out arm (17).
