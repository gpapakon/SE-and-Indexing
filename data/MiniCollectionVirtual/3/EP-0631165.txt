<ABSTRACT>
A transmission line switching apparatus comprises an 
optical fiber connecting board (22) for holding a plurality of 

first optical fibers (12), an optical fiber arranging board (24), 
arranged apart from the connecting board with a 

predetermined spacing between them in the horizontal 
direction, for holding a plurality of second optical 

fibers (16), and a robot for handling the second fibers. Each 
second optical fiber extends to the connecting board (22) 

through the arranging board (24), and the distal end of the 
second optical fiber is detachably attached to the 

connecting board (22) so as to be selectively connected to one 
of the first optical fibers. When the distal end of the 

second optical fiber is attached to the connecting board (22), 
the second optical fiber is laterally extended in a 

loosened state between the two boards. In this state, the 
entangled states of the second optical fibers near the 

two boards are sparser than that in the intermediate 
position between the two boards. Therefore, the robot 

can easily handle the second optical fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission line
switching apparatus and a transmission line switching
method which can be applied to a switching apparatus of a
communication network using optical fibers.As shown in Fig. 1, a conventional optical fiber
switching apparatus includes an optical fiber connecting
board 5 for connecting a plurality of first optical
fibers 2 of a first optical fiber cable 1, such as an
office optical fiber cable, to a plurality of second
optical fibers 4 of a second optical fiber cable 3, such
as a subscriber optical fiber cable.A plurality of through holes are formed in a matrix
form in the optical fiber connecting board 5, and a
connector adapter 6 is fitted in each through hole. A
connector plug (not shown) is attached to the end portion
of each first optical fiber 2. This connector plug is
inserted from one side into the connector adapter 6 and
fixed in it. A connector plug 7 is also attached to the
end portion of each second optical fiber 4. This
connector plug 7 is detachably inserted from the other 
side into the connector adapter 6. Therefore, it is
possible to switch the connections between the first and
second optical fibers 2 and 4 by changing the connector
adapters 6 into which the connector plug 7 of the second
optical fiber 4 is to be inserted.When the second optical fibers 4 of the second
optical fiber cable 3 are inserted directly into the
connector adapters 6 of the optical fiber connecting
board 5, these second optical fibers 4 are entangled. To
reduce this entangled state, therefore, an optical fiber
arranging board 8 is disposed horizontally at a position
above and in front of the optical fiber connecting board
5. In this optical fiber arranging board 8, through holes
are formed in a matrix form so that the second optical
fibers 4 are passed through these holes. The second
optical fibers 4 are held in a two-dimensionally arranged
state after being passed through these through holes.
When the connector plugs 7 of the second optical fibers 4
are connected to the optical fiber connecting board 5,
the second optical fibers 4 suspended from the optical
fiber arranging board 8 are loosened, as illustrated.Generally, such a switching apparatus is manually
handled by a worker. That is, a worker selects one of the
second optical fibers 4, as an object to be switched,
holds the connector plug 7 of the selected fiber 4 between
his or her fingers, and removes the selected fiber 4 from 
the connector adapter 6 of the optical fiber connecting
board 5. Thereafter, the
