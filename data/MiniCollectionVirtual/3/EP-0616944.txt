<ABSTRACT>
A method for filling and closing containers is proposed, in which the containers are filled in a filling machine (1) and are guided to a closing machine (2) and closed in the latter and, on the transport path to the closing machine or in the latter, are subjected to loading with steam. The known methods are to be improved to the effect that, on the one hand, the ambient air located in the head space of the can or bottle is not absorbed at all or is safely expelled and, even before the closing operation, is replaced by an inert gas. For this purpose, it is proposed that the free space of the can remaining after filling be loaded by condensable steams and the condensation of these take place in an atmosphere formed by inert gas, immediately before the closing operation, and at the same time the free space be filled up as a result of the inflow of an inert gas.
