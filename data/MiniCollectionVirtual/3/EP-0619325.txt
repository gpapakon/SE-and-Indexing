<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for preparing polyolefins 
having a multimodal or at least bimodal molecular weight distribution 

by contacting in a reaction mixture under polymerization conditions at 
least one olefin and a catalyst system comprising a supported 

catalyst-component comprising an alumoxane and at least two 
metallocenes containing the same transition metal and selected from 

mono, di, and tri-cyclopentadienyls and substituted cyclopentadienyls 
of a transition metal and wherein at least one of the metallocenes is 

bridged and at least one of the metallocenes is unbridged.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing catalysts for producing polyolefins having a
bi- or multimodal molecular weight distribution.Polyolefins having a multimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD)
can be converted into articles by extrusion molding, thermoforming,
rotational molding, etc. and have advantages over typical polyolefins
lacking the multimodal MWD. Polyolefins having a multimodal MWD may
be processed more easily, i.e. they can be processed at a faster
throughput rate with lower energy requirements and at the same time
such polymers evidence reduced melt flow perturbations and are
preferred due to improved properties for applications such as high
strength films.There are several known methods for producing polyolefins having a
multimodal MWD; however, each method has its own disadvantages.
Polyolefins having a multimodal MWD can be made by employing two
distinct and separate catalysts in the same reactor each producing a
polyolefin having a different MWD; however, catalyst feed rate is
difficult to control and the polymer particles produced are not
uniform in size, thus, segregation of the polymer during storage and
transfer can produce non-homogeneous products. A polyolefin having a
bimodal MWD can also be made by sequential polymerization in two
separate reactors or by blending polymers of different MWD during
processing; however, both of these methods increase capital cost. European Patent NÂ° 0128045 discloses a method of producing
polyethylene having a broad molecular weight distribution and/or a
multimodal MWD. The polyethylenes are obtained directly from a single
polymerization process in the presence of a catalyst system comprising
two or more metallocenes each having different propagation and
termination rate constants, and aluminoxane.There are certain limits to the known methods for preparing bimodal
molecular weight distribution or multimodal molecular weight
distribution polyolefins. Even under ideal conditions the gel
permeation chromatograph curves don't show a marked bimodal MWD of the
polyolefin. The MWD and shear rate ratios of the polymer and the
catalyst activity disclosed in the known methods are rather poor.
Further the known metallocene catalyst systems for producing bimodal
MWD use aluminoxane as cocatalyst during the polymerization which
causes severe fouling inside the reactor and renders the use of such a
type of catalyst in continuous processes almost impossible.It is therefore not surprising that none of the known methods for
producing a multimodal MWD
