 CERUMEN FILTER FOR HEARING AIDSBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to preventing cerumen, or ear wax, from interfering with the operation of sound transmission devices, especially "in the ear" hearing aids, and is particularly concerned with a novel filter for achieving that result.The human outer ear comprises the visible exter¬ nal ear, or pinna, and a dynamic S-shaped canal that has a generally oval cross section and is about an inch (2.5 cm) long. Cerumen is secreted by the walls of the canal in the outer half inch (1.2 cm) or so and gradually moved outward; some believe that this outward movement is brought about by cilia in the walls, but more likely it is caused by the natural action of the ear canal. When a hearing aid is in¬ serted into the outer 1/4 inch (about 0.6 cm) of the canal, it becomes susceptible to cerumen, which mixes with sloughed off skin and often fouls the hearing aid's sound delivery tube, thereby reducing its efficiency. When the sound delivery tube of a hearing aid clogs with cerumen and reduces the effectiveness of sound transmission, the wearer of a hearing aid typically turns up the volume control. This in turn results in two unde¬ sirable conditions. Not only does the hearing aid battery wear out more quickly with certain types of circuit, but the likelihood of embarrassing and frequently painful feed¬ back howl also increases. Most importantly, cerumen in the sound tube of the hearing aid is the basis for large num¬ bers of costly hearing aid repairs. There have been numerous attempts to modify hearing aids to avoid the problems discussed in the preced¬ ing paragraphs. Thus, for example, U.S. Pats. No. 4,870,689 and 4,972,488 disclose a tubular passage having a series of baffles that define a "tortuous path" that the wax must travel before reaching the sound tube. U.S. Pat. No. 4,800,982 describes a hearing aid through which solvent may be pumped to remove wax buildup. U.S. Pat. No. 

 4,953,215 describes a hearing aid in which a domed membrane having a small central opening is provided, wax being said to accumulate in a ring around the base of the membrane.Still others have attempted to devise some type 5 of filter to prevent ear wax from reaching the sound deliv¬ ery tube. For example, U.S. Pats. No. 3,414,685 and 4,984,277 discuss various prior art wax filters, noting the apparent difficulty in replacing them after they are soiled. In each case, the patentees' approach to the prob- 0 lem is to provide a one-piece plastic part that has numer¬ ous

 What is claimed is as follows :
1 1. For use in connection with a sound transmit -
XI ting device of the type in which a housing containing a
3 sound transmitting tube having a sound outlet port con-
4- fronting the ear drum, said device fitting within a user ' s
5 ear canal,
:
6 a readily installed and replaced disposable wax guard
77 for mounting over the sound outlet port to prevent cerumen
8 from fouling said outlet port, comprising a thin, flexible
9 carrier membrane adapted to be temporarily adhered in posi-
10 tion over the portion of the sound transmitting device
11 nearest to the ear drum, the portion of said guard overly-
12 ing said outlet port being porous to sound and receptive
13 to cerumen.
1 2. For use in connection with an "in the ear"
2 hearing aid of the type in which a housing containing a mi-
3 crophone, an amplifier, and a speaker fit within the user's
4 ear canal, with a sound-transmitting tube extending from
5 adjacent the speaker to a sound outlet port at the portion
6 of the housing nearest to the ear drum,
7 a disposable wax guard for mounting over the sound
8 outlet port to prevent cerumen from fouling said outlet
9 port, comprising a thin, flexible carrier membrane 10 adapted to be temporarily adhered in position over said H outlet port, the portion of said guard overlying said out- 2 let port being porous to sound and oleophilic, so as to be I receptive to cerumen.
1 3. The wax guard of claim 2 wherein the membrane
2 is compressible, resilient open cell foam, one side of said
3 membrane being provided with a normally tacky and pressure- 4- sensitive adhesive layer except in that portion adapted to 5 overlie the sound outlet port of the hearing aid. 


 4. The wax guard of claim 3 wherein the normally tacky and pressure-sensitive adhesive layer-is in the form of a double-coated tape.
5. The wax guard of claim 2 wherein the sound- porous portion of the membrane is a hole having a slightly larger diameter than that of the outlet port and a mat of nonwoven fibers overlies said hole and is adhered to the circumjacent portions of said membrane.
6. The wax guard of claim 5 wherein the nonwoven mat is oleophilic.
7. The wax guard of claim 5 wherein the nonwoven mat consists essentially of blown microfibers.
8. The wax guard of claim 7 wherein the blown microfibers are polypropylene.
9. The wax guard of claim 6 wherein the membrane is provided with a normally tacky and pressure-sensitive adhesive so that it can be removably attached to the hear- ing aid housing.
10. The wax guard of claim 2 wherein the mem- brane is configured to have a plurality of lobes that can be removably adhered to the hearing aid housing.
11. The wax guard of claim 10 wherein there are only two lobes and they are adapted to adhere respectively to the anterior and posterior sides of the hearing aid. 


 12. The wax guard of claim 8 wherein the blown microfibers are polypropylene.
13. An "in the ear" hearing aid having a sound outlet port, the wax guard of claim 3 being mounted over said outlet port.
14. The wax guard of claim 3 wherein the mem- brane is configured to have a plurality of lobes that can be removably adhered to the hearing aid housing.
15. The wax guard of claim 14 wherein there are only two lobes, and they are adapted to adhere respectively to the anterior and posterior sides of the hearing aid.
16. The wax guard of claim 15 wherein the two lobes are of unequal size.
17. A release liner having removably adhered to the face thereof the wax guard of claim 16.
18. The product of claim 17 wherein one lobe of the wax guard is removably adhered to a folded release liner and the remainder of the wax guard is adhered to a conventional release liner.
19. The product of claim 18 wherein the larger lobe is adhered to the folded liner.
20. A kit comprising a plurality of the products of claim 18, the dimensions of the open cell foam membrane being different on the individual guards.
21. A method of providing better sealing between 


an "in the ear" hearing aid and the ear canal in which said hearing aid is mounted comprising temporarily adhering a resilient foam material to the surface of the hearing aid that confronts the anterior wall of the ear canal.
22. The method of claim 21 wherein the resilient foam material is characterized by retarded recovery.
