<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel ammonium salts of 
organo-oxyphosphorus acids, organo-thiophosphorus acids and 
their esters and to the use thereof as additives for 
lubricants, especially for providing protection against 
extreme pressure and corrosion, to compositions containing 
these novel salts, a method for lubricating metal surfaces in 
frictional contact, and a metal surface treated with the salt 
or lubricant composition. In EP 277,711 there is disclosed a method for protecting 
metal surfaces against corrosion by treating the metal surface 
with the reaction product of a polyester and an amine or salt 
thereof with an organic acid, chloride or sulphate. It is also known to improve the wear resistance of metal 
surfaces by incorporating ammonium salts of organophosphorus 
acid derivatives in lubricating oil compositions. Thus, it 
has been proposed in US 4,962,227 to use ammonium salts of 
methyl phosphonic acid as lubricant additives and in US 
4,514,311 to use specific ammonium salts of phosphate esters 
for a similar purpose. None of these compounds are wholly satisfactory under 
all operating conditions, particularly under extreme pressure. 
It has now been found that ammonium salts of 
organo-oxyphosphorus acids, organo-thiophosphorus acids and 
their esters with the polyesteramine disclosed in EP 277,711 
are especially effective as lubricant additives and provide a 
number of desirable properties, especially when incorporated 
in lubricating oils and greases. According to the present invention there is provided an 
ammonium salt of an organo-oxyphosphorus acid, an 
organo-thiophosphorus acid or esters thereof (hereinafter 
referred to as the "Polyester ammonium salt") with a 
polyesteramine of Formula I 
Y - CO - [O - A - CO]n - Z - R  
 
wherein 
A is a divalent hydrocarbon radical; Y is a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted hydrocarbon 
group; n is an integer from 1 to 100; Z is a divalent bridging group; and R is an amino group. The precise structure of the chain terminating group Y 
is not critical provided it is inert to the other components 
of the composition under the normal processing conditions to 
which it is subjected. It is preferably free from ionic and 
strongly polar groups and preferably has a molecular weight of 
less than 300 and contains only C and H or C, H and O atoms. The group Y is preferably alkyl or alkenyl containing up 
to 35 carbon atoms, especially from 7 to 25, and more 
especially from 7 to 20 carbon atoms such as heptyl, octyl, 
undecyl,
