<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to elastic suspension devices connecting two objects which are capable of moving one with respect to the other. The suspension device according to the invention is essentially characterised in that it includes at least one substantially C-shaped piece 10, this C-shaped piece advantageously including a substantially C-shaped central core 20 and a primary winding 21 of a strip 22 of composite material around and in contact with the central core 20, the primary winding being produced such that the plane of the strip is perpendicular to the plane of the C. Application, in particular, to the production of suspension devices for vehicles such as cars or the like.

An elastic suspension (9) for interconnecting two objects (3, 5) capable of
moving one relative to the other, the suspension being constituted by at least

one substantially C-shaped piece (10) whose two ends (11, 12) are
respectively mounted in association with said two objects (3, 5), said C-shaped

piece comprising a substantially C-shaped central core (20), the
suspension being characterized by the fact that it further comprises a primary

winding (21) of a strip (22) of composite material around and in contact with
said central core, said primary winding being performed in such a manner that

the normal to the strip at any given point thereof is contained in or remains
parallel to the plane defined by the central core so that said strip passes

around each of the two said ends.
A suspension according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that said C-shaped
piece (10) further comprises a secondary winding (30) situated

around said primary winding (21), said secondary winding being constituted
by turns (31) substantially centered on the longitudinal axis (100) of said

central core (20) and defined in planes that are substantially perpendicular to
the longitudinal axis of said central core.
A suspension according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that said
central core (20) and said secondary winding (30) are made of composite

material.
A suspension according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized by the
fact that it is constituted by a plurality of C-shaped pieces (10) associated with

each other in planes (41, 42, 43) that are parallel and do not coincide.
A suspension according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized by the
fact that it is constituted by a plurality of C-shaped pieces (10) associated with

one another in such a manner that all of said pieces lie in a common plane
(45).
A suspension according to claim 4 or 5, characterized by the fact that it
includes separator means between the C-shaped pieces (10). 
A suspension according to any one of claims 4 to 6, characterized by the

fact that it further comprises a tertiary winding (50) surrounding all of said
side-by-side C-shaped pieces with turns defined in planes that are

substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of said pieces.
A suspension according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized by the
fact that said strip (22) is in the form of a tape of composite material having

endless unidirectional fibers.
A suspension according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized by the
fact that it further comprises an intermediate layer of an elastic material

interposed between said central core (20) and said primary winding (21) of a
strip (22) of composite material.
A suspension according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized by the
fact that said central core (20) is made of a material constituting a heat sink.
A suspension according to any one of claims 1 to 10 when said primary
winding (21) of said strip (22) is made up of superposed layers and when it

includes a fixing pin (111, 112) at each of the ends of said central core (20),
the suspension being characterized by the fact that the first layers of the

primary winding (21) are wound in such a manner as to surround said fixing
pins (111, 112) almost completely and pass back over the convex face (62) of

the central core (20).
