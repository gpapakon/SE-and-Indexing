<ABSTRACT>
In a telecommunications network, such as the public switched telephone network, account must be taken of faults which can occur in the network. For instance, on occurrence of a local exchange failure, it is known to apply control such as route gapping and code blocking. The invention is concerned with detection of failure of a local exchange (116, 118) in a communications network. It relies on a combination of parameters, each parameter in the combination having to meet predetermined criteria. In particular, a local exchange failure is recognised when the average value of the All Circuits Engaged (ACE) parameters over all traffic routes into a local exchange rises in a significant manner and the average value of the Circuits in Service (CCTS IS) parameters over all traffic routes into that exchange decreases in a significant manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of controlling a 
communications network which includes at least one local 
exchange connected by routes to one or more parent trunk 
exchanges each being one of a plurality of trunk exchanges 
interconnected by trunk routes. It is particularly 
concerned with the detection of local exchange failures in 
such networks. Commonly a local exchange is associated with a home 
exchange, through which incoming calls to the local 
exchange are routed, and a security exchange, through which 
outward calls from the local exchange are routed, in normal 
operation. The security exchange is so called because it 
can also be used to route incoming calls to the local 
exchange if the home exchange fails. The security and home 
exchanges are collectively referred to as the parent 
exchanges of the local exchange. Exchanges other than the 
parent exchanges are referred to as far end trunk exchanges 
of the local exchanges. Near real-time network traffic management (NTM) is an 
essential component of network management if optimal 
traffic performance in terms of call throughput is to be 
ensured. To give an indication of the volume of traffic 
which may be involved, BT's trunk network in the United 
Kingdom currently handles approximately six million call 
attempts per hour during the busy periods which is 
equivalent to 1,700 call attempts per second. Given such 
a volume of traffic it is essential that any network 
difficulties are detected and controlled as quickly as 
possible. For example, difficulties are often encountered 
by network traffic managers due to abnormal traffic 
patterns which can be caused by events such as 'phone-ins, 
tele-votes and public holidays (for example Christmas Day 
and New Year's Eve/Day). In all these cases traffic in the 
network varies widely from the normal level, sometimes 
quite spectacularly, and the network must be controlled to 
maintain the best overall network performance.  
 A publication describing management of a 
telecommunications network is "Network Supervision and 
Management", by A Passeron, published in "Commutation & 
Transmission" Volume 13 No. Speciale 1991 pp 45-52.  
 With the introduction of digital switches such as System X it is possible to 
monitor closely the performance of each exchange and the routes between them and 
to the subscribers. BT's Network Traffic Management System (NTMS) currently 
receives statistics on upwards of 37,000 routes from 490 exchanges in the UK 
every five minutes, which measurement period was

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling a communications network, which includes at least 
one local exchange connected by one or more routes to one or more parent trunk 

exchanges, each parent trunk exchange being one of a plurality of trunk exchanges 
interconnected by trunk routes, characterised in that the method comprises applying 

controls to the network to deal with a local exchange failure when the average value 
of the All Circuits Engaged (ACE) parameters over all traffic routes into a local 

exchange is greater than a first threshold and there has been a decrease in the 
average value of the Circuits in Service (CCTS IS) parameters over all traffic routes 

into the local exchange greater than a second threshold over the duration of a 
measurement period. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the first threshold is at least 10%. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in which the second threshold 
is at least 20%. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in which the measurement 
period is approximately five minutes. 
A communications network including at least one local exchange which is 

connected by one or more routes to one or more parent trunk exchanges, each 
parent trunk exchange being one of a plurality of trunk exchanges interconnected by 

trunk routes, and control means for applying controls to the network, characterised 
in that there is included a system responsive to the average value of the All Circuits 

Engaged (ACE) parameters over all traffic routes into the local exchange being 
greater than a first threshold, and a decrease in the average value of the Circuits in 

Service (CCTS IS) parameters over all traffic routes into the local exchange greater 
than a second threshold, over the duration of a measurement period, to provide a 

signal indicating that the local exchange has failed. 
A communications network including at least one local exchange which is 
connected by one or more routes to one or more parent trunk exchanges, each  

 
parent trunk exchange being one of a plurality of trunk exchanges interconnected by 

trunk routes, and control means for applying controls to the network, characterised 
in that there is included a system to cause controls to be applied to the network by 

means of the control means, said system being responsive to the average value of 
the All Circuits Engaged (ACE) parameters over all traffic routes into the local 

exchange being greater than a first threshold and a decrease in the average value of 
the Circuits in Service (CCTS IS) parameters over all traffic routes into the local 

exchange greater than a second threshold over the duration of a measurement 
period.
