<ABSTRACT>
A surgical instrument (50) is provided which is insertable 
through an endoscopic tube to enable a surgeon to perform 

a surgical technique inside a body cavity. The surgical 
instrument includes a shaft with a pivotally mounted tip (60) 

attached thereto, the shaft extending from a handle (80) for 
gripping the instrument for insertion to the body cavity. 

The tip (60) of the shaft is adjustable to different angular 
orientations relative to the support shaft (70) and is rotatable 

at any angular orientation of the tip. The support shaft (70) 
may be rotatable about its longitudinal axis relative to 

the handle (80), or it may be fixed with respect to the handle, 

in which case the handle may be rotated to rotate the shaft 
inside the body cavity. The surgical 

instrument comprises an endoscopic stapling device and the 
tip of the instrument comprises a staple cartridge (100) which is 

rotatable 360Â° about its axes after the cartridge has been 
articulated with respect to the support shaft. An improved 

device for articulating the shaft tip (60) is also provided in 
which a control knob is mounted to the support shaft for 

providing sweeping articulation of the shaft tip. Separate 
actuator mechanisms (82,84) are provided on the handle to control 

the pivotal movement of the shaft tip, as well as the 
rotation of the shaft tip and the rotation of the support 

shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical instruments having 
an articulating end pivotally connected to a shaft, wherein 
the articulating end may be rotated about a longitudinal 
axis over a plurality of angles of articulation with 
respect to the longitudinal axis of the shaft. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to endoscopic 
instruments such as a surgical stapling instrument for 
applying surgical staples to internal body tissue and, more 
particularly, to a surgical stapler which can be used 
endoscopically for the repair of hernias. Most 
specifically, this invention relates to an endoscopic 
surgical stapling instrument including a staple cartridge 
which is pivotally and rotatably mounted to allow the 
surgical staples to be applied to the internal body tissue 
in any desired orientation. Additionally, the present 
invention relates to an improved mechanism for providing 
articulation to the articulating end of the instrument. With the proliferation of endoscopic surgery, it has 
been realized that there are many procedures typically 
performed in open surgery which can be performed 
endoscopically. In endoscopic surgery, a trocar, which is  
 
a pointed piercing device, is inserted into the body with 
a cannula placed around the trocar. After the trocar 
pierces the body cavity walls, it is removed and the 
cannula remains in the body. Through this cannula, 
endoscopic procedures can be conducted. Generally, the 
endoscopic procedures are performed under insufflation. 
Some of the more typical endoscopic procedures have 
included gall bladder removal, tissue repair, and 
sterilization procedures such as occluding of fallopian 
tubes. Surgeons realize that it may be possible to perform 
additional procedures endoscopically, once the proper 
materials and mechanisms become available for performing 
these procedures. One of the more basic, and quite logical 
extensions of current endoscopic procedures has been 
focused on the repair of hernias. It is realized that to 
have the capability of performing hernia repair 
endoscopically will benefit the medical community in many 
ways. Specifically, it is realized that endoscopic hernia 
repair will allow the patient to recuperate more rapidly, 
and without the more than likely extensive physical therapy 
currently practiced as a result of a hernia repair 
performed by open surgery. Moreover, it is realized that hernia repair procedures 
may contain aspects which are applicable in other 
procedures. For instance, if it is possible to cover, or
