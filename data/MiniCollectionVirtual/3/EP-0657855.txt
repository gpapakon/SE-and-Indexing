<ABSTRACT>
To identify coins, these are individualised by an individualisation equipment designed as a rotatable perforated disc (12). An identification measurement is subsequently carried out as long as the coins are still located in the holes (28) of the perforated disc (12). To carry out the measurement, a light barrier (26), for example, or an inductive or capacitive scanning equipment can be used. By means of a positioning equipment, which acts in an accelerative or decelerative manner on the coins which are located in the holes (28), the coins are held in a specific, exactly defined position during the measurement.
