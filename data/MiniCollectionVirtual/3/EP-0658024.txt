<ABSTRACT>
This local network with radio transmission includes several stations (S1, ..., S4) each consisting of a computer machine (M) coupled to a radio transmission/reception (IRP, IRE) interface (IR). Each computer machine includes a coupler (CE) for sending a message containing an address designating an addressee station, and for receiving messages which are addressed to it. The network further includes a repeater (R) including a radio transmission/reception interface (IRE', IRR'), coupled to a radiating cable (CR) passing in proximity to all the stations, in order to: receive all the messages sent by the stations, amend these messages, this amendment indicating that the message has passed through the repeater; then resending these messages on the radiating cable. The radio transmission-reception interface (IRR, IRE) of each station includes means (37) for taking account only of the messages which have been sent by the repeater (R). Application to local networks of computer machines.

Wireless local area network including a plurality of
stations (S1, ..., S4) each including means (IRR, IRE) for

sending and receiving radio messages and a repeater (R) for
retransmitting each message sent by a station, said repeater

being connected to a radiating cable (CR) passing near all the
stations, each station including means (37) for processing

only messages addressed to it and retransmitted by the
repeater;

   characterised in that the repeater receives and
retransmits the messages from the stations in the same

frequency band, half-duplex, but add to each message
retransmitted at least one item of information indicating that

the message has passed through the repeater;

   and in that each station includes means (37) for
ignoring messages that do not contain information indicating

that the message has passed through the repeater.
Network according to claim 1 characterised in that
each station includes means (2) for sending each message with

a predetermined duration (D);

in that the repeater (R) includes means (PR) for
retransmitting each message after a predetermined time delay

at least equal to the fixed message duration (D);
and in that each station includes means (CE) for
comparing a message received from said repeater after sending

a message with the message that it sent and sending said
message again with a pseudo-random time-delay if the

comparison does not indicate that said messages are identical.
Network according to claim 1 characterised in that
the repeater includes means for adding to each retransmitted

message binary information to control at least one station;
and in that each station includes means (37) for

receiving binary control information added to a message
retransmitted by the repeater.
Network according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the repeater (R) includes means for sending service messages

to stations at its own initiative and in that each station
includes means (37) for executing an instruction contained in

a service message addressed to it.
Network according to claim 4 characterised in that
each station includes means for sending at a variable power

level controlled by service messages sent to it by the
repeater;

   and in that the repeater includes means (P) for
determining said power in such a way as to achieve a given

quality of transmission between the repeater and said station.
Network according to claim 1 characterised in that
the repeater (R') further includes means (C) for connecting it

to at least one cable local area network (B, S6 to S10); said
means retransmitting at least some of the radio messages sent

by the stations (S1 to S5) on the cable local area network, in
the format corresponding thereto;

   and retransmitting messages from the cable network on
the radiating cable (CR).
Network according to claim 3 characterised in that:

the repeater includes means (PR) for adding to each
message a binary word specific to said network;

   all the stations include means (37) for detecting said
binary word in each message received and ignoring messages

which do not include the binary word specific to the network
of which they are part.
Network according to claim 7 characterised in that
the repeater and all the stations include means (6 to 14) for

sending in all of said bandwidth using a spectrum spreading
method.
Network according to claim 8 characterised in that
the repeater and the stations include, for sending:


a source (6) delivering bursts of high-frequency
signal having a predetermined duration and a Gaussian form of

amplitude modulation; 
a Barker sequence generator (8) processing the bursts
delivered by the source;
means (1 to 4) for coding messages to be transmitted
in the form of a binary signal having a fixed bit period and a

fixed number of bits, said binary signal controlling the
source (6);

   and including, for receiving:

a correlator (28) whose weighting coefficients are
binary values ± 1 constituting a Barker sequence complementary

with that used for sending; and
means (29 to 37) for decoding messages received using
a signal supplied by the correlator (28).
Network according to claim 9 characterised in that
the Barker sequence generator (8) for sending and the

correlator (28) for receiving each comprise a surface acoustic
wave device including electrodes whose geometrical

characteristics correspond to the binary values of said Barker
sequence.
Network according to claim 1 characterised in that
each station includes means (4) for calculating and inserting

into each message that it sends at least one error detecting
bit;

   and includes means (34) for calculating an error

detecting bit from each message that it receives, comparing it
to that contained in said message, and if necessary sending a

message requesting repeating of the last message sent to it,
if the comparison indicates that this latter message includes

an error.
Station for a wireless local area network according
to any one of claims 1 to 11, the network including a repeater

for retransmitting each message sent by a station of the
network, this repeater being coupled to a radiating cable

passing near all the stations of the network, the station
including means (37) for sending and receiving radio messages

and for processing only messages addressed to it that have 
been retransmitted by the repeater, characterised in that said

means of the station are adapted to ignore messages that do
not contain information indicating that the message has passed

through the repeater.
Repeater for a wireless local area network
including a plurality of stations according to any one of

claims 1 to 11, the repeater being coupled to a radiating
cable passing near all the stations of the network,

characterised in that the repeater receives and retransmits
the messages from the stations in the same frequency band,

half-duplex, but adds to each message at least one item of
information indicating that the message has passed through the

repeater.
