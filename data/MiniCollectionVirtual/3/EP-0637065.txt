<ABSTRACT>
A new method for planarization of shallow trenches 
is presented. Shallow trenches (11-14) are patterned into a 

semiconductor substrate (5) that has been coated with a 
layer of silicon nitride (7). A conformal coating of oxide (10) 

is deposited onto the wafer to fill the trenches. A 
thin layer (15) of etch-stop silicon and a second layer (20) of 

oxide are then deposited. The second layer (20) of oxide is 
patterned with a filler mask (26) using conventional 

photolithographic techniques and etched to the silicon 
etch-stop layer, leaving blocks of oxide in the 

depressions above the trenches and oxide spacers along 
the sidewalls. Chemical mechanical polishing is then 

used to polish the oxide back to the silicon nitride. 
The process offers excellent global planarity, minimal 

variation in silicon nitride thickness across active 
areas of varying size and density, and relative 

insensitivity to chip design.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of fabricating
semiconductor devices and more specifically to a
planarization process for use during the fabrication of
semiconductor devices.Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) and Ultra Large
Scale Integration (ULSI) circuits utilize a variety of
devices having different feature sizes or device
dimensions. Such devices include, but are not limited
to, transistors, diodes, capacitors, resistors and
wires. The minimum state of the art device dimensions
have shrunk to the submicron level. Some devices may
have submicron feature sizes while others may
simultaneously have much greater feature sizes. Shallow
trenches of constant height and varying widths are used
to isolate individual devices. These trench widths can
vary greatly. These trenches are typically filled with
a dielectric material, such as silicon oxide. Because
of the complex topography, especially when shallow 
trenches of greatly varying widths are used, a problem
often encountered is how to achieve a uniform oxide
fill, in those trenches, independent of trench size and
device density. For such VLSI and ULSI circuits,
topology management during fabrication has become a
critical process step.As feature sizes or device dimensions are scaled
downward, more stringent requirements on deposition,
photo, and etching processing are posed. Surface-clearing
planarization processes, such as are used to
create oxide-filled trench isolation, often require that
the planarized material thickness be controlled to
within a very tight tolerance. When simultaneously
achieved over all topographies this condition is
referred to as "global" planarization.As compared to conventional Local Oxidation of
Silicon (LOCOS) isolation, shallow trench isolation
(STI) offers improved isolation between devices and
greater packing density. Additionally STI offers a
higher degree of planarity, which becomes increasingly
important as the photolithographic depth of focus budget
continues to shrink with decreasing minimum line width.A common method for planarizing shallow trenches is
a combined resist etch-back (REB)/chemical mechanical
polish (CMP). This combined REB/CMP process sequence is 
as follows. The isolation trenches are patterned onto a
semiconductor wafer or substrate, generally a silicon
substrate. Oxide is deposited conformally onto the
wafer with patterned trenches. Photoresist filler
blocks then are patterned into the gaps above the
trenches. A second resist layer then is coated onto the
wafer to create a relatively planar surface.

A method of fabricating an integrated circuit

(a) forming trenches (11,12,13,14) on a face of a
semi-conductor substrate (5), the regions between the

trenches at the face defining active region mesas
