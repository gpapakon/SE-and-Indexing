<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blind apparatus which is
suspended on a wall or the like of a room and which can be
hoisted up or down arbitrarily. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a horizontal type blind in which a
plurality of slats are supported horizontally by means of a
ladder cord hung from a head box at a distance between
respective upper and lower slats and in which lifting cords fit
to a bottom rail disposed at the bottommost of the slats are
introduced upward through the slats and then introduced into the
head box, the lifting cords being further introduced within the
head box horizontally toward one end of the head box, and in
which the slats are lifted up or down by pulling or loosening
the lifting cords and turned by moving up or down vertical cords
located before and after the aforementioned ladder cord.Horizontal type blind apparatuses of the aforementioned
type have been widely used. The horizontal type blinds enable
the user to lift up or down the slats and adjust the slat angle
easily. It is also possible to suspend the slats at a desired
height by fastening the lifting cords at a desired position by
means of a stopper device.Recently, a new type blind apparatus has been proposed. 
According to the proposed invention, a rotating operation
rod for rotating the slats is disposed near one end of
the head box, and one end of the lifting cord is passed
through the rotating operation rod and introduced
downward from the bottom thereof. The slats are rotated
by means of the rotating operation rod and lifted up or
down by means of the lifting cords.An example of the invention has been disclosed in
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 61-102797.In the horizontal type blind apparatus of this type,
a stopper device which holds the motion of the lifting
cords is incorporated near one end of the head box in
order to fasten the lifting cords at a desired position.In the prior art, the following stopper devices for
the blind apparatus have been proposed. According to
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 58-27399, lifting cords
which are capable of lifting up or down the slats are
inserted through a hollow operation rod which is capable
of changing the inclination angle of the slats, and a
grip disposed at the lower end of the operation rod is
provided with a locking metal piece which is capable of
locking the lifting up or down of the lifting cords.US-A-3,633,646 and GB-A-2172039 describe blind
apparatus wherein a cord clamp for holding the lifting
cords in a selected position is
