<ABSTRACT>
A burner device utilizing combustible wastes as fuel comprising a 
body (1) having a main combusiton chamber (10), a preheating burner (2) 

mounted to the upper porion of the body and a subsidiary combustion 
chamber (4) mounted to the upper portion of the body at the front of the 

preheating burner. The subsidiary combustion chamber includes an 
inwardly tapered frustoconical tube (40) and an outwardly tapered air 

chamber (44) surrounding the frustoconicaltube and communicating with 
the tapered air chamber. The frustoconical tube of a 

diffusion-depression type includes a fire outlet (42) exposed to outside 
of the body, a inwardly tapered fire inlet (43) faced to the preheating 

burner, a plurality of heat resistant and antioxide metal strips (45) 
extending from the fire inlet to the fire outlet, an air discharging 

tube (46) disposed along the center line of the frustoconical tube 
at rear of the frustoconical tube and provided 

at its peripheral portion with a 
plurality of air ports (46h), a connecting tube (47) connected to the 

air discharging tube to extend vertically across the air discharging 
tube and communicate with the tapered air chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a burner device 
utilising combustible wastes such as waste tires, waste rubber 
articles, waste oil and so forth as fuel and more particularly, to 
a burner device which enables to remove air polluting imperfect 
combustion materials generated in the course of combustion through 
a subsidiary combustion chamber, and to widely utilise high 
temperature thermal energy in the state of flame for a burner 
device such as an industrial oil burner, generated by re-burning 
the imperfect combustion materials. It is generally known that a burner uses various types of oil 
such as light oil, bunker C oil and so forth as fuel, and a waste 
disposal device has existed only for burning and incinerating such 
combustible wastes as waste tires, waste rubber articles, waste 
oil and etc. US-A-4 123 979 discloses a multiple-chamber incinerator with a 
primary combustion chamber and a secondary combustion chamber or 
after burner. This after burner is disposed immediately above the 
primary combustion chamber and has a common wall with it. A blower 
is mounted to an exterior surface of a rear wall of the primary 
combustion chamber. A first blower discharge conduit is coupled at 
one end to the blower and has at one end each of four air 
discharge conduits coupled thereto. These conduits extend in 
spaced parallel relationship through rear wall into the interior 
of the primary combustion chamber terminating at points adjacent 
to a front wall of this chamber. The conduits are provided with 
ports for directing the air flow within the primary combustion 
chamber.  
 The afterburner includes an elongated exterior wall, generally 
in the inverted U-shaped form, which lies in the same vertical 
plane but spaced above the longitudinal centre line of the arcuate 
surface of a truncated oblique circular conoidal tube disposed 
within an elongated second burning chamber. Thereby, heat in the 
second chamber is reflected by the inner surface of said wall 
through the gases being consumed in the afterburner to the outer 
surface of the tube in narrowing pie-shaped arc segments and the 
tube is similarly reflecting it's heat from the inner surface of 
the tube to the centre line axis. In view of the foregoing prior art it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a controlling of the air supply to 
the secondary combustion chamber such that a complete combustion 
is obtained. In accordance with the present invention, this object can be 
accomplished by providing a burner device

<CLAIMS>
A burner device utilising combustible wastes as fuel 
comprising 


a body having an inner wall (11) defining a main 
combustion chamber (10), an outer wall (12) spaced from 

said inner wall, and an air passage (13) defined between 
said inner wall and said outer wall and adapted for 

receiving air from a fan (3), said inner wall having a 
plurality of air ports (14) for communicating the air 

passage (13) with said main combustion chamber (10); 
a preheating burner (2) mounted at the upper portion of 
said body to extend into said main combustion chamber 

(10); 
a fuel charging inlet (15) provided at the lower portion 
of said body and adapted for charging combustible wastes 

into said main combustion chamber; 
a support grill (16) mounted on the lower portion of 
said inner wall (11) and adapted for supporting 

combustible wastes thereon; and 
a subsidiary combustion chamber (4) mounted in the upper 
portion of said body and opposite said preheating burner 

(2), said subsidiary combustion chamber tapering towards 
the main combustion chamber interior and containing a 

frustoconical tube (40) also tapering towards the 
combustion chamber interior, whereby the taper of the 

subsidiary combustion chamber is less than the taper of 
the frustoconical tube (40), a tapered air chamber (44)  

 
being formed between said frustoconical tube (40) and 

the internal wall of the subsidiary combustion chamber, 
said air chamber (44) communicating with said air 

passage (13) via a branch tube (41), said frustoconical 
tube (40) communicating with said air chamber (44) via a 

passage, said frustoconical tube (40) consisting of a 
plurality of peripherally spaced, heat resistant 

antioxide metal strips (45) having a longitudinal gap 
(45t) between adjacent strips, said frustoconical tube 

(40) being of a diffusion depression-type having a flame 
outlet (42) exposed to the outside of said body, a flame 

inlet (43) tapering towards and connecting with said 
frustoconical tube (40), said inlet (43) facing said 

preheating burner (2), said metal strips (45) extending 
from the flame inlet (43) to the flame outlet (42) of 

the frustoconical tube (40), an air discharging tube 
(46) disposed along the centre line of said 

frustoconical tube at the exit (42) of said 
frustoconical tube and provided at it's periphery with a 

plurality of air ports (46h), and a connecting tube (47) 
connected to said air discharging tube (46) to extend 

vertically across said air discharging tube and 
communicate with said tapered air chamber (44).
