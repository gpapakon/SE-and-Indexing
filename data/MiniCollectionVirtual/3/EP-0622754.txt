<ABSTRACT>
A switching circuit (8) selects a display control 
circuit (4) in an image display period, and selects a 

detection control circuit (5) in an x-coordinate detection 
period. A row electrode drive circuit (2) outputs row 

electrode scanning pulses in the image display period to 
sequentially scan row electrodes (G). A column electrode 

drive circuit (3) outputs column electrode scanning pulses 
in the x-coordinate detection period to sequentially scan 

column electrodes (S). A coordinate detection circuit (7)

type tablet device concurrently having an image
display function for use in a laptop computer, a word
processor, or the like, and a method for driving the same.Conventionally, there has been a display-integrated
type tablet device formed by integratingly
laminating an image display unit with a tablet. Fig. 16
shows a schematic view of an electrostatic induction tablet
and a drive section thereof for use in such a display-integrated
type tablet device. Such a device is disclosed in EP-A-0 504 728.An electrostatic induction tablet 21 is formed by
placing a glass substrate on which column electrodes X1,
X2, ..., Xm (an arbitrary column electrode referred to as X
hereinafter) are arranged in parallel opposite to a glass
substrate on which row electrodes Y1, Y2, ..., Yn (an
arbitrary row electrode referred to as Y hereinafter) are
arranged in parallel so that the electrodes cross each 
other at right angles and fixing the substrates with
interposition of a spacer (transparent adhesive or the
like). Each row electrode Y is connected to a row
electrode shift register 22, while each column electrode X
is connected to a column electrode shift register 23.In the above case, the column electrode X and the
row electrode Y are formed of indium tin oxide (ITO) or the
like to be approximately transparent.The row electrode shift register 22 and the
column electrode shift register 23 are connected to a
timing generation circuit 24. The timing generation
circuit 24 is connected to an x-coordinate detection
circuit 27 and a y-coordinate detection circuit 28. The x-coordinate
detection circuit 27 detects the x-coordinate at
the tip end of an electronic pen 25 based on a signal from
the timing generation circuit 24 and a signal input from
the electronic pen 25 via an operational amplifier 26, and
outputs an x-coordinate signal representing the x-coordinate.
In the same manner as above, the y-coordinate
detection circuit 28 outputs a y-coordinate signal
representing the y-coordinate at the tip end of the
electronic pen 25.The electrostatic induction tablet 21 having the
above-mentioned construction has a light transmittance of
approximately 85%. Therefore, when the electrostatic 
induction tablet 21 is laminated on a liquid crystal
display, an image displayed on the liquid crystal display
can be viewed through the electrostatic induction tablet
21. Therefore, the electrostatic induction tablet 21 is
laminated on the liquid crystal display to construct a
