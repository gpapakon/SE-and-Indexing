<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerant. 
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, azeotropic 
compositions thereof and like compositions are known as 
working fluids or refrigerants. Among them, R-11 
(trichlorofluoromethane), R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), R-22 
(chlorodifluoromethane), etc. have been conventionally 
used as working fluids for refrigerators. In recent years, 
however, it has been suggested that some hydrogen-free 
chlorofluorocarbons, when released into the atmosphere, 
would deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, thereby 
inflicting a serious adverse influence on the ecosystem 
including humans on the earth. In view of the problem, a 
worldwide agreement calls for the restriction of use and 
production of major ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. 
Among the chlorofluorocarbons to be controlled for the 
restriction are R-11, R-12 and the like all of which are 
widely used as mentioned above. With the spread of refrigerators 
and air-conditioning systems, the use and production 
of these refrigerants are enjoying an annually increasing 
demand. However, the control over these refrigerants will 
greatly affect our residential environments and the current 
social framework as a whole. Consequently, there is an  
 
urgent demand for development of a novel refrigerant which 
has no or little potential to cause the problem of depleting 
the stratospheric ozone layer. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel refrigerant which has excellent properties for use in 
refrigerators, and which would exert little or no influence 
on the stratospheric ozone layer, when released into the 
atmosphere. During the research, we found that when using 
a mixture of three compounds selected from the group 
consisting of specific hydrofluorocarbons (hereinafter 
simply referred to as "HFC"), the contemplated object can be 
achieved. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a refrigerant comprising a mixture of three compounds 
selected from the group consisting of hydrofluorocarbons 
represented by the formula
