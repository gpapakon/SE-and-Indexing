<ABSTRACT>
A holding device for an integrated circuit chip (60) includes a thermally conductive body (10) provided with a cavity (12) in which are arranged thermoelectric modules (14, 15) having located thereon a conductive pad (16) on which is mounted a further thermoelectric module (18) in contact with a thermally conductive block (20). The block (20) extends into a gas chamber (50) located in the body (10) and having upper and lower thermally insulative, slotted plates (24, 27). A socket (22) mounted on the lower plate (22) receives, via the slot in the upper plate (27), an integrated circuit chip (60). The thermoelectric modules (14, 15, 18) serve to rapidly heat and cool the chip. Dry nitrogen gas supplied via an inlet (30) to the gas chamber (50) is directed towards the chip (60) by inclined edges of the slot in the upper plate (27), thereby inhibiting condensation during cooling of the chip (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
 HOLDING DEVICE FOR AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIPTechnical Field ,This invention relates to holding devices for integrated circuit chips, of the kind including socket means for releasably mounting a chip.Background ArtTwo operations frequently undertaken in con¬ nection with the manufacture of integrated circuit chips are failure analysis and temperature characterization. Failure analysis, which is a post-mortem examination of failed I.C. chips to determine the causes of failure, is an important procedure in semiconductor manufacturing. By' sing failure analysis, corrective actions may be taken in production processing, device design, test or application to eliminate the cause or prevent recurrence of the failure reported. Failure analysis typically consists of inserting a decapped I.C. chip into a test socket, subjecting the chip to extreme temperatures (in the range of about -60°C. to +150βC.) and performing electrical tests to determine (1) whether opens, shorts or abnormal characteristics exist between pairs of pins, pins and die or substrate, or pins and device package (2) the threshold voltages of transis¬ tors, clock signals, and (3), in general, the operating characteristics of the I.C. chip. Testing is accom¬ plished, typically, at an analytical probing test sta¬ tion with the aid of in-circuit probing equipment such as a micromanipulator which allows visual inspection of the individual circuits on a chip under high magnifi- cation (of up to 2000X) and probing of the circuits by means of tungsten probe tips.Closely related to failure analysis is tem¬ perature characterization of the I.C. chip. This is an electrical verification procedure by which a newly de- signed chip, immediately after fabrication, is subjected_0..-H 

to extremes of temperature to ensure that the chip meets all the required electrical parameters.In an article by D. A. Zeskind, "Thermoelec¬ tric Heat Pumps Cool Packages Electronically" , Elec- tronics, July 31, 1980, pages 104-113, the concept of utilizing thermoelectric modules in connection with hot and cold wafer-holding chucks for semiconductor testing is mentioned. Such thermoelectric modules utilize the Peltier effect and consist of a number of Peltier couples, formed by joining p-doped and n-doped semi¬ conductor elements, connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel by means of copper connecting strips. The couples are embedded between ceramic face¬ plates to electrically insulate the connecting strips from external surfaces. Passage of an electrical cur¬
