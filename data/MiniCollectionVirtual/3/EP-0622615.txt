<ABSTRACT>
In a method for determining the volume of a bellows reservoir 
(2) for medicine of an infusion system implantable in a patient 

the pressure in the reservoir is measured and the corresponding 
volume is determined from a predetermined relationship between 

pressure and volume. A corresponding apparatus comprises a 
pressure gauge (18) disposed to measure the pressure in the 

bellows reservoir and an unit (20, 28) disposed to determine a 
corresponding volume from the measured pressure value by means 

of the predetermined relationship between pressure and volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a apparatus for 
determining the volume of a bellows reservoir for medicines in 
an implantable infusion system. There is a need for continuous determination of the volume of 
such a reservoir, on one hand, in order to secure that the rest 
volume will not be too small before medicine is refilled, as the 
air which always is present in the reservoir then will be pumped 
out into the patient, and, on the other, because the pressure in 
the bellows reservoir decreases as the rest volume becomes less 
than 2 - 3 ml, which in its turn brings the pump to operate with 
larger pressure difference which gives reduced volume per pump 
stroke and cavitation in the pump which is detrimental to 
medicines like insulin. Further, it is desirable to be able to 
determine the volume of the bellows reservoir to avoid that the 
reservoir is filled too much during the filling operation. In 
the reservoir a depression shall prevail and during the filling 
medicine is sucked in by this depression. If, however, the 
reservoir is filled "too much" the prescribed depression will be 
lost. The purpose of the present invention is to propose a method and 
provide an apparatus for continuous determination of the volume 
of the bellows reservoir during the operation of the infusion 
system as well as during emptying and filling of its medicine 
reservoir. This purpose is obtained with a method according to claim 1 and 
an apparatus according to claim 3.  
 According to an advantageous further development of the method 
according to the invention said predetermined relationship 
between pressure and volume is determined by simultaneous 
measurement of the pressure and volume progresses during filling 
and emptying of the reservoir. With the aid of this relationship 
volumes corresponding to measured pressure values are 
determined. The pressure gauge can preferably be disposed in the filler port 
to the reservoir and be formed of a piezo-electric gauge. The unit for determining the volume from the measured pressure 
with the aid of the relationship between the quantities pressure 
and volume for the reservoir in question, which relationship is 
stored in the unit, is preferably arranged in an external equipment, 
placed outside the patient, output signals delivered by 
said pressure gauge being transmitted to this unit in telemetric 
way. The invention will now be described more in detail with 
reference to the enclosed drawings on which figure 1 shows 
typical pressure-volume-curves
