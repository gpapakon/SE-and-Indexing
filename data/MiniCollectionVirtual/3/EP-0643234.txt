<ABSTRACT>
A bearing arrangement is provided for supporting a movable member 
(10) for directing a fluid flow from a first direction. A bearing sleeve (8) . 

encloses a bearing (12, 13) and a shield (14) shields the bearing (12, 13) 
from the fluid flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bearing arrangement. Such an 
arrangement is suitable for supporting pivoted flow directors, such as 
vanes or aerofoils, within a fluid moving with respect to the flow 
director. Known supports for movable flow directors, such as a vane in a flow of 
gas, hold an extension of the vane between bearings located within a 
recess formed in a supporting wall at one end of the vane. Gas can flow 
along the side wall so seals are provided so as to prevent the gas from 
leaking into the bearings. The seals may be a combination of a face seal, 
an "O" ring seal and a labyrinth seal. The provision of the seals takes up 
space that could be used to provide further bearings so as to provide a 
stronger support. According to the present invention there is provided a bearing 
arrangement for a movable member for directing a fluid flow from a first 
direction, comprising a bearing sleeve enclosing a bearing, the bearing 
sleeve being attached to and movable with the movable member, and a 
shield for shielding the bearing from the fluid flow. It is thus possible to site the bearing in a region shielded from the fluid 
flow by the shield. Such shielding significantly reduces the fluid pressure 
acting around the bearing sleeve, thereby reducing seepage of the fluid 
into the bearings.  Preferably the movable member is supported by a cantilever connected 
to the bearing sleeve. Preferably the bearing sleeve is a cylindrical member supported on and 
co-axial with a support pin. Preferably ball or roller bearings are 
provided intermediate the bearing sleeve and the support pin so as to 
facilitate rotational movement between the sleeve and the support. As the region in which the bearing sleeve is situated may be at a higher 
temperature than that of the support pin, warming of the bearing 
arrangement results in a self-freeing effect such that the bearing 
arrangement is resistant to seizing at elevated temperatures. The provision of a shield directs the flow of fluid away from the bearing 
arrangement. Additionally it is believed that the resultant fluid flow 
around the shield creates a low pressure region down-stream of the 
bearing sleeve which tends to remove fluid from the region of the 
bearing. The fluid may, for example, be an exhaust gas which is 
particularly erosive. Thus the need for seals is removed and the space freed by the removal of 
the seals may be used to provide a longer bearing surface, thereby giving 
rise to a firmer and stronger support and significant increase

<CLAIMS>
A bearing arrangement for a movable member (10) for directing 
fluid flow from a first direction, characterised by a bearing sleeve (8) 

enclosing a bearing (12, 13), the bearing sleeve (8) being attached to and 
movable with the movable with the movable member (10), and a shield 

(14) for shielding the bearing (12, 13) from the fluid flow. 
A bearing arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the bearing sleeve (8) is a cylindrical member supported on and 

coaxial with a support pin (2). 
A bearing arrangement as claimed in Claim 2, characterised by 
ball or roller bearings (12) provided intermediate the bearing sleeve (8) 

and the support pin (2). 
A bearing arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the shield (14) alters the fluid flow such that, 

in use, a low pressure region is formed downstream of the bearing sleeve 
(8) which tends to remove fluid from the bearing. 
A bearing arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the bearing sleeve (8) carries a peripheral 

groove (17) for engaging with a drive belt to move the movable member 
(10). 
A bearing arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the movable member (10) is supported by a 

cantilever (30) connected to the bearing sleeve (8). 
A bearing arrangement as claimed in Claim 2 or any one of 
Claims 3 to 6 when dependent on Claim 2, characterised in that 

warming of the bearing sleeve (8) with respect to the support pin (2) 
increases the size of a gap between the bearing sleeve and the support 

pin (2), the gap containing the bearings.
