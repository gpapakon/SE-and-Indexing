of the liquid crystal alignment film in another 
direction and (5) removing the radiation-sensitive 

resin composition; and a liquid crystal device having a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
domain-dividing a liquid crystal alignment film and a
liquid crystal device using a domain-divided liquid
crystal alignment film. More specifically, it relates
to a method for domain-dividing a liquid crystal
alignment film, which gives liquid crystal cells
excellent in electric properties and liquid crystal
alignment properties, and a liquid crystal device using
a domain-divided liquid crystal alignment film.There are known liquid crystal display
devices (TN and STN display devices) having TN and STN
liquid crystal cells in which a nematic liquid crystal
having positive dielectric anisotropy is sandwiched
with transparent electrode-attached substrates having
liquid crystal alignment films formed of polyimide and
major axes of liquid crystal molecules can be
continuously twisted from 90 to 270Â° between the
substrates. However, these TN and STN display devices
have a problem in that the viewing angle of display is
narrow particularly for the display of a gray scale
tone, since the display is switched on and off using
the rise and decay of liquid crystal molecules having
the anisotropy of refractive index. For overcoming
this problem, it has been reported that the viewing
angle of display can be broadened by applying a
radiation-sensitive resin composition onto a liquid
crystal alignment film to partially protect the liquid
crystal alignment film so that the alignment is divided
(SID '92 Digest, p. 792, Japan Display '92 Digest, p.
591). In general, however, the above radiation-sensitive
resin composition is selected from those used
for semiconductors, and an aqueous solution containing 
2.38 % by weight of tetramethylammonium hydroxide
(TMAH) which is an alkaline compound is used as a
developer solution. There is therefore a problem in
that the so-obtained liquid crystal display device has
a problem in that it is poor in electric properties and
the liquid crystal is poor in alignment properties.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a method for domain-dividing a liquid crystal
alignment film, which overcomes the above problems and
which is free from deteriorating the electric
properties of a liquid crystal display device and the
alignment properties of a liquid crystal.It is another object of the present invention
to provide a liquid crystal device provided with a
liquid crystal display device having a liquid crystal
alignment film of which the alignment has been divided
by the above domain-dividing method.Other objects and advantages of the
