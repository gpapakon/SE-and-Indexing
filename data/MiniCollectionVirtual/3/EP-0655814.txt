<ABSTRACT>
A surge arrester for use in connection with a 
high voltage electric power distribution system includes 

a housing, a plurality of metal oxide varistor 
blocks disposed within the housing, a ground lead 

disconnector, and a conductive stud which electrically 
couples the ground lead disconnector to the varistor 

blocks. The surge arrester has a metal support arm 
disposed between the housing and the ground lead disconnector, 

and isolating members for electrically 
isolating the metal support arm from the conductive 

stud. The isolating members comprise a first insulative 
member disposed between the metal support arm and 

the housing, and a second insulative member disposed 
between the metal support arm and the ground lead 

disconnector. In the case of arrester failure, the 
isolating members prevent high voltage from being 

provided to the metal support arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insulative 
support bracket for mounting a high voltage surge 
arrester and, more particularly, to an insulative 
support bracket for preventing short circuits between 
the surge arrester and the structure to which the surge 
arrester is mounted. High voltage electric power distribution 
systems carry electric power having a voltage in the 
range, for example, of approximately 3,000 volts to 
35,000 volts or higher, and are used to provide electric 
power for the electrical equipment of residential, 
commercial, and industrial electric power users. 
Destructive voltage surges, such as those produced by 
lightning strikes, can propagate along these distribution 
systems and, if not arrested, can damage not only 
the electrical equipment of residential, commercial, 
and industrial electric power users, but also the 
transformers and other equipment of the electric power 
distribution systems. Therefore, surge arresters are 
commonly used in these high voltage electric power  
 
distribution systems in order to shunt such overvoltage 
surges to ground. A surge arrester typically used in such 
distribution systems includes a plurality of series-connected 
metal oxide varistor blocks provided in 
either a porcelain or a polymer housing. The metal 
oxide varistor blocks are connected at one end to a 
high voltage conductor of a high voltage electrical 
power distribution system and at another end to ground 
through a ground lead. Normally, the varistor blocks 
are in a high impedance condition so that the flow of 
current therethrough is small (on the order of one 
milliampere); however, when a relatively large voltage, 
e.g. due to an overvoltage surge, is impressed 
across the varistor blocks, they conduct high current 
(amperes to thousands of amperes) to thereby shunt the 
excess voltage to ground. If a metal oxide varistor fails, it typically 
fails in a runaway condition in which its temperature 
increases. This temperature increase decreases the 
resistance of the metal oxide varistor, which increases 
the current flowing therethrough, which further increases 
its temperature, and so on. If the surge 
arrester has a ceramic housing, such a failure may take 
the form of an explosion in which the surge arrester 
fragments and the metal oxide varistor blocks are  
 
expelled. If the surge arrester has a polymeric housing, 
however, failure of the arrester may only result 
in the rupture of a portion of the housing, with the 
other elements of the surge arrester
