<ABSTRACT>
The parallel and series protection module includes, in a housing, at least one lightning protector mounted between two input points and two earth points, and series protection components connected between the two input points and two output points. It is characterised in that it further includes two neon lamps (7A, 7B), mounted in the housing (10) and each linked through a resistor (7A, 7B) between one of the input points (1B) and the earth point (3). Application: protection of telephone lines

<CLAIMS>
Parallel and series protection module including in a 
casing at least one parallel protection surge arrester 

connected between two input terminals (1A, 1B) and at least 
one earth terminal (3) accessible on said casing and having a 

defined tripping voltage, series protection components 
connected between the input terminals and two output terminals 

(2A, 2B) also accessible on the casing and a short-circuit 
fusible pad associated with each surge arrester and means 

(7A, 7B) for signalling externally a malfunction of protection 
of an output line connected to said output terminals against 

voltage surges and current surges on an input line connected 
to said input terminals, characterised in that said signalling 

means comprise two lamps (7A, 7B) having a turn-on voltage 
greater than the nominal voltage of said input line, each 

connected directly to one of said input terminals (1A, 1B) and 
to said earth terminal (3), in said casing. 
Module according to claim 1 characterised in that 
said lamps (7A, 7B) have a turn-on voltage slightly greater 

than the nominal voltage of the input line and very much lower 
than the tripping voltage of each surge arrester and have a 

turn-off voltage substantially equal to said nominal voltage 
of the input line. 
Module according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised 
in that said signalling lamps (7A, 7B) are miniature neon 

lamps. 
Module according to claim 3 characterised in that 
said miniature neon lamps are connected to said earth terminal 

through a series resistor (8A, 8B). 
Module according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
said casing forms a flat rectangular plug-in module having a 

bottom, a top facing the bottom, two side walls, front and 
rear smaller sides and a handle on said front, characterised 

in that said casing (10) is compartmented transversely by a 
partition (16) very near the back, a partition (19) very near  

 
the front and at least one intermediate partition (17, 18) and 

receives each surge arrester (4A, 4B) between said partition 
(16) very near the back and the adjacent intermediate 

partition (17), said lamps on said partition (19) very near 
the front, which is notched for this purpose, and on opposite 

sides of said handle in the front (14) open for this purpose, 
and the series protection components (6A, 6B) in an 

intermediate part of the casing, each surge arrester being 
connected to at least one of two input contacts (21A, 21B) 

secured to the rear part of the bottom and to at least one 
earth contact (23A, 23B) secured to the rear part of the top, 

said series protection components being connected to the two 
input contacts and to two output contacts (22A, 22B) secured 

to the front part of the bottom, said lamps being each 
connected to one of the input contacts and to the earth 

contact in the intermediate part of the casing. 
Module according to claim 5 wherein said series 
protection components are two resistive devices having a 

cylindrical shape and a small height equipped with two opposed 
front terminals, characterised in that said casing (10) has 

two intermediate partitions (17, 18) between which each of 
said resistive devices (6A, 6B) is retained by virtue of one 

of its terminals bearing against a terminal part of one of 
said input contacts (21A, 21B), which is bent against one of 

the intermediate partitions (17), and an arcuate terminal part 
of one of said output contacts (22A, 22B) pressing against the 

other terminal.
