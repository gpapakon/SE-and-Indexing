<ABSTRACT>
On a matrix display panel (2) the return 
circuits of condensers (CS13-CS16), connected to picture 

elements (P13-P16) in the last row of the 
matrix are connected to a common line 

(Ycs) independently of the return circuits of the condensers 
in the other rows. A common electrode driving circuit (7) is 

provided, and a common electrode driving voltage (VCS) is 
applied, whereby the effective values of driving voltages 

(VD13-VD16) applied to the picture elements (P13-P16) in the 
last row are equalized to the effective values of driving 

voltages applied to the picture elements (P1-P12) in the other 
rows. Thereby, all the picture elements forming the panel (2) 

are equal in optical transmissivity, and as a result the 
displayed image quality is improved. Additionally, since the 

last scanning line can be used for displaying, the utility 
factor of display panel is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display device using
a liquid crystal display panel of an active matrix type or
the like, in particular to a display device using a display
panel in which capacitance elements are individually
connected to a plurality of picture element electrodes.Single matrix type display panels, for example, in
which a pair of light transmitting substrates sandwiching a
liquid crystal layer therebetween are opposed to each other,
a plurality of scanning electrodes are arranged on one of
the pair of substrates and a plurality of display electrodes
are arranged on the other of the pair of substrates so that
they intersect each other, are suitable for enlarging the
panels in size because of their simple constitution, so that
they have been widely used. However, since such panels have
a few problems regarding responsibility and crosstalk,
active matrix type display panels in which switching
elements are individually connected to picture elements are 
used for image display means of apparatuses such as TV
receivers and personal computers, in which images are moved
fast and a high resolution is required.Figs. 10, 11 are block diagrams showing constitutions
of display devices of the prior art. For the purpose of
simplification, in both the figures, an active matrix type
display panel 52 is presented in a 4 x 4 matrix form, namely
16 picture elements. The display devices, 51A, 51B shown in
Figs. 10, 11, respectively, have a similar constitution to
each other, and therefore the parts corresponding to each
other are represented by the same reference numerals. More
specifically, the display devices 51A, 51B are constituted
identically, excepting that the return circuits of
capacitance elements CS are connected to a counter electrode
driving circuit 56 in the prior art as shown in Fig.10, and
in the prior art as shown in Fig. 11 they are connected to a
power supplying circuit 54L for scanning. Accordingly the
following description will be mentioned in respect of the
display device 51A shown in Fig. 10.In the active matrix type display panel 52 (hereinafter
described as "display panel"), a plurality of signal lines
Y51-Y54 for scanning (when generically described,
represented by a reference numeral Y ) and a plurality of
signal lines X51-X54 for displaying (when generically
described, represented by a reference numeral X) are 
arranged to intersect each other on one of the pair of
substrates confronting each other and sandwiching a liquid
crystal layer therebetween, and in the portions where
