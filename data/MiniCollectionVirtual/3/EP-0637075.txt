<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and, in 
particular, to a semiconductor device sealed with a molded resin for use in an 
ultrahigh frequency band, which can be fabricated at low cost, and which 
exhibits low deterioration of chip performance and high reliability. FIG.1 is a sectional view showing the structure of a conventional 
semiconductor device (first conventional example). In a semiconductor device used for ultrahigh frequency amplification 
and the like, for example, in a semiconductor chip of an electric field effect 
type (including an HEMT), a fine line gate electrode (hereinafter referred to as 
a gate fine line) is formed between a drain electrode and a source electrode for 
providing performance with improved noise characteristics (NF) and increased 
gain (Ga) or the like. Specifically, it is required to be more than 0.55dB in the 
noise characteristics (NF). Normally, this semiconductor chip is enclosed in an enclosure device 
(ceramic sealing cap) 112 with a ceramic base, for outputting the 
above-mentioned NF characteristics, Ga characteristics, and the like, at good 
efficiency. This is referred to as a ceramic seal. In this method both the upper surface and the lower surface of the chip 
are covered with a sealing gas, for example, nitrogen gas, which is a so-called 
air seal. This sealing gas has a specific inductive capacity (ε) of "1" and the 
tangent of the dielectric loss angle (tan δ) is almost zero. Because this gas is 
an ideal dielectric with no power loss at high frequency, the ceramic sealing is 
the most common method used to minimize the deterioration of performance 
of the semiconductor element in high frequency service. However, in this method the cost of part materials is high, and an 
inspection of the cap seal and gas density is required. For this reason, there is 
the drawback that the manufacturing costs are high because the production  
 
efficiency is low. Molded sealing is used as a countermeasure for the problem areas of 
this first conventional example, for example, as a countermeasure for the high 
cost of members. FIG.3 is an expanded sectional view showing the vicinity of a gate fine 
line 105 for a second conventional example of the semiconductor device of the 
present invention of a structure which uses this molded sealing, illustrated in 
sectional view in FIG.2. In the method used to fabricate this second conventional example there 
is the problem that, because the gate fine line 105 is normally formed on the 
chip surface, a
