<ABSTRACT>
Bone-associated proteins derived from bone of mammals including mice, human 
beings, named OSF-6. The protein is the novel natural type mammal protein which 

can play an important role in bone formation and belongs to a group of transcription 
control factors. 
OSF-6 can be used as a therapeutic agent for bone metabolic diseases and also 
as a diagnostic agent for bone metabolic diseases since it may demonstrate a high 

organ specificity to bone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a novel bone-associated protein. More particularly, 
the protein of the present invention is named OSF-6, and belongs to a group 
of transcription control factor molecules. In addition, this OSF-6 can be obtained 
from bone of mammals, including mice and humans. Moreover, the present invention 
provides a process for producing OSF-6 by recombinant gene technology 
using cultured cells such as animal cells. The diseases generally referred to as bone metabolic diseases may include osteoporosis, 
Paget's disease, osteomalacia, hyperostotic disease, osteopetrosis and 
the like. Osteoporosis has particularly a high incidence among over 
approximately half of the population of women after the menopause and older 
persons so that the diagnosis and effective therapy therefor have been strongly 
required.  Bone metabolic diseases are accompanied with any affects of the metabolism 
specific to bone at the cellular level in bone and it may be a very useful tool for 
elucidating the abnormal metabolism to discover, isolate and identify the factors 
capable of specifically participating in bone metabolism. The present inventors 
have made earnest studies to find out one of the specific factors to such bone 
metabolism and finally completed the present invention. In the concrete, the present inventors particularly identified a protein factor 
specifically produced by a cell line of osteoblast that plays a major role in bone 
formation. Moreover, the present invention provides a novel essentially 
bone-specific protein named OSF-6 that was obtained by the said research, and 
that has strong homology in terms of various previously known transcription 
control factors at the amino acid level. The OSF-6 of the present invention is to be produced according to any 
conventional genetic engineering techniques well-known to those skilled in the art 
using the DNA sequence as disclosed herein, or OSF-6 or fragment thereof is to 
be also produced from the amino acid sequence as disclosed herein according to 
a chemical peptide synthesis method. Moreover, the partial sequence of the DNA 
sequence of the present OSF-6 as disclosed herein, which is highly specific to 
other transcription control factors, is to be synthesized with a 15-50 base length  
 
according to a conventional oligonucleotide synthesis method, and it is to be 
applied as the DNA probe for distinction and diagnosis of bone-derived cells. The 
distinction of bone-derived cells is useful especially for distinction of origin of
