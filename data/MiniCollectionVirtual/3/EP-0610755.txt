<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a generally cylindrical filter medium and a filter 
element employing said medium is provided, where the filter medium is 

pleated and comprises a multi-layered structure of overlapping layers of 
membrane material. The filter element is particularly suited for separating 

immunoglobulin from a fluid, where the filter medium is first treated 
with an activating agent to from activated sites on the membrane surface. 

The thus treated membrane is then again treated with a protein, 
specific to a certain immunoglobulin. The fluid containing the immunoglobulin 

to be separated is then passed through the filter medium, 
whereby the immunoglobulin is separated cleanly at the activated sites.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a generally 
cylindrical filter medium and to an affinity separation device comprising 
such a filter medium. The invention further relates to the use of such 
devices for separating a component such as immunoglobulin from a fluid. The invention generally relates to the field of affinity separation of 
biological substances from a fluid. Typical substances are 
immunoglobulins or proteins and are generally referred to herein as 
"ligates". A common procedure for removing biological substances from a fluid 
involves passing the fluid through a packed column containing a polysaccharide 
gel in the form of beads. The separation procedure is not 
satisfactory for a number of reasons. The column allows only a low flow 
rate of the fluid. The time required for separation is correspondingly 
long and the amount of immunoglobulin recovered per hour is relatively 
small. Affinity separation may also be performed with layers of porous membrane 
material with glass beads embedded therein. This procedure, 
however, would be difficult to scale up to achieve desired quantities in 
the range of hundreds of milligrams of immunoglobulin. Breakthrough of 
the immunoglobulin can occur after relatively short operational times due 
to reduced depth of the filter, lowering the efficiency of the process. A considerable need exists in the art for separation methods and devices 
by which larger quantities of the ligate, e.g. immunoglobulin can be  
 
extracted. It is an object of the present invention to provide a device 
and a method for producing a device which overcomes the above mentioned 
drawbacks, is simple and inexpensive in fabrication and is capable 
of separating larger quantities of immunoglobulin. A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of 
separation, making use of the claimed filter element, which gives both 
cleanly separated immunoglobulin (less contaminates), also has a high 
separation efficiency and is fast compared with column techniques. In accordance with the invention a method of producing a generally 
cylindrical filter medium for a filter element is provided as defined in 
the claims. An elongate piece of membrane material is wrapped to form 
a hollow structure made up of overlaying layers. Preferably the wrapping 
takes place about a cylinder or roller. Pleats are then formed in the 
hollow structure, which extend along the length of and parallel to a 
longitudinal axis of the generally cylindrical filter medium. Any
