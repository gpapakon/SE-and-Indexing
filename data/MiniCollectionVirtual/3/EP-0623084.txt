<ABSTRACT>
A process for draining a residue (14) of liquid from the bottom (10a) of a tank (10) via a drain pipe (15) between the tank bottom and a pump (16), which is arranged at a level above the top (10b) of the tank, the pump (16) establishing a gas/liquid current in the drain pipe (15). At distinct levels (a1, a2) in the drain pipe (15) between the bottom (10a) of the tank (10) and the pump (16) gas medium is supplied to the gas/liquid current. A draining arrangement (13) has in the associated drain pipe (15) throttle nozzle openings (19a, 19b) for the supply of gas medium to the interior of the drain pipe (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and an arrangement for
draining a residue of liquid from the bottom of a tank.On draining a tank from its upper side there are
limited possibilities of being able to lift a liquid
column in a suction pipe by conventional means. A liquid
having a density of for example 1 kg/dm3 can theoretically
be lifted by the effect of suction a height of 10 m, while
in practice it can only be lifted a lifting height of
about 7 m. In practice on lifting a liquid by the effect
of suction one will be dependent on the specific gravity
of the liquid and in addition its specific vapour pressure,
the liquid which has a low vapour pressure beginning
to "boil" at high suction pressures.On pumping liquids out from a tank over large lifting
heights, especially from a tank on board a tanker, it
is usual to employ a pump aggregate, which has the pump
submerged in the liquid of the tank just above the bottom 
of the tank and which has the intake of the pump arranged 
in a well-forming countersinking in the bottom of the
tank. By this the liquid column can be lifted with a compressive
force instead of a suction force. In tankers 20
meters lifting height is a typical lifting height for liquid
which is to be discharged. With an arrangement with a
submerged pump there is the possibility of draining the
tank relatively rapidly and effectively with such lifting
heights and also with greater lifting heights. In a final
phase of the emptying certain liquid residues can be discharged
by "stripping", that is to say for example by the
air scavenging of substantial portions of the liquid which
are left in the pump aggregate. All the time the question
here is to "press" liquid upwardly through the drain pipe.
However, at the termination of the discharge sequence,
some of the liquid will in practice always leak back to
the bottom of the tank. It has not been possible in practice
to drain this final residue from the tank in a ready
manner by mechanical means. In certain instances one has
been obliged to remove a final residue from the well-forming
countersinking of the order of magnitude of 50-100
litres manually or in another complicated manner.In the publication INDUSTRIELL TEKNIK
INDUSTRITIDNINGEN NORDEN, Volume 3, March 1973, Stockholm,
Patentprofylax 9/73 is stated a process for draining of
risidue of liquid from the bottom of a tank by use of a
pump and a drain pipe, wherein a gas medium is supplied so
as to create a gas/liquid current and wherein the gas
medium is entering the drain pipe together

Process for draining residue (14') of liquid from
the bottom (10a) of a tank (10) via a drain pipe

(15, 15') arranged between the tank bottom and a pump
(16) or ejector, which pump or ejector is arranged at a

level substantially above the bottom (10a) of the tank
and preferably above the top (10b) of the tank, whereas

the pump (16) or the ejector establishes a gas/liquid
current in the drain pipe (15, 15') between the bottom of

the tank and the pump or the ejector whereas gas medium
is supplied to the drain pipe (15, 15') at a level above

the bottom (10a) of the tank (10), 
characterised

by mixing the gas medium with the liquid medium
within the drain pipe (15, 15') by supplying gas medium

via a gas supply conduit (21) which is separately received
in the drain pipe (15, 15') and which has at least one

gas outlet opening (22a, 22b; 25) into the current flowing
in the drain pipe (15, 15') at one or more distinct

levels (a1, a2) in the drain pipe (15, 15') between the
liquid inlet opening (13a) of the drain pipe (15, 15') at

the bottom of the tank and the pump (16) or ejector.
Draining arrangement (13, 13') for draining residue
(14') of liquid from the bottom (10a) of a tank (10)

comprising a drain pipe (15, 15') arranged between the
tank bottom (10a) and a pump (16) or ejector, which pump

or ejector is arranged at a level above the bottom (10a)
of the tank and preferably above the top (10b) of the

tank, whereas the pump (16) or the ejector establishes a
gas/liquid current in the drain pipe (15, 15') between

the bottom (10a) of the tank (10) and the pump and means
is arranged to supply gas medium to the drain pipe (15, 

15') at a level above the bottom (10a) of the tank (10),

characterised
 in that a gas supply conduit
(21) is separately received in the drain pipe and has one

or more gas outlets (22a, 22b; 25) provided at one or
more distinct levels (a1, a2) between the liquid inlet

opening (13a) of the drain pipe (15, 15') at the bottom
of the tank and the pump (16) or ejector to supply gas

medium separately into the current flowing in the drain
pipe (15, 15') and to mix the gas medium with the liquid

medium within the drain pipe (15, 15').
Draining arrangement in accordance with claim 2,

characterised
 in that the gas supply
conduit (21) is connected to a supply source of compressed

gas with an associated regulating valve (23) for
supplying compressed gas having a regulatable pressure

and having a regulatable amount of compressed gas.
Draining arrangement in accordance with claim 2 or 3,

characterised
 in that the gas
supply conduit (21) forms an ejector mechanism internally

in the drain pipe (15').
