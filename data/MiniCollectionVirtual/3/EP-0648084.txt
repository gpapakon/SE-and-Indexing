 A DISPENSING DEVICE AND A BATHROOM ORGANIZER INCORPORATING SAMEThis invention relates to a means for dispensing a viscous material.Product dispensers are well know, for example U.S. Patent No. 2,718,335 to Shippen discloses a multiple dispenser that includes a plurality of containers for discharging dry materials, such as flour or spice, through openings in the bottom of the containers. The material is discharged through the force of gravity. Other references, such as United States Patent No. 3,130,873 to Klutz, Jr. and U.S. Patent No. 3,718,234 to Bagguley, teach multiple dispensers utilising a propellant to expel material retained in the dispensing containers.Manually operated product dispensers are also known. For example U.S. Patent No. 3,990,611 to Sojka discloses plural metering toiletry dispensers each in the nature of a displacement pump.Known product dispensers do not combine the features of efficiency, convenience, hygiene, and the ability to be used with a variety of liquids having a wide viscosity range (such as liquid soap, hand lotion, shaving cream, after shave lotion, hair gel, and toothpaste) while avoiding the use of aerosols which may have an environmentally deleterious impact. Further, known multiple product dispensers do not maximize space utilisation in a bathroom environment nor avoid bathroom clutter resulting from toiletry accessories such as combs, brushes, hairpins, eyebrow pencils, toothbrushes and the like. Furthermore, many product dispensers are disposable which deleteriously impacts the environment. The present invention seeks to overcome some of these drawbacks.Accordingly, the present invention comprises a dispensing means for a viscous material comprising: (a) a reservoir for containing a viscous material, said reservoir having a basal dispensing opening; (b) an air chamber; (c) a manual pumping means actuatable to pressurize air in said air chamber; (d) venting means for venting said air chamber to 

ambient air pressure prior to actuation of said pumping means; (e) valved duct means for communicating pressurized air from said air chamber to said reservoir via a one-way non-return valve said duct terminating in a portion directed generally toward said basal dispensing opening, said duct portion incorporating said valve and having a mouth communicating with said reservoir; said valve having a valve chamber and a reciprocatable valve element, said valve configured so as to provide a cavity between said valve element and the mouth of said duct in order to trap a bubble
