<ABSTRACT>
There is described a process for the preparation of R113a from R113 and of R123 from R123a or R123b by rearrangement by means of AlCl3. On heating the reaction mixtures, great evolution of heat and running away of the reaction often occurs as a result of sudden starting of the reaction. According to the invention, a specially activated AlCl3, which has been activated by means of a metal halide selected from the group consisting of NaF.nHF where 0 
<
 n 
<
/= 2, AgCl and FeCl3, is now employed. In addition to clearly facilitating the control of the reaction conditions, shorter reaction times are to be observed for the rearrangement with formation of a smaller amount of by-products.
