<ABSTRACT>
An improved multi-layer paper sheet forming system 
is disclosed, in which a degree of dispersion of fibers 

under the condition where a paper layer has been formed is 
large, thereby formation of a paper sheet is improved, 

moreover, bases of short wire cloth sections can be 
installed at the same level as a building floor and a 

complicated base of the shape of steps is not necessitated. 
The system comprises one endless felt loop (12) and a 

plurality of short wire cloth sections (5) disposed on the 
endless felt (12) and provided with a dewatering instrument 

(3) having, as dewatering elements, forming blades (3a) 
consisting of two zones, that is, a flat front half and a 

curved rear half. The short wire cloth section (5) includes 
a forming roll (6) having a large diameter and a breast roll 

(2) having a small diameter, and the plurality of short wire 
cloth sections (5
) are disposed substantially at the same 
level. A movable return roll (9) is equipped, which raises 

the felt (12) between the adjacent short wire cloth sections 
(5) so as to wrap around the short wire cloth (5') so that 

an initial engagement point between the felt (12) and the 
short wire cloth (5') may come to an arbitrary position of 

the curved portion of the dewatering instrument (3) existing 
at the upper portion of the short wire cloth section (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-layer
paper sheet forming system
as defined in the preamble portion of claim 1
applicable to a paper making
machine.One example of a multi-layer paper sheet forming
system in the prior art is illustrated in Fig. 9, which is
a front view of a wet end of short wire cloth duplex paper
making machine. In Fig. 9, stock liquor ejected from
a head-box 015 is formed into a paper layer by means of
a conventional table instrument 016 (not shown in detail)
disposed on a short wire cloth 017. This paper layer is
engaged with an endless felt 018 on a forming cylinder 20,
while it is being dewatered by an urging pressure of the
felt, it is combined with a paper layer formed in a
preceding unit and having been carried by the felt, and
under the state of being sandwiched between the felt and
the short wire cloth, it is carried to a section of a
turning roll 021, where bonding of the above-described both
paper layers is effected by pressing with a turning touch
roll 024. Thereafter, the wet paper layer is conveyed to
the next unit as loaded on the felt. Fig. 10 shows another example of a multi-layer
paper forming system in the prior art. The system of this
example attempted to enlarge a dewatering capability by
constructing a paper layer forming apparatus making use of
two wire cloths in a short wire cloth section. Stock liquor
ejected from a headbox 015' is dewatered by a conventional
table instrument 016' (not shown in detail) disposed within
a loop of the short wire cloth 025 and thereby a paper layer
on the under side is formed.Next, the paper layer is dewatered to the outside
by a wire tension of another short wire cloth 026 coming
into engagement on a forming cylinder 020' and a centrifugal
force, and thereby an upper side portion of the paper layer
is formed. Thereafter, the wet paper layer riding on the
short wire cloth 025 is bonded with a paper layer formed in
a short wire cloth section of the preceding stage and
carried by a felt 018', by means of a couch roll 027 at the
location where the same short wire cloth 025 is engaged with
the felt 018'. The thus combined multi-layer paper sheet is
either picked up by a suction pick-up roll 028 or
transferred to the next stage (press part) by open-drawing.Fig. 11 shows still another example of a multi-layer
paper sheet forming system in the prior art. The
system shown in Fig. 11 is a wet end of a general composite
paper machine making use of a circular wire cylinder 022a 
shown in Fig. 12 or a suction cylinder 022b (circular

<CLAIMS>
A multi-layer paper sheet forming system, including

one endless felt loop (12) and a plurality of short wire
cloth sections (5) each having an endless short wire cloth

(5') and a dewatering instrument (3);
said plurality of short wire cloth sections (5) are
disposed substantially at the same level, wherein, while the

felt (12) is traveling with a stock liquor sandwiched between
the short wire cloth (5') and the felt (12), combined

formation of paper layer is effected;
wherein said felt (12) is engaged with the stock liquor
and the short wire cloth (5') at a curved portion of said

dewatering instrument (3); and
wherein each of the short wire cloth sections disposed
on the endless felt loop (12) has the endless short wire

cloth (5') and the dewatering instrument (3) disposed in such
manner that a part of the upper surface of the dewatering

element (3a) thereof has the curvature;

   
characterized in that
a movable return roll (9) is disposed so that it may
raise or lower the felt (12) between short wire cloth

sections (5) so as to wrap around the short wire cloth (5')

to thereby move an initial engagement point between the felt
(12) and the short wire cloth (5') to an arbitrary position

of said curved portion of said dewatering instrument (3).
A multi-layer paper sheet forming system as claimed
in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each said short wire cloth
section (5) is constructed in such manner that the short wire

cloth (5') travels as engaged with the curved portion of said
dewatering instrument (3), a forming roll (6) having a large

diameter and a breast roll (10) having a small diameter. 
A multi-layer paper sheet forming system as claimed
in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 said system further
comprises a shoe blade (4a) disposed within a felt loop above

said dewatering instrument (3) so as to oppose to said
dewatering instrument (3) and supported in such manner that

an urging pressure against the felt (12) may be variable, and
the surface of the shoe blade (4a) consists of a portion held

in contact with the felt (12) and the other portion inclined
towards the felt (12), so that a wedge space converging in

the traveling direction of the felt (12) is formed between
the inclined portion and the felt (12).
A multi-layer paper sheet forming system as claimed

 said dewatering
instrument (3) of the short wire cloth (5') has a structure
