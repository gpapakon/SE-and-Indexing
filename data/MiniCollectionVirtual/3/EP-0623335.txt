<ABSTRACT>
A moldable dental composition including high-fusing 
temperature metal particles and a binder comprising wax preferably in a 

concentration of above at least twenty percent (20%) of the composition. 
The high-fusing temperature metal particles should have an irregular non-spherical 

geometry and a thin cross-sectional average thickness. The 
moldable dental composition may also contain low fusing temperature 

metal particles for enhanced wetting of the high fusing metal particles 
during heat treatment at a heat treatment temperature which will 

substantially melt the low fusing metal particles. However it is not 
essential to the subject invention for the composition to contain low fusing 

metal particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a moldable dental material
composition.A metal coping is used in dentistry in the construction of a
dental crown and bridge. The metal coping functions as the understructure
of the crown and is usually covered, for reasons of aesthetics, with a
fired-on coating of ceramic porcelain composition or an acrylic. The metal
coping supports the coating and provides the required structural strength
and rigidity for the restored tooth to resist the forces of mastication.The customary practice is to cast the metal coping from an
investment of a wax or plastic pattern of the tooth to be restored. The
restoration formed using this procedure is conventionally referred to as a
cast metal restoration. A metal coping has recently been developed for
constructing a porcelain to metal crown which does not require waxing,
investing or casting. The coping is formed from a prefabricated metal foil
arranged in a prefolded configuration, with a plurality of foldable sections,
as described in more detail, in Reissue Patent No. 33,099, which issued
to Applicant on October 24, 1989. An alternative method of forming a
dental coping from a metal foil is taught by Applicant in U.S. Patent No. 
4,861,267, which issued on August 29, 1989. In each instance, the
starting material for forming the coping is a solid metal foil formed from
a lamination of solid metal layers, each of a precious metal.As an alternative to the use of a prefabricated metal foil,
Applicant developed a dental material composition, as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,997,699, which is capable of being molded into a desired
shape, which is self-supporting in the molded configuration, and which will
retain the shape in which it is molded under heat treatment. The dental
material, as taught in the aforementioned patent, the disclosure of which
is herein incorporated by reference, comprises a metal composition,
including particles of high-fusing temperature metal having a melting
temperature above a preselected heat-treatment temperature, and metal
particles of a low-fusing temperature, which substantially melts during
heat treatment at such heat-treatment temperature to form a porous,
sponge-like structure, with the high-fusing temperature metal particles
interconnected by the melted, low-fusing temperature metal. Applicant
further teaches in U.S. Patent No. 4,990,394 (corresponding to
European patent application EP 0 397 117 A2) that the porous,
sponge-like structure should provide a total void volume of
between twenty (20%) to eighty percent
