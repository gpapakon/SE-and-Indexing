<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the compounds of formula I 

wherein the substituents have various significances, in free form and, where such forms 
exist, in salt form. 
They can be prepared by various processes, e.g. by irradiation; oxidation; 
elimination; reduction; conversion by e.g. halogenation or acylation; deprotection of 

protected hydroxy groups; protection of free hydroxy groups; and separation of 
stereoisomeric mixtures into individual isomers. 
They are indicated for use as pharmaceuticals, especially as antiinflammatory, 
and as antiproliferative and antiinflammatory agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of macrolides, especially
tetrahydropyran derivatives. It concerns more particularly the compounds
of formula Ip1, Ip2, Ip3 or Ip4 wherein
formula Ip1 is

wherein
R2p and R7pare the same or different and represent hydroxy optionally protected by
tert-butoxycarbonyl or tri(C1-4)alkylsilyl;R3represents methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or allyl;R8represents hydroxy or methoxy; andnrepresents the number 1 or 2;
formula Ip2 is

wherein the substituents are as defined above ; 
formula Ip4 is
wherein
R2'prepresents hydrogen or hydroxy optionally protected by tert-butoxycarbonyl or
tri(C1-4)alkylsilyl and there is a single or a double bond between the two carbon atoms
joined by a dotted line;either R5represents hydroxy and R5a represents hydrogen,or R5 and R5atogether represent oxo; andR3, R7p, R8 and nare as defined above ; and
formula Ip5 is

wherein 
Arepresents a group of formula -CH(OR6)-CH2-(CH2)n- or -CH=CH-(CH2)n-, whereby the
(CH2)n- part thereof is linked to the carbon atom, andR6represents alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms; andR2'p , R3, R5, R5a, R7p, R8 and nare as defined above,
in free form and, where such forms exist, in salt form, hereinafter briefly named "the
compounds of the invention".R2p and R7p preferably represent hydroxy. R3 preferably represents ethyl or allyl,
especially ethyl. Preferred are the compounds of formula Ip2 and Ip5. R5 preferably represents
together with R5a oxo. R6 preferably represents methyl or ethyl. R8 preferably represents
methoxy. A preferably represents a group of formula -CH-CH-(CH2)n- .Alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms is linear or branched, especially of 1 or 2, particularly
1 carbon atom(s). Hydroxy preferably is free hydroxy, i.e. unprotected.Preferably there is a single bond between the two carbon atoms joined by a dotted
line. The compounds of the invention have a number of chiral centers and may thus
exist in a variety of stereoisomers. The process variants of the invention result normally in
a mixture of such isomers. Depending on the conditions and the type of reaction the
process can be steered in such manner that a specific isomer preferably is produced. The
invention provides all stereo- and optical isomers as well as racemic mixtures. The isomers
may be resolved or separated by conventional techniques. The preferred stereochemistry
at various chiral carbon atoms is shown in formula Is:
The preferred stereochemistry at the cyclohexyl moiety is shown by formula
When R5 is hydroxy it preferably is in the α-configuration.The moiety
