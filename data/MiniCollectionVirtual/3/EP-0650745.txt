rubber thread layer (2) formed around the liquid center (1) 

and a cover (3) covering the rubber thread layer (2), 
wherein said liquid center (1) has a diameter (L1) of 29.5 

to 32.0 mm and the ratio, Y, of the sum total of the flat 
surface area (5S) of dimples (5) to the surface area (G-1) 

of the same sphere having no dimples formed thereon is 
within the range of 0.80 to 0.84. The total volumes of 

dimples (5) are in the range of 290 to 340 mm³. The dimples 
(5) include a plurality of kinds of dimples having different 

diameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a golf ball
comprising a liquid center, a rubber thread layer formed
around the liquid center and a cover covering the rubber
thread layer and more particularly to a golf ball having a
liquid center of a large diameter so as to increase flight
distance, in which trajectory is optimized by improvement
of the ratio of the total surface area of dimples to the
total surface area of the golf ball.Normally, 300 to 500 dimples in number are
provided on the surface of a golf ball so as to improve
aerodynamic characteristics of the golf ball through
increase of the flight distance and optimization of the
trajectory.There are many dimple factors which affect the
trajectory of the golf ball. One of the factors which has
a large influence on the trajectory is the ratio of the
total area of the dimples to the surface area of the golf
ball, i.e. surface area occupying rate of the dimples.Conventionally, in view of the surface area
occupying rate of the dimples, there are proposals of the
golf ball as listed below.
(1) In U.S. Pat. No. 4,804,189, the surface area
occupying rate of the dimples is set to be more than 78% by
a combination of two kinds of large and small dimples. (2) In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3-80876
(U.S. Pat. No. 5,090,705), proposed by the present
applicant, the dimples are formed so that a value Y of the
surface area occupying rate of the dimples is within the
rangeY = 0.046X½ - 0.172
   wherein X represents the total number of dimples.As shown in Fig. 1, the golf ball G disclosed in
the above references has a liquid center 1 and a rubber
thread layer 2 formed around the liquid center 1 and a
cover 3 covering the rubber thread layer 2, in which a
diameter L1 of the liquid center 1 is about 28.3 mm, while
an outer diameter L2 of the golf ball G is 42.75 mm.
Further, the golf ball disclosed in the above references has a total volume of the dimples in the range of 290 to 370 mm2, and a total sum of surface areas surrounded by the outer edges of the dimples to the surface area of the same sphere having no dimples formed thereon is within a range of 0.735 to 0.842.Recently, in order to increase the flight distance
of the golf ball of a liquid center type, a golf ball
having a larger diameter owing to increase of the diameter
of the liquid center 1 so as not only to decrease amount of
spin at the initial stage of flying but also to increase an
angle of elevation of trajectory has been dominant.
Namely, experiments have revealed that if the diameter of
