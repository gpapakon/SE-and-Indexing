<ABSTRACT>
The specification discloses a process for stabilising radionuclides extracted during the upgrading of minerals. The process comprises forming a composition of a radionuclide and a component and roasting the composition so that the component forms a crystalline phase having a structure that binds the radionuclides. Suitable components include a compound of a lanthanide and/or phosphorus and zirconia. Zirconia in its cubic form is useful in stabilising uranium and thorium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the stabilisation of
radionuclides derived from naturally occurring materials
into forms which are not accessible to the environment and
are therefore suitable for disposal.In a particular embodiment the present invention
provides a process whereby a stable solid waste is formed
by hydrolysis and roasting of aqueous solutions or
suspensions containing radionuclides, particularly
radionuclides in the decay chains of naturally occurring
radioisotopes of uranium and thorium. In a general aspect
the process of the invention comprises two basic steps for
stabilising radionuclides present in a process stream,
namely:-
1.Ensuring the presence of a chemical composition
and distribution in the stream, which upon
roasting of the stream will be effective in
stabilisation of radionuclides into crystalline
phases such as to prevent significant immediate
redistribution of radionuclides upon disposal
into the environment.2.Roasting of the stream in such a manner as to be
effective in the formation of such phases.Additional steps may be employed as will be described
below.Various processes for the treatment of ores,
concentrates and processed materials have the effect of
taking contained radionuclides into aqueous solution or
rendering radionuclides sufficiently soluble to allow
extraction by water in the environment. For example, the
processing of uranium ores to yellowcake, the extraction of
rare earths from monazite and processes for the production
of upgraded products from mineral sands concentrates (for 
example ilmenite and zircon) result in the production of
such materials.In addition, various steps in the nuclear fuel cycle
will have the effect of rendering both naturally occurring
and synthetic radioisotopes accessible to environmental
mobilisation. As a result, wastes from such processing
must generally be stored in supervised and monitored
repositories, despite the fact that the wastes are
frequently of extremely low radioactivity.A common problem in the conversion of radionuclide
bearing wastes to stable forms is the multiplicity of
radionuclides which are normally present. For example, the
most common form of uranium, uranium 238 has 7 other
elements in its decay chain which will all be present
whenever uranium 238 is present. Similarly thorium 232 has
7 other elements in its decay chain. In order to prevent
environmental mobility all of the multiplicity of
radionuclides which are present in a waste stream must be
simultaneously stabilised into environmentally inaccessible
forms.
