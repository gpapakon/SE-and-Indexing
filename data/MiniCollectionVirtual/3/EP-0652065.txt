<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing welded steel-plate panels from individual sheet-metal plates (1, 2) cut off from steel strips suitable for the panel parts, in the course of which sheet-metal plates of several times the length of the steel-plate panels are separated from the steel strips and are welded to one another at their longitudinal edges trimmed beforehand, and then the individual steel-plate panels are cut out of the composite plates resulting from the sheet-metal plates. In order to provide such a process which also enables sheet-metal plates significantly longer than 4000 mm with straight longitudinal edges to be produced in a simple manner, the longitudinal edges (3, 4) of two sheet-metal plates (1, 2), which longitudinal edges (3, 4) are to be welded and are orientated to one another in pairs, are trimmed in a single step over the entire length.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the purpose of producing welded sheet steel plates from individual 
metal sheets (1, 2) which are separated from steel bands which are suitable for the 

plate parts, wherein metal sheets (1, 2) many times the length of sheet steel plates 
are divided from the steel bands, welded together at their longitudinal edges (3, 4), 

which beforehand are cut, and subsequently the individual sheet steel plates are 
separated from the composite sheets which have been produced from the metal 

sheets (1, 2), characterised in that the longitudinal edges (3, 4) of two metal sheets 
(1, 2) over 4000mm in length, which are aligned to each other in pairs, are cut 

together in a continuous manner over the total length. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal edges (3, 4) 
of the metal sheets (1, 2), which are aligned to each other in pairs, have edge to 

edge contact with each other. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the metal sheets (1, 2) having 
longitudinal edges (3, 4) which overlap each other and are in contact with each 

other, are cut into pairs.
