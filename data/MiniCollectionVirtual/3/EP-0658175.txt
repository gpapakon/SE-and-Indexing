<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns sheeting made from ethylene and propylene polymers optionally also containing processing aids, fillers, pigments or other additives. The sheeting is characterized in that it contains (a) a propylene homopolymer with a melt flow rate (measured at 230  DEG C and under a load of 2.16 kg) of about 0.8 to 3.0 g/10 min, a melting point Tm of about 154 to 168  DEG C (determined by differential scanning calorimetry) and an E-modulus of about 900 to 1500 N/mm

 (determined in accordance with DIN 53457) and (b) an ethylene homopolymer with a melt flow rate (measured at 190  DEG C and under a load of 2.16 kg) of about 1.5 to 3.0 g/10 min, a melting point Tm of about 110 to 130  DEG C and an E-modulus of about 200 to 400 N/mm

, in the ratio of 100 parts by wt. of the propylene homopolymer to about 5 to 20 parts by wt. of the ethylene homopolymer. The sheeting can be used in the form of self-adhesive composite sheets suitable for the lamination-coating of any kind of object.
