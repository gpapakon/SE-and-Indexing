<ABSTRACT>
In a trailable railway switch drive a coupling device (3) is arranged between a drive unit and the push rod (1) and has a securing roller (10) which is spring loaded in the coupled-end state and engages in a depression (9) of the push rod (1). In order to be able to realise such a coupling device even when the space available is very restricted, two counter rollers (12, 12') are provided which are arranged essentially symmetrically with respect to the direction of movement of the securing roller (10) and are mounted so as to be capable of moving essentially perpendicularly with respect to the direction of movement of the securing roller (10) and are loaded by at least one securing spring (13) in the direction in which they bear against the securing roller (10).

Upwardly movable switch-point drive with a thrust rod
which shifts the switch-point tongues, and also with

a coupling device which is disposed between a driving
unit and the thrust rod and has a retaining roller

which, in the coupled condition, engages in a springloaded
manner in a recess in the thrust rod and, when

the switch point moves upwards, moves out of the
recess (9) against the force of the spring in one

direction of movement, 
characterised in that
 two
counter-rollers (12, 12') are provided which are

disposed substantially symmetrically with respect to
the direction of movement of the retaining roller

(10) and are mounted so as to be displaceable
essentially perpendicularly to the direction of

movement of the said retaining roller (10) and which
are loaded by at least one retaining spring (13) in

the direction of abutment against the retaining
roller (10).
Switch-point drive according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the retaining spring (13) is
constructed as a helical compression spring and is

disposed essentially parallel with the thrust rod
(1) .
Switch-point drive according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the retaining roller (10) is
mounted, at least on one side, in a sliding block

(11) which is guided, perpendicularly to the thrust
rod (1), in a housing (4) belonging to the coupling

device (3), and that the two counter-rollers (12,
12') are disposed on counter-roller housings (14, 15)

which are displaceable, parallel with the thrust rod
(1), in the housing (4) of the coupling device (3)

and are loaded against one another via the retaining
spring (13). 
Switch-point drive according to claim 3,

characterised in that
 a single retaining spring (13)
acts, on the one hand, directly on one of the

counter-roller housings (14) and, on the other hand,
on the other counter-roller housing (15) via a

tensioning piece (16) with an adjusting screw (17)
and via transmission bars (18).
