<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a 22-oxacholecalciferol 
derivative expected useful as a drug 
and a process for preparing the 22-oxacholecalciferol 
derivative. 22-Oxacholecalciferol derivatives have hitherto 
been prepared by, for example, the process starting with 
a compound represented by formula (II): 
 
wherein R4 represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group 
or a protected hydroxyl group; R5 represents a hydroxyl 
group or a protected hydroxyl group; and R6 and R7 represent 
a hydrogen atom respectively or they are taken together to 
form a double bond, 
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 
267550/86. This process, as illustrated by the following 
reaction scheme (1), comprises reacting the compound of 
formula (II) with 1-bromo-3-propene in the presence of 
a basic catalyst to form a 20S-(3-butenyloxy) compound,  
 
oxidizing the 20S-(3-butenyloxy) compound with oxygen in 
the presence of a catalyst to obtain a 20S-(3-oxobutyloxy) 
compound, and reacting the 20S-(3-oxobutyloxy) compound 
with a Grignard reagent to obtain a 20S-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyloxy) 
compound. 
However, the above process requires complicated 
operation. In addition, since the reaction between 
the compound (II) and 1-bromo-3-propene is attended by 
by-production of a 20S-(2-butenyloxy) compound in a 
considerable proportion, resulting in a low yield of 
the desired compound, and separation and purification 
of the desired compound involves difficulty.  
 As a result of extensive investigations, the 
inventors have found a technique for constructing the side 
chain by O-alkylating the 20-hydroxyl group with a compound 
represented by formula (III): 
CH2=CH-COR8 
wherein R8 represents a dialkylamino group having from 1 to 
5 carbon atoms, 
and reached the present invention based on this finding. 
The process of the present invention starts from a compound 
represented by formula (II): 
 
wherein R4 represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group or 
a protected hydroxyl group; R5 represents a hydroxyl group 
or a protected hydroxyl group; and R6 and R7 represent a 
hydrogen atom respectively or they are taken together to 
form a double bond. The compound of formula (II) can be synthesized by, 
for example, the process disclosed in Japanese Patent Public 
Disclosure No. 267550/86.  
 Where starting with the compound of formula (II) in 
which the hydroxyl group(s) are protected, the protecting 
groups for a hydroxyl group include those which are not 
released under a basic condition, such as lower alkylsilyl 
groups,
