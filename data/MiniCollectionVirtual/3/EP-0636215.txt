<ABSTRACT>
An axial locking device has locking balls (5) which engage in a groove (4) in a male member (2) to lock the male member (2) to a female member (1). To effect locking, a first axial movement of the male member (2) causes it to abut an end surface on a slider (8) and pushes slider teeth (9) against rotor teeth (11), and a return movement of the male member (2) allows the slider (8) and rotor (12) to return, pushed by a spring (13). In this way, the rotor (12) is caused to rotate and its internal cam surface moves the locking balls (5). To reduce the number of parts and simplify manufacture, retaining teeth (10) are formed by U-shaped clips on the housing (6) of the female member (1), and act to prevent rotation of the slider (8) during its axial movement, and to prevent rotation of the rotor (12) until the rotor teeth (11) have cleared the retaining teeth (10), causing a click or snap action. During the return movement of the slider (8) and rotor (12), the rotor teeth (11) cam over the ends of the retaining teeth (10) and continue to rotate the rotor (12) in the same direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an axial locking device
of the type for locking first and second separable
members together by movement of the members relative to
each other in one axial sense, followed by a relative
return movement, and unlocking the members by a further
relative movement in the first axial sense (repeat first
relative movement), the device comprising a locking
mechanism associated with the first member, the locking
mechanism comprising a locking element for engaging the
second member, to lock the members together, actuating
means movable with respect to the first member and
engageable by the second member when said relative
movement occurs in the first axial sense, to initiate
(or cause) actuation of the locking mechanism, locking
means which are relatively rotatable about an axis of
relative movement between the two members to actuate the
locking element, first, toothed thrust means associated
with said actuating means, and second, toothed thrust
means which co-act with the first thrust means and are
connected to the locking means to rotate the locking
means and hence actuate the locking element, spring
means for biassing the second thrust means axially
against the first thrust means, and retaining means
which are substantially fixed in a rotary sense with
respect to the first thrust means and relative to which
the second thrust means move axially during actuation,
during said relative movement in the first sense a
respective tooth of the second thrust means sliding
against the retaining means until the tooth reaches the
end of the retaining means, when the second thrust means
tooth is rotated by the respective tooth of 
the first thrust means, and during said return movement,
said second thrust means tooth being able to cam over
the end of the retaining means to rotate the second
thrust means in the same rotary sense.Such an axial locking device is described in WO
90/15282 and there is in US 4 709 454 a description of a precursor of the device of WO90/15282. Some uses of the devices are given for
instance on pages 2, 3, 41 and 42 of WO 90/15282. The
devices can have high wear capability and can accept
wide manufacturing tolerances. As stress does not pass
through the teeth of the thrust means, high strength can
be achieved. The devices are easily produced in a wide
range of materials, in general of any suitable rigid
material, and can be produced in any size and in a wide
range of quality levels, from aerospace to consumer
products. In general, the devices can be used with any
type
