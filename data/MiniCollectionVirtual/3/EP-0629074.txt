<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary scanner,
and more specifically to a rotary scanner for scanning a
light beam emitted from a light source on a light receiving
surface.A light beam scanning system provided with a polygonal
mirror has been developed into various types to be used
as an image writing device and an image reading device. The
polygonal mirror is driven to rotate by a motor at a constant
speed. If the motor cannot keep the constant speed, accurate
image formation will be impossible. Incidentally, motors are
classified into brush motors and brushless motors, and a
brushless motor is used to drive the polygonal mirror.
Brushless motors are good in the accuracy of rotation but
expensive. Brush motors are inexpensive. However, since
brush motors are inferior in the accuracy of rotation, they
have not been used for driving a polygonal mirror. A rotary scanner according to the pre-characterizing part
of claim 1 is known from US-A-4,538,081.An example of a brushless motor comprising a magnetic pole
position detecting device is disclosed in document US-A-5,184,038.The problem of torque ripple in a DC-motor having a plurality
of commutator segments and brushes is addressed by JP-A-59220058.An object of the present invention is to provide a
rotary scanner which has a brush motor as the drive source
and can form an accurate image.According to the present invention, this object is achieved
by a rotary scanner according to claim 1. The further claims
are related to advantageous aspects of the present invention. The inventors conducted various tests of brush motors,
which are inexpensive and inferior in the accuracy of
rotation. As a result, the followings were found out: when a
commutator segment comes out of contact with a brush and
another commutator segment comes into contact with the brush,
that is, in a moment of commutation, an induced voltage
occurs, which changes the torque and changes the rotating
speed of the brush motor; and in other moments, the brush
motor can keep a constant speed as a brushless motor does.Therefore, it should be found out at what rotation
angle of the rotary scanner commutation occurs, and scanning
should be performed during rotation of the rotary scanner
within a range excluding the angle where commutation occurs.
In this way, practically a brush motor can work as a brushless
motor does.The present invention is based on the discovery. A
rotary scanner according to the present invention comprises a
mirror which has at least one deflecting facet, and a motor
for
